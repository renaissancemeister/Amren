	<p><i>Poor Mexico. So far from God and so close to the United States.<br>
  &mdash;  Porfirio Díaz, dictator of Mexico from 1876 to 1880 and 1884 to 1911</i></p>
<p>Those famous words came to mind when another man named Díaz offered me an equally concise observation about the realities of life in the country today: &#8220;In Mexico it is dangerous to speak the truth. It is even dangerous to know the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>His full name is Fernando Díaz Santana. He hosts two AM-radio news-and-commentary shows in the small Chihuahuan city of Nuevo Casas Grandes. {snip}</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s received text messages from listeners cautioning him to be careful of what he says on the air. He takes these friendly warnings seriously; failure to heed them could bring a death sentence like the one meted out to Armando Rodríguez, a crime reporter murdered by an unidentified gunman in November 2008 in Juárez, the violent border city across the Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas. The fear of suffering a similar fate is a powerful incentive for self-censorship, for training a naturally inquisitive mind to acquire ignorance.</p>
<p>&#8220;So now we give just the objective facts,&#8221; Díaz says as he sits facing me in a stuffy, windowless rear room of the radio station, in Nuevo Casas Grandes&rsquo;s central business district. He and the co-host of his afternoon show, David Andrew (pronounced Da-veed An-dray-oo), explain that the &#8220;objective facts&#8221; are those reported by the police or city hall or some other official source. Though the accuracy of such facts is often questionable, no questions dare be asked. &#8220;We say nothing more,&#8221; Díaz adds. &#8220;As long as we don&rsquo;t get too deeply into a story, we are safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 14,000 people have been killed in the almost three years since President Felipe Calderón mobilized the army to fight Mexico&rsquo;s half-dozen major drug cartels. Virtually none of those homicides has been solved, partly because witnesses suffer short-term memory loss when questioned, and partly because the police, for various reasons, also feel profoundly that things do not stand much looking into.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>To clarify the crime. </b>Of the many things Mexico lacks these days, clarity is near the top of the list. It is dangerous to know the truth. Finding it is frustrating. Statements by U.S. and Mexican government officials, repeated by a news media that prefers simple story lines, have fostered the impression in the United States that the conflict in Mexico is between Calderón&rsquo;s white hats and the crime syndicates&rsquo; black hats. The reality is far more complicated, as suggested by this statistic: out of those 14,000 dead, fewer than 100 have been soldiers. Presumably, army casualties would be far higher if the war were as straightforward as it&rsquo;s often made out to be.</p>
<p>What, then, accounts for the carnage, the worst Mexico has suffered since the revolution, a century ago? To be sure, many of the dead have been cartel criminals. Some were killed in firefights with the army, others in battles between the cartels for control of smuggling routes, and still others in power struggles within the cartels. The toll includes more than 1,000 police officers, some of whom, according to Mexican press reports, were executed by soldiers for suspected links to drug traffickers. Conversely, a number of the fallen soldiers may have been killed by policemen moonlighting as cartel hit men, though that cannot be proved. Meanwhile, human-rights groups have accused the military of unleashing a reign of terror  &mdash;  carrying out forced disappearances, illegal detentions, acts of torture, and assassinations  &mdash;  not only to fight organized crime but also to suppress dissidents and other political troublemakers. What began as a war on drug trafficking has evolved into a low-intensity civil war with more than two sides and no white hats, only shades of black. The ordinary Mexican citizen  &mdash;  never sure who is on what side, or who is fighting whom and for what reason  &mdash;  retreats into a private world where he becomes willfully blind, deaf, and above all, dumb.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But why, I asked, would soldiers maraud the countryside on a murder-and-kidnapping spree? He [Díaz] replied that the raid was not part of the Mexican government&rsquo;s war on the drug cartels but a struggle between two powerful cartels: the Juárez organization, headed by Vicente Carillo, and the Sinaloa federation, whose boss, Joaquín &#8220;El Chapo&#8221; Guzmán, is the most-wanted man in Mexico. Gutiérrez said that in this instance the gunmen, whoever they were, had been after people they thought were working for the Juárez cartel.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s an open secret in Mexico,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that the army is fighting the [Juárez] cartel to weaken them and pave the way for Guzmán.&#8221;</p>
<p>Open secret or no, an allegation that soldiers may have acted on behalf of a drug lord needs to be substantiated. After all, Calderón&rsquo;s counter-narcotics strategy relies, with U.S. support, almost exclusively on the military.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the Mexico Mexicans have to live in, Díaz begins, life is &#8220;very hard, very bad,&#8221; a statement he underscores with a statistic: last year, 115 homicides were committed in Nuevo Casas Grandes and its surrounding communities. That works out to a murder rate more than 20 times as high as New York City&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at this juncture that he makes his comment about the dangers of speaking or knowing the truth. I begin inquiring about the February 2008 incident, but Díaz and his younger colleague aren&rsquo;t eager to discuss it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get anywhere, though Díaz casts doubt on Gutiérrez&rsquo;s assertion that the raid was a military operation. All of this talk about human-rights abuses by the army is &#8220;a myth,&#8221; Díaz insists. He is in fact cheered that an army battalion has been making rounds to bolster security in Nuevo Casas Grandes: &#8220;We are abandoned and unprotected here in northwest Chihuahua. It is a very big wish that the soldiers will bring peace. The army is the only group we can trust.&#8221; He adds by way of illustration that several sicarios, as professional assassins are called in Mexico, were arrested and confessed to killing 19 people in town.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The question is, can the army be trusted, and if so, can it win this latest  &mdash;  and biggest  &mdash;  battle in the seemingly endless &#8220;war on drugs&#8221;? Calderón has deployed more than 45,000 troops (out of a total force of 230,000) throughout the country. Of that number, about 7,000, reinforced by 2,300 federal policemen, occupy Juárez as part of Operación Conjunta Chihuahua  &mdash;  the Joint Chihuahuan Operation. The army has taken over all the policing functions. The city is under undeclared martial law.</p>
<p>Although many ordinary Mexicans welcome the army&rsquo;s intervention, certain that things would be far worse without it, approval has been far from universal. Claims of grievous abuses by the armed forces  &mdash;  unlawful detentions, disappearances, thefts, rapes, and murders  &mdash;  have increased sixfold in the past three years, according to Human Rights Watch. One hundred and seventy complaints have been filed in Chihuahua alone, says Gustavo de la Rosa, the former Chihuahua state ombudsman for Mexico&rsquo;s National Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the question of whether militarizing the anti-narcotics campaign is the best way to go about things (a similar strategy in Colombia has been only partially successful), the fact is that, by destroying public trust in the armed forces, military misconduct undermines the entire effort, as I learned from a 50-year-old cleaning woman who now lives in Arizona and who asked to remain anonymous. She was visiting her aunt in Juárez last December when soldiers broke into a neighbor&rsquo;s house, claiming that they were looking for a suspect.</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&rsquo;t say who,&#8221; the woman told me. &#8220;They tore her house apart, took her jewelry and her money, and said that if she complained about what they did they were going to come back and kill her. People are more afraid of the police and soldiers than they are of the narcos, because they&rsquo;re very mean guys  &mdash;  not all, but many.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fear goes beyond undisciplined soldiers running amok. In an interview, de la Rosa told me that the president, elected in 2006 by a margin as thin as an ATM card, called out the army not merely to fight the cartels and eliminate a threat to national sovereignty but to consolidate his power and confer legitimacy on his presidency. &#8220;Calderón wants to show the Congress that the military is with him,&#8221; de la Rosa said. &#8220;And the military promised to support Calderón in exchange for being allowed out of the barracks, because the army wants to govern. Chihuahua is an experiment. What is happening here is in essence a military coup, a regional coup.&#8221; To support this contention, he cited a change he has had to make in his own work. Under normal circumstances, he would file complaints of abuse with the state governor, but now, he said, &#8220;the governor is ineffective, so I have to go to General Felipe de Jesús Espitia, the comandante of the 5th Military District.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was somewhat incredulous that the military was staging a creeping coup. To what end? I asked.</p>
<p>De la Rosa shrugged. &#8220;Actually, nobody really knows or understands what the military is up to,&#8221; he answered, hedging a bit. Then he asserted that the army intends not to stamp out drug trafficking but to &#8220;control&#8221; it. &#8220;So now if a drug cartel wants to move drugs into the U.S., who would they go to? To the governor? No, to the general.&#8221; (El Universal, Mexico&rsquo;s largest newspaper, reported in September that de la Rosa had received death threats from the army, apparently because of his sharp criticisms; sources have told me he has taken temporary refuge in the U.S.)</p>
<p>As de la Rosa suggested, there is a dismal history of collusion between the armed forces and organized crime. In the late 1980s, the Mexican defense secretary was caught peddling protection to three drug organizations, which paid him a total of $10 million. In 1997, Mexico&rsquo;s chief anti-narcotics officer was indicted for providing the Juárez cartel with classified drug-enforcement information in exchange for millions of dollars in bribes. In a 2001 essay in the Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice, a University of Texas criminologist, Patrick O&rsquo;Day, cited several instances of Mexican soldiers&rsquo; guarding narcotics shipments and transporting them into the United States in military vehicles or by other means. These operations were so extensive and went on for so long that O&rsquo;Day concluded that the army was a cartel unto itself.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In seeking, much less speaking, the truth about what the army is up to, one often runs into the paradox of the Mexican reality: something dreadful happens and is then treated as if it hadn&rsquo;t happened. Facts, like people, simply disappear.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The conduct of the Mexican military goes to the heart of U.S. counter-narcotics policy. In the past year, experts like General Barry McCaffrey (the drug czar in the Clinton administration) and political figures have warned that if the cartels are not contained, Mexico could become a failed state and the U.S. could find itself with an Afghanistan or a Pakistan on its southern border. Such forecasts are hyperbole, but the fact is that drug trafficking and its attendant corruption are a malignancy that has spread into Mexico&rsquo;s lymph system. To extend the metaphor, Calderón is attempting to perform radical surgery with the only instrument at his disposal  &mdash;  the army. It may be a tainted instrument, so the reasoning goes, but it is less tainted than the law-enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And that is where U.S. policy becomes contradictory. It calls for a military solution to the trafficking problem. But there are very few, if any, civil safeguards on the actions of the Mexican military. Its soldiers are subject only to military law, even when deployed in their current crime-fighting capacity, and the country&rsquo;s military-justice system is, to understate things, opaque.</p>
<p>{snip} It&rsquo;s pure catch-22: state or federal authorities will not receive complaints against soldiers, and the army will not investigate unless charges have been filed by state or federal authorities.</p>
<p>That is among the reasons why, out of the more than 2,000 complaints brought before Mexico&rsquo;s National Human Rights Commission, not one has resulted in the prosecution of a single soldier.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Every year, under the Foreign Assistance Act, the State Department is required to certify that its southern neighbor is fully cooperating in efforts to stem the export of illegal narcotics into the United States. Without certification, Mexico would be ineligible to receive the vast majority of American aid. But the U.S. government often soft-pedals criticisms of Mexico on matters such as corruption and human-rights offenses, for two reasons. One is U.S. sensitivity to the Mexican elite, which can be thin-skinned about what it regards as infringements from the north on its national sovereignty. The second is money. In the highly unlikely event that Mexico were decertified, the cutoff in U.S. aid would strain bilateral relations, trade agreements would be imperiled, and American businessmen would find it harder to operate south of the border. Also, of all the countries that export oil to the United States, Mexico, at 985,000 barrels a day, ranks third, behind Canada and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>That makes speaking the truth about Mexico politically and economically dangerous in official U.S. circles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.S. government estimates that the cultivation and trafficking of illegal drugs directly employs 450,000 people in Mexico. Unknown numbers of people, possibly in the millions, are indirectly linked to the drug industry, which has revenues estimated to be as high as $25 billion a year, exceeded only by Mexico&rsquo;s annual income from manufacturing and oil exports. Dr. Edgardo Buscaglia, a law professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute in Mexico City and a senior legal and economic adviser to the UN and the World Bank, concluded in a recent report that 17 of Mexico&rsquo;s 31 states have become virtual narco-republics, where organized crime has infiltrated government, the courts, and the police so extensively that there is almost no way they can be cleaned up. The drug gangs have acquired a &#8220;military capacity&#8221; that enables them to confront the army on an almost equal footing.</p>

		<p>Can the US sustain law and order right here when Mexico falls to the cartels, considering the ongoing inner conflict between the races; the possibility of domestic violence; the broad expansion of our military in numerous countries, all on top of the threat of possible war with Iran or North Korea, plus the stepped up activity among jihadists around the world?</p>
<p>I think not.  Never in this country&rsquo;s history has it been so weak internally and militarily with so many threats to contend with all at the same time.</p>
<p>Empire America is falling, like every empire before it, and we will see much evidence of it in 2010.</p>
<p>Greed, a corrupt government and corporations, wanting more power and money, have caused our failure.</p>

		<p>In the Jan 2010 Amren monthly a reference is made to how in WW2 when the Japanese occupied the poppy-growing<br>
regions of Asia, and Turkey sided with<br>
the Axis. <br>
That the hills of Sinaloa State in Mexico, which already had some opium production from early 19th century Chinese immigration(joys of diversity #674,214), had production officially &#8216;ramped up&rsquo; for the U.S. military who needed morphine for its soldiers.</p>
<p>And of course when the need dissipated, the growers (whose fields were then guarded by the Mexican regular Army) were asked to stop said &#8220;um no thanks, as it&rsquo;s too profitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&hellip;Just sharing this for those (who like me a week ago) had never heard of this fascinating little slice of history.</p>

		<p>I heard a psychic on television about twenty years ago say that Mexico was on the brink of economic and political collapse. It didn&rsquo;t require clairvoyance to come to that determination, but we are witnessing the prediction, nonetheless, with many millions fleeing the poverty and violence endemic in Mexican society.<br>
Unfortunately, we too are on the brink of economic collapse because of our seven-decades-long war to rescue civilization, both east and west. Unlike the Mexicans, we have nowhere to run, and even less money to buy a suitcase.</p>

		<p>Mexico has ALREADY fallen to the &#8220;cartels&#8221;.  The situation has shifted over the last few years.  It&rsquo;s no longer a criminal matter, as the people we are talking about are no longer criminals and their organizations are no longer criminal syndicates.</p>
<p>Like it or not, they ARE the government in mexico now, for at least half of that country.  They control all the institutions in their area&hellip;schools, banks, courts, and most importantly, the military.  The people who live there are behind the new government and no longer hold allegiance or obedience to the old one.<br>
This is now a foriegn policy matter.  Our neighbor to the south is no longer a single country but has broken into several smaller countries, many of whom are at war with each other and are de facto rogue states.</p>
<p>How our government interacts with them has to change to reflect the new reality.  Soon these new countries will firm up their positions and entrench themselves.  Expect regions formerly known as parts of mexico to demand to be recognized under new names.</p>

		<p>The legalization of recreational drugs of abuse in the US would do numerous things: </p>
<p>1- Put a lot of third worlders out of very lucrative work and make some of them come up with new &#8220;business plans&#8221;. </p>
<p>2- Potentially cut the payroll of the criminal justice system sector by 70% in the U.S. </p>
<p>3- Set off a two year binge on the part of promiscuous low IQ drug consumers with the concurrent familial destruction and deaths of innocent bystander people. (ie sober DWI accident victims)</p>
<p>4- Provide windfall tax revenue to U.S. coffers via government owned drug stores. </p>
<p>5- Bring about significant reductions in robbery and property crimes in the U.S.</p>
<p>6- Reduce the burden on Social Security and welfare via direct premature drug consumption related deaths; provided that appropriate legislation prohibited drug use related medical expenditures within the socialized sector of U.S. medicine.</p>

<p>Sounds just a little like life in Berkeley and the East Bay, where white girls are raped at school functions, police officers are shot down in the streets   &mdash;   and then insulted by protesting rabble   &mdash;   and the mayor of the biggest city in the region simply refuses to pay his taxes. </p>
<p>Connecting the dots to what has happened to aunts, neighbors, brothers, and others and we have what could almost be described as a slow-motion pogrom. Doing so, however, would be a thought crime. Better to forget. </p>
<p>The few safe places are private schools, private homes, private clubs, and, places of worship. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the line I will not cross: it would be an insult to the profound suffering of the Jews of Europe to call these &#8220;ghettoes&#8221;   &mdash;   after all, the police still work to keep us safe   &mdash;   but there are parallels. </p>
<p>North Berkeley is, however, known as the &#8216;gourmet ghetto.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I believe these oil export revenues are the continuing lifeblood of Mexico&rsquo;s federal government.  It is the only income stream that can compete with the profits made from the drug trade.</p>
<p>Ominously, Mexico&rsquo;s oil production has been declining sharply, having dropped by 20 percent in just the last five years.    Within a few years there may not be enough to even meet domestic demand.  The cartels have also sensed the importance of oil and begun attacking pipelines in certain areas.  Meanwhile, drug violence and H1N1 have hammered tourism revenues.  Mexico is slipping fast.    <br>

		<p>I just worry that so many of those mexicans and salvadorans coming in are bringing that narco culture with them.  I work in a 100% latino school in a major urban area, and let me tell you, there are major gang bangers among the 10th to 12th grades that only come to school to sell their drugs, recruit and do their &#8216;business.&rsquo;  I just keep thinking, &#8220;Why can&rsquo;t we deport those criminals?&rsquo;  If we could keep out all the rotton eggs, I would be less alarmed by hispanic immigration.  But I think that in ten years there may be regions of the U.S. that will be as ungovernable as those parts of mexico.</p>
<p>As it is, there are many places where white americans (and even black ones) cannot go for fear of losing their life or property.</p>

		<p>If we opened up oil drilling off the coast of CA and up in AK, we wouldn&rsquo;t have to even bother with Mexico.  Once that is taken care of, then what we need to do is send in anonymous Marine snipers to take out all the socalled &#8220;elite&#8221; of Mexico, and all of the drug people.  Obviously this couldn&rsquo;t be public knowledge, but it wouldn&rsquo;t have to be.  If it was handled well enough, it&rsquo;d work; of course it&rsquo;d mean we&rsquo;d be doing the work the Mexicans should have done eons ago, but, if we took out all of the blocks to progress, then the Mexicans would have a chance to modernize and become educated, and be a positive force in the world.  Yes, the Marines would have to be fluent in Spanish, but Spanish is one of the easiest languages on earth to learn.  Of course, the Army Rangers and Navy Seals might want to go along as well, and why not; a cooperative effort is always good!</p>

<p>Legalization of drugs would basically destroy the white race utterly.  That&rsquo;s what they were invented to do.</p>
<p>Most of the &#8220;drug syndicates&#8221; in mexico aren&rsquo;t even in it for the money.  They kill anyone in their community who is even suspected of doing drugs.  They know how damaging drugs are and they simply do not allow them&hellip;..in their own communities.</p>
<p>The drugs are a weapon of war to be used against the people they hate&hellip;..us.  Profit isn&rsquo;t the primary motivation.  They would be only too willing to take tiny profits instead of large ones, in the face of legalization, if it meant the amount of drugs in the US multiplied by 10 to 20 times, as the ability to say no to drugs in our communities vanished.</p>
<p>Understand something.  If drugs were legalized, the same people who put Obama in the white house, would make sure that every white child was a strung out meth head, as soon as possible and parents would be punished severely in various ways for trying to stop it (not to mention what would happen to any white community that tried to keep it out).</p>
<p>You want to know what happens when drug are cheap and their sale unimpeded by law?  Examine the history of china with drugs.  They had to basically round up drug addicts and summarily execute them all (two separate times in their history), in order to solve their horrible social problems caused by the western world (actually the jews running the drug trade as they do even today).  Slave labor made drugs cheap to produce and easily affordable by even the poorest chinese.</p>
<p>It nearly wiped them out.  It will do the same to us.</p>

		<p>What we need is a &#8220;Morice Line&#8221; on our southern border.   The Morice and Challe Lines were over 700 miles long,  more than a third of the length of our southern border.   That, along with jailing employers who flagrantly hire illegals,  would allow us to ignore the mess to our south.    Maybe it would force the Mexicans to deal with their problems as well.    Of course, mass immigration is a conscious, hate-motivated  policy of racist genocide against white people and those pushing it have no intention of doing anything to stop it or the problems it brings.   Indeed, they welcome instability in Mexico.   How long will it be before the legal &#8220;refugees&#8221; start arriving?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Dr. Edgardo Buscaglia, a law professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute in Mexico City and a senior legal and economic adviser to the UN and the World Bank, concluded in a recent report that 17 of Mexico&rsquo;s 31 states have become virtual narco-republics&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to know which states those are, but I can&rsquo;t find any links to the report or to discussions of it.</p>
<p>I was in Jalisco  about three years ago and didn&rsquo;t learn of any drug violence there.</p>
<p>I took a bus from Puerto Vallarta to San Diego, and as we got closer to the border, the stops at army checkpoints became more frequent&hellip;we&rsquo;d exit the bus, and soldiers would go through the bus, poking through our carry-on luggage, and at some stops they would also drag out the checked luggage and go through it. I felt like the passengers were less tense than they had been a few years previously when stops and searches were also made at police checkpoints.</p>
<p>At the army checkpoints there would be huge semis parked, and soldiers climbing through the contents in the stifling heat. I was very struck by the total absence of any dogs&hellip;it seemed to me that if the effort were serious, I would have seen some drug-sniffing dogs.</p>
<p>I suspect it&rsquo;s all theatre. That&rsquo;s a statement that has ALWAYS been a fairly accurate statement about Mexico! No matter how deadly the theatre gets.</p>

		<p>Folks, it is a little understood, or known fact, that &#8220;Mexico,&#8221; that large land mass to our south, has rarely existed as a truly unified nation, for all the time since &hellip;well, ever.</p>
<p>The Spanish never got it together. The French didn&rsquo;t. The Mestizos just aren&rsquo;t the type to get ANYTHING together, as their brown, third-world descriprions belie. (Where in the third world, has there been lasting progress, peace or order?) OK, &#8216;nuff said.</p>
<p>At the time the USA went to war with Mexico in the 1840s, Mexico was, and had been for decades, a place on a map. A name. A far-flung population of indians, europeans, mixed-blood types, and some north Americans, that had very little to do with one another. Divided by massive distance. Divided by race. Divided by custom, wealth, social status. <br>
Lacking central government. Patrolled by ever-shifting bands of marauding gangs, small armies, larger armies, bandits, petty tyrants, all fighting eachother in an endless cauldron of gratuitous violence and cruelty, where torture and grisly murder were commonplace.<br>
 The &#8220;people,&#8221; such as they were, generally wanted nothing to do with the deadly fights, and kept away from the soldiers, gangs, self-appointed &#8220;emperors&#8221;, out of fear. <br>
That&rsquo;s the overriding reason why the US seizure of our American West was justified. Above the current border of today&rsquo;s Mexico, the American West was extremely sparsely populated by Mexicans  who wanted to stay as far away from &#8220;Mexico&#8221; as they could. They feared &#8220;Mexico,&#8221; which in real terms, consisted of little more than Mexico City. Beyond that, it was a free-for-all. The government of Mexico effectively ended outside Mexico City, and what existed far to the north was non-existant, or seditious.</p>
<p>Bone up in histories (first-hand accounts) of The days before and during the Mexican-American War. It will enlighten you as to why it was inevitable that the USA snatched the vast lands owned on paper by a petty, squabbling city-state too small for it&rsquo;s britches.  Mexico had about as much real claim to the current US Southwest, as we have to Pluto.  If only Liberals-and Mestizos understood that.<br>
But- isn&rsquo;t it amazing how the past centuries look just like today? <br>
Mexico isn&rsquo;t collapsing. <br>
It has always been a heap of rubble, replete with violence and chaos, division, strife, and elites who rule a mass of ignorant peasants.<br>
Just like today.<br>
Nothing has changed at all.</p>

		<p>Underdog beat me to the punch - I&rsquo;m pro-legalization.  Let&rsquo;s forget prohibition and move on.  Instead of the billions we spend annually to fight the war on drugs lets spend some of that on drug abuse prevention and recovery treatment and let the rest pay for tax cuts.   Maybe then we can also roll back many of the infringements on liberties that have come about due to the war on drugs (e.g. ever tried to move more than $10,000 in cash?).  If we take take the profit out of the illegal drug trade how long before the cartels fall apart?  How long before criminal gangs in the US disintegrate?</p>

		<p>This could all be stopped so quickly and simply. Bring our troops home and line the border, shoulder to shoulder until Mexico and the rest of the corrupt countries who urge their people to break our laws understand that we won&rsquo;t tolerate their dishonoring our laws and breaking in. Then, give the illegals already here thirty days to leave. If caught after that, they&rsquo;ll be put to work building the fence, then deported. Anchor babies go with their border jumping parents. Our immigration laws are not broken, they are just not enforced. One thing we must change, however, is the misinterpreted 14th amendment. No more instant citizenship based on illegally sneaking into this country and having a baby. Then, stop this foolishness of refugee resettlement - we get the dregs of humanity as well as terrorists. Severely reduce legal immigration after a five to ten year moratorium. This is a beginning of taking our country back. There are many, mostly in Congress that could use some attitude adjustment about &#8220;diversity&#8221; and the harm it does to people and countries!</p>

		<p>Speaking of government hypocrisy&hellip; I always wondered why drugs were illegal and gambling wasn`t. In fact, the State sponsors gambling!! Let`s get real here people. The chance for personal and financial devastation is 100X gambling as opposed to drugs. How much marijuana can one smoke in 24 hours? 50 dollars? And cocaine? 250dollars? A thousand? Now contarst that with gambling&hellip; &#8220;I`ll see your seven thousand and raise you ten!!&#8221; Gambling is the only vice where you can lose it all(except your life?) in the space of five minutes. Outlaw gambling, legalize drugs!! </p>

		<p>While legalization is one real-world option to consider, just imagine how easy things would be if Americans (mostly liberals) would only &#8220;do the right thing&#8221;, and forego their selfish drug use, just so that Mexican citizens would no longer be caught in this drug-fueled warfare.  Don&rsquo;t take drugs, as a humanitarian/political statement.  Why haven&rsquo;t the liberals hit upon this already?</p>

&#8220;Legalization of drugs would basically destroy the white race utterly. That&rsquo;s what they were invented to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>I disagree wholeheartedly.  All the most popular drugs were not invented and are naturally grown, with the exception of a few, like amphetamines, which were orginally used as appetite suppressants.  Pilots also took them in WWII in order to stay awake, since they flew so many missions, usually around the clock.</p>
<p>All these arguments in opposition to legalization are not accurate.  Legalizing drugs will take the profit out of them and reduce the drug gang numbers to insignificant levels.</p>
<p>But the argument for and against is a moot point, because the US is going to have to legalize drugs eventually for additional revenue.  And, if they continue trying to stem the illegal flow they will continue to lose, as they have been doing for decades now, and, if they do not, the cartels will take influential control over much of the United States, just as they have done in Mexico.</p>
<p>If the US doesn&rsquo;t legalize drugs, the country is sure to fall several years after Mexico succumbs.</p>

<p>NO WONDER they lie and say 90% of the guns used by the Mexican drug cartels come from the USA. We know that was a lie, but the MSM repeated it like it was sacred gospel.</p>
<p>Actually, most of the cartels&rsquo; guns come from arms bazaars in Latin America, Europe and Asia. This includes military-grade weapons like bazookas, rocket launchers and grenades. They sure didn&rsquo;t get them from &#8220;Father and Son&#8221; Gunshop in Texas.</p>

		<p>Q, it&rsquo;s absurd to claim the criminalization of hard drugs will cause the US to collapse. Increasing our debt, are the 2 main Wars, excessive military bases (especially in Europe; i.e. in case France and Germany go back to war over a soccer match), outsourcing of American jobs to China Japan and the Tropcial countries, the recent bailouts and Healthcare bill, and heavy loans from Asia are bankrupting us. </p>
<p>It is NOT necessary to allow young children or even adults to consume Crystal Meth and Heroin! America will not collapse over their criminalization. If it does, it will be because of the reasons I mentioned.  </p>

		<p>I think one of the mistaken assumptions that those on this thread arguing against legalization and/or decriminalization (they&rsquo;re not the same things) make is that they assume that legalizing means that many more people would do it, and inversely, the reason a lot of people don&rsquo;t do it is because it&rsquo;s illegal.</p>
<p>My contention is that a lot of people, especially young people, do these sorts of drugs because they&rsquo;re illegal   &mdash;   The forbidden fruit syndrome.  I think it would work the other way around   &mdash;   leg/decrim would reduce the usage.</p>
<p>Let me put it to you this way   &mdash;   There are perhaps dozens of legal chemicals that I could shove up my nose, drink, inject in my veins, etc., but I don&rsquo;t do that.  That&rsquo;s because I know they&rsquo;re poison.  Weed and crack are poisons whether they&rsquo;re legal or illegal, and I wouldn&rsquo;t consume them in either circumstance.  Then again, that&rsquo;s just me.</p>

		<p>I would find it easier to accept drug legalization, if they would execute anyone who gave drugs to minors.  Kids are foolish and many will ruin themselves if allowed to.  That&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t treat them like adults.  Without merciless penalties, drug legalization would just loose one more set of predators on our children.  A legal system  that cannot or will not protect the honest, productive members of a society and their families should be replaced by one that will, &#8220;democracy&#8221; be damned.  </p>

<p>Precisely. And in general, I&rsquo;d agree that anyone who wants to destroy his life knowingly should be allowed to do so (with possibly the Chinese solution described by Anon #13 to tidy up the detritus). That&rsquo;s Darwinism in action.</p>
<p>But consider the situation where an illegal (sorry, undocumented) immigrant, looking for a better life, hangs out around schools passing out samples of perfectly legal substances to the kidddies. The appeal now is not just to those who aspire to be criminals; it&rsquo;s to be &#8220;grown-up&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course, you could make it illegal to supply them to minors. I suspect that would be about as effective as it has been with cigarettes and alcohol.</p>
<p>Much simpler to arrest the pusher for possession, than to have to prove he actually gave drugs to children. I know that&rsquo;s far from foolproof, but we have to do something. &#8220;For the children&#8221;.</p>
