<p>A man walked into a Safeway store on Christmas Day in Roseville, California and even though the store was closed and unsupervised, people were shopping inside the store. He called the police. The police found no looting, but small piles of cash left at the registers for purchased items.</p>
<p>Surveillance video showed the Safeway employees locked the main doors at both of the Safeway stores. But customers were able to push the doors open and get in, said Susan Houghton, Safeway spokeswoman. {snip}<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m very surprised.  Even a 1% black population could result in every last item being stolen from the store.</p>
<p>One has to wonder&hellip;.was such attempted and stopped by the white customers?  Probably also on that video tape is a black person taking something without paying and being told by a large group of white men to put it back or the cops would be called.</p>

		<p>Frankly, I can hardly believe the honor system worked in even a town like Roseville!  I promise you it wouldn&rsquo;t work anywhere in SoCA - not even in Claremont, the land of trees &amp; Ph.D.&rsquo;s!  (Yes, I&rsquo;ve got one!)  There are a whole lot of folks today who are desperate and don&rsquo;t know where their next dollar is coming from.  So if they saw free money on the counter, they&rsquo;d consider it an answer to prayer.  I don&rsquo;t like that, but I can&rsquo;t blame them either.  These are tough times.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of when I was a boy and worked upstate NY on farm one summer. Me and the other kid who worked on the farm would go into town in the evening after our chores were done and hang out and talk with the girls and hitchhike back to the farm about ten o&rsquo;clock. One night a couple of guys gave us a ride and on the way out of town they stopped for gas at the gas station that was closed. They pumped their gas and left their money in the overnight box that was outside the front door of the station. </p>
<p>Nary a black person in sight then.</p>

<p>Well, I think the racial makeup of this city says a lot; however, in this day and age it is still a refreshing read, even excluding the racial angle. This society is deteriorating at an almost unfathomable rate it seems. A good number of whites tend to be little better than blacks or Hispanics, when it comes to an absurdly fantasized sense of entitlement. Indeed, not a majority of us, but the Marxist poisoning of both public schooling and popular culture, has worked its rainbow magic on a contemptible minority of white fools. After all, that&rsquo;s how Comrade Obama got elected.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Re # 2 My Dear Flatulentseagull, PHD, nobelese oblige is okay but not with other peoples`s money or morality. To the newly non-affluent did they watch their IRAs closely and switch to money markets after the first 2000 point loss? Did they sell their home at a huge profit, use the proceeds to buy two bigger homes with gigantic mortgages knowing full well they could flip them every two weeks for big bucks? Did they take yearly vacations to Las Vegas or Europe and charge the cost of the trips? Did they not have a six month supply of food, medicine, and ammuntion because they used their money for an upgrade on their second BMW?<br>
     Stealing is wrong and always will be. You are supposed to bwe ready for life`s uncertainties by hoping for the best but expecting the worst.People are always telling reporters that &#8221; I haven`t worked in over a year, what am I to do?&#8221; My question is why haven`t you starved to death six months ago if things are so bad for your family?<br>

		<p>Poeple quietly and peacefully stroll up and down the aisles, select what they need, and leave the money for their purchase at the cash register, even there are no employees minding the store. No one vandalizes the place or steals the stock or the money left by previous shoppers. That is because the majority of white people are inherently civilized. They know right from wrong and will abide by the principles of white behavior even if no one is watching. You can bet your bottom dollar this would not have been the outcome of a store accidentally left unsecured in New Orleans, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia&hellip; any other  city with a sizable non-white population. In the 1950&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s this would have been such a common occurance as to be considered non news. With the darkening of America it has become a rarity, and that is sad indeed. </p>

		<p>I attended a Catholic High School in Philly during the 60s. It was a block from a newstand located right at the entrance steps to one of the Market- Frankford EL stations.  The owner would go on break and leave the stand unattended. He left a cigar box on the counter of the stand for the people to leave money for newspapers or magazines. In the box was a small statue of The Virgin Mary. We used to observe people going to the box and depositing their money before taking their item of choice. I never once saw anyone take anything without paying for it. The neighborhood included the Juniata/ Frankford sections of the city; both of which were predominantly White Catholic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting that there are no dishonest Whites but perhaps back in that era there was a greater sense of personal honor.<br>
Back in the North Philadelphia of the same period, the box, the money and the Statue wouldn&rsquo;t have lasted 5 minutes.</p>

		<p>Obviously, I can&rsquo;t comment on how much, if any, money the store lost during this apparently inadvertent display of remarkable trust.</p>
<p>As an interesting aside to this story, as an eastern Pennsylvanian I often have occasion to shop Amish farms stands in the summers.  These are not infrequently unmanned and run on a self-serve basis, with customers expected to pick and tally their produce and slip the appropriate cash amount through a slot in the door.</p>
<p>Obviously, the Amish country in general is not exactly a high-crime area, though I&rsquo;m sure the occasional ne&rsquo;er-do-well clips the farmers for a few tomatoes and cucumbers, but not often enough to make them discontinue the practice.</p>
<p>The simple fact is that crime is highly localized in this country and most prevalent in those urban areas with large minority populations.</p>

		<p>Here in Michigan there was a power outage that affected the entire business district in the small town (name withheld) where I patronize.  Most businesses stayed open despite the power problem.  The local hardware store issued flashlights to customers to enable them to shop.  Upon questioning, the owner remarked that there was no looting or shoplifting; everything purchased had been paid for without incident.<br>
Another incident  &mdash;  purchasing farm supplies from a local business I have never done business with before, I had forgotten to bring cash or my checkbook.  The owner had me take the supplies and requested that I drop off the money later.  This incident happened recently and is indicative of the trust many rural people have of their &#8220;fellow man&#8221;.  Cultural inclusiveness was at work here.  <br>
Yes, it is still possible to have trust between humans of like cultural commonality.</p>

		<p>I have to admit there have been several times I have been in a position to be dishonest and not pay for something or take something that wasn&rsquo;t mine but did not . Judeo-Christian home training and racial pride have been the key. Blacks have no honor or pride.</p>

		<p>I live in a rural part of England and honour boxes outside small farm shops are quite common, several local grocery stores runa tab system. No credit vetting you sign for your goods and settle at the end of the month. Its a white thing I think.</p>

		<p>I can recall from the 1950&rsquo;s one of my daily chores was to go to the local drug store and buy the evening paper. Would walk in the store, get the paper and put the exact change on the counter. Before doing so, would raise my hand so the pharmacist at the back could see me, and then and walk out the door. The guy never once ran to the front of the store, or said wait, or anything like that. I guess for a paper, he felt the amount was so small, there was no problem. But too, he trusted folks and his trust was not ill placed.</p>
<p>Did this store still have the lights on when the employees left for the day?</p>

		<p>I operated a small pizza place in a small semi rural town&hellip; the students would get their own sodas from the fountain, I would hand them the slices and they would make their own change on the counter. This progressed to the dinner crowd and even the tourists&hellip; only rarely did I perceive sinister intentions and then focus in or make the change myself. I know this was borderline folly but it was practicle .. as I could keep costs down and work alone. Also it was interesting for all concerned to see that ..as I see it, human nature is good (when raised right) and recognises the bigger picture in that individuality requires individual dignity. People would come from the city and be amazed. As to would black people behave this honorably&hellip; I think yes&hellip; IF they hadn&rsquo;t been raised to think their difficult circumstances in life were due to what (others..usually whites) did to them. The idea that people are owed something is a diseased idea as I see it. The universe doesn&rsquo;t exhault this group or crush that group nor put this group into anothers hand&hellip;people reap what they and their ancestors have sown from my perspective. </p>

		<p>I realize the topic here is honesty, however, it would make more sense to leave a signed IOU for the amount you owe.  No one would be tempted to steal that, &amp; the owner would know which items have been taken.  You can pay him back tomorrow or next week.  Just leaving random cash on the counter isn&rsquo;t going to help him keep track of his inventory.  </p>

		<p>Great post Petrarch.  I enjoyed reading all of the above posts, they really made my day. Taurus said it all:  personal honor is the key. </p>
<p>Even throughout California, one can stumble into all-white small rural towns where items are paid for on the honor system.  We recently stopped by a yard sale on the Monday of a 3-day weekend; there were just a few things left, and the sign posted said &#8220;Please place money in the box by the front door&#8221;.  We found a fan we liked, and when we went to pay, that box was stuffed with cash.  But we didn&rsquo;t worry anyone would take it.</p>
<p>It was a good teaching moment for our kids (it would still be stealing and WRONG even though you probably wouldn&rsquo;t get caught).</p>
<p>My new favorite expression:  It&rsquo;s a white thing&hellip;..</p>

		<p>One of the best educations I got, as a teenager, was working as a parking attendant in the inner-city. A little dangerous to work in a cash-based business in that area, but also real interesting. How people behave with small sums of cash is telling.  </p>

		<p>To Taurus #8</p>
<p>I grew up in a working class Catholic neighborhood in Boston in the 60s and early 70s. In those days Catholic churches were open 24 hours a day so that the faithful could come in and pray at any hour of the night. Despite the abundance of gold on the altar no one ever stole anything, nor was there any vandalism reported  &mdash;  not ever!<br>
Nowadays churches are locked up tight, and most have cameras and alarms to deter theives.<br>
The good ole days are gone forever, I&rsquo;m afraid. </p>

		<p>All good comments. We should be very proud of our American White heritage. No other group can duplicate such womderful behavior. This is one reason why when the settling of scores comes with the minorities, we won&rsquo;t annihilate them like all other groups in the world would do. We will do what has to be done, and then after the dirty work is done, we&rsquo;ll do the right thing by the vanquished. The overall honor and kindness of White Americans is what astonishes the rest of the world.</p>

		<p>Back in the late 1960&rsquo;s, my dad had a friend who owned a small convenience store that at one time was a neighborhood grocery. A fair amount of his sales came from the middle school across the street. When court ordered busing brought in an influx of minorities, this store owner quickly discovered the hazards to his business. I&rsquo;m sure that the white students occasionally stole a candy bar or soda, but within the first week of life after busing, the owner discovered about $350 (in 1969 dollars) worth of &#8220;shrinkage&#8221;. To deal with this, the owner reverted to a system where he placed a counter up front and hired a stock boy to run throughout the store to gather requested items. You had to be over 18 to go behind the counter. Of course, he was accused of being &#8220;rayciss&#8221; for trying to keep his business from being looted to death. </p>
<p>As you can imagine, the parents in this neighborhood quickly started relocating to districts that were not as affected by busing. By the mid 1970&rsquo;s, this man closed up shop and the neighborhood turned. Find me an example of the honor system working at a mom and pop grocery in a black neighborhood.  </p>

Taurus, I dont remember Frankford being all that white ever, but I do remember Juniata back in the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s&hellip;.English is now a secondary language there, if at all&hellip;Your Alma Mater North Catholic is slated to close shortly as well as Cardinal Dougherty in Olny&hellip; I guess there&rsquo;s just not enough Whites left to keep it going&hellip;Sad state of affairs here in Philly&hellip;</p>
<p>Reaper,<br>
Actually I attended NC in the late fifties to early sixties and when Frankford was predominantly White except for a section on the east side of Frankford Avenue.  There were two Catholic parishes: St. Joachim which was mostly Irish on the West side and Mater Dolorosa which was Italian.  The latter has since closed or at least the school has and St. Joachim is barely hanging on.<br>
There is a movement to establish NC as a Cristo Rey school which would be operated privately through grants and will no longer have any ties to the Archdiocese of Phila. They&rsquo;ve formed a committee to determine whether the demographics meet the criteria for approval by Cristo Rey. I believe that the Cristo Rey concept began in Chicago and is intended for students who are economically disadvantaged. The name would indicate some ties with an Hispanic organization.<br>
As for Cardinal Dougherty, I don&rsquo;t hold out much hope for its survival. <br>
I grew up in North Philly not far from the former Connnie Mack Stadium AKA Shibe Park. I once had a nostalgia driven desire to ride through the old neighborhood but I souldn&rsquo;t find an agency that rented APCs. Center City is still rather nice but it&rsquo;s kind of a Potemkin Village. Don&rsquo;t go more than ten blocks in any direction, that is unless you&rsquo;re heavily armed and armored.</p>

To Taurus #8</p>
<p>I grew up in a working class Catholic neighborhood in Boston in the 60s and early 70s. In those days Catholic churches were open 24 hours a day so that the faithful could come in and pray at any hour of the night. Despite the abundance of gold on the altar no one ever stole anything, nor was there any vandalism reported &mdash; not ever!<br>
Nowadays churches are locked up tight, and most have cameras and alarms to deter theives.<br>
The good ole days are gone forever, I&rsquo;m afraid. </p>
<p>Roger,<br>
On my first trip to Boston in the 80s, I liked it right away. It seemed to have everything that I used to like about Philly and then some. I was under the impression that the &#8220;dicey&#8221; area was restricted to Roxbury. On my most recent trip I noticed the &#8220;change&#8221;. Ditto re. &#8220;The good ole days&#8221;. The &#8220;Melanoma&#8221; spreads quickly. <br>

<p>You still do find these stores in the black areas of Chi. Almost exclusively run by an Arab couple or a Korean. And quite often the place resembles a fortress with cameras, the bullet proof glass in front of the counter, etc.</p>
<p>And quite sadly, often these ma&rsquo; and pa&rsquo; couples are found shot dead one day, the reasoning being: &#8220;they refused to give credit to someone&#8221;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Ad hoc &ldquo;honor system&rdquo; probably wouldn&rsquo;t have worked in Watts or East LA.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t work in any upscale neighborhood either if it had a large percentage of blacks.  You know, the ones who are given high paying jobs, aceing out a qualified white, but who just love &#8220;sticking it to the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>They call those kinds of thefts &#8220;paybacks&#8221; for 400 years of suffering.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re stumped as to how privileged blacks today have ever suffered, don&rsquo;t worry, only the lame brained, white lefties would know that.  It would make perfect sense to Chris Matthews, Nancy Pelosi or Richard Durbin, et al, and, of course, our chief community organizer. He wants to right all the injustices against blacks, like giving them freebies and affirmative action.</p>
<p>Neither he nor his wife could EVER achieve much on their own without special giveaways and privileges, especially his wife, but, don&rsquo;t worry, if they weren&rsquo;t the recipients of so much it, it would all be because of oppression and discrimination.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not only ingrates and white-haters, they&rsquo;re so arrogant they think they could do it all on their own.</p>
<p>Disgusting.<br>

		<p>please pardon lack of cap&rsquo;s d/t broken keyboard.</p>
<p>around 15 years ago, an article in &#8221;u.s.a. today&#8221; newspaper came out a chart of 15 or 20 or so of our most populous cities and with the percentages of racial minorities. during this time in the mid-1990&rsquo;s i was beginning to put 2-and-2 together connecting the high corrolations of crime and minority populations and considering a move from my home in shreveport, la. d/t high crime&hellip;.in shreveport, no doubt directly related to its high black population. 4 years ago, it tipped over to 51 percent and predictably, they elected their first black mayor.</p>
<p>in every instance, my impressions were right in that the most desirable cities were those with the smallest minority populations. in texas, for instance, although most of the cities had high mestizo populations, the most desirable city in terms of low crime and &#8221;good&#8221; schools was austin. i don&rsquo;t know if their figures were accurate, but they listed austin as 80 percent white. no surprise there. i&rsquo;m certain it&rsquo;s much more than that now with our southwest border wide open and with the welcoming, liberal population of whites there. not to mention the overall wealth of the city and job opportunities.</p>
<p>just a few thoughts on minority populations and prevalence of crime. probably not what most every reader of amren doesn&rsquo;t know already, but some info i thought i&rsquo;d add on my awakening and close corrolation with crime  </p>

<p><br>
You&rsquo;re the only one who picked up on this point&hellip; and you&rsquo;re absolutely right. You have no business being in a store that is closed! No matter how honest your intentions, you&rsquo;d be trespassing and would be subject to arrest. </p>
<p>Unless there&rsquo;s a sign on the door clearly stating, &#8220;Everyone come in and help yourselves;  just leave your money on the counter&#8221;, then you have no right to be in that store, and no alibi if you&rsquo;re caught. Being there is trespassing, and taking something is burglary.  Period!</p>

		<p>John PM, your statement about some whites feeling an absurd sense of entitlement was spot on. I have met these kinds of buffoons at various times in my adult life. My God, they would feel affronted if they had to chop their own wood at a cabin in the mountains that a friend allowed them to use. There are better examples, but you make a profound point. I&rsquo;ve found these clowns, almost without exception, to be liberal Democrats. They sure are one of the main reasons this nation is deteriorating at the rate you mention. </p>
