<h1><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-12-01-indian-christian_N.htm">N.Y. Protestant Churches Apologize to Native Americans</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Burke, USA Today, December 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Four hundred years after their spiritual ancestors took part in the decimation and dislocation of Native Americans in New York, one of the nation&rsquo;s first Protestant churches held a &#8220;healing ceremony&#8221; to apologize.</p>
<p>&#8220;We consumed your resources, dehumanized your people, and disregarded your culture, along with your dreams, hopes and great love of this land,&#8221; representatives from Collegiate Church said in a statement. &#8220;With pain, we the Collegiate Church, remember our part in these events.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Friday ceremony took place on Native American Heritage Day in lower Manhattan, where in 1628 Dutch colonizers built the first Collegiate Church, then known as the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church, at Fort Amsterdam. The Dutch West Indies Company treated Native Americans &#8220;as a resource,&#8221; Collegiate said in a statement, and &#8220;we were the conscience of this company.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ron Holloway, who attended the ceremony as a representative of the Lenape people, said {snip} he and other Lenape people &#8220;whole-heartedly accept this apology.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Friday&rsquo;s ceremony, Holloway embraced leaders from Collegiate, according to the Associated Press, and exchanged wampum, strings of beads symbolizing money or ornaments.</p>

		<p>Apologizing for things that no one alive today committed will only add fuel to the American Indians&rsquo; anti-white grudge.</p>
<p>As I said, no one alive today participated in the genocide of the American Indians, so it&rsquo;s pointless to apologize.</p>
<p>Speaking of apologies for past misdeeds, where is the apology from the Arab-Berbers for enslaving 1.25 million Europeans? It only seems like whites are caring enough to apologize for things they shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>This one-sided teeth-gnashing &amp; garment-rending does get a bit tiresome after a while.</p>
<p>The Indians &amp; the Dutch were both human, equally capable of the full range of human actions when confronted with the opportunity for power &amp; material gain.</p>
<p>Both sides considered the other as a &#8220;resource&#8221;, one had beaver pelts to trade, the other various manufactured items, and alcohol, as well.</p>
<p>The Indians never passed up an opportunity to &#8220;dehumanize&#8221; the Europeans when the chance arose. One could argue that the Dutch were limited by their company&rsquo;s Christian &#8220;conscience&#8221; in how far they could go in dealings with the Indians, whereas the Indians, having no religious philosophies counseling restraint &amp; mercy, had no qualms about subjecting their enemies to the most horrible tortures should the opportunity present itself.</p>
<p>The Indians&rsquo; &#8220;great love of this land&#8221; didn&rsquo;t stop them from decimating the beaver population in their zeal for profit and gain. Nor did any &#8220;great love of this land&#8221; prevent their distant ancestors from exterminating into extinction the Ice-Age megafauna. The ground sloths, the saber-tooth tigers, and the mastodons would disagree that the Indians were respectful stewards of nature&rsquo;s bounty.</p>
<p>And where did this urge to apologize for events someone else did, in some other time, come from? </p>
<p>As one partially descended from 1620&rsquo;s Dutch settlers in the Hudson valley, in honor of their memory I issue this proclamation:</p>
<p>&#8220;I hereby announce that my ancestors are entirely exempt from any and all apologies anyone in this present shall feel the inexplicable need to emote, for any reason whatsoever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mike NY ;)</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;d avise the weepy reverends to look closely at the exchanged wampum, as &#8220;Though the Indians sometimes accepted shoddy trade goods, they consistently refused to take, in exchange for furs, any but the best quality sewant [wampum]. Therefore, the poorer product was fobbed off on the Dutch settlers&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>So they are apologizing for something that happened in the 1600s?  This is ridiculous.  What&rsquo;s next, are the English and French going to apologize to the Germans for war crimes committed during the Thirty Years&rsquo; War?</p>

		<p>I sure am glad we&rsquo;ve got that behind us. Now there shouldn&rsquo;t be any need to revisit this topic, right? Only somehow I think this topic will be revisited. And next time the demands will be for cold hard cash instead of the &#8220;strings of beads symbolizing money.&#8221; An apology is always the beginning of a shakedown racket.</p>

		<p>NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS should never apologize. Collective White guilt trips are a form of collective punishment designed to have NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS to internalize their own oppression. The internalization of ones own oppression is one of the worst forms of oppression&hellip;there is a direct road from this to complete race-replacement at the hands of post-1965 hispanics,asians,muslims and africans.</p>
<p>For thousands of years Ameridians engages in genocides,conquests and enslavement. Now it was done in an Ameridian context..but why should that make it tolerable and acceptable. After all, as &#8220;American&#8221; left-what is Alexaneder Cockburn doing in OUR AMERICA-race should be not be a factor in anything. OK, the Ameridians were genocidal maniacs. </p>
<p>I do not care about blacks and &#8220;NATIVE AMERICANS&#8221;&hellip;anymore than they care about NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS.</p>
<p>I am not in favor of treating Ameridians in modern day America badly by the way. However, you know what you can do with the white guilt trip.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m another New Yorker. Okay, it&rsquo;s not mentioned that the Iroquois and colonists lived in close proximity for almost two centuries-1620s - 1790s. The Iroquois were finally driven west after they made a bad foreign policy decision and supported the Loyalists during the War for Independence. They had White loyalist allies the fought in the Mohawk Valley and around Niagara. The settlers living in small communities along the Mohawk river were a mix of German, English, and Dutch. When the Iroquois went on a rampage they descended on these colonists to scalp and burn. When the war turned against them the Indians were driven west and their Loyalist allies exiled to Canada. Prior to this, in  the 1750s, the Iroquois and the British were allied against the French, Huron, and Algonkian during the Seven Years War. So the situation is far more complex than &#8216;genocide&rsquo;. I say to the apologizers-&#8220;Next time, do a little research.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Who do these people think they are fooling anyway? If we were truely sorry for the way our ancestors treated the native people we would give back the land and all move back to Europe. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sorry at all for what happened. I have ancestors that were both native and white and they killed each other and they married each other.  The strong and the smart survived and the weak perished. That&rsquo;s just how it has worked since the beginning of time. </p>
<p>The natives were at least smart enough to understand the fact that no one owns land.  If you are strong enough then you can hold onto it for a time until someone stronger comes along and then it&rsquo;s their land. The native didn&rsquo;t even claim to have a magical deed from God to the land, they had taken it from weaker tribes and knew how the system works.</p>
<p>If we are not carefull our claim to this land will soon be over and those with more brains and less restraint will take possession of it.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was Protestants that did all that, for one thing.</p>
<p>For another, I&rsquo;m part Native and I really couldn&rsquo;t care less what one set of ancestors did to another.  It&rsquo;s all in the past.  </p>
<p>For all I know, my husband&rsquo;s Irish ancestors might have been killing my English ancestors.  Do we care?  Nope.</p>

		<p>Read Mark Twain&rsquo;s essay on the &#8220;American&#8221; Indian. You won&rsquo;t be dissapointed.</p>
<p>I shed no tears for the &#8220;Native American&#8221;. That nonsense is for emasculated sissy White liberals. <br>

		<p>Whites: the only race of people who apologize for winning wars.</p>
<p>Every time I hear a snivelling white liberal or black militant whine that America was &#8220;stolen&#8221; from the natives I ask why they don&rsquo;t move to another continent rather than live on stolen property.  </p>

		<p>Cheap apologies convince no one. White Christians and White liberals racked with guilt over the treatment of Amerindians must prove their apologies are sincere by giving all their family wealth to amerindians and returning to Europe.</p>

		<p>The Indians in the vicinity of Manhattan and along the Lower Hudson valley were ancient enemies of the fierce and warlike Mohawks living further to the north, around modern Albany. A historical fact is that the Mohawks swooped down on the lower Hudson and massacred most of the weaker tribes living there, leaving only scattered survivors. Are the Mohawks going to grovel and apologize?  I doubt it!</p>
<p>Incidentally, the Indians around New Amsterdam were plenty warlike enough, even before the Mohawks finally polished them off. They gladly massacred what Dutchmen they could get their hands on. That is why the Dutch built the wall where Wall Street now stands   &mdash;   to fend off Indian attacks, even AFTER the Indians had sold them the island and then changed their minds again.</p>

		<p>Mike NY, regarding your proclamation, I will respond with one of my own:</p>
<p>I, a descendant of various Indian &#8216;Princesses&rsquo; who married Jews and Scotsmen (and one Polish &#8216;prince&rsquo;), hereby absolve you of any guilt which could foolishly be construed to have derived from your involvement in the Dutch colonization of New York (It&rsquo;s not your fault.  You didn&rsquo;t know any better, as you were still three and one-half centuries away from having been born).  And on behalf of Native Americans everywhere, I would like to thank you for the lovely beads.</p>
<p>But could you do a little something for me in return?  I crave absolution for having exterminated the Ground Sloth.  I swear I didn&rsquo;t know it was the last one.</p>
<p>I, too, am tired of weepy little loser Clergymen attempting to impose a bizarre collection of ancient Middle-Eastern and Neo-Marxist ideas upon congregations who only want someplace nice to have weddings and funerals.  Is it too much to ask?  &hellip;just someplace to sit, all dressed-up, and listen to organ music, without some little loser in the pulpit trying to inject &#8216;meaning&rsquo; and &#8216;purpose&rsquo; and &#8216;diversity&rsquo; into my life?</p>
<p>And they wonder why the pews are empty.  Congregations want beauty, not &#8216;relevance&rsquo;.  </p>
