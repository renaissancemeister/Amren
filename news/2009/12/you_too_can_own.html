<h1>You, Too, Can Own a $100 Trillion Note  &mdash;  From Zimbabwe</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amanda Hamon, Journal and Courier (West Lafayette, Indiana), December 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Store owner Randy Ramsey said he recently bought 60 Zimbabwean $100 trillion notes  &mdash;  complete with colorful artwork  &mdash;  to add to the store&rsquo;s wide collection of foreign and out-of-circulation currency.</p>
<p>The notes were available for purchase Tuesday, at $10 a bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had bought this as a novelty piece, and to show what inflation does,&#8221; said floor manager Chad Ramsey. &#8220;A hundred trillion is a really hard number to comprehend.&#8221;</p>
<p>The notes have been out of circulation in their African home country since June, Chad Ramsey said.</p>
<p>Before then, they were worth about 33 cents American.</p>
<p>In Zimbabwe, $100 trillion is about enough to buy three eggs, said sales associate Zach Briggs, who researched the currency.</p>
<p>The outrageous inflation suggested in that scenario makes the notes a lesson in economics, store workers said. Zimbabwe is home to one of the worst hyperinflation crises in the world thanks to an economy flushed with printed currency.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The $100 trillion notes are the third version of that Zimbabwean denomination, the Ramseys said.</p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s current $100 trillion bill was reprinted in June to eliminate some of its dizzying zeroes.</p>

<p>Now, they finally admit that inflation is a monetary, and not an economic, phenomenon. </p>

		<p>To show you how bad things are there&hellip; I had both the 50 and 100 Billion dollar note. This neighbor was cajoling me to give them to her for her husband at Christmas. By the time I went online 3 days later they were already selling the 100 Trillion dollar note. The &#8220;Shock Value&#8221; I found to be non existent. Every convinece store clerk or waitress I dropped it on thought it was just play money. Then I told them it was &#8220;that Zimbabwe inflation money&#8221;. Nobody knew what Zimbabwe or inflation was&hellip; But that`s anther post.</p>

		<p>This reminds me, and not in a way that makes me laugh, of the &#8220;What Comes After &#8216;Trillion&rsquo;?&#8221; Obama tee shirt.</p>
<p>Maybe African presidents get a feeling of accomplishment from working with really big numbers.  &#8220;President Oingo Boingo of Dumbwebwe today announced ground-breaking for the country&rsquo;s new seventy-nine-NONILLION-dollar goat-dip facility.&#8221;</p>
<p>This should be funny.  But considering that, thanks to a certain Kenyan prodigy, we will soon be facing hyperinflation or currency devaluation (or one, following the other&hellip;), I can&rsquo;t laugh.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s coming sooner than we think.  I read on John Lott&rsquo;s blog today that Barney Frank&rsquo;s proposed TARP II legislation would mean that the Federal government guarantee four terabucks in future bailout funds.  (I think it&rsquo;s all a runup for more subprime affirmative action mortgages.)  Add to that Obama&rsquo;s other spending, and we better not laugh at Zimbabwe.  Just for reference:  After trillion, it&rsquo;s quadrillion, then quintillion.</p>

		<p>We should keep in mind that the trillion dollar note is not exclusively an African phenomenon.  The Weimar Republic managed substantially the same feat in the years following WW I.</p>
<p>There is no reason that it can&rsquo;t happen here, given that the dollar is now a purely fiat currency of no inherent or redeemable value.</p>
<p>The irony of the whole ugly situation is that we have a socialist son of Africa in the White House along with a congress staffed almost entirely by somewhat humanoid simians, few of whom have ever even held a real job.</p>

		<p>This is a topical joke about the situation in Zimabawe but it is definitely non-PC.</p>
<p>A black Zimbabwean couple are sitting in their home in the city waiting to die. There has been no work for months, inflation is running at 1.250 000 percent, they haven&rsquo;t eaten a decent meal in weeks, and the water and power haven&rsquo;t worked in years.     So they sit huddled under blankets waiting for the end when suddenly they hear the water pipes begin to rumble and eventually water starts pouring out of the long unused taps. Next the electric light begins to flicker and then fill the apartment with bright light.   In the street outside a large new truck arrives with food being handed out from the back. </p>
<p>The husband looks at his wife and says, <br>
&#8220;QUICK WOMAN, BRING ME MY PANGA (MACHETE/big knife). </p>
<p>THE WHITES ARE BACK!&#8221;<br>

		<p>I would advise them to switch to monopoly money. No seriously, monopoly money can only be obtained by buying a board game sold by the Parker brothers corporation retailing at about $20.00, thus pegging it to the dollar and giving it some tangible measure of value unlike Afro play money which is based on nothing! <br>

		<p>And for what reason do these folks in Africa need money anyhow? Prior to whitey entering the area, they did not HAVE or NEED money as we understand it, and yet they seemed to get along pretty well. So just do away with money and go back to the old way. Barter and such.</p>

		<p>Back in the &rsquo;70s when Idi Amin was in power one of his ministers complained that Uganda&rsquo;s dollars were useless. Amin shrugged and said &#8220;Then just print more money.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Austrian school of economics (F.W. Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, Murray Rothbard, Ron Paul) have tried for decades to explain that inflation is mostly caused by governments printing too much money in general circulation.  </p>

<p>Ahmed Sekou Toure, the late dictator of Guinea, used to say:</p>

<p>Judging by the way he ran Guinea, there was plenty of poverty, but NO freedom, as well, of course.</p>

<p><br>
The recent late Stokley Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Toure in part to honor Toure. Stokley the U.S. black militant [black power], while living for decades in Guinea, totally missed or glossed over and ignored the torture, the repression, the ideological sameness, the communist leaning Toure practiced and espoused. And of course, as you might expect, Ahmed did NOT live in poverty and did NOT lack for anything. And neither did Stokley. &#8220;I want those Cadillacs too&#8221;, says Stokley.</p>

<p>As history would have it, in the late 60s in Saigon&hellip;there was what was called MPC being used as money and some enterprising G.I.s got away with buying lots of stuff and services using monopoly money.  The Vietnamese then tried to cash the stuff in for real money&hellip;lots of wild stuff happens in combat areas! Like I have said, civilization and civil conduct is a very thin veneer on a human being.</p>

		<p>Correct, John.  The hyperinflation in Weimar Germany was grotesque.  I have old Weimar postage stamps, and on of them was originally printed at a &#8220;50 Millionen&#8221; (50 million) Mark denomination, but was re-stamped before it could be issued as &#8220;5 Milliard&#8221; (5 billion).  Keep in mind when thinking about this that a European billion is not the 1000 million used in the United States, but instead is one million million, so under US numerology, this postage stamp is 5 times ten-to-the-twelth Marks, or what we would call 5 trillion.</p>
<p>The reason for the runaway inflation in Germany after world war one was that the victorious allies demanded Germany pay the entire cost of the war.  Germany was just as bankrupt as the rest of the parties to the conflict were, and so paid by simply printing worthless money.  I do not know whether German currency was backed at the time by their government&rsquo;s holdings of precious metals, or whether - like today&rsquo;s US dollar - it was simply backed by the value of the German economy (all the goods and services produced in Germany each year), but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.  Printing more banknotes simply dilutes the value of what is already in circulation (and is effectively an invisible form of taxation, as governments, by printing this money, are stealing some of the value of privately-held cash and bank deposits.)</p>
