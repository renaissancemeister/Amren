<h1>SCLC Suspends Chairman and Treasurer</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ernie Suggs, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, December 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Weeks before installing a new King as the leader of the SCLC, the organization suspended its chairman and treasurer.</p>
<p>In a overnight emailed press release, dated Monday, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference said that its controversial board chairman, the Rev. Raleigh Trammell, and treasurer, Spiver Gordon, were  suspended pending &#8220;an internal investigation into alleged claims of improprieties.&#8221;</p>
<p>This fall, the SCLC elected Bernice King vote as the organization&rsquo;s first female president. King is the youngest daughter of SCLC co-founder the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>She is to be installed into the position early next year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We are at a historical moment in history as we prepare to ratify the election of Rev. Dr. Bernice A. King as the organization&rsquo;s first female president,&#8221; Tucker [the Rev. Sylvia Tucker, SCLC&rsquo;s acting board chairman] said. &#8220;It is incumbent upon us to protect the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the SCLC as we work to ensure that necessary steps are taken [to] guarantee the public trust in the organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;During my tenure as chairperson, I will work with the board of directors to instill a firm commitment to transparency and accountability,&#8221; Tucker said.<br>

		<p>The SCLC is more irrelevant than the Flat Earth Society. This is an organization that has accomplished absolutely nothing of note in the last four decades.</p>
<p>Apparently they must still be taking in some $ or they would have already folded their tent and moved on to a new scam.  </p>

<p>Which legacy might that be? Plagiarism and doing drugs with prostitutes at the Lorraine Motel?</p>

		<p>Living in Alabama, I am very familiar with Spiver Gordon and his criminal activities. This guy is little more than a street thug. Gordon is part of the group that bankrupted Greene County, Alabama. County books were in such bad shape, State investigators could not audit their financial records. Literally hundreds of county checks bounced. Companies such as mine that provided professional engineering services would not do business with Greene County until fees were placed in an escrow account in advance before ANY work began.</p>
<p>The idea that Spiver Gordon was the treasurer of any organization makes me laugh out loud! In the past Gordon was tried for voter fraud and child molestation! Plus when the so-called &#8220;church arsons&#8221; occurred in the Alabama black belt, he was right in the middle of it. There may or may not have been matches in his hand but there was certainly MONEY! Plus all the attention from his voter fraud case was diverted by the church fires. This guy belongs in prison, but the SCLC makes him their treasurer! What a JOKE!</p>
<p>Do a web search for Spiver Gordon and Greene County to learn more about his activities.</p>

		<p>Spiver Gordon was convicted of voter fraud in federal court and was later tried for sexual abuse of a minor female. The SCLC can sure pick&rsquo;em!</p>
<p>By the way, the votes he stole were all from black citizens and the little girl he was charge with abusing was black too.</p>

		<p>The reporter, if they had been more enterprising, could have uncovered a long history of malfeasance and financial hijinks within the SCLC. I believe the main point they are trying to make is that the SCLC is cleaning house so that no dirt sticks to Ms. King. To the degree to which these purges help bolster a squeakly clean image for Bernice, the better it is for the SCLC. </p>

		<p>Show me a black-run organization, be it country, state, city, or club - that ISN&rsquo;T full of corruption, thievery, graft, and total greed!  It doesn&rsquo;t exist, friends.  This is the norm, not the exception.</p>
