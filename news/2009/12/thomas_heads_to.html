<h1>Thomas Heads to Nashville After Getting Life Without Parole</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamie Satterfield, Knoxville News Sentinel, December 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There were no celebrations Thursday as a Hamilton County jury announced the fate of convicted killer George Thomas.</p>
<p>Instead, an air of resignation and regret-tinged relief hung in Knox County Criminal Court as the jury foreman declared the panel&rsquo;s decision to spare the life of Thomas, 26, but order him to stay forever behind bars.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&rsquo;t help but be greedy,&#8221; Christian&rsquo;s mother, Deena Christian, said of the families&rsquo; disappointment that, so far, only convicted ringleader Lemaricus Davidson has rated a death sentence for a fatal January 2007 crime spree.</p>
<p>After the verdict, authorities transported Thomas to the Charles Bass Correctional Complex in Nashville, said Dorinda Carter, spokeswoman for the Tennessee Department of Correction. Bass is an intake center for new inmates, where Thomas will be evaluated perhaps over 30 to 60 days to decide where he should serve out his life sentence, Carter said.</p>
<p>Like Thomas, Davidson&rsquo;s brother, Letalvis Cobbins, also has been sentenced to life without parole.</p>
<p>A fourth defendant, Vanessa Coleman, faces trial in May. A fifth suspect, Eric Boyd, is serving an 18-year prison term for hiding out Davidson after the slayings, but he remains uncharged in the couple&rsquo;s deaths.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chris Newsom&rsquo;s mother noted Thursday that Cobbins, who has remained close friends with Thomas while the pair were jailed pending trial, claimed Thomas accompanied Davidson and Boyd when her son was being led to his execution, and Coleman also implicated Thomas. Jurors, however, are not allowed under the rules of criminal procedure to hear one suspect&rsquo;s statement against another.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know there&rsquo;s more things that he did that the jury was not allowed to hear .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so I&rsquo;m a little disappointed,&#8221; she said of the sentencing decision.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still on the table is a defense motion challenging the sufficiency of the evidence against Thomas. Baumgartner said Thursday he would issue a written ruling on that motion in late January or early February.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty good sentence for everyone.  The defense might drop its insufficiency of evidence appeal because if Thomas gets a new trial, the death penalty goes back on the menu.</p>

		<p>Too bad the jury didn&rsquo;t give him the death penalty.  When you have vicious thugs like this in prison, even after they are given a life sentence, you never know what might happen down the road.  You might get another Governor such as George Ryan of Illinois(now serving a prison sentence himself) who decides to grant a blanket amnesty to all lifers and before you know it, they&rsquo;re out on the street, free and eager to kill again.  What about Mike Huckabee? He commuted the sentences of over 1,000 felons when he was governor of Arkansas.  Look what happened just aseveral weeks ago to those four police officers who were executed while doing their paperwork in a restaurant.</p>
<p>These thugs sit in prison enjoying one another&rsquo;s company, and looking for more young white inmates to rape again.  I&rsquo;m sure they just love that.  No, it is best to end their worthless lives when you have the chance.</p>

		<p>the problem with getting life without parole, unless you are in a severe maximum security lockdown prison, is that for the most part its about the same as life on the streets for the blacks even better they even get free college classes. they make friends, work out, watch tv, goof off all day, and get 3 square meals. The difference between a black and a white going to prison is astronomical. </p>

		<p>Trouble with &#8220;life in prison&#8221; is that it isn&rsquo;t. Liberals are doing everything they can to spring their voters - innocence projects, release of the elderly, release because of overcrowding, pardons. Liberals really don&rsquo;t like putting anyone in prison except innocent people who don&rsquo;t follow the liberal party line.</p>

		<p>Life without parole is generally done in maximum-security facilities, both because of the nature of the crimes these inmates have committed, and because due to their sentences, they are considered an escape risk.</p>
<p>My understanding is that the worst places to do prison time are the medium-security correctional institutions.  The inmates are generally younger, often first-time offenders, but also often violent (they haven&rsquo;t aged enough to start slowing down.)  The more relaxed security conditions give inmates more access to each other, which results in more fights, more stabbings, and presumably more sexual assaults.  The nickname for these is &#8220;gladiator schools&#8221;.</p>
<p>Low and minimum-security (camp) facilities are not particularly bad places.  We had dorm rooms without locks on the doors, and the food was about what one would expect in the cafeteria at a bad state college.</p>

<p>The UN has already called for a 20-year maximum prison sentence for any offense.  If they get their way, then they&rsquo;ll want no prison, and the punishment for murder will be an afternoon appointment with the UN self-esteem therapist.</p>

<p>How the organization deteriorated so badly since its inception is a task for somebody to explain in a well-researched book.</p>
<p>I think many people would like to know if people like those now controlling the UN and Western nations arrived at their mental disorders over a period of time or if they were mentally ill to begin with.  Perhaps it was their susceptibility to brainwashing that brought about their conditions, but it would be fascinating to read about how they deteriorated so badly.</p>
<p>As just one brief example.  Harry Reid.  He did everything but back flips to try to get the amnesty bill passed for illegals, then, after the 08 elections, he said it gave him such a warm feeling to know that Hispanics voted for Democrats in large numbers, as if he were completely unaware that they would vote for anybody that would help them take over the country.  In his case, though, is it a mental disorder, brainwashing, or is he just stupid?</p>
<p>As I said, it would be fascinating to find out.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I also agree with the poster who said prison for blacks is a piece of cake.  They&rsquo;re confined with a lot of other tribesman in a tribal, crowded setting just like the old country, only they don&rsquo;t have to get up, go out, and hunt their own food.  It&rsquo;s a step up for the really.<br>

		<p>I think the reason for the correct observations of the posters in this thread about why blacks don&rsquo;t want the death penalty, and do want life in prison, is due to their one cookie now vs five cookies tomorrow that&rsquo;s discussed in the Boise State flyer thread posted on Friday.  The feeble black mind can understand being executed today (though, with a black murder convict, you&rsquo;re lucky to give them the drip in 15 years), but they can&rsquo;t comprehend spending the rest of their lives in one place under the control of others.</p>
<p>Ranger:  I think what happened with the UN is that it started out as mainly a debating society among white countries, but it has turned into a whining forum for non-white countries.  My proposal is to start a new transnational organization for countries whose majorities and leaders are identifiably Caucasian, perhaps called OWN (Organization of White Nations), definitely including Russia and I&rsquo;rael.  Its main purpose would be to keep white people from making war on each other, and to keep non-whites from making war on whites.   Any missile defense shield would be OWN owned, include Russia (why our foreign policy establishment seems to be making Russia mad, I have no clue), and serve the same purpose.</p>

<p>In some states, lifers don&rsquo;t have to wear prison garb, can get an unlimited number of food parcels from outside, get a cushy job in the prison, and have free roam of the place to a large extent. This is so in many cases.</p>

<p>That will be never realized due to the fact that islamic law ie. sharia demands death penalties for certain crimes.</p>

		<p>Court. <br>
Its everywhere.  <br>
On every TV channel; Judge Judy, Perry Mason, # 33, CSI, Miami Vice, Hawaii 5,0, Jerry Springer, CIA, FBI, Texas Rangers, DEA, Homeland Security, HPD and Moury Povich.</p>
<p>But what is it, this thing called court?</p>
<p><b>&ldquo;We know there&rsquo;s more things that he did that the jury was not allowed to hear &hellip; so I&rsquo;m a little disappointed,&rdquo; she said of the sentencing decision. (Chris Newsom&rsquo;s mother)</b></p>
<p>Those of you who have not been to court for anything substantial have no idea what it is about.  Its true nature is a closely held secret and is never allowed to be shown&hellip;. But people have all these quaint imaginations and feelings about what they think court is, and nothing except being the meat in the pie will enlighten them.</p>

		<p>We are told constantly, arbitrarily, but without further analysis or debate, that the death penalty has proven to be absolutely no deterrent to the commission of crime.  </p>
<p>But no, to the contrary, the death penalty is the ONE AND ONLY absolute deterrent to the commission of any further crimes by that particular culprit. Once that &#8220;bad seed&#8221; is eliminated from society   &mdash;   weeded out, as it were   &mdash;    he will NEVER be able to repeat his crime again!  Nor, indeed, to commit ANY other crimes, for that matter. It is the one guarantee that his crime wave is permanently over.</p>
<p>It has always struck me how indicative it is of the low intelligence of blacks that they cannot see that simple fact   &mdash;    something so obvious! You would think they would be glad to have the worst, most diseased, elements eliminated from their ranks, as that would improve the overall quality of their gene pool. It would be doing them a eugenic favor, in other words, to prune out the worst stock.  But instead, they rally to defend their worst elements rather than repudiating them. Absolutely stupid!</p>
