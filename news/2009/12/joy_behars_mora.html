			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Poor, All Academic, November 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like tuning into an episode of &#8220;The View&#8221; for a little exploration of social sensitivities in the modern American culture.</p>
<p>In keeping with that tradition, on Black Friday, a term used to describe the Friday following Thanksgiving, which is the beginning of the traditional Christmas shopping season, the use of the word &#8220;black&#8221; to mark this occasion was a topic of discussion on &#8220;The View&#8221; for its potential &#8220;racist&#8221; implications.</p>
<p>Co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar, who has her own primetime HLN cable show, debated the use of &#8220;black&#8221; on the Nov. 27 pre-recorded broadcast. Goldberg, a black woman, took the meaning to be a positive and that there was nothing wrong with it used that way. Behar, however, was trouble with the word &#8220;black&#8221; used in conjunction with Friday, taking the meaning as a negative (emphasis added): <blockquote>GOLDBERG: Oh, hello and welcome to &#8216;The View.&rsquo; Today is Black Friday, all day long,&#8221; Goldberg said.  &#8220;And I&rsquo;m going to stay black all day because of it.</p>
<p>BEHAR: Isn&rsquo;t it a little racist to call it Black Friday?</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: {snip}</p>
<p>BEHAR:  But there&rsquo;s a negative connotation to it? Or does it mean something else?</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: No, it&rsquo;s like when you make all the money  &mdash;  you&rsquo;re in the black.</p>
<p>BEHAR:  So it&rsquo;s positive?</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Yeah. It&rsquo;s in the black, so it&rsquo;s a huge great thing.</p>
<p>BEHAR: A lot of times, like blackmail is negative, black sheep.</p>
<p>{snip}<br/>

		<p>Get a clue, Joy Behar.  &#8220;Black&#8221; in &#8220;Black Friday&#8221; means that if the accounting year started on January 1 and ended at the end of the Friday after Thanksgiving, then most retailers that show a profit would only show a profit (i.e. be in the black) after that day.  If the accounting year ended before then, many retailers would show a loss.</p>

		<p>Joy Behar is a total moron. I used to listen to her on WABC-NYC AM about two decades ago. She is a no talent who succeeds these days because of the content of her gender and her left wing views. I remember way back when she sandbagged Rush Limbaugh (who I have been no fan of for a long time but back then he wasn&rsquo;t too bad a messenger in getting out a non-left wing mainstream view-although he was no Bob Grant). Rush at the time actually broadcasted out of the EIB Building in Manhattan (actually WABC Studios) and came on after Joy. The one day he was preparing for his show and Joy calls him in and he graciously comes in and she totally was all over him, really low ball stuff, and in the dollars and cents of it she had a lot of nerve attacking the second biggest act on the station without whom she wouldn&rsquo;t have the gig.<br/>
She represents the modern liberal idea that all voices are equal so her shrill no substance view is just as viable as any.  </p>

<p>Ah, these high level intellectuals always come up with brilliant statements like that.  Don&rsquo;t forget, Joy, about Angel Food Cake being black, as well as black holes in space.</p>
<p>All this racist language has to be eliminated if we are to achieve our 1984 utopia where everyone is brilliant and unbiased, guided by the propaganda of Big Brother.</p>
<p>If there is a more worthless, stupid show on television other than The View, I can&rsquo;t think of what it might be right now.</p>
<p>With geniuses like her, our side doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance.</p>

		<p>Of course the meaning of &#8220;Black&#8221; Friday has nothing to do with our African American friends. The term was first devised to indicate when businesses went &#8220;out of the red&#8221; and &#8220;into the black&#8221;. Traditionally the bookkeeper used red ink to indicate loss and black ink to indicate profit. </p>
<p>Theoretically, the time of year when fixed costs were paid and  profitability begins was said to be the Friday following Thanksgiving. As clever marketers worked their wares, that Friday began to be a tool of marketing itself.</p>
<p>In order to placate our African American friends, perhaps the best solution would be to outlaw white colored paper and sell only black colored paper. That way, white ink would be required for writing purposes in order to see what is written thereon.</p>
<p>That still would leave us with the problem of using red colored ink to indicate loss. Its not beyond the realm of imagination that the communists would be marching in the streets because of the difficulty seeing red ink on a black paper background. </p>

<p>Joy Behar, has to be the stupidest white woman alive!</p>
<p>The above exchange between Whoopi Goldberg and herself only, and all too painfully, proves this in spades. Whoopi Goldberg is by no means a rocket scientist, and she is all too quick to jump on the &ldquo;that&rsquo;s racist&rdquo; bandwagon most of the time; however, here she is  demonstrating a depth of understanding as to the seasonal vernacular term &ldquo;Black Friday,&rdquo; that is surprisingly clear and correct. It is a highly positive term, that describes the color of the ink on the sales ledgers and balance sheets to be found in retail and wholesale outlets in this country, not the pigment of the skin or the mood of the day. </p>
<p>Comrade Joy might prefer it to be a Red Friday, but that only accentuates her humorless fanaticisms and arrogant ignorance for all to see.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Joy Behar makes me ill.  She is extreme in many of her views.  She is the epitome of the negative Northeasterner sterotype.  The only reason she has her own show is because she promotes the way, way Left agenda.  There is nothing professional - or likable - about her.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that Behar should be taking cheap shots at Sarah Palin&rsquo;s intellect when she has so little &#8216;intellect&rsquo; or education herself.</p>

		<p>This is a near perfect example; be offended first, determine facts later (if at all).<br/>
BTW the facts are that many retail establishments are at a loss for the year (or in accounting parlance in the red) until Thanksgiving.  The holiday rush pushes them into a profitable mode (in accounting terms, in the black).  It has nothing to do with race, just the color of accounting ink.  Note Microsoft&rsquo;s excel program allows one to color negative values in red, positive in black.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting to see how long it would be before someone found a problem with this designation. Sounds like Behar needs to get a life. After all, what could the day after Thanksgiving possibly have to do with blacks, unless it&rsquo;s in reference to the increased shoplifting, carjacking, burglary and gang activity at the shopping malls?</p>

		<p>I cannot believe Joy Behar has taken issue with the term &#8220;Black Friday.&#8221; Obviously, this poor, misguided woman sees racial slurs in every corner of the English language. Of course the battalions of PC do-gooders and their cohorts, the language police, have caused much destruction to the richness of the English language, but that&rsquo;s another blog snippet. </p>
<p>What would Joy Behar make of Yankee, pitching legend, Whitey Ford or the Labrador Retriever down the street from me who is aptly named Blackie? </p>
<p>Soon Joy you will be the victim of your own foolish beliefs and sentiments. The language police are watching you. Your name is Joy, and that means happiness. If you&rsquo;re named Joy, you must be happy all the time. Your constant happiness is an insult to the unhappy, downtrodden non-whites of this nation. You must change your name immediately to one from the list of acceptable names authorized by the government. May we suggest LaFahwanda as a suitable name replacement. </p>

It&rsquo;s ironic that of all the expressions that blacks complain about that allegedly use black as a pejorative, &#8216;black Friday&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t one of them. As Ms. Goldberg said, &#8220;Yeah. It&rsquo;s in the black, so it&rsquo;s a huge great thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms. Behar, in her ignorance, would remove one positive black reference from our vocabulary.</p>
<p>Green Friday? Isn&rsquo;t that an ethnic slur against the &#8220;Mics&#8221;?</p>

		<p>I thought blacks were always whining that the word &#8220;black&#8221; never means anything positive in the English language (&#8220;black sheep,&#8221; &#8220;devil&rsquo;s food cake,&#8221; &#8220;black hole,&#8221; etc.) and here is a case where the word &#8220;black&#8221; means something very positive indeed, and yet this fool Joy Behar is trying her best to turn it into a negative!  In fact, I think Behar was baiting Goldberg and blacks in general with this stupid comment, as if blacks need any encouragement to take offense at the most innocuous things. Behar ought to be ashamed, but of course she won&rsquo;t be.</p>

		<p>All you are right about the original meaning of black friday. But stereotypes are true. Blacks are what they are. Now black friday is a day where whites see blacks stealing, trampling people to death, and behaving like a bunch of unorganized animals on the news. So, it is racist; racist because they act black. </p>

		<p>#20&rsquo;s observation about RED ink is spot on!  If the Native Ams. were as numerous and vocal as blacks, I&rsquo;m sure the media would be publicizing this &#8220;insult&#8221;!  <br/>
Behar and much of cable TV is now mostly drivel.  People just ramble on about anything, often using the wrong word and misplaced concept.  My husband points out many of the stupid remarks made; I personally seldom watch anything on the tube anymore.</p>

<p>Joy Behar is a moron and anybody that takes anything she says as serious, is a moron.  She is a washed up comedian whose only asset (if you can call it that) is her looney left beliefs.  That puts her smack in the middle of the main stream media that as we all know, has been completely hijacked by loony, 60&rsquo;s has beens. </p>

		<p>In a related story, St. Louis City has a black woman elected comptroller, whose last name is Green.  She was St. Louis City&rsquo;s first black comptroller, in fact elected on the same day as St. Louis&rsquo;s first black mayor.  The first time she ran for re-election, she was on a local black talk radio show, touting her accomplishments of keeping St. Louis City&rsquo;s budget profitable.  (Even though the Board of Aldermen allocate the budget.)  She said that her campaign slogan, based on her &#8220;keeping the city profitable,&#8221; is that St. Louis needs to stay &#8220;in the Green&#8221; by re-electing her, a double entendre also involving her name.  I called the show up asking her and the host:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t you mean in the black?&#8221;</p>
<p>Two can play at the game of double entendres.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always assumed the term &#8220;Black Friday&#8221; was a play on the 1977 film &#8220;Black Sunday,&#8221; involving a terrorist attack on the Super Bowl.  Does this mean that the film was Racist, too?  I can&rsquo;t wait to hear Joy&rsquo;s [sic] insightful analysis.<br/>
