<h1><a href="https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE5BE3KC20091215">French Minister Tells Muslims to Speak Properly</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, December 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A junior French minister has told young Muslims living in France they should dress properly, find a job and stop speaking slang.</p>
<p>Opposition politicians from the left denounced the comments by the minister for families, Nadine Morano, as racist.</p>
<p>The highly outspoken Morano, who is a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s inner circle, made the remarks on Monday evening in a small town in eastern France during a government-inspired debate on national identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not putting young Muslims on trial. I respect their situation. What I want is for them to feel French because they are French,&#8221; she said in a recording played on French radio.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want them to love France when they live here, to find work and not to speak in slang,&#8221; she said, adding: &#8220;They shouldn&rsquo;t put their caps on back to front.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anti-racism groups and Socialist politicians accused Morano of stoking racial tensions and said the government should abandon its series of highly controversial national identity debates before they provoked a violent backlash.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sarkozy&rsquo;s government has tightly linked the issues of immigration and integration and launched the national identity debate last month, playing on a theme that had served Sarkozy well during his successful 2007 election campaign.</p>
<p>Critics say the countrywide discussions will simply open a Pandora&rsquo;s box of prejudice and extremism.<br>

<p>No. It&rsquo;s the &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; groups and Socialist politicians who have stoked racial tensions. And everyone else is left to suffer the consequences.</p>

		<p>While the French govt is miles ahead of Britain and America when it comes to insisting immigrants assimilate, the sad fact is that Muslims will never assimilate. Their goal is to conquer and exterminate the Christian world. Until Muslims are shipped back to North Africa, France will be in mortal danger. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, even a patriot like Sarkozy and his advisers won&rsquo;t do what is necessary to block the cancerous growth that Muslim population growth represents. The Racist chant will block the expulsion of groups that want to destroy France, not build France.</p>

		<p>This is exactly the same advice that Bill Cosby gave to lower class african americans. I wonder if these kids realize that no one will give them a job when they wear baggy pants, ball caps, and t shirts with offensive messages. No employer wants to hire people that he would afraid of on the streets.</p>

		<p>The most dangerous threat against western civilization is not from Blacks, Muslims, or other sorted miscreants and undesirables, it is from a mindless group of severely misguided Whites who are hellbent on committing cultural suicide, extinguising our race, and taking us all along for the ride.</p>
<p>The egalitarians are destroying us, but we have the power to interfere. Stop engaging in any form of commerce beyond your immediate needs for food and shelter! Wake up and stop spending! Speak with your wallets!!!</p>

<p>The French are fond of their pork soup? Let Nadine go to into the Metro and try to offer a cup of pork soup to some of these &#8220;French&#8221; and see what the reaction is.</p>
<p> &ldquo;They shouldn&rsquo;t put their caps on back to front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nadine is a goner. That statement of hers is an act of war. She is going to be out of a job soon.</p>

		<p>Have you heard about the kind of lyrics Arab rappers living in France «sing»? It&rsquo;s all about hate and f  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   France.</p>
<p>Muslims in France tend to create Third World enclaves in the very middle of the country. Anti-French, and Anti-Western enclaves, in fact.</p>
<p>I say, deport them! For Britain, it almost seems too late, but the French should get rid of anti-French radical elements in their own cities. </p>

		<p>While, in principle, Arabs are expected to assimilate, they don&rsquo;t, and the government response is to pay for their housing, their healthcare, and  their education. The percentage of Arabs and Africans on the dole was high even when economic conditions were better. They make life worse for everyone else, and they are a drag on the economy.</p>
<p>Although Ms. Murano should be applauded for speaking out, we can&rsquo;t miss that she, in the end, is saying, &#8220;Look, as long as you are here, behave like human beings.&#8221; I don&rsquo;t believe that such changes will occur anymore than I believe Ms. Murano can get dogs to stop walking on all four legs, and defecating on the sidewalks. The Arabs in today&rsquo;s France represent several generations on the dole. They are of no value to any Frenchman.   </p>

<p>These blacks are not Arabs! they are African blacki muslims, a totally different sort of animal and even the Arab muslims don&rsquo;t like them. Black muslims are being used as shock troops to take over the EU for the Saudi king, you remember him, the one Obama BOWED down to.</p>

<p>Of course they won&rsquo;t! Sarkozy isn&rsquo;t even &#8220;French&#8221;. Feller was doing alright until he came up with that humdinger.  Mistaking Sarkozy and his advisors&#8221; for  &#8220;patriots&#8221;  is the greatest mistake that many Frenchmen made when they voted for him two years ago. </p>
<p>Question:  has he actually DONE anything about the problem in the time that he has been in office?  Silly question! It&rsquo;s worse than ever. (Le Pen could have told you so.)</p>

		<p>It is sad that a person like myself of Norman French descent, who loved France,  whose forefathers ruled England, and whose Huguenot forefathers (god bless them) were not permitted to live in France after the Edict of Nantes was lifted.  All of this is fine.  War is hell and I accept that my huguenot forefathers lost there and France was still France i.e patriotic and nationalistic.  However, what I can&rsquo;t accept is they threw us out and later let the Muslim live there.  Unacceptable.  The French  need to rise up and throw the Muslim out. Period.  Kick them out.  Start 50 million 1 person campaigns and rid the French lands of Muslims and other foreigners. Don&rsquo;t apologize.  You didn&rsquo;t apologize when you threw me out and you don&rsquo;t have to do so.  I won&rsquo;t come back but I&rsquo;m rooting for the French to rise and reclaim your land.  Don&rsquo;t apologize.  Kicking the Muslim out like the Spanish kicked the Muslim out is the Lord&rsquo;s work.  Do the Lord&rsquo;s work.  First, use words to tell them to go home.  Isolate traitor politicians and try them for treason and hang them after they are convicted.  Lastly, make laws to kick the Muslim out.  Do not apologize.  </p>

		<p>The same goes for America.  Start grass roots movements to kick the foreigners out.  Do it by legal means.  Isolate the politicians, create treason lawsuits i.e. lawsuits against politicians for not upholding the constitution to protect its citizens.  Bring lawsuits against religious and other organizations for not upholding the laws and protecting the homeland.  Make it so miserable for all that the foreigner will gladly get out and so will his treasonous supporters.  You&rsquo;ll be doing the Lord&rsquo;s work.  Don&rsquo;t apologize and keep yelling.  Also actively support the 2nd amendment - you know what I mean.  </p>
