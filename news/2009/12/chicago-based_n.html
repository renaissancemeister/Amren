<h1>Chicago-Based Nation of Islam Wrongly Targeted</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chicago Sun-Times, December 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Newly released government papers show homeland security officials improperly gathered intelligence on the Nation of Islam.</p>
<p>The 2007 report  &mdash;  titled &#8220;Nation of Islam: Uncertain Leadership Succession Poses Risks&#8221;  &mdash;  was created by an intelligence group within the Bush administration&rsquo;s Department of Homeland Security, according to documents made public Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hours after the report was issued in 2007, officials recalled it, deciding it violated intelligence rules against collecting or disseminating information on U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>A top official in the Chicago-based Nation of Islam declined comment. DHS spokesman Matt Chandler said the Obama administration &#8220;has implemented a strong and rigorous system of safeguards and oversight to ensure similar products are neither created nor distributed.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the documents, while government rules were &#8220;unintentionally and inadvertently violated,&#8221; only publicly available information was collected. One official wrote that &#8220;the organization despite its highly volatile and extreme rhetoric has neither advocated violence nor engaged in violence&#8221; and should not have been the subject of intelligence gathering.</p>

		<p>Perhaps they have not actually advocated violence, but highly volatile and extreme rhetoric pumped into the brains and into the consciousnesses of lame-brains often results in violence.  </p>
<p>This is why most Southern states (including MO, St. Louis blacks were often put on boats that sailed the Illinois side of the MS river at STL for literacy lessons) antebellum had laws that prohibited teaching blacks how to read.  It&rsquo;s not because the political/slaveholding (they were pretty much one and the same) class was sadistic, it was because they knew, as Alexander Pope said, a little learning can be a dangerous things.  They were worried that if blacks knew how to read, their newly literate minds wouldn&rsquo;t be directed towards Shakespeare, Milton and Chaucer, they would be directed toward Haiti-style insurrectionist rhetoric (in fact, most black literacy orgs had links to John Brown style bigmouths), and the obvious first targets would have been the white slaveholders.  The events in Haiti in the late 18th and early 19th century was very much on the minds of American slave holders.</p>
<p>Even today, most blacks can &#8220;read,&#8221; such as it is.  And what have they done with their ability to read?  Look at the AR archives to find out   &mdash;   e.g. conspiracy theories that blue jeans were planted with sterilization chemicals, Louis Farrakhan&rsquo;s orbiting spaceship axiom, that the Circle K on the Snapple label means the K-organization (it really means kosher for Jewish consumption, quite a bit different   &mdash;   the media pushed this theory, in spite of the fact that they knew better for very obvious reasons, b/c Snapple was a Limbaugh/Stern advertiser in the early days of their shows), and so on.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Obama&rsquo;s people junking a Bush-era surveillance plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>First the Black Panthers and now one million black, white-hating Muslims.  And don&rsquo;t forget Acorn.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s civilian corps that he promised that would be as strong and as well-funded as the military is coming along nicely.</p>
<p>I wonder if they&rsquo;ll have access to military weapons.</p>

		<p>The DHS thinks the NOI is just fine. But people with Ron Paul bumper stickers should be on a watch list?</p>

		<p>All through history the bad guys have always anounced their intentions well in advance of whatever mayhem they plan.  We know what the Nation of Islam wants, as well as La Raza, and assorted other death to whites groups.  Yet we do nothing.  Truly humans are incapable of learning from history.</p>

		<p>The NOI is a organization that receives forein money to try to violently overthrow our nation. They should be watched. Better, they should be shut down.</p>

		<p>There were members of the Nation of Islam in Philadelphia that were convicted criminals who used Temple no 12, the Nation of Islam mosque in Philadelphia as the cover for their activities. They were involved in drug dealing and extortion and were responsible for murders in Philadelphia, Atlantic City, and Washington DC. They called themselves the Black Mafia and their rampage continued until 1974 when many of the major players were convicted and served long prison sentences.</p>
