<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mexican officials plan to kick off a year&rsquo;s worth of bicentennial events, commemorating their independence with a float at the 2010 Tournament of Roses Parade.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s about putting Mexico in an international forum .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like the Rose Parade,&#8221; said Juan Marcos Gutierrez, consul general of Mexico in Los Angeles. &#8220;The message is pretty much that today we are starting the celebrations throughout the year.&#8221;</p>
<p>The float  &mdash;  featuring floral replicas of the Aztec calendar and Mexico City&rsquo;s Angel of Independence, skirted by 36 people dancing to traditional Mexican music  &mdash;  is the first time in recent years that the nation has featured a float in the parade.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This coming year, the country celebrates 100 years since the Mexican revolution and 200 years of independence from Spain.</p>
<p>Wells Fargo and Televisa are sponsoring most of the float&rsquo;s cost.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 24-foot-high and 55-foot-long float is already sparking ill will among some in the anti-illegal immigration crowd.</p>
<p>Message boards on Web sites and e-mails are aflutter with criticism for the float, which is to be decorated by hundreds of volunteers, including Mexican immigrants and their families and 31 Girl Scout troops from Orange County.</p>
<p>Barbara Coe, leader of Huntington Beach-based California Coalition for Immigration Reform, said she&rsquo;s attended the parade in years past.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not going to go this year. I can tell you that,&#8221; Coe said. &#8220;There are others who are not really happy about it either. I&rsquo;ve had a few e-mails and some calls.&#8221;</p>

		<p>So what are they going to do - throw tamales to the crowd?  I mean, who CARES about Mexican holidays???  I&rsquo;m sure the Catholic Church (yes, I&rsquo;m Catholic) is ecstatic - but the Church never offered to pay for the illegals&rsquo; health care, welfare, reproduction rate   &mdash;   no, we the legal citizens are stuck with all that.  Yo Holy Father - no wonder your income&rsquo;s down and so is the income in every church, diocese and archdiocese in the nation!  We LEGAL citizens don&rsquo;t WANT illegals here!!!  </p>

<p>I wonder how many of the 31 Girl Scouts will be lewdly gawked at by these &ldquo;Mexican immigrants,&rdquo; or worse?</p>
<p>That has to be one of the oddest and ugliest looking &ldquo;floats&rdquo; that I have ever seen; if that is cultural &ldquo;enrichment,&rdquo; you can just let me go into Multicultural Chapter 11. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The float &mdash; featuring floral replicas of the Aztec calendar and Mexico City&rsquo;s Angel of Independence, skirted by 36 people dancing to traditional Mexican music&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p>Well, why stop there, why not sacrifice a few people on the freakish thing too? </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>What is really needed is a float depicting mourning for the failed state of Mexico.</p>
<p>That millions of people have been forced to flee Mexico should be expressed in sadness and shame.  And, because the Aztecs ceased as an effective tribe years ago should be expressed also as a cause for mourning and shame.</p>
<p>The people in that region have failed as a tribe and a people for centuries.  Now they are in danger of losing the entire Mexican nation to drug cartels.  Their legacy is one of abysmal failure.  The last thing they should ever do is celebrate any of it.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know about all this, to me this is kind of a non-issue, a distraction from the real issues - who cares if the Mexican gov&rsquo;t wants to sponsor a float in a parade?  The history of Mexico and California are intertwined, so they may as well contribute something interesting and of historical significance to the parade.  That being said, any Americans promoting Mexican interests over that of the United States should be arrested and tried for Treason.</p>

<p>You mean to tell me that as many MEXICANS that are in the L.A. area, THEY  can&rsquo;t pay for it themselves! I would like to know how much they&rsquo;ll charge these companies for this float, seeing as they will have &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of &#8220;volunteers&#8221; to decorate it. It would be interesting to &#8220;follow the money&#8221;.<br>
When I lived in Texas it always p&rsquo;d me off with all the Cinco de Mayo nonsense. They&rsquo;d have a Cinco de Mayo party where I worked [ the U.S. Post Office in Houston of all places ] and I&rsquo;d be about the only one that wouldn&rsquo;t participate in it and would LOUDLY tell them why. Of course, that made me out to be a &#8220;racissss&#8221; in their eyes which didn&rsquo;t bother me a bit. Now I live in the mid-west and never hear it mentioned. </p>

		<p>How many major (or minor) foreign cities have a parade float to celebrate our Independence Day (you know, the holiday most people call the 4th of July).  Now, if memory serves me, during our bicentennial (I was in HS) foreign ships came TO NYC for the bicentennial and Philadelphia moved the Liberty Bell to a new display site.  But I don&rsquo;t recall any celebrations in Mexico City.  Maybe next year they can celebrate California&rsquo;s independence from the US.<br>

		<p>When one lives in most places in California nowadays, one is used to the mestizo idiocy that goes on. For example, where I live close to Lost Angeles, there are several Mexican celebrations of one type or another, that include fireworks with live gunfire,throughout the year. You kind of live the life of a fireman, and if you go to bed too early, you might be shocked out of your sleep at any time of the night.</p>
<p>I see the Rose Float Mexican thing as a simple demonstration, celebration and affirmation of their usual &#8220;in the California citizenries faces demonstration that they have conquered California. If you listen to these mestizo&rsquo;s and read many of their blogs, they gloat about their numbers all the time, and how nothing can be done about it. And nothing is done about it.</p>

		<p>I went to the parade for the first time 2 years ago.  We were way past where all the cameras were and it was nothing but a crowd of mexicans, a lot of them acting obnoxiously.  That did it for me, never going to that parade again.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s just about the ugliest thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen. But, it did take an artist to create it. Now, since Mexico lacks so many talented, educated people, I would think the person who did this, would be highly valued in his own country. The young people who get a high school education at our expense and who gripe about not being able to go to college or get a job, could surely go back and help their own people - like teaching the children of Mexico. Perhaps they could impart some messages like: &#8220;Children, we don&rsquo;t break into someone else&rsquo;s country, we don&rsquo;t have anchor babies who allow us to bring 50 of our closest relatives in to sponge off the American taxpayer, we don&rsquo;t rob, rape, molest, steal or commit any crimes there. We march in our own country and demand that it gets cleaned up and offer us a living so we won&rsquo;t have to dishonor the laws of a country was forced to take care of us because we are so corrupt.</p>

		<p>   I attended the Rose Parade in the late &rsquo;60s to early &rsquo;70s. My great uncle, my grandmother&rsquo;s brother, had a home not far from the parade route. He and his wife were so hospitable and kind and would let us spend the night at their home and get up early to stake out places along the route It was a time where you could set out a wooden bench and observe all the festivities.  It was a golden time before California became overcrowded and filled with foreigners.<br>
   Now, I just watch the parade on telelvision to avoid the cold and crowds. Since I read this story though, I think I&rsquo;ll decline.  </p>

<i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about putting Mexico in an international forum &hellip; like the Rose Parade,&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t Mexico have the equivalent of the Rose Parade in Mexico? Why does Mexico have to go outside of Mexico to promote and showcase their country?</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t about Mexicans, nor is it about celebrating Mexico.  This is about a certain racial group, that has no real allegiance to the Mexican government, seeking its own country.  The land they have chosen for that country is OURS.</p>
<p>That is the point.  They share a culture with Mexicans but have an political ideology that can&rsquo;t coexist peacefully with other &#8220;Mexicans&#8221;.  It has lead to war within Mexico and invasion of the US, in order so that they might separate themselves from others and create a new country.</p>
<p>The big problem with this is the land they have invaded is the US.  They see us as weak and that there is an opportunity to take what isn&rsquo;t theirs with little risk (and a lot of help from crazy, even treasonous, people on both sides of the border who give them incredible amounts of aid of various forms for various reasons).</p>
<p>A handful of people want to wave around a Mexican flag and celebrate where they came from?  Not a big deal.</p>
<p>What these people are doing is a VERY big deal, however.  And really has nothing to do with the former.</p>

		<p>The Rose Bowl parade has always had a Spanish influence to some extent. Celebrating the Spanish heritage of CA. Usually riders on Arabian horses dressed in the Spanish manner, NOT the Mexican manner. Riding clubs showing off equestrian skill and being influenced to some degree by the Hollywood elite who at one time saw themselves as inheritors to the legacy of the wealthy white Spanish grandees? Hard to say but what percentage of Pasadena is now populated by those of Mexican ancestry, the mixed meztiso?</p>

		<p>How about a float showing Mexican troops murdering the survivors of the Alamo?</p>
<p>By the way, have we EVER received an apology for that?  And why isn&rsquo;t THAT taught in our schools?</p>
<p>Too, maybe they can contribute a float display of Sam Houston taking the war criminal Santa Ana&hellip;dressed as a woman&hellip;.into custody after his defeat by a numerically smaller US force.</p>
<p>Or how about a float showing a Mexican swiumming the Rio Grande or climbing over a wall to get to the US illegally?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re all about truth and reality nowadays aren&rsquo;t we?</p>

		<p>I spent part of my youth in California&rsquo;s Central Valley and in the early Fifties we studied the &#8220;Californios&#8221; or &#8220;Old California&#8221; and in the fourth grade even had a picnic day in which we staged a &#8220;fiesta&#8221; dressed in homemade Old Californian. garb.  The funny thing is throughout my school days there up until 1962 there were really hardly any Mexicans.  I think studying some of the origins of California was ok but we went from there to actually studying American things and even took a whole year - required by state law at that time - studying our constitution topped off by a mandatory, must pass exam.  Of course, when we studied Old California we weren&rsquo;t really studying Mexico but a colonial culture that was deeply Catholic and European in nature and, for sure, we weren&rsquo;t glorifying &#8220;bronze&rsquo; but more or less the thing that existed before it became ours.</p>

		<p>Mexifornians are not going anywhere. It is futile to complain about the situation that has been occurring in the southwest for hundreds of years. We&rsquo;ve lost that battle/war.</p>
<p>It is time to get involved in state secessionist and 10th amendment movements to preserve what we have left before we have no living spaces to call our own.<br>

<p>But the United States can&rsquo;t possibly lose California! You can&rsquo;t lose Silicon valley, Stanford University, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Hollywood, and so many other American institutions, to Mestizo illegal immigrants, who are treated like pariahs, in their country of origin.</p>
<p>Okay, so there are many of them. But you have the money, and the guns!</p>
<p>Send the army to clean up California, if you have to, but I honestly can&rsquo;t imagine the US giving up California without a fight.</p>
