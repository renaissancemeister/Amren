<h1><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/dec/11/a-black-panther-sings-28726124/">A Black Panther Sings</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Washington Times, December 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The heat is rising against the Justice Department&rsquo;s mishandling of the voter intimidation case against the New Black Panther Party and three of its members. The last thing Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. needed was for the party&rsquo;s national chieftain to resurface in Mr. Holder&rsquo;s defense, but that&rsquo;s exactly what Malik Zulu Shabazz, the party chairman, did on Dec. 4. It says a lot about the Obama Justice Department that it is being promoted by a Black Panther.</p>
<p>In doing so, Mr. Shabazz refocused the spotlight on the fact that he was one of the original defendants for whom Mr. Holder&rsquo;s department dropped charges. The party as a whole also was an original defendant, likewise unpunished despite widespread advice to the contrary from career lawyers at Justice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s a political witch hunt, part of the overall war that the Republicans are waging against Eric Holder in general,&#8221; Mr. Shabazz complained. {snip}</p>
<p>The problem is, this seems to contradict previous statements by Mr. Shabazz and other top party leaders. The Jackson Sun in Tennessee reported that three days before the 2008 election, &#8220;Minister Najee Muhammad, national field marshal for the New Black Panther Party, and Uhuru Shakur, local chairman of the Atlanta chapter of the party, took turns reading statements from Dr. Malik Shabazz, leader of Black Lawyers for Justice and attorney for the party.&#8221; Mr. Shakur added, &#8220;We will be at the polls in the cities and counties in many states to ensure that the enemy does not sabotage the black vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the election, on Nov. 7, 2008, Mr. Shabazz spoke live on the Fox News Channel to defend his fellow party members. Claiming that they had brought a weapon to the Philadelphia polling place in response to the presence of neo-Nazis, Mr. Shabazz said, &#8220;When we found that this was an emergency response [to the supposed Nazis in the parking lot], there was an explanation&#8221; for brandishing the weapon.</p>
<p>No other source, including the patsy Justice Department, has shown any evidence of white supremacist activity at the voting site. Either way, the statements of Mr. Shabazz and Mr. Shakur hardly comport with the Justice Department&rsquo;s conclusion that the party itself did not promote and condone voter intimidation. Nor does it explain why the department was so willing to accept Mr. Shabazz&rsquo;s refusal even to answer the charges in court  &mdash;  before the department unilaterally acted to drop them.</p>

		<p>Intimidation of White voters can take many forms. People ask what it will take to wake up White people. Perhaps the greater populace thought that this was an isolated incident happening at one Philly polling station. After all, where they voted, they might not have had to run a gauntlet of black or Hispanic thugs to get in the door. Or had been subjected to self-appointed poll watchers running their mouths. I would not be surprised that ACORN, etc., did not field similar bad actors in Chicago and other &#8220;chocolate cities.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Do you believe the radical islamists are evil? then you should really consider the converted native blacks&rsquo; and their lack of any historical understanding, their conversion is islam is a bad omen.</p>
<p>When you live your entire life with hate speech, vengence motives, and political protection, that&rsquo;s bad for the home team.<br>
Ever try to have a reasonable conversation with one of these types?  Think again, there is no reasoning ability.</p>
<p>Wake up whitey and lock the door, they may kick it down, but be ready.</p>

		<p>One of my friends&rsquo; father, obviously a white man, showed me his guns and said he was getting ready for the revolution.  So it&rsquo;s nice to know that we have some whites out there who have awakened and are ready to fight back.  That&rsquo;s why I exercise alot, lift weights, run, and do a good job trying to eat healthy and avoiding fast food.  Plus I am planning for my financial future.  Whites all need to be quick, strong, fit, and smart in the coming years because things won&rsquo;t look pretty!</p>

		<p>Well, hey, you elect a radical black president who has an even more radical black wife   &mdash;   what do you expect??  Obama has chosen nothing but radical leftists for government positions; Holder is one of many.  White people better wake up to the fact that Obama and his cohorts want REVENGE   &mdash;   revenge on white people for all the supposed grievances of blacks.  Other minorities aren&rsquo;t really all that important to them.  They are black oriented and are going to promote black causes, and are going to exonerate all the black criminals that they can.  Get ready, white America   &mdash;   you ain&rsquo;t seen nothin&rsquo; yet&hellip;</p>

		<p>Shabazz?  Were not they close friends to MLK&rsquo;s family?  Something is not right.  Solidarity with the white people.  God will bless you in our struggle for liberation!</p>
