<p>College-educated black men, especially, have struggled relative to their white counterparts in this downturn, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate for black male college graduates 25 and older in 2009 has been nearly twice that of white male college graduates  &mdash;  8.4 percent compared with 4.4 percent.</p>
<p>Various academic studies have confirmed that black job seekers have a harder time than whites. A study published several years ago in The American Economic Review titled &#8220;Are Emily and Greg More Employable than Lakisha and Jamal?&#8221; found that applicants with black-sounding names received 50 percent fewer callbacks than those with white-sounding names.</p>
<p>A more recent study, published this year in The Journal of Labor Economics found white, Asian and Hispanic managers tended to hire more whites and fewer blacks than black managers did.</p>

<p>Who wants to hire someone who has been generously given special entry into an institution, special grading and a certificate they didn&rsquo;t earn?</p>
<p>The great tragedy here is that the blacks who have been hired have edged out qualified whites.  A black with a degree means he/she reads and communicates on a high school level&hellip;..and many are not that competent&hellip;..and can do basic math&hellip;.MAYBE!</p>
<p>They insist not only on being awarded everything without earning anything, they require that we all pretend that they are qualified.  It&rsquo;s a hard pill to swallow.</p>

		<p>  If tests of knowledge were applied it would be obvious that many blacks with college degrees should not have the degrees.<br>
Affirmative action and demands for equal results without equal knowledge are the problem.<br>
  I think that all Liberals should be hiring the unqualified since they demanded that they get special treatment so they could graduate.  This would end the special treatment and the foolish Liberals would face reality or go broke.<br>

		<p>When you hire a black grad, you also risk a potential lawsuit should they eventually be removed from their position due to incompetence or even criminal behavior. Sueing corporations at some time in their lives is a common fantasy among blacks and thus the lawsuit lottery is played daily by that group throughout the country.     </p>

		<p>A confluence of three things.  The fact that those degrees weren&rsquo;t earned and so the mean nothing about the skill set they represent.  The fact that you can&rsquo;t fire the worker once you hire them because of corrupt courts.  And the fact that people will no longer tolerate the forced hiring of them and won&rsquo;t elect to government anyone who pushes this&hellip;.anymore.</p>
<p>The real trouble, however, is going to start when the government goes bankrupt and can no longer pay welfare.</p>

		<p>It is too bad that black men with undergraduate degrees have an unemployment rate that is twice the white man rate.  However, I bet if you adjusted the study for GPA, you&rsquo;d find that the unemployment rate for white men greatly exceeds that of blacks.</p>
<p>In other words, I would not be surprised that for persons with an undergraduate GPA of, say 3.4 to 3.6, you&rsquo;d find that the white man unemployment rate would greatly exceed the black man&rsquo;s unemployment rate.  Just a thought.  I know that when I was in a top MBA program, that I was amazed at some of the offers that the black students received.  I would often think &#8220;You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me.  I am much smarter than that black guy who got that offer to work for __________ (you fill in the blank).&#8221;</p>

		<p>Well, because of the whole affirmative action thing, potential employers know that a diploma held by a Black person may have been earned simply through such a process&hellip; So they won&rsquo;t really want to hire them, even though some Blacks have Ivy League degrees.</p>

		<p>I believe there a couple of reasons why businesses would want to avoid hiring black college graduates. Many of them may have degrees because institutions want them to have them, not that they have learned what is necessary to have <i>earned</i> them.</p>
<p>Also once a black is hired, if his or her work is not satisfactory, the business is likely to be sued by that black employee, and the way the system works, the business will be considered guilty until they can prove their innocence. Often that is not possible, so it could cost a great deal of money. It is less likely that a successful suit would come from a refusal to hire.</p>
<p>Women of child-bearing age are also a problem. If they decide to have a family, the business can be forced to hold the job open. All the idiot rules promoted by liberals have unintended consequences.</p>

		<p>I went to graduate school twice - once in the 1970&rsquo;s, and once in the late 1990&rsquo;s.  The difference was astounding.  In the 1970&rsquo;s, I had to be reading fluent in 4 languages just to get in to my program; we had to pass &#8220;writtens&#8221; to be accepted into the Ph.D. program; and only the best and most qualified got in.  There were no black students in my program.  Skip to late 1990s:  we were supposed to create &#8220;study groups&#8221; instead of working on our own; the reading assignments were short and easy; all kinds of people were in the classes; and to get an M.A. we had to pass a comprehensive exam.  I did it on the first try, which was something of a record, as I learned later.  Point being, by the 1990&rsquo;s the liberal dumbing-down of educational standards was in full swing, the quality of the education was nil, and basically everybody bought their degree.  A college degree was cheapened in that anybody could get one, and the standards were so low that an idiot could have gotten through (and many did, as again I found out later).  So, today as ever, employers are looking for quality, intelligent, knowledgeable employees - and the people who have those prerequisites are mostly whites and Asians.  Plain and simple.  Certainly there are exceptions - but in the main, that&rsquo;s how it is.  Affirmative action doesn&rsquo;t take a person very far in the job market.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see a great many blacks getting degrees in electrical engineering, physics, or mathematics.  I am not shocked to find that when they major in black studies and the like that they find themselves unemployable.  Naturally the New York Times pretends that a degree is a degree, in order to further their anti-white agenda.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand this story. True, many blacks got their degrees due to little more than affirmative action, but I thought employers were falling all over themselves to hire black college grads for the same reason. Affirmative action doesn&rsquo;t just exist in the college market, it exists in the labor market too.</p>

		<p>Get this: </p>
<p>I am a substitute teacher because I cannot get a real teaching job where I live, due to the school district having hired an abundance of teachers already. I hold a BA degree in English. </p>
<p>The other day I was substituting in a classroom where the teacher was black. On her wall above her desk was a BA degree from UC Berkley in &#8220;African American Drama&#8221; with a minor in &#8220;Black Studies&#8221;!!! </p>
<p>Can you believe that??? </p>
<p>This is the type of degree most blacks get and then they are hired under affirmative action statutes! And we wonder why public education in America is a failing endeavor now??? </p>

		<p>First of all, there is much more to any real job interview than whether or not one simply possesses a degree. In most jobs that would require a degree in the first place, interpersonal skills are critical, and on this front alone blacks tend to struggle. Blacks also tend to have little to no other workplace experience compared to whites, degree or not. Blacks rarely have activities like community service or even the Boy/Girl scouts or the like in their background. </p>
<p>It is also remarkable how differently even educated blacks and whites come across in person. Well, it is remarkable to anyone who hasn&rsquo;t spent their entire life surrounded by them, or will admit it anyway. </p>

		<p>As I was going over the comments found along with the original article, several things struck me:</p>
<p>1. The number of people, mostly white, agreeing that blacks are less employed because of racist whites greatly outnumber those who think blacks themselves are largely responsible for their own performance, by about ten to one. Disheartening.</p>
<p>2. It is perfectly acceptable to stereotype managers as out-of-touch &#8220;old fat white guys&#8221; who need to be taught a lesson.</p>
<p>3. A number of blacks expressed resentment that they were expected by their employers to be personable. &#8220;Grace&#8221;, who identifies herself as a black woman from Wisconsin, writes:</p>
<p> It has been my experience that white managers want to hire a certain type of black woman: the kind that makes white people feel comfortable around them. Now I try to get along with everyone but it is not in my personality to be the type that they want: which is gregarious/happy/naively optimistic/non-threatining/ commercially acceptable in hair and dress[&hellip;]</p>
<p>Grace doesn&rsquo;t seem to grasp the notion of the societal conventions that are often typical of the workplace and which everyone must conform to.  The presumption that one can act however one feels like in an office environment is probably one reason blacks aren&rsquo;t hired more often.</p>
<p>4. Most of the posts coming from self-identified black professionals had spelling and/or grammatical errors.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately,Lakisha and Jamal are LESS employable than their White counterparts. For a number of valid reasons. For example, the tendency of too many Blacks being shirkers and loafers. For a having a &#8220;could care less&#8221; attitude about the amount and quality of their work. For their automatic tendency to play the race card if reprimanded or told they have to shape up.</p>
<p>No, the people charged with doing the hiring will never admit the truths in my paragraph. But bet on it, those people will be thinking over these points when justifying the hiring of a White worker. At least, if a White worker is a bad hire, your firm doesn&rsquo;t get served with the automatic lawsuit if the drone gets fired.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Journal of Labor Economics found white, Asian and Hispanic managers tended to hire more whites and fewer blacks&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Employers also well know that if a black or other non-White does not work out it is impossible to get rid of them. Whites are 100% easier to fire.</p>
<p>I used to hear complaints on Larry Elder&rsquo;s old radio show by employers who were saddled for life with worthless blacks. The minute they tried to reprimand, write up or dismiss a black worker, the employer was called a racist and threatened with lawsuits from the EEOC, NAACP, and any other of the myriad organizations and their powerful lawyers that blindly support blacks.  The employers and/or business owners are terrified of losing their businesses, their homes and everything else they owned. </p>
<p>These litigious organizations play dirty, going for massive monetary damages and personal destruction at the same time.  There is no risk to those who are suing businesses, only large payoffs to line their own pockets and that of their &#8216;social justice&rsquo; shake-down organizations.</p>
<p>Employers want to avoid problems at all costs  &mdash;  same reason why handicapped employment is lower than it was before the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)  &mdash;  the threat of massive, business or career-ending lawsuits.</p>
<p>Better to hire Whites who make better employees in the first place and are less likely to file and win a punitive business-destroying settlement against you.</p>

		<p>Our government has really crippled American business by forcing them to hire those less than the best qualified. What would happen to a sports team if they used the same quota system? </p>
<p>The only way to compete is to find the best players and put togather the best team possible, team owners don&rsquo;t care if the players are black or white so long as they win.  The owners of American industry and business don&rsquo;t really care what color the workers are they only want the most productive work force they can get for the money spent. When we forced industry to take on less than qualified workers we started the decline of American business. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d be willing to BET that if the black college graduates had names like Robert and Diana they WOULD get just as many call backs as white college graduates.  When some mother tags her kids with names like Latisha and Deshong she is advertising her hatred of whites.  That&rsquo;s right.  The names were chosen specifically to be different than white names, indicating a hatred of all things white.  If I were going through a stack of hundreds of job applications, I&rsquo;d reject applicants who had names advertising themselves as trouble, as the product of a white hating home, and likely given the name, having attended a black college with lower standards, or affirmative action.</p>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t this the debate in California over college admissions?  Better-qualified Hsin and Ting were kept out of top-tier UC Berkeley so Lakisha and Jamal could attend?  </p>
<p>Many unqualified are admitted to college.  They are passed along because no professor, particularly in a time when teaching evaluations determine tenure, dares fails them.   So even if the student graduates with a degree in accounting, they may not know a debit from a credit.   Team projects are important so that qualified students can carry along the unqualified, just as they will in the workplace.</p>
<p>I suggest that this phenomenon is why recruiters now concentrate on hiring at the most selective schools, and ignore other colleges.  The intense screening to enter top-tier school means that these selective schools will have near-genius- and genius-level whites and Asians, and qualified blacks.   Any candidate interviewed will be able to function.  At lowest-tier colleges, anyone can earn a degree; however, employers have learned not to recruit there.   <br>

<p>Recent data shows that that 35% of people who earn degrees in Black Studies are White. In fact prior to the 1990s, the overwhelming majority of academics involved in the field of Black Studies esapecilly at the graduate levelwere White. </p>
<p>One reason for this was due to the very low number of Black earing Ph.D&rsquo;s. Even today the number of Black Ph.D. is much smaller than Blacks with JD&rsquo;s or MBA&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>Posters have mentioned a number of reasons that Blacks with degrees are less desirable to employers: affirmative action, low GPAs, the risk of lawsuits, the difficulty of firing Blacks, the lack of common manners displayed in interviews, or the silly names indication Afro-centric upbringing.  But I think that 10 WR and 12 Joe Shmoe have pointed out the most important reason, as well as the easiest for the NY Times to have checked if they cared to.  What department gave out these degrees?  A degree in African American Drama or Black Studies will be trumped by a degree in English or History.  A business degree beats a liberal arts degree, and a math, science, or computer degree is a more reliable indicator yet that the applicant is intelligent and has the power to reason.  These people are expecting to beat a full house with a pair of jacks.  </p>

		<p>Its a pretty safe bet that a very good number of black professionals and graduates got a big boost from A.A. In the real world of business you need people who can really make the cut. Customers and corporations know this. The government can only take social engineering so far. Imagine you need life-saving surgery. The doctor will be black or White, your pick. You KNOW its possible the black doctor may have gotten an A.A. pass. You also know that is innaplicable for the White surgeon. Which doctor are you going to go with?</p>

<p>It is interesting you should bring that up.  We have a black lady (and I mean a lady in the true meaning of the word) where I work.  Kindly, decent, friendly, and above all, she is highly competent at what she does.  I have worked with black Davids, Mikes, Georges, Loraines, and a Clarence or two.  Every one was anywhere from competent to stellar, and all were gentlemen.</p>
<p>One can hardly blame a child for the name a parent sticks them with.  But anyone who gives their name a name like L&rsquo;Shawn, or Laquisha will likely also not know, or care about, the basics of being a parent. </p>

<p>Not in the schools.</p>
<p>Many &#8216;teachers of color&rsquo; who teach English or History have degrees in either black or chicano studies.  If they do happen to have a degree in English, it is with an emphasis on black or chicano literature.  Then English teachers&rsquo; tests (for credentialing purposes) are ridiculously, embarrassingly easy  &mdash;  and the score needed to pass is very low.</p>
<p>Degrees in ethnic studies and in something called &#8216;Social Justice&rsquo; are highly sought after in the schools.  </p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;applicants with black-sounding names received 50 percent fewer callbacks than those with white-sounding names&hellip;</p>
<p>Because so many blacks make bad employees and represent a financial drag on a business:</p>
<p>Ed Rubenstien, writing for VDare.com estimates the &#8220;net costs of affirmative action programs at 8% of GDP ($1.1 trillion in 2007.) That implies a $1.1 trillion economic loss from affirmative action programs &mdash; a whopping $3,667 taken from every man, woman, and child in the country.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I teach at a two-year college.  Two weeks ago a black student athlete was attempting to bully me into guaranteeing him a D in an &#8220;Intermediate Algebra&#8221; course.  He was in quite an argumentative and belligerent state.  I finally told him that I didn&rsquo;t believe that his athletics status was my problem. His retort was, &#8220;Who&rsquo;s problem is it then?&#8221;  This is very typical of my daily interactions with black students.</p>
