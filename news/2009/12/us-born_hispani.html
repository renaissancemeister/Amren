<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-general/20091211/US.Young.Hispanics/">US-Born Hispanics See Gains in Education, Income</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Young Hispanics born in the U.S. are less likely to drop out of school and live in poverty than young Hispanic immigrants, but they have higher exposure to gangs and violence, an independent research group says.</p>
<p>The study being released Friday by the Pew Hispanic Center paints a mixed picture of assimilation for a fast-growing group of U.S. citizens starting to wield their political rights: more education and job advancement, but also social problems.</p>
<p>The survey and analysis of census data found the high school dropout rate among all Hispanic youths ages 16-24 was 17 percent, roughly three times higher than white youths and close to double the rate for black youths. But when broken down by second-generation Hispanics born in the U.S., the dropout rate falls to 8.5 percent, roughly the same for youths of all races.</p>
<p>U.S.-born Hispanics also had improvements in economic well-being. About 29 percent of young immigrant Hispanics lived below the poverty line, more than twice the rate for young whites in a similar age range (13 percent) and slightly worse than young blacks (28 percent). But among second-generation Hispanics, that figure living below the poverty line improves to 19 percent.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the American-born youths were twice as likely as their immigrant counterparts to have ties to a gang or to have gotten into a fight or carried a weapon in the past year. About 40 percent reported they were either a gang member or knew a friend or relative who was, compared to 17 percent for those who were foreign-born.</p>
<p>The U.S.-born Hispanics also were more likely to be in prison and perceive instances of racial discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In electoral terms, Latinos have had less clout at the polls than their numbers would suggest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their share of the electorate has not grown nearly as much as their share of the population,&#8221; said Paul Taylor, director of the Pew Hispanic Center. &#8220;Now, with the coming of age of this big generation of U.S.-born children of immigrants, that&rsquo;s all about to change.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other findings:</p>
<p>* Young Hispanic immigrants are less likely to be unemployed than their U.S.-born counterparts, but they are largely confined to lower-skill occupations such as food preparation and serving, grounds cleaning and maintenance and construction.</p>
<p>* Second-generation Hispanic women are less likely than immigrants to give birth as a teen, but rates are still high: 16 percent for second-generation women ages 18 and 19, compared to 26 percent for immigrants. In all, 26 percent of Hispanic women were mothers by the time they reached age 19. That&rsquo;s compared with 22 percent of blacks, 11 percent of whites and 6 percent of Asians.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* Three percent of Hispanic men ages 16 to 25 were in prison in 2008, compared with 7 percent of young black men and 1 percent of young white men. U.S.-born Hispanic young men were more likely than their foreign-born counterparts to be incarcerated  &mdash;  3 percent vs. 2 percent.</p>

		<p>I think the main reason why American-born Hispanics are gaining in education and income is because so many schools, both secondary and collegiate, hand them degrees and diplomas almost as if they were candy.  That does not make them any smarter.  Also, businesses and governments have affirmative action programs, and that&rsquo;s why Hispanics are gaining in income.  That doesn&rsquo;t make them any more competent.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hispanics less educated, more gang-connected, but gaining political power.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s worse news for blacks than it is for whites, make no mistake about it.  The black/Hispanic rivalries WILL get more intense, right along with more rioting, fighting, and murders.</p>
<p>This &#8220;people of color&#8221; unity is nothing but a farce created by black/Hispanic leaders in order to have more political power against whites.</p>
<p>If whites were not around to hate, they would be fighting each other more than they&rsquo;re doing now except all the stops would be pulled and the snarling non-white faces would be concentrating on each other.</p>

<p>Perhaps if these US-born Hispanics didn&rsquo;t drink themselves silly, associate with drug runners, wield machetes and automatic weapons, and tattoo themselves from head to toe they would be less likely to end up in prison and encounter racial discrimination.</p>

Late adolescence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time [minority students] reach grade 12, if they do so at all, minority students are about four years behind other young people. Indeed, 17 year-old African American and Latino students have skills in English, mathematics and science similar to those of 13-year-old white students.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well said Sir. </p>
<p>Another point never mentioned is when these young men and women get into the workforce, they&rsquo;ll refuse to do the menial labor their parents did, or are still doing. They&rsquo;ll be too &#8220;Americanized&#8221; for that. On the other hand, they&rsquo;re not so Americanized as to be able to function in this high tech society. There still remains that IQ imbalance. Further, they&rsquo;re not members of those societies their parents came from either.</p>
<p>Interesting situation these young people find themselves in. They&rsquo;re not in a happy situation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure this is because Mexicans who have just crossed the border are probably a bit on-edge and somewhat more grateful and humble. The ones who are born here start to lose their gratitude and humility and therefore become more resentful because they envy the power, wealth, beauty, culture, and class of white people.</p>

		<p>1 Q.D. and 4 Anon: It&rsquo;s true, those few Hispanics that actually graduate and pick up a public high school diploma are proudly walking of the stage with an eighth grade education.  That will get many of them into a four year college, where they will finally bog down and wonder why things got so hard.  Nothing to do but blame the Gringos and switch to Chicano Studies.  </p>

		<p>6 Anon: Ingratitude is right.  I have come to regret working so hard to teach the better sort of Hispanics.  I put my best into them, and they want to be Latinos or Chicanos instead of Americans, and think that Whites should move aside.  It is bitter to think that I wasted years trying to raise people who will only drag us down.  </p>

		<p>Question diversity (the first post) is dead on.  I work in such a school and district (major urban area).  The admin is 100% Latino while none of the teachers are.  About half of the teachers are under 25 and subscribe to that &#8220;social justice&#8221; thing, as well.  I see them passing (and praising) teenagers whose skills are not only atrocious in English (and math, science, etc) but who cannot even write coherently in Spanish!<br>
Those of us who grew up in the 70s and 80s (and who still remember how our country used to be) are appalled, but we&rsquo;re also scared for our jobs.  Any teachers who don&rsquo;t toe the line of &#8220;Pass! Pass! Pass! are quickly called &#8220;bad teachers&#8221; and gotten rid of.  That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s behind the &#8220;blame the teachers&#8221; game that Duncan, Rhee and others are trumpeting.  The teachers are actually better than ever, in terms of all the training they get, but the quality of the students coming to us is God-awful and gets worse every year.  Assign an essay?  You&rsquo;re lucky if 20% of your class does any homework of any kind.  America is doomed.  Nothing left to do but circle the wagons and tell your kids stories about how great countries fall and how great ours once was.</p>

		<p>American elections are every bit as fraudulent as those in Mexico.  </p>
<p>It has been noted that at political power comes from the barrel of a gun.  We have tens of millions of armed Americans about to exercise this power and wipe out any political gains made by Hispanics.  </p>
<p>There is a limit you know to how much abuse Americans will take from Hispanics and the politiians who pander to them&hellip;    </p>

<p>They are by and large &#8220;mestizos&#8221;. So sick of the &#8220;hispanic&#8221; label.</p>
<p>They are and will forever be a servant class borne of a conquered people, forever attracted to that which will ultimately destroy them&hellip;like moths to a flame. </p>
