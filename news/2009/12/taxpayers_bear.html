<h1>Taxpayers Bear the Burden As Refugee Resettlement Soars</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Don Barnett, Tennesseean, December 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This fiscal year, the U.S. resettled almost three times as many refugees as all the rest of the countries in the industrialized world combined.</p>
<p>Despite the recession, growing poverty, unemployment and homelessness, the U.S. resettled 75,000 refugees, the highest number of admissions since 9/11.</p>
<p>This is possible only because what was once the calling of true sacrificial charity and private sponsors is now the responsibility of the American taxpayer. Traditional sponsor duties have been replaced by access to welfare upon arrival for refugees and an opaque stream of grant money from seemingly every government agency except NASA.</p>
<p>In recent years up to 95 percent of the refugees coming to the U.S. were referred by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or were the relatives of U.N.-picked refugees. Until the late 1990s, the U.S. picked the large majority of refugees for resettlement in the U.S.</p>
<p>Considering that the refugee influx causes increases in all legal and illegal immigration as family and social networks are established in the U.S., the U.N. is effectively dictating much of U.S. immigration policy.</p>
<p>A nonprofit nation of hundreds of taxpayer-funded organizations has grown up around refugee resettlement in the U.S. A government-funded study finds &#8220;U.S. resettlement communities are awash with ECBOs that exist in name only but provide little meaningful assistance.&#8221; ECBO stands for Ethnic Community Based Organization, a government-defined category of grant recipients.</p>
<p>The expansion of the fraud-prone refugee program and the transformation of refugee resettlement into a federal contracting business have given birth to a global refugee industry well-adapted to the federal grant and contract environment.</p>
<p>Catholic Charities with its parent the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB ) is the largest refugee agency both nationally and in Nashville. It is neither a charity nor Catholic, but more an extension of a state welfare agency.</p>
<p>Sixty-five percent of Catholic Charities USA&rsquo;s $3.6 billion annual budget comes from government sources. Refugee resettlement, a relatively small portion of its services, is covered by the government at closer to 100 percent. For nonprofits, it is profitable to be in refugee resettlement, and the executive directors of some of the 10 major resettlement agencies make almost as much as the president of the United States.</p>
<p>Nashville Catholic Charities devotes about 26 percent of its budget to &#8220;immigrants and refugees,&#8221; an amazingly high percentage considering most of that aid is going to recent refugee arrivals  &mdash;  a fraction of 1 percent of Nashville&rsquo;s population. Interestingly, Tennessee recently put Nashville Catholic Charities in charge of distributing and monitoring federal &#8220;refugee&#8221; grant money to other NGOs in the state.</p>
<p>The possibility of a generous reception in the U.S. has created a &#8220;magnet effect&#8221; for refugees deciding between resettlement in the U.S. and integration in the region where they reside.</p>
<p>The once-independent faith-based and civic organizations have suffered their own &#8220;magnet effect,&#8221; causing a shift of efforts away from traditional works toward the more profitable refugee program. USCCB even lobbies for more business  &mdash;  that is, for higher refugee admission quotas.</p>
<p>Incentives built into refugee resettlement are behind much of its growth, especially as refugees themselves enter the federal contracting and lobbying business.</p>

		<p>A majority of these refugees come from countries or regions where the United States has been militarily involved in recent times.  This is why I&rsquo;m opposed to foreign adventurism, especially when the Republocrats are in power.</p>

		<p>By what ethical standard does resettlement of refugees in the US, with all its economic and ethnic problems, make sense?</p>
<p>These African and other nations need to solve their own problems. Offer USA or Europe as a solution to African incompetence, and the incompetence will expand by a factor too large to calculate.</p>
<p>If anything, we have &#8220;refugees&#8221; a plenty already in our nation who should be deported. By that reference, I mean blacks who are incapable of supporting themselves, all illegal immigrants, and &#8220;green&#8221; card holders who have displaced American workers.</p>
<p>Russia and China don&rsquo;t put up with this refugee nonsense. Why should the US of A?</p>

		<p>Non-White refugees&hellip;more democratic voters to force NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS to subsidize their race replacement a the hands of post-1965 hispanics,somalis, muslims and asians. What a neat trick&hellip;and very diabolical I must add. Only a nation of White imbeciles-consumers of sports entertainment- would allow this to happen. </p>
<p>That the Democratic party is waging a vicious race war against NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS is obvious.</p>

<p>In the big scheme of things, 75,000 is a drop in the bucket.  Third-world birth rates are off the charts, and will only get worse.  There are millions and millions more &#8220;refugees&#8221; queued up to come to the land of milk and honey.</p>

		<p>You are so right Jupiter in your comments on Amren.</p>
<p> WE are paying Catholic Charities to being even more of the 3rd world here to displace us from our OWN land! This has been planned for decades now and the 1965 Immigration Act clinched it. Don&rsquo;t forget the Lutheren Church also does the same. Even the Baptists are on board now. This is one reason I quit going to these fake churches and will never give them a cent! Makes one wonder what enemy infiltrated these churches? </p>

		<p>Agree with above. There needs to be someone accountable for the cabal that is deliberately using USA immigration, refugees &amp; asylum for massive immigrant displacement of real Americans. RICO comes to mind. Criminal acts forcing taxation without representation upon US is criminal. <br/>
Those responsible have created an elaborate network of lawyers for hire to evade the costs of sponsorship.  All organzations arranging the import of immigrants need to sponsor/pay directly.  No government office, agency or taxpayer funded grant should be going to immigration cabal.  This is criminal.   V</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you who could use some refugee resettlement - White South Africans.  But I&rsquo;m afraid Europe, the U.S., and Canada will turn their back on them (the liberal brainwashed governments of the West will probably reason that they deserve it for all those years of apartheid).  I&rsquo;m really afraid for what the future holds for them.  </p>

		<p>The time is rapidly approaching when the federal government runs out of money and is forced to shutdown.</p>
<p>The method by which they originate new money by borrowing and leveraging has broken down.  Now, if they want more money they have to tax it.  Unlike europe, where they are content to put up with 90% taxation (as just became a reality in britain for alot of people), the US does not put up with that.  </p>
<p>In fact, one could argue convincingly that our current economic situation is nothing more than businesses refusing to invest and create new jobs simply because they worry about new taxes under Obama.  The ultimate tax avoidance is to not make money.</p>
<p>The point is this.  Once the fed is no longer pumping out money to pay for stuff like this, those &#8220;resettled&#8221; people are going to have to move on or starve.</p>

		<p>   Resentment soars but the policy continues. Even with ten percent unemployment our privileged elite&rsquo;s obsession with transforming the country into a mostly non white Third World nation shows no sign of abating. If anything, there is a renewed emphasis on &#8220;shamnasty&#8221; by the Obama administration.  </p>

		<p>Since this country seems to offer an unending supply of funds to all countries (guilt trip?), do we still need to &#8220;resettle&#8221; their citizens here too? If we&rsquo;re intent on making this a country of &#8220;squabbling nationalities&#8221; let&rsquo;s cut out the money giveaway.<br/>
Mexico has money headed for the pockets of the government/drug lords/elite (all the same), yet we&rsquo;re still expected to take in 15% of their population? Why? When will our leader get some guts and tell the world they can&rsquo;t have it both ways. It&rsquo;s acting like we still have the means to do this, when we can&rsquo;t even employ our own millions who are out of work.</p>

<p>Just like aid to hopeless Africa, which has enriched many a black leader&rsquo;s Swiss bank account and provided income to half of million employees of aid institutions and associated contractors (see the book &#8220;Dead Aid&#8221;), this refugee industry is another drain on taxpayers our sorry politicians allow for the special- interest campaign donations &amp; votes they get. Naturally they claim it&rsquo;s for human interests &amp; wonderful diversity. Politics as usual under Obama.</p>

<p>The rot runs very deep in the Christian Curches. Two years ago, on a Saturday morning-Christmas time- I was in a Carrabu coffee shop in NC. Two Southern White women from the area deeply involved in their Evangelical Church<br/>
sat down next to me. For one hour, they yapped away enthusiastically about the churches asian and hispanic outreach program. One of them stated emphatically that these minority outreach programs are   crucial for this particular Evangelical Christian Church&rsquo;s future growth. Like I said, the rot runs very deep and it is necrotic.</p>
<p>The Christian Churches in America have to be defunded. The $$$$ that you normally give at collection time should be sent to America Renassaince-not to numbersusa.com either. The Christian Churches will get the message.</p>

		<p>I have heard it said that the real reason mass immigration is encouraged is economic. That is, the central banking complex must generate more currency than it lends to the federal government because it is lending to it at interest; extra dollars printed are to be circulated through the economy and eventually wind their way back to the treasury as taxation. This margin of extra dollars inevitably means inflation; the only way the inflationary pressure can be eased is to import more consumers (read immigrants) who &#8220;soak up&#8221; the currency and slow down the inflationary tide. The problem is the immigrants being imported are not the savvy consumers and producers the fed is hoping would come. Thus the delay in the reckoning isn&rsquo;t as protracted as to be wished. The health care programs we are creating and paying for are rank testimony to the poverty and illness coming our way via immigration. The same scenario is playing out in the UK. I don&rsquo;t know what the endgame for our Anglophone world is going to be but I sense widespread dread amongst the Americans I talk with.</p>

		<p>When I attended Catholic schools years ago, we used to have special events where someone from a 3rd world country came and spoke about the people in need in their country. This naturally culminated in asking for donations to care for the &#8216;pagan babies&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The point was that they money would be spent over there to help them. Never did anyone talk about using the money to bring them here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when this all changed but Catholic Charities has become an organization that shouldn&rsquo;t be funded with tax money.</p>
<p>In this instance, I&rsquo;m all for a wall of separation. Where are the liberals demanding this funding be ended?</p>

		<p>The only refugees this country should admit are the whites from South Africa and the once-beautiful country of Rhodesia.</p>
<p>Their &#8220;crime&#8221; was to create productive and bountiful countries out of nothing more than wilderness, providing jobs, opportunities, and a modern standard of living for people who had never so much as discovered the wheel, let alone developed a written language.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re in danger of being overrun and slaughtered by the black populations, who, with stunning alacrity, are discarding all the trappings of civilization and returning to a state of basest tribal mentality.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect this or any other nation to intervene in the slaughter of the whites, however. Our political class will have us believe that they&rsquo;re just getting their just deserts.</p>

<p>&gt; A good set of insights for continuing discussion.</p>
<p>I think it is largely that the RCC wants more Catholics in America.  As history demonstrates, they are good at adapting their behaviors and programs, allying with any form of government, except church denying communism, that arrives on the scene, including Nazism (Read: &#8220;The Holy Reich&#8221;).</p>
<p>But make no mistake, the Protestants are working at it as well.  The Lutheran Church works hard to bring in non-whites and just received recognition for their &#8220;work.&#8221;  Even the Baptists, Pentecostals, Mormons, and Jehovah Wintesses have missions abroad and work to gain assylum for all they convert.  Recently, in Oregon we saw a set of Ukrainian parents on trial for child abuse.  It seems their interpretation of their Baptist Christianity led them to beat their daughter for cutting her hair.  </p>
<p>La Raza gets tax money, so do a number of religious charity groups.  The Democrats hope to gain votes through Catholic immigration and the Republicans through Protestant immigration, both abusing the same asylum laws.  It is like a race to replace a secularized or religiously lethargic American public and set the stage for new wars of religion.  This is not the scenario leading to white racial survival that I hope for or desire.  For one thing, the success of any is difficult to guarantee.</p>

		<p>Mark (comment #17), the reason is not economic. That&rsquo;s what the propaganda angle is, but anyone who stops to think about this for a moment realizes the economic argument is completely dead in the water. How does a group of low IQ, largely illiterate (and that includes functional illiteracy in their own Spanish language) individuals drive a first world economy to growth? We at AmRen all know that illegal immigration is a net cost to us (to the figure of billions of dollars - and this is only the economics). They don&rsquo;t pay taxes and they don&rsquo;t pay into social security, but they are eligible for all kinds of benefits and of course, free medical care at our expense. They will not magically become net contributors if/when they are legalized, either (even our current, legal lower classes are net takers, not net contributors). They send billions in remittances back home to Mexico and elsewhere. Again, where is the benefit?</p>
<p>There is no benefit. None, at all. The real agenda of the elites is divide and conquer. It&rsquo;s rather brilliant, ultimately; you have to hand it to them. The most potent enemy of such a plan is a united populace. So, to make us easily controllable, divide us. Drive divisions between women and men (feminism). Drive divisions between racial groups (&#8220;affirmative action&#8221; and mass immigration). The rank-and-file constituents of these groups are just useful idiots for the elites, who know perfectly well what they are doing to our country, and to most of the West. These useful idiots will be discarded when it becomes convenient.</p>

		<p>Yeah, I would also say the reason for mass immigration is not economic in a improving the economy sense.  It&rsquo;s about destroying the middle class and having in it&rsquo;s place an underclass which is given money crumbs by the elites in government and the bankers while the elites/bankers run the show.  This trend is accelerating under the Obama regime with more government control over private industry and fraudulent schemes such as global warming.</p>
<p>The thing which may put a major kink in their plans though is the precarious state of U.S. government debt and trade.  The dollar and all currencies are essentially empty promises with more paper promises backing them.  Some countries such as China know that we can&rsquo;t possibly pay back our debts and they are slowly transitioning away from their dollar reserves and buying gold/silver and conducting transactions in other currencies other than the dollar.</p>
<p>Other Western nations currencies and debt situations are also a joke and the U.S. basically has limited options.  Get frugal and pay off the debt, default on the debt or try and inflate it away. Know doubt, they will try to inflate it away, i.e. print money which may lead to hyperinflation.</p>

		<p> To be a white democrat you have to be out of your mind. This party never stands up for white people only for the people that hate us. Yet a sizable chunk of white people will vote for them. Only hope is that voters will wake up to this fact and toss every democrat out of office. Then all you would be stuck with are useless Republicans. Oh my!</p>
