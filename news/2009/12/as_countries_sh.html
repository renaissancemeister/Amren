<h1>As Countries Shut Out Migrants, Canada Warned It Will Become the New Safe Harbour</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Friesen, Globe and Mail (Toronto), December 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The worst recession in a generation has already played havoc with the job market, housing prices and the banking system. Now it&rsquo;s doing the same with something else: the worldwide movement of people.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s wealthiest nations, from Japan to Spain to Australia, are cutting immigration targets to protect fragile labour markets and encouraging itinerant workers to leave. Only Canada has refused to adjust immigration levels in response to the downturn.</p>
<p>This outlier status has led to concern among border officials that the country&rsquo;s sympathetic refugee system and generous social programs will make it a prime target for migrants rejected elsewhere.</p>
<p>A government intelligence document described as sensitive and not for public distribution warns that more migrants from Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America could opt to come to Canada rather than Western Europe or the United States. The report refers to both legal applicants and those who try to enter illegally.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re planning for the economic recovery. Cutting immigration levels is a short-term measure,&#8221; said Alykhan Velshi, spokesman for Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney. At the same time, Mr. Velshi said, Canada must guard against those who would try to enter illegally.</p>
<p>Asylum claims in Canada increased dramatically in 2008, and were on pace for another increase in 2009 until visa restrictions were slapped on travellers from Mexico and the Czech Republic, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Individuals who may not be fleeing persecution are drawn to Canada because of our overly generous asylum system,&#8221; Mr. Velshi said. Human trafficking rings in Canada and the Czech Republic, for example, were encouraging people to make refugee claims in Canada, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is something we have to take very seriously.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We can&rsquo;t allow the creation of a two-tier immigration system: one tier for people who wait patiently and legally in the queue to come to Canada and another for profiteers, for those who engage the services of snakeheads and human trafficking groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trigger for the shift in migration patterns and immigration policy is the domino-effect in labour markets unleashed by the recession, the report says. Unemployment is expected to rise to 10 per cent in developed countries and could stay that high for up to eight years, it states. Those at the bottom of the wage scale, and those with temporary status, or none at all, in their host countries are likely to be among the first and most severely affected.</p>
<p>As jobs disappear, host countries are lowering immigration quotas to trim welfare rolls and quell potential anti-immigrant feeling. They&rsquo;re also bolstering immigration enforcement. Authorities in Italy and Spain, for example, have redoubled their efforts to expel undocumented workers and prevent boatloads of African migrants from reaching their shores. Japan announced plans to send home 400,000 South Americans of Japanese heritage to ease its labour market strain. Spain has returned 300,000 migrants and paid 6,000 others a special supplement to leave the country. Australia reduced its intake targets by nearly 15 per cent.</p>
<p>The report, produced by the Canada Border Services Agency, was obtained by immigration lawyer Richard Kurland through access to information. Mr. Kurland said the document shows that the wisest path is to further integrate the temporary foreign workers already in Canada and not reduce immigration.</p>
<p>The document forecasts unrest in the migrants&rsquo; home countries that could create a complicated feedback loop of migration issues. Migrants send their families about $283-billion a year, and when remittances from some countries dry up, poverty will be exacerbated, which in turn can destabilize the population and encourage more people to seek any route to a well-paying job. Desperation could lead more people to human smugglers and organized crime, it says.</p>
<p>&#8220;The knee-jerk reaction is to yank the welcome mat and this internal intelligence report clearly shows that&rsquo;s not the way to go.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You&rsquo;re going to be exporting political instability by exporting workers into regions already fragile politically and economically. It will inevitably hasten their decline,&#8221; Mr. Kurland said. &#8220;In the short term, protecting foreign workers who are already in Canada is the gateway to future economic growth.&#8221;<br>

		<p>As a Canadian I am saddened and dismayed by this article. Seemingly every violent crime in Canada is perpetrated by recent immigrants from Asia, Africa, or eastern Europe. The easiest thing in the world to do is to claim refugee status in Canada. </p>
<p><em>Migrants send their families about $283-billion a year, and when remittances from some countries dry up, poverty will be exacerbated, which in turn can destabilize the population and encourage more people to seek any route to a well-paying job.</em></p>
<p>That much money flowing out of the country cannot be good for the economy. And what of the plight of generational Canadians? Will the government compensate them for reduced economic opportunities and increased victimization of crimes?</p>
<p>Canada, if the rest of the civilized world is downsizing its immigration quotas during these difficult economic time, then, perhaps, it may be a prudent action, and as a nation, we should follow suit.</p>

		<p>Canadians have been clear for years regarding mass third-world immigration - STOP! </p>
<p>We neither want, nor need, large numbers of Chinese, Africans, East Indians and other assorted tribes to come here and &#8220;enrich&#8221; our culture as liberals so deprecatingly call it. Rather, looking at each of these countries obvious lack of success, we&rsquo;d rather not, thank you. If there&rsquo;s any improving to be done in Canada, gosh darn it, we&rsquo;ll just have to do it ourselves, without these geniuses. </p>
<p>Liberals like to tell us that we&rsquo;re the poorer for not allowing more Bangladeshi&rsquo;s into Canda. What nonsense. Bangladesh is poor because Bangladeshi&rsquo;s live there. Africa is poor because Africans live there&hellip; and by the way&hellip; Jamaica is poor because Africans live there too.. and parts of Toronto, which are now poor and dangerous. It is said that &#8220;the truth shall set you free!&#8221;, but this couldn&rsquo;t possibly apply to liberals who, upon reading this, shall duly set their hair on fire and bang their heads on their prayer mats in the direction of Ottawa. Good!</p>
<p>Cheers, and Merry Christmas y&rsquo;all</p>

While I empathize with the plight of Canadians, I&rsquo;m troubled by the first paragraph.</p>
<p>The dip in &#8216;migration&rsquo; is clearly only a lull. When economies recover, I&rsquo;ll bet the new line we&rsquo;re going to get is that we have to bring in even more to catch up to where we should be and that since the recession hit the poorest nations the hardest, we have to relieve their suffering and bring them here.</p>
<p>Canada is a vast land mass to population. But even so, there is always a tipping point where input will overwhelm social services. Any theorized benefits of &#8216;migrant populations&rsquo; will eventually be negated by the cost of maintaining non-productive, angry, hostile, ignorant populations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a losing game.<br>

		<p>The $283 billion is remittances sent to their home countries by migrant workers in all developed countries combined. Only $1.5 to 2 billion is sent as gifts from individuals in Canada to outside of Canada per year.</p>

		<p>I wonder why slavery was renamed human trafficking. Maybe because victims of human trafficking sounds better than slaves. Saying that Canada has slaves kind of spoils the image we&rsquo;re trying to show the world.</p>
<p>I also notice an immigration lawyer is talking about economic growth. Does he have qualifications to do that? </p>

<p>As usual, they&rsquo;ve got it completely backwards; it&rsquo;s immigration that is a short-term measure.  Even if their claims about immigration helping the economy are correct, is not the destruction of a nation an excessive price to pay to help the economy?  Taken at face value, all Western governments care about is money.  The truth is far more sinister; all they truly care about is the power to destroy their own societies.</p>

		<p>Oh my God! I live in Canada, and I can tell you that it already seemed like we were the trashcan of the whole immigration, sometimes&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s life in Canada goig to be like, now? I mean, Third World immigrants, because of certain laws we have here, can recreate their Third World way of life here, already.</p>

		<p>The asylum seekers who come to Canada from Czech republic are gypsies. Just to clarify that. And you can be sure they&rsquo;re not trying to escape anything. They&rsquo;re just parasites who know what a good life they&rsquo;ll have in Canada without having to lift a finger. They&rsquo;re moving to Britain as well. But isn&rsquo;t it surprising none of them are &ldquo;escaping&rdquo; to Africa? I wonder why.</p>

<p>In my travels around the world and in Western countries, I see no evidence of curtailing immigration, legal OR illegal. The U.S. and other civilized countries are being hardest hit because of the generous welfare give aways we have. End those things, crime rate goes up even higher and more ruthlessly and many more White&rsquo;s eyes will open. France is controlled in it&rsquo;s entirety as nearly as I can tell by African muslims, England appears to be controlled by Pakistanis and Bangles.</p>

		<p>Those of us to the south should thank Canada and empathize with the non-liberal, non-pol Canadians.  They provide a very accurate barometer as to the effects of liberal lunacy to us down south a full decade prior to our own foolish emulation.  Public health care debate?  Look north to see how public health is truly.  Hate crime laws?  Look north to see the extent and partiality as to it&rsquo;s application.  Homo anti-discrimination?  Look north to see how your pastors and Christian bibles will be treated shortly.  Needing a microcosm laboratory empirical example as to how an ethnic presence disrupts lawful society?  Canada used to be entirely European in demographics before their liberal traitors allowed third world invaders.  The only crime you find in Canada for the most part is ONLY done by the third world invaders, or by the indigenous native population.  Problem is, nobody down here is paying attention, and our politicians already know all this already and don&rsquo;t care.  They will impose it on us, as soon as they can.  The tune &#8220;a parcel of rogues in a nation&#8221; keeps going through me head more and more lately.</p>
