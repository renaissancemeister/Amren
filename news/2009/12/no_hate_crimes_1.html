<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the early morning hours of November 15, Kent State University student Christopher Kernich was walking home with two friends after a party. As the three walked down the sidewalk, a car carelessly pulled out of a parking lot, narrowly missing the students. The driver then pulled into a driveway and waited for them, both the driver and passenger then jumped from the vehicle and allegedly attacked the young men.</p>
<p>Kernich took a particularly hard beating, and according to witnesses, was kicked in the head several times by Kelly and Barker as he lie in the street. Members of the nearby fraternity where Kernich had just attended a party, saw the attack and rushed to help.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fraternity members held the attackers until police arrived.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On November 21, Christopher Kernich succumbed to his injuries. The Summit County medical examiner has confirmed that his death was caused by blunt force trauma to the head, which caused uncontrollable swelling in the brain.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>*Reporter&rsquo;s note: There was no robbery involved, and the two groups of young men did not know one another. So, when a deadly attack occurs for no apparent reason, one has to look a little deeper for a motive, such as race.</p>
<p>The attackers in this case, were black, while the victims were white. While that fact is seemingly being overlooked by the police as well as most of those reporting on the horrific incident, race-fueled hatred may present the only possible motivating factor to cause two men to stomp on the head of a total stranger, until the man&rsquo;s brain explodes.</p>
<p>While I personally find hate crime laws to be absurd, if this standard is to be applied in this country, then it must be applied equally. However, we have seen time and time again, that it is certainly not applied equally.</p>
<p>Given the fact that our current Attorney General has himself, expressed his approval for the unfair way in which the law is applied, we can expect to see more hypocrisy on this matter in the near future.</p>
<p>In June 2009, during his testimony before a Senate panel considering new hate crimes legislation, Attorney General Eric Holder made it very clear that any new laws passed would not apply to white victims. When Sen. Jeff Sessions pressed Holder into saying exactly who would be protected under such laws, Holder gave his opinion that only those who have been subjected to &#8220;the unfortunate history of our nation,&#8221; should receive the added protection.<br/>
