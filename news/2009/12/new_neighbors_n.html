	<p>Russia is disappearing. So is Japan. Europe is next to go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the rising waters of global warming that threaten these parts of the world. The problem is more basic. The Russians and Japanese, as well as large numbers of Europeans, are not having enough children to replace themselves. The birth rates across a large swath of Eurasia are considerably below the replacement rate of 2.1 babies.</p>
<p>To prevent further shrinkage, many of these countries have instituted policies that encourage reproduction, such as more generous family leave and better child care. While such policies are essential regardless of a country&rsquo;s fertility rate, they are not going to solve the disappearing country problem. Birth rates continue to remain very low in Taiwan (1.14), South Korea (1.21), Japan (1.21), Ukraine (1.26), Poland (1.28), and Italy (1.31). In the 1970s, only 24 countries had birth rates of 2.1 or less. Today, over 70 countries fall into this category.</p>
<p>Pushing for another baby boom is also globally irresponsible. At a time of climate and energy crises, the earth simply can&rsquo;t take on too many more passengers. Women bearing children in the industrialized world, in particular, have an enormous impact on global warming: American women having babies generate seven times the carbon output of Chinese women having babies.</p>
<p>The solution lies not in the greater production of people but in their more equitable distribution. The answer to the disappearing country problem is immigration. Birth dearth countries already rely heavily on foreign workers to meet their labor shortage. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be easy to persuade Russians to welcome large numbers of Chinese into Siberia or Italy to embrace more Nigerians. The rancorous immigration debate in America demonstrates that fear and xenophobia can overwhelm practical considerations even in immigration nations. Demography, however, is destiny. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} We urgently need a migration summit to coordinate immigration policies, improve the integration of migrants, and address the inevitable xenophobic backlash.</p>

		<p>So the white population of the world is slightly decreasing.  Whites created very livable societies for themselves when there were three-fourths of the number of whites as there are now, and they will continue to do so when we&rsquo;re down to that fraction of what we are now.  In fact, one of the intangible benefits will be that crowded cities in Europe are slightly less so.</p>
<p>But the big hitch is the forced dispossession of whites in their own countries, at the hands of their own elites, by importing legal or illegal non-whites.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather live in a United States with 150 million white people comprising 99% of the total people in the country than one with 300 million white people who only comprise 50% of all the people therein.</p>

<p>Does he think the Chinese or other people are like fuel efficient vehicles? </p>
<p>The reason the carbon imprint of Americans is higher than Chinese is because of the lifestyle in America. </p>
<p>If you transplant a million Chinese people into the US their carbon footprint will increase to 7 times of what it was in China so that doesn&rsquo;t help the environmental argument for immigration as opposed to local births.</p>

		<p>The problem is that advanced societies create feminism and feminism lowers birth rates.  We don&rsquo;t need more Third Worlders in the West and West-like; we need more Westernism in Africa, central Asia, Latin America, etc.<br>

		<p>This decline in population in Japan and many White nations is not actually a problem, because (1) population decline has many benefits, and (2) it is only temporary.  </p>
<p>Reduced population levels reduce competition for scarce resources, including housing, jobs, water, food, energy, road and parking space, etc.  For example, if the USA population were to suddenly drop by 90%, then 90% of houses would be empty, and basically free.  Likewise, we would no longer need to import oil, because we could easily satisfy our energy needs from our domestic supply.  Every city and farming community would suddenly have excess water.  Because factories, farmland, forests, mining, fisheries, and tourism industries would need to replace workers, there would be full employment at high wages.  Fewer prisoners, students and patients would reduce government spending, lowering taxes.  Full employment would not only reduce the need for expensive social-welfare programs (further lowering government spending), but would increase tax revenues.   </p>
<p>The resulting high wages, booming economy, and lowered cost of living and lowered tax burden would allow Americans for the first time in decades, to relax and enjoy life more, work less, and have larger families.  Daily commutes would shorten, because everyone could live close to work,  Freeways would be empty. There would be less stress and more time.  Currently, White Americans simply cannot afford to have children, because they need to put all of their energies into achieving financial security and building their careers.  The high tax rate keeps White Americans poor, and they simply cannot risk having children.  Dramatically lowered populations will reset the dynamics toward larger families.  Hence, lowered population levels are only temporary.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, NONE OF THE ABOVE WILL COME TRUE, IF DURING THE TEMPORARY REDUCTION IN POPULATION LEVEL, AMERICA&rsquo;S POPULATION IS REPLACED BY THIRD WORLD PEOPLE.  THERE IS NO FUTURE FOR WHITE AMERICANS IF OUR GOVERNMENT REPLACES US VIA MASSIVE IMMIGRATION.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The answer to the disappearing country problem is immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>No.  The answer is to PREVENT immigration.  Immigration, combined with a low native birthrate, will simply replace the native population with a third-world one.  In the end, Italy (for example) would be another Nigeria, with high crime, high corruption, low literacy and a high birthrate.  Furthermore, the world will lose diversity because there will be no more Italy.  What this author is suggesting is the replication of high-birthrate countries within what used to be low-birthrate countries.  That makes no sense at all.  By promoting immigration, we are telling Nigerians that it&rsquo;s alright to have as many babies as they want because their excess children can simply be exported to Italy.  By preventing immigration, we would be forcing nations like Nigeria to limit their own population.  As for Italy, without replacement immigration, it would eventually rebound.</p>

		<p>Gee, more Marxist/Leftist twaddle dressed up as environmentalism - what a shocker! Funny how one never needs to look very far beneath the surface of this whole &#8220;climate change&#8221; scheme to locate those old familiar themes so populr with the Left. This movement is so transparent and obvious in its aims, even the most obtuse should have seen through this charade by now.   </p>

		<p>Everyone should pay close attention to this article in Epoch Times, a Chinese publication.</p>
<p>It is a myth that is gaining currency that the West isn&rsquo;t reproducing enough, and will welcome with open arms billions of Asians. As the popularity of this belief grows, Asians are listening for dissent, but not hearing any from whites.  </p>
<p>Asians have no fear of us, and conclude that we in the West are indifferent to the future. They believe this is the start of a rennaissance for Asians, and that a bonanza of land and wealth is up for grabs in the New World, first come, first served.</p>
<p>Until we start saying different, they&rsquo;ll continue to believe we&rsquo;ve left the front door of our house open, and are asking them to move in. </p>

		<p>This is a vile article.  White children cost 7 times as much carbon as chinese children?  Who thinks like this?  When did we start judging the worth of human beings by how much carbon they emit?</p>
<p>Not only is global warming a manufactured scandal   &mdash;   the worst case global warming scenario isn&rsquo;t nearly as bad as the death of Europe he&rsquo;s sitting there gleefully discussing   &mdash;   but he completely rules out any other solution to reducing carbon emissions save genocide of the white race.  Whites shouldn&rsquo;t have any more babies, not a single more baby, for the rest of time, because we simply emit too much carbon.  Who thinks like this?  What happened to putting up windmills or using carbon-capture coal mines or planting trees?  Why did global warming suddenly require the global genocide of the white race?</p>
<p>Furthermore, why does he immediately assume that anyone opposed to immigration is a &#8216;xenophobe,&rsquo; ie, has an irrational fear of foreigners.  What country has benefited from the immigrants it already has taken in?  Can he point to any successful nigerian immigrant success stories in the past that would lead him to believe that they would be the ideal new population of Italy?  If all evidence and all history say African immigrants are bad for the native population, why is it irrational to not desire them to race replace your country?</p>
<p>Basically, there is no attempt at argument in this article, no attempt at logic.  He simply makes conclusions, without any support   &mdash;   and the conclusion he magically comes to is for whites to cease having babies while welcoming the entire world to take their land and their countries from them forevermore.  This is a naked call for genocide.  The proffered reasons for this conclusion are absurd, so we must imagine that the only real reason he wrote this claptrap is pure hatred.  I call his hatred and raise him two-fold.</p>
<p>If there is any justice in the world, someday this article will come back to haunt Mr. John Feffer.</p>

		<p>What insanity will they come up with next concerning the evil White devils? This is a ploy to try to convince White nations to import millions more blacks and browns. We would have more babies if it weren&rsquo;t for what the enemy did to our nations to begin with! What White couple wants to bring White babies in our OWN nations anymore? They see that their own children won&rsquo;t have a chance in a minority ruled America. Start deporting and close down ALL immigration and build those walls on our borders and even repatriate millions of those here since the unconstitutional 1965 Immigration Act was rammed down our throats!</p>

<p>This proves that we don&rsquo;t need anymore immigrants. As a matter of fact we need to send some back where they came from. Once immigrants come to America they are counted as American because there children will wish to live as Americans and cosume seven times the energy they would back in  their home countries. </p>
<p>As far as energy consumption and carbon output goes it doesn&rsquo;t matter if an American is born here or imported from a foreign land. To keep anything near the past quality of life we need to reduce the number of American citizens, which would happen without immigration. </p>

		<p>Just so people realize, the Epoch Times is a propaganda rag owned and operated by the Fau Lon Gong movement, a new age Chinese cult constituting of a dab of yoga, a dash of Buddhism, which  was founded in like the 1990s for the main purpose of the enrichment of its founders and is something along the lines of an Asian version of Scientology. </p>
<p>That being said the argument is pretty absurd. The only way mass importation of high fertility immigrants to the industrialized worlds and replacement of evil whiteys would help &#8220;global warming&#8221; (if global warming in fact existed) would be if they retained their primitive life styles and lived in huts, practiced subsitence farming etc.</p>
<p>Whites seem the only ones even remotely interested in environmentalism, others only if it involves other issues like &#8220;green jobs&#8221; or situations where they smell a legal pay out with stuff like &#8220;environmental racism!&#8221; which means building like a powerplant or something near the ghetto.</p>

<p>My, my, but Comrade Feffer here seems somewhat out of touch with current events, when making his arguments for a Western genocide. Has he not heard of Climategate yet?</p>
<p>In the end, when the genocide of whites is the goal, what difference does it make? It is the alpha and omega of current multicultural political thought, that requires nether rationality or the truth in drawing its monstrously homicidal conclusions. For example, it never dawns on these people that simply allowing &ldquo;immigrants&rdquo; into a Western country from the Third World, doesn&rsquo;t reduce resource and energy expenditures, it exacerbates it. This would be because while these Third World &ldquo;enriches&rdquo; do not share our education and values concerning these more globally responsible matters that Comrade Feffer is dwelling on, they do reflect a desire to become direct reflections of our more comfortable way of life and conspicuous consumption behaviors. </p>
<p>Or put another way, making new Americans either through procreation or immigration, logically leads to the same outcomes that Comrade Feffer is wringing his hands over.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>One wonders, what will it take to convince the over-reproducing countries to lower their reproduction rates if they can just take land and resources from the population under-reproducers?</p>
<p>Apparently, Feffer thinks they ought not to have to suffer the consequences of their bad decisions. Why? What sort of person is this Feffer?</p>
<p>At the very least, he&rsquo;s irresponsible, and more probably he&rsquo;s an anti-white globalist intent on the destruction of first world societies. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll happily advocate immigration to certain non-white countries (Taiwan, Japan) as a form of PC &#8220;camoflage&#8221; as long as he can continue to advocate inflicting multicultural damage on white countries. Of course, those non-white countries have much too much good sense to ever listen to somebody like Feffer.</p>
<p>This is not the sort of person who should be listened to by anybody, certainly not by any white person who cares about his or her children or their future. </p>

		<p>Is anyone else a little baffled by the author&rsquo;s logic?</p>
<p>It goes something like this: People in industrialized countries exert a huge toll on the environment and should lower their numbers. Immigrants from underdeveloped countries, who exert a much lower toll on the environment, should immigrate to industrialized countries to sustain the population.</p>
<p>The obvious consequence of such a course is that immigrants will begin to exert a much larger toll on the environment and perhaps even match the people whom they are replacing. Moreover, immigrants tend to have much larger families than natives, so immigration is actually more harmful to the environment than no immigration.<br>

		<p>ONCE AND FOR ALL.  Birth rates, like global warming, happen in natural cycles.  The global white birthrates is down because it happens that whites have, as a matter of physical survival, been forced to congregate into expensive, racially homogeneous areas that have us too exhausted financially to have large families.  We shoulder the bulk of the tax burden, we make up the majority of casualties in war, and we prefer that our children have a higher quality of life than that of a large littler of sewer rats.  This in no way obligates us to just hand over our ancestral homelands and the nations that we built and fought and died for, to alien races who&rsquo;s chief accomplishment is wide hips and uncontrolled libido.  And maybe John Feffer, since he is so concerned about &#8220;rancorous fear and xenophobia&#8221; against Nigerians, should put his money where his mouth is and put up several Nigerian families in his own house.</p>

		<p>I cannot understand this obsession with population growth. That&rsquo;s one of the exact reasons Third World countries are as such; unbridled reproduction. White, European socities are naturally rescinding their birth rates to maintain their resources and standards of living. Damned fool politicians and do-gooders just don&rsquo;t get that&hellip;.For the politicians it&rsquo;s, &#8220;Growth, growth, growth!&#8221; and an potential voter base. For the do-gooders it&rsquo;s, &#8220;Let&rsquo;s share with those less fortunate and level the playing field.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, some stupid politician commented not long ago, in regards to immigration, that &#8220;New Jersey has the populaion density of India, and it&rsquo;s doing just fine.&#8221; pandering for the immigrant vote.</p>
<p>Our forefathers worked like dogs and made tremendous sacrifices to create our great Euro-American nations. I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m watching us hand it all over to hostile minorities and foreigners.</p>

		<p>I think the theory that nonwhite people who go to First World countries would also start producing a large carbon footprint is correct in the short run but in the long run the third world people would just drag the first world countries down and the carbon foot print would go down too.<br>
1. It is not the responsibility of whites to solve the problems of nonwhites.<br>
2. When nonwhites come here, in the long run it damages the white race. <br>

<p>Low birthrates suit economies that have outsourced many jobs (mostly to the Third World).  That&rsquo;s why we have so many unemployed.  As I&rsquo;ve said elsewhere on Amren regarding the &#8220;laziness&#8221; of locals and the &#8220;need&#8221; for migrant workers, our unemployed can fill our alleged labour shortages since by definition they are a labour surplus.</p>

		<p>There are plenty of whites in the world. In fact there are about 1.2 billion whites compared with about 1.4 East Asians. </p>
<p>So whites, as a race, are in the same ballpark as East Asians when it comes to absolute numbers.</p>
<p>There are far fewer Africans than whites (or Asians). And on average Africans, and other non-whites, have a far smaller carbon footprint than the average white.</p>
<p>So the author of the article, does in certain respects, have a point (regardless of the fact that he writes for the crackpot Falun Gong movement).</p>
<p>Furthermore he has a point when he talks of immigration.</p>
<p>Whites are in control of vast swathes of historically non-white lands. Much of the Russian Far East, for instance, was part of China up until very recently. Of course North America was historically non-white.</p>
<p>The greatest demographic onslaught in history by one group of people perpetrated against others, is by whites against non-whites. The impact of non-white immigration into white majority countries is miniscule compared to the impact that white immigration had on non-whites up to only a century ago.</p>
<p>So whites, regardless of whether non-white immigration is good for whites or not, on a moral ledger sheet have little cause for complaint.</p>
<p>The way of course for whites to ensure that truly historically white lands are maintained as white is for all white transplants to return to Europe. </p>
<p>For example there are almost as many Italian derived people outside of Italy as inside. Same goes for the Irish, and the Germans. Many of these people with just one grandparent born in their ancestral lands can claim an EU passport. If all these people returned to Europe, they would help maintain the white population of Europe.</p>

<p>Global warming (climate change) has recently been exposed as a total and complete fraud, but - in the typical tradition of these anti-White, Marxist-leftists who are behind the campaign to genocide people of European descent (who don&rsquo;t make good slaves and who are the #1 obstacle to a global, totalitarian Communist Police State and One World Government) - here is another article that ignores the exposure of the hoax and which continues to shovel the same kind of manure, as if the hoax was still fooling people.  </p>
<p>Hence, I agree with the recent comments of the Lord Monckton fellow who during an interview on Alex Jones&rsquo; radio show, advised that these global warming hoaxsters and lie peddlers be arrested, tried, and convicted and then sent to federal prison - and made to do hard labor busting big rocks with little hammers for the rest of their miserable lives.</p>

		<p>The worst thing that we can do to the environment is to bring a Third World person to the First World.  Third World farmers have a negligible environmental footprint.  But, once in the USA, they begin to consume like First World people.  In fact, when recent immigrants (people of color) have lower consumption than European Americans, we call it racism!  </p>
<p>Today, a typical Third World farmer uses less than a barrel of oil/yr, whereas each American uses on average over 50 barrels of oil/yr (based on total USA oil consumption per capita).  If, during the next 50 yrs, America imports 100 million Third Worlders, and those &#8220;new Citizens&#8221; began to consume like Americans, then that adds 5,000,000,000 ADDITIONAL barrels of oil that the USA will need to import EACH AND EVERY YEAR.  Because these immigrants will breed, the amount of oil needed doubles or triples EVERY generation, requiring an impossible increase in oil imports (and ever increasing pollution)!  </p>

		<p>Dear AmRen Readers,  I am a scientist, and I assure you that Climate Change is in fact real.  The problem is that yearly temperatures will fluctuate from high to low (we are currently in a temporary, 4-10 yr dip), but the long-term trend is definitely up. </p>
<p>The other point that is not understood by the public is that Climate Change will not necessarily manifest as higher local temperatures.  This is because 70% of the Earth&rsquo;s surface is ocean. Just a 1 degree increase in Earth&rsquo;s temperature means billions of tons more water evaporation from the ocean&rsquo;s surface.  this atmospheric moisture will have to fall somewhere.  Hence, &#8220;Global Warming&#8221; will manifest itself primarily as increased clouds and rain.  This will alter agricultural production. For example, in the Midwestern USA this year, record levels of rainfall has prevented corn and soybean harvests, and dramatically increased processing costs, due to the need to dry the wet grain.  Look also for more grain rot and insect infestation.  </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example of how population numbers influence economy and standard of living:  Right now, China is undergoing the most extensive and greatest economic turn-around in World history.  50 years ago, China was mired in poverty.  Today, the Chinese economy is skyrocketing.  1.3 billion people moved from abject poverty to lower-middle class in just 25 years, and, based on current trends, soon will become primarily middle-class. </p>
<p>How did this miracle happen?  In part by trading capitalism for communism.  But primarily by lowering their population (having a 1 child/family policy, while not allowing immigration.  In this way, all the wealth of 2 parents, 4 grand parents, and 8 great grandparents is passed to one child.  Wealth is concentrated, instead of being divided among many children.

<p>Ah, the typical multiculturalist canard: blame whitey for everything!</p>
<p>No one living today participated in invading Third World countries and subjecting their population. Thus, it&rsquo;s idiotic to hold grudges for things that happened a long time ago.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to hold whites to this standard, you need to be fair and hold other ethnic groups to the same standard. For example, why aren&rsquo;t you making a fuss about the Arab-Berbers who enslaved 1.25 million Europeans over the course of 300 years?</p>
<p>Assuming you&rsquo;re of Chinese descent, why aren&rsquo;t you making grievances on behalf of the Chinese towards Japan? The atrocities the Japanese committed against the Chinese during the 1930s and 1940s dwarf the so-called atrocities committed by whites against non-whites.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t expect you to be fair, though, because your anti-white bigotry is quite obvious.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re either a skilled troll or totally delusional.</p>
<p>Lastly, I&rsquo;d like to suggest that since you&rsquo;re so unhappy with whites that you relocate to a place where our numbers are negligible, perhaps back to your country of origin.</p>

		<p>It is all a matter of proportion.  What needs to be controlled is runaway third world populations.  I believe that most people in devoloped nations hold back from large families because they can&rsquo;t see how they could afford to raise a large family and that such a families prospects in terms of national security and economic security appear unstanble in both the short and long term.  Add to that, the growing awareness of the problems that an already overpopulated world is causing and you have very little incentive to birth very many babies.  This is why the bulk of resources spent of third world development ought to be spent on controlling populations rather than creating the next slaves for the world&rsquo;s corporations to exploit.  </p>
<p>Some critics say that Europeans are too materialistic and selfish and this may be true to an extent, but my experience in Europe is not this, rather, it is that they want to enjoy life.  This is understandable when one reviews the European experience over the past 200 years (at the least).</p>
<p>The governments must do as nations such as Slovenia does and reward both parents for having children that are racial and ethnic nationals while contributing to an international effort to reduce births in developing nations.</p>
<p>The problem is that governments always do too little too late and no one sees that trend changing, while those same governments pretend that increasing foreign and culturally incompatable masses is a good thing for the future of developed nations.</p>

		<p>If it is bad for white people to have children because people in the West use up more resources, then surely it is madness to allow mass immigration to the West where the greater childbearing of those from the Third World will require much more resources than they would if they had stayed at home. The writer fails to mention this basic fact. Liberals moan about scarce resources and damage to the environment but at the same time they encourage mass immigration. The liberal left inhabit a world where the truth is just what they want it to be and it bears no resemblance whatsoever to reality.</p>

<p>First, do you agree, that overpopulation and the environmental stressors it causes, cannot be solved be decreasing white birthrates in Western countries, while encouraging immigration from the Third World into those same Western countries? If not, please explain to me how these Third World &ldquo;immigrants&rdquo; will not eventually exacerbate the environmental stressors in question, once they become &ldquo;responsible citizens&rdquo; of the Western World. Be careful here Anonymous #41, this question is a minefield and nobody here will tolerate any prevarications regarding the obvious truths that explode upon it, once you have trekked across it.</p>
<p>Secondly, do you agree that multiculturalism is the &ldquo;way to go&rdquo; in solving all the world&rsquo;s problems, including &ldquo;global warming?&rdquo; If so, please explain how this works and why white people, once eliminated through a multicultural genocide, will have fulfilled their &ldquo;duty&rdquo; to both the planet and its remaining population. Issues revolving around the natural fluctuations in climate, or the unnatural political trends in the &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; community are to be considered here, but not exhaustively. The main issue revolves around how multiculturalism will stop &ldquo;global warming&rdquo; and &ldquo;racism&rdquo; logically. Also, how &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and &ldquo;global warming,&rdquo; are interconnected, and thus logically require multiculturalism as a corrective measure.</p>

<p>It is a total waste of time!</p>
<p>His arguments are always the same, he never really has deviated from his general line of thought in the year or so that he has been posting here, which is that whites are wicked land grabbers and rapists, and only once every white woman on the planet is a concubine of a Chinese Communist, will the situation be corrected. He fails to answer questions as to why he lives in a former British colony (Hong Kong, if he even really does) and not Red China proper; or why he is married to a white woman and not a &ldquo;superior&rdquo; Chinese woman, when asked.  Indeed, I would be surprised if this paragraph below isn&rsquo;t saved on his electronic abacus (what we call a computer) and simply altered from time to time: </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s all quite simple, really.  White people have to limit the size of their families because they have to pay the bill for their families for the families of the blacks and browns of the world.  It&rsquo;s really a sort of reverse Darwinism.  Society&rsquo;s achievers (whites) should have more children because they can afford more childen.  Society&rsquo;s non-achievers (blacks and browns) should have less children because they can&rsquo;t afford them.  But instead, the non-achievers have produce more children than the achievers because they get to do it on the achievers&rsquo; dime.  Hence, white decline.</p>

<p>This type of comment always makes me laugh. On the one hand people here identify with their <i>race</i>, and then on the other when it does not suit them, the change the focus of discussion to the <i>individual</i> level.</p>
<p>If you confine your level of analysis to the <i>racial</i> level, then it is completely appropriate to discuss an entire race, its glories and its disgraces, in the way one would discuss the record of a single individual. And that is the level of analysis that most people engage in here, myself included. An analogy could be when historians talk of &#8216;Germany&rsquo; invading Poland and &#8216;Germany&rsquo; being the aggressor. The nation &#8216;Germany&rsquo;is discussed of in terms that one would use to discuss an individual - the historian of course is not required at every turn to qualify his comment with, &#8220;but we are not speaking of every German man, woman, and child, being guilty of aggression etc.&#8221; If indeed required to do so, that would quickly become a nuisance.</p>
<p>It is in fact quite a reasonable riposte to an anti-immigrant white man, to point out that his own parents, or grandparents were themselves immigrants, who benefitted from the dispossession of native peoples, and that this same white man continues to enjoy these benefits and advantages today - at the expense of the descendants of the originally dispossessed (if indeed they do exist, those non-existent ones could have existed had their hypothetical parents and grandparents had not been slaughtered).</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The atrocities the Japanese committed against the Chinese during the 1930s and 1940s dwarf the so-called atrocities committed by whites against non-whites&#8221;</i></p>
<p>You are obviously unfamiliar with the Opium War, the genocide of the Hereros, and King Leopold&rsquo;s little hobby farm in the Congo.</p>
<p><br>
<i>&#8220;Assuming you&rsquo;re of Chinese descent, why aren&rsquo;t you making grievances on behalf of the Chinese towards Japan?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Certainly Japan should compensate China for her past imperialist depredations - and this is still a hot button topic in China (although it is my understanding in the early 70s, Premier Zhou Enlai promised that China would not pursue reparations).</p>
<p>But I would remind you of one important fact - the Japanese do not live in China anymore. Ninety nine percent of Japanese derived people live in Japan. They have returned home. Can the same be said of most English derived, or Italian derived, or Spanish derived, or German derived, or Irish derived people in the world?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Dear AmRen Readers, I am a scientist, and I assure you that Climate Change is in fact real. The problem is that yearly temperatures will fluctuate from high to low (we are currently in a temporary, 4-10 yr dip), but the long-term trend is definitely up&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Here we go again my fellow AR posters, John Liu at his best and proving my above point (#51):</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are obviously unfamiliar with the Opium War&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was written in response to a comment that was made by Anonymous (#43) regarding Japanese atrocities in China both before (1920s and early 1930s) and during World War II (mid-1930s through 1945) in comparison to European colonialism before that period. Since when did any single day reap 250,000 Chinese deaths during the Opium Wars or the entire colonial period by Europeans, as did the Rape of Nanking by the Japanese? Not to mention, the unmitigated cruelty of the rapes and murders during that 24 hour gore orgy by the Japanese? There isn&rsquo;t one recorded and there never will be!</p>
<p>This is what I mean by Comrade Liu&rsquo;s selective &ldquo;historic&rdquo; memory,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

		<p>Dear John Liu,</p>
<p>You are an intelligent and knowledgable man, and I welcome your comments at this site.  I do wish to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p>Do you think that Hong Kong would benefit by increasing its diversity   &mdash;   by importing 1 million each of Africans, Japanese, Indians, and Muslims?  It seems like the added diversity would invigorate Hong Kong, and the addition of new eager workers would add to the economy.  </p>
<p>Also, do you approve or disapprove of China&rsquo;s One-child policy.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

		<p>Dear John Post # 49,</p>
<p>&#8220;do you agree, that overpopulation and the environmental stressors it causes, cannot be solved be decreasing white birthrates&#8221;  John, I agree with you completely.</p>
<p>&#8220;do you agree that multiculturalism is the &ldquo;way to go&rdquo;   Absolutely not.  Multiculturalism will destroy the West.</p>
<p>However, it is still true that human-caused CO2 emissions are raising Earth&rsquo;s temperatures.  I assure you that this is a fact, notwithstanding the shriking on talk radio.  Most importantly is that the surest way to increase global warming is to transfer millions of low-carbon footprint Third Worlders into the First world, where they will quickly assume a high-carbon footprint.  </p>

		<p>Dear # 44,</p>
<p>I assure you that Global Warming is real.  That doesn&rsquo;t mean that the same people who brought you outsourcing, the Global Economy, international banking, and massive Third World immigration into Western countries only, will not also try to make money off of it (carbon swaps, etc.).  </p>
<p>As one of Obama&rsquo;s men recently said, &#8220;a good crises should not be wasted.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a scientists, my recommendation for global warming is to do nothing.  Yes, sea levels will rise, and climate will change, but, so what.  There will be some bad and some good.  For example, Canada and Russia will both have longer growing seasons.</p>

          I&rsquo;m starting to find you continual whining rather tiresome - same old points again and again, same old &#8216;chip on the shoulder&rsquo; same outright aggression and hatred against Whites (if John Liu&rsquo;s strand of thinking is common amongst Chinese then we are in very serious danger indeed).<br>
 As to those Opium Wars you keep banging on about consider this - the Chinese vastly outnumbered the English who had to take themselves and all of their equipment thousands of miles away in wooden ships in a long and perilous sea journey.<br>
 - Why didn&rsquo;t your ancestors smash them utterly!!!! - that&rsquo;s the real question - Why did your ancestors fail you and let you down when they had every advantage, Why?.<br>
 I know its hard for you to heap opprobrium on your ancestors but in not fighting back hard enough they are at least to blame for your humiliation (that obviously still rankles you)than the English invaders were.</p>

<p>The founding fathers of the United States intended it to be a country for whites, and whites only. The Preamble of the Constitution states:</p>
<p>&ldquo; We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. &#8220;</p>
<p>Your command of English is good enough to know the meaning of the word posterity. Posterity is <br>
1. future or succeeding generations<br>
2. all of one&rsquo;s descendants</p>
<p>There it is, literally written in black and white.</p>

<p>By that standard, virtually no one on earth ought to have any say in his country&rsquo;s immigration policies, since virtually everyone on earth is descended from someone who lived somewhere else. Yet this sort of non-logic is never applied to any but white populations. Connor Cruise O&rsquo;Brien once remarked that he&rsquo;d never met an Ashanti ashamed of the empire-building activities of his ancestors. I defy you to name the non-white populace that can be motivated to  act or to feel guilty about themselves and their culture because of anything in their past.  The descendants of the Aztecs and Mayans, for instance, are never said to be obliged to aliens merely on the basis of something their ancestors did, nor is any Asian nation held bound by some ancient atrocity committed against &#8220;indigenous&#8221; people; in fact, as pointed out above, Asians are perfectly happy to emigrate to white nations founded upon the horrors you condemn. In other words, clearing out the natives is awful and dirty work, but the Chinese are more than happy to take advantage of someone else&rsquo;s heavy lifting, a phenomenon we see more concretely in that nation&rsquo;s ongoing campaign of industrial espionage and intellectual property theft. <br>

<p>Your ancestral relative, Genghis Khan probably holds the world&rsquo;s record for invading foreign people and racial genocide.  Why don&rsquo;t you discuss that?</p>
<p>Chairman Mao also was exceptional in murder, although primarily against his own people.  </p>
<p>Today, the helpless peaceful people of Tibet suffer cultural genocide and displacement by the Chinese.  Can you please expand on that subject?   </p>

<p>The weakness of China, her pathetic resistance against imperialism, has caused massive soul searching, self-criticism in China for over one hundred years. Chinese are the first to admit we fell behind, we were backward (and still are) compared to the West. The anguished question what is wrong with China was asked repeatedly - likewise what could save China? In the end it seems that what is saving China, and will resurrect China as a great power, is Communism - a foreign ideological import.</p>
<p>So yes, my ancestors deserve all the opprobrium (from us Chinese) it is possible to dump on them for their ineptitude in defending the country.</p>
<p><br>
Now I have said that I will point out a logical fallacy on your own part by way of a couple of an analogy.</p>
<p>If your wife went out leaving the windows and doors unlocked (assuming you live in a moderately unsafe neighbourhood), and as a consequence your house is burgled, do you forgive the burgler on account of the carelessness of your wife? </p>
<p>What would you think if the police on catching the burglar, then turn round and say, on account of the carelessness of your wife, you have no right to demand that the burglar be punished?</p>
<p>That would be absurd. Of course on one level your wife is fully at fault. She was negligent. If she was an employee who exhibited a similar level of negligence she would be sacked. </p>
<p>On the criminal level however, the burglar is obviously culpable, and should be administered condign punishment - completely regardless of the fact that had your wife been diligent and locking the doors and windows, the burglary would likely not have occurred.</p>
<p>Both your wife, and the burglar, are in their own ways fully responsible for the burglary. But only the burglar is <i>criminally</i> culpable.</p>
<p>Now you get my drift in the context of your original flawed statement?</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Do you think that Hong Kong would benefit by increasing its diversity  &mdash;  by importing 1 million each of Africans, Japanese, Indians, and Muslims?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>For practical reasons, bringing in one million of the aforementioned into Hong Kong (population 7 million) would create an impossible situation. The flow of mainland Chinese into the territory is strictly controlled. But to answer the intent of your question, I do not think there is anything wrong in ancient lands like China, Japan, Italy, Sweden, Norway, or Greece wishing to maintain their respective identities. In order to do so, of course you need to retain a population which is mainly descended from the original founders of their respective national cultures.</p>
<p>But to do this, one not need to feel discomfort for fear that this is a racist policy. After all suddenly replacing 60 million Italians in Italy with 60 million racially similar Englishmen would utterly change the culture and character of Italy. Similarly the Japanese would not want to be replaced by Koreans, nor the Thais replaced by Chinese.</p>
<p>Maintaining the indigenous populations of ancient nations should be no more controversial than an individual inheriting wealth from ones parents. And in fact, to a certain extent it already is not. Afterall many European (and Asian) countries practice jus sanguinis, not jus soli, and many recognize diaspora citizens of other countries, as fellow ethnics still entitled to citizenship in their original source lands. No one says this is racial discrimination - it is simply a matter of inheritance writ large.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Also, do you approve or disapprove of China&rsquo;s One-child policy.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>At the moment probably approve - although it does have a shelf life - and that could be approaching in the not too distant future. China had only a population of 450 million in 1949. Allowing the population to balloon out to 1.3 billion was a big big mistake. The one-child policy was needed to prevent even further potentially catastrophic growth. But it has had its side effects - a skewed boy-girl ratio, and a rapid greying of the population, the effect of these is starting to be seen now.</p>
