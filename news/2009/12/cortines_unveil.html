			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Howard Blume, Los Angeles Times, December 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>L.A.&rsquo;s top school official on Thursday unveiled his plan to shut down Fremont High and start over from scratch  &mdash;  a move denounced by the teachers union but applauded by city leaders and the nation&rsquo;s secretary of education.</p>
<p>After quietly alerting the Fremont staff Wednesday afternoon, Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Ramon C. Cortines spoke separately with students, parents, city leaders and U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan, who was in town to promote such school turnarounds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The plan for Fremont, located in Florence south of downtown, includes dismissing the entire staff as of June 30. Those interested in returning would be interviewed before then by hiring committees that will probably include parents, instructional specialists, skilled teachers and Principal Rafael L. Balderas, in his first year at Fremont. Cortines himself would help develop an &#8220;elect to work&#8221; agreement for all hires. Under the union contract, Fremont&rsquo;s displaced teachers have the right to a district job elsewhere.</p>
<p>Such reconstitutions are new to the nation&rsquo;s second-largest school system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boston College education professor Dennis Shirley called the reconstitutions harmfully &#8220;disruptive,&#8221; and said &#8220;policymakers seem to think there&rsquo;s this limitless pool of people who want to work in the most impoverished and struggling communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At Fremont, distressed students refused to go to class during an afternoon sit-in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you say Fremont High is a bad school?&#8221; senior Cristal Guizar asked during Cortines&rsquo; visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;The data shows this school is not successful academically,&#8221; Cortines responded.</p>
<p>Only 1.5% of students are proficient in math; 13.9% are proficient in English.</p>
<p>Talking to parents, Cortines also laid out plans for accelerating what students learn before getting to Fremont. He talked of shared accountability that would include imposing a dress code.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want the pants hanging down around the ass of the young men on this campus and I don&rsquo;t want the midriff showing,&#8221; he said as some parents nodded their approval.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>If the students want to know why Fremont is a &#8220;bad school,&#8221; they should look in the mirror.  If &#8220;skilled teachers&#8221; are to help decide who gets to teach in the new school, what does this say about the quality of the existing or potential new teachers?  </p>
<p>And no matter what clothes you put them in, they can&rsquo;t learn if they don&rsquo;t have the IQ to absorb knowledge.  Pulling up your pants doesn&rsquo;t raise your IQ.</p>

		<p>A similar action actually succeeded a decade or so ago at Bel Air HS in El Paso, Texas, the blackest high school in town. <i>Everyone</i> employed there, all the way down to the janitors, was sacked and had to show good cause why they should get their jobs back. The tail-kicking must have worked, because test scores went way up in just a few years.</p>

		<p>Strider said, &#8220;The tail-kicking must have worked, because test scores went way up in just a few years.&#8221;   I wouldn&rsquo;t trust any results from the public school systems, especially the troubled systems.   The Atlanta metro area has had a series of school scandals involving teachers and school administrators cheating on standardized tests by changing students answers.  They are often caught because they alter large numbers of test and end up with easily discovered unnatural patterns of correct answers. </p>

		<p>Reasons for failure?</p>
<p>The facilities are out of date. The textbooks are out of date. Bloated administration. NO hot breakfasts. NO hot lunches. NO hot breakfasts and NO hot lunches. NO toilet paper in the wash rooms. NO hand towels in the washrooms. NO soap in the washrooms. Teachers union is to blame. Don&rsquo;t care teachers are to blame. Poorly written lesson plans. Overcrowding. NO dress code. Not enough stress on basics. Etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>How about the kids are lazy, dumb and stupid and don&rsquo;t even try.</p>
<p>And how about those stats. How would you like to be the one or two white kids in the schoo&rsquo;? Well, you might end up valedictorian.</p>

<p>Testing Services such as ETS also look for large numbers of erasures on the answer sheets.  Not to worry, educators have plenty of ways to get around something as simple as &#8216;too many erasures&rsquo;</p>
<p>According to NCLB:  &#8220;The goal of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) is to have 100 percent of America&rsquo;s public school students &#8216;proficient&rsquo; by the year 2014.&#8221;</p>
<p>As of now, only 30% of students score &#8216;proficient&rsquo; on NAEP tests (2008) six years after the start of NCLB. By 2014, NCLB expects all children to score at the 70th percentile.   </p>
<p>Fremont &#8216;boasts&rsquo; scores of proficiency  of 1.5% of students in math and 13.9% in English, not uncommon numbers in the Land of Babble (Los Angeles) with its large, low IQ&rsquo;d, disinterested, disconnected White replacement population.  The educational-industrial complex has approximately four more years to meet the government&rsquo;s deadline  &mdash;  and then what?</p>
<p>I give these tests and have studied them thoroughly (the ACTUAL test).  The practice books and study guides put out by the likes of Kaplan and many other textbook companies looking to make money are profoundly more difficult than what is on the actual test.  The public is allowed to view the practice books and study guides (what the students are to be tested on and/or expected to regurgitate) all they want  &mdash;  not the ACTUAL tests as they are under so-called high security (I have to sign several affidavits when I give these test stating that I will not make copies, give out answers to the tests, will abide by testing guidelines, will lock up tests when not in use).</p>
<p>The public would be shocked at how ridiculously easy the actual tests are  &mdash;  and the  new replacement non-White children (excluding Asians), the ones the government tells us are interchangeable with our White children  &mdash;  cannot score above BB or FBB (Below Basic/Far Below Basic).  </p>
<p>And they never will.</p>

		<p>In 1987 I graduated from a majority white semi-rural highschool. Hispanics were the next largest group with blacks bringing up the rear. There didn&rsquo;t seem to be really any racial related issues or drop out problems then.  I suppose the overiding white  enviroment kept everything on the up and there were no poisonous hispanic or black ghetto cultures to screw things up either </p>
<p>Twenty-two years later the student population has become  majority hispanic and the numbers of blacks has increased also The school is rife with that ghetto garbage &#8220;culture&#8221; and has become a madhouse more or less.<br>
Ahh and guess what, now they have a drop out problem. Go figure. Ha ha ha. </p>
<p>A few years ago this district finally opened a second highschool close to my neighborhood. It opened pretty much as an instant majority black ghetto school due the all lovely &#8220;progress&#8221; of demographic change in the area.  It didn&rsquo;t take long for the &#8220;scholars&#8221; to do what they do best and start destroying a brand new school. Damn, what a waste. </p>
<p>They infest the local fastfood places too. In the 80s if you went into an establishment chances were you would be greeted by a cute blonde with nice hair, tight jeans and pleasant attitude. Now if you dare enter into such a place there&rsquo;s a rather large glowering black behind the counter with the dispostion to match.</p>
<p>Man, my neighborhood sucks now.<br>

		<p>Why blame the teachers? Blame instead the administrators who are responsible for maintaining teaching standards.</p>
<p>Firing them all without any basis (e.g. evaluations, disciplinary warnings) is constructive dismissal. Expect lawsuits up the wazoo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the union contract, Fremont&rsquo;s displaced teachers have the right to a district job elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a win-lose proposition. The teachers can have the district find them a job at a school that&rsquo;s more pleasant to teach at; the school has to find new teachers in a state where, last I heard, they&rsquo;ve been lowering hiring standards due to the shortage of qualified teachers.</p>
<p>This is just an (potentially expensive) grab for publicity.</p>

		<p>I work in a major urban school district.  Do you know how much grade inflation goes on in minority-majority schools?  Do you know how much the supervisors manipulate the data and yes, change student scores? I have seen a lot of it in only three years - enough to disgust me.  Never, ever, trust the tide of rising scores in minority schools, especially after a school shake-up, because the new hires get the message, and the younger the teachers are, the more likely they feel no compunction about cheating to protect their jobs.  Morals were thrown out of our society some 20 years ago.</p>

		<p>Yes, the public would be SHOCKED if the reality of students&rsquo; academic level were made clear.  Policy here in the Los Angeles Unified School District is to &#8216;socially promote&rsquo; students (to the next grade level) regardless of grades.  Students so learn that everyone in their class goes to the next grade level regardless of how dismally they perform academically.  By the time LAUSD students reach 9th grade, a majority have been failing steadily in Math, English, Science for their entire middle school career.  Until grade level corresponds to academic achievement instead of age, high schools will not be able to put a 5-year patch on the academic skills that students do not bother to cultivate.  Why study and pass classes when you get promoted to the next grade every year anyway?  Negative consequences for poor academic performance and behavior simply do not exist here and it is impossible to increase achievement in an intellectual and moral vacume. </p>

<p>Skip:</p>
<p>You should care.  Anyone who is a White American NATIVE BORN citizen should care.</p>
<p>Read Anon #8&rsquo;s post  &mdash;  the demographics in the entire country are rapidly changing not just in my home, The Land of Babble, but everywhere  &mdash;  and changing extremely rapidly.</p>
<p>I read daily on this board of places as far-flung (from California) as Maine, Montana and Louisiana that are experiencing the effects of large hoards of unskilled, illiterate, fecund hispanic immigrants settling into White rural, urban, suburban, and ex-urban areas, flooding the schools and social services.  It won&rsquo;t stop there, though because they&rsquo;re not leaving  &mdash;  they will take over your town through overbreeding and it will eventually resemble something you won&rsquo;t recognize (and where you won&rsquo;t be safe).  </p>
<p>Soon their activists will start demanding endless services and their numbers will allow them to elect those of their own race and mind-set  &mdash;  mostly anti-White socialists who believe the American government and White Americans owe them everything.  Their children will be placed ahead of your children for college placements, scholarships, jobs and careers due to anti-White government-enforced AA policies. </p>
<p>You will have no voice, no activists that will make demands for you, no organizations that you can call upon to defend your Civil Rights  &mdash;  in fact you will be called a White, hateful Nazi for even pointing this out.  You may be also told to &#8216;go back to Europe&rsquo; or &rsquo; You White people stole this land from us  &mdash;  get off!&rsquo;</p>
<p>We Whites in California have experienced all of this and more  &mdash;  including large hoards of hispanics marching in OUR streets, waving the flags of their country, throwing frozen bottles at the police, screaming obscenities at Whites, demanding that they be made legal immediately, breaking American laws  &mdash;  and then later sue the police for brutality and win.</p>
<p>Do you think the hispanics will stop after they&rsquo;ve &#8216;conquered&rsquo; California?</p>
<p>This is coming your way, no matter where you live in this country.  Pay attention to what is happening in California  &mdash;  this will be your fate too.</p>

		<p>This short article speaks volumes about latinos and education. Test results this bad is indicative of latino culture in general, where anti-intellectualism is the norm, and doing well in school is seen as something to be mocked and belittled. </p>
<p>Look at it this way: in a typical white family (or asian family), enough education happens in the home that many white kids don&rsquo;t even need to go to elementary school. They go for the socialization. It&rsquo;s very common for whites and asians to learn to read and do basic math in the home, before first grade!</p>
<p>And yet for other groups, like this latino population, white taxpayers have to pay through the nose in a futile attempt to educate latino kids who are raised in a home environment hostile to education and who take that attitude with them to school. </p>

		<p>Teachers may not be completely innocent, but they are not the main problem.  They just make a really good scape goat.  Public schools in urban settings don&rsquo;t have a prayer.  If learning is going to take place, the students need to hold up their part of the bargain too.  Before you jump on teachers or their union we need to ask if the students there want to learn.  We know what the answer is here.  You could have Albert Einstein teaching in some of these war zones and learning is NOT going to take place.  Everything about their culture is anti-learning.  If one student tries to achieve, he/she is likely to be ridiculed, humiliated, beaten, etc&hellip; by the majority who don&rsquo;t want to.  We could make a list three pages long of the reasons why these students cannot, will not, and refuse to learn.  Having a better qualified teacher will change that?  Dream on.  A teacher who COULD focus more time on better methods, lesson plans, or strategies wastes too much time trying not to get shanked.</p>
<p>BTW, No child left behind, what a joke.  I teach in a rural area of one of our more intelligent states and its not very diverse (Thank God).  If you read anything into state scores or averages, think of it like this.  Most rural schools where I&rsquo;m at can crush the NCLB standards. Good teachers, good students willing to achieve, learning takes place.  ONE city school, ONE city school with a large enrollment can effectively wipe out the achievements of 15 rural publics.  One large being roughly equal to 15 smalls in total enrollment.  The sub-par results of the urban school tanks the state averages.  God only knows how many rural schools it would take to repair the damage done by one  ONE large urban ghetto war zone.  Want to guess what the make-up of these individual schools consists of?  </p>

		<p>Public schools in general have been failing for at least the last 30 or 40 years. Even when I graduated from high school nearly 20 years ago you had to perform at least somewhat to get a diploma. High schools are not much more than holding pens for kids who merely have not reached the government sanctioned age of 18 to be considered adults. There used to be classes to teach kids useful skills so that they could enter the job market immediatly on graduation but with the constant pushing of college and other higher education those classes have been moved to the community college level. Students now have to pay tuition to attend these where previously they were able to enroll for free. In the town where I grew up there was a vocational school that offered kids in grades 11 and 12 the chance to graduate with a certificate in areas like cosmetology, dental hygenist, automotive and similar classes. Now they have been absorbed into the community college system (kids can still enroll in grade 12) and most of the classes are part of a two year associate&rsquo;s degree. The hardest hit of all students are kids who are working class or poor Whites who would have had the opportunity for these classes now almost always have the door slam shut on them. Sure if they are bright and academically sucessful they can try to get a scholarship (what remains after all of the minority only scholarships are given out) but if they are average intellegence and would have been vocational or technical material there is not much out there for them. </p>

<p>Check the per pupil per year spending at the rural schools you describe vs the city/urban/black schools.  You will find the rural schools not only get less, but way less.  In Missouri, the disparity can be as much as four times.  States and their governments, plus the Federal Dept of Education, is biased toward minorities, and put more money in their schools.  You told us how well it works.</p>

<p>Right. When Arne Duncan was head of the Chicago Public schoo&rsquo; system [the man had no educational background for the position at all] he kept speaking over and over about the tremendous improvement in test scores. 50 % gain over last year, 33 % gain over the year before that, etc.</p>
<p>Well, the test scores were manipulated year after year, definitions changed, etc. And the scores had NO WHERE to go but up and that was that. Anywhere from zero is a step upward, but that says nothing.</p>

		<p>The politics behind this sudden concern of the Los Angeles School district for &#8220;educational standards&#8221; is quite simply. No need at all to get sidetracked. Los Angeles is the illegal alien capital of the United States. Illegal immigration in the form of the anchor babies going to L.A. schools, SUCKS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS of the county treasury away. Mr. Cortines knows this is a disaster, the elite that actually are behind people like the Mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa, especially know this is a disaster. To put the cherry on the cake, Villaraigosa is on another one of his &#8220;trips&#8221;, touring Europe, eating in high class places, meeting with the European royalty and in general having a fun time  &mdash;  about one-hundred eighty thousand dollars of taxpayer paid fun,to be exact.</p>
<p>In the meantime, to add more background to this &#8220;typical California city story&#8221;, the State of California has issued bonds, that no one in the U.S. is stupid enough to buy,(California politicians can&rsquo;t fool American investors any longer,it seems) so they are looking to foreign investers. This is another reason why I constantly accuse the leaders of this nation  &mdash;  of being useless to the citizens at best, and/or outright traitors at worst.</p>

		<p>re:Bon re: illegals marching-&#8220;You may be also told to &lsquo;go back to Europe&rsquo; or &rsquo; You White people stole this land from us &mdash; get off!&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>What these stupid people don&rsquo;t realize is that it&rsquo;s not about land, it&rsquo;s  the people who MAKE a place. If all Whites went back to Europe as they say they want, then they would end up with the same thing that they fled. They left Mexico because they couldn&rsquo;t create a functioning society, what makes them think that a change of venue will change that. Idiots. <br>
