<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-general/20091210/US.Black.Caucus.Obama/">Black Lawmakers Grow Impatient With White House</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Evans, Comcast, December 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black lawmakers who have held their tongues during most of President Barack Obama&rsquo;s first year in office are stepping up their demands that the nation&rsquo;s first black president do more for minority communities hit hardest by the recession.</p>
<p>While still careful about criticizing Obama publicly, they appear to be losing their patience after a year of watching him dedicate trillions of dollars to prop up banks and corporations and fight wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, while double-digit unemployment among blacks crept even higher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama has tried desperately to stay away from race, and all of us understand what he&rsquo;s doing,&#8221; said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo. &#8220;But when you have such a disproportionate number of African-Americans unemployed, it would be irresponsible not to direct attention and resources to the people who are receiving the greatest level of pain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dating back to Obama&rsquo;s campaign, many black leaders have pressed him to take more of a stand on the challenges facing minorities. Most voiced criticisms privately for fear of jeopardizing his candidacy or undercutting his popularity after his election. They also have tread lightly so as not to be at odds with their own majority-black constituencies, who strongly support Obama.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And earlier this week, the all-Democratic caucus responded to Obama&rsquo;s proposal for a new jobs package by saying it would insist on initiatives targeted to minorities. Pointing to outsized percentages of African-Americans losing their jobs and homes, caucus Chairwoman Barbara Lee, D-Calif., said Obama must live up to his campaign talk that racial disparities cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The unemployment rate among African-Americans is nearly 16 percent, almost double the 9 percent rate for whites. Roughly one in four blacks lives in poverty, compared with about 11 percent of whites.</p>
<p>Obama was a black caucus member in the Senate before winning the White House last year, but he has never had a close relationship with the group. In recent interviews, he has addressed their criticisms by saying he must represent the entire country, not any one population, and the best way to help low-income communities is to improve the overall economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s a mistake to start thinking in terms of particular ethnic segments of the United States rather than to think that we are all in this together and we are all going to get out of this together,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Many blacks in Congress take exception to that view, arguing that decades of neglect and discrimination warrant particular attention to minority concerns. {snip}</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s all bluff and wind on the part of black legislators.  Actions speak louder than in words, and in 2012, they&rsquo;ll all vote Obama.  So why are the supposedly upset with him?</p>
<p>Answer   &mdash;   I think it&rsquo;s a game.  Obama wants to (1) Triangulate, and (2) Not make his left wing base mad.  So the obvious answer is to have black members of Congress (and a few white Democrats in safe districts) pretend to be upset with him.</p>

<p>PLEASE&hellip;&hellip;.PLEASE&hellip;&hellip;get off that silly mantra that everybody knows is a lie.</p>
<p>Blacks are not failing or falling behind because of anything other than their own lack of intelligence and abilities.  No program on earth is going to make them smart or improve their lack of abilities.  No amount of money will do that either.</p>
<p>The only real chance blacks have of keeping up with the Joneses is to work within a communist society where each is given according to his needs and from each is taken according to his ability.</p>
<p>But the only ones in existence now, of any size, are China, North Korea and Cuba.  China doesn&rsquo;t like blacks and considers them criminals and incompetents, and North Korea&rsquo;s economy has almost collapsed.   Only Cuba might be a possibility for relocation.  But, then again, wouldn&rsquo;t the island be a bit crowded with 36 million more black loafers?  </p>

		<p>Obama is smart enough (or he has good enough advisors) to know that enacting an explicitly black agenda, at least during his first term) would have the effect of waking up a lot of white people as to his explicitly pro-black, anti-white mentality. The desire to help all Americans equally doesn&rsquo;t jibe with the explicitly racial message of his autobiography.</p>

		<p>As an addendum to my above post, I wonder how long it is until something like this plays out for Comrade BO, with the black &ldquo;community&rdquo; and his other wild-eyed Marxist supporters? </p>

		<p>It would appear that black demands for preferential treatment are now a permanent feature of American society.  It&rsquo;s been, what, over forty years since LBJ launched his Great Society programs to bring blacks and other aggrieved minorities into an equal economic and social status with the rest of America.  They&rsquo;re now further in the hole than ever, with 80% of black children being born out of wedlock, black unemployment rates higher than ever, black criminality at all time highs, and their sense of grievance also approaching new highs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that this situation is hardly unique to the US.  Blacks are on the bottom of the social and economic ladder everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Clearly, we haven&rsquo;t properly addressed the ubiquitous &#8220;root causes.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The CBC and the Chairman are being slick.  The CBC cries &#8220;you ain&rsquo;t nuthin for your own people&#8221;.  BO responds with &#8220;but have to be President of all the people&#8221;!  This ensures enough white votes to win reelection.  When he wins a second term, with nothing to lose, he will hammer white America with a vengeance.<br>

		<p>I recall Jared Taylor predicting disaffection in the black community at the time of BHO&rsquo;s election with 90 plus percent of the black vote.  It is surprising that the grumbling is beginning among the devoted at less than one year of &lsquo;rule&rsquo; by a black man.  Some were lining up in Detroit recently for handouts from Barack&rsquo;s stash.<br>
The problems are centered in the ghettos of several large cities populated by residents of IQ in the 70 to 85 range (many of the smarter ones have already bailed).  Taylor anticipated that the problems in these communities are virtually intractable and Obama, like previous administrations, would make little if any headway in bettering their conditions.  Unfortunately for Obama, these black citizens expect the First Black President to turn the trash in their lives into treasures.  Very high expectations and nothing but rhetoric for solutions make for a volatile relationship!<br>

<p>They mean that Obama should just send them money to stop their whining. Won&rsquo;t work. Sending more money just makes them whine more.</p>
<p>What they need is for Obama to tell them that they are getting no more free ride and that they have to start studying in school, stop taking drugs, stop making babies out of marriage, stop expecting a job handed to them, stop demanding promotions for no work, stop demanding special privileges, and start obeying the law like civilized people. <br>

		<p>  One of the first steps President Obama could take that would help black unemployment would be a curtailment of immigration. Why won&rsquo;t the Black Caucus consider that? Why&hellip; because their part of the same elites ruining this country. </p>

		<p>I sometimes wonder if we should just refer to the black African race as the &#8220;special needs&#8221; race and simply make the appropriate allowances for them.</p>
<p>After a half-century of desperate, almost frantic, efforts to bring them into the mainstream culturally, socially, and economically, it&rsquo;s time to acknowledge what everybody, including the black Africans themselves, knows.  To wit, they are, as a group, intellectually handicapped, and to a significant degree. Are there exceptions to this generalization?  Absolutely, to the extent that there are positively brilliant and creative black Africans, they should be allowed to progress as far as their abilities will take them.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s time to acknowledge that there&rsquo;s simply no prospect of seeing them equally represented in all strata of society.  This hardly means that they can&rsquo;t be contributing members of that society.  Skilled tradesmen, line-workers, all manner of manual laborers, care-givers, etc. are all essential contributors to a modern nation, and all can make a good, often handsome, living wage for themselves and their families.  And as noted above, there should be no limits imposed on how far they may legitimately progress on their own individual merits.</p>
<p>But to continue the fantasy that they should and can be equally represented in all areas of human endeavor is specious, pointless, and, ultimately, socially destructive. </p>

		<p>If the black community want jobs, then demand that this administration stop the invasion. Blacks as well as whites must compete with illegal aliens who cut wages for everyone. Stop the invasion and jobs will be plentiful and the country will see a decline in crime as well as many other advantages to not having people here whose first act was to dishonor our laws. Yet the President and many in Congress want to overlook all this and hand them our most precious gift - citizenship. What a travesty!</p>

		<p>Obama is busy working with the UN to get rid of important liberties for average Americans while pushing preference for homosexuals, feminists, and non-whites (despite whites being a minority now in some parts of the country including California and Texas). He won&rsquo;t actually dip into his &#8220;stash&#8221; (e.g. your pocket) in a big way for non-whites until his second term. </p>

		<p>June, I must disagree with you on one point. Lack of employment doesn&rsquo;t cause most crime. Lack of employment and opportunities doesn&rsquo;t give someone the nerve to point a gun at another person, much less shoot one. It takes a pretty messed up individual to do something like that, so I don&rsquo;t believe that an increase in job availability will cause a sharp decrease in violent crime. If only our Black liberals would consider such things! Besides, it&rsquo;s interesting that so many &#8220;poor&#8221; people who can&rsquo;t afford to feed their families can afford to buy guns. In their defense, a gun is not so much a purchase as it is an investment, since they can use that gun to make even more money than what they spent on it, Ha! </p>
<p>Anyway, increased job availability may cause a decrease in the number of people shoplifting food in supermarkets, perhaps. I don&rsquo;t blame anyone who can&rsquo;t feed their children and steals food to do so. It can be argued that such persons are wrong for having children they can&rsquo;t support, but not all such people fit that description. Some people are out of work through no fault of their own. Some women have children who have been abandoned by the losers they mated with. When your child is starving, most other considerations take the back burner, but I don&rsquo;t believe most of this nation&rsquo;s criminal population falls into that category.</p>

<p>I agree with you.  While poverty can cause some crimes (and you listed a set which does increase slightly in recessions), it is more true that crime causes poverty.  Even a luminary (no pun int&rsquo;d) like Barack Obama agrees with me:</p>
