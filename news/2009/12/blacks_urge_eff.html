<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34455191/ns/us_news-race_and_ethnicity/">Blacks Urge Effort to Improve Census Count</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, December 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The National Urban League, the NAACP, Revs. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson met with Commerce Secretary Gary Locke to voice their concerns the Census Bureau might not be doing enough to ensure an accurate tally. Roughly 3 million blacks were missed in 2000, while many whites were overcounted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The undercount of blacks in the last count and the overcount of whites by 1 percent is not just a Washington statistic,&#8221; Sharpton said at a news briefing after the meeting. &#8220;It manifests itself in goods and services that cost us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want what is ours,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The groups called for the Census Bureau, an agency of the Commerce Department, to expand its paid advertising to cities such as Newark, N.J.; Oakland, Calif.; parts of Mississippi and other areas that have high percentages of hard-to-count blacks, many of whom are distrustful of government workers.</p>
<p><b>Pushing for more funding</b></p>
<p>They also are pushing for more census funding specifically targeted at black communities. About $23 million, or roughly 17 percent of the $133 million allocated for media buys, is currently earmarked for black communities to promote the census.</p>
<p>The black leaders said they wanted to see a change in how the government tallies prisoners, so they are counted as residents of the cities in which they previously lived, not in the places where a prison is located.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot more things that have to be done for us to say that we are confident that this plan can address the historic undercount in this nation,&#8221; said Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League and chair of the 2010 Census Advisory Committee.</p>

		<p>I agree with this.  We might get a more accurate count on how black America is.  Blacks predominate almost every major city   &mdash;   in fact, the list of major cities where blacks don&rsquo;t dominate its central core is so small that I can only think of one (Phoenix), and don&rsquo;t forge the Black Belt in the rural alluvial South from VA to eastern TX, and yet they&rsquo;re supposedly only 13% of the population.  I think it&rsquo;s more like 17%.</p>

<p>We already gave you Liberia, what else do you want? I think what Sharpton really means is that he wants what is OURS (white property, women and treasure)</p>

<p>Well, why stop there?</p>
<p>Why not count blacks who have moved from one city to another (from say Detroit to Grand Rapids) twice? Or why not count blacks who have moved from one state to another twice; or for that matter, why not count all deceased blacks in a graveyard, in a specific area as being the &lsquo;mortality deprived&rsquo; and inflating their numbers that way?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

		<p> Where does MSNBC get this bald statement that &#8220;more than 3 million blacks were undercounted, while many whites were overcounted&#8221;? If the blacks weren&rsquo;t counted, then how do they know how many there WERE that weren&rsquo;t counted? If the Whites were overcounted, the same question applies. And by the way, what the heck does &#8220;overcounted&#8221; mean in a census? Is it like all those people in Chicago who routinely vote from the cemetery?</p>
<p> If urban blacks are &#8220;hard to count,&#8221; that probably means that either, (a) they won&rsquo;t cooperate with the census takers; (b) the census takers are leery of going into many neighborhoods for fear of not surviving to turn in their results; or (c) both of the above. So how does that make it incumbent upon the government to &#8220;try harder&#8221; to count them?</p>

		<p>John PM:  Here in Philadelphia there are inner-city precincts in which I suspect the average age of the denizens in 134, the fabled &#8220;grave-yard vote,&#8221; which results from the dead never being stricken from the voter rolls.  Voter ID checks are sporadic and haphazard at best, and any given voter may be using Uncle Willie&rsquo;s driver&rsquo;s license with a birthdate of 1908 on it. The license may be expired, just as its owner is, but it still serves as a legiitimate form of voter ID.</p>
<p>Voter fraud is epidemic in the inner-city precincts and nobody seems interested in stopping it, characterizing it as a &#8220;victimless&#8221; crime.  Of, so-called voter disenfranchisement is viewed as the most heinous of crimes, though it never seems to occur to the authorities in the inner cities that every fraudulent vote cast cancels out a legitimate opposing vote, thus disenfranchising that voter.</p>
<p>Of course, that voter was probably a racist white, whose vote shouldn&rsquo;t count anyway.</p>

<p>You may be right Question Diversity, but once you get out of any major urban center you almost never see a black person. Even in heavily black Southern states this is true, when is the last time you saw a black in rural Georgia, Alabama or Louisiana. A sad thing that I noticed traveling through Eastern Texas in the last couple of years was the Hispanic influx. While there were always Hispanics in the larger cities like Houston or Dallas the small towns in far Eastern Texas (More Southern than what you would typically think of as Texas) were largely White with a small percentage of Blacks. </p>
<p>A footnote, there is a poster at the gym where I go in Spanish urging Census participation so that they will be represented in Congress. I have not noticed the same poster in English.</p>

		<p>To john of post #5, regarding: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, that voter was probably a racist white, whose vote shouldn&rsquo;t count anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An interesting point john; however, given the history of the &ldquo;living dead&rdquo; vote in this country, I would suspect that there are a lot of  &ldquo;undead&rdquo; whites that are quite equal to their counterparts of color today. Heck, I would suspect that such a voting bloc has had considerable equality since about 1908.</p>
<p>That is, they all probably morbidly vote equally for Democrat candidates! </p>
<p>All the best to you john,</p>

		<p>So, Big Al said:&ldquo;We want what is ours&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s okay, as long as Al Sharpton and his ilk get what is theirs, and stick to that, without trying to get a piece of what belongs to others. </p>

<p>This is an outright lie, but not surprising, considering who said it.  &#8220;Non-Hispanic Whites&#8221; came in as 69.1% of the population in 2000, however, after adjusting for inaccuracies, the Census Bureau determined it was actually 69.4%  &mdash;  so the percentage went UP, not down, even though probably most of the undercounted &#8220;whites&#8221; were probably people that most of us would not consider White, but whatever.</p>

		<p> but once you get out of any major urban center you almost never see a black person.</p>
<p>In South Carolina, once you leave the cities, which are predominantly black, and drive on any highway, for example Hwy 17 it would seem that blacks own the entire length of the Hwy between everywhere, school buses full of blacks, city buses full of blacks, blacks interfering with traffic and such so I wonder, WHAT rural areas are you moving about in. And to poster #1, I agree but differ in that I believe the % of blacks in the U.S. is more like 45%..One can see much more of the country from the seat of a Harley Davidson.</p>

		<p>Why does anyone agree to meet with these two stooges (Sharpton &amp; Jackson)? This only gives them some level of legitimacy and relevance. Since when does anyone, anywhere in any position need to answer to either one of them? The spineless Secretary Locke should have told them to take a hike when they requested a meeting. </p>

		<p>Anyone has read about how the census is taken knows that the government bends over backwards to count blacks, illegals and the homeless. They don&rsquo;t really care that much if they undercount Whites. They just have to get the numbers of their real constituents to improve. </p>
<p>For blacks, it&rsquo;s &#8220;What mine is mine, and what&rsquo;s yours is mine.&#8221; What is the end of reparations? When the last White man is gone, and the entire world is just one big Capetown.</p>
