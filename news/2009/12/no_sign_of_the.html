<h1>No Sign of the &#8216;Sea-Broken People&rsquo;?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ian Jack, Guardian (London), December 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At the climate change protest in London last Saturday, billed as the Big (or Blue) Wave, one feature was striking. The protestors had done their best to look blue as instructed  &mdash;  blue face-paint, blue wigs, blue bobble-hats  &mdash;  but underneath the blueness nearly everyone was white. In a crowd of 50,000 (the organisers&rsquo; estimate) I saw no more than a couple of dozen black people, and of that number hardly anyone at all who looked to have south Asian ancestry. We were white and we were middle class, and we might have been marching from Aldermaston to Trafalgar Square through the different, paler England of 1961.</p>
<p>As London is now probably the world&rsquo;s most ethnically diverse city and this is a global crisis like no other, why had so much of the globe stayed away? Two people in a good position to know are Ashok Sinha, the director of the Stop Climate Chaos coalition that organised last weekend&rsquo;s protest, and Andrew Murray, who chairs the Stop the War movement that had unprecedented success in terms of the social, racial and religious diversity provided noticeably by its Muslim support. Their answers were similar. In Sinha&rsquo;s words, this was a &#8220;complicated question&#8221; entangled in the wider problems of social class and communal division and the particular nature of the environmental lobby. You couldn&rsquo;t just go into a community and hope to proselytize, he said; the persuaders  &mdash;  imams, for example  &mdash;  had to come from within. Murray said that his movement&rsquo;s backing by the Muslim Association of Great Britain had helped it embrace poorer people as well as different races, while the campaign against global warming remained undeniably middle class: &#8220;What agitates north London can bypass east London entirely.&#8221;</p>
<p>All no doubt true, though Britain has at least two Muslim groups, Islamic Relief and the Islamic Foundation for Ecology and the Environmental Sciences, both based in Birmingham, which seek to protect the environment by &#8220;eco-jihad&#8221;. How popular they are is difficult to know, but to judge by Saturday&rsquo;s march they have yet to make an impact on London. Two sets of figures are worth considering. London has about 200,000 citizens of Bangladeshi Muslim origin; Bengali is the most common language in the city after English. In Bangladesh itself, at least 20 million people are predicted to be displaced by rising sea levels within the next 40 years; nowhere else in the world do so many people face such an immediate future as climate refugees: &#8220;climigrants&#8221;. Does the fate of the second affect the behaviour of the first? It would be dangerous to generalise. All one can say is not visibly, not at least in public protests against carbon emissions, and yet these two populations are bound by language, religion and national history. Palestine, Kashmir, Iraq, Qur&rsquo;anic blasphemy: all these causes are much more likely to get a crowd out in Brick Lane as well as in Barisal, a town on the Bengal delta marked down for a submarine future.</p>
<p>You might call this a paradox of pan-Islamism  &mdash;  its promise of social unity can never be completely fulfilled  &mdash;  but then the state of Bangladesh has been wrestling with the same paradox since its original foundation as East Pakistan. In the end, a different language, culture and economy overpowered its one bond with West Pakistan, which was a shared religion. And within Bangladesh, too, there are big differences. Nine out of 10 British Bangladeshis have their roots in Sylhet, a relatively prosperous district in the far north-east with its distinct variant of Bengali and those national rarities, hills. The expected inundation will occur much further south, in the low flat country built into the Bay of Bengal by the sediment brought down by the rush of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers.</p>
<p>Very few Bangladeshis in Britain come from that part; there is such a thing as being too poor to migrate. Life there has always been difficult, because the combination of air, water and land is so dynamic. Cyclones blow in from the sea; one in 1970 killed half a million. In the past, great rivers have broken through to new channels in the course of a night, destroying villages, throwing up fresh sandbanks and new islands, so that the very landscape seemed temporary; and not in ancient times  &mdash;  one of the Ganges&rsquo; great changes of direction occurred in the 18th century  &mdash;  and by no means yet over.</p>
<p>A memorable account of this fragile civilisation was published in 1876 by an imperial civil servant, Henry Beveridge, who worked as the chief official of the Bakarganj district, now Barisal. The district, he wrote, had always been neglected and despised. It had produced no history, hardly any &#8220;resident aristocracy&#8221; and no art of any kind. The climate was damp and steamy. Fever and dysentery prevailed. The soles of boatmen&rsquo;s bare feet were holed with ringworm, like a sponge. Perhaps the most desolate sight, however, were the foundations of houses that had been abandoned near riverbanks, when the river had looked likely to change its course. Beveridge wrote, &#8220;When the peasants are thus driven away by the rivers, they sometimes merely move further inland; but when they cannot get fresh land there, they are obliged to move to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. distant parts of the country. They are sometimes expressively called nadi-bhanga lok, ie, river-broken people.&#8221;</p>
<p>I first read Beveridge in the national archive in Dhaka 20 years ago, and remembered him again this week when I watched an interview with Bangladesh&rsquo;s finance minister at Guardian online. Abul Maal Abdul Muhith gave the figure of 20 million people displaced by flood, erosion and salinity, though as he said the figure could be much higher owing to the country&rsquo;s population growth (rising from about 160 million to 256 million by 2050, according to UN projections). He wanted international law to define them as a new category of refugee, the climate refugee, so that their migration to the UK and elsewhere could be managed. &#8220;We can help, in the sense of giving them some training, making them fit for existence in another country,&#8221; Muhith said, and in that &#8220;them&#8221; I caught the same sense of distant, helpless compassion  &mdash;  for a situation beyond government control  &mdash;  as Beveridge applied to his river-broken people.</p>
<p>Other than in global institutions such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that are not directly answerable to national electorates, the response to Muhith&rsquo;s radical suggestion has been silence. Which state, which of us, wants to take aboard millions of sea-broken people? India has already half-completed a fence of concrete and barbed wire, 2.5 metres (10ft) high and manned by border patrols, which will eventually surround Bangladesh. Whatever happens at Copenhagen, the landmass of Bangladesh seems bound to shrink. It may be that intuiting this truth is what makes Brick Lane stay at home while the white folks wave at the Houses of Parliament, and whistle in the dark.<br>

		<p>This is the sort of thing we need to emphasize more   &mdash;   limousine liberal issues like environmentalism have little minority participation.  Modern liberalism is a bastard child of minorities voting themselves money (either from government or through diversity initiatives) and educated whites who don&rsquo;t have to live with them, and are happy to trade each other votes on issues irrelevant to the counter-party.</p>

		<p>Even though man-made global warming (MMGW) has been pretty much exposed as a hoax, whose adherents still cling to it as if they&rsquo;ll wind up in the bad place way down there if they don&rsquo;t, the only question that remains is this:  What is the powerful force that demands that society adhere to the religious faith of MMGW, and why?  I think it&rsquo;s big corporations who want people to tolerate less pay, so they fete the excuse of MMGW in order to coax people that they have to contend with a lower standard of living.  Now that that bromide is gone, how will the corporate elite next convince us to be corporate slaves?  Answer:  mass non-white immigration.  Expect for their shill politicians to push hot and heavy for amnesty and open borders next year.  The pro-invader invective and demagoguery and sob stories is going to come at us fast and furious   &mdash;   all four barrels.  You can bet the ADL and SPLC will help in &#8220;firing&#8221; said &#8220;barrels.&#8221;  Get ready for it.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, the reason that very few minorities are protesting climate change is because it requires the consideration and altruism that only a person with a developed frontal lobe can have.  </p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t they promulgate population control in Bangladesh instead? Having some 160 million people living in a country the size of Wisconsin is asking for trouble. It would be challenging if Bangladesh were prosperous, but it is one of the poorest countries in the world. Throw in the cyclones and flooding, and you have an absolute basket case.</p>
<p>Since the human body temperature is 98.6 degrees F, multiply that by 160 million, and there you have the reason for climate change.</p>

		<p>Different races create different cultures.  The leftists will try to tell you that all cultures are of equal value and that they are all interchangeable   &mdash;   i.e., If France becomes primarily Muslim, or if California becomes primarily &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; (=MesoAmerican Indian), then that doesn&rsquo;t matter, because all cultures are OK.  </p>
<p>However, in truth, the different cultures are radically different in nearly everything, including the ability to create freedom, opportunity, health, stability, safety, high culture, and a high standard of living.  One can test this law by simply examining the culture created by Africans wherever on the planet they go.</p>
<p>Conservation is an almost exclusively White concern.  As European-derived populations are replaced by non-European people, the ecology movement will die, along with whales, hippos, gorillas, rhinos, and other bushmeat.  </p>

		<p>A few months back, another reader commented that once we Whites have been eliminated, our technologies will persist just long enough for them to be used by blacks and browns, to kill the planet.  And I didn&rsquo;t need this article to confirm that prediction for me.</p>
<p>I became a race realist when I noticed that the Environmental movement (and, indeed, even the notion of Ecology)is entirely a White thing.  And now that I know we Whites are being sold-out by our own governments, I have become OPPOSED to Environmentalism.  As soon as we&rsquo;re gone, the world is doomed.</p>

		<p>I found that over half of the comments, maybe even well over half of them though I wasn&rsquo;t keeping close tabs, were of a similar mind to most of us here on AmRen.  I find it encouraging to see so many posts lampooning multiculti and the anxiety that it&rsquo;s failure causes for the leftists who have invested their lives in it and made it their religion.  Let&rsquo;s just hope that those of us who are more realistic can successfully clean up the mess they&rsquo;ve left us with.</p>

		<p>Whites are the ones concerned about the environment.  <br>
Whites are the ones concerned about &#8220;global warming&#8221;.  <br>
Whites are the ones concerned about over population.  <br>
Whites are the ones concerned about pollution.  <br>
Whites are the ones concerned about extinction of different species of animals.  <br>
Whites are the ones concerned about civil rights (of other races).<br>
Whites are the ones that adopt babies of other races.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not wrong to be concerned about this planet.  However it is quite foolish to be concerned about the rights of every other group except ones&rsquo; own and to even frown upon looking at your own race as &#8220;your group&#8221; and to feel guilty for it.  White people are going to have to realize their shortcomings very soon or there isn&rsquo;t going to be any more White race in the future.</p>

		<p>I find it encouraging that at least some groups haven&rsquo;t bought into the greatest scientific fraud of all time, the great global warming hoax.  Hmm, make that the greatest fraud, period.</p>
<p>The notion that CO-2, at 380 ppm, that&rsquo;s four-one hundredths of one percent of the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, could have any significant effect on global temperatures is absurd on its face.  It&rsquo;s analogous to trying to raise the temperature of a 40,000 gallon home swimming pool by occasionally tossing a quart of warm tap water into it.</p>
<p>The fraud illustrates the dangers of funding scientific research with government money, proffered by agenda-driven politicians who hunger to control every aspect of our lives.  &#8220;Hey, who wants $10 million to prove there&rsquo;s (wink, wink) global warming?&#8221;</p>
<p>Anybody who thinks scientists who live off government grants are incorruptible is naive in the extreme.  These same scientists hope to assume high positions in the newly created bureaucracies that will have full authority to completely re-order our lives.</p>
<p>If successful the global warming fraud will destroy western civilization as we know it.  The world, of course, will go on, with us as the vassals of Asia.</p>

		<p>There is a strong interest in the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference from minorities, but from minorities in their own countries.<br>
The ostensible objective of the CCCC is to reduce (very slightly) global warming by reducing the manmade carbon footprint. The results of this will be insignificant, even if manmade activity does have a palpable effect on global warming  &mdash;  something which may, or may not, be the case.<br>
However, one effect of the Conference, if it succeeds, will be devastating. This is the massive shift of treasure from the West, which will pay for all of the carbon reduction policies, to the Third World, which will pay for none of them and will receive heavy subsidies. Think 45 trillion dollars (yes, trillion!) over the coming years and decades. This may or may not include the hundreds of billions of dollars in &#8220;reparations&#8221; to the Third World from the West to &#8220;compensate&#8221; for past years of pollution. (And we thought only American blacks were on the reparations bandwagon!)<br>
The result will be disaster. The taxes necessary to pay for all this will cripple the West economically. We will face the bizarre situation of the West having to *borrow* more from China (which counts as a Thirld World country for climate control purposes) to *pay* China.<br>
The one thing we could do to limit carbon emissions is something that is, strangely, not being contemplated by the CCCC: this is to control population size and is something that could be done very cheaply. Western countries should stop all immigration, legal and illegal, and deport all &#8220;welfare tourists,&#8221; &#8220;asylum seekers,&#8221; and other alien undesirables. Population would fall and the carbon imprint would be reduced.<br>
At the same time, some foreign aid could be given to encourage Thirld World countries to limit their populations through sterilization, birth control, and an awareness that the West will no longer feed their accelerating populations.<br>
The CCCC is about torpedoing the economies of the West and turning the world into a global proletariat.</p>

Well, maybe if your co-conspirators at NuLabour hadn&rsquo;t flooded the country with blacks and browns   &mdash;   &#8220;to rub the Right&rsquo;s nose in Diversity&#8221; was the quote   &mdash;   there might still be some WHITE people in east London to help you with your eco-agitation.</p>
<p>Instead, whites have been ethnically cleansed from east London&hellip; as well as much of south London and even west London. </p>
<p>And unless you left-wing Luvvies in smug, wealthy north London start thinking more about Britain and blood than about bunnies and bears, the ethnic cleansing is headed to YOUR part of town too. And the resultant catastrophes will strike a lot sooner than the exaggerated and/or imaginary MMGW disasters that you&rsquo;re currently wringing your soft pink hands over. </p>

		<p>   Perhaps global warming bears watching, but liberals want to turn it into a pseudo religion laden with new taxes, whose detractors are fined, branded &#8220;global warming deniers,&#8221; and imprisoned . The same crowd was predicting a new ice age in the seventies &hellip;.? North America and Asia recently experienced record cold winters, we do not know what the polar caps have been doing over the millennia because we have only been able to monitor them for the last hundred years,and even then not very well.Southern Bangladesh ? They&rsquo;ve always been at the mercy of the sea and from the preponderance ofsubmerged ancient ruins, I would say Bangladesh was not the first nor will they be the last.It kind of goes with water front property . And if we turn the globe into one giant windmill farm, how do we know that we are not disrupting cleansing air currents, causing it&rsquo;s own unique pollution ? The largest unit available right now is 2.5 MW, that&rsquo;s a thimble full. I mean every little bit helps, but come on . My problem or problems, is that we are using up valuable resources in burning our fossil fuels that should be reserved for synthetics to build things .A 4000 megawatt plant burns a mountain of coal on every hour . And all the waste of taxpayers money, over 300 billion for Vietnam and now over 300 billion for the war on terror, what will it get us ? If we had spent that on fusion and cold fusion research would we now have fusion power plants ? I think so . We blew up a fusion device 60 years ago, surely if we really tried by now we would be able harness it&rsquo;s power for more constructive purposes. And that&rsquo;s what we really need . Windmills and solar ? unless there is really a phenomenal breakthrough in technology, they&rsquo;re just interesting toys . Fusion, we&rsquo;ve got to have it and we can . It&rsquo;s just a matter of getting our priorities straight .    </p>

<p>India has already completed that fence surrounding Bangla. 4,000 kilometers [2,500 miles] long, DOUBLE fence the space between the two fences filled with razor wire, a fence lit at night and patrolled by squads of soldiers armed with assault rifles.</p>
<p>INDIA DOES NOT WANT PROGRESS STOPPED BY TENS OF MILLIONS OF FLEEING BANGLA REFUGEES!!</p>
<p>The British Admiral Parry has stated that the one place in the world most susceptible for total societal breakdown is Bangla. Rising sea levels, teeming and restive population, Islamic fundamentalism, storms brewing out of the Bay of Bengal, etc.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;What is the powerful force that demands society adhere to the religious faith of man-made global warming?&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Question Diversity</p>
<p>The answer to your question is an easy one: socialism.</p>
<p>Socialists once demanded that they be allowed to control the economies of the developed West so they could establish &#8220;social justice&#8221; (whatever that is).  Now they are demanding control of the economies of the developed West so they can prevent man-made global warming, recently revealed to be an enormous man-made global hoax.  Fundamentally, these opportunists DO NOT CARE what excuse presents itself to them; they merely want control of the economies of the developed West.  Their excuses, whether &#8220;social justice&#8221; or &#8220;global warming&#8221; are merely packaging.</p>
