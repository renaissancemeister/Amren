<h1><a href="https://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/national_world&amp;id=7193577">Debating &#8216;Predictive&rsquo; Versus Racial Profiling</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Miriam Hernandez, KABC-TV (Los Angeles), December 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines flight Christmas Day brings up new questions about the controversial profiling of airline passengers.</p>
<p>The debate comes up whenever there is a terrorist incident. New safety rules are imposed, all passengers are delayed. The question is raised: Why not scrutinize all people based on race if it is a matter of saving lives?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Is stereotyping OK? Aviation-safety specialist Barry Schiff has long been an advocate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have not been attacked by Swedish girls, for example,&#8221; said Schiff. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve been attacked by Muslim men.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brandes is a security specialist. He spent years with EL AL Airlines, an Israeli company, which has a record of deterring terrorists. But he says racial profiling is wrong-headed. Instead, he pushes &#8220;predictive profiling.&#8221; It involves first knowing the methods of the attackers, from how they conceal bombs to how they try to blend in.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Armed with this information, an interviewer talks to each passenger.</p>
<p>&#8220;People think, &#8216;Well, do we have time to do that?&rsquo; Yes, we do. We do have time. People stand in lines,&#8221; said Brandes.</p>
<p>He demonstrates why racial profiling doesn&rsquo;t work: Kozo Okamoto headed an attack at an airport in Israel. A Palestinian group hired the Japanese man because he didn&rsquo;t look Palestinian.</p>
<p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations points out other terrorists who buck the racial profile.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As for improving screening technology, Brandes says: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know of one incident where a terrorist was found first by looking for the explosives, the weapons, and then looking for the intent.&#8221;</p>
<p>One more reason to discourage racial profiling: Muslim civil-rights advocates say it alienates Muslims, the very people the government depends on to gather intelligence.</p>

		<p>One point is missed. No one is claiming that only a mid-eastern looking man or woman would attempt a terror attack, but that by profiling you are more likely to catch a suicide bomber than by not profiling and that profiling makes it harder for the Muslim terrorists to bring off an attack. Finding a Caucasian Muslim convert, for instance, for suicide is not as easy. Clearly all methods should be used and peaceful Muslims just have to be understanding.</p>
<p>Besides, why are non-Muslims required to be hyper-sensitive toward someone who believes his or her god forbids them to befriend non-Muslims (in several places in the Koran)and claims that infidels are hell bound anyway and &#8220;the worst of creatures&#8221; (Sura 98:6)?</p>

<p>That means we have to clear our anti-terrorism techniques with Muslim groups?  </p>
<p>The problem with genuflecting to predictive profiling, at least in the long run, is that while it might pass the muster of civil rights lawyers and loudmouth activist groups in the short run, the net result of predictive profiling will mean that certain racial groups will be inconvenienced, i.e. disparate impact.  Eventually, Muslim groups will oppose predictive profiling just as much as they do explicit racial profiling.</p>

		<p>Why can&rsquo;t we individually profile?  Demand a passenger manifest and photos from the airline of your flight in advance, and if there&rsquo;s anyone you don&rsquo;t feel comfortable being on a plane with, notify the airline and obtain a refund.  Make your ticket contingent upon preapproval of everyone on the flight.</p>

		<p>The November 1993 attack on the Twin Towers was completely avoidable. 9/11 was completely avoidable. The attempt to blow up the jetliner in Detroit was completely avoidable. If the pre-1965 national origins immigration policy had remained in place, the above three terrorist attacks on America soil would have never have occurred. I other words, the probability of these events occurring would have been 0.</p>
<p>The only way that a future terrorist attack on US soil can be prevented is 1)a national origins policy that excludes muslims and 2)the mass deportation of all muslims.</p>
<p>If either a nuclear bomb is detonated in a major American city or 2) a nuclear power plant is blown up, 1) and 2) will be implemented immediately..or there will be a revolution.</p>
<p>So&hellip;why are muslims allowed to continue to migrate to OUR AMERICA? What is the justification for muslim LEGAL IMMIGRANTS? WE need muslim doctors,engineers,plumbers,carpenters,computer programmers,nurses&hellip;NCULEAR SUBMARINE commanders? It is a bold-face lie. It is complete full-blown nutty insanity.</p>
<p>US foriegn policy and LEGAL IMMIGRATION go hand-in-hand. US intentions are benign an noble. America is going to turn Afghanistan into a Liberal social demcoracy where homosexual marriage will be legalized. And to prove America&rsquo;s are benign and noble, look no further than America&rsquo;s immigration-LEGAL-policy. </p>
<p>The muslim Nigerian LEGAL IMMIGRANT attempted to blow up an international airliner that landed in Detroit. Thanks to post-1965 immigration policy,there now one million muslims living in Detroit and the surrounding suburbs.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a neat trick. Someone in a community rapes, murders, or robs someone from another community, and that community NOT only gets away with physically attacking the other one, but THEN pre-emptively accuses them of profiling them and participating in a &#8220;racist backlash.&#8221; </p>
<p>See, that wasn&rsquo;t &#8216;racist&rsquo; at all, because I didn&rsquo;t blame any particular group of this. Despite the influence of all you nasty &#8216;racists&rsquo; there is hope for me yet. </p>

		<p>The arabic islamofacists used a black because he would draw less scrutiny and it worked perfectly.Too bad for them, the attempt failed because of the diligence of other passengers, and black ineptitude.</p>

		<p>From the Twin-Towers in 1993 going forward the attacks are from young middle-eastern looking men.   Wouldn&rsquo;t it make a lot of sense to mainly concentrate on passengers that fit this profile rather than grandmothers, etc.  Has the society become so PC that it is devoid of common sense.</p>

		<p>Peejay in Frisco. I couldn&rsquo;t have said it better myself. I told people at work that using the black was a double-edge sword. If the Arab leaders lost him, he&rsquo;s not one of their own anyway. He did the dirty work that they didn&rsquo;t want to do. But the price to pay is that urban black street thugs, no matter what country they are from, do not typically have the &#8220;smarts&#8221; to pull something like this off. That&rsquo;s why black Muslims in this country will never be accepted by true Muslims in the Arab world. They think too much of themselves, and not enough about the mission. To conquer the infidels. </p>

<p>Did you really have to go there?  Well you are from SF so maybe you are trolling from flames or whatever.  <br>
I find your last comment very offensive and I am one of those &#8220;angry white men&#8221; that some in the media love to bash.  To classify any group as inept is in itself trolling for flames et al and deservedly so.   </p>

<p>Oh? And you can discern who is or isn&rsquo;t Muslim by sight? Muslim is a religious group - what we need to profile are various groups of non-whites, Arabic, African, etc., who happen to practice Islam. Worrying about &#8220;Muslims&#8221; is far too broad and meaningless a categorization.  </p>

		<p>    Regarding the attempted destruction of the airliner on Christmas Day, no media outlet or personage has really commented on the unmitigated provocation of attempting this terror act on this particular day, compounding insult and injury to Christiandom.  In WW-1, there were Christmas truces on the Western front during which the British &amp; German soldiers came out of their trenches to socialize, exchange small gifts and act in a christian manner. In WW-2 there wa a documented incident in Stalingrad where Wehrmacht and Red Army soldiers did the same.  </p>
<p>    Our forces in the Mid-East are annually issued orders for the moslem holidays such as ramadan, along with guidelines to behave respectfully to the locals. </p>
<p>   Also, the focus of the terrorists boarding of the plane has shifted from violating all the known alert profiles (cash purchase, one way ticket, no passport) to the use of the Body Scanner machines.  This shows the depth of greed which comes from, in this case, the company which makes these expensive machines &amp; has been lobbying to get them installed at every airport in the world. Additionally, Holland is infested with South Moluccans from their former colony in Indonesia, and anyone who has traveled in Western Europe will noted that the airports, their, including, Schilpol, Heathrow and Degaulle are staffed almost exclusively by third worlders.   Imagine JFK or Newark times a thousand. It will be interesting to see how far the investigation will go, but we can guess.Kipling&rsquo;s poem &#8220;The Stranger&#8221; is  germane in this incident.</p>
<p><br>
The moronic reporters only read what is fed to them via their editors, and are too stupid to do anything but parrot the party line. Looks like a good investment, and since some reports indicate that Al queda has already bought a machine for their training camp, the full body scanner will be as effective as the<br>
&#8216;puff explosives&rsquo; detector.  Another in the long line of money making scams and security gestures ushered in by government / lobby greed complex; such as the anthrax, H1N1, TWIC card to name but three. It is heartbreaking to see our country plummet downward, now is the harvest of fruits of the left&rsquo;s long march through academia, judiciary, now politics. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;We have not been attacked by Swedish girls, for example,&rdquo; said Schiff. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been attacked by Muslim men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just to inject a little levity here, the concept of being &#8220;attacked&#8221; by Swedish girls is not exactly an abhorrent thought depending on the circumstances so long as they&rsquo;re not armed with golf clubs.</p>
<p>Now for the serious matter. Schiff&rsquo;s statement is ironic given the number of Swedish girls who&rsquo;ve been attacked by Muslim &#8220;men&#8221; (to use the term in its loosest interpretation).<br>
Our PC will be our undoing.</p>

		<p>Racial profiling is designed to take away the easiest method for a terrorist to attack. No one is saying that we shouldn&rsquo;t scrutinize ALL passengers. It only makes sense to scrutinize certain passengers to a higher degree due to the statistical data on who a terrorist is likely to be.</p>
<p>Nay-sayers will always throw extreme situations in the face of common sense solutions to shut them down. It only works if we accept the nay-sayer&rsquo;s parameters of the debate. The one who sets the rules will ALWAYS give themselves an advantage; Leaving common sense at the door.</p>

<p>Daood and Rana the Kinsman, IL., USA terrorists, owned the goat and sheep ranch and slaughterhouse and were within probably fifteen to twenty minutes driving time of two nuclear plants and a nuclear storage facility. Plants and a storage facilty that are about 60 to 70 miles from Chi. A good southwest wind blowing toward Chi after an attack on one of these facilities [or multiple facilities simultaneously] and you would have to evacuate about 7 million folks!! Think about it!!</p>

		<p>One thing we have learned from all of this is how ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED our governmental authorities are to Political Correctness and to Diversity.  They are rigid and inflexible on that point;  nothing can interfere with it.  NOTHING!</p>
<p>Nine years ago, who would have believed that after the disaster of 9/11 we would STILL be denying the obvious in a desperate effort to shield the suspect groups?  That we would STILL be allowing them to pour into this country?  That our borders would still be open, our immigration policies generous and almost uncontrolled?  That we would STILL be prattling about the &#8220;religion of peace&#8221; (from a group that we&rsquo;re at war with).  That we would STILL be frisking 80-year old grannies and 3-year old toddlers, in a silly pretense that ANYONE can be a terrorist!  Well, anyone CAN, but how many ARE?</p>
<p>Question: How many grannies and toddlers have been caught as terrorists thus far?  None, you say?  <br>
Well, how many young men from Africa/the Middle East?   ALL the terrorists, you say?   Well, well&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t that sort of tell us something?</p>
<p>WHEN will we wake up and become realistic?  When a nuclear device actually obliterates an American city?  Our leaders&rsquo; ideological commitment to the false god of Diversity is absolutely astounding. The world must think we&rsquo;ve gone mad.</p>
