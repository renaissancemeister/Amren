<h1>L.A. Gangs Seek Profit in Peace</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tamara Audi, Wall Street Journal, December 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gangs that were once bloody rivals now are cooperating to wring profits from the sale of illegal drugs and weapons, law-enforcement officials and gang experts say. In some cases, gangs that investigators believed to be sworn enemies share neighborhoods and strike business deals. The collaboration even crosses racial lines, remarkable in a gang world where racial divisions are sharp and clashes are often racially motivated.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see African-Americans dealing with Hispanics on obtaining narcotics and weapons. We&rsquo;re seeing Hispanic gang members involved with the Eastern European criminal figures,&#8221; said Robert W. Clark, acting special agent in charge of the criminal division of the Los Angeles field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. &#8220;Where they see opportunities to collaborate, they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But gang-related violence is at a 30-year low in Los Angeles, according to experts. Gang-related homicides in Los Angeles totaled 128 in through October of this year, compared with 312 in all of 2002. All reported gang-related crimes, including rape, assault and robberies, totaled 4,899 through October, compared with 7,432 in 2002.</p>
<p>The sharp drop is undoubtedly a landmark success for law-enforcement officials and policy makers, who have used aggressive policing and rehabilitation programs to tackle the problem. But the reports of alliances between formerly warring gangs potentially offers a different explanation: Gangs are committing less violence because they are partnering on criminal activity, creating new challenges for law enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, instead of having 200 guys that are arch-enemies with 200 other guys, you have 400 guys working together against law enforcement,&#8221; said the sheriff&rsquo;s detective, Mr. Lyons.</p>
<p>There are still plenty of rivalries and violence. One Los Angeles-area Latino gang, Barrio Hawaiian Gardens, was charged this spring with hate crimes against African-Americans  &mdash;  including targeted shootings.</p>
<p>And the number of gang members has been on the upswing nationally. There were about one million gang members in the U.S. in 2008, up from 800,000 in 2005, according to the National Gang Threat Assessment, compiled by the National Gang Intelligence Center and the National Drug Intelligence Center.</p>
<p>Some regions of the country  &mdash;  like New England, with 640 gangs  &mdash;  are seeing an increase in violence as gangs grow and fight for control of neighborhoods and the drug trade, the report said. But there is cohesion in other regions, like Washington and Oregon, where &#8220;alliances between gangs may result in the expansion of criminal networks and increased criminal activity in the Northwest Region,&#8221; the report says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But intensifying pressure from police has also prompted gangs to work together, said Jorja Leap, a University of California, Los Angeles professor and gang expert. &#8220;They really are united against what they perceive to be a common enemy  &mdash;  law enforcement,&#8221; said Ms. Leap, who now advises Los Angeles County Sheriff Leroy Baca on gangs.</p>
<p>Ms. Leap said gangs form links to survive  &mdash;  and to maximize profits. &#8220;The market is tougher and they&rsquo;re consolidating,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said gangs are &#8220;treating their activities more like businesses than before. In business, you work with whoever you have to.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During a two-year investigation of the Athens Park Bloods, an African-American gang entrenched in south Los Angeles, investigators learned the members had formed a pact with a Hispanic gang called Barrio 13. Eventually, 22 people were charged  &mdash;  20 African-Americans and two Hispanics.</p>

		<p>I think they know that law enforcement would crack down if the violence got too bad, so they&rsquo;re saving their own &#8220;industry&#8221; through tacit agreements to keep the &#8220;noise down.&#8221;  Similarly, a group of teenagers having a party at a house where the parents are gone aren&rsquo;t going to be too conspicuous, so as not to tip off the neighbors.</p>
<p>Another factor is that Hispanics have pretty much taken over most black areas of L.A.  Therefore, racial animus doesn&rsquo;t exist to the degree it used to because Hispanics have almost taken over the city.</p>

		<p>I often wonder where all the black people have gone from neighborhoods that were all black here in NYC just 15 year ago.  I am not joking, latinos are the majority in nearly every neighborhood in this city.  When I multiply this by the fact that latinos are basically becoming the majority in nearly all other major urban areas, and many suburbs too - I mean are there that many surplus people in latin america?  </p>
<p>Latin America, even mexico - those places must be ghost towns because they&rsquo;ve all come here.  My friends, we have passed the point of no return and we have lost our mother country.  All that remains is partition in a few decades.  You know it&rsquo;s true.  What ever rump state remains will then in turn be swamped by the majority non-whites on this continent.  Our civilization will scarcely get a mention 100 years from now in the textbooks published (in spanish) for the latinos who will be the new absolute majority in this land.</p>

<p>Hispanics ARE inundating Los Angeles, as well as other parts of California and they have spread across the US.  You&rsquo;re right about that, but that has only increased black/brown violence, not reduced it.  The blacks are still there, and the racial animus has gotten far worse today than at any other time in prior years. Even more disturbing is that the black/brown fighting can be found anywhere in the US where Hispanics and blacks reside in close proximity to one another.  </p>
<p>A search of the internet will turn up many news reports verifying the increase in black/brown violence, especially in Los Angeles and the rest of California.</p>
<p>Below are links to two articles explaining the situation, one from Lee Baca, L.A. County Sheriff, and one from the SPLC, that, for once, has it right.  It&rsquo;s their token story to prove they report on other racial clashes besides those involving whites.  It was written in 2005, but the situation has gotten even worse since then.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that blacks are going to be blacks no matter how many Hispanics move in, whether blacks are a majority or not.  The Hispanics refuse to be pushed around.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they&rsquo;re wrong. The truth is that, in many cases, race is at the heart of the problem. Latino gang members shoot blacks not because they&rsquo;re members of a rival gang but because of their skin color. Likewise, black gang members shoot Latinos because they are brown.&#8221;<br>

Evidence of a divide between blacks and Hispanics mounting<br>

<p>&#8220;One after another, the reports have rolled in. From Florida to California, Nevada to New Jersey, even as far away as the state of Washington, the news is getting harder to ignore: There&rsquo;s trouble brewing between blacks and browns.&#8221; <br>

		<p>I agree with you, Whiteraven.  I live in L.A. County, and trust me, there&rsquo;s plenty of gang activity out here in the Inland Empire.  If they took away the profits, the gang activity would diminish greatly.  Of course, the Asian gangs (the ones with brains) have always focused on the business aspect of crime - they rob their own people, and work with prostitution and gambling.  They make plenty of money without focusing on drugs.  But except for turf wars, which both Mexican and black gangs care about, there&rsquo;d be little reason to fight without drugs.  Only the Asian gangs would be unaffected.</p>

		<p>@Jon: California laws regulating gun ownership are so tough that, for a law-abiding citizen, guns are de facto illegal. </p>
<p>You can, however, carry one to the range IF it is unloaded, and locked in the trunk. </p>

<blockquote>
Can I continually carry a handgun in my car in a locked container other than the utility or glove compartment for self-defense? I do not have a concealed weapons permit.			
Written by Administrator

No. The legal authorization to transport a concealed handgun without a permit unloaded and in a motor vehicle&rsquo;s trunk or a separate locked container in Penal Code Section 12026.1 applies only while going to or from the specific places, and for the specific purposes, identified in Penal Code Section 12026.2 (going hunting, to or from a range, etc.). It is illegal to carry a concealed handgun without a permit for general purposes, such as self defense, even though the firearm is transported in the trunk of a motor vehicle or in a separate locked container. Section 12026.1 is not very clear on this point, but Section 12026.2 is, so it is prudent to read them together. Again, handguns being lawfully transported concealed in a motor vehicle&rsquo;s trunk or in a separate locked container cannot be loaded nor can ammunition be attached to them in any manner..</blockquote>
<p>The effect is one may safely assume any person who looks law-abiding is unarmed, because concealed carry permits are almost never granted. </p>
<p>The results: </p>
<p>*People pay top dollar to live in &#8216;good neighborhoods&rsquo; and civic enclaves with beefed up police departments. </p>
<p>*Urban areas are filled with swaggering toughs, who stalk around with hands in their pockets or tucked into their jackets while glaring about, clearly giving the signal that they&rsquo;re carrying a gun. </p>
<p>Remember, when in California ALWAYS show proper deference and respect towards your neighborhood thug   &mdash;   who is likely carrying a gun that you can not because you obey the law   &mdash;   unless it is a matter worth being shot over. </p>
<p>For example, a Hayward, California man was recently shot down in front of his adolescent daughter by an African-American when the white man&rsquo;s dog sniffed this person&rsquo;s leg, and an argument ensued.  </p>

		<p>My brother-in-law has a carry permit issued in Humboldt County, which is valid throughout California.  But In L.A., only show biz people and politicians can get them.  Many Whites carry anyway, and the police will often look the other way.  At least they did 20 years ago when I lived there.  Who knows what the Mexican cops they have now would do.  </p>

<p>The only intelligent thing to do is to carry the gun in your car regardless of what the law says. You save your life or the life of a oved one first and then fret over the consequences. If your attacker is a minority be sure either before or after shooting him, not to utter anything that could be construed as racist or bigoted should there be eye/ear witnesses.</p>

@Anonymous: A firearms violation could jeopardize one&rsquo;s ability to hold a job, vote, and possess firearms, which could be vital in a situation like a major earthquake. </p>
<p>While I believe California&rsquo;s firearms laws are unconstitutional, I would suggest folks obey them. You are more valuable to your families out of jail than in it. </p>
<p>Best to avoid troubled areas, dangerous occupations   &mdash;   such as running convenience stores, and walking on foot through any urban area. </p>
<p>And, frankly, if confronted with a dangerous situation in a car, your attacker will either have the drop on you   &mdash;   making reaching for a gun useless   &mdash;   or you will have the opportunity to floor it and motor away from, around, or through any trouble&hellip; one reason why massive SUVs remain so popular in California. </p>
