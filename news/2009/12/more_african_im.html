<h1>More African Immigrants Finding a Home in Latin America</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Luis Andres Henao, Miami Herald, Dec. 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} </p>
<p>As European countries tighten up border controls, more and more Africans fleeing war and poverty in their homelands are landing at ports in Latin America. While some arrive in Mexico as a stepping stone to reach the United States, others find themselves in Brazil and Argentina after sneaking aboard cargo ships in African ports they mistakenly thought were bound for Europe. </p>
<p>More than 3,000 African immigrants now live in Argentina, up from just a few dozen eight years ago, and almost a third of the nation&rsquo;s asylum seekers are from Africa. </p>
<p>&#8220;You never used to see an African man in the streets of Buenos Aires. It&rsquo;s a search for new destinations,&#8221; said Carolina Podesta from the Argentine office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. </p>
<p>BORDER CRACKDOWN</p>
<p>Migrants have also been forced to look for alternatives because of tougher immigration policies in European countries and a crackdown on border security since 9/11, Podesta said. </p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re seeing a tendency that&rsquo;s on the rise and that will continue growing,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>Immigrants, mainly from Senegal, Egypt, Nigeria and Ghana, usually come as stowaways or obtain a Brazilian visa and reach Argentina crossing the border by land. </p>
<p>In Brazil, Africans are now the largest refugee group, making up 65 percent of all asylum seekers, according to the country&rsquo;s national committee for refugees. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Brazil received a large number of Angolans fleeing from the civil war. Now Congolese immigrants are escaping violence back home and seeking asylum in Brazil, which has the largest black population outside Africa. </p>
<p>&#8220;The adaptation process is really good,&#8221; said Carolina Montenegro of UNHCR Brazil. &#8220;For Africans it tends to be easier because of this cultural heritage.&#8221;</p>
<p>But adapting to a new life in Argentina can be hard in a country where in the last census more than 97 percent of the population describe themselves as white.</p>
<p>Abdou Secka, 30, a refugee from the Gambia, works washing cars in the outskirts of Buenos Aires. </p>
<p>During his first year he has learned Spanish and met an Argentine girlfriend, but he said he often faces discrimination. </p>
<p>&#8220;Argentina is a free country,&#8221; Secka said. But, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t like how people stare at me in the street or point at me and say: &#8216;Look there goes a black man.&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>Other immigrants said they had also been discriminated against because of their skin color. But they said it was minor compared to the xenophobia African migrants face in Europe. </p>
<p>Most Argentines descend from Italian migrants. But while Italy enacted legislation that made it a felony to be an illegal immigrant or to help one, in Argentina they can get a temporary work permit while they legalize their immigration status. </p>
<p>They also get free healthcare and many take Spanish lessons taught by Catholic Church charities. </p>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it Carlos Menem who started brining in the Bolivian Amerindains that now infect Argentina, all in the name of Diversity?  And now they allow Africans to sneak in.  Why in heavens name do they wanr Buenos Aires to look like Washington, DC.  Why would they want Argentina to look like Brazil?  Are all European-derived people mentally ill?</p>

		<p>Istvan, it&rsquo;s for the same reason white people don&rsquo;t do anything about it in other countries.  This is because in Argentina no one has lived or experienced blacks so they accept it.  I tried many times to tell people down there what it&rsquo;s like and they kept calling me a racist.  It&rsquo;s a vicious cycle that can be stopped through legislation like in Italy but too many countries are far from it.</p>

		<p> Notice how the writer concentrates very heavily on telling how the Africans have been &#8220;welcomed&#8221; (by the powers that be, anyway) in Argentina, with only a few passing references to Brazil? That&rsquo;s because Brazil is already half non-White. Those who want to dilute the European cream of Argentina with a flood of African coffee are tickled to death to see the overwhelmingly White country start to darken. Notice how the writer is at great pains to mention black immigrants marrying White Argentine wives, and fathering mulatto children? His delight in the fact is all too obvious.</p>
<p> Why didn&rsquo;t he go out on the street in Argentina and ask a random sampling of Argentinians their views on Africans being admitted en masse? Because he feared getting the &#8220;wrong&#8221; answers, that&rsquo;s why.</p>

		<p>Latin American countries with few blacks would be wise to repel all boarders from Africa or those Latin American countries already afflicted with them. The behavior and performance of blacks in Brazil, Belize, Colombia, Venezuela, etc is plain for all to see.  One would hope nations such as Argentina would take strong and forceful measures to keep them out and simply ignore the inevitable caterwauling from &#8220;human rights&#8221; organizations. </p>

		<p>No one should be surprised with African immigration to Argentina. The colonial slave trade ocurred in all South American countries and Argentina is no exception. According to wikipedia, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries blacks comprised up to fifty per cent of the population in some provinces of the Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata. They are simply coming back home again&hellip;</p>

		<p>Africans will do anything to get away from other Africans and get to a safe White nation, town or neighborhood.  Africans are racial realists   &mdash;   they realize that living among Africans brings poverty, misery, and brutality.  They prefer to live among Whites.  They prefer to marry Whites.  Africans are racist.</p>

		<p>Hello, my name is James. I am a Anglo/American who married a Argentinian/Australian woman in 2001. In saying that, I have been to Argentina several times. This includes a very recent trip in 2007. Anyway, I do not believe that Argentina will ever have a large African population. I say this mainly because while Argentina does have a limited amount of social services, they pale in comparison to countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, etc. In Argentinia one must work for the most part. Black Africans can rarely compete with Europeans in the work place. That goes for blue collar as well as white collar jobs. It is no coincidence that Africans inhabit the lower echelon of society in  ALL Latin American countries with virtually zero exceptions. This is mainly due (in my opinion) to the lack of white/western social programs that are often implented in predominantly white countries to ENFORCE equal outcomes among the races. Black Africans will remain on the bottom as long as they stay in Argentina due to the genetic differences amongst the races. Argentina is not a rich nation  by any stretch of the imagination. That being said, I do not remember seeing many black Africans there at all. In fact I may have seen 2 or 3 in the time frame of 3 weeks. I think the reporter here is a little zealous.</p>

<p>Latin America is a huge place. Countries like Brazil, Venezuela, Columbia, Panama, Belize and Nicaragua all have large black/mulatto populations that Africans would probably blend into pretty easily.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been to all the countries you listed, except Colombia, and the only one that has a &#8220;large black/mulatto population&#8221; is Brazil, and the racial problems there are the same as any of the countries you mentioned.  Blacks are marginalized and every so often a politician gets in who caters to them, promising AA programs, but they never seem to materialize.</p>
<p>Blacks are integrated a bit better in Brazil than they are in the US, but make no mistake about it any integration they might have is among the lower rungs of society.  The middle class and upwards don&rsquo;t want them there.</p>
<p>The criminal blacks own the streets of Brazil at night, and a large percentage of them are orphans who often fight with the police who it is said conduct killer raids to reduce their population.  At least that is the accusations floating around.</p>
<p>But even in Cuba blacks are recognized as being mentally challenged, just as they are known to be everywhere else, including Central and South America.</p>
<p>And the above poster is 100% correct:  Blacks and Hispanics are nearly involved in open warfare in California, and split along lines of race in every single society in the US where Hispanics are in large numbers.  Black bullying against all races occurs daily in every big city in the country&hellip;and a few small ones also&hellip;..but when they try to continue their violent behavior where there are an appreciable number of Hispanics the result is fighting, rioting, and very often, murders.</p>
<p>This business of pretending all &#8220;people of color&#8221; stick together is something only the leadership of these groups use as propaganda to make it appear as if they are a larger, more neutralizing force against the white power structure which they despise.  But the feelings at street level amount to raw animosity by every race against blacks.</p>
<p>Without whites these groups would be killing each other by now in open warfare.  <br>

<p> Honestly, 3,000 African immigrants is a number so small as to be laughable. Europe has accepted hundreds of thousands and the United States has accepted millions of Africans over the last thirty years. </p>
<p>Australian Pride is correct that Latin American lacks the social services and welfare that most Africans seek. African immigrant&rsquo;s first choice will remain President Obama&rsquo;s America.<br>

		<p>To Raven and others:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The racial problems [in Brazil] are the same as any [Latin American] countries you mentioned.&rdquo; I doubt. We don&rsquo;t have the kind of &ldquo;racial problems&rdquo; experienced, for example, by the Andean countries, where the larger population of pre-Columbian descent is fighting the Spanish remnants. Nor we have the kind of leftist guerrilla warfare Colombia, Nicaragua and others have had which seems to target the ruling elites of Spanish descent. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Blacks are integrated a bit better in Brazil than they are in the US.&rdquo; False. Blacks are far better integrated in Brazil. This is because the Portuguese mixed heavily with black slaves, thus giving room to a large mulatto contingent. Moreover, the popular culture in Brazil has become hugely influenced by African culture, thus creating a positive image of Blacks in the country, notwithstanding the real fact that economically they are in the lower echelons of society. Some leftist organizations are trying to bring to us the same type of racial confrontation you have in the US, fortunately, until this moment, with very limited success. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The [Brazilian] police is said [to] conduct killer raids to reduce [black] population.&rdquo; False. Brazilian cops fight cruel and well armed drug gangs who kill at the least pretext.  These gangs have the same ethnic structure of Brazilian slums where blacks and mulattos have the greater share. Anyway the police do not conduct killer raids to reduce the black population not to mention the police itself is comprised mostly by black and mulatto officers.</p>

<p>CBS had a special on the number of killings by the police to reduce the number of black vagrants and orphans in Brazil.  It is occurring right now, but I seriously doubt you will hear the authorities admit to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blacks in general are burdened with disproportionately high rates of unemployment, illiteracy and infant mortality. And Brazil&rsquo;s poorest blacks are targets of racial stereotypes that often lead to extreme police violence against them. </p>
<p>&#8220;In a poll released last month by the Center of United Marginalized Populations, 93 percent of those surveyed in Rio de Janeiro state said they believe racism exists in Brazil, and 74 percent said there is a lot of bias.&#8221; </p>

<p>There have been numerous ebbs and flows of police death squads causing the disappearance of various and assorted street urchins and thugs from the favelas of Rio and Sao Paulo. More than a few wound up as shark chum in the South Atlantic Ocean. </p>
<p>Look for a huge uptick in this in the next two years as politicians and public security officials in Brazil have acknowledged that they have a lot of work to do in this area in preparation for the Summer Olympics. Unintended consequences of The Messiah&rsquo;s political Mecca losing the Summer Olympics??  </p>

<p>Do they not stare at white people in Gambia?  What would the reaction be, in Gambia, if a white man moved there and took a native black girlfriend?  If he is so bothered by discrimination, they why does he not move to a blacker country?  I&rsquo;ll tell you why.  It&rsquo;s because having a white girlfriend was his goal all along.  Indeed, the Argentinians are fools for letting in Africans and immigration officials have blood on their hands.</p>

<p>You use the wrong source of information regarding Brazil. CBS and Washington Post are the prototype of liberal media, correctly despised by this very AMREN. </p>
<p>The CEAP (CUMP as you quoted) lacks any credibility. CEAP is an NGO built around former juvenile criminals and funded by a myriad of leftist organizations whose real objective is to bring the South African nightmare in full to Brazil.</p>
<p>Fortunately their destructive efforts have somewhat stalled as we keep striking criminal gangs with chock battalions, armored vehicles and whatever needed. And the situation has improved a lot in São Paulo and Rio is following the same course. No paradise but improving.</p>
<p>As to racism, yes, we have racism here, as there is racism if EVERY human society. The difference here is that because of the aforementioned factors we live ourselves in much more harmony (or shall I say) much less conflict than anywhere else.</p>

		<p>RE Anon #18  &mdash;  Another interesting thing about Portuguese and sub-Saharan Africans:  The continental Portuguese had Africans (imported from Portuguese African colonies) strolling the streets of Lisbon many years before Columbus discovered Hispanola. Traces of (non via New World) Afro-Portuguese miscegenation are still visible in Portugal today.</p>

		<p>I have traveled quite a bit in Chile, Peru, and Argentina. I found Argentina to be a nice country. Blacks are rarely seen anywhere. And that is one of the pluses. It occurred to me that this could be a place for whites from N America to relocate after we finish giving away our own country to people that hate us. Good job white liberals, by the way. Thanks a lot. The handful of blacks I saw in BA were selling watches on the street. The largest immigrant population in Argentina seemed to be the indigenous peoples of Paraguay, and to a lesser extent, Peru. These two groups were more prone to crime than Argentineans of European descent  &mdash;  no surprise there  &mdash;  and the neighborhoods where they lived were the most dangerous. They also did the jobs that middle class Argentineans wouldn&rsquo;t do. Chile&rsquo;s population is almost entirely mestizo, with a large German population. Some of the indigenous Mapuches live in the South. Chile is being flooded with Peruvians and Bolivians. They come supply cheap labor and take advantage of government entitlements. They also bring with them the drug trade and violent crime. Many chilenos are not too happy about Peruvians. They call them dogs  &mdash;  &#8220;perros.&#8221; Of course, Chile has its liberals who defend them just like in the US, and that is why they stay. But for the most part, Chile and Argentina are much more conservative than N. America. Just some observations.</p>

		<p>&#8220;As to racism, yes, we have racism here, as there is racism if EVERY human society. The difference here is that because of the aforementioned factors we live ourselves in much more harmony (or shall I say) much less conflict than anywhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I was there the entire country, except for the street people who tend to unite as a persecuted group of raggedy souls, were of the opinion that they would like to get rid of the blacks.</p>
<p>Are you speaking as a part of the minority or the middle class?  The reason I ask is because there&rsquo;s an abundance of news stories also on the web detailing racial discontent in Brazil.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the only one I&rsquo;ve EVER heard who said differently.</p>

		<p> - &ldquo;Anyway the police do not conduct killer raids to reduce the black population not to mention the police itself is comprised mostly by black and mulatto officers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CBS had a special on the number of killings by the police to reduce the number of black vagrants and orphans in Brazil. It is occurring right now, but I seriously doubt you will hear the authorities admit to it.</p>
<p>Why is this surprising to anyone? Just like whites here have traitors working for the far-left (and to a certain extent, right-wing corporate extremists), the black police and lawmen of Brazil would be considered &#8220;Uncle Toms&#8221; if this were pre-Civil War America. Because they target the criminals who are overwhelmingly black. So they are going against their own people? NO. They are trying to preserve a civilized society, or what is left of one. And the majority of the criminals happen to be black. Sounds like the good old US of A doesn&rsquo;t it? </p>

&ldquo;Traces of (non via New World) [sub-Saharan] Afro-Portuguese miscegenation are still visible in Portugal today.&rdquo;<br>
It may be true although many Portuguese deny it explaining those traces as the result of Moorish [North African] blood. What is true is that the Portuguese mixed with Blacks more often than other Europeans. And for Portuguese and Brazilians the &ldquo;one drop rule&rdquo; is utter nonsense. </p>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been to all the countries you listed, except Colombia, and the only one that has a &ldquo;large black/mulatto population&rdquo; is Brazil&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess it depends on how you define &#8220;large,&#8221; but blacks and mulattoes make up roughly the same or greater percentage in those countries that they do in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the above poster is 100% correct: Blacks and Hispanics are nearly involved in open warfare in California, and split along lines of race in every single society in the US where Hispanics are in large numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those conflicts are generally with Mexicans and other mestizos. Blacks and Caribbean hispanics have high rates of intermarriage.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sick to death of blacks complaining in a foreign country. Why don&rsquo;t you live in your own country then?</p>
<p>And I also hate secret promoting of race mixing, like this sentence:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;During his first year he has learned Spanish and met an Argentine girlfriend, but he said he often faces discrimination.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Oh yeah, this is also white man&rsquo; fault! What would you do if I come to Kenya and chase after your cousins?</p>
<p>And finally, I&rsquo;m also sick to death of Western/American culture (better: mass and mainstream media) which is unfortunately becoming more and more dominant in my home country (Turkey) and transforming my people -more women than men- into racially unconscious feminazis (who blame me for being racist).</p>

&ldquo;When I was there the entire country [&hellip;] were of the opinion that they would like to get rid of the blacks.&rdquo; &hellip;&rdquo;You&rsquo;re the only one I&rsquo;ve EVER heard who said differently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am really curious about the people you talked to and the places you visited. &ldquo;Getting rid of the Blacks&rdquo; is an extreme view even in southern states where there are sizeable contingents of people from Italian and German descent. Not to mention its infeasibility in a country where Blacks and mulattos form the majority of the population.</p>
<p>Fact is the &ldquo;Brazilian way&rdquo; to treat Blacks has been patently different from the &ldquo;American way&rdquo; notwithstanding the fact that racism is present in both countries. </p>
<p>You are right in noticing the increase in racial discontent here in Brazil. They are the intended consequences of the work done by the liberal media and Black/ leftist NGOs, here and abroad, who want to bring to Brazil the kind of racial strife and &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; typical of Anglo Saxon countries.<br>
 <br>
It may be that in the end &ldquo;globalization&rdquo; will prevail and the &#8220;Brazilian way&rdquo; destroyed. This will be a calamity to Brazil.</p>
<p>By the way I&rsquo;m from Portuguese descent, upper middle class Brazilian. I am grateful to AMREN for the material posted and the space to comment. I have learned a lot. <br>

		<p>Like #25, I have also traveled in Chile, Argentina, and Peru.  In fact, I just returned to the US after a year living in Chile.  Quite an interesting country.  While classism, and to a much smaller extent racism, both exist, it pales in comparison to what we see here in the USA.  There is some resentment towards the indigenous Mapuches, who make up only about 4% of the population and yield little to no power.  The most :racism&#8221; I saw was of that against the darker Peruvians who take advantage of Chile&rsquo;s superior economy and take low wage jobs in Santiago.  Chile is an extremely interesting country and I will tell you why.  There are no Blacks.  I ran into some violent Latinos on occasion, for sure, but in about 300 days living in the country I saw about 10 Blacks, and I strolled around the city everyday.  The Chileans are so isolated due to the Andes and the Pacific coast, that their country makes for an intriguing bastion of hope.  Hopefully, the Conservative government is elected next month, and the immigration policies are tailored to avoid the flood of darks that Argentina is now combatting.  Chile is about to become the first fully-developed Latin American nation (just invited to join the OECD) and the Latinos there are very White.  I am thinking about moving back (despite the petty crime) before my homeland falls into the Third World.  Chile might be our only chance in Latin America..if they become educated about Blacks because they have no clue right now.</p>

		<p>I can vouch for this folks.</p>
<p>They are quiet, keep to themselves, but they are growing in number and their arrival corresponds with lots of forums on Race relations, which, amusingly, has many in Latin America confused.</p>
<p>Also, something no one seems to have noticed, but that I delight in pointing out, the Africans sell jewelry on the streets and they are all, to a man, better dressed than the people they are selling their trinkets to.  <br>
They stand there with Nikes on their feet, Levis on their legs (do you know how much a pair of Levis in LA costs? It isn&rsquo;t cheap) and Gap shirts, and sweatshirts and hooded jackets on their backs, depending on the weather.</p>
<p>Argentina is beginning to smell the coffee.  For a reason.<br>
They have the largest White population in SA.</p>
<p>Also, many on the Left there are begnning to see that the biggest change politically among the Communists and Socialist in the 20th century was the shift from Class (Unions, Workers, etc) to Race (AA, Special treatment, Obama).</p>
<p>Many on the Left are also resentful of the fact that they have been ordered by their elites into Complete and utter silence about Obama&rsquo;s aggression in the Middle East.<br>
When they have protested they have had the usual accusations hurled at them, which has thrown them in a panic.<br>
But mostly, they are puzzled.  Ah, life is good!</p>
<p>They were very noisy about it when Bush was there and had a huge rally in Argentina with Chavez present.<br>
But as Obama came into the picture and doubled, tripled, and quadrupled Bush&rsquo;s aggression the Left got quieter and quieter.<br>
Now, even they know this silence has made them look sheepish, hypocritical, and, stupid. But above all, useless, irrelevant.<br>
They then turn from that, with nothing to say (and we are talking about a big group of compulsive talkers folks) to the rise of blacks who don&rsquo;t seem at all capable, let alone interested, in adapting, which is something the people down in that part of the world insist on, or they just won&rsquo;t talk to you.  <br>
And THAT, the fact that they just don&rsquo;t interact* is already being used as &#8220;evidence&#8221; of racism.</p>
<p>The White left in LA is getting theirs in a big way folks.<br>
Ah, hahahaha!, or, as they might write in spanish, jajajaja! <br>
Is this an indication of things to come?<br>
Will this become endemic, and epidemic, among the White Left in the rest of the world?<br>
Of course!</p>

		<p>And THAT, the fact that they just don&rsquo;t interact* is already being used as &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; of racism.</p>
<p>*That they don&rsquo;t interact in LA is far more cultural than racial.<br>
That I can attest to. They would do it to other Whites who are outsiders, and the Indian population in Argentina, Jujuy and Salta for example, do it to the Bolivian Indians.  It&rsquo;s cultural and territorial, not racial. That the Africans insist it is racial is only succeeding in raising suspicions, and increasing resentment. </p>
<p>For years and years many Whites in Latin American sided with blacks as some kind of political solidarity.<br>
That was before blacks had any power.  Now,they have more than enough and the White Left is quickly becoming irrelevant, and not just in LA.</p>
<p>But, I can tell you for a fact that they are not ignoring them in LA because they are black.  They would have love nothing more than to unite with them against the group they have been told for one hundred years is &#8220;Satan&#8221;, ie; The USA.<br>
But that narrative is being stripped away from these Lefties, and fast (in part fuelled by the USA&rsquo;s considerable loss of influence and power). <br>
It&rsquo;s kind of chilling to see.  They are pretty much standing around like dear caught in the headlights.  There&rsquo;s nothing for them to say or do. <br>
Actually, plenty, but they can&rsquo;t say it or do anything.  And people like Lula from Brazil&rsquo;s comments blaming &#8220;Whites&#8221; a couple of months ago is putting what has become a chill into a deep freeze.  It&rsquo;s kind of spooky in a way.</p>
<p>Oh, and another thing, the most important thing I would like to add about the Africans, in relation to their clothes, is this.<br>
They come to countries where the native born population is barely solvent, and they come better dressed than the people they sell things to, things the people don&rsquo;t need and don&rsquo;t want, and the press pays attention to their whining WHILE continuing its routine of completely ignoring their own people!</p>
<p>And yet, they expect from these people mercy and compassion for blacks, who are better dressed and get more attention (despite the fact that they in no way contribute) from the press.<br>
Conclusion?<br>
They are being sponsored by someone.<br>
They have been sent there.  I don&rsquo;t care what the press says (like we should trust them on the matter, or any matter).<br>
No folks, the Africans are being funded. <br>
Has to be, no doubt. <br>
They come from poor countries and arrive better dressed to sell things the locals hardly need and can scarcely afford, to add insult to injury, they receive automatic, and fawning media attention.  Come on!!!!<br>
