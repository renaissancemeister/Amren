<h1>Why I Hate the Hook-Up</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alfred Edmond Jr., Black Enterprise, December 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Stop me if you&rsquo;ve heard this one. Richard, a black comedian calls his white friend: &#8220;Hey, Chad. Just wanted to let you know: I&rsquo;ll be in town next week to do a show. Hope you can make it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chad: &#8220;Really? That&rsquo;s great! What night is it? I&rsquo;ll call all of my friends and we&rsquo;ll pack the house! It&rsquo;ll be a blast!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, Chad!,&#8221; says Richard. &#8220;It&rsquo;s on Thursday night. I&rsquo;ll see you then!&#8221;</p>
<p>Richard hangs up, excited about the prospect of a big night at the comedy club, which means more gigs. He then he calls his boy, Lamont. (What? You know he&rsquo;s black. How many white, Asian or Latino guys named Lamont do you know? Try to keep up, okay? Anyway .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. )</p>
<p>Richard: &#8220;Monty-Mont! Whassup? It&rsquo;s ya boy, Richy-Rich! Just hollerin&rsquo; atcha to let you know that I got a gig in town next Thursday. You coming, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lamont: &#8220;Hell, yes, I&rsquo;m coming! You funny as a mug! Shoot, I&rsquo;ll bring my girl, and tell her to bring her girls, and I&rsquo;ll get Antonio and Big Rob and Lisa to come and get the word out to their peeps, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool!,&#8221; says Richard. He holds his breath. He knows it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;You gonna hook us all up, right?,&#8221; says Lamont.</p>
<p>One of the biggest drags on black entrepreneurial growth and profitability is the &#8220;hook-up&#8221;: black people expecting other black people to provide them with free goods and services just because they&rsquo;re black. We need to stop it. Today. NOW.</p>
<p>No, she can&rsquo;t hook you up with a few press releases and some public relations for your event.</p>
<p>No, he can&rsquo;t hook you up with a few signed copies of his book.</p>
<p>No, he can&rsquo;t hook you up with a quick shape-up so you can look fly at the club tonight.</p>
<p>No, she can&rsquo;t hook you and your momma and aunties up with free tickets to the fashion show.</p>
<p>No, she can&rsquo;t hook up a business plan for you real quick.</p>
<p>No, she can&rsquo;t deliver the dinner keynote without an honorarium, in return for two tickets at the head table for food she won&rsquo;t get to eat. Because she&rsquo;ll be speaking during the dinner.</p>
<p>No, they can&rsquo;t wash your car, pull your teeth, do your hair, fix your computer, edit your manuscript, paint your house, build your web site, etc. for free! Discount? Maybe. Complimentary services for referring new  &mdash;  paying  &mdash;  customers? Okay. An occasional freebie for long-time, loyal customers who always pay? Sure. Barter my goods or services for yours? We might be able to work something out. But, FREE? NO!</p>
<p>Hello? The point of being in business is to make money! How can entrepreneurs, and black business owners in particular, make money, if they&rsquo;re expected to give their products and services  &mdash;  which costs them money to create, develop, market and deliver  &mdash;  away for free? If you don&rsquo;t spend money with them, they can&rsquo;t spend their money with you. If you won&rsquo;t pay for your haircut, your barber can&rsquo;t pay to eat at your restaurant. If Leslie the auto dealer won&rsquo;t pay a competitive rate for wedding planning, Lisa the wedding planner can&rsquo;t afford to buy a car from Leslie. Money has to circulate in order for economic empowerment to happen and for black entrepreneurs to have a chance to compete and thrive. You don&rsquo;t support black entrepreneurs by showing up for the hook-up. You support black business by paying up.</p>
<p>When I find a black entrepreneur or professional who provides goods and services I like, I pay for those goods and services  &mdash;  period. I know that there are costs associated with providing a service and making a product, a cost they can only recoup by selling at a profit. I don&rsquo;t want them to hook me up with free stuff. I want to hook them up with my spending, because then they can really hook me up, by creating jobs, growing the local tax base, supporting community organizations, doing business with other black entrepreneurs and professionals  &mdash;  or just having enough money and a predisposition to reciprocate, to buy goods and services (like subscriptions to Black Enterprise) from me and mine. I want black enterpreneurs to make money. I want them to succeed. I want them to get more than rich. I want to see as many wealthy black entrepreneurs, families and communities as possible. So if I like what they&rsquo;re selling, I&rsquo;m more than happy  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m thrilled  &mdash;  to pay for it, and to tell all of my family, friends and associates how great they are.</p>
<p>Do you really want to support black entrepreneurs and black professionals? Stop hitting them up for freebies. If you believe in their products and services, pay for them, as you would for the products and services of any other business. If what they&rsquo;re selling doesn&rsquo;t merit that, why are you patronizing them in the first place? Do you really think you&rsquo;re doing them  &mdash;  or yourself  &mdash;  a favor?<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s as if Black Americans resent being shaken down by people who feel they are &#8220;owed&#8221; as much as White Americans!  What are the odds this will lead to a cultural shift in the entitlement mentality that is so pervasive in Black America?  I&rsquo;d say slim.  I&rsquo;d also wager the semi-successful Black Americans griping about the &#8220;hook up&#8221; mentality are themselves latched onto the government teat to some degree themselves.  <br>

		<p>&#8220;Complimentary services for referring new customers. Okay.&#8221;<br>
 This goes against the first and best advice I ever got on the business of making custom tile or providing anything else for that matter. A carpenter once told me that you would and should always get paid once! For the job at hand. Any promise for free work in exchange for bringing in future revenues was spotty at best and at worst would just bring yet another dead-beat promising to bring in future revenues in exchange for free services now&hellip; </p>

<p>Letter to the Editor of Black Enterprise magazine:</p>
<p>What do Lamont have to say about all dis here!</p>
<p>Dis here be a lot of greedy nonsense from a Tomming brotha, what thinks he is Donald Trump. What kind of planet is he be living on? The fact of the matter be that the federal gummit needs to be paying black folks to has their teeth pulled and fixin up dey house, particularly to correct property damages what follows spontaneous expressions of self-determination. I suppose dis here old Tom calls such civil rights demonstrations &ldquo;riots&rdquo; just like whitey always be doing. He be so out of touch with the reality of the commoonity because he be livin large and forgettin his roots. I like to think that were he bein real, he would know that it be a brotha&rsquo;s duty to be looking for a way to focus on helping his fellow African Americans by giving dey whats be less fortunate den he a helping hand. </p>
<p>Old Mr. stuck-up and highfalutin Alfred Edmond Jr., I thinks you needs to be having five right across your lips, just like my father used to say to my crazy old Aunt Ester.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lamont G. Sanford, President and CEO of Sanford and Son Refuse Recycling and Antiques Emporium Inc.<br>

		<p>It is really worse than what this writer says. </p>
<p>I once had to interface with a black business group and was talking with a savvy and together black business woman who unloaded on me in this way:</p>
<p>First, to blacks, the white man&rsquo;s ice is always colder. Blacks will always prefer to patronize a white owned business. </p>
<p>Second, and even worse, and even worse than the article points out, blacks actively exploit legitimate black business. It happens this way: a well meaning black opens a business. Blacks come in as customers (sort of) and whine about needing credit because &#8220;times are hard&#8221;. If the credit is extended, the black business person can be sure that their &#8220;customer&#8221; will be somewhere else for their next purchase, most likely at Whitey&rsquo;s store, and paying cash. (Of course, the local Al Sharptons will later call out the white merchant for exploiting the locals.)</p>

		<p>Related to this, I have noticed that Kwanzaa has died down as an obsession among blacks since the beginning of the decade.  This article, and something I overheard two black women telling each other, might well explain it.  One said to the other, evidently upset at the quantity, quality and/or dollar value of their Christmas presents:  &#8220;This was a bad Christmas.  We didn&rsquo;t hardly get nuttin&rsquo; good.  Next year, we&rsquo;re switching to Kwanzaa.  Since it&rsquo;s got more days, maybe we&rsquo;ll get more gifts.&#8221;</p>
<p>And since blacks aren&rsquo;t getting 8 times as many gifts, that&rsquo;s why I think they&rsquo;re dropping Kwanzaa.  There&rsquo;s nothing in it for them, at least not like they thought.</p>

		<p>I have to admit, I&rsquo;m very much on the other side of this issue.  Although you should never allow exploitative freeloaders to take advantage, you should be generous and give of what you have and what you are, and what you do, to your friends and, especially, your family, for free.  Do without if you have to.</p>
<p>Also, give to people in need.  The poor, the sick, the lonely, the hurting.  Take care of others.  Be generous.  Usually, the is the most true, direct, and reliable path to wealth.<br>

		<p>I have an Asian friend and I asked with great ignorance but sincere curiosity, &#8220;why do Asian people fight to pay the bill at a restaurant?&#8221;</p>
<p>My friend replied<br>
Asians have a different view towards money.<br>
It is a privilege to pay because that means life is treating you well and you have surplus money. It&rsquo;s also a way to keep up appearances aka &#8220;save face&#8221; because seriously do you want people to think you&rsquo;re poor and have NO money? If there is a large group and people are not close friends then the bill gets split evenly.<br>
Insisting that the bill gets calculated based on who ate what and how much. considered &#8220;losing face&#8221;.</p>
<p>hmmm&hellip;<br>
Could it be that Asian people are onto something eh?<br>
Well Asians are the 2nd most financially success group, behind Jews. </p>

		<p>This is the funniest part about the black love of government services.  <i>It would be a step up if blacks really understood that the government gets its money from white taxpayers, and just didn&rsquo;t care</i>.  The reality is, they don&rsquo;t seem to understand even that much (g**gle Cargo Cult).</p>

		<p>Tim McHugh is correct hands down.  Any freebie is a gift from a generous person.  A gift can be refused if it is too extravagant and leaves the recipient feeling uncomfortable. I am sure that I am not the only one who has refused to accept or wished to return something that I did not think the giver could afford to give away.  That is always awkward.  It is also okay to negotiate with someone who wants to get or keep your business because that person still gets to make money while you both get to save face.  What is not okay is to demand free stuff from someone.  They then make no money and don&rsquo;t even get to feel good about what they did for you.     </p>

		<p>Sure, you should pay for professional services obtained on a strictly business-like basis.  But if (as in the story) your friend calls you up and virtually INVITES you to attend his function, putting you on the spot where you can hardly say no, then it&rsquo;s reasonable for you to expect a free ticket. </p>
<p>Otherwise, he can wait for me to read the advertisement in the newspaper, and I&rsquo;ll buy the ticket (if I feel like it) through an agency. Don&rsquo;t pin me in a spot where I can&rsquo;t refuse!  After all, business is business; but friendship is friendship. Once again blacks just can&rsquo;t see the fine line between them.</p>

		<p>I had to work in a convenience store for a brief time once, and the entitlement mentality of blacks is simply impossible to comprehend.  We didn&rsquo;t have a &#8220;change&#8221; bucket on the counter, so if anyone was &#8220;short&#8221; I simply told them to come back when they had enough money to buy their &#8220;blacks,&#8221; &#8220;rillos,&#8221; and &#8220;pinbottle buds.&#8221;  The reaction was beyond belief for me.  Sure, white folks would get angry with me for telling them I wouldn&rsquo;t &#8220;front&#8221; them a nickel, but they seemed to know that I was being a hardass, not denying them something they were entitled to.  With blacks, it was &#8220;whatchu care if the till come up short?  Aint yo money.&#8221;  Funny thing was, there were always plenty of pennies scattered on the floor in front of the register  &mdash;  we only swept the floors once a day  &mdash;  but they were too lazy to pick them up.  I&rsquo;d tell them to pick up three pennies off the floor, and they&rsquo;d say &#8220;naw, I aint buyin nuffin here, m**********r.&#8221;  You could card them and they&rsquo;d not have an ID, and make such a major fuss about it that you couldn&rsquo;t help but remember the individual, then come back in an hour and try to pull the same thing on you.  &#8220;I tole you Iz 21, what u need ID fo?  You dint axe that white man fo ID, you racist.&#8221;</p>

		<p>My late uncle was a regional director of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). He worked in economic development in a number of the &#8220;under developed&#8221; areas of the globe. He once was in the Bahamas and was scheduled to have a working meeting with the director (a black woman) of the Bahamian office of economic development. Instead of a working meeting at the director&rsquo;s office, the woman insisted that they meet over lunch at the most expensive restaurant in Nassau. After a couple of hours of lavish dining complete with champagne, the woman thanked my father-in-law and quickly left. He was stuck with a huge check. He was personally out several hundred dollars since his expense account would not cover such things. But the value of the lesson he learned was much higher. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m reading a book, published in 1970, about ghetto life.  Interviewees told researchers that they refrained from telling family and friends too much about their business because of the potential for back-stabbing and manipulation.  If you told someone you have a good man/woman, the move would be on to steal him/her from you.  If you came into money, someone who want to borrow it and, if loaned, would never repay it.  Everyone was out to get all he could for himself, and close family was the worst.  It&rsquo;s little wonder blacks trust non-blacks to treat them better.</p>

		<p>ChoctawSlimL: Interesting story, but I&rsquo;m quite curious as to how the man went from being your &#8220;late uncle&#8221; to your &#8220;father-in-law&#8221;? Did you marry one of your cousins?</p>

		<p>I can think of a close analogy to this.  Anyone who&rsquo;s worked around blacks will know how addicted they are to taking up collections for every conceivable occasion. There&rsquo;s not a relative or an excuse that does not merit a collection for something. There&rsquo;s always somebody dying, or getting married, or being sick, or having a baby, or out of work, or going to college,  and so on. These constant collections for people you don&rsquo;t even know get tiresome, but there&rsquo;s a kind of community share-the-wealth attitude, and you&rsquo;re expected to contribute or else.</p>

		<p>He was only one of the two. I was trying be deceptive to prevent any relative from seeing the post and guessing who I might be. The story is true. I won&rsquo;t say in which decade it occurred either, but let&rsquo;s say it might have been the in the late 80&rsquo;s, 90&rsquo;s or even more recently. Since the UNDP post assignments lasted only a few years at a time, I&rsquo;m sure this woman or her successors pulled (or tried to pull)the same scam on others. However, my uncle or father-in-law probably warned others at the &#8220;home office&#8221;.</p>
<p>Also among UNDP personnel, the Caribbean was considered one of the world&rsquo;s &#8220;armpits.&#8221; I know, I know, the Bahamas are in the Atlantic, but they were considered to be in the area.</p>
