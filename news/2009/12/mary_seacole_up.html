<h1>Mary Seacole Update</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rod Liddle, Spectator (London), December 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Shocking news  &mdash;  a big concert to raise money for the Mary Seacole Statue Appeal last week was cancelled at short notice, no reason given. I&rsquo;ve tried to find out why from the Mary Seacole cheerleader-in-chief, Mrs Elizabeth Anionwu, but have not heard back from her yet. But still, on the positive side, a &#8220;miniature locomotive&#8221; in Reading was recently named after Ms Seacole, and an infants school in Hackney have performed a musical celebration of her life. There has been an official wreath laying at her grave, the opening of a new Mary Seacole extension to a school, Coutts Bank  &mdash;  the bank of choice for all African-Caribbean people  &mdash;  has held a display of pictures of Mary Seacole and a new photograph of Mary Seacole has been unveiled at a museum.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an extremely good piece about Mary Seacole by a chap called Tony Sewell in The Voice. Mr Sewell confesses that he is utterly mystified at the championing of this lady who helped out during the Crimean War. He says:</p>
<p>&#8220;I find our desperation to win the arm wrestle with Florence Nightingale a sad case of &#8216;black histrionics&rsquo;. We want black heroes and heroines at any cost. We read what we want in Mary Seacole&rsquo;s life and carefully miss some key facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among those key facts, according to Sewell, was that she did not have much time for &#8220;niggers&#8221;, took no notice of the issues of racial equality and was a sort of &#8220;Katie Price&#8221; of her age. It would be better, he says, to erect a statue to a bunch of black Peckham schoolkids who pass their GCSEs. Needless to say, Sewell is taking a bit of a battering for this on The Voice website, but he could not have summed up the case more eloquently  &mdash;  especially the last point. And I don&rsquo;t suppose I am helping his case much by agreeing with him. But my argument is the same as Sewell&rsquo;s  &mdash;  the championing of Mary Seacole is stupid, patronizing and knee-jerk political correctness which actually, in the end, devalues the contribution of black people to this nation&rsquo;s history. Seacole has become British History&rsquo;s token black; she is the modern equivalent of the situation comedy Love Thy Neighbour.</p>
<p>It is not her fault, of course, but Seacole&rsquo;s position in the curriculum is misleading to schoolkids  &mdash;  who now view her as the key figure from the nineteenth century  &mdash;  and insulting to both whitey and darkie.</p>

								<h2>Why Mary Seacole Is Not a Black Hero</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Tony Sewell, The Voice (London), December 7, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>THERE IS much fanfare and noise about Mary Seacole, with a tribute concert to raise money for a memorial statue. But the reality is that Mary Seacole was the Katie Price of her day  &mdash;  an avid self-publicist who wanted fame but had little interest in racial politics.</p>
<p>I find our desperation to win the arm wrestle with Florence Nightingale a sad case of &#8216;black histrionics&rsquo;. We want black heroes and heroines at any cost. We read what we want in Mary Seacole&rsquo;s life and carefully miss some key facts.</p>
<p>In her biography on the Crimean War nurse, author Jane Robinson says of Mary Seacole&rsquo;s autobiography Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands:</p>
<p>&#8220;What disturbs many modern readers most about the book is Mary&rsquo;s refusal to identify more fully with her African heritage&hellip; she chose to ignore her black ancestry, even going so far on several occasions as to share in print British and American society&rsquo;s pervasive prejudice towards &#8216;ni***rs&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, there we have it, the most popular black hero in the UK would refer to her darker people as &#8216;ni***rs&rsquo;. And she wasn&rsquo;t doing it like some rap star hailing his bredrin. Here was a light-skinned woman who would never want to socialise with the black masses. An attitude that still continues in modern Jamaica.</p>
<p>The irony about Mary Seacole was that she managed to transcend race. In her autobiography, she writes: &#8216;I shall make no excuse to my readers for giving them a pretty full history of my struggles to become a Crimean heroine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some will argue that she was a child of her time, who spoke in the context of Britain in a Victorian age. That said it is not Mary who should be blamed but her followers, who are determined to give her a black makeover.</p>
<p>How did the debate to make Seacole a black hero ever begin? I can imagine some black nationalist sitting down wanting to play a game of black and white chess. &#8216;So&rsquo;, he says, &#8216;they&rsquo;ve got Florence Nightingale, we will checkmate the Babylon conspirators with Mary Seacole&rsquo;. The nurse who never thought to go to Africa and help take care of the Zulu warriors with their war against the British  &mdash;  instead Seacole went where she could get the highest profile.</p>
<p>No one can deny that Mary Seacole was a great adventurer and a woman who went against the grain of her time. But, I believe she would be alarmed at being remembered as a black icon. In her sub-conscious she was better than the real black masses. She would probably say &#8216;Put me on the front page of Hello magazine as the greatest nurse that ever lived, but don&rsquo;t build me a statue that links me to being a black heroine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I live half of my life in Jamaica and I quickly realised that Mary Seacole comes from a particular Creole tradition that basically had more privileges than the black folks who cut the cane. There was no way that a black woman who looked like Michelle Obama would be able to go on adventures across the globe in the early nineteenth century.</p>
<p>In many ways this kind of privilege has influenced modern Jamaica, where race is not mentioned but the ideal of &#8216;brown girl in the ring&rsquo; remains. This is not to say that those who are Creole have not fought hard for the liberation of black people. However, there is no evidence that Mary Seacole had any sympathy for the plight of the black masses, who were suffering just as badly as any white soldier in the Crimean War.</p>
<p>Instead, let&rsquo;s raise some money for a statue of a group of black boys from Peckham who have done well in their GCSE exams: now that would be a fitting memorial.<br>

		<p>This article smacks of historical revisionism in the attempts of blacks to create black heroes where non existed before. Let&rsquo;s face it history isn&rsquo;t chock-full of black heroes or black heroic deeds in the Byronic sense of heroism.</p>
<p>Blacks may have cause to celebrate a black that holds down a job, pays his way, and sticks around long enough to raise a family. Whites do not see this as heroic, but commonplace, and the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Mary Seacole did good things. She used her knowledge of medicines and herbal remedies in the service of her country. She wasn&rsquo;t a saint, and from all accounts, was a flagrant self-promoter. You find many blacks or mixed race people from the British Empire who performed one service to whites and have subsequently been lauded and immortalized for the deed. For example, In Vancouver, BC where I live, we have Joe Fortes. He was a mixed race, West Indian itinerant sailor who wound up in Vancouver. He was a bartender, professional tough, perhaps a pimp, who lived in a shack on the beach. His one service, his one good deed was to teach generations of Vancouver children how to swim. For this he has a monument erected in his honour, and a restaurant named for him. Very similar to the Seacole phenomenon.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We want black heroes and heroines at any cost.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, just make some stuff up then!</p>
<p>Wellington was noted for his dark features, hair, eyes, etc. You know. </p>
<p>Nelson had an ancestor who was referred to as &#8220;Blackie&#8221;. You know.</p>
<p>The Baron of Notting Hill had an exceptional interest in all things African and even from time to time dressed in a loincloth. You know.</p>
<p>A famous Scotsman from way back when was known as the &#8220;Black Douglas&#8221;. You know.</p>
<p>Sure, why not?</p>

		<p>White buffoons are so desparate to find black &#8220;heroes&#8221; that it doesn&rsquo;t matter to them how meager their accomplishments were. As &#8220;Richard&#8221; noted, the Canucks have built a monument to, and named a library and restaurant after, a black man named Joe Fortes who worked as a swimming instructor!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that Fortes, Mary Seacole, Rosa Parks etc. were bad individuals, just wildly overrated.</p>

<p>  This &#8220;attitude&#8221; continues in most of the Caribbean. In counties like Haiti and Jamaica it is the light skinned mulatto elite that occupy most of the important positions in business and industry. I&rsquo;m afraid the old liberal dream of the elimination of racism through miscegenation just doesn&rsquo;t work in the real world. <br>

		<p>Inventing black heroics and great accomplishments is hardly unique to our brethren in the UK.</p>
<p>Our own Martin Luther King was a plagiarizer and  philanderer, George Washington Carver an eccentric peanut-obsessed experimenter with few if any lasting accomplishments to his credit, and Barack Obama, a glib but superficial Marxist hack, is hardly the brilliant and far-thinking seer his worshippers would have us believe he in.</p>
<p>Interestingly, those blacks of real and notable accomplishment, such as the contempory Drs. Sowell and Williams, tend to go unrecognized by their racial kinsmen because they address the needs of humanity as a whole rather than claiming to be spokesmen for the black race. </p>

		<p>Regarding Vancouver and Joe Fortas, I recall another black personage who&rsquo;s memorialized there: Harry Jerome, a runner. There is a famous statue of him in Stanley Park. <br>

		<p>I used to have some  ridiculous  arguments about the Mary Seacole and the &#8216;blackness &rsquo; thing. Frankly, if Seacole was black, then fair play, give her dues. But to my mind she was a quadroon; three quarters white and one (&#8216;drop&rsquo;)quarter black. <br>
I&rsquo;ve also come across  few people in my time, who as it turns out, were the same &#8216;one drops,&rsquo; but never saw themselves as anything but  white. Indeed, some of the most vehement deniers I&rsquo;ve ever known have been some sort of mullato breed.    </p>

		<p>She was the daughter of a Scottish naval officer, and the story said she was probably an octroon. </p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s the best they can come up with?  A &#8220;black hero&#8221; who&rsquo;s actually 7/8th white?  How embarassing for them!</p>

		<p>The desperation to create black heroes unfortunately does not stop with the elevation of nonentities like Mary Seacole. There are streets and public buildings in London named after people who came fifth in the olympics,or after convicted drug cheats such as Linford Christie.An even more disturbing trend of late has been the obligatory airbrushing in of black and asian characters and extras into period dramas,most notoriously in The Tudors and Little Dorrit. Not content with this though, the BBC has recently taken it upon itself to re-write the history of the second world war by exagerrating the role played by black West Indians,who volunteer in their droves to save the mother country(which magically seems to have already been enriched by immigration) from the Luftwaffe in a disgraceful piece of nonsense called &#8216;Small Island&rsquo;.The lies just get bigger and bigger. </p>

<p>And as a Jamaican and British heroine, too.</p>
