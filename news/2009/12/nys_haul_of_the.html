<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Pickled cobra that &#8220;cures&#8221; kidney problems. Chinese Viagra made with deer penis. Balms filled with powdered tiger bone. Bushels of bushmeat.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the exotic and unlawful imports that pour into New York City daily.</p>
<p>And when the black-market booty is not seized by federal agents at airports, they can be found on the shelves of China town apothecaries, Bronx botanicas or swap meets in ethnic neighborhoods throughout the city.</p>
<p>Last week, feds arrested Simon Chaw for stuffing 16 live Asian Bonytongue fish into his suitcase, which he brought on a flight from Malaysia. He&rsquo;d packed the fish in bags of water and protected them with Styrofoam.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Post interpreter was told recently in Chinatown that he could buy bear gall bladder to clean his blood, and deer penis to improve his sexual prowess.</p>
<p>Inspectors say many strange objects are used in so-called traditional Chinese medicines  &mdash;  thought to cure everything from a toothache to cancer.</p>
<p>Onda said the Chinese use &#8220;medicine mules&#8221; like other cultures use &#8220;drug mules&#8221;  &mdash;  smuggling into the country thousands of hidden pills containing ground-up tiger and leopard bone.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This month, a Liberian-born Staten Island woman, Mamie Manneh, was sentenced to three years probation for smuggling 65 pieces of African bushmeat from illegally poached wild animals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, inspectors are constantly surprised by the strange imports they encounter  &mdash;  such as the cobra pickled in rice wine that was found on a recent flight from Thailand to JFK.</p>

		<p>What scares me is how people behave. I live in California, and welfare, school lunch programs, and medical services are crushing our state budget. If you&rsquo;re able to support yourself and your family I don&rsquo;t care if you eat nothing but rattlesnake livers and pigs brains. The problem is so many new comers arrive knowing how to expertly work our system.</p>

		<p>There is a mini-china town near me.  About six or eight blocks filled with asian stores.  When I pass by there, some of the odd, unidentifiable things that are displayed in trays in front of the store are rally off the charts.  I mean, what kinds of nasty little things do these people eat?  The dried and pickled things are the worst.  Dried seahorse or pickled pigs ears anyone?  It&rsquo;s like &#8216;soul food&rsquo; but with infinite varieties of grossness.</p>

		<p>Of course, the hideous tortures to which these animals were subjected, is something Ms. Cohen choosed not to discuss. From what I have learned by reading and discussions with Asians, it is often far more painful than anything Michael Vick did to his dogs.</p>

		<p>New Zealand has a flourishing deer industry. Some are reared in captivity and some are shot in the wild.</p>
<p>Many of the deer carcasses are chilled and air-freighted to Europe, most of the skins are processed locally and various parts - the genitalia included - go to East Asia for use in the sort of rejuvenation medicine that older men are convinced will do them a great deal of good when it comes to bedroom encounters.</p>
<p>They also believe this of drinks made from snake blood, the black Irish beer called &#8216;Guinness&rsquo; and eating the flesh of dogs.</p>
<p>When I taught Chinese students in Japan I was assured that eating dog flesh is just the stuff if one has a hot date.</p>
<p>The mention of the Liberian woman and her cargo of bushmeat is odd; one of the many theories concerning how AIDS reached the U.S.A. concerns African bushmeat, specifically meat from monkey carcasses.</p>

		<p> one of the effects of mass chinese immigration will be the weakening of our exotic game laws  that protect endangered species they just don&rsquo;t care- soon msm will have articles about the &#8216;racism&rsquo; of not allowing dogs to be slaughtered for meat, or in libertarian leaning publications how we can create a &#8216;market that will protect species&rsquo; by allowing, say tigers to be farmed and slaughtered.</p>
<p><br>
white liberals will back off from their &#8216;we love animals more than (white) humans&rsquo; stance when they are accused of racism.</p>

		<p>Good &#8220;cures&#8221;? I&rsquo;d figure those human body parts in African witchcraft have more effectiveness, myself. We&rsquo;ve all heard about &#8220;modern, progressive Africa&#8221;, where people are still murdered yearly, to obtain their organs and body parts for magic rituals and potent talismans.</p>

		<p>It was also recently reported that Russia&rsquo;s population of Asiatic black bears is in deep decline because of barbaric Chinese practices. Bear parts are used in their primative medicine, and impoverished Russian poachers kill the bears and ship them to China. China is also behind the deforestation of eastern Russia. Trees in national forests are illegally chopped down and processed in Chinese-owned sawmills for shipment back into China. </p>
<p>We should also keep a close eye on our turtles, snakes, and other native species so that they are not gobbled up in savage rites. </p>
