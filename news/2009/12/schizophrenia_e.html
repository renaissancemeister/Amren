<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/dec/09/african-caribbean-schizophrenia-policy">Schizophrenia &#8216;Epidemic&rsquo; Among African Caribbeans Spurs Prevention Policy Change</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Lewin, Guardian (London), December 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Research shifts government mental health strategy to focus on ethnic minorities and controversial social issues</p>
<p>It is nothing short of an &#8220;epidemic&#8221;, say the authors of a major study that has found that members of the African Caribbean community are nine times more likely to suffer from schizophrenia than people in the white community.</p>
<p>The study has had a major influence on the thinking behind the Department of Health&rsquo;s (DH) New Horizons in Mental Health strategy document, unveiled on Monday, which has moved away from the aim of having specialist services for ethnic minorities, and towards dealing with controversial social issues that lie behind the very high rates of psychosis.</p>
<p>The worrying figures emerged from a large study carried out by psychiatrists and epidemiologists at the social psychiatry unit of the Institute of Psychiatry at the Maudsley hospital in south London. Named Aesop (Aetiology and Ethnicity in Schizophrenia and other Psychoses), the study involved 500 patients with mental health problems from various ethnic groups, comparing them with a control group of 350 healthy subjects.</p>
<p>The researchers ruled out genetic issues as the cause, and the previously held suspicions that psychiatrists were more inclined to diagnose schizophrenia when dealing with black males in particular. They concluded instead that the root causes lay in a whole range of social factors that lead to severe social isolation  &mdash;  people living alone, unemployment, and the vexed issue of separation from parents due to family breakdowns in the African Caribbean community amounting to a kind of &#8220;sensory deprivation&#8221;  &mdash;  all of which have a dramatic effect on people with a tendency towards schizoid personalities.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you get figures like this .&nbsp;.&nsbp;. you can only call it an epidemic,&#8221; says Julian Leff, emeritus professor at the Institute of Psychiatry. &#8220;We need a programme of social engineering, particularly to try to strengthen family structures in the African Caribbean community, with a view to keeping children in stable families. This may sound very difficult, and it would have to be done by African Caribbean community leaders, but it&rsquo;s feasible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Louis Appleby, the government&rsquo;s mental health tsar, describes the study as &#8220;probably the most important ever done in this field.&#8221; New Horizons, and a bigger public health and prevention publication to be announced next year, is in line with the findings of the research, says Appleby, adding: &#8220;Whereas our previous policy was mainly about reforming community care, this is more about how we can address some of the causes of mental illness, particularly in relation to ethnic minorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The issues are controversial, he admits, touching on sensitive issues such as the number of African Caribbean families with absent fathers. &#8220;But it&rsquo;s very clear,&#8221; he says. &#8220;There are genuinely very high rates [of schizophrenia], and the causes are social causes affecting people before they come into contact with mental health services. That&rsquo;s quite a step, and you won&rsquo;t find previous documents that have been so clear about these controversial issues. Instead of trying to build separate services for individual groups, it is about a service that is more personal to individuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Paul Corry, director of public affairs for mental health charity Rethink, is less sanguine. He says: &#8220;The numbers are so outrageous that you would think there would be really big, properly funded programmes driven through with zeal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DH&rsquo;s plan for delivering race equality in mental health care in 2005, which proposed the recruitment of 500 community workers to tackle social issues through 80 new community engagement projects, is still short of recruits. While Appleby says the plan has led to individual projects that &#8220;seem to have been successful&#8221;, what has been more difficult is to evaluate it in a way that shows it has had a single positive outcome, &#8220;like better mental health&#8221;.</p>
<p>Corry agrees that there &#8220;are some good ideas being followed up in a few areas by very good individuals&#8221;, but argues that on race equality in mental health services, the government has failed to provide &#8220;the joined-up national lead that we are all looking for&#8221;.<br>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s a matter of genetics.  The reason is that the researchers (read: liars) &#8220;ruled out genetics.&#8221;</p>
<p>I get the feeling that schizophrenia is way over-diagnosed among certain people.  I think what appears to be schizo in certain people (read:  Low IQ blacks) is merely a function of low IQ, and therefore a mental illness is the convenient excuse to distract people away from racial differences in IQ.</p>

		<p>from the article - &#8220;The researchers ruled out genetic issues as the cause..&#8221;</p>
<p>How did the researchers rule out genetics? Twin studies and adoption studies have suggested a high level of heritability for schizophrenia, also increased dopamine activity in the brain is consistently found in schizophrenic individuals which also points to a genetic causation. <br>
One glaring omission from this article is the linkage between drug abuse and schizophrenia. Those who do have the genetic predisposition for the disorder should not abuse mood altering drugs like alcohol or cocaine. I wonder how many of the Caribbean subjects that were looked at for this study were drug abusers. </p>

<p>Question Diversity, you&rsquo;re wrong. Schizophrenia is a mental illness in which people experience hallucinations and delusions. It&rsquo;s caused by dopamine, a neurotransmitter, overreacting. All that is necessary for treating schizophrenia is to take a drug like seroquel or abilify, which works to stabalize the overreactive dopamine.</p>
<p>I have schizophrenia, and I am not unintelligent. There is no correlation between IQ and schizophrenia (it generally happens in early adulthood, which is when a person&rsquo;s brain is finished growing), although an arguement can be made that untreated schizophrenia lowers IQ.</p>
<p>I would suggest that you read about schizophrenia before jumping to false conclusions.</p>
<p>As for why black Carribeans are disproportionately affected with schizophrenia, I have no idea why, though I doubt it has anything to do with blacks being less intelligent.</p>

<p>I disagree. I&rsquo;ve worked with black schizophrenics before and their behavior is well outside the range of normal, even for blacks. And most blacks are low IQ by white standards.</p>

		<p>&#8220;They are nine times more likely than whites to suffer from schizophrenia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, they won&rsquo;t say so, but there&rsquo;s no difference between Carribean blacks and US blacks, who are just as paranoid.</p>
<p>I mean, look at what they claim every day of the year.  Whites blew up the levees in NO to kill off blacks.  Drugs/aids, etc., were introduced into black neighborhoods to eliminate blacks.  I could go on with dozens more, but they all amount to about the same kind of silliness and strongly indicate paranoid personalities.</p>
<p>So, in addition to putting up with their crime, their high rate of STD&rsquo;s, their violence and chaos, plus caring for them because they can&rsquo;t care for themselves, we now have to tolerate their widespread paranoia.</p>
<p>Add that to everything else unfavorable about them, and just having them in this country is a tremendous burden that is becoming insurmountable.</p>
<p>We MUST isolate them from us somehow.  Or at least isolate them and the silly whites who support them, which includes the do-gooder ones who give everything away we&rsquo;ve earned and are responsible for putting us and our way of life in danger at every turn.</p>
<p>Better yet, I&rsquo;m thinking the communities being set up to isolate themselves from all but like-minded people might be the best way to go, because most all low class whites are almost as bad as blacks.</p>

		<p>Wait, let me guess. Another study will be done and discover that asians have a lower rate of schizophrenia than whites. </p>
<p>(And likewise, we need some studies done on race vs. psychopathic personality disorder. Use the search bar in the upper right and read the articles here on amren about it if you&rsquo;re not familiar with it.)</p>
<p>There is going to be quite a dilemma in coming years. Do we fund research into which genes cause (or strongly correlate with) undesireable personality traits, thus helping with cures? Or, do we stick our heads in the sand, and refuse to even consider the question, because it will reveal things that hurt people&rsquo;s feelings. </p>

		<p>All these big college educated &#8220;researchers&#8221; are just NOW realizing what the rest of us have known for most of our lives. Although I personally think it&rsquo;s much higher than 9%.  I imagine that this study probably cost several million and took several years to come to this conclusion. What&rsquo;s their next big project - do black men prefer White women!</p>

		<p>I think what might be actually happening here is that black males with low IQ&rsquo;s and psychopathic personalities are being classified as schizophrenic or the more nebulous &#8220;schizoid personality&#8221; by white doctors who can&rsquo;t make sense of the blacks&rsquo; impulsive, short sighted behavior.   </p>

		<p>Some researchers believe schizophrenia may be linked to low vitamin D levels especially during gestation and infancy.  Rickets, another vitamin D deficiency disease, is far more common among black children than white in the US.  Somalian immigrant children have much higher rates of autism in Minneapolis and Sweden than they do in Somalia - again possibly due to Vitamin D deficiency.</p>
<p>The obvious question is do blacks in the tropics suffer from schizophrenia at lower rates than blacks in the north?  And would this be due to the cultural or to the physical environment?</p>

		<p>When a Muslim in the west suffers an attack of the sudden jihad syndrome and runs down random pedestrians and starts shooting up synagogues, the defense is usually &#8220;mental problems&#8221;. When a black starts on a murderous rampage, a genetic trait that in the past led to chiefdom, schizophrenia is very often the defense. Imagine for one minute the sentences if the defense had to say to the judge that their client killed because he is a killer.</p>

<p>What I meant was that behavior among certain blacks that *seems* schizophrenic, and therefore is being diagnosed that way, isn&rsquo;t truly a function of real schizophrenia.  It&rsquo;s just high testosterone low IQ blacks being themselves.  But 3 Anon and others here show that the racial difference in the disorder might be self-inflicted, i.e. weed.</p>

<p>No. This study is just the beginning. We wont do just &#8216;anything&rsquo; or nothing, we&rsquo;ll blame this, as well as all ills on white men and their white society, because, while we don&rsquo;t hurt &#8216;peoples&rsquo; feelings, we certainly do hurt white men any possible way we can, putting them in straight-jacket of sorts. The late Samuel Francis called this &#8216;anarcho-tyranny&rsquo; - The more non-whites act out and the more depraved they become, the more the authorities must crack down, on white people. </p>
<p>I seriously doubt the schizophrenia &#8216;rates&rsquo; among the races&hellip; even though it does start in the family. Well, I seriously doubt all the evidence here.  </p>

		<p>they spent millions of dollars just to determine that a lot of blacks act crazy? huh? I thought that was well known to just about any white person. I do wonder if they respond to the same medications that work on white schizophrenics. Somehow I worry that black crazyness is a altogether different thing, being classified as schizo, but in reality is just &hellip; how blacks are.</p>

		<p>I work in the mental health field and have noticed a high percentage of schizophrenia in Caribbean blacks in the northern city I work in. I am unsure if it is genetic or they are dumping their problems on us. We have generous welfare benefits. More research needs to be done.</p>

		<p>Since the study has identified black Caribbeans, as opposed to black Africans, could it be that marijuana use is contributing to the problem?  Marijuana is supposed to exacerbate schizophrenia, and many Jamaican Rastafarians smoke joints as large as cigars.  Perhaps multi-generational use of marijuana is changing the brain chemistry of African Caribbeans and making them more schizophrenic.</p>

		<p>A relative who is a psychologist says that she does not see such a high rate of schizophrenia among the blacks that are referred to her for diagnosis. She agrees that black schizophrenics are often the most deeply disturbed and low-functioning of the patients she encounters.Many blacks who are referred to her as schizophrenic are not delusional.</p>

		<p>The question of whether someone could successfully amplify some of their existing behaviours to trick a psychiatrist into classifying them as schizophrenic is one I wouldn&rsquo;t bother to guess at. It must be easier to fake anger management issues than schizophrenia, however.</p>
<p>As to getting disability payments and access to meds for resale, I would say that this is a possible side benefit for receiving any kind of mental disability diagnosis. I don&rsquo;t know to what degree this actually happens. It is certainly characteristic of blacks to milk the system for all it is worth, so I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past them.</p>

		<p>Well, a couple of the above posters hit on an interesting point that is probably true in many cases of what appears to be black paranoia:  They&rsquo;re too stupid to understand through logical analysis and reasoning that many far-fetched claims and/or theories just don&rsquo;t ring true, and it is this lack of intelligence that prompts them to believe illogical concepts and claims.</p>
<p>That would certainly explain much of why they come up with so many crazy accusations against whites.</p>
<p>It is as many have said many times:  Blacks are a curse on the white race and an almost insurmountable burden to whites.</p>
<p>If a time machine were ever perfected, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say the first thing that it would be used for is to exterminate every slave seller on the continent of Africa before they had a chance to inundate the world with slaves, and to blow up every ship intended for use in the slave trade.</p>
<p>What a much better Western Hemisphere this would be without blacks. </p>

		<p>For your info, there&rsquo;s a powerful article about immigration and its triggering of schizophrenia on schizophrenia.com&rsquo;s site under their forums. Apparently, even the second-generation Americans are more vulnerable to that disease. </p>
<p>Although hardly a race realist piece overtly, one can only assume from it that diversity does indeed cause mental illness in vulnerable groups. </p>
<p>How many of the recent psychotic shooters were immigrants, by the way? Remember that Virginia Tech, guy. </p>
<p>But, yes, from the opposing viewpoint, perhaps part of black misbevior could be caused by that very overreactivity of dopamine from having been systemically discriminated against for generations. And what does high dopamine trigger? Disinhibition, right? Some tech-savy Amrener should try topost the original. </p>
