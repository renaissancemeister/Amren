<h1>Supplies With Obama Logo Surprise School</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathon Braden, Columbia Daily Tribune (Missouri), December 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Pencils and notebooks resembling President Barack Obama&rsquo;s 2008 campaign ads have been sold in at least one Columbia school and other public schools, causing the company that distributes the materials to travel around the state yanking the supplies out of machines.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pencil Wholesale distributes supplies to six Columbia schools: Parkade Elementary, Cedar Ridge Elementary, Paxton Keeley Elementary, Mill Creek Elementary, Smithton Middle School and Hickman High School, said Linda Quinley, the district&rsquo;s chief financial officer.</p>
<p>At Mill Creek, at least one pencil and a notebook with designs similar to Obama campaign advertisements have been sold out of a supply machine. Two families have complained about the politically tinged materials.</p>
<p>Three Missouri schools have contacted Jones [Greg Jones, a sales representative with Pencil Wholesale] since the beginning of the school year asking that the materials be removed, and Mill Creek Principal Mary Sue Gibson this week said she also planned to call Pencil Wholesale.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bound three-ring notebook bears a photo of literal change  &mdash;  pennies, quarters, dimes and nickels stacked into piles. Above the photo, white text reads &#8220;CHANGE&#8221; over a navy background.</p>
<p>Below the photo, &#8220;WE CAN BELIEVE IN&#8221; sits above a logo similar to Obama&rsquo;s campaign image  &mdash;  three red stripes separated by white stripes in front of a white circle with a blue background arching over the circle.</p>
<p>The supplies were designed by the art department of Harcourt Pencil Co., based in Milroy, Ind., Jones said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jones delivers the supplies to about 800 schools. He remembers seeing the Obama-esque notebook when it was first designed, but &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t think one thing about it,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>It really should come as no surprise that the modern liberal public indoctrination system is using Obama&rsquo;s logo on school supplies as a prop to further indoctrate young children into modern liberal ideology. A bonus is Obama&rsquo;s campaign gets royalties from licensing the logo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complete conflict of interest highlighting the enormous bias modern liberal Democrats have over the education of our children and young adults.</p>

		<p>Columbia is the home of the University of Missouri.  It&rsquo;s about the only place outside St. Louis and Kansas City that votes liberal on propositions and referenda, and the only rural part of Missouri outside the heavily black Delta of southeast Missouri that votes Democrat.</p>

		<p>If these school supplies were ordered with political messages on them the involved school administrators should be summarily fired.</p>
<p>If they were supplied to the school system without specific request the company should be stricken from the list of public school vendors.</p>

		<p>Remember how he said he and his henchmen would &#8220;fundamentally change America?&#8221;  This is only ONE angle of attack - go for the kids.  Obama doesn&rsquo;t have a bunch of marxist/Communists on his staff for nothing   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re using tactics right out of old-time Russia.  Watch your backs, everybody!</p>

		<p>Imagine Jewish synagogues in 1930&rsquo;s Germany receiving pencils with the saying, &#8220;Arbeit Macht Mann Frei&#8221; (&#8220;work makes one free&rsquo;).</p>
<p>This pencil company knew what it was doing, because it would be impossible for it not to. Obama&rsquo;s theme of &#8220;Hope and Change We Can Believe In&#8221; was only plastered about 24/7/365 during the campaign.</p>
<p>Indoctrinate any way they can. What next, soda bottles and cans with Obama&rsquo;s likeness on them? Lest anyone think that&rsquo;s a stretch, remember Billy Beer?</p>

		<p>I had heard that when Reagan was at his height of popularity and Democrats could not get elected they turned their attention to the public schools.  This would explain much about the Bush II shoutdowns and silly non-debates as well as the sickening fawning over Barry Soetoro. </p>
