<h1>The Decade When the Face of Canada Changed</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Sibley, The Ottawa Citizen, December 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><i>When a Canadian is concerned about his own way of living, this concern is not racism.<br>
  &mdash;  David Lam, former lieutenant-governor of British Columbia.</i></p>
<p>&#8216;Stretching over that empty sea, aground some fifty yards out, (lay) the incredible fleet from the other side of the globe.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There were better than a hundred ships in all, each one caked with rust, unfit for the sea&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They had lined up in almost mannerly fashion &hellip; and all around, thousands of floating, white clad corpses&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A hundred ships!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. On this Easter Sunday evening, eight hundred thousand living beings, and thousands of dead ones, were making their peaceful assault on the Western World.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the opening scene in Jean Raspail&rsquo;s famous  &mdash;  some would say infamous  &mdash;  novel, <cite>The Camp of the Saints,</cite> which offers a darkly futuristic tale of Europe inundated by wave after wave of desperate Third World migrants. When it was first published in 1973, Raspail was immediately tagged a &#8220;racist,&#8221; that label used to silence anyone who speaks outside the box of political correctness.</p>
<p>The novel tells of the flight of hundreds of thousands of desperate Indians from the cesspools of Calcutta. Led by a self-styled messiah, they commandeer a fleet of boats and embark for the Mediterranean. When the armada arrives off the southern coast of France, the hordes simply come ashore and spread across the continent. Millions more follow suit. Europe&rsquo;s political and social leaders are helpless. If they try to stop the refugees, millions will die. If they don&rsquo;t stop them, European culture will be destroyed. I won&rsquo;t give away the ending; suffice to say that irrational compassion holds sway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to understand why Raspail&rsquo;s book stirred so much controversy 36 years ago. European powers had only recently abandoned their former colonies. Westerners were taught to feel guilty about their imperialist past. Intellectuals inflated themselves with self-loathing. As Susan Sontag, one of the more prominent flagellants, said in 1967: &#8220;The white race is the cancer of human history.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the last decade, however, Raspail&rsquo;s book has gained a better reputation. Journalist Lionel Shriver referred to the book as &#8220;prescient,&#8221; saying it voices &#8220;an emotion whose expression is increasingly taboo in the West, but that can grow only more virulent when suppressed: the fierce resentment felt by majority populations when that status seems threatened.&#8221;</p>
<p>This greater appreciation of Raspail&rsquo;s fable is linked, no doubt, to the tide of events. Over the last 30 years, and especially in the last decade, Western nations have found themselves playing host to increasing numbers of migrants  &mdash;  legal and illegal  &mdash;  from the Third World. The International Organization for Migration estimates that, as of 2008, there were 214 million migrants worldwide  &mdash;  about three per cent of the planet&rsquo;s population. Europe has the largest number, 70 million, or nearly 10 per cent of its population. Another 50 million are in the United States and Canada  &mdash;  43 million and seven million, respectively  &mdash;  comprising about 14 per cent of those two countries&rsquo; populations. Asia hosts 61 million, or 1.5 per cent of the population.</p>
<p>(The UN defines a long-term migrant as someone who moves to another country from their usual residence for at least a year, effectively making the host country their residence.)</p>
<p>Raspail may have been writing dystopian fiction, but reality, it seems, is catching up. In 2004, the UN Global Commission on International Migration concluded, as German journalist Klaus Brinkb√•umer writes, &#8220;migration could become the most important issue of the 21st century.&#8221;</p>
<p>For many it already is. In Africa, thousands trek the length of the continent to cross the Straits of Gibraltar into Spain. Thousands of migrants from the Middle East and Asia Minor cross the Mediterranean in rickety boats to land on the shores of Greece, Italy and southern France. Boat people from as far as Afghanistan cram onto rust buckets in hopes of making it to Australia. Thousands of Mexicans risk being shot by U.S. border guards.</p>
<p>This mass migration, arguably the greatest movement of people since Europeans came to the New World, is prompting much debate. Kevin Andrews, a former Australian immigration minister, called on Australians to have an open discussion on the country&rsquo;s burgeoning Muslim population. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said body-covering burkas are &#8220;not welcome&#8221; in France. The Swiss recently voted in a binding referendum to ban building Islamic minarets. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has announced measures to control the flow of immigrants. (Recent surveys found that 80 per cent of Britons want immigration reduced, but 70 per cent were reluctant to talk about it lest they be labeled racists.) The Netherlands has imposed some of Europe&rsquo;s most stringent requirements for would-be immigrants, and other European governments are following that example as politicians react to anti-immigration sentiment.</p>
<p>Canada has not been immune from the South&rsquo;s march North. About 260,000 immigrants come to this country each year. That doesn&rsquo;t include illegal immigrant claimants. The recent example of 76 illegal migrants, mostly Sri Lankan Tamils, who were intercepted on a rusting ship off the coast of Vancouver, is only the tip of the iceberg. Estimates of the number of illegal immigrants range between 35,000 to 120,000. Nonetheless, it is Canada&rsquo;s intake of legal migrants that is the most problematic, say observers.</p>
<p>Canada&rsquo;s immigration &#8220;flow rate&#8221; is higher than almost any other Western country, according to Stephen Gallagher, program director of the Canadian International Council in Montreal. In 2007, he says, Canada had an estimated net migration about four times that of the European Union, twice that of the U.S. and a third greater than Australia.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result,&#8221; says Gallagher, &#8220;Canada is undergoing a social and demographic evolution that is much more rapid and profound than that in other immigrant-welcoming countries.&#8221; Already, nearly half the populations of Toronto and Vancouver  &mdash;  46 per cent and 40 per cent respectively  &mdash;  were born outside Canada.</p>
<p>Such a demographic shift has undeniable consequences  &mdash;  economic, social and political  &mdash;  for the country. Yet there&rsquo;s little debate about what those consequences might be, and whether they are acceptable to the majority of Canadians.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are led to believe that Canada&rsquo;s immigration policy serves the national interest and is essential for economic growth, to fill our labour shortages, and to offset an aging and diminishing population,&#8221; says James Bissett, a former Canadian ambassador and the one-time executive director of the Canadian Immigration Service. &#8220;We are also told that most of our immigrants are selected because they possess the education, trades, skills, and training essential to meet our labour-force demands. These assertions need to be challenged because they do not bear up under examination. They have become myths, used by governments and pro-immigration advocates to justify unreasonably high immigration levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, according to a recent Globe and Mail report, the federal government intends to maintain existing immigration levels even though other countries, from Japan to Spain to Australia, &#8220;are cutting immigration targets to protect fragile labour markets and encouraging itinerant workers to leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not to deny that Canada has benefited from immigration. You only have to think of all those who arrived in the 19th century and early and mid-20th century to build the country and to fight its wars. However, according to Patrick Grady, an economic consultant with Global Economics, more recent immigrants are proving to be a drain on the national economy.</p>
<p>In particular, &#8220;recent immigrants coming to Canada from Asia, southeastern Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean are not doing as well as immigrants from Europe and the United States and are not being successfully integrated into the Canadian labour market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grady points out that the existing high level of immigration is justified by the supposed needs of the market place. If corporations don&rsquo;t get the employees they need  &mdash;  particularly low-cost employees  &mdash;  then, so the argument goes, the economy will suffer. Grady challenges that view, citing a 2006 Canadian study that found &#8220;a 10-per-cent labour-supply shift caused by immigration would result in a three- to four-per-cent reduction in wages&#8221; in both Canada and the U. S.</p>
<p>&#8220;Employers are always griping about the shortages of labour. But you never hear them saying anything about the need to raise wages to attract more workers.&#8221; In Grady&rsquo;s view, the &#8220;poor performance&#8221; of recent immigrants will only improve after &#8220;a radical reform of Canadian immigration policy that substantially reduces the number of immigrants (no more than 100,000 a year) and tightens up selection criteria sufficiently to reverse the deterioration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps the most egregious flaw in the immigration system is the family class category. The Immigration Act currently allows new immigrants to bring in not only their immediate family (spouse and kids) but also their parents and grandparents of any age. This generates what is called &#8220;chain immigration.&#8221; Naturally, all these parents and grandparents  &mdash;  20,000 in 2006, according to a report to Parliament  &mdash;  are eligible for welfare and health care even though they have made no contributions to either.</p>
<p>Why is there so little willingness on the part of other Canadians to debate the immigration issue?</p>
<p>Martin Collacott, a former Canadian ambassador and one-time director general of security services, says Canadians &#8220;are afraid they&rsquo;ll immediately be called racists by all the interest groups  &mdash;  immigration lawyers, rights activists and ethnic groups  &mdash;  that have a stake in promoting immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The question, of course, is: What has made Canadians so afraid?</p>
<p>At the core of Canada&rsquo;s immigration practices  &mdash;  the theory that sustains the practice, as it were  &mdash;  is the concept of multiculturalism. Multiculturalism, in turn, is rooted in the notion that all cultures are deserving of equal respect. As Salim Mansur, a professor of social sciences at the University of Western Ontario, puts it: &#8220;Unfortunately, the politics of Canadian multiculturalism is based on the notion that all cultures represented within an immigrant culture are more or less equal, and deserve equal respect and treatment in politics and law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Immigrant groups draw on this cultural relativism to assert their right to maintain traditions  &mdash;  gender apartheid, polygamy, religious intolerance, for example  &mdash;  even if those traditions are contrary to liberal values and, indeed, violate Canadian law.</p>
<p>It is this mindset of cultural abnegation reflected in Canada&rsquo;s multicultural policies that Mansur sees behind Canadians&rsquo; reluctance to insist on immigrants conforming to the country&rsquo;s liberal way of life. &#8220;The politics of multiculturalism discourages (if &#8216;prohibit&rsquo; is too harsh a word) the majority population from demanding assimilation of minorities originating from a variety of non-Western cultures,&#8221; say Mansur, who is also a member of the board of directors of the Center for Islamic Pluralism in Washington, D.C. &#8220;Multiculturalism promotes and requires accommodation of ethno-cultural minorities by the host society &hellip; Consequently, multiculturalism together with an open-door immigration policy looses the host society from its inherited culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is surely a puzzle of our times that liberal-minded Canadians hesitate to object to the presence of those who &#8220;hate democracy and the West.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t do nearly enough to tell people that &#8216;if you come here your primary political loyalty is to Canada,&#8221; says Martin Collacott. &#8220;If you can&rsquo;t accept the Canadian way of life, and what it means, you should go elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, why would any liberal society adopt policies and practices  &mdash;  extremist multiculturalism and open-door immigration, in this case  &mdash;  that encourage the establishment of more and more illiberal tribalist enclaves in the country?</p>
<p>Perhaps, as Jean Raspail suggests, it has something to do with the state of the Western soul. &#8220;The West has no soul left. At every level  &mdash;  nations, races, cultures, as well as individuals  &mdash;  it is always the soul that wins the decisive battles &hellip; I can hardly discern any soul in us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert Sibley is a senior writer for the Citizen. In tomorrow&rsquo;s paper, he&rsquo;ll consider how the West&rsquo;s &#8220;soul&#8221; has weakened this past decade.</p>

 There was a good post on another site that highlighted the need to see &#8220;the big picture&#8221; on Islam, not just minarets and burkas. The money quote was talking about the difference between tactical and strategic thinking. It quoted Gen. Curtis Lemay, &#8220;Tactical  is kicking over the milk bucket. Strategic  is killing the cow.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;So, why would any liberal society adopt policies and practices &mdash; extremist multiculturalism and open-door immigration, in this case &mdash; that encourage the establishment of more and more illiberal tribalist enclaves in the country?&#8221;</p>
<p>One part of the puzzle as to why the West has been brought so low is compulsory   &mdash;  - and usually government   &mdash;    &mdash;   schooling. </p>
<p>For example, a superbly-written insider-look at how American public schools can effortlesslyh produce mass cultural ignorance AND self-loathing in their captive clientele is NYU research professor Diane Ravitch&rsquo;s THE LANGUAGE POLICE: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn (2003).</p>
<p>Pertinent excerpt   &mdash;  - in this instance, on the comically elaborate &#8220;bias and sensitivity&#8221; guidelines by which textbook publishers produce books to sell them to the dim bulbs who run the government schooling monopolies:</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;The MH [McGraw-Hill] guidelines express barely concealed rage against people of European ancestry. They deride European Americans for exploiting slaves, migrant workers, and factory labor; they excoriate the land rapacity of the pioneers and mock their so-called courage in fighting Native Americans: &lsquo;Bigots and Bigotry,&rsquo; say the guidelines, referring to European Americans, &lsquo;must be identified and discussed.&rsquo; European Americans, the guidelines suggest, were uniquely responsible for bigotry and exploitation in all human history &hellip;&rdquo; (p. 44) </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s any different here in the USA.  I am 64 years old, and I don&rsquo;t care what people call me.  Racist, racialist, fascist, whatever.  I stand for what I believe, and I believe we have to stop the influx of illegal immigrants to this country, by any means necessary.  We do NOT need any more sick, uneducated, takers coming here to steal resources from our own people.  We need to go back to allowing ONLY those people who can benefit our country to come here.  The rest are going to have to take care of business at home, just as we did when we came to these shores and built these United States.</p>

<p>Allowing millions of invaders into your country and then trying to control how they dress and worship is missing the point.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the authorities are getting a little nervous about the damage they&rsquo;ve done, and will be calling for a &#8220;time out&#8221; on immigration, to allow the &#8220;new citizens&#8221; an opportunity to assimilate.  The fact is, given the birthrates of the non-Whites, we are already outnumbered.  Mass expulsions and the life confinement of the traitors who brought this on us are the  are our only real hope for the survival of Western Civilization.  No justice, no peace.  </p>

		<p>When I was young, Canada was always a by-word for &#8216;White&rsquo;, in the sense that if you had to think up your forst association with the word &#8216;Canada&rsquo; it would either be a Mountie, the cast of &#8216;Rosemarie&rsquo; or that epitome of White male ruggedness the lumberjack (in the days when they wielded hand-axes and wore plaid shirts).<br>
 Canada always evoked images of Whiteness, nay-ultrawhiteness in the sense that the Scandinavian nations did.For this reason it is hard to comprehend that the face of Canada is now that of a Dravidian Indian or a black Haitian.</p>

		<p>We need to go back to allowing ONLY White Euros into this country and all White nations. I grew up in the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s and the difference now in the USA is like night and day. Whites have become strangers in their own land that they built from scratch. I feel like an outsider in my own country and the future is something I shudder to think about. Our poor children and grandchildren, just look at what we left them to deal with. As our Founders said, this nation was built for &#8220;our progeny&#8221;. Doesn&rsquo;t anyone even know what that means any longer? Apparently not. Even the so-called &#8220;conservatives&#8221; will never admit this truth or even talk about it.</p>

<p>A pretty strongly worded article for a big-city daily, and a good one. But a couple of points I would word even more strongly and less tactfully than the author did: </p>
<p><i>This is not to deny that Canada has benefited from immigration. You only have to think of all those who arrived in the 19th century and early and mid-20th century to build the country and to fight its wars.</i> </p>
<p>You might also want to think about what <i>color</i> those earlier immigrants were. </p>
<p><i>However, according to Patrick Grady, an economic consultant with Global Economics, more recent immigrants are proving to be a drain on the national economy.</i> </p>
<p>The stats I&rsquo;ve heard is that the govt of Canada &#8220;loses money&#8221;   &mdash;   i.e. shells out more in social services than it collects in taxes   &mdash;   with <i>three out of four</i> immigrants they admit. So, yeah, a failure rate of 75% would be &#8220;a drain on the national economy&#8221; all right. (Although I&rsquo;d guess that Canada&rsquo;s miserable one-quarter success rate for immigrants is still better than what California is averaging from their Mexicans; or what Europe&rsquo;s been getting with their Muslims!)  </p>

		<p>I take issue with this statement in an otherwise fine article:</p>
<p>&hellip;Thousands of Mexicans risk being shot by U.S. border guards&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Border guards are terrified of using their guns lest they end up like Ramos and Campeon, two border guards who were sentenced, in a perversion of justice, to  &#8220;lengthy prison sentences for shooting an illegal alien drug dealer while he smuggled 750 pounds of marijuana across the border.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ramos and Campeon were sentenced to 10 and 12 year prison sentences, serving two years until Bush commuted their sentences in Jan 2009.  He did not pardon them, so felony convictions remain on their records.</p>
<p>Chris writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The U.S. Border Patrol does not shoot border crossers (unless of course they are shot at first)&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after Ramos and Campeon, border agents are fearful of firing their weapons even when automatic weapons are fired at them:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;On December 1 south of Tucson, Arizona, drug smugglers unloaded $1 million in drugs across the U.S. border and sprayed bullets at U.S. Border Patrol agents with automatic weapons. The agents did not return fire. They fear losing their jobs or ending up behind bars like agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean&hellip;&#8221;</p>

Excuse me, but what wars did Canada ever have to fight?   &mdash;  -  except wars that were OTHER PEOPLE&rsquo;s wars!</p>
