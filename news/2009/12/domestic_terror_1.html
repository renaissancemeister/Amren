			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Simpson, DC Independent Examiner, December 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Maurice Clemmons, the alleged shooter in the Sunday murder of four Lakewood, Washington police officers, was killed early this morning by a Seattle police officer.</p>
<p>The blogsite Fire Andrea Mitchell reported that a radical black Muslim group called the National Black Foot Soldiers held a protest today outside the Parkland, Washington coffee shop where the murders occurred. The protesters allegedly gathered to celebrate Clemmons as a &#8220;Crowned BOW (Black on White) Martyr,&#8221; calling his attack a &#8220;preemptive strike on terrorists .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8220;</p>
<p>The substance of this story was originally announced by a blog called the Last Crusade, which has also claimed that Clemmons converted to Islam while imprisoned in Arkansas. Gateway Pundit picked up the story as well, noting however, that Last Crusade&rsquo;s claim of Clemmons&rsquo; conversion is unsubstantiated.</p>
<p>A black militant site called &#8220;Black Male Felon&#8221; seemingly described the protest:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The Black Foot Soldiers were not protesting, except perhaps online, but they were referring to Clemmons&rsquo; attack as a protest:</p>
<p>&#8220;Seattle Black Foot Soldiers say the four people slain in a <em>daring demonstration</em> at the Steele Street Forza Coffee House in Parkland were racist terrorists who caused black citizens to live in fear. (Emphasis added.)&#8221;</p>
<p>What these groups say is that any killing of whites, including in this case Clemmons&rsquo; cold-blooded murder of officers Renninger, Owens, Griswald, and Richards, is &#8220;a legitimate protest&#8221;. Black Male Felon celebrates the killings as &#8220;Brother Maurice Clemmons&rsquo; daring stand against white police terrorism.&#8221; The theme of National Black Foot Soldiers is captured in the slogan: &#8220;When whites pay reparations there will be no more black on white crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>The vitriolic hatred on these sites is enough to turn a person&rsquo;s stomach. The bit of writing contained on these sites is essentially a collage of run-on sentences spewing foul language interspersed liberally with admonitions to kill whitey. They blatantly advocate murder and defend other recent cases of seemingly senseless black on white killings, like the four Oakland police officers killed by Lovelle Mixon, and many, many others.</p>
<p>Many who voted for Barack Obama believed his election would finally put an end to this kind of racist hatred. Indeed, he promised to work toward that end. If anything however, his election seems to have emboldened it. Jeremiah Wright should have been a warning.</p>

		<p>This is not story about a few scattered lunatics. For a real eye-opener, check out any video on youtube that covers the shootings in Washington, the comments sections are rife with blacks calling the shooter a revolutionary hero and calling it &#8220;payback&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>Is there any reason to assume that any of the sites referenced are actually sites run by blacks?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any reason to assume that. The sites remind me of the site &#8220;Ghetto Bragging Rights,&#8221; which was an obviously satirical site.</p>
<p>But the ante seems to have been upped&hellip;some kind of strange game is being played here, and I suspect it goes beyond someone erecting the sites just to arouse feeling against blacks. There are strange references to &#8220;Holocaust denial&#8221; that I can&rsquo;t quite make sense of the purpose of.</p>
<p>And what people and what money and what purpose are behind these seemingly VERY conservative &#8220;Examiner&#8221; papers that have suddenly sprung up at least in a few places in the country? At the Bart stations in SF people are being paid to hand these out (the SF version of the &#8220;Examiner&#8221;) for free to commuters as they emerge from the Bart stations. </p>
<p>The present article at least does report that no demonstrations actually took place:</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever the Black Foot Soldiers may be planning, there actually was no &#8216;rally.&rsquo; Spokesmen for both the Lakewood and Tacoma, Washington police departments said they had not heard of anything like that going on. The Pierce County Sheriff&rsquo;s office, which is handling the coffee shop shooting investigation, stated unequivocally that there was no such protest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The truth about blacks is bad enough. I really resent being manipulated in an attempt to have me also believe a lot of horse poop.</p>

		<p>Sometimes we forget how naive most whites are about black racism. This guy is shocked - shocked! - to find blacks who celebrate and advocate the murder of whites they don&rsquo;t even know. But these blacks sound like 25% of the blacks I knew in the military back in the 1980s. Blacks have only become more racist since then.</p>

		<p>I said from day one that having an African in the White House would lead other Africans to believe they are now the masters over whites, because they believe that whites chose to &#8220;elect&#8221; and African to lead them.  Since the black African intellect never evolved beyond that of the the four-leged creatures thay shared the jungle with it&rsquo;s easy to see why they think this way&hellip;    </p>

		<p>During a different day and time lynchings were designed to be so horrible that they discouraged black criminality in a way that the normal justice system did not.   Our current justice system is so weak, inconsistent and vulnerable to jury nullification that it no longer poses much of a deterrent.  In fact the domination of most of our prisons by blacks insures that the killers of whites become prison personalities who can sit around the yard bragging about killing/raping/torturing whites or capping cops all while pumping iron and planning what crimes they will commit when they get out.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m constantly e-mailing these stories to friends and acquaintances. I know some of them just delete as soon as they see my name. But I&rsquo;ve also gotten some surprising feedback. Recently one guy I know who never really showed any interest started coming back to me almost sounding like a WN. One woman I know who was fine with her daughter dating blacks expressed tepid fears (no doubt growing). The jury is still out on her.</p>
<p>My point is that the effect of story after story of this nature has been cumulative and not always visible to those that work and hope for a greater awakening. The elite left are absolutely blind to it, but their useful idiots, the more casual, are beginning to turn. Nobody knows what will happen (except the &#8220;We are doomed&#8221; crowd) but don&rsquo;t be surprised when the dam bursts. Then all the things we thought were impossible, like moratorium, mass expulsions, elimination of Affirmative Action, open MSM talk on black and hispanic crime or asian job-pilfering will suddenly be on the table. Of course when that happens we might get a full-blown race war as a reaction from the people of color. As others say they are already all on the same page in a loose sort of way (but getting tighter, as the Denver story suggests, where they were using cell phones to coordinate attacks). </p>
<p>I think most blacks in this country are going to be shocked at the reaction once all bets are off. </p>

&#8220;It is always a temptation for a rich and lazy nation,<br>

We will therefore pay you cash to go away.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>     What was that group from the sixties ? ALA- African Liberation Army ? Trying to quell these types by pandering and appeasement is like trying to eradicate fire ants by spreading sugar on their mounds . All of this is a direct result of fifty years of Hollywood and liberal media propaganda that has stoked the rage of a culture elevated from prehistoric barbarism to the modern world in just 400 years or so . &#8220;You can take the boy out of the country but you can&rsquo;t get the country out of the boy.&#8221; </p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got it right on, Anglo Saxon.  Based on actual experience, I&rsquo;ve said many times Jeremiah Wright is the norm not the exception.</p>
<p>Rev. Jesse Peterson says the same thing and admits he was deluged with anti-white hatred from other blacks in his community throughout his life, until he was constantly in a rage.</p>
<p>Whether these black sites are valid or not is immaterial, because there are so many others that we know for certain ARE black sites.</p>
<p>The momentum is building.  It will get worse.  And for those on the far right, pro-white web sites, who applauded Obama&rsquo;s election because it would make race relations worse and embolden blacks, were 100% correct.</p>
<p>The American empire&rsquo;s privileged subjects are causing the empire to crack badly.  We&rsquo;re beyond the point of no return.</p>

		<p>I agree with poster #7. I believe the underprivledged journalism site is not run by blacks at all. It does seem to be some kind of bizarre satire, or maybe some kind of agitation. Why would they have links to white supremacist sites? Why all the anti-Jew sentiment? I seriously the average black, no matter how &#8220;militant&#8221;, even knows anything about Jews. To blacks, everything is White vs. black, with white being represented as everyone who isn&rsquo;t black.</p>
<p>Very bizarre site indeed.</p>

		<p>I read alot of what is posted on these message boards. You know the quandary that black Islam extremists will face is how to handle a white population in Eastern Europe that is brought up as Muslims. The Quran states that they shall not kill other Muslim brothers for personal gain or sinful pride. Somehow, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll make exceptions. Also, the blacks who claim to want to have sex with white women and breed out whites. By doing that, they are also breeding out their own race. But that&rsquo;s why their IQs are so much lower than whites. They can&rsquo;t see it for what it is&hellip; scathing hypocrisy. </p>
