<h1>Youths See Slain Black Panther as Role Model</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chip Mitchell, WBEZ (Chicago Public Radio), December 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Today is the 40th anniversary of a Chicago police raid that killed young Black Panther leader Fred Hampton and one of his comrades, Mark Clark. Hampton and his cadre promoted socialism, created their own social programs and forged alliances with like-minded Latinos and whites. They also took up arms in what they described as self-defense against police. Four decades later, some Black Panther tactics may seem antiquated. But a new generation of African American activists is embracing Hampton as a role model. We report from our West Side bureau.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the University of Chicago, Hampton&rsquo;s widow Akua Njeri addresses a packed hall that includes students as young as ninth graders.</p>
<p>NJERI: A lot of you are familiar with the survival programs of the Black Panther Party  &mdash;  the breakfast program, the medical center, the free clothing, free shoe giveaway, free prison busing programs. And a bunch of people that didn&rsquo;t have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of  &mdash;  young people  &mdash;  were organizing these survival programs and demanding that businesses that existed in the city had a responsibility to support and contribute to these programs.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not clear how far the word about Hampton is spreading among African American youths.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>FLOYD [Danton Floyd, West Side counselor]: They always want to know about their gang leaders, like Larry Hoover and Jeff Fort. But this is a leader that they need to know about, that was just as fearless, just as intelligent, and just as dangerous as these gang leaders that they look up to but was positive and was willing to do anything he had to do for his people at the same time.</p>
<p>Floyd says the youths pay attention when he tells them about Hampton, but he wonders what comes of it.</p>
<p>FLOYD: That fire is sparked, but there&rsquo;s no consistency. There&rsquo;s no way to follow up with it. It&rsquo;s not taught in schools. Honestly, a lot of these sessions that I do, their parents need to be here as well, because their parents don&rsquo;t know a lot of this information.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Northwestern University historian Martha Biondi points to the city&rsquo;s deindustrialization. That&rsquo;s pushed unemployment among black youths to levels not seen since the Great Depression. Many have turned to the informal economy, including drug sales. Biondi says politicians have responded not with large-scale jobs programs but police crackdowns.</p>
<p>BIONDI: And it seems like, well, therefore, we should have as militant or radical leaders as we did then, in 1969. But we&rsquo;ve had years now of assaults on African American families, assaults on African American communities that have produced a great degree of disorganization, incarceration, permanent unemployment, and it&rsquo;s very hard to find the political leadership, and build political movements, out of that.</p>
<p>Few know this better than Southwest Youth Collaborative organizer Charity Tolliver, 27.</p>
<p>TOLLIVER: Our youth are put in a position where they feel that the reason that they are poor is because they didn&rsquo;t work hard enough  &mdash;  this idea that we&rsquo;ve overcome: &#8216;The slaves, Marcus Garvey, Martin Luther King, they handled all that stuff back then. And now you have no one to blame but yourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Youth Collaborative uses Hampton&rsquo;s memory to inspire people like Chris Bufford, a 22-year-old working on a campaign to improve conditions at Cook County&rsquo;s juvenile detention center, where he&rsquo;s done some time. Bufford tells how the campaign addressed a lack of access to underwear in the center. The youths delivered 200 pairs to County Board President Todd Stroger.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bufford says that&rsquo;s what Fred Hampton was all about. He says another way his group emulates the slain Black Panther is by connecting African Americans to other races.</p>
<p>BUFORD: We all need to come together because we all face the same issues. We all face poverty. We&rsquo;re all facing housing issues. We all faced with health-care issues. We might not necessarily be facing immigration like the Latinos are. But this isn&rsquo;t necessarily our home either. They&rsquo;re not trying to put us out, but they&rsquo;re more so trying to lock us up.</p>
<p>Not everyone thinks Hampton is an appropriate role model. The Fraternal Order of Police helped scuttle a Chicago alderman&rsquo;s 2006 proposal to rename a block of a West Side street after him. Officers of the union told newspapers that Hampton advocated killing cops and took advantage of the communities he claimed to be serving. {snip}</p>

		<p>What I find interesting about the whole series of events re the Panthers in Chicago 40 years ago is that Bobby Rush was caught concealing a .45.  Now, as a Congressman (!), Rush is anti-gun.  Of course, he doesn&rsquo;t want white people to defend themselves against black crime.</p>
<p>Paul Huebl has a more truthful account of what happened 40 years ago:</p>

		<p>The claims that conditions are bad in Chicago for Black people simply are not true.  I know such claims are false, because Obama, Jessie Jackson, Reverend Wright, Oprah Winfrey, and Farrakhan have each devoted 20 or more years to &#8220;community-organizing&#8221; and up-lift in the Black sections of Chicago.  Together, they have spent Billions and Billions of Dollars on their projects.  </p>
<p>To now try to say that all their effort and money spent produced no change would be an insult to African-Americans.  It would imply that the money spent was wasted.  NO!  You can ask Obama, Jackson, Oprah or Farrakhan if the money they spent was well spent, and they will tell you that it was.     </p>

		<p>The death of Fred Hampton was not a murder, it was more likely due to police incompetence. Here are some fun facts omitted from NPR:</p>
<p>-Hampton had been convicted of robbing an ice cream truck.</p>
<p>-At the time Mark Clark was &#8220;murdered&#8221; by police he was firing a shotgun at them</p>
<p>-Fred Hampton Jr is a racist Marxist who was paroled in 2001 after serving nine years for firebombing two Korean grocery stores</p>

		<p>I happen to hear this drivel on WRED (my name for NPR Radio Pacifica) this morning driving to work and again the same program on driving home from work.</p>
<p>I could barely understand the black patois and the confusing ranting of the blacks, who tripped themselves up with bad grammar, mispronouncing words, getting confused on trying to remember their memorized phrases and their using 3, 4 and even 5 syllable words which they obviously did not know the meaning of.</p>
<p>Even a sophomoric Young Republican could have run circles around these semi-illiterates, as opposed to the fawning/groveling toady interviewers.</p>
<p>Even now, the former black panther, who is now a congressman, Bobby Rush, could not speak grammatically correct English.</p>
<p>The black panthers were and always will be &ldquo;much to do about nothing&#8221;. Publicity and Ford/Rockefeller Foundation money got them their fame. (My group had several run ins with them in the old days and they were not so tough.) </p>

		<p>The ice cream thief is a role model for youngsters!? Have these people forgotten who Harold Washington is? </p>
<p>At the time of the shooting, I was a confirmed leftest. At the time it was believed that the Panthers opened fired first. They thought some rival black gang was going to rob them. Bad move. They forget that political power comes from the barrel of the gun, which is not what you say when the other guy has more guns. The police at the time were not trained to handled armed thugs like this. Today&rsquo;s swat teams would have handled this better. </p>

		<p>Democracy Now! had a show praising Hampton, in which the hosts interviewed the author of a book about the Panther chairman. In condemning government infiltration of the group, the writer unwittingly told how the agent made an electric chair with which to extract truth from members and claimed to be working on a rocket that would reach city hall. Apparently, Hampton was okay with all this.  They mentioned Hampton Jr., who I discovered has a conviction for firebombing a Korean grocery.  But, if you&rsquo;re black, you&rsquo;re okay with the loony left!<br>

		<p>The greatest obstacle to reducing tension among the races is blacks.  And I&rsquo;m not including only whites when I mention &#8220;races,&#8221; because blacks engage in harassment and mob attacks against Asians and Hispanics more than they do whites, but it&rsquo;s very rarely reported beyond a local level, and like the black on Asian attacks the other day in Philadelphia, which was reported only as &#8220;racial&#8221; without mentioning blacks as the perpetrators, no one would ever know blacks were attacking Asians unless he were familiar with the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Just why these ultra leftists in the media think it&rsquo;s necessary to hide the race of black perpetrators when they commit their many mob attacks seems unfathomable, until it is understood that they&rsquo;re so lamed-brained they more than likely think race relations will clear up all by themselves if they fail to accurately report black racist attacks long enough.</p>
<p>Well, failing to report it only encourages more of the same and reinforces in the  black mind that what they&rsquo;re doing is right. The situation is going to get far worse.</p>

<p>They have reported on it over the years, but always in such a way as to make blacks out to be the true victims and white society out to be the culprit. </p>

		<p>   I want to laugh when I see all of the Pcness in the media and Hollywood . They want you to believe that the <br>
FBI,US Marshals and groups like the Panthers  were locked arm in arm, skipping merrily along fighting injustice and the &#8220;evil south .&#8221;  If you are really old enough to remember the sixties and seventies you know it is all a load of baloney . The FBI was largely indifferent to the civil rights movement in the mid sixties and by the late sixties and early seventies it had ratcheted up to an all out effort to discredit MLK, even trying to convince him to end his own life and a war of annihilation between law enforcement (including the FBI) and the Panthers . And if Arthur Bremer had not shot George Wallace, he just might have been president . If I remember correctly, in Maryland he said,&#8221; In Wisconsin we shook the eye teeth of the liberals, lets make them fall out now .&#8221; If only Bremer could have stayed out of the picture, we all might not be here lamenting the almost certain demise of our beloved America .</p>

<p>If I had known this, I would have organized a party at my house on Friday to celebrate the well deserved eradication of two black Communists. Heck, if I had the money to do it, I would have invited the policemen that shot the two comrades to be the guests of honor!</p>
<p>Seriously, it is an abject disgrace that public tax money goes to a Red broadcasting enterprise like NPR. Of what value is it, other than to entertain sane people with the most base examples of Marxist idiocy, and provide demented &ldquo;Progressive&rdquo; perverts with lurid  masturbatory material. </p>
<p>Enough said, other then, God help us all!</p>

<p>They have no interest in race relations clearing up,  they are consciously genocidal,  they suppress news that casts a negative light on multiracialism to keep their victims subdued until they enter the slaughterhouse.   This is an important point, &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; is aimed only at whites, and it isn&rsquo;t about racial harmony, it&rsquo;s the final solution to the white problem.   That&rsquo;s why the left doesn&rsquo;t care about blatant non-white racism.  </p>

<p>If you really did invite the cops involved in the fatal raid on Panther headquarters to your house it would be an interracial party.</p>
<p>You see, five of the cops involved were black, including James Davis who (drumroll, please) fired the fatal bullets into Hampton and Clark!<br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/yjt4tnp" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yjt4tnp</a></p>
<p>Needless to say NPR and the other leftists who&rsquo;ve whined about this incident for four decades always omit this detail.</p>

<p>Fine by me!</p>
<p>They still helped rid the world of a few black Communists, who got exactly what was coming to them. Interesting info about the fatal shots MG; it is totally unsurprising that NPR omits these facts. They really are a twisted joke, even for a &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media source. </p>
