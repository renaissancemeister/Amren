			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk Examiner, December 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police say that at least seven employees at the state license bureau in Delray Beach have been taking bribes to issue drivers licenses to illegal aliens. The scam allegedly put drivers licenses in the hands more than 1,500 illegal aliens.</p>
<p>On Thursday, police in Palm Beach arrested Willy Adam, 52, and charged him with five counts of unlawful compensation to reward official behavior, and two counts of conspiracy, both felonies.</p>
<p>At his arraignment, Palm Beach County Assistant State Attorney Alan Johnson, told Judge Ted S. Booras that Adam is not a U.S. citizen and presents a flight risk. {snip}</p>
<p>The Palm Beach County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office issued a warrant for Adam in September, along with six others accused of facilitating the scam by issuing bribes, making phony immigration documents, and escorting the illegal aliens to the DMV employees in question.</p>
<p>So far, police have arrested seven license bureau examiners, who are accused of issuing licenses to the illegal aliens without administering either a driving or written test.</p>
<p>The license examiners allegedly received between $1,200 to $2,500 per license, prosecutors believe that those involved made several millions of dollars in the illegal operation.</p>

		<p>I am, I really am, going to complete my top ten list of awakening moments one day soon. One of them took place at the DMV. I was twenty minutes in line and when I got to the counter there was a Central American man in front of me filling out a form for people who didn`t have a birth certificate or Social Security card to get a license. I told the lady that I didn`t know I needed my Social Security card, didn`t have it on me, and please give me the form the guy in front of me was filling out.<br>
 She told me that it was just for people that didn`t have one at all, and that I needed to drive home and come back in with mine.  I asked her why I needed to go home and get mine if he didn`t even have to have one at all?!? The argument got more heated to no avail but ended when a constable started to unhook his handcuffs and walk toward me&hellip; </p>

		<p>You learned that there is one law for Whitey, and another for minorities and illegals. </p>
<p>Something else to reflect on is this: While the &#8220;lady&#8221; behind the counter was probably black, there were probably other Whites around who said nothing, and looked away as if nothing was happening. That is what really burns me when I find myself in the same situation. </p>

		<p>We are putting too much faith in government I.D.  If you don&rsquo;t know a person personally, that person&rsquo;s I.D is NEVER proof of who that person is, so why are we treating government I.D. as if it were proof of good moral character?  Requiring a SSN for a driver&rsquo;s license is a terrible idea anyway since it has nothing to do with passing a driving test, but these double standards mean that it is white people who are left wide open for cyber thieves and not the non-white exceptions.</p>
<p>Untel is right that we need to stop passively accepting anti-white racism.  There is always such a fuss over what year white people will become a minority in the U.S.  I don&rsquo;t see what difference it makes because we won&rsquo;t stand up for ourselves anyway.</p>

		<p>Growing up in South Florida, I know that the Haitians, Cubans, and the Guatemalans run amok there.   I grew up not far from Delray Beach and have spent many afternoons at the DMV there.   Any immigrant horde can trample in there with their computer-printed (coyote-printed) form, all 7 of them take the driving test in the car they all drove in with (yeaup, 7 of them in a 5-seater, real &#8216;safe&rsquo;), and walk out with a picture ID in about an hour.   Little &#8216;ol whitey me, gets to wait in the queue forever - either b/c their online/phone system shat out my appointment again  or  just to be sent on a run-around to fill out the &#8216;proper&rsquo; form and to &#8216;go back home&rsquo; to get whatever-or-not document that I supposedly missed.</p>

		<p>Does this really surprise anyone?  I find it unbelievable that the discussion around the illegal immigration debate still revolves around the notion that immigrants are only here to pick produce, or that they live many to a house, or that they are not paying taxes; those situations do still exist, but just as often the illegal immigrant is now just the guy next door.</p>
<p>Illegal immigrants now occupy many of the jobs on the bottom rungs of the ladder, displacing all others.  They have proper, albeit fraudulent, documentation.  For example, all of the boxes in Home Depot are printed in Spanish and many of the &#8220;shovel ready&#8221; projects funded by the stimulus will only continue to encourage illegal immigration.  These immigrants ARE paying taxes, but they are getting that money back in spades by sending their wives to collect government aid.  They can afford to work for less because the state is underwriting their big expenses like housing, groceries, and health care.</p>
<p>FedEx delivered a large package to my house two weeks ago and I had to point to the spot where I wanted the guy to set the package down.  He barely spoke English.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame the immigrants, I blame the employers and the government for this invasion.  If someone shows up to interview for a job and doesn&rsquo;t speak English then the employer knows dang well what they are hiring, regardless of his documentation. They&rsquo;re hiring this guy because he works cheap, and he can work cheap because the taxpayer is subsidizing his family.  How can an honest American compete with that?</p>
<p>Forget the border fence.  Eliminate government aid to illegal immigrants and put employers of illegals in prison and the problem will go away.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this will be a moot argument in another 10 years.  The children of these immigrants are &#8220;legal&#8221; and will be old enough to vote by then.</p>

<p>And if they are paying Federal income taxes, many of them get it back and more with the Earned Income Tax Credit.  Social Security and Medicare taxes are straight earnings taxes starting with the first dollar of income earned, so while it is true that many of them pay FICA taxes (though the only way you have to pay FICA at all is by means of an above ground job, and there&rsquo;s a paper trail back to the employer for hiring illegal aliens, and/or document fraud on the part of the illegal), the Social Security and Medicare system (FICA) are being cheated because the illegals work for lower wages.  If these were native born white Americans doing the work, then the wages would be higher, and therefore FICA would get more tax money.  With illegals working, the lower pay becomes corporate profits, which aren&rsquo;t subject to FICA.  Therefore, the FICA system&rsquo;s problems are only exacerbated by illegal immigration.</p>

<p>It won&rsquo;t take 10 years, it starts to look like those 20 million illegals will be legal voters wayyyyy sooner than that and then they can vote the treacherous White race traitors out of office since we Whites can&rsquo;t seem to get the job done. SOmehow, I see some fitting justice in that. I am in Afghanistan and the gubmint somehow finds a way to discount our votes every year and I DO VOTE! a fact of which I remind my reps often by fax and e-mail.</p>
