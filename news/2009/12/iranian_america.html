<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-iranian-census29-2009dec29,0,4548553.story">Iranian Americans Are Urged to Stand and Be Counted</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Raja Abdulrahim, Los Angeles Times, December 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since February, Babayi [Nadia Babayi], a U.S. Census Bureau partnership specialist, has been making the rounds at Iranians&rsquo; events, handing out fliers, making pitches and allaying fears in both English and Persian.</p>
<p>Her efforts are part of a first-of-its-kind outreach campaign urging Iranian Americans to specifically identify themselves as Iranian, instead of some other ethnic category, in the 2010 census.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But in June the campaign received an unexpected boost when millions around the world turned out to protest the disputed reelection of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Outraged expatriates and Iranian Americans suddenly found themselves alongside non-Persians at demonstrations.</p>
<p>The opposition green movement may have failed to achieve its goal of political change, but it prompted much of the world to rally behind Iranian people in their struggle for reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has created a sea change in the way Americans view Iranians,&#8221; said Reza Aslan, author of &#8220;How to Win a Cosmic War,&#8221; who moved to the U.S. from Iran in 1979. &#8220;No doubt about it, it&rsquo;s now cool to be Iranian.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979, many Iranian Americans and expatriates chose to keep a low profile in what some saw as a hostile environment. The 1991 film &#8220;Not Without My Daughter&#8221; was blamed for helping to cast a negative light on Iranian men. Starring Sally Field, it depicted an American woman and her daughter fleeing Iran and an abusive husband. And in 2002, then-President Bush declared Iran a member of the &#8220;Axis of Evil.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Members of the community point to a number of reasons for the low count, including fear that cooperation with the census could lead to immigration or tax problems.</p>
<p>Some may have also been hesitant to identify themselves as Iranian or were unaware that they could.</p>
<p>Iranians are labeled white by the U.S. government and in 2000 Suzi Khatami, a producer and host with Radio Iran, didn&rsquo;t know she could categorize herself as anything else on the race question by making the category &#8220;other&#8221; or writing in Iranian American or Iranian.</p>
<p>Aslan, who grew up in Northern California, said he spent the 1980s or &rsquo;90s telling people he was Mexican. Others said they were Italian or Persian.</p>
<p>Jobrani [comedian and actor Maz Jobrani], who is on a comedy tour called &#8220;Brown &amp; Friendly,&#8221; said it wasn&rsquo;t until he reached high school that he realized that some of his countrymen were trying to hide behind the term Persian.</p>

<p>Laughably, I would rather call myself Iranian than Mexican!</p>
<p>While I am not a great fan of the country (or delirious over the idea of some of its inhabitants living here,) the truth is Mexicans are a far greater racial threat to the USA than Iranians ever can or will be. That is simply a fact of geography and demographics. </p>

<p>Without political correctness it would be possible to point out to these people that they left a country they believed was a failure.  That they refuse to accept the truth and want to set up the traditions, religion, customs, and history, of their failed state is startling evidence of their stupidity.</p>
<p>Surely, if they want to be considered separate in all things, then their wishes should be granted.  At least it will be one faction of the US third world population that can easily be identified as not very bright and avoided when necessary.</p>

		<p>Maybe I should write &#8216;Dutchman&rsquo; on the census? I really despise these whiners the most. You left your former homeland to live in the USA. In the case of Iranians many left because of persecution or economic reasons Now you come over here and whine because you are not happy, or feel alienated, etc. BOO HOO! GO HOME THEN! </p>
<p>If I were king I would have a large scarlet &#8220;P&#8221; for Persian tattooed on their foreheads. That way everyone would know that the whiners are from Iran. </p>

		<p>&#8220;John PM&#8221; Excellent observation. In my own experience, folks of Iranian descent were generally altogether caucasian in appearance and behavior alike. NONE, I have ever known expressed any remotely radical ideas religiously or otherwise, as seen by some in Iran, I might add. </p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t want want more Iranians in America - but compared to many immigrants, I can certainly think of far greater threats!</p>

		<p>I remember when the Iranians first came to Los Angeles, 30 years ago.  Some guy came around a  blind corner at a high speed and would have killed me if I&rsquo;d happened to be in the crosswalk.  I looked at him and thought, &#8220;That&rsquo;s an odd looking Mexican&#8221;.  As drivers they were dangerous, as pedestrians they were deliberately in the way, daring you to run them down.  All arrogance, all the time.  I saw them as they really are, without reporters to interpret their actions for me, and I detest them.  I am strongly in favor of these foreigners keeping themselves separate from us, and I would never count them as White.  </p>

		<p>This is actually not that bad of a thing. For far too long the federal government has gotten away with classifying just about anyone except for East Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians or Africans as White. This has been used to both manipulate crime statistics by inflating the number of White crimes as well as giving White Americans a false sense of security that the country is Whiter than it really it and has not been totally bombarded with foreigners who don&rsquo;t even share the same culture as our own. Iranians are indeed Caucasians but they are not European Americans(Whites). It is very much similar in the manner to how Japanese and Indians (the Hindu Variety) are both Asians, but neither are the same. </p>

<p><br>
I don&rsquo;t think it matters for most Iranians, many have a deep seated affection for their homeland and culture. I have talked to a couple that say because of their religion they won&rsquo;t go back home, but my boss is an Iranian Jew (acts and looks 100% American, no one would ever guess he was foreign born) and he frequently goes home to visit family. I have known other Iranian immigrants that visit home frequently and want to retire there.</p>
<p>A lot of Iranian and even Arab kids raised in this country blend in completely, often they don&rsquo;t even look foreign (or if so just barely).</p>

<p>  This is another fine example of the great benefit of being &#8220;white&#8221; in America. We are constantly reminded of &#8220;white skinned privilege&#8221;, and yet many racially white ethnic groups seem anxious to leave the &#8220;white&#8221; category. Could it be the advantages, as far as our government is concerned, are few and far between? </p>

		<p>Iran is a country of 65 million. In appearance they can be swarthy or light skinned, but usually they all have Asiatic black hair.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known a couple of Iranians personally.  They seemed conflicted over their presence in the West, furtive when it came to talking about their homeland, and seemingly uncomfortable about their status here.  I got the impression they were always searching for confirmation that we Westerners genuinely accepted them, and if not, they were quite prepared to carve out their empire on North American soil - within us, but apart from us. </p>
<p>Here in Canada, Persians have distinguished themselves by having numerous high profile murderers, fraudsters, and drug dealers originate from their community. </p>
<p>I would encourage them and all other migrants of non-Western origin not to think of themselves as white. </p>

		<p>To Allan:</p>
<p>The Bahai is a religious sect, NOT an ethnic group. These people are Iranian,whether they are Muslims, Bahai, or Zoroasterian in religious practice.</p>
<p>It would be like a Nigerian-born Methodist. The person would be practicing Methodism, but ethnically, they&rsquo;re Nigerian.</p>

		<p>I think Arabs, Berbers, Kurds, Turks, Persians, and the various ethnic groups of the Indian Subcontinent should be lumped into a single catchall group.  Call them NAMESAns or &#8220;Namesans&#8221; (North African, Middle Eastern, South Asian) for short.  White Europeans and Namesans could be considered related members of a larger group, but still racially distinct from each other.</p>
<p>That makes a lot more sense than calling the President of Iran &#8220;white&#8221; and the Prime Minister of India &#8220;Asian&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Berbers (at least those without much sub-Saharan ancestry)and Anatolian Turks are probably more closely related to southern Europeans than to people from the subcontinent. And there is a big cultural divide between Muslim and non-Muslim South Asians, let alone between Hindus/Sikhs and Middle Eastern Muslims, even if they look a bit alike.</p>

		<p>No, they don&rsquo;t get their own census.  They moved here for a better life and, therefore, are expected to follow our rules, our culture, and our laws.  I&rsquo;m sick of people immigrating to the West who are not only NOT wanted here in the first place, but show their appreciation by whining, complaining, suing us, and disrepsecting us.  Oh, I forgot to mention assaulting and killing us, too.</p>
