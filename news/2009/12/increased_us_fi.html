<h1><a href="https://www.cis.org/north/foreignphdsubsidies">Increased U.S. Financial Support for Foreign PhD Students</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David North, Center for Immigration Studies, December 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hidden within the pages of a newly released, highly regarded federal report on higher education in the U.S. are these facts: in 2008 there were more new PhDs with temporary visas than ever before, and their degree of reliance on American funding, always high, was higher than in earlier years.</p>
<p>The report thus contradicts the claims of academia that foreign students are a boon to the U.S. economy; more on this below.</p>
<p>The annual survey of new PhDs showed that 15,246 of those whose citizenship is known were in the U.S. on temporary visas (such as student visas), compared to 30,791 who were U.S. citizens or permanent residents (green card holders); a table within the report (number 11) indicated that the number of new PhDs with temporary visas was at an all-time high. (Every year about 5 percent of the new PhDs fill out the government&rsquo;s survey, but refuse to report their citizenship.)</p>
<p>Most PhD candidates secure substantial American funding for their long years of graduate study, but this is much more true for those on temporary visas than citizens and green card holders. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All the data on sources of funding in the Summary Report are drawn from the recipients themselves; the only other regularly issued report on who supports foreign students financially {snip} is based on estimates of funding sources made by university foreign student advisers  &mdash;  a group of people who do not handle most of the moneys used to support the foreign students.</p>
<p>Sadly, the information {snip} on the heavy reliance of foreign-born PhDs on U.S. financial sources {snip} will be ignored by the press, but every year a lobbying group for the teaching of foreign students  &mdash;  the Institute of International Education in New York City  &mdash;  will announce with great hoopla, as it did last month, that &#8220;International students contributed $17.8 billion to the U.S. economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The IIE report is called Open Doors and it uses deeply flawed methodology to exaggerate the economic contribution of foreign students to the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>The Open Doors poll of foreign student advisers, IIE&rsquo;s support group, covers both graduate and undergraduate students, a larger population than that of the new doctorates. Its conclusions are seriously skewed for several reasons: 1) it seeks its information on the financing of foreign students from the foreign student advisers, who are second- or third-hand sources; 2) it ignores the basic fact that all American higher education is heavily subsidized by taxpayers and/or endowments, subsidies that are largely invisible to both the foreign students and their advisers, and 3) while virtually all graduating PhDs are willing to report on their own finances, a substantial minority of the foreign student advisers are unwilling to speculate on the question of financial support of the foreign students, and thus the participation rates in the IIE survey are considerably lower than that of the Summary Report.</p>
<p>All of this is covered in more detail in a backgrounder of mine that CIS published last year, &#8220;Who Pays? Foreign Students Do Not Help with the Balance of Payments.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Legal Ph.D. is right on target.  There are a lot of us legal American citizens in PhD programs that have to deal with the day-to-day bias against American students.  Unlike the foreign students, we don&rsquo;t get hefty subsidies and we have to deal with the pervasive anti-American mindset that permeates many of the hard sciences graduate schools.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that this issue does not energize Americans to a greater extent.  Their own children miss out on opportunities for graduate school education, while our universities feverishly recruit foreign students to be educated at American expense.  After their educations in physics, chemistry, electronics engineering etc are complete, many of those students return to their home countries and put their knowledge to work, increasing competition for the USA.  Worse still, more than a few of those students end up working on foreign weapons projects that are intended most specifically for potential use on Americans.</p>
<p>This process has been in effect for several decades, having accelerated in the aftermath of WW II.  Our universities have educated legions of Indians, Pakistanians, Iranians, Chinese, etc in the hard sciences.</p>
<p>Afterwards, by remarkable coincidence, we end up watching impotently as the Indians, Pakistanis, and Chinese develop and test nuclear weapons, making an unstable region even more unstable.  And we hear our government exhorting us to prepare for war with Iran, which is now supposedly a huge danger to us because of their push to develop nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>And while I&rsquo;m typing this message, our universities are stuffed with foreign students who will continue the process.  And those same universities don&rsquo;t have room or funding for many of your own best and brightest.</p>
<p>Might be time to re-think some of our fundamental attitudes and policies on access to education.</p>

		<p>This is not just an issue the US, this is now common in the entire western world. Go to any half-decent European or Australian university campus and you&rsquo;ll be astounded by how many non-whites there are. </p>
<p>I agree with Visine in that I can&rsquo;t understand how whites are so wilfully letting this happen. Why would we not want to keep the competitive advantage we have to push our own to excel? Sooner or later you would think the instinct to covet the best opportunities for one&rsquo;s own would take over. </p>

		<p>Whites (apart from Ashkenazi Jews)  are not competitive in the hard sciences.  Accordingly, most elite Ph.D programs recruit Indian and Chinese students, especially in technical fields where Math skills are highly desired. See www.perotcharts.com where Ross Perot actually acknowledges this phenomenon.</p>

		<p>Our country, its rulers (whomever they may be&hellip;) care more about third world prosperity and interests than they do their own people.<br>
Is it clear yet? They must be voted out and our international and immigratiopn policies be re-evaluated immediately.<br>
We need a nationalist party that is openly against nonwhite immigration and against aggressive interventionist foreign policy.<br>
<i>We don&rsquo;t have much time left.</i><br>
In nonwhite countries, the employ of our type of immigration policy would be considered genocidal towards the host population.<br>
Look up the U.N. definition of genocide.</p>

		<p>As a member of academia, this is one I&rsquo;ve NEVER understood. University of Michigan in particular seems to openly favor anyone who is a non-citizen, particularly if ethnic and even more particularly if female&hellip; though I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s common everywhere. They&rsquo;ll help out a mediocre minority over a qualified white any day of the week and twice on Sundays.</p>

		<p>Schoolteacher:  It is a stretch to say &#8220;Whites&#8221; or any other group for that matter &#8220;created&#8221; the hard sciences. Frontier expanding inventors are a select group of highlly talented people whose intellectual prowess is so unusually rare that it is altogether unrepresentative of any population group. After all Einstein&rsquo;s children ( probably the most connected to the great man himself) were no Einsteins! As far as the general population goes, there is a strong, statistically significant correlation between race and performance in standardized quantitative test scores at least here in the US. In these tests, Asians as a group outperform whites which partially explains why the are overrepresented in elite Ph.D programs in the hard sciences such as MIT, Caltech, and Stanford. As you are a &#8220;schoolteacher&#8221; I&rsquo;m sure you ate aware of that. </p>

		<p>Anonymous NAME any people from China or India with the stature of Newton, Maxwell, or Gauss to name just a few. The scientific method is a Western invention. As for your nonsense about who attends where, this is the entering graduate class for physics at Caltech. Most of Asians are foreign. The whites are local and more than a few names that look to be goy.</p>

		<p>Mark:</p>
<p>most of the &#8220;white&#8221; names sound vey Jewish to me. Singer, Siegel, Cohen, Grayson&hellip; And so what if the Pings, Lee&rsquo;s  and Nandi&rsquo;s are from China and India  (as opposed to being Asian American) ; my point is that even in America&rsquo;s great universities; Asians seem to be overepresemted. Consider this, what percentage of America&rsquo;s overall student body in higher education are Asian (whether local or foreign) and then compare that percentage against the same the elite schools (the top 10).  I think you&rsquo;ll see a distinct skew&hellip; With higher Asian representation both at the elite schools and particularly in the hard science faculties within the elite schools. It&rsquo;s no suprise that MIT is referred to as made in Taiwan, and UC Berkeley, UCLA. Stanford and apparently University of Michigan are inundated with Asian students (as opposed to Ole Miss, Alabama and other such uncompetitive schools). </p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never claimed that  individual whites like Gauss and Newton were not geniuses (much like individual non- whites like Ito or Ramanujan) . My point is that these superior intellectual endowments are isolated to these supremely gifted  individuals rather than being systematically reprentative of their races. The average human IQ is sbout 90 with a standard deviation of roughly 15. As such more than 99.7% of the worlds population ( according to a Gaussian distribution) have an IQ below 135, which even at the high end is hardly genius <br>
material.  Therefore, to claim that Gauss or Newton represent broader white intellect is spurious at best and laughable more generally.  </p>

		<p>Anonymous - You originally stated that whites were no longer competitive in the hard sciences. That is a statement that goes beyond stupidity. There are still well qualified whites in the hard sciences as evidenced by the faculties and grad student bodies of these elite colleges.</p>
<p>That a country of 1.3 billion people can find a few people who can get into Caltech does not indicate Asian superiority. It especially does not when only one Asian-American gets in. </p>
<p>What happened? In two generations all the Asians here got stupid and all those in China got smart?</p>
<p>Other factors are at work. The main thing at work is that getting a PhD is NOT worth it. Getting any advanced degree is likely not worth it when Google will hire grad school level material right out of college and you will make more money and have more fun. You can also get jobs on Wall Street. Asians from overseas do not have this opportunity and coming over here can be a big step up for them.</p>
<p>PhDs can no longer find tenure track positions so Americans are abandoning the programs. The universities are turning to foreigners to fill the spaces. Even with that, there are still alot of whites in these program as you can see from this list (not all are professors).</p>
<p>https://admdbsrv.ligo.caltech.edu/roster/ligo_roster.htf</p>
<p>This is a list of the Caltech people on the LIGO project to detect gravity waves. One of the members got his PhD from Tennesse and took a position at Caltech as a lecturer - no tenure. He was instrumental in developing one of their detectors (Dr. Eric Black) He was thinking of going to a third tier university to get a tenured position but decided to stay because of the work he was doing.</p>
<p>Asians get into school not because they are smarter but because they work harder. I have Chinese friends. Their kids go to Chinese school on the weekends. They are tutored extensively when they need it. They don&rsquo;t have lives.</p>
<p>A few years ago the UC thought they had a trick to get more minorities admitted, they deemphasized the SAT. They thought that the easy grades of the ghetto and barrio schools would get more minorities in. The problem was the Asians were all taking advanced placement clases which have GPAs one point higher than normal. Steve Sailer has pointed out that these Asian &#8220;geniuses&#8221; almost never score that high on their advanced placement TESTS so they are really only inflating their grades. However, this is why Asians are admitted in very high rates. They have higher GPAs not necessarily because they are smarter.</p>
<p>The point about the Newtons is, why is it whites are the only group to have a large amount of super achievers if they as a group are so much stupidier that the Asians who have few super achivers. This doesn&rsquo;t seem to make sense if every population is normally distributed. I don&rsquo;t think Asian intelligence has been shown to be more narrowly distributed than white intelligence. In addition, Germany and Poland are at the top of the national intelligence charts. It can&rsquo;t all be because of the Askanazi in those countries.</p>

		<p>Most asians value education.  In asian cultures, schoolteachers are respected.  <br>
To play &#8220;devil&rsquo;s advocate&#8221; (although I make NO excuses for the dismal state of &#8220;public education&#8221; in the USA) in most countries NOT EVERYONE goes on to &#8220;high school&#8221;.  Students are tested and only the top students go to further their education.  This plays a part in skewing the &#8220;figures&#8221; that show &#8220;foreign students&#8221; as doing better than Americans.<br>
Cultural differences between the races also play a part in education.  To most (American) blacks, education is a &#8220;white man&rsquo;s game&#8221;.  Consequently even their own peers are criticized for &#8220;acting white&#8221;.<br>
Asians take the top slots in the engineering fields.  However, much of the engineering work that they do is merely REFINEMENT of existing product design and operation NOT INNOVATION.<br>
Whites, on the other hand, have been responsible for most of the innovative inventions and the scientific concepts that define much of our world today.<br>
This by no means demeans the hard-working asians or non-american blacks.  However, their mindset is different.  Asians have a fatalistic attitude to life &#8220;whatever will be, will be&#8221;. In asian culture, abuse by authority figures is commonly endured by asians. There is no concept of &#8220;individual freedom&#8221;.<br>
Blacks have a spiritualistic attitude which manifests itself in the significance that is placed on certain &#8220;numbers&#8221; and social interactions.  Magic and voodoo figure prominently in black life.<br>
Whites, on the other hand, have that unique independent streak about them.  The concept of true individual FREEDOM and LIBERTY is almost exclusively a white trait (concept).  This trait is ingrained in white DNA and is responsible for the well-being in much of the world today.  </p>

		<p>6/12 Anon: It is not a stretch to say that Whites created the hard sciences, it&rsquo;s a matter of historical fact.  A White man, Keppler, mathematically plotted the courses of the planets.  A white man, Galileo, discovered that the Earth orbits the sun.  White men invented calculus, the periodic table, and discovered that microbes cause disease.  Etc, etc, etc.  Other people&rsquo;s made accurate observations of the stars and other phenomena, but it was Whites who discovered the reasons behind these things.  <br>
     I am aware that Orientals are statistically overrepresented in certain American graduate programs.  As I wrote in post # 11, the reason is something other than natural ability.</p>
