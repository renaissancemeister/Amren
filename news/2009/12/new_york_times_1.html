<h1>New York Times Raises Eyebrows With Gift Guide for People &#8216;Of Color&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yahoo! News, December 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new addition to the New York Times annual Holiday Gift Guide has sparked a minor uproar after a blog devoted to critiquing the paper termed it &#8220;racist.&#8221; Included in this year&rsquo;s guide, which was published in November, is a page titled &#8220;Of Color/Stylish Gifts.&#8221; This first-time feature is described by the paper as &#8220;gifts created for and by people of color.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>The &#8220;Of Color&#8221; section was compiled by African American reporter Simone S. Oliver and can be found inside the &#8220;Style &amp; Travel&#8221; section of the 2009 Gift Guide. Its contents include:</p>
<p>* &#8220;The Mocha Guide to Military Life,&#8221; a book for African American women with family members serving in the military.</p>
<p>* A &#8220;Wise Latina&#8221; t-shirt, {snip}.</p>
<p>* &#8220;Hair Rules,&#8221; a product for people of color with &#8220;problem hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>* &#8220;Baby Jamz,&#8221; which was created by Beyonce Knowles&rsquo; father and sister, is &#8220;an interactive hip-hop and rhythm-based toy line.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} The conservative website Newsbusters blasted it as a guide for &#8220;race-based holiday shopping,&#8221; while the liberal-leaning media gossip blog Gawker.com called it &#8220;a celebration of the racist assumption that &#8216;people of color&rsquo; are defined by their colors.&#8221; Mediaite questioned the paper&rsquo;s editorial process in putting the guide together, saying that they were &#8220;utterly amazed it made it past the editing process,&#8221; adding that they&rsquo;re &#8220;baffled why anyone felt the need to separate these gifts from the more generalized categories into which all these items fit, to one based on skin color.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yahoo! News spoke to multiple staffers at the paper who expressed divided feelings over the guide. One Times reporter who asked to remain unnamed was mildly flabbergasted, saying, &#8220;After seeing the gift guide, I&rsquo;m guessing all that ink we spilled after the election of Obama about a post-racial America didn&rsquo;t get read internally. It goes right up there in the pantheon of tone-deaf boneheadedness.&#8221; Another reporter who also requested anonymity pointed out that the guide was created by a person of color, saying, &#8220;Critics of the Times tend to do this  &mdash;  they tend to attack something niche-y as if it was formulated and written by The White Powers that Be at the paper, like they&rsquo;re pushing some fetishized version of how black people think and what they would want.&#8221;</p>
<p>When contacted by Yahoo! News for comment, New York Times spokeswoman Diane McNulty provided us with the following statement:<blockquote>Our online gift guides are intended to offer holiday gift ideas for a wide variety of audiences and interests, with Times writers and editors making smart, informed choices that might appeal to those different audiences.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Of Color&#8221; guide, in the Style &amp; Travel category, is in keeping with that philosophy, and with the efforts of a diverse Times staff to directly address minority readers with our content.</p>
<p>Of course, we expect our readers to use the guides however they choose, and we hope they&rsquo;ll find interesting ideas in many different categories. But we&rsquo;ll continue our effort to provide content that&rsquo;s relevant and appealing.<br>

		<p>I personally have no problem with the New York Times doing this.  Anything which alienates white people so much as they reject the NYT is fine by me.  The NYT will go out of business because they are unable to recognize paying customers as such.  No such business deserves to stay in business.</p>

		<p>This is one of the reasons newspapers are going broke. Their strategy is to pander to nonwhites and antiwhites. But whites are the ones who buy and read newspapers. And that&rsquo;s just not a good business decision.</p>

		<p>The Left consistently play fast and loose with the whole &#8220;celebrate diversity&#8221; idea on one hand, and the &#8220;we&rsquo;re all the same/equal, race doesn&rsquo;t exist, etc.&#8221; spiel on the other. They want to divide by race whenever it is convenient(or lucrative)to do so, and then also deny race altogether and condemn anyone who doesn&rsquo;t play along with their deceptive little games, when that works best for them as well. Obviously the whole things positvely reeks of hypocrisy, but that never stopped the Left from any other endeavor, so why should this be any different?</p>

		<p>The only difference between this shopping guide, and the Boise State &#8220;avoid STDs&#8221; t-shirts episode, is that the former was created by a black, and in their view is not racist.</p>
<p>Many here on Amren have said, &#8220;give blacks enough rope, and they&rsquo;ll hang themselves&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well, this is a perfect example.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Of Color&rsquo; section was compiled by African American reporter Simone S. Oliver and can be found inside the &lsquo;Style &amp; Travel&rsquo; section of the 2009 Gift Guide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And one wonders, if Comrade Oliver will be traveling to the moon via an &ldquo;African-American&rdquo; designed rocket; or will she fly to Mars, by way  of the more reliable spacecrafts built in Nubian controlled Egypt that she could have access to with a good credit record?</p>
<p>The nonsense that blacks and other nonwhites come up with to justify their &ldquo;equality&rdquo; with, or even &ldquo;superiority&rdquo; over, whites is laughably limited to multicultural &ldquo;textbooks,&rdquo; and T-shirts. How is this current trend different from blacks in: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Black Thing, You Wouldn&rsquo;t Understand&rdquo; garb in the 90s; or a Mexican with his filthy alien flag flying from his zigzagging car&rsquo;s coat hanger antenna, catapulting down the road with mariachi music blaring? </p>
<p>The answer is, it isn&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>Nonwhites are good at doing about four very specific things:</p>
<p>1.) Believing that evolution did not cancel them out, but only made them more &ldquo;intelligent;&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.) Repeating gibberish in a discordantly malodorous &ldquo;cadence,&rdquo; and believing that this equates with engraving legitimacy onto that &ldquo;brilliant&rdquo; hooting, that follows &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; from point one; </p>
<p>3.)  Hating Whitey and blaming him for all &ldquo;setbacks&rdquo; to their race of overlords;</p>
<p>4.) And finally, acting more violently in practice than their inarticulately grunted or outrageously scrawled mockery of English would indicate as being endurable by truly evolved and civilized humans, let alone ludicrously being &ldquo;celebrated&rdquo; as &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; diversity.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Hey, John.  That&rsquo;s the contradiction of non-white supremacists.  They claim that they are superior to the white man, yet they claim we have &#8216;power&rsquo; and are holding them back.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m seeing this more and more often - cases where minorities &#8220;in power&#8221; come under fire for being &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Time and time again when you see an ad or a product or a law get criticized heavily for being &#8220;racist&#8221; when you follow the trail back to who made the ad, product or law you&rsquo;ll often find a well-intentioned minority, whether it be a latino art director, a black marketing director, or a black politician.</p>
<p>When it is pointed out that it was a fellow &#8220;person of color&#8221; who produced the offending item, then you hear a bunch of nonsense about &#8220;internalized racism&#8221; or &#8220;institutionalized racism.&#8221; </p>
<p>It seems that white people are able to exert magic powers over minorities, compelling them to do racist things to their fellows without otherwise being in any way involved. I&rsquo;m sure that after white people cease to exist in a couple of hundred years, they&rsquo;ll still be blamed for all the &#8220;people of color&rsquo;s&#8221; problems.</p>

No, not quite.  It&rsquo;s not a matter of inability but of UNWILLINGNESS to see the truth. It springs from an ideological commitment, not from an inability to see clearly. </p>

Of course!  just as we still hear whining about slavery today   &mdash;   approaching two centuries after its abolition!   &mdash;   they&rsquo;ll still  be blaming their problems on  &#8220;the lingering effects&#8221; of white racism, or of white privilege, and all the rest of that malarky. Anything to avoid having to face responsibility for their own problems!</p>
