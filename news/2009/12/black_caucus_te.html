			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Silla Brush, The Hill, December 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) members on Wednesday criticized the Obama administration for not doing enough to help African-Americans through the bleak economy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Waters [Maxine Waters] said on Wednesday that the CBC is meeting with the heads of the nation&rsquo;s financial regulatory agencies on foreclosure and lending issues. She emphasized members were lining up meetings with President Barack Obama&rsquo;s advisers to exert their power.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Black Caucus is also working on a proposal to create jobs that it hopes will become part of an effort under discussion among House leaders to bolster the economy.</p>
<p>The CBC efforts underscore the deep anxiety lawmakers have as they face an economy witnessing the highest national unemployment rate in a generation. The unemployment rate for African-Americans is 15.7 percent, compared to the national rate of 10.2 percent.</p>
<p>The CBC members laid out a series of policies they would like to see enacted: efforts to reduce foreclosures, including through principal write-downs; better access to credit for African-American-owned auto dealerships; more aid to small and community banks that lend to African-Americans; and more federal money going to support ad buys in minority radio stations and newspapers.</p>

		<p>&#8220;CBC wants more preferential economic treatment for blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Correction!</p>
<p>The CBC wants preferential treatment for blacks on everything OBVIOUSLY because they can&rsquo;t earn anything on their own, especially academic accreditation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those unspoken truths intelligent whites are aware of, but keep silent about.</p>

		<p>I just posted the following on another webpage on a similar topic. I don&rsquo;t feel like re-typing it to fit this post but I believe it works:</p>
<p><br>
Unfortunately, we come back to the black work ethic. There are job training programs, some of them run by blacks which focus on training blacks.</p>
<p>The problem is that few of the people who join these programs stick it out and graduate. The graduation rate for blacks in these programs is abysmal.</p>
<p>As someone who works for a business that hires many blacks, too many blacks make unreliable workers.</p>
<p>We have a black man who runs a department and he hires blacks. His most reliable and longest lasting employee is a white guy. It frustrates him to no end that the blacks he hires make lousy employees who either get fired for constantly calling off or being no-shows. Others just walk off the job without a word or stop coming to work.</p>
<p>Just today, we had two black women call off. I was talking to one of their black co-worker and she told me that yesterday, both of them went to H&R; Block to get an advances on their taxes. She said, &#8216;you know they&rsquo;re out shopping. That&rsquo;s what black people do&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We had a black guy (who no longer works for us) who came in to pick up his check and said with a broad grin, &#8216;I&rsquo;ll be messed up by noon&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>Didn&rsquo;t the CBC also push to get blacks into their own homes, even if they could not qualify for loans?  How did that work out?</p>

		<p>Right. The thought was that manna from heaven would rain down on black folks. Whatever they so desired would be instantly given to them. After all, they have done without for so long, now it is THEIR turn. Vote for O because we WILL GET something out of all this.</p>

		<p>Why should obama pander to minorities?? Especially blacks? They are going to support him no matter what. A smart political move for the socialist would be to try and garner support from those not already in his camp for the &#8216;12 elections. </p>

		<p>The Obama administration will be happy to give them jobs that require no qualifications purely on the basis of their membership in a victim group, paid by our hard work.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve often wondered, with so many black professionals, bankers, stars, rich people, etc, why they don&rsquo;t do like white people do: get together, make a plan, pool their money and open a business to get even more money.  </p>
<p>Then they can hire people and provide jobs in thier communities.  Instead, it always seems like they are looking to get more black people in places owned or created by whites.</p>
<p>  People can blah blah blah about racism holding them down all they want, but there are enough black millionaires out there to do this stuff, and the laws on the books are very minority-friendly now.  No one gave me a leg up in life.  I come from a poor background.  I worked night and day to get a measure of the American Dream and I stayed out of trouble along the way.  Is that such a hard concept?  </p>
<p>If people say, &#8220;Well, black people are disadvantaged and need more education.&#8221;  Well, we&rsquo;ve been trying to teach good lessons for 50 years, and the situation for Blacks seems to be deteriorating and not improving.  Before 1960, Blacks had more stable communities in the South and far less social problems.  </p>
<p>It was only after they dislocated themselves and moved to the North for factory jobs that their communities began to decline.  Young rootless men (of any race) tend to cause more trouble when taken out of the confining social structures of long established communities.</p>

		<p>Maybe Black Americans think Obama should send each and every Black a hefty weekly paycheck&hellip; so they can sit around and do nothing but complain all day.</p>

		<p>I ran across one of those black panther hand signs the other day. In my mind they need to get rid of the closed fist and go to an open hand stretched out for some freebie, it would be more accurate.</p>

		<p>The black unemployment rate is ALWAYS higher than the rate for whites. Blacks actually believed that the big O was going to &#8216;take care of them&rsquo; and pay their mortgages, etc. They didn&rsquo;t request that he actually find them JOBS. That would involve them having to work. Blacks that want to work are already working.</p>

		<p>I suppose it&rsquo;s too much to ask for it to be recognized that it is unconstitutional for even Obama&rsquo;s government to discriminate on the basis of race, even against whites. This is exactly what the CBC is asking (as usual) and at major taxpayer expense. </p>
