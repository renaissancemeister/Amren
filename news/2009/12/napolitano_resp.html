			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sebastian Rotella, Los Angeles Times, December 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With more Americans suspected in plots, the Homeland Security secretary has stepped up intelligence sharing with state and city law enforcement and increased outreach to Muslim communities.</p>
<p>Responding to a surge of terrorism cases involving American suspects, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says her department is deploying more intelligence analysts nationwide and expanding teams that do outreach with Muslim communities.</p>
<p>In an interview this week, Napolitano outlined a strategy against radicalization that features stepped-up intelligence sharing with state and city law enforcement agencies as well as increased efforts to engage American Muslims and prevent backlash against them.</p>
<p>She suggested that economic hard times and the spread of the Internet have contributed to the challenges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a recent speech, Napolitano issued a strong warning about &#8220;home-based terrorism.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the interview, she said it was hard to pinpoint reasons for the trend, but she noted that economic hard times spur anger and disenchantment. She also cited a wave of propaganda aimed at aspiring American extremists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Napolitano said she has already re-deployed about 36 intelligence analysts from Washington to beef up 72 &#8220;fusion centers&#8221; created around the country during the previous administration.</p>
<p>She intends to send more analysts to those centers, where federal officials work with local investigators to share intelligence and provide training on detecting potential threats.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Napolitano said she is also expanding &#8220;engagement teams&#8221; of the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties that are in charge of improving ties between the government and Muslim communities.</p>

		<p>My comment has nothing to do with the above article but I don&rsquo;t know where else to post it. </p>
<p>I have an idea how Amren could get more funding. It could provide a legal service to members of Amren who had been the victims of anti-white racism. Amren members would pay regular membership fee and in return they would be guaranteed a pro bono lawyer in case they might need it one day to represent them in court. It&rsquo;d be like a health insurance, except that you&rsquo;d be guaranteed a lawyer instead of a doctor. But of course, only those members would be entitled to a lawyer who had been members for a certain amount of time. Or Amren could provide some other service as well, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a legal one. <br>

		<p>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch version of this story had the same headline, but added &#8220;, Deploys More Analysts.&#8221;  If one headline can capsulize everything wrong with modern America, that one can.  Sappy Nappy, as Bruce Jacobs calls her, responds to terrorists with beancounters.</p>
<p><i>Napolitano said she has already re-deployed about 36 intelligence analysts from Washington to beef up 72 &ldquo;fusion centers&rdquo; created around the country during the previous administration.</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Fusion centers.&#8221;  That sure gives me a lot of confidence, especially after the MIAC (Missouri) scandal earlier this year, where the whole report blamed right wingers and pretty much cut-and-pasted the ADL and SPLC.</p>

<p>She undoubtedly is referring to tea party advocates as &#8220;aspiring American extremists,&#8221;  since she&rsquo;s issued scare memos written by the ADL and SPLC to watch out for people protesting the present administration, completely ignoring the real, legitimate terrorist threats to the country. </p>
<p>Because she regards jihadist camps and Muslum imams who train and preach jihad as a lesser threat than conservative American citizens, it&rsquo;s more than apparent she&rsquo;s clueless about what the real threats are today.</p>
<p>One VERY IMPORTANT expert in particular is forcasting another attack in this country of 9-11 proportions during 2010.  </p>
<p>From what I have read, regarding the increase in civilian deaths by US military drones and missiles in Pakistan and Afghanistan, stepped up attacks will occur against American citizens and assets, both in this country and elsewhere beginning in 2010, as reprisals against these US caused deaths.</p>
<p>And, because of the benign attitude toward real terrorists, Janet Napolitano will be one of the chief causes of terrorism here, and I look for a large scale third party movement forming in 2010 with Sarah Palin as the rallying figure, but I don&rsquo;t look for her to actually commit herself as its head until after the 2010 elections.  </p>
<p>Much will have changed by then, and, quite possibly, Obama and his minions could very well be the best thing that ever happened to the white nationalist movement in this country as well.  Many mainline conservatives will have been exposed to anti-white bias and hatred in the two years of his tenture, with two more years left in his term to offer much more of the same.</p>

		<p>9-11, and the dozens of other Muslim-instigated terrorist acts against Americans would never have happened if we had not allowed Millions of Muslims into the USA.  </p>
<p>The USA is spending millions of Dollars a month to track immigrant Muslims, and these terrorists continue to plot against us and kill us, yet, our government refuses to place a moritorium on Muslim immigration.  Why?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve eluded to it in some of my previous posts.  If there is major &#8216;terrorist&rsquo; strike on US soil such as a nuclear or dirty bomb in a couple of major US cities, that may mark the beginning of the end.</p>
<p>The concern I would have would be a declaration of Martial law.  Once declared, there would have no more rights.  To push back would be dealt with severally if not lethally.  We have become so polarized as a nation that it would be difficult for our people to recover.  Once the law is lifted,we will not be the same country.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I would do if I had to plan a major restructuring of the US.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s on fire and I hope I am very wrong on this and that I am being just too paranoid.</p>

<p>Why? Because the ultimate agenda is the elimination of White people from the US if not literally, at least as force with which to be reckoned. Whites are the only group who represent a serious obstacle to the NWO. They are hitting us from all sides with enemies. For years they&rsquo;ve ignored the depredations of Blacks against innocent Whites and now we have Muslims whose stated goal is the destruction of the West. <br>

		<p>my apologies for no cap&rsquo;s or certain punctuation d/t broken keyboard.</p>
<p>with her dismal and disasterouly outrageous ineptitude in protecting her home state of arizona from the mexican invasion - which will in a short amount of time, completely destroy her beautiful and formally wealthy state - i can&rsquo;t imagine a worse choice by obama for protection of our nation from angry and hostile muslim extremists. when poll after poll show even &#8221;peaceful&#8221; muslims, as liberals love to call them, show that close to half of those peaceful muslims admit being in favor of the destruction and control of the west, including the united states. when are these liberals - including napalitano - get off being so naive. <br>
according to the koran, a &#8221;good&#8221; muslim is one who is by our standards, intolerant and in favor of violent methods to achieve their goal of domination and control by the &#8221;flame or the sword&#8221;. these are their own defintions and teachings. a &#8221;peaceful&#8221; muslim by our standards is a &#8216;backslider&rsquo; and disobedient by their definition.<br>
sorry if i&rsquo;ve insulted any muslims reading this, but it is my opinion based on the best readings and research i have done. <br>
we are facing an enemy far worse - and &#8216;patient&rsquo; - than any we&rsquo;ve ever faced before. one that has obeys no semblance to civilized sort of conduct in warfare who we have ever faced. </p>
<p>the sooner we can realize this - and ditch the political correctness - the sooner we can deal with this different sort of enemy in an effective manner.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;God forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion. The people cannot be all, and always, well informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented, in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions, it is lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. &hellip; And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time, that this people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to the facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure.&rdquo;  &mdash;  Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p>I agree. But also I think she so flippantly demonizes conservatives, rather than Muslims, who are the real threat, because she knows she has no fear of violence from the tea partiers and others, but the jihadist threat will respond with violence against that same kind of incindiary rhetoric directed against them.</p>
<p>So, once again, it is only the real threat of force those corrupt demagogues like her really fear.  She treats the rest of us with disdain, people who can be insulted, demonized and hated all in one breath, because we believe in mom, God, and apple pie, three things she utterly despises, just like Nancy Pelosi who called the patriot crowds Nazis.</p>
<p>Neither one of these disgusting corrupters of all things good would dare flap their lips in protest against real terrorists if they thought violence would result if they did, because they&rsquo;re cowards of the highest order.</p>

<p>As the facts show, wherever islam lives, so does terrorism.  </p>
<p>America will Always and Forever have terrorist acts committed against her Citizens on her very own soil as long as there are muslims in America. </p>

&ldquo;Beginning next month, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said, those who arrive in the United States fleeing torture or persecution abroad will no longer automatically be welcomed with handcuffs and months in a jail cell. Instead, many of those seeking protection will again be permitted to live freely in the country while their applications for permanent asylum are considered by an immigration judge.&rdquo; </p>
