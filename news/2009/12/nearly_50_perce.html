			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Oosting, MLive.com, December 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The unemployment rate in Detroit fell slightly last month to 27 percent, according to preliminary data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor  Statistics.</p>
<p>But that official figure may not tell the whole story.</p>
<p>The Detroit News, using a broader definition of unemployment, reports that as many as 45 percent of the working-age Detroiters are without full-time employment.</p>
<p>That estimate  &mdash;  which includes part-timers who want full-time work and those who have given up looking  &mdash;  backs up a statement made by Mayor Dave Bing at last week&rsquo;s White House Job Summit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Michigan&rsquo;s unemployment rate is 15 percent; Detroit is 30 percent reported but in reality it&rsquo;s probably close to 50 percent,&#8221; Bing told a group as he pitched for aid.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As MLive.com&rsquo;s Sven Gustafson reported in September, Michigan&rsquo;s nation-leading unemployment rate would be much worse if it included those who gave up and stopped looking for jobs.</p>

		<p>The unemployment state legerdemain isn&rsquo;t just true in Michigan, it&rsquo;s true for the whole country.  However, Michigan is our canary in the coal mine.  If the canary dies, you&rsquo;re about to.  Some counties in rural Michigan are resorting to letting formerly paved roads revert to gravel, because they can&rsquo;t afford to maintain them.</p>
<p>Michigan&rsquo;s desperate situation is the reductio ad absurdum of Republocratic free trade/open borders/racial equality policies of the last 50 years.</p>
<p>If I were advising a Republican running for President in 2012, I would advise him or her to focus heavily on MI and have the National Convention in Detroit.  Since Michigan is only Ohio and Pennsylvania plus 10 years of decline, winning MI is also winning OH and PA.  And it&rsquo;s not unprecedented for a racial right-winger to win MI:  George Wallace, 1972, Democrat Primary.  Also, affirmative action ban passed by a wide margin in 2006.</p>

		<p>These statistics are very similar to those in Black-African countries, as well as other majority-Black nations outside of Africa, such as Haiti.  </p>
<p>We need to face the cold hard fact that Africans are, as a group, unable to maintain any sort of modern civilization.  As America replaces its European-derived population with more-and-more Africans over the next few decades, we will see lower national academic achievement, higher unemployment, crime, and social pathologies, and a destroyed economy and greater National poverty.   </p>

<p>Dee-troit needs to be abandoned and at some point in the future, maybe 100 years or so, someone can come in and start over. A lot of those bricks from torn down buildings can be sold for exotic antique building material to be used in Japan, Korea, China, etc. And game preseves can be stocked with wild game birds and such.</p>
<p>See, there is hope after all!</p>

		<p> My guess would be that at least 45 percent of the 50 percent is &#8220;people who wouldn&rsquo;t work if you held a gun to their head.&#8221; All this stuff about &#8220;still looking&#8221; and &#8220;discouraged and has given up&#8221; is just a polite, eyes-averted cover-up.</p>
<p> We&rsquo;ve made it too easy in this country for people to go through most of their working lives, NOT working, and don&rsquo;t think there aren&rsquo;t plenty of lazy people all too willing to game the system and take advantage of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Student math scores in Detroit were the lowest in the nation and the lowest in the history of national testing&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Time magazine reports the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.&rsquo;These numbers are only slightly better than what one would expect by chance as if the kids had never gone to school and simply guessed at the answers&rsquo;, said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Washington-based Council of the Great City Schools, which represents large urban school districts.</p>
<p>Detroit Public Schools students posted the worst math scores in the 40-year history of the National Assessment of Educational Progress test&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>This being Time magazine, the story was assigned to a black journalist to get to the  &#8216;root cause&rsquo; of the embarrassingly low test scores.  He opened with this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Detroit&rsquo;s children come with all the same equipment as any other kid, if not more so. Children here are born as capable as kids anywhere else&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>So blame, as always, from blacks, the media and academia is placed on, &#8220;corruption, incompetence, underfunding, mismanagement, laziness, racism, blind arrogance, materialism, nihilism, resignation, &#8216;the low bigotry of soft expectations&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what Jack Cashill calls the ABETTO factor  &mdash;  A Blind Eye To The Obvious  &mdash;   blaming everything else except the real reason:  average black IQs of 85 and the impossibility of raising IQ level through education.</p>
<p>The solution, especially in a hell-hole such as Detroit?  More screams for money.  After all, who is brave enough to stand up and tell the black community (and the ADL, ACLU, $PLC, NAACP, the Justice Department and any other advocacy group that blindly backs blacks against Whites) the absolute facts about low black IQ and black pathology?  </p>
<p>Who would want to risk his life pointing out such Hate Facts?</p>

		<p>well these are the same people who when they lost their jobs they would get a 2 year &#8220;job pool&#8221; salary at full pay from the automakers.  if they expect jobs like that&hellip; well of course they will fail.</p>

		<p>Parents in Detroit are calling for prison time for school officials.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good idea, since they are probably all black anyway, they could continue teaching the students in prison. Unless of course!! they meant only White teachers if there are any, since only Whites could be responsible for black failure.</p>

		<p>The trouble is, a lot of those people from Detroit have been fanning out in the suburbs in search of benefits (read: sponging off whitey).  </p>
<p>Imagine my horror last year, when I went to visit my old hometowm, in the whitest of the white belt, to see black kids, swaggering, in the center of my small town.  That has never, ever happened before.  Then, when I went to the lake I grew up on, there were a bunch of black kids there, at the beach, swimming.  It seemed so surreal.  </p>
<p>Today, I live in a 90% non-white city in another state (don&rsquo;t ask - I need a job), and I always looked forward to my journey home to revisit a culture that seems so far away to me now - simple small town America.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, one of the blacks was a hulking teenage boy - and three, count them - three - delierious white girls were literally hanging all over him in the water.  I mean they each literally had an arm around his shoulder and were all over him shamelessly in that stupid white girl way.  He looked like an illiterate thug - really.  He wasn&rsquo;t one of the &#8220;good&#8221; blacks by any measure. I was so disgusted, my hometown felt tainted.  I do not look forward to returning now.</p>

		<p>Detroit fell to black rule after riots drove most of the whites out.  As an example of his governing style, Mayor Coleman Young appointed a cop &#8220;from the &#8216;hood&#8221; to be police chief and had a giant black-fist statue erected downtown.  <br>
Since most of the denizens of these places survive on welfare anyway, the federal government should just declare such cities  to be reservations, like those of Native Americans.  Blacks with ambition could leave and try living elsewhere, just like the Natives do sometimes.  Murder, drug fatalities, disease, and abortion (50% of black pregnancies) keep the black population between 12-13% as it is.</p>

<p>To explain the grinding poverty among whites in Appalachia, someone I know once told me that the lack of industry there, mainly due to free trade and fanatical environmentalism, means there&rsquo;s no way in those places for people to make a good living.  Therefore, exact quote, &#8220;anyone who had any sense of get up and go got up and went.&#8221;  In other words, there became a situation o reverse eugenics   &mdash;   ambitious people left, leaving unambitious people to procreate.</p>
<p>What you say means that Detroit is becoming the black version of eastern Kentucky, only much worse.  Blacks with ambition are leaving, those that don&rsquo;t stay, creating a permanent and persistent 3rd world settlement.</p>

<p><b>I want the whites to move out of Detroit.</b> Come to your senses, forget about the town your grandfather helped build, forget about how it used to have <b>stately</b> buildings worthy of anything in London or Paris (!), and leave.  You can&rsquo;t fix that sunken ship.</p>
