<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34514093/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/">Is Facial Recognition Software Discriminatory?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Suzanne Choney, MSNBC, December 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A video posted on YouTube shows HP&rsquo;s facial recognition software tracking the movements of a white face, but not a black one, something the video&rsquo;s maker calls &#8220;racist,&#8221; but the computer giant says is definitely not.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Texas man, Desi Cryer, who is black, was at work in a retail store with a fellow employee who is white when the two recorded a test of the facial recognition software on a new HP computer and posted the result on YouTube.</p>
<p>Cryer got in front of the webcam, moved back and forth and said, &#8220;It&rsquo;s supposed to follow me as I move  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m black  &mdash;  I think my blackness is interfering with the computer&rsquo;s ability to follow me.&#8221; The camera did not track his movements.</p>
<p>His co-worker, Wanda, got into the frame, and &#8220;you immediately see what I&rsquo;m talking about,&#8221; Cryer said. &#8220;Now as you can see, the camera is panning to show Wanda&rsquo;s face, it&rsquo;s following her around .&nbsp;.&nbspp;. but as soon as my blackness enters the frame, it stops.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We are working with our partners to learn more. The technology we use is built on standard algorithms that measure the difference in intensity of contrast between the eyes and the upper cheek and nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that the camera might have difficulty &#8216;seeing&rsquo; contrast in conditions where there is insufficient foreground lighting,&#8221; the company says. &#8220;While we work on this, take a look here for more information on the impact of lighting on facial tracking software, and how to optimize your webcam experience: http://bit.ly/7HsZHD.&#8221;</p>
<p>The link goes to a Web page about &#8220;Using the HP TouchSmart Webcam,&#8221; which notes: &#8220;It has been reported that lighting conditions can affect the performance of the face tracking feature.</p>

Yet again, blacks are given a golden opportunity.</p>
<p>This is the black mans chance to write facial recognition software that works for all racial skin tones and then become a computer software millionaire.</p>
<p>Instead, the black man will give this problem to the white man to solve for him. The black man will feel he made a difference for his race by standing up to racism. All the black man ever does is get a few crumbs while white software programmers are going to get wealthier.</p>
<p>This is all blacks ever get from their whining. A couple token jobs, a few words of apology, an acknowledgment that they&rsquo;re concerns are important.</p>
<p>In the end, they get little or nothing. <br>

		<p>I was so sure, years ago, when we finally eliminated all those racist vacuum tubes.  Life would be one big holiday without the racist golden glow of vacuum tubes.  But I was wrong.  Transistors.  Especially light skin loving transistors.  They are just as bad.  They seem to forget the days when people were skeptical of their performance.  We never learn.<br>

		<p>My first impression, while admitting that I&rsquo;ve never used that technology, is that there might be a setting that must be adjusted to optimize the camera.  Since the vast majority of users are not black, it should be no wonder that the default setting is for lighter skin.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Cryer got in front of the webcam, moved back and forth and said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s supposed to follow me as I move &mdash; I&rsquo;m black &mdash; I think my blackness is interfering with the computer&rsquo;s ability to follow me.&rsquo; The camera did not track his movements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honestly, I think that this says more about MSNBC and HP then it does about Desi and Wanda here. To me it appears that the two are laughing about this whole scenario and sort of mocking its &ldquo;implications.&rdquo; As the original article points out, they both work in a retail store selling these things and they may have picked up that it displays this &ldquo;racist&rdquo; anomaly in that particular setting. Indeed, given their jocularity in the video, I will give them the benefit of the doubt. </p>
<p>After all, if you are having a slow day at work or a break in the normal holiday intensity, who hasn&rsquo;t done something silly like this in a retail job? In the end, isn&rsquo;t that what makes a lot of the more obvious drawbacks (low pay and irrationally rude customers being the most notable) somewhat bearable? </p>
<p>As for MSNBC and HP, all I can do is roll my eyes and ask this: what else would you expect from such &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; entities? </p>
<p>Merry Christmas Everybody,</p>

		<p>In the news today we learn that webcams and gravity are racist.  Along with taxation on the patrons of tanning beds, the pending healthcare bill should contain incentives for the manufacture of ointments which lighten skin.</p>

		<p>Another case of a black being oversensitive. The geek in me decided to test this with the free Mac software I Love Photos, which has face recognition, and it had equal success (or failure) with both white and black faces (the newest version of iPhoto has the same feature).</p>
<p>Just as HP said, lighting conditions seem to be a big factor. The software failed to detect the face of a white woman in a string of photos  taken under the same lighting conditions, but had no trouble with the same woman under different lighting.</p>
<p>Again, another case of a black being very race conscious.</p>

		<p>Having once been a professional photographer, I can testify that taking a group photo of mixed blacks and Whites is always a problem.  Exposing correctly for the entire frame usually makes the black faces fade into indistinguishability unless the &#8220;blacks&#8221; are very light-skinned.  Trying to blame it on &#8220;racism&#8221; would only be taken seriously in an amerika gone mad.</p>

		<p>This entire episode is deserving of some serious in-depth consideration. It is obvious that only half of the participants are White which does not reflect the true composition of the racial make-up of the USA. Moreover, there is only one female involved, the rest being black males. The HP camera followed only the White female and ignored the others, perhaps to ensure she was under constant CCTV observation and to protect her well being and safety. The only black male insisted several times that a White female appear before the camera and so demonstrated sexual and racial discrimination against all black females. Computer programmes are easily configured to reverse the composition of all black and White images but no attempt was made to implement this feature which is unsettling from a cultural point of view. Does this software express taste, preference, predilection, inclination, discernment, judgement, finesse, refinement, culture, polish or, as the news report has it, discrimination. Desi Cryer says he bought one of these kits and took it home. If he thinks it is faulty and cannot &#8216;track&rsquo; black africans, this begs the question of why he bought it in the first place. However, if he intended to demonstrate some implied racial slur, he would need some White participation as a control mechanism. No doubt he would enlist the assistance of his nearest AMREN commentator for a fair, unbiased opinion of the affair.</p>

		<p>It is common knowledge among image makers that you need to light up darker skin tones up to 4-5 times more, because the darker your hue, the more light you absorb and not reflect back into the camera as lighter skin tones may. Alternately, some very light hues need to be toned down because of the amount of that reflection.</p>
<p>This is exponentially more true of digital cameras, because you are using a CCD (a Charge-Coupled Device) which has a lowered dynamic range (the ratio between lights (highlights) and darks (shadows) in an image) than true film emulsions (a reactive chemical process).</p>
<p>Ever notice how darker skinned persons on television or in professional photography have bigger white glares in their eyes than others? It is an indicator of the increase in lights/lamps that must be employed to get the right exposures reflecting off their eyes.</p>
<p>Because of these established scientific facts, this complaint has zero merit.</p>

		<p>Look at the optimistic side of the story, criminal blacks should be pleased as it means that surveillance cameras too are less effective in determining their features and hence identity.</p>
