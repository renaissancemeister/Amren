<h1>On National Test, 69 Percent of Detroit Children Score Below Basic on Fourth Grade Math; 77 Percent Below Basic on Eighth Grade Math</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steven Wasko and Jennifer Mrozowski, Detroit Public Schools, December 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>According to results being released today, Detroit schoolchildren ranked the lowest in the nation of participants on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) math test.</p>
<p>In terms of performance levels in the fourth grade in Detroit on the math test, 69 percent of students scored at a below basic level. In terms of performance levels in the eighth grade in Detroit, 77 percent were below basic.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a complete indictment of the adult leadership in this district,&#8221; said Robert Bobb, Emergency Financial Manager of Detroit Public Schools. &#8220;We want people to have not just a sense of urgency after seeing these scores, but a sense of outrage over these scores. Failure of this magnitude is not the fault of children, individually or collectively. It cannot be attributed to parental shortcomings, real or imagined. It is directly the result of the failure to lead, failure to manage, failure to establish rigorous academic and strong professional standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we also do not want this to paralyze us,&#8221; Bobb said. &#8220;On the contrary, knowing where our children are academically provides us the opportunity to strategically develop and tailor our academic program to the specific needs of Detroit children.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NAEP test is given nationally every two years in reading and math and offers results and a comparison for the performance of students across the nation and for the states. Every state is required under &#8220;No Child Left Behind&#8221; to participate. However, individual school districts are not required to participate. Detroit has been participating in NAEP, but this is the first time the district&rsquo;s individual results can be reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;These results are unconscionable,&#8221; said Dr. Barbara Byrd-Bennett, Chief Academic Auditor for DPS. &#8220;And we will not let the children of Detroit continue to suffer from the lack of leadership and rigorous curriculum that got them to this point. We are planning a complete remake of our academic program so our standards are aligned with the national standards on the NAEP test. This will ensure Detroit&rsquo;s children can compete against not just Michigan&rsquo;s students, but compete with students across the nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Detroit was one of a special group of urban districts tested as part of the Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA). Detroit participated in the TUDA at the suggestion of national experts and DPS school officials who were anxious to have a benchmark of comparison for Detroit against other cities nationally and to gauge the rigor of Detroit&rsquo;s academic program.</p>
<p>In the year 2000, the Council of the Great City Schools approached the National Assessment Governing Board and proposed allowing the nation&rsquo;s largest city school systems to be over-sampled in order to get city-specific results. Up to that time, NAGB was not allowed to report results below the state level and city samples were too small to report.</p>
<p>The first testing was done in reading in 2002 in six cities as part of the Trial Urban District Assessment or TUDA, but Detroit was not one of them. Math was added in 2003. By 2005, 11 cities were participating and science was added.</p>
<p>In 2009, seven more cities were added, including Detroit for the first time, to make the total number of cities participating 18. The 2009 testing was completed in late January of this year through the first week in March.</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth here is that no jurisdiction of any kind in the history of NAEP has ever registered such low numbers,&#8221; said Michael Casserly, Executive Director of the Council of the Great City Schools. &#8220;They are just above what one would expect by chance alone  &mdash;  as if the kids simply guessed at the answers. These numbers  &mdash;  to our mind  &mdash;  are shocking, appalling, and outrageous and should not be allowed to stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Casserly said only a complete overhaul of the DPS school system and how it teaches the city&rsquo;s children should be permitted at this point because the results signal a complete failure of the adults who have run the schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;We encourage  &mdash;  in the strongest possible terms  &mdash;  that this city devote the same sense of urgency, immediacy and centrality to raising student achievement as it is successfully devoting to revamping the school district&rsquo;s finances and operations,&#8221; Casserly said. &#8220;It will matter little if the district balances the books but the kids cannot read and do math.&#8221;</p>
<p>The results:</p>
<p>Students were assessed in grades 4 and 8 only.</p>
<p>The average scale score for the nation&rsquo;s 4th graders in math in 2009 was 239 on the 0-500 scale. The average scale score for Michigan&rsquo;s 4th graders was 236  &mdash;  just below the national average. The average scale score for the nation&rsquo;s large central cities was 231 in 2009  &mdash;  with the highest city (Charlotte) scoring at 245.</p>
<p>Detroit&rsquo;s 4th graders scored at 200  &mdash;  the lowest of all 18 participating cities. The next lowest scoring city (Fresno) was 19 points higher than Detroit.</p>
<p>In terms of performance levels in the 4th grade, nationally, some 6 percent of 4th graders scored at the advanced level, 33% were proficient, 43% were basic, and 19% were below basic. In Michigan, 5% were advanced, 30% were proficient, 43% were basic, and 22% were below basic. Among the large central cities, 5% were advanced, 24% were proficient, 43% were basic, and 28% were below basic.</p>
<p>In Detroit, there were no measurable students at the advanced level, 3% were proficient, 28% were basic, and 69% were below basic.</p>
<p>On a typical problem involving a student having to subtract a two-digit number from a three-digit number  &mdash;  say 301 minus 75  &mdash;  67% of the nation&rsquo;s 4th graders will get the right answer as will 63% of urban students generally. Only 33% of Detroit&rsquo;s 4th graders get the right answer.</p>
<p>In all, Detroit 4th graders scored at the 9th percentile nationally.</p>
<p>The average scale score for the nation&rsquo;s 8th graders in math in 2009 was 282  &mdash;  a number that is not comparable to the 4th grade number even though they are both on a 0-500 scale. The average scale score for Michigan&rsquo;s 8th graders was 278.The average scale score for the nation&rsquo;s large central cities was 271 in 2009  &mdash;  with the highest city (Austin) scoring at 287.</p>
<p>Detroit&rsquo;s 8th graders scored at 238  &mdash;  the lowest of all 18 participating cities.</p>
<p>In terms of performance levels in the 8th grade, nationally, some 7% of 8th graders scored at the advanced level, 25% were proficient, 39% were basic, and 29% were below basic. In Michigan, 7% were advanced, 24% were proficient, 37% were basic, and 32% were below basic. Among the large central cities, 5% were advanced, 18% were proficient, 36% were basic, and 40% were below basic.</p>
<p>In Detroit, there were no measurable students at the advanced level, 4% were proficient, 18% were basic, and 77% were below basic.</p>
<p>On a typical problem asking students to calculate the probability of picking a particular-colored pencil out of a basket of pencils in three colors, 77% of 8th graders nationally get the right answer as did 67% of urban 8th graders. Only 34% of Detroit&rsquo;s 8th graders got the right answer.</p>
<p>Detroit&rsquo;s 8th graders scored at the 12th percentile nationally.</p>
<p>The sample included about 900 of Detroit&rsquo;s approximately 6,000 4th graders and about 1,000 of the district&rsquo;s 6,000 8th graders. The sample was done on a random basis by a federal contractor and not by the school system. The sample included some of the district&rsquo;s highest performing elementary schools. The test consisted of about 50 items on a test lasting about an hour.</p>
<p>The results of the reading and science assessments are forthcoming.<br>

		<p>I think the reason why Detroit&rsquo;s (and most black) children seem relatively OK in the 4th grade but fall behind in the 8th grade is because black children tend to develop more quickly than white children, in terms of infant and child physical and brain development.  But only up to a point   &mdash;   4th grade is generally the inflection point where black mental development slows down, and whites catch up and surpass the black children.  This is why the liberal all love head start   &mdash;   it &#8220;seems&#8221; to work, and &#8220;seems&#8221; to close the racial gap, only because that&rsquo;s when blacks are most on par or ahead of whites, the pre-K years.</p>
<p>Another problem is blaming teachers&rsquo; unions all the time.  I&rsquo;m not for the NEA and their leftist extremism, but don&rsquo;t forget that white suburban and rural schools also have teachers that are NEA members, but that doesn&rsquo;t preclude those students from learning.</p>

		<p>Hmm?<br>
Do they need to be in a classroom with mostly white children?<br>
Oh right, been there, done that&hellip;massive fail.</p>
<p>Well, do the teachers need to go through intensive white privilage studies because they are inherently racist?<br>
Oh, right. The students were in black schools with black teachers.</p>
<p>So now what?<br>
Will they bus all these kids out to white suburban schools (which are becoming less white by the day) or tax the whites to pay for new buildings, new computers etc.(but the money will be pocketed by the admins) or lower the standards (which they are doing already)?? So many choices.</p>
<p>Like one of my black colleagues used to say, &#8220;You can&rsquo;t teach stupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t possible to teach unteachables.  No one can learn above the level he is restricted to.</p>
<p>The only ones dumber than the kids are the administrators.</p>

		<p>The problem is manifold:</p>
<p>1) Under funding of black schools.<br>
2) Too many students per teacher.<br>
3) Not enough black teachers to act as role models.<br>
4) Discrimination on the part of white teachers.<br>
5) Tests that discriminate against blacks.<br>
6) Old school buildings.<br>
7) Not enough after school help.<br>
8) Free breakfast and lunch, but no free supper.<br>
9) Teacher&rsquo;s unions.<br>
10) Euro-centric math books.<br>
11) Not enough teacher aids in the class room.<br>
12) Insufficient Afro-Centric readers.<br>
13) Not enough white students to sit next to.<br>
14) Insufficient bussing.</p>
<p>and most of all:</p>
<p>Not enough money is spent on urban students.</p>

<p>No, it does not indicate that the teachers are incompetent.</p>
<p>I remember reading an American Renaissance publication in which a great multicultural endeavor in Kansas was undertaken. Well over a billion dollars was spent constructing a super school that had all sorts of unnecessary extravagances. The point of this super school was to prove that whites and inner city blacks would get along perfectly and blacks would thrive with the right environment.</p>
<p>The results didn&rsquo;t come as intended.</p>
<p>There was still self-segregation and blacks were not performing as well academically.</p>
<p>This multicultural endeavor is proof that no matter the school, the matter the teachers and no matter the environment, blacks will still lag behind. Always.</p>

		<p>This is what happens when blacks control everything. The city is bankrupt, the housing market has imploded, it looks like hurricane Katrina minus the water. It is the same throughout the world wherever blacks congregate in large numbers. It is the same tired excuses by the same people. It all comes down to DNA.</p>

		<p>The educators have a lot of work to close the gap between the races. I bet though the parents are not helping or encouraging their kids to try hard. So typical of black parents&hellip;.just sit back, be lazy and whine when the system cannot teach their stupid kids.</p>

<p>(15) No carpeting on the floor.</p>
<p>Just before I started college, a black mother-mother&rsquo;s live in boyfriend-daughter moved in on the block where I lived.  She had attended St. Louis City Public Schools from KG to the 7th grade, (she had just finished 7th when they moved in), but her mother entered her into St. Louis&rsquo;s inter-district deseg for the next school year, she started 8th at a suburban 90% white district.  The mother told me that &#8220;since they&rsquo;ve got carpet on the floors out there, maybe my daughter will learn better.&#8221;  St. Louis City schools, most of them older, don&rsquo;t have carpeted floors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are very few carpeted floor classrooms and labs at MIT.</p>

		<p>So the &#8220;Adult Leadership&#8221; is to be blamed for their low test scores.This goes om and on everywhere across the nation. It is not the &#8220;Adult Leaderships&#8221; fault, or blacks fault. It is solely due to genetics.</p>

<p>The NUMBERS should not be allowed to stand, eh?  But apparently the worthless educational system is A-OK.</p>
<p>Just keep telling yourself, &#8220;Diversity is our strength&#8221;, and don&rsquo;t worry about the low test scores.  Minority children don&rsquo;t need to score highly on exams, all they have to do is be able to intimidate Whites into supporting them for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>So far, that strategy is working tremendously well for them.</p>

		<p>The most elite Whites in academia and the government love stories like this, because it means they will be able to funnel even more money from your wallet through their lecherous hands to the bottomless pit in Black urbania.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the government will never (a)repatriate the Blacks back to Africa, and (b) admit that no amount of time or money can fix this problem because it has a genetic basis. Doing either would sabotage their own gold mine operation.</p>
<p>What they *will* do, instead, is hope that enough young, white daughters are impregnated by blacks so that eventually the offspring can score slightly higher on the tests. Then, they will sound the victory alarm for having proven all of us wrong.<br>

		<p>There is a bigger and a systemic problem here folks.  The national average for fourth grade turns out to be a whopping 48% achievement out of 100%.  Normal passing scores are at lowest 60% and that is a bare D grade.  The entire country is flunking!<br>
No surprise that of all the flunkees, blacks have the lowest scores and Detroit blacks are at the bottom.  Nearly everybody white has FLED Detroit, thus there are no whites bringing up that average.  Emphasized again, the national average is a flunking score by any standards.  We can attribute that dismal score overall to the salting of every class with blacks from wherever they can be bussed.</p>

		<p>Yes, so typical.  So expected.  So trite.</p>
<p>It seems to me, fundamentally, this dismal showing has to be the fault of either 1) the kids themselves, 2) the kids&rsquo; parents or 3) the educational system.</p>
<p>Of the three, I&rsquo;d say the least fault resides with the educational system, even though I&rsquo;m sure it stinks to high heaven.</p>
<p>So, of course, only the educational system gets blamed.</p>
<p>The parents have to come next.  If my kids were coming home from school and I saw they couldn&rsquo;t do basic math (or read), I&rsquo;d notice it, I&rsquo;d care about it, and I&rsquo;d try to do something about it.</p>
<p>The kids themselves have to be blamed, too, because teachers can&rsquo;t be miracle workers.  If someone decided dogs and cats had to be taught to read, would it really be fair to blame the teachers if they just couldn&rsquo;t accomplish the mission?</p>
<p>Old sayings are famous because they&rsquo;re true, and &#8220;you can&rsquo;t make a silk purse from a sow&rsquo;s ear&#8221; comes to mind right now.</p>

<p>I graduated 6th grade in 1969 from a school that was built in 1911 with a new addition added in 1919.  40 ft ceilings.  The kind where the teacher using a big pole to open the upper sash.  Incandesent lites white globes) hanging from chains.  Actual slate blackboards.  Cloak rooms.  Coal fired steam heat.  No lunch room - we brought ours.  Libarian came once a week, as did the art teacher and the music teacher.  Those classes were held in the basement.  The 5th grade teacher was also principal.  My Uncle, brother and sister went as well.  Sister attended in the late 70s/early 80s.  We are all successful.  No carpets, just hardwood floors.  But we can read and write.  Just can not type well!</p>

		<p>As long as the discredited twin theories of egalitarianism and environmentalism from the likes of Gould, Kamin, Lewontin and Rose are the ONLY accepted dogmas (IQ is a product of one&rsquo;s environment and not heritable), and Rushton and Lynn are silenced, the reductio ad absurdum is going to be anything BUT obvious racial differences in IQ.</p>
<p>Demanding that everyone, without question, accept the premise that all races have the same potential for achievement is as futile as declaring that The Earth is Flat in the face of overwhelming, hard scientific proof that it is not.  How many billions have been squandered trying to find and redress the red herring that black failure is due to environmental causes (poverty, poor schools, White Racism)?</p>
<p>For over 70 years, despite dramatically improved standards of living for blacks, the IQ gap between blacks and Whites has not changed.  The same gap that existed in the 1910s still exists today in the 2000s  &mdash;  blacks score about 15 to 20 points lower than Whites on every measure of IQ.</p>
<p>Of course, maintaining the &#8216;no proof that IQ is inherited&rsquo; lie has become a lucrative industry for the egalitarians and it is in their best interest to ignore hard scientific evidence and silence and threaten Galileo types by calling them &#8216;racists&rsquo; or &#8216;Nazis.&rsquo; </p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve stated here before:  I believe that it will soon be Hate Speech to state that blacks have a lower IQ than Whites  &mdash;  Hate Speech punishable by hard prison time and loss of career.  </p>
<p>And so the lie continues</p>

		<p>The problem begins at home. Many of these children have mothers and &#8220;fathers&#8221; who are uneducated themselves. They have no means of helping their children with their homework or even to encourage their children to study. Top students are often mocked by their peers and thus become like them. Parents who encourage their kids to learn can help them succeed. A good example of this is the Dr Ben Carson story. Carson came from Chicago and had a mother that was illterate and worked as domestic. She had her kids write a book report every week. Ben became a doctor and his brother became an engineer.</p>

		<p>Why use two words when one will do? Below basic means failing. I suggest those responsible for education in Detroit should develop a Plan B to deal with the consequences of failing to go along with whatever Plan A they come up with to improve the education. These results show the whole city is failing. What is to become of this generation of blacks? They will also be producing the next generation of blacks who will be disadvantaged right from the start and thus more prone to failing. A failing city with at least a few coming generations of failures needs a Plan B in the event that education doesn&rsquo;t improve.  </p>

		<p>Nowhere in the article states the racial breakdown of the Detroit schools. I would assume that there is a tiny percentage of poor white/aisan kids that bring the scores up to even that dismal level. By reading the article if we did not know better one would assume that it was just a normal school system in just another big city.  Thats our media&hellip;&hellip;<br>
  I, like some of the other posters have hinted at just can see no way for the USA to remain as a 1st world power for long when our children dont get an equal education with other world economic powers. In 20-30ish years, after these kids and the rest of the blacks who have been given free college diplomas even though they are actually at about a 7th grade level, and when only due to being black with a degree they are running the government and a lot of the politically correct corporate entities in even a greater masse than they are now, the USA just wont remain as a superpower. And if we do,,,, what type of battles will we fight,, saving the blacks in africa from exploitation by aisans or something like that. Bet we wont save europe again. <br>
   But its our fault because the whites are the only race that fights for all exept ourselves. We are giving away  the best superpower on earth. So did the Romans.   Kingfish          </p>

		<p>The big push in the Education Departments all over is methodology, which is seen as the &#8220;silver bullet&#8221; nowadays to bring up low test scores for Hispanic and Black students in the United States. </p>
<p>What this means is that teachers are being buried under more and more requirements for detailed lesson plans, differentiation and data gathering which is getting to be humanly impossible to do, assuming one wants some kind of a private life and at least six hours of sleep.</p>
<p>At the same time, the reality of high numbers of students who appear with I.Q. levels in the seventies and eighties, along with behavior issues in too many cases, is not taken into account. So from the teachers&rsquo; point of view, working in heavily minority schools is becoming like trying to survive a &#8220;meat grinder&#8221; in terms of the kind of impossible demands being put on them.</p>
<p>While Detroit public schools apparently are worse than most large cities, the false lessons being learned by the educational ghurus is the same all over the country, and the inevitable lack of significant results, coming from toying with techniques and programs, will not change the denial about the realities of differences in inherited I.Q. among varying ethnic groups which is the core of the problem. </p>

<p>Bon here, not QD (although I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll be happy to give you the research as well):</p>
<p>Professor Rushton writes in Race, Evolution and Behavior:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Black babies spend the least time in the womb. In America, 51% of Black children have been born by week 39 of pregnancy compared with 33% of White children&hellip;.These Black babies are not born premature. They are born sooner, but biologically they are more mature. </p>
<p>The faster pace of growth among Blacks goes on through childhood. Black babies have greater muscular strength and can reach for objects better. Their neck muscles are often so developed that they can lift their heads up when they are only nine hours old. In a matter of days they can turn themselves over.  Black children sit, crawl, walk, and put on their own clothes earlier than Whites. The findings are measured by such tests as Bayley&rsquo;s Scales of Mental and Motor Development and the Cambridge Neonatal Scales. X-rays show bones grow faster in Black children than in White children. Brain wave patterns develop faster in Black than in White newborns.  Blacks have faster dental development than Whites&hellip;..Blacks reach sexual maturity sooner than Whites. This is true for things like age at first menstruation, first sexual experience, and first pregnancy&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I have heard the same old tired story that blacks don&rsquo;t do well because of racism and we need to have programs of all kinds to help them since I was a child, and I&rsquo;ll be 60 in February.</p>
<p>OK, so we&rsquo;ve had the programs   &mdash;   and what has been the result?</p>
<p>Things have only gotten worse with each passing year.</p>
<p>It seems to me when you tell kids, &#8220;Hey, you&rsquo;re not doing anything wrong   &mdash;   there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with you   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s *other people* who are holding you down,&#8221; what happens to their motivation to improve themselves, which isn&rsquo;t strong in most kids anyway?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care per se   &mdash;   if you told me every black person in the world was a great success or a total failure, I couldn&rsquo;t care less, either way   &mdash;   but what I do care about is when people do the same stupid, misguided thing over and over again, expecting different results.</p>
<p>What I do care about is when people hold onto their cherished beliefs, in the face of all evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>*That&rsquo;s* what makes me wonder about this world of ours, and makes me despair that things will ever improve.</p>

		<p>Bon:</p>
<p>I would have quoted Rushton as well.</p>
<p>Just to add to what you said, Rushton seems to think that the maturity rate differences between human races and between humans in general and other animals has to do with the r-K life history spectrum.  If you&rsquo;re a K strategist like humans versus rabbits, or whites versus blacks, then you don&rsquo;t need to mature and reproduce as quickly, or as often.  But if you&rsquo;re a relative r-strategist, like a rabbit vs a human or a black vs a white, then in order to reproduce more, you have to mature more rapidly.</p>
<p>Someone I know made the point to me most cogently like this:  A six month old dog can reproduce.  Therefore, a six month old dog is more mature relative to a dog&rsquo;s life cycle than a six month old human is to a human life cycle.  While the r-K differences among human races are very slight compared to the same between humans and, e.g. mosquitos, they are fairly dramatic within the universe of humans.  Us whites, adapted to our own relative K-strategy, seemed to be shocked at the relative r-strategy of blacks, and unless we can accept racial differences, which most people can&rsquo;t, we dream up stupid explanations and come up with stupid solutions to solve the &#8220;problem,&#8221; which isn&rsquo;t really a problem.  It&rsquo;s liberal whites thinking that blacks are nothing more than white people with a dark tan.</p>

		<p>You think Detroit is bad.</p>
<p>Here in St. Louis, there&rsquo;s a suburb called Wellston, which is just about 100% black.</p>
<p>Well, Wellston has been in the news lately.</p>
<p>The Missouri State Board of Education has just put an end to the Wellston School District, due to their test scores.</p>
<p>The kids of Detroit are academic geniuses compared to the kids of Wellston:</p>
<p>&#8221; &hellip; last year, just 12 percent of Wellston&rsquo;s students passed the state&rsquo;s communication arts tests, and just 5 percent passed math tests.&#8221;</p>
<p>The big joke here is the state is going to merge Wellston with another black district called Normandy.  Political correctness dictates it has to be done that way, but really, what white district wants them?</p>
<p>The other district is *still* worse than Detroit:  &#8220;24 percent of Normandy&rsquo;s students passed state English tests; nearly 15 percent math.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Listen, I&rsquo;m a teacher in a big minority-majority school district.  Save for a very few, the OVERWHELMING majority of the high school students I deal with cannot do even fifth grade work.  I know some of it is environmental and cultural, but sometimes I&rsquo;m at a loss to explain the complete cognitive disfunction of so, so very many.</p>
<p>The new educational fads, that have been going on for about five to eight years to &#8220;turn around the schools&#8221; for them are as follows:</p>
<p>Differentiation: putting retarded kids, behavior problem thugs, average kids and smart kids together in a room and teaching to each &#8220;ability&#8221; level in slightly different ways.  The idea is that the slow and problem kids won&rsquo;t feel stupid by being in a lower level class, and also the smart kids will set a good example for the dumb ones.  What happens, though, is that the few smart kids are picked on, made fun of and are forced by the teachers to tutor and help the retards all the time.  Strange thing, however, is that the slow &#8220;learners&#8221; never really improve.</p>
<p>Project Based Learning:  I am not joking - this is grouping the kids all the time (by mixed &#8220;ability&#8221; levels) and having the kids create some poorly-produced poster board project or something similar with pictures and text cut from the internet.  Everyone says, &#8220;Oh, look at how colorful and nice it is!&#8221;  To accomodate the really dumb kids, there are positions such as time keeper, picture gatherer, data gatherer. etc&hellip;  Basically, the few bright kids do all the work while the majority bad kids throw pencils around the room and draw on each other&rsquo;s arms.  I am not kidding about this.  This is what passes for high school work these days.</p>
<p>Social Justice:  You have heard a lot about this.  Basically, it is a program of total indoctrination.  I am not kidding.  Social justice is &#8220;integrated&#8221; in as many subjects as possible, and the basic message is: whites are bad, non-whites are all oppressed, all the time, and any lack of progress is due to the &#8220;structural inequalities&#8221; inherent in &#8220;the system.&#8221;  Social justice demands that oppressed minorities rise up and demand change, without having to actually transform themselves to make that change.  &#8220;It&rsquo;s all whitey&rsquo;s fault that I have so little, so give me what you got for free.&#8221;  </p>
<p>As a side note, in the case of Latinos, I have always wondered, what &#8220;structural inequaliy&#8221; in say Delaware or Michigan or South Carolina worked against them in 1960 or 1970 or even 1980?  There weren&rsquo;t any Latinos in those and many other places back then!  As for blacks, who are now moving all over white America where blacks have never been before, how have the people of Idaho or Minnesota or Vermont wronged you?</p>
<p>Many, many teachers, especially those over 30, do not like any of the educational &#8220;reforms&#8221; enumerated above.  But we have seen too many good teachers raked over hot coals and fired by ideological administrators, supported by the example of the 22-year-old somethings who are fresh out of the new indoctrination centers, otherwise known as teacher&rsquo;s colleges. </p>
<p>The &#8220;newbies&#8221; as we call them, often have next to no content knowledge for their subjects.  They keep the kids busy with social justice, project-based learning and pass everyone no matter how little they learn or do to show that differentiation is &#8220;working.&#8221;  Of course, national tests give the lie to state tests, which is an entirely different level of corruption and data manipulation.</p>
<p>I could go on and on, but the point is, do not, I repeat, do not send your kids to any school that subscribes to the 3 fads I outlined above.  Your kids will learn nothing, nothing at all, except to hate whitey.</p>

<p>Jay:</p>
<p>You have succinctly and superbly described the educational gulag exactly as it stands today.  It is indeed the smart kids who are left behind  &mdash;  all educational expenses are directed toward the impossible task of &#8216;raising the achievement level&rsquo; of the left-half of the Bell Curve.  I believe at this point the government knows that these efforts are futile  &mdash;  how can they not in the face of overwhelming empirical evidence?</p>
<p>Students are being taught to be drones of the state, not to think for themselves  &mdash;  smart kids are marginalized and dumbed down, dumb kids turned into unquestioning idiots beholden to pat Marxist slogans.  I&rsquo;ve heard rumors that the fluoride added to the municipal water supply is a government ploy to further idiocize the public as fluoride collects in the brain causing damage. </p>
<p>And as you describe, new teachers coming out of ed schools are woefully lacking in knowledge  &mdash;  especially basic writing, reading, speaking and numerical skills.  None of them would pass the old NTE (National Teachers&rsquo; Exam)  &mdash;  an extremely useful test that measured a prospective teacher&rsquo;s level of knowledge in his content area.  The test was eliminated as non-Whites could not pass it, claiming that it was racist of course.</p>
<p>Theses new drones disguised as teachers are, however, filled with Marxist clap trap and noxious notions of so-called Social Justice  &mdash;  which means confiscating &#8216;ill-gotten&rsquo; gains from the rich to hand to the oppressed poor.  One of their favorite slogans is &#8216;Tax the Rich!&rsquo;  Rich meaning anyone White.</p>
<p>Their heroes are che, mao, obama and lately hugo chavez and they worship them as if they were g-ds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve stated here many times:  This is the indoctrination your children receive from low IQ&rsquo;d drones known as &#8216;teachers&rsquo;.  &#8216;Teaching&rsquo; now consists of a mandated script that teachers must read and from which the are forbidden to deviate (Open Court being one example).  Textbooks are written by socialists and are not to be questioned.</p>
<p>Get your kids out of the government schools, do it now,  and don&rsquo;t look back.</p>
<p>You can bet those who promote odious ideas of egalitarianism as being best for your children do not send their precious children to these indoctrination centers.  </p>

		<p>Blacks have no shame. Just the insistence that blacks need to sit next to whites in order to learn is preposterous on its face. <br>
The whole integration argument falls flat on its face due to the fact that blacks will not learn. Learning is considered to be &ldquo;acting white&rdquo; and is routinely discouraged by blacks themselves. A black that wants to learn will be castigated and ridiculed by his &ldquo;peers&rdquo;.<br>
Black &ldquo;role models&rdquo; in the predominantly black public schools do seem to be doing much to foster &ldquo;self-esteem&rdquo; in their charges. However, learning is not part of the equation.<br>
The few remaining whites and asians are needed to help boost the dismal test scores.<br>

<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine that access to universities and other tracks for higher paying jobs in society required that one&rsquo;s sprinting speed in the 100 yard dash were 11 seconds or below. Due to this, it has been found that in a school with 100 blacks and 100 whites, the percentage of blacks who can meet this level of sprinting is significantly higher. Thus white students are not able to take advantage of higher education to the extent black students can.</p>
<p>But the whites, backed up by those who control society, complain that due to poor coaching, lack of decent track facilities in their schools, and not enough exposure to black students in the athletic programs, are deprived of equal opportunities to achieve this 11 second threshhold.</p>
<p>The Physical Education departments of major universities, and the school systems all over, now have emphasized special coaching techniques to teach whites how to get off the starting blocks faster, what diet and weight program to use to build themselves up, and all of this is part of the &#8220;No white sprinter left behind law&#8221; mandated by the Athletic Department of the Federal Government. Athletic Departments of school systems are under tremendous pressure to lower the number of seconds that white athletes take in sprinting the 100 yards to the tape, and those districts who don&rsquo;t meet the requirements for the standards are punished and individual athletic departments in schools are closed down with all those coaching in them fired.</p>
<p>Despite all these efforts, only minimal results are achieved as far as lowering average sprint speeds for white athletes, and a national outcry is raised. No one - except for heretics - can raise the possibility that maybe there is a genetic basis for why, on average, blacks have faster sprint speeds than whites, so that all this hand wringing and soul searching to find the &#8220;silver bullets&#8221; which will allow average white sprint speeds to equal average black sprint speeds is a costly exercise in futility.</p>

		<p>I was always brought up under the maxim, &#8220;Your parents are your first teachers&#8221;. That&rsquo;s so true given you spend more time at home than you do at school, and that your parents help shape your values.</p>
<p>Detroit has tossed those assumptions aside, putting the blame squarely on the teacher&rsquo;s union, and other adults. This is reminiscent of the articles on Amren highlighting the slow death of Detroit. The comments on those articles blamed the United Auto Workers - not the Bantus-for the destruction of the city.</p>
<p>Do you see what is happening here? You have liberals in a liberal city, turning against two large labor unions, blaming THEM for the destruction of Detroit. And all along I hought that liberals loved unions, like Romeo and Juliet loved each other. Love of labor unions is a hallmark of liberalism, but that cloth is beginning to get frayed.</p>
<p>Still, nothing will happen. The unions will pour money into the coffers of the politicians, while Bobb goes hat in hand to Obama, saying Detroit&rsquo;s schools need more money, citing the test scores as a reason why.<br>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t get me started on all the drivel that passes for &#8220;Professional Development&#8221; for teachers these days!  In one session, I am not making this up, teachers sat in two long rows of chairs facing each other.  We had to tell our best and worst moments to the one facing us and then do a &#8220;share out&#8221; of the other to the group.  On another day, we wrote down our feelings on different self-esteem scenarios on little cut out construction paper leaves and exchanged them and did a share out.  On yet another day, we were randomly assigned partners to tell our life stories to, and then - you guessed it - another group share out.  </p>
<p>These corporate &#8220;team building&#8221; activities are so innane, all but the most indoctrinated teachers now look upon them with dread.  There are, unfortunately, some very, very needy, emotionally lonely young female teachers out there who literally eat this stuff up and get all teary-eyed and such during these sessions.  (No offense to the ladies, as more experienced and mature women see through this garbage.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the whole self-esteem, everybody wins culture is now percolating up though the ranks as the younger people raised on this stuff now move into where we were 15-20 years ago.</p>
<p>Most administrators I&rsquo;ve seen recently awarded such positions are minorities of the affirmative action variety, and they are generally so incompetent that a staff of wonderful teachers can make little headway.  These &#8220;admins&#8221; harass the best teachers out of the school because they feel threatened by their greater intelligence, and they replace them with teachers who look like them, and who know next to nothing about their subjects, oh but they do great posterboard projects where &#8220;collaboration&#8221; helps everyone to be a winner&hellip;</p>
