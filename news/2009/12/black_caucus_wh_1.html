<h1><a href="https://online.wsj.com/article/SB125977829100173181.html?mod=rss_US_News">Black Caucus, White House Rift Widens</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Damian Paletta, Wall Street Journal, December 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The rift over economic policy between the Obama administration and the Congressional Black Caucus appeared to widen on Wednesday, when a meeting between several lawmakers and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel ended without an agreement and the lawmakers refused to attend a morning committee vote to overhaul financial rules.</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s effort to block a vote on the financial regulations could have derailed a major White House priority. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D., Mass.) narrowly managed to pass the bill without the panel&rsquo;s 10 Congressional Black Caucus members.</p>
<p>Mr. Frank said he spoke Tuesday evening with Mr. Emanuel and Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.), who has been leading talks for the CBC, and wasn&rsquo;t sure whether a deal could be worked out by Wednesday morning. When none of the CBC members showed up for the vote, it became clear a deal never materialized.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Republicans came just four votes short of blocking the financial overhaul measure, which would give the government the power to take over and break up faltering financial companies. If it became clear Rep. Frank didn&rsquo;t have the votes, he could have pulled the bill at the last second and waited until he had the votes. If the CBC members had shown up and voted against the bill, they likely could have killed it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Frank&rsquo;s ability to pass the bill without any CBC support could cost the CBC leverage as it negotiates with the White House. Another issue clouding their negotiations is that many officials aren&rsquo;t even sure what exactly it is CBC members want the White House to offer them.</p>
<p>Some Capitol Hill aides said CBC members have argued that minority-owned institutions should be allowed to participate in more government programs. Others have said there is frustration that the White House isn&rsquo;t doing more to reverse unemployment.</p>

		<p>There is a bit of&hellip;er, black comedy in all this. Just proving that NO ONE can make single-minded American blacks happy(in or out of Govt.), even the mullato messiah cannot do enough to silence the perpetual strains of black grousing! Some things will obviously NEVER change. And why would they change, after all, this racial shakedown has been very, very lucrative has it not?  </p>

<p>But he&rsquo;s going to hold a &#8220;jobs summit&#8221; tomorrow, flanked by H-1B loving tech companies, union leaders of non-whites and non-manufacturing/industry, and academia.  Guaranteeing that no real jobs will be created.</p>

<p>What these blacks want from a black president is his complete concentration on privileges and benefits for blacks at the exclusion of all else.</p>
<p>They regard any matter not a black matter as insignificant and a waste of time and money.</p>
<p>Their one overriding desire is to somehow raise all blacks up to a high middle-class level with selective blacks also in more positions of power and prestige.  That they&rsquo;re not qualified for anything beyond menial work doesn&rsquo;t matter to them at all.  They don&rsquo;t mind pretending they&rsquo;re qualified, as they have been doing for decades now.</p>
<p>They want to have as many authors; as many scientists; as many scholars, and all other learned positions as whites do, and their way of acquiring these positions and accomplishments is to just simply inject blacks where they want them.</p>
<p>If they aren&rsquo;t smart enough to write books, then they will get white ghost writers and pretend a black wrote it, as they did with Van Jones and the multi-millionaire dunce at Black Entertainment Network.  If a black doesn&rsquo;t have the intellect to have acquired a basic knowledge of a particular field that he  is in charge of then he must have advisors to run things behind the scenes.</p>
<p>I realize this all sounds a bit far-fetched, but I believe every word of it absolutely.  These people have to be cared for like children, but, at the same time, we must all pretend they are equal in everything and further pretend the only reasons they do not have parity with whites intellectually and economically is strictly due to white oppression and racism.</p>
<p>That they are disappointed with Obama, after all the manipulations he is involved with to promote all things that will help blacks, isn&rsquo;t surprising at all.  In fact I expected it.  To measure up to their expectations he must wave a magic wand and make them all black kings and queens.</p>
<p>Remember the Amren article where the blacks in Africa thought that if they built concrete runways that was all that would be necessary to do in order to make them an economic power, because they knew from past experiences that white men land planes on runways and they have briefcases full of money?  Well, I have to admit the Black Caucus might not be quite that dense, but that certainly doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re smart or worldly.  </p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m painting a pretty dark picture here of blacks in general, but in no way do I think it is inaccurate.</p>

		<p>Believe me, any rifts between the CBC and the White House are fleeting and temporary.<br>
&#8216;Reparations&rsquo; are firmly on the agenda and will remain so as long as the white vote is distributed between the Republicans and the Democrats.<br>
We need a third party candidate and, when we get one, we shouldn&rsquo;t be stymied by his lack of media coverage. All we need is the internet.</p>

		<p>Yeah, once blacks get one of their own in high office, they think everything has to go their way. They have no concept of how things work. I saw this up close when the world class moron, David Dinkins, became mayor of NYC. The blacks went stark raving mad. So much so that they had a riot that Dinkins ordered the police to stand aside and allow to proceed. A Jewish man was stabbed to death in it, thus costing Dinkins his reelection. Something along those lines will probably happen with Obama as well.</p>
<p>As the actress, Bette Davis famously said, &#8220;fasten your seatbelts, we&rsquo;re in for a bumpy ride.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Members of the CBC, like all blacks, believe once they seize power, they should use it ruthlessly to champion black causes and crush their (white) enemies.</p>
<p>Obama has to play it cool with the CBC. He knows he can&rsquo;t push a &#8216;black agenda&rsquo; otherwise he would be seen as only a &#8216;black president&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If Obama has any hope of being a two-term president, he can&rsquo;t be seen as siding with blacks on exclusively black issues otherwise he would prove his critics right.</p>
<p>In a second term, he might be more open to a black agenda.</p>

<p>Ranger responds:</p>

<p>I would only add this to your fine post:  The CBC wants REVENGE on White America and they believe it is should be obama&rsquo;s main directive  &mdash;  THIS is their opportunity to openly punish Whites without mercy and to confiscate ALL White wealth and property (which they believe rightly belongs to them) and hand it over to blacks.  </p>
<p>Blacks of this ilk believe America was entirely built &#8216;on the backs of blacks&rsquo;, blacks invented everything only to have it stolen from them and claimed by Whites, blacks are poor because Whites confiscated all black wealth, White crime against blacks is out of control, innocent blacks are racially profiled and &#8216;swept&rsquo; unjustly into prisons by racist police and wrongly convicted by a racist court system.  They believe all Whites to be Nazi racists who spend each and every day carefully planning how to keep blacks down.</p>
<p>After all, this is what they learn in the educational-industrial complex and from the media every day.</p>

<p>For those of us who follow what is going on in the rainbow country of South Africa this is exactly how things are being run, ignorant black figureheads paired with low payed whites who are happy to have any job at all anymore who do all the work. Clint Eastwood should be ashamed of making the film, &#8220;Invictus&#8221; that glorifies Nelson Mandela and South Africa.  I wonder if Clint will show us the farm murders and rapes.  I wonder if he will show the devolution of what was once a civilized western nation?</p>

		<p>I tend to think that this supposed &#8220;frustration&#8221; that the CBC or any of its individual members have with President Obama is all a show.</p>
<p>In 1996, strategist Dick Morris had President Clinton &#8220;triangulate&#8221; (or, pretend to), by having him distance himself (i.e. pretend to) from the left wing of his own party while at the same time opposing the right wing.  The whole thing was a way to portray Clinton as a &#8220;third way&#8221; politician, when he really wasn&rsquo;t.  Clinton signed &#8220;welfare reform,&#8221; but the dirty little secret was that after it was signed in 1996, SSI was the fastest growing line item in the Federal budget between then and 9/11   &mdash;   the former AFDC/TANF clients switched to SSI based on the pretense that their children were &#8220;retarded,&#8221; all the while they tell us there&rsquo;s no such thing as IQ much less racial differences therein.</p>
<p>The CBC is pretending to be frustrated with Obama because they&rsquo;re doing the opposite of Clinton triangulation   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re casting the message that Obama is some kind of moderate, and they don&rsquo;t like it.  That&rsquo;s what some people will take away.</p>

		<p>The current economic crisis began in many experts&rsquo; view because the housing subsidy agencies like Fannie Mae, run by blacks under Clinton, made loans available to black deadbeats.  Run economic policy to suit black racial agendas and you will debase the currency and wreck the workings of free markets. But the idea you pull yourself up by living in a small home or apartment just doesn&rsquo;t cut it with them. Obama eventually will cave to the blackmail of these economic illiterates and Marxist wannabes.</p>
