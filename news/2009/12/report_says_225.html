<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-latinamerica/20091222/CB.Haiti.Child.Slaves/">Report Says 225,000 Haiti Children Work As Slaves</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Evens Sanon and Jonathan M. Katz, Comcast News, December 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Poverty has forced at least 225,000 children in Haiti&rsquo;s cities into slavery as unpaid household servants, far more than previously thought, a report said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Pan American Development Foundation&rsquo;s report also said some of those children  &mdash;  mostly young girls  &mdash;  suffer sexual, psychological and physical abuse while toiling in extreme hardship.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Young servants are known as &#8220;restavek&#8221;  &mdash;  Haitian Creole for &#8220;stays with&#8221;  &mdash;  and their plight is both widely known and a source of great shame in the Caribbean nation that was founded by a slave revolt more than 200 years ago.</p>
<p>Researchers said the practice is so common that almost half of 257 children interviewed in the sprawling Port-au-Prince shantytown of Cite Soleil were household slaves.</p>
<p>Most are sent by parents who cannot afford to care for them to families just slightly better off. Researchers found 11 percent of families that have a restavek have sent their own children into domestic servitude elsewhere.</p>
<p>Despite growing attention to the problem, researchers said their sources were unaware of any prosecutions of cases involving trafficking children or using them as unpaid servants in this deeply poor nation of more than 9 million people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new report used a broader counting system to include children related to household owners but still living in servitude, such as nieces or cousins, and as well as &#8220;boarders&#8221; living temporarily with another family but are still forced to provide labor.</p>

		<p>This story has a different ending than for the kids in Morgantown and Pittsburg. Often, at the age of 15, the so called relative has to begin paying the child to continue to work for them per Haitian law. As a result, many of them are put out with no money and no place to go.</p>

		<p>There is, of course, nothing wrong with this. Only when whites hold slaves is it the greatest evil ever to infect the planet. It doesn&rsquo;t matter at all if other peoples hold slaves. Right? We so rarely ever hear about non-white slaveholders after all.</p>

		<p>In two generations, Haiti has gone from an island of 3 million souls to 9 million.  The average woman will bear 4.86 children in her lifetime. The median age has dropped to 18. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re witnessing another Easter Island unfold in our lifetime.  When faced with mass starvation, they will continue to breed with their hands extended for charity, expecting us to feed them or take them in.   </p>

		<p>If you look at this structurally, this begins with poor &#8216;families&rsquo; selling to a slightly higher income family, who then sell to the next income bracket, etc. <br>
This is a classic economic bubble - akin to Holland&rsquo;s tulips and John Law&rsquo;s Mississippi Bubble. There is no there there. These are house slaves for lazy bastards, not slaves for economic production - as far as has been described in the article. Therefore, this does follow the economic bubble schema.<br>
The end result is a cultural re-institutionalization of slavery which we are witnessing right now.<br>
Ironic, eh Haiti?</p>

		<p>I am sure an Alfred Sharpton or a Jesse Jackson or a Danny Glover reading this article would say: </p>
<p>&#8220;well, they are really not slaves in the sense of the word as it meant in the Old South, so the situation is NOT that bad!!&#8221;</p>
<p>OR.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow, OUR people would not treat OUR OWN people in that way!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Modern slavery, what they call it, is almost exclusively so the enslavement of dark skinned folks by other dark skinned folks.</p>

<p>Haiti children!! is that what the government is calling White taxpaying slaves now. I don&rsquo;t care about no Haitian children because the next thing we know, our own gubmint will have them all up here on some sort of welfare in some White city.</p>

		<p>Should we rename this emerging African nation HATEY instead of Haiti? Again, Haiti is on one half of an Island and Dominican Republic is on the OTHER half but what is the difference?? black rule in Haiti makes it a Zimbabwe in the Western hemisphere.</p>

<p>This is so true. Most people think of slavery as something that was committed only by Whites years ago. The truth is, the practice is alive and well today in some parts of the world. Of course since the slaveholders aren&rsquo;t White, little is said. I&rsquo;ve no doubt that if Swedes or some other Whites were having slaves, it would be all over the news every night and there would be candlelight vigils and marches in the streets.<br>

		<p>A nation founded 200 years ago by a slave revolt, huh? Well, we can see that turned out swell. In 200 years the victorious ex-slaves managed to make things about, oh, 200 times worse for the population. Quite an accomplishment. Might even rival the accomplishments of their bros in Africa, who managed to turn prospering Rhodesia and South Africa into hellholes after their own victories over the white oppressor, in just a few short decades. And by the looks of things, this will soon be coming to us here in the good ol&rsquo; USA!</p>

		<p>I once read that Haiti was originally the jewel of the Caribbean. Of course that was likely a matter of percepction * Then the wave of egalitarianism hit and the commoners (Allegedly slaughtered the ruling class. The blacks slaughtered the whites/SA/Rhodesia-style&hellip; Since then I don&rsquo;t think its the jewel of the Caribbean in anyone&rsquo;s eyes despite massive efforts on the part of whites several times. Do we see a pattern here ?</p>
