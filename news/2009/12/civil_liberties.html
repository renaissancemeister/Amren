<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/us/09aclu.html">Civil Liberties Group Loses $20 Million Donor</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephanie Strom, New York Times, December 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A longtime anonymous donor to the American Civil Liberties Union has withdrawn his annual gift of more than $20 million, punching a 25 percent hole in its annual operating budget and forcing cutbacks in operations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A.C.L.U. board members, who insisted on anonymity because the loss of the gift was reported in an executive session of their meeting, identified the donor as David Gelbaum, who made a fortune as a hedge fund manager and is now better known as a major investor in clean technology.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Gelbaum took a rare turn in the spotlight earlier this decade when environmental activists said he was behind the Sierra Club&rsquo;s decision to adopt a neutral stance on immigration. Some people believe immigration has aggravated environmental problems.</p>
<p>He had given the organization a total of $101.5 million, according to The Los Angeles Times, which wrote what is perhaps the only major profile of him, in 2004. In the article, he is quoted as saying that he told Carl Pope, the Sierra Club&rsquo;s executive director, in 1994 or 1995 &#8220;that if they ever came out anti-immigration, they would never get a dollar from me.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is fascinating to say the least. </p>
<p>It begs the question, what is David Gelbaum&rsquo;s agenda? (and others with similar patterns of investment and perceived philanthropy which are incongruent with their stance on immigration.)</p>
<p>A cynical observer might say being pro-immigration benefits elite investors who benefit from the pie growing bigger. Donating to an environmental cause gives one political currency with the left-wing, moral bragging rights attached to your name, and a nice tax write-off at end year.</p>

		<p>The Sierra Club is pathetic as an example of an environmental organization. There is no POSSIBLE WAY, that you can have environmental concerns, and allow massive immigration, whether it&rsquo;s legal or illegal. Just ask China or India, two nations with huge population and both environmentally damaged to the hilt. In fact, if you ARE an environmentalist you won&rsquo;t support the Sierra Club, no post cards, trinkets, or anything else they sell.</p>

		<p>What does Mr. Gelbaum do for a living?  I get the feeling that it&rsquo;s something like real estate development, a field where his xenophilia isn&rsquo;t just an academic exercise for him, but something which directly affects his pocketbook.  Hint:  Mass immigration has an upward pressure on real estate values, especially in land-limited places like California.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why anyone would be against preserving this beautiful land - or our beautiful earth.  Except perhaps a few super-rich elitists who are sick with acquisition syndrome.  Are you really happy to see rain forests demolished to make toilet paper?  Ever wonder what people did before someone invented it?  Ever wonder about much at all?</p>
<p>What few don&rsquo;t know is that there was a schism within the Sierra Club a while back.  The result of what happened was what usually does; the purpose of the organization is lost and lawyers and elitists take over.  The Sierra Club was formerly AGAINST illegal immigration because of the damage smugglers and squatters were perpetrating in our forests and parks. Now it&rsquo;s neutral.  They&rsquo;ve been neutered.  That sounds like a lot of whites and those who would advocate for whites. </p>
<p>But as some have pointed out, in the end money talks and ideals - among other things - walks.  Looks like it happened to the BNP too.  Perhaps these organizations think it is better to be compromized than to be exterminated.  I can see the white realist movement in 50 years - as things are going, headed by people who can only claim half or less of authentic white genetics.  Think about it.</p>

<p>Money silences the main goal of an environmental protection group  &mdash;  protection of the environment.  The Sierra Club is a joke  &mdash;  they fight to prevent a border fence from being built and turn a blind eye to the untold destruction of fragile desert lands due to massive illegal immigration:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;San Diego Chapter activists are fighting an effort to build second and third fences along the 3.5-mile section of the border nearest the Pacific Ocean&hellip;the Club&hellip;sued to halt the project, and the California Coastal Commission rejected the plan&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yevjm92" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yevjm92</a></p>
<p>Yet in California, the hypocritical Sierra Club comes out swinging against any developer that deigns to touch an oak tree, defends a 1/2 inch fish&rsquo;s rights to water over people, files lawsuits to protect wetlands and other environmentally sensitive areas.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile in the extremely fragile desert that borders mexico:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;wildfires caused by immigrants smoking cigarettes or building fires to warm themselves at night have destroyed about 20% of the riparian vegetation along the San Pedro River in Cochise County. Plastic water bottles, food wrappers, toilet paper and human feces cover large areas where fences have been cut for the passage of human coyotes&hellip;. off-road vehicles of alien smugglers often go down steep embankments and motor oil and fuel leaks into streams and endangered species habitat. </p>
<p>[In] Coronado National Memorial&hellip;.Coronado National Memorial in southeastern Arizona, a unit of the National Park System consisting of 4,750 acres of oak woodland and grassland with 3.5 miles bordering Mexico&hellip;.Vegetation is trampled to such an extent that steep hillsides have been eroded and much ground laid bare-with litter widespread-like discarded clothing, blankets, food containers, toilet paper and human excrement&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t try to stop illegal immigrant from invading your private property!  You have no right to do this and your government will not help you:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Attempts to detain immigrants on your property, while you wait for the Border Patrol, are often investigated by the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department to see if any law has been broken. Then the Mexican Consulate must be advised so it can ensure the rights of their citizens and provide them with legal counsel if needed&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yal8to5" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yal8to5</a></p>
<p>The Sierra Club deserves to be defunded completely  &mdash;  and exposed widely for the hypocritical organization that it is.</p>

		<p>David Gelbaum, might be writing the check, but it&rsquo;s from your and my bank account. These mini dictators take tax sheltered monies and empower the same organizations that work against us. Many times this money is used like a fulcrum to pry away large chunks of the public dole from a corrupt congress. A dollars worth of lobbying can multiply 10 to 100 fold in grants, &#8220;tax targets&#8221; federal funds. </p>

		<p>6 PeeJay: The Sierra Club is the best known environmental organization, and probably the most influential.  If they tried, they could force the environmental consequences of immigration into the public eye, just as the unions could force the politicians to look at the employment consequences.  That they deliberately look away from an issue that threatens their central agenda tells me that their agenda is no longer what it was when Theodore Roosevelt was a member.  </p>

		<p>I never donate to any group that  favors immigration.  US needs moratorium.  If US had enforced laws for last 50 years I may have different opinion.  All I know is US is saturated with millions of needy ignorant NonEnglish speaking criminals and I am tired of paying for it so rich people can live and give and deny me of my peace and tranquility.  Those who want to bring immigrants (legal or illegal) need to be fully responsible for their needs just like it used to be.  Every immigrant must be sponsored so I am not taxed to death to pay for this guys wishes.  He needs to donate his money where his mouth is.   V</p>

		<p>Peejay, the Sierra Club is one of the most influential environmental organizations. It has one of the largest memberships of such groups. If it went against immigration it would attract many people who are looking for ways to help out. So yes it is important which way it sets its policy.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This family, that has sought to protect its privacy by arranging its gifts anonymously, notified us last month that due to market conditions it will be unable to make its expected sizable donations of over $20 million,&rdquo; Mr. Romero said.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I mentioned many times in earlier posts, the upside to economic difficulties is that fools like this, and the radical leftist groups he supports, are going to have to pull back and lick their wounds financially, because they just won&rsquo;t have the money to throw away for worthless causes.</p>
<p>Universities are on the chopping block, too.  Wait awhile.  Soon we will be hearing the pitiful lamentations from the academics regarding even more financial cutbacks, requiring them to drop nonsense, worthless subjects, like black and women&rsquo;s studies.</p>
<p>And the hysterical shrieking from radical feminists and black racists will fill the air.</p>

		<p>The Sierra Club is a useless fraud.  It is a waste of time and money.  When I was born, there were 10 million people in California and about that many in the surrounding Western States.  At that time, California and the West were still primarily natural   &mdash;   an ecological paradise.  Today, due to massive immigration (largely from Mexico), there are nearly 40 million people in California and also in the surrounding Western states.  The result is a giant ecological disaster.  But, not a word from the Sierra Club about the effects on the environment of importing millions and millions of Third Worlders (who care nothing about the environment).  Instead, the Sierra Club pushes useless New Age solutions such as &#8220;Put a brick in your toilet.&#8221;  or, &#8220;Eat more algae.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Under the watch of the Sierra Club, California was ruined   &mdash;   in only 60 years.  DO NOT SUPPORT THE SIERRA CLUB.  </p>

		<p>The other name of the Sierra Club is the &#8220;See a Area Develop Club&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Under their watchful eyes, much of the beauty and natural grandeur of the Western USA has been developed (housing tracts, shopping malls, freeways, sewage-treatment plants, dams, power plants, etc.), to support the millions and millions of immigrants from Mexico that the Sierra Club (excuse me, I mean the See a Area Develop Club), encourages.  </p>
<p>The Sierra Club has been the best friend of the Construction and Real Estate Industries in the Western USA.   The interesting thing is that the Mexicans, Africans, and Middle Easterners that the Sierra Club love so much, don&rsquo;t care about the environment   &mdash;   these immigrants want money, big screen TVs, and Sports Utility Vehicles.    </p>

		<p><i>There is no POSSIBLE WAY, that you can have environmental concerns, and allow massive immigration, whether it&rsquo;s legal or illegal.</i></p>
<p>This is an interesting point. A generation or two ago, the leftist position was to limit population growth, or face depletion of resources and living space. Remember the movie &#8220;Soylent Green&#8221;? The odd thing is, we are getting there today in many major American inner cities. But this state of affairs is now being encouraged by the new generation of progressives. Zero Population Growth is no longer on the table. Unrestricted immigration from the third world is now the agenda. </p>
<p>Were one to believe in conspiracies, one might, perhaps, speculate that ZPG&rsquo;s intent was to reduce the numbers of the American citizenry and then in Phase II, replace them with masses of third world immigrants. </p>

		<p>The Anti Christian Lawyers Union could make up for their shortfall by cutting out all operations that involve suing towns and states that try to enforce immigration law.  (We already know the Federal government will never enforce immigration law itself.)  But I suspect that won&rsquo;t be the method they choose to balance their budget.</p>
<p>From the article:<br>
<i>Late last year, suffering from a decline in charitable giving caused by the economic downturn as well as the loss of income from two foundations hit by the Bernard L. Madoff scandal, the A.C.L.U. pared 10 percent of its national staff, or 36 jobs, and Mr. Romero agreed to a 15 percent cut in his salary, reducing it to $302,048 this year, compared with $355,000 in the prior year.</i></p>
<p>Once again Bernie Madoff does us a favor by helping to defund the left.</p>
