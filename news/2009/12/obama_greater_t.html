<h1><a href="https://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/article868683.ece">Obama Greater Than Jesus</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>"ts," Politiken.dk, December 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>He is provocative in insisting on an outstretched hand, where others only see animosity.</p>
<p>His tangible results in the short time that he has been active  &mdash;  are few and far between. His greatest results have been created with words and speeches  &mdash;  words that remain in the consciousness of their audience and have long-term effects.</p>
<p>He comes from humble beginnings and defends the weak and vulnerable, because he can identify himself with their conditions.</p>
<p>And no we are not thinking of Jesus Christ, whose birthday has just been celebrated  &mdash;  but rather the President of the United States Barack Hussein Obama.</p>
<p>For some time now, comparisons between the two have been a tool of cynical opinion that quickly became fatigued of the rapture that Obama instilled prior to and after the presidential election last year.</p>
<p>From the start, Obama&rsquo;s critics have claimed that his supporters have idolised him as a saviour, thus attempting to dismantle the concrete hope that Obama has represented for most Americans.</p>
<p>The idea was naturally that the comparison between Jesus and Obama  &mdash;  which is something that the critics developed themselves  &mdash;  would be comical, blasphemous, or both.</p>
<p>If such a comparison were to be made, it would, of course, inevitably be to Obama&rsquo;s advantage.</p>
<p>Today, his historic Health Reform is being passed through the American Senate  &mdash;  a welfare policy breakthrough that several of his predecessors have been unable to manage.</p>
<p>Despite all the compromises, it has finally been possible to ensure something so fundamental, as the right of every American not to be financially shipwrecked when their health fails them. Add to that the biggest ever financial support package in America&rsquo;s history, a major disarmament agreement and the quickest-ever re-establishment of American reputation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have Jesus&rsquo; miracles that everyone still remembers, but which only benefitted a few. At the same time, we have the wonderful parables about his life and deeds that we know from the New Testament, but which have been interpreted so differently over the past 2000 years that it is impossible to give an unequivocal result of his work.</p>
<p>Obama is, of course, greater than Jesus  &mdash;  if we have to play that absurd Christmas game. But it is probably more meaningful to insist that with today&rsquo;s domestic triumph, that he has already assured himself a place in the history books  &mdash;  a space he has good chances of expanding considerably in coming years.</p>
<p>Without, however, ever attaining the heavens .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

		<p>John Lennon, who saw himself as some great philosopher but was in actual fact the co-writer of some catchy tunes, no more no less, once opined in a fit of revolting boasting that The Beatles were more popular than Christ. What he really meant was that he, Lennon, was some kind of messiah and that, we, the uninitiated, should hearken to the impostor from Liverpool. I seem to recall that one of the messiah&rsquo;s followers tested whether the messiah was indeed immortal.<br>

		<p>I think I know why continental European liberals love Obama so much.  It&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re jealous of American power and prosperity, and they love anyone who would bring America down.  Silvio Berlusconi, while he&rsquo;s not liberal, admitted as much, at the same time he called Obama a &#8220;well-tanned chatterbox.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jared Taylor has predicted that even if Obama gets his health care &#8220;reform&#8221; passed, no one is going to be very happy with it, and Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s predictions have been pretty much on the money up to now.</p>

		<p>Keep in mind that Hussien is being marketed as being *greater than Jesus without ever having been crucified (I think I read that he broke a nail once.)<br>
I suppose that would make him an Affirmative Action Deity, too?</p>

<p>Well, now we know exactly where the editorial board of the &ldquo;Politiken DK&rdquo; is coming from and it is to the left of Trotsky, where Stalin and Mao sit at Satan&lsquo;s hooves!</p>
<p>The mocking tone against Jesus and the vile embrace of Comrade Obama&rsquo;s genocidal &ldquo;welfare policy,&rdquo; are the first hints. However, there is more than that; it is the very idolatry of the Ruby Calf that is General Secretary Obama, while witlessly denying it, that bespeaks of the vacuous moral and spiritual degeneracy of these fecklessly Red wretches. </p>
<p>As is noted, even King Herod could not be worse in this milieu:</p>

		<p>Let us focus on the Obama of history, rather than the Obama of faith. Because, believe me, the Obama of Faith will prevail over the Obama of History. We are seeing it happen, Nobel peace-prize and all.</p>
<p>It is already necessary to de-mythologize him, and he has been president for little more than a year!</p>
<p>(In the coming future, we will be expected to adore Holy Mother Rosa, Obama as the son of equal opportunity, and ML King as the Father of Equality. The spirit of multiculturalism will enlighten every man.)</p>
<p>Actually, in all seriousness, I think there could be some parallels between Jesus and Obama, if one first accepts the premise of Neitzsche  &mdash;  that Christianity was an inversion of values, the peasant&rsquo;s way of getting back at the Romans and Greeks for not paying enough attention to them. </p>
<p>Thus, in the first century, wealth and power were seen as the route to hell, poverty and weakness were seen as God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>In the present inversion of values, which has been going on for some fifty years, Whiteness is seen as evil and exploitive, and ability and competence are seen as evil &#8220;White privilige.&#8221; </p>
<p>Obama is the liberals&rsquo; and blacks&rsquo; way of getting back at traditional White America and the Bush Abomination, regardless of all that was done for them, and the amounts of our money that have been wasted on them.</p>
<p>I think that what we might see happen with Obama and his deification could very well closely resemble events of the first century. Maybe it won&rsquo;t go as far, because of modern factors, but I think it will be interesting, and instructive. </p>

		<p>The critics this author bemoans really have not compared Obama to Jesus. Rather, they (we) have blasted his naive and foolish followers for their unquestioning worship of him. Few, if any, legitimate comparisons between Obama and Christ could really be made, if you simply read their words. </p>
<p>This writer is an imbecile, obviously. However, he/she/it does nail one thing straight on the head, correctly labeling Obamacare for what it is:</p>
<p><i>Today, his historic Health Reform is being passed through the American Senate &mdash; <b>a welfare policy</b> breakthrough that several of his predecessors have been unable to manage.</i></p>
<p>Yup. Welfare. Steal from the productive to give to the worthless. &#8216;Nuff said.</p>

<p>I note that this publication is from Denmark. How can this country print cartoons of Mohammed on the one hand, and opine that Obama is greater than Christ, on the other? Don&rsquo;t they know that Obama is a political hack from Chicago, not some divine messiah?</p>
<p>To Jerddermann:</p>
<p>Lennon was an atheist, of course, who also said, &#8220;God is an instrument by which we measure our pain&#8221;. But he might have had an epiphany later in his life. Consider:</p>
<p>He had a cat named &#8216;Jesus&#8221;, and also used to watch Pat Robertson&rsquo;s &#8220;700 Club&#8221;. Whenever the program came on, Lennon would drop to his knees and clasp his hands in prayer.</p>

		<p>To Soprano Fan, regarding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they know that Obama is a political hack from Chicago, not some divine messiah?&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
Of course they don&rsquo;t, they simply and foolishly seek &ldquo;faith&rdquo; and &ldquo;hope&rdquo; throughout their godless Marxist madness, to say nothing of &ldquo;change.&rdquo; It is quite a sickening spectacle (an abysmal freak show to be precise) but it nebulously corks the dread and emptiness in them. They graspingly need him to validate their absurd multicultural &ldquo;ideals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be honest Soprano Fan, I have seen some really mortifying and abominable things in my life, but this worship of Comrade Obama pretty much ices the cake. I never thought I would live to see a black &ldquo;president,&rdquo; let alone one that was so absurdly deified without precedent or portfolio. To even think that anyone, no matter how vile or unbalanced, could seriously compare this multicultural monstrosity to Jesus Christ is totally beyond me.</p>
<p>And before our very eyes, the &ldquo;savior&rdquo; sinks on the troubled waters he is supposed to walk on!</p>
<p>In keeping with my above video from &ldquo;Jesus Christ Superstar,&rdquo; how long will it be until the NACCP and Democrats decide to really make this inept buffoon a &ldquo;martyr&rdquo; in  their typical gutter manner? Oh, he is certainly not what they wanted, but he will do for a hopelessly haphazard &ldquo;crucifixion&rdquo; via the &ldquo;useful&rdquo; idiots who truculently can never get enough from him or anybody else in terms of nut breads and careless circuses. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t hate John Lennon. Perhaps I should but he a sharp wit and vibrant spirit I&rsquo;ll always admire and he wrote great music. I love all white people even those who are a bit deluded. It&rsquo;s no coincidence that many very artistic people are also liberals. It&rsquo;s because artists are often more emotional and liberalism is the ultimate triumph of emotion over reason and common sense. </p>
