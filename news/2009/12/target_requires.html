			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kimberly Dvorak, San Diego County Examiner, December 17, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When a Target store in Walnut Creek, California requested employees to present their legal documentation in order to keep their jobs, they were surprised to receive resignations instead of proper paperwork.</p>
<p>The Northern California store lost approximately 40 employees overnight and in place of the employees Target was presented with a legal wrangle by La Raza Centro Legal guru, Rocio Avila who is now representing the illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>A spokesperson from Target, Kate Gillen explained the employees had an opportunity to prove their eligibility in order to continue working, however most resigned without incident.</p>
<p>It seems La Raza is questioning Target&rsquo;s rational behind the move to request legal documents. It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that it is unlawful for employers and illegal immigrants to enter the workforce without proper identification and work papers.</p>
<p>However, La Raza contends Target is simply targeting illegal workers in an effort continue its practice of racial profiling. {snip}</p>

		<p>If Target asked all employees, then they&rsquo;re in the clear.  Businesses are caught in the Catch 22 between violating immigration law (knowingly hiring) and violating civil rights laws (profiling, discrimination).  E-Verify solves that.</p>

		<p>Target is a piker. I have had to provide proof of citizenship everywhere I have ever worked. I worked for Sanderson Farms Inc. and they knowingly hired illegal aliens ahead of American workers so they would not have to provide insurance.For one hundred dollars a month they sold out their country,and remember these companies utilize corporate welfare(in the form of low interest loans) that would embarass FDR. Remember the Buisness of America is business. </p>

<p>Oh, La Raza, again!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a lawyer, so I would like to get something straight, here: those people (the illegals) had no right to permanently live, or work, in the US, in the first place.</p>
<p>Target had every right to check out if the people they employed were legally allowed to work, right? So how come La Raza can come in and claim that Target are just a bunch of racists doig racial profiling?</p>
<p>Still, the nerve of those Raza people is beyond belief!</p>

		<p>&#8220;La Raza contends Target is simply targeting illegal workers&hellip; &#8220;</p>
<p>Asking for proper paper work &#8220;unfairly&#8221; discriminates against people without paperwork.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re at it: Asking you promiscous partner to get tested for HIV unfairly targets those who have HIV. Requiring that a final exam be taken and passed to recieve a passing grade unfairly targets stupid lazy kids. Requiring children in elementry school to have their sight tested unfairly targets children who will need corrective lenses.</p>
<p>Tell me, are the leaders of La Raza so unintelligent that they believe such a statement constitutes a strong argument on their part?</p>

How can you illegally, TARGET ILLEGALS?<br>
Aren&rsquo;t they ILLEGAL and therefore Subject to being Targeted?</p>

		<p>If Target sticks to its guns and doesn&rsquo;t kowtow to La Raza I&rsquo;ll shop there more often.  It looks like 40 American citizens might now be able to find jobs, at a time when unemployment is above 10%.  Only the left could object to that.<br>

		<p>If Target had some backbone, and got all their employees to prove they have the right to work in the US, then I would go out of my way to shop there. Their website has a &#8220;we grovel before the Lord of diversity&#8221; section, however, so I don&rsquo;t think there HR section is on the side of White Americans:</p>

<p>The invaders should be arrested and deported as soon as they show up in court. Then the case should be thrown out, since the plaintiffs are no longer around to testify.</p>

		<p>I briefly worked at a Target in Sacramento&hellip; worst job I ever had. If they paid better than 6.50 an hour maybe more Whites would get on board. </p>
<p>For what it is worth, every time I was ever hired I had to produce two forms of ID, or one passport. I am sure if these illegals had such then they were surely fake, purchased on the black market with stolen information. </p>

		<p>I have often wondered how it is &#8220;Progressives&#8221; can use tax ID #s and social security #s to hunt down taxes from wealth white people to collect progressive income tax but they cannot use those same numbers to check to see if those same people are legally entitled to work in the first place.  Same for feminists who go after child support and alimony.  The Democrats are not only traitors, they are also hypocrites.    </p>
