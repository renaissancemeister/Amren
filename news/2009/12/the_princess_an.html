<h1>The &#8216;Princess&rsquo; and Walt Disney</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Neal Gabler, Chicago Tribune, December 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [There] is a long-standing belief among those detractors that Walt Disney was anything but the amiable, avuncular, kind-hearted figure he appeared to be on his television program and in his promotions. The real Disney, so this version goes, was a rabid reactionary who was intemperate, crabbed and mean  &mdash;  racially and ethnically insensitive at best, a racist and anti-Semite at worst. Under his supervision, the Disney studio was inhospitable to minorities, few of whom were said to have worked there, and they were virtually verboten on the screen, except to be ridiculed.</p>
<p>How much of this portrait was the product of a smear campaign by Walt&rsquo;s enemies and how much a product of Walt&rsquo;s own unenlightened attitudes is difficult to determine. {snip}</p>
<p>Disney came by those enemies honestly when his animators staged a strike in 1941 complaining of paternalism and low wages, and Walt responded by hustling the supposed union ringleaders off the lot and firing other union members to quash their organizing. {snip}</p>
<p>Unquestionably, especially after the strike, Disney was a political conservative by way of anti-communism. He was certain that the strike was instigated by communist agents in the Screen Cartoonists Guild who were determined to sully the Disney brand  &mdash;  this after Disney had been extolled by the left for years for his collaborative enterprise and exemplary working conditions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Walt also seemed to subscribe to many of the ethnic stereotypes of his time. He could refer to Italians and blacks with unmistakable slurs of the day, according to materials at the Walt Disney Archives  &mdash;  though there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any malice in these words, just obtuseness. {snip} At home he always preached racial, religious and ethnic tolerance to his two daughters.</p>
<p>The main evidence for Walt&rsquo;s racial insensitivity, however, is &#8220;Song of the South,&#8221; his 1946 combination of live action and animation based on the Southern folk tales of Joel Chandler Harris, known as Uncle Remus, which, though set in the Reconstruction era, makes the black former slaves seem dependent upon and excessively grateful to their former owners. From any modern racial perspective, the film is cringe-inducing and it isn&rsquo;t much mitigated by the fact that Remus, played by James Baskett, is the most dignified and sympathetic figure in the movie. (Its reputation is such that to this day it is not available on DVD in this country.) Indeed, &#8220;Song of the South&#8221; seems to give credence to the idea that Walt was clueless when it came to race.</p>
<p>But the fact is that Walt anticipated these criticisms and went to great lengths to make the film as racially sensitive as he could. He hired a Jewish left-wing screenwriter, Maurice Rapf, to do a draft of the script because, as he told Rapf, &#8220;You&rsquo;re against Uncle Tomism and you&rsquo;re a radical.&#8221; Before signing Baskett, he approached the black actor, singer and leftist activist Paul Robeson to play the role of Remus and asked him to review the script. And he sent the script to a number of black notables for comment, including the actress Hattie McDaniel.</p>
<p>Yet Walt was more politically obtuse than he was racially obtuse. When the film opened, he was stunned by the firestorm of protest from African-Americans who thought it was condescending and demeaning. Former admirers, such as the producer Billy Rose, condemned Walt as well. One group, the Theatre Chapter of the National Negro Congress, picketed theaters where the film was shown.</p>
<p>But remarkably for a man who took everything personally, this disappointment did not sour Walt on race relations the way the strike had soured him on unions. He successfully fought to get Baskett an honorary Oscar when Baskett fell seriously ill shortly after the film&rsquo;s release, and he was especially solicitous to Baskett&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>More, his later live-action films typically promoted racial tolerance, and he was much more sympathetic to Native Americans than most of his contemporaries. {snip}</p>

		<p>In my opinion Walt Disney was a good man and it reflected in the wonderful entertainment he provided for my generation and the generation before.  There is a noticeable decline in the quality of Disney&rsquo;s movies since Michael Eisner took over as CEO in the mid 1980&rsquo;s.  I wouldn&rsquo;t buy any of the new CD&rsquo;s if they were marked down to 99 cents.</p>

		<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why the earlier Disney films were so successful.  It&rsquo;s well known that when diversity trumps quality, the standard immediately goes south.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s on fire but some folks still have time to complain that their race is represented positively enough in the media.  What a wonderful life they must have if that&rsquo;s all they have to worry about.  I am still waiting for the black/brown Santa&hellip;we know it&rsquo;s coming.</p>

		<p>All the Disney animated features from the &rsquo;30s to the &rsquo;60s are genious. Even up until the early &rsquo;80s some Disney features almost reach classic status. Starting in the &rsquo;90s, Disney features have been mostly junk.</p>
<p>And since when is painting white European culture black &#8216;post-racial&rsquo;? I guess &#8216;post-racial&rsquo; is the new new euphemism for black supremacy.</p>

		<p><i>Indeed, &ldquo;Song of the South&rdquo; seems to give credence to the idea that Walt was clueless when it came to race.</i></p>
<p>It certainly does. For its time, it was fairly anti-white and leftist.</p>
<p>The white mother is not portrayed sympathetically; her explicit reasons for her separation of her son from Remus are seemingly nonsensical, needlessly causing her son and Remus pain.</p>
<p>But she is still better than the poor whites in the film. While she may have been thoughtlessly cruel, the two poor white boys are simply malevolent.</p>
<p>It is the white mother and poor whites in the film who are the enemies of everybody just being happy and getting along. While the blacks in the film may have been subservient to the rich white family, they were still &#8216;television blacks&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This is where parental guidance comes in.</p>

		<p>&#8221; Disney&rsquo;s kindnesses to blacks and Indians wins him no credit &#8220;</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not winning him any money either, not from this newest film, The Princess and the Frog. I work in retail, and I can tell you it&rsquo;s a fact that the merchandise from this film is NOT selling. Not the Princess Tiana shirts, dolls, bedding, night gowns, NONE of it.</p>
<p>Sales floor space in a major retail store is valuable, and busniess is business. If they can&rsquo;t make money from it, they WILL get rid of it.</p>

		<p>Disney&rsquo;s official position on SOTS, which they are rumored to start selling in the U.S. soon (they do sell it in the UK), is that its content should only be seen and understood by enlightened film students.  In other words, Mickey thinks that us schmucks in flyover country are so stupid that we can&rsquo;t see a cartoon movie without wanting to run out and reimplement slavery.</p>

		<p>A European fairy tale featuring a black &#8216;princess&rsquo; is simply silly, that&rsquo;s probably the true reason that nobody is purchasing the merchandise. Royalty is not an African concept, no royal house of Europe had black members (any more than the Zulu or other tribes had white members) and a black girl tricked up in old fashioned European clothes looks plain stupid. </p>
<p>The true reason for endless black whining about European customs is that blacks know very well that they have no real place in white countries. Just as Europeans could not adopt black African customs, values and morality tales, blacks cannot adopt ours. It makes them bitter and angry, always feeling that they will never belong. The difference between us is that Europeans would never wish to be be regarded as black Africans, but many blacks wish to be regarded as Europeans.</p>

<p>I guess we know the hierarchy of hate and which hate is the worst.</p>
<p>The Frog Prince was #1 at the box office this weekend. What&rsquo;s interesting is that there was a large turnout of adults without children.</p>
<p>In the past, blacks have conspired to go to black films to artificially raise their status. There was a famous example of this a couple years ago but the film title eludes me (likely because it was a poor film).</p>
<p>I suspect blacks are trying to raise the attendance numbers for this film to make it appear that black themed films are money makers.</p>
<p>And as always, if blacks don&rsquo;t believe white folk make enough or their kind of black films then this is a golden opportunity to start a black production company and make millions.</p>
<p>Tyler Perry did it. Unfortunately, his stereotypes of the black community rile too many black people who are &#8216;outraged&rsquo; by such films. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to Mr. Perry however, he&rsquo;s a multi-millionaire who got rich by giving blacks the films with characters they want to see.<br>

<p>These people, at least the writer of this piece, subscribe to the theory, if you are white, it&rsquo;s not a question of If you are racist or oppressive or bigoted, you simply are. It&rsquo;s only a question of degree. The only way to avoid the label is to accuse others in a properly effective manner.</p>

<p>Your black/brown Santa was already here, and then left again: I live in San Jose, CA. They anuually have a &#8216;Christmas in the Park&rsquo; whith a Santa in his shop, community displays, carnival rides, and merchants. A few years back, there was a kiosk tent selling inflatable Christmas characters for the children. All the Santa faces were brown (we have a huge latino population). The white merchants didn&rsquo;t seem to care about the innacuracy when heckled on their &#8216;Santa with a tan from a southern land.<br>
The brown Santas were only seen that one year and have not made a return.</p>

		<p>Observer - regarding racism in Dumbo:  the crows there are not portrayed in a more derogatory/humorous/stereotyped fashion than are the Cajun lightning bugs in The Princess and the Frog.</p>
<p>Disney would never portray blacks today, and probably hasn&rsquo;t ever, as the grotesque, stupid, violent buffoons the white frog hunters are in this latest movie.  It&rsquo;s true that the stupid grotesquerie was not portrayed as a specifically white characteristic - so it&rsquo;s not racist in that sense - but Disney would not dare do it to blacks.</p>

		<p>Who cares about Disney. They are money grubbing insects, all set to the tune of &#8216;zip a dee doo dah&rsquo;. Disney stole all of the characters he used make his multi billions. Disney had no originality or talent. He took his partner&rsquo;s great artistic ideas, then bankrupted him. <br>
This terrible movie is just another feather in the cap of the black freemasons - Obama, Oprah and all of the white left wing nuts who wish they were born black.<br>
Did anyone ever hear about the &#8216;baby einstein&rsquo; videos DISNEY put out ? They are being sued, because the kids FAR LESS Intelligent AFTER watching these great videos. Look it up on the &#8216;net.<br>
Leave Disney and 90% of the mass media where it belongs - in the toilet.</p>

		<p>    If he were alive today, Walt Disney would be classified as a white supremacist.  He was also no friend of integration and kept blacks off the Mouseketeers for years. The current mania for multiculturalism can be traced to Michael Eisner and his famous dictum: &#8220;no snow, no rural.&rdquo; The Disney channel is the most multicultural and &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; of the current children&rsquo;s channels. </p>

		<p>Disney went down the multicult pc trail when Eisner took over. Walt&rsquo;s brother was devastated by what he (Eisner) and his cronies did to Disney. Just like all of Hollywood everything they touch turns to anti-White propaganda. Sure wish McCarthy had of gotten rid of all those commies in Hollywood. He knew who and what they were.</p>

		<p>I am lucky that I have a copy of &#8220;Song of the South&#8221; and I did not find it offensive.  My sister and I had the Song of the South story books when we were children.</p>
<p>I loved Walt Disney as a child and under the new politically correct leadership at Disney, I have enjoyed SOME of the animated features.  However, I was very disturbed by the suggestive messages inserted into several of the animated features, Lion King and Rescurers Down Under are a couple of examples.  I won&rsquo;t patronage Disney World because of their forced homosexual agenda such as &#8220;Gay and Lesbian Week.&#8221;  </p>
<p>But I knew years ago that after having released animated princess movies depicting a Native American (Pocohantas), Asian (Mulan), Arab (Aladdin), I knew that it was just a matter of time before Disney would feature an African princess.  It isn&rsquo;t that I&rsquo;m racially insensitive but just like dolls and other toys geared towards African Americans, which I wouldn&rsquo;t purchase for my granddaughter, I don&rsquo;t intend on spending money to see the new &#8220;Frog Princess&#8221; movie.  </p>

		<p>Walt Disney was a racist(in particular, he was huge anti-semite).  So what?  If he was alive, chances are he wouldn&rsquo;t care what other people thought about it.  He made cartoons popular and established an enterprise now worth countless fortunes, what have race traitor liberals ever accomplished besides whining?</p>

		<p>It saddens me to see people using terms like &#8220;obtuse&#8221; and &#8220;clueless&#8221; to describe attitudes that are nothing more than an acknowledgement of the blatant truth.  I have read about a new Disney film about the Frog Prince, in which the princess is black.  I wonder - princess of what country?  No doubt there are palaces (in Africa?) and all the trimmings of these stories involved, but&hellip; a black princess?  It&rsquo;s completely gratuitous, with no cultural basis whatsoever.</p>
<p>As I said, I wonder how they think they can pull this off, but not to the exent of actually finding out. I certainly will not be watching this, or any future Disney offerings.</p>

		<p>Growing up in Los Angeles and Orange County, I&rsquo;ve followed Disney for almost five decades. The leftist attacks on Disney are, in my view, simply a tactic to demonize beloved Western figures as part of an overall anti-white strategy. There&rsquo;s really not much else to it. The fact they are down to trolling for Walt Disney should tell us all they don&rsquo;t have much to go on.</p>

		<p>I have read a number of commentators praising the making of this film and how it&rsquo;s ground breaking, relevant, and a step forward for Disney.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read only one review of this film and it wasn&rsquo;t a very good review; something like **1/2 stars out of four, meaning &#8216;average&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I suspect it&rsquo;s an OK kind of average film which is why there&rsquo;s so much more emphasis on praising the producers than the product.</p>
<p>Again I come back to my first comment. Hollywood seems intent on making these film and praising each other and themselves for producing them. That they&rsquo;re good or bad or make money or not, the MESSAGE seems to be what&rsquo;s important.</p>

		<p>How soon before some &#8220;black scholar&#8221; comes out apoplectic about the portrayal of Princess Tiana in this movie? Disney will have to kick it&rsquo;s PR machine into gear, donate money to some black cause and apologize profusely to make the whole thing go away. My money says that Princess Tiana will be the last black princess that we will ever see from Disney and the company will stick to the safety white people and nonhuman characters. The people who think Disney (the man and the company) are racist will not be persuaded by anything, so the company will naturally go with something that generates money and no bad press. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Disney stole all of the characters he used make his multi billions. Disney had no originality or talent. He took his partner&rsquo;s great artistic ideas, then bankrupted him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Proof?</p>

		<p>I thought I saw an article that said Prince Naveen was White in that movie but looking at pictures of him his skin tone is almost as dark as Princess Tiana&rsquo;s.  </p>

		<p>If Walt Disney was truly anti-Semitic, then I doubt he would have won as many Oscars as he did, a toal of 11. After all, Hollywood was dominated by the likes of Samuel Goldwyn, Louis Mayer and Irving Thalberg, men who weren&rsquo;t exactly Bulgarians.</p>

		<p>Most people of his era were at least a little &#8220;racist&#8221;, although it is probably a helpful trait in his case though. Disney was in the business of selling dreams and fantasies. Little girls want to grow up to be snow white or cinderalla, i.e. beautiful white princesses, we all on this website how even minority girls prefer white looking toy dolls over black ones. No little white girl day dreams about growing up to be a black girl from New Orleans.</p>
