<h1>Is the Belgian and Dutch Tradition of Black Peter Racist?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Ames, Minneapolis Post, December 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>To a visitor from across the Atlantic the scene would be disconcerting to say the least.</p>
<p>Dozens of young Europeans in satin britches and curly afro wigs, in blackface, cavort through a gleeful crowd. Their rouged lips and darkened faces recall the notorious minstrel shows of 19th-century America.</p>
<p>Dressed in scarlet and blue, with lace collars and feathered caps, the performers descend on ropes from the neo-gothic Town Hall tower. One walks a tightrope high above the market square. Flashing white grins, groups scamper around the packed plaza scattering fistfuls of candy to delighted kids.</p>
<p>Welcome to the world of Zwarte Piet, or Black Peter, the controversial character who replaces the elves as Santa&rsquo;s little helper in Belgium and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>To some, St. Nick&rsquo;s black-painted assistant represents a harmless and cherished tradition. To others it&rsquo;s outdated, offensive and inappropriate in an increasingly multi-ethnic European society.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has to be the most racist celebration in contemporary Western civilization,&#8221; writes Anthony Murrell, a black American resident of Amsterdam. &#8220;It serves as a virtual assault on all black and brown people living in Holland.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although many Dutch and Belgian families now also give gifts at Christmas, traditionally the big day for children in the Low Countries has been St. Nicholas day on Dec. 6. The celebration recognizes a fourth-century bishop from what is now Turkey who became renowned among medieval Christians for his generosity and help for children.</p>
<p>A kindly, white bearded figure in red bishop&rsquo;s robes, the Dutch &#8220;Sinterklaas&#8221; became the prototype for Santa Claus in 19th-century America.</p>
<p>Around the same time, back in the Netherlands, St. Nick gained a black assistant. His origins are obscure. Some say he evolved from a devil tamed by the saint, others that Pete is an Ethiopian slave freed by St. Nick, or a Moor with origins in Spain. Attempts to make him more politically correct suggest that Black Pete&rsquo;s black face is actually the result of climbing down chimneys to deliver presents.</p>
<p>Initially Black Pete was a frightening figure who would whip bad children or bundle them off to Spain in his sack, while Saint Nicholas rewarded the well-behaved with treats. These days, Pete has mellowed into a mischevious scamp who assists his elderly boss with the present distribution business.</p>
<p>In this town named for the saint, there&rsquo;s no doubt who the kids are most excited to see. &#8220;Zwarte Piet, Zwarte Piet,&#8221; they shout as the youths in blackface toss candy into the air while inhabitants of Sint-Niklaas  &mdash;  including several members of its sizable black community  &mdash;  celebrate the annual arrival of their patron saint on Nov. 15.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past, December was not a happy time for me,&#8221; said Wouter Van Bellingen, the first black alderman elected to the Sint-Niklaas city council. &#8220;As a child I&rsquo;d go out to the market and kids would shout &#8216;oh look there goes Zwarte Piet.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not like that anymore. Fifteen years ago they hardly saw a black person. There&rsquo;s been an evolution, the culture has changed,&#8221; Van Bellingen said in a telephone interview. &#8220;People see Black Peter as a tradition, but kids don&rsquo;t make a link with the black people they see in class or in the street everyday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Van Bellingen hit international headlines in 2007 when three local couples refused to allow the newly elected black councilor to officiate at their weddings. {snip}</p>
<p>After complaints from immigrant groups, efforts have been made in The Netherlands to replace Black Pete&rsquo;s blackface with rainbow-colored makeup, but such initiatives have had little success.</p>
<p>Van Bellingen thinks banning the blackface would be counterproductive  &mdash;  he thinks it will simply fade away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m convinced that Zwarte Piet will disappear. People say it&rsquo;s part of Europe&rsquo;s heritage, but Europe is changing, becoming more [diverse].&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In 20 years, Zwarte Piet will no longer be an image we see in Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, Anthony, has it ever occurred to you that you don&rsquo;t <i>have</i> to live in Holland?  I&rsquo;m sure you wouldn&rsquo;t be &#8220;<i>virtually</i> assaulted&#8221; back in Africa.  You&rsquo;d get the real thing there, instead.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the &#8220;reporter&#8221; who banged out this propaganda piece just couldn&rsquo;t find one single person who thought that the &#8220;Black Peter&#8221; custom was a fine old tradition.  Gosh, how odd.<br>

<p>To the contrary, in another 15 years of immigration,  there will be so many black people that back Petes will be everywhere.  Nobody will look because black faces will be the norm. </p>
<p>In time, white faces will become the rarity.  (They already are in some large cities.)</p>

		<p>Has there ever been a racial group in human history for whom everyone must make the allowances apparently due black Africans?</p>
<p>Has there ever been a racial group in all history, which though heavily exposed to Western culture, technology, science, political achievement, and medicine for centuries, has so little to show for this broad exposure, so little actual achievement of their own, a group which represents a great and implacable burden to every nation which grants them entry?</p>
<p>How much longer can this go on, how much more inventive and convoluted can become the explanations for their chronic incapacity?</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how China, as she emerges as the dominant power of the 21st Century, deals with them, particularly as she casts her covetous eyes, unclouded by maudlin sentimentality, on the African continent and its stupendous riches.</p>

<p>I suppose this is all for the greater good. Once we purge ourselves of these &#8216;racist&rsquo; stereotypes, blacks will be unburdened and free to be our equals.</p>

		<p>john at 7:30 PM, great post. We will see how China does as the re-colonization of Africa by China is well underway though largely absent in the news. And some astonishing stuff has been taking place in what amounts to an Asian land grab. This has also been viewed as a probable release valve due to the dearth of females in China (infanticide due to the one child rule and families preferring males; &#8220;Go West, Young Man&#8221;). The hybrid offspring with Han paternal genes and African mtDNA will predictably become the ruling class in a generation or two. And, as always lighter skin will be cherished and prized. But will they manufacture the requisite cosmetic creams on the dark continent or import them from the China? Should be interesting. </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with it?  I found the custom and the picture to be quite warm and friendly and endearing. It&rsquo;s a nice custom.  There was nothing abusive or insulting about it. Nothing to take offense at! </p>
<p>Is there a more thin-skinned race than this who will take offense at anything at all?  </p>
<p>Apparently black and brown people just don&rsquo;t like being portrayed as black and brown people. To show them as themselves is highly insulting!</p>

		<p>As a Dutchman born in a Dutch colony my family always had Black Pete but the story that we were told is nothing like the media portrays today. My grandmother, born in 1909, told me that Black Pete was a bad (white) boy who was naughty and didn&rsquo;t do his homework, his lack of education forced him to become a chimney sweep, which is why he has a black face. Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of children, saved Black Pete from the child labour he was being forced to endure by taking him as his assistant. Good children got presents and bad children got coal, and the very naughty were taken away by Saint Nicholas to work in his presents factory. I should note that my ancestors were mercantile traders so naturally school was very important, which may have had an effect on how the story was told. </p>
<p>When my family moved to Australia the local Dutch community believed that when Saint Nicholas went to Spain he found a young Moorish boy who was born into a life of slavery. Saint Nicholas liberated Black Pete but the boy had known nothing but captivity and he was scared of his new found freedom, so he decided to help Saint Nicholas as a Free Servant rather than enjoy his liberty alone. Some say that Black Pete thanked Saint Nicholas for freeing him and decided to repay him by helping him help others, which goes back to the original story of Saint Nicholas who put coins in peoples shoes as he walked through the cities of Europe, which is why he became a Saint in the first place.</p>

		<p>#9&rsquo;s observations are on the mark.  Would blacks like it better if Black Peter were portrayed as white?  Wouldn&rsquo;t THAT be racist?  And isn&rsquo;t the rainbow face an insult to gays?  Or Santa&rsquo;s white beard evidence of ageism?  <br>
This is the kind of nonsense that makes many non-blacks reluctant to associate with blacks.  If a white works with them or lives next door, who knows what they will find racist and insulting?  Dare someone display a pink flamingo in his yard?  Will it be found to be a low-brow implication of diving property values?  Or a hint that people with tropical ancestry have moved in?  <br>
It&rsquo;s interesting that no one has yet complained that Santa demeans Germanic people with his &#8220;Ho, ho, ho&#8221; and little round belly that shakes like a bowlful of jelly.  Of course, Germans are proud of who they are  &mdash;  and some ethnicities are not.</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;re black or non-white, you have no right to move to a white country and whine and complain about the natives or their culture.  Likewise, if you&rsquo;re white and you move to Africa, you have no right to complain about anti-white racism or complain about how backwards and savage they are. Live in another&rsquo;s country, accept their culture, shut up, and keep to yourself.  Problems solved.</p>

<p>How is this charming, innocent tradition considered an &#8220;assault&#8221; on anybody?</p>
<p>They should be pleased and flattered that they are included. The alternative would be to erase them completely from the culture and from all visible depictions. Perhaps that would be best. Then they would have nothing to complain about. Oh, I suppose they would complain about being omitted.   Can&rsquo;t win!<br>
The bottom line seems to be that blacks resent being shown as black.</p>

<p>Actually, to the one-third to one half of the American people who have a strong German-speaking ancestry, der Schwarze Peter is very familiar.  Even in public school in the 1940&rsquo;s we were read stories about Saint Nicholas and Black Peter.  Just because Obongo might have had a poor education does not make Black Peter un-American.</p>

		<p>#7PMN, are you serious?  Do you honestly believe that Chinese men will take up with and raise families with native African women?  There is absolutely no realistic chance of that happening on a large scale.  Do you really believe that Chinese/African hybrids born and bred in darkest Africa would think and behave any differently than their full-African cousins?  That is ridiculous.  Ask any white South African how Cape Cloured people differ in temperament and behaviour from the local blacks, the answer you get will be simply &#8220;they don&rsquo;t&#8221;.  And China is not going to conquer and colonize Africa any more successfully than the Europeans attempted to.  Africa&rsquo;s will inevitably overwhelm their Chinese guests the same way they did everyone else who ever tried to civilize that continent.   </p>

		<p>John (#5), you don&rsquo;t really need to wonder how China &#8220;will deal with them&#8221;.  Rwanda was a practice drill, and South Africa is a work-in-progress.  Imagine the Daleks from Dr. Who, rolling about, chanting &#8220;exterminate&hellip;.exterminate&hellip;&#8221;.  Asians regard Africans as, at best, superfluous biomass.  </p>
<p>What scares me about the Black Pete character is that he would bundle bad children off to Spain.  Spain occupied and exploited the Low Countries for a while, and the psychic (and genetic) damage from that occupation persists to this day.  I&rsquo;m wondering how many Dutch children actually were sent off to Spain as slaves (sometimes kidnapped, no doubt by the you-know-who, and brokered, I imagine, by the you-know-who-else).  I guess the boys would be&hellip;um&hellip;neutered&hellip; in Spain (Barcelona, mainly), and then the (surviving) kids would be sold to the Moslems.  Funny the author didn&rsquo;t mention anything like that&hellip;.</p>

<p><br>
Neither have I. It&rsquo;s wildly far-fetched.  I suspect the time frame she had in mind might have been the earlier Middle Ages, even up to the time of the Children&rsquo;s Crusade; but that was centuries before the crown of Spain came into possession of the Netherlands.<br>
Oh, and by the time that Spain controlled the Netherlands (1500s), there were none of &#8216;those people&rsquo; she mentioned still living there (in Barcelona) who would have &#8220;brokered&#8221; those children to the Moslems.   Sheer fantasy.</p>
