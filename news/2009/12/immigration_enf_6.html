<h1>Immigration Enforcement  &mdash;  A Jobs Program</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Krikorian, National Review, December 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Restricting immigration is fundamentally different from restricting trade in two ways, one theoretical, one practical. First, people are not things  &mdash;  in addition to being labor inputs, they also happen to be people. This isn&rsquo;t a new insight, but one that apparently requires repeating. The general principle, unrelated to immigration, was articulated by Peter Drucker when, in The Practice of Management, he recommended &#8220;consideration of the human resource as human beings having, unlike any other resource, personality, citizenship, control over whether they work, how much and how well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; Henry Ford is said to have expressed the businessman&rsquo;s frustration at this, asking &#8220;Why is it every time I ask for a pair of hands, they come with a person attached?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the immigration context, Teddy Roosevelt made the same point: &#8220;Never under any condition should this nation look at an immigrant as primarily a labor unit.&#8221; Economists have drawn the same conclusion: Henry Simons, the pioneer advocate of the benefits of free-market economics at the University of Chicago, wrote in 1948 that &#8220;to insist that a free trade program is logically or practically incomplete without free migration is either disingenuous or stupid. Free trade may and should raise living standards everywhere.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Free immigration would level standards, perhaps without raising them anywhere.&#8221; Likewise, libertarian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe has written that &#8220;free trade and restricted immigration are not only perfectly consistent, but even mutually reinforcing policies.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So, specifically at a time of high unemployment when the economy is losing jobs, enforcement of immigration law is an immediate, low-cost jobs program  &mdash;  at least for Americans and legal immigrants, who are the only ones our government is authorized to be concerned about. There are twice as many unemployed Americans as there are employed illegal aliens, and while jobs aren&rsquo;t just lollipops you take away from one person and give to another, vigorous enforcement could easily open up a quarter-million or half-million jobs held by illegal aliens in no time.</p>

		<p>I agree with the conclusion, but not the rationale.  Free trade and open borders (add to that imperial occupation of other countries, plus anti-racist and anti-nationalist domestic civil rights policies within the country) are related, and the more of one you have, the more of the other(s) that you will be compelled to enact.  They are all appendages of the octopus of globalism and universalism.  Egalitarianism is not a calling that tolerates inconsistency and half-rumping matters, and if you don&rsquo;t allow discrimination based on products based on their national origin, then it stands to reason that allowing discrimination against potential migrants based on their national origin, or internal domestic minorities based on their racial or ethnic heritage, cannot stand.  And if you have a powerful enough military, you have to trot around to every country in the world not towing the egalitarian line and shove a bayonet into the throats of every discriminator, human rights violator or hater.</p>
<p>The original Marxist, Karl Marx, opposed secession, racial discrimination and nationalism.  He also supported free trade, and that is not a contradiction   &mdash;   as he wrote, free trade breaks down nationalism.  (Today&rsquo;s &#8220;communists,&#8221; aka the Communist Party USA and their dopey publication, opposes free trade.  They evidently don&rsquo;t know that much about their hero.) </p>
<p>I mean, the (h/t to Jupiter) native born white American who doesn&rsquo;t have a job because of cheap labor in Mexico and China is just as much unemployed as the native born white American who doesn&rsquo;t have a job because of cheap labor from Asia or Mexico imported into the country legally or illegally.</p>
<p>Trade and immigration policies should be freer (note the &#8220;r&#8221; at the end, because I mean &#8220;freer&#8221; but NOT totally &#8220;free&#8221;) with countries whose citizens have similar wage, salary and non-pecuniary life expectations, and whose countries&rsquo; governments have similar labor and environmental regulations, as the United States.  That means mainly Europe, and more specifically, the UK, Germanic and Scandinavian peoples, and some Mediterraneans. </p>

		<p>Amnesty will go through and the US empire will deteriorate a little further economically and socially.  </p>
<p>Healthcare will pass also, which will include illegals, and the economy will deteriorate even further.</p>
<p>Residential and commercial real estate will collapse again soon, and that will just about put the finishing touches on this multicultural monstrosity that will turn out to be just another failed empire, just like Rome and Britain.</p>

		<p>I read on a well-known immigration site, that despite the fact that our economy is sinking, Washington is allowing one-hundred twenty thousand people a month to still come to the U.S. LEGALLY!! The reason given was the interference of so many lobbies that are pushing massive immigration. They do not want a precedent set, and will do anything, despite the suffering of millions of Americans, to keep the mass immigration going. Americans really have absolutely no control over their nation. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad this neocon rag of the fake right is finally talking common sense about immigration enforcement but I have to wonder if they&rsquo;re really serious.  Remember it wasn&rsquo;t that long ago they were vomiting some verbage about &#8220;Comprehensive Immigration Reform&#8221;.  I think it&rsquo;s more likely they are deathly afraid of being flushed in 2010 and finally shut out of American politics once and for all.  They will do or say anything at this point.  It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me at this point if they donned blackface and sang &#8220;Dixie&#8221; if it could rake in some votes.  </p>

		<p>Make &#8220;border enforcement&#8221; to include an end to the insanity of handing out H1b visas by the basket full!</p>
<p>Americans have it tough enough without the obscenity of having immigrants fresh off the plane&hellip; ready and willing to undercut them; to work for half the prevailing wage in today&rsquo;s tough job market. It might justifiably be pointed out that immigrants generally do not have mortgages, student loans, families and health insurance costs and thus can AFFORD to undercut American workers at all job levels.</p>

		<p>  Immigration should be completely linked to unemployment. As long as unemployment is above three percent, there should be absolutely no immigration. It is insane to let in millions of workers when unemployment is above hovering above ten percent. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right, but the bad news for our cause is that, all other things being equal, mass immigration will reduce the unemployment rate.  A legal or illegal immigrant doing a job that would not otherwise be available to the native-born white American counts in the unemployment stats, and reduces the u.rate.  And the employer benefits with lower wages and salaries.  The loser is the typical native-born white American.</p>
