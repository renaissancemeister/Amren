			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Courtland Milloy, Washington Post, Dec. 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If you thought James Cameron&rsquo;s &#8220;Avatar&#8221; was just a 3-D fantasy flick about nice cat people vs. mechanized mad men, think again. There&rsquo;s a fourth dimension, a shadowy back story about race that has the sci-fi blogosphere engaged in its own war of the worlds. </p>
<p>Annalee Newitz, writing last week on her science blog io9, criticized &#8220;Avatar&#8221; for depicting yet another white man as a hero in the liberation struggles of oppressed people of color. </p>
<p>As happens in movies such as &#8220;District 9,&#8221; &#8220;Dances With Wolves&#8221; and &#8220;The Last Samurai,&#8221; Newitz wrote, &#8220;a white guy manages to get himself accepted into a closed society of people of color and eventually becomes its most awesome member.&#8221; </p>
<p>I came away from &#8220;Avatar&#8221; with a similar feeling, although not nearly as strong as I had after watching, say, &#8220;Mississippi Burning,&#8221; which portrayed the FBI as heroes of the civil rights movement. </p>
<p>And yet, I&rsquo;d recommend seeing &#8220;Avatar,&#8221; not only for the sensational special effects but also to participate in an important discussion about race. </p>
<p>As a movie summary, suffice it to say that an ex-Marine named Jake Sully uses futuristic means to transform himself from a human, or Sky Person, into a Na&rsquo;vi cat person. Then he infiltrates the cat people to gather intelligence for a military invasion but ends up falling in love with a cat woman. A &#8220;race traitor&#8221; to his fellow humans, Sully leads the cat people in thwarting the military invasion. </p>
<p>&#8220;This is the essence of the white guilt fantasy, laid bare,&#8221; Newitz wrote. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not just a wish to be absolved of the crimes whites have committed against people of color; it&rsquo;s not just a wish to join the side of moral justice in battle. It&rsquo;s a wish to lead people of color from the inside rather than from the (oppressive, white) outside. Think of it this way. Avatar is a fantasy about ceasing to be white, giving up the old human meatsack to join the blue people, but never losing white privilege.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Some might wonder how blue cat people become stand-ins for oppressed people of color. It&rsquo;s more obvious than it seems. </p>
<p>You can tell some cat people are Native Americans, for instance, because, as Newitz describes them, they &#8220;wear feathers in their hair, worship nature gods, paint their faces for war, use bows and arrows, and live in tribes.&#8221; </p>
<p>In addition to Native Americans, I saw some cat people as black people in disguise. This racial effect is cleverly accomplished by using certain speech patterns and body language. One cat man spoke with a West Indian accent, for instance. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Newitz concluded: &#8220;Speaking as a white person &hellip; I&rsquo;d like to watch some movies about people of color &hellip; from the perspective of that group, without injecting a random white &hellip; character to explain everything to me.&#8221; </p>
<p>Eric Ribellarsi, writing on the anti-imperialist blog Fire Collective, fired back at the critics: </p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a story about a white man who goes to lead native peoples as their condescending savior&hellip; . It&rsquo;s a story about a backward white man who is transformed and takes up armed struggle against imperialism alongside them.&#8221; </p>
<p>He cited the radical abolitionist John Brown as a possible template for the Sully character. In leading the fateful raid on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Brown, in effect, became a black man and gave his life in the fight against slavery. </p>
<p>Sully becomes blue and puts his life on the line for the Na&rsquo;vi.</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer my sci-fi movies to be mindless escapism. But when it comes to a national discussion about race  &mdash;  to the extent that there is one at all  &mdash;  I accept the reality that Hollywood is the moderator and the Internet is the forum.</p>

		<p>By the way, I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that the natives in this movie had to rely on white intellectual resources to galvanize various tribal groups against the imperialists, which the Native Americans never did.  They couldn&rsquo;t fight off the white settlers because they couldn&rsquo;t conceive of the land as theirs.  Without being able to stake a claim rooted in abstract principles of just ownership, they had no cause to fight for.  Of course, they couldn&rsquo;t band together like the natives in Avatar because they lacked the fellow feeling necessary to establish nationalist solidarity.  Funny if you watch this anti-white hate screed, you&rsquo;ll see that it is in many ways a celebration of white Judeo-Christianity principles of morality and justice.  </p>

		<p>This is all part of the century long war of marxism against Western civilization.  It would be laughable if not for the fact that the only people crazy enough to believe such garbage are more often than not working in legislatures, courts, and government bureaucracies making and enforcing bad public policy built on insane philosophy and false history. </p>

		<p>In what sense is watching a movie &#8220;participating&#8221; in a discussion? Only in the role that our lords and masters have assigned to us - they tell us what to believe, and we obey.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen the movie, nor shall I. From the article, there appears to be some disagreement over whether the hero is sufficiently repentant, but not over the need for repentance of all White men. In other words, it&rsquo;s just more of the same old diversity training.  Scroom.</p>

<p>Of course it is:<br>
The analagous-Native Americans (the aliens) are paragons of human nature while the majority of the analagous-whites (the humans are little more than demons given flesh.</p>
<p>It speaks to the self-hating white notion that non-whites are <i>inherently</i> good, while whites are <i>inherently</i> evil.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Newitz concluded: &ldquo;Speaking as a white person &hellip; I&rsquo;d like to watch some movies about people of color &hellip; from the perspective of that group, without injecting a random white &hellip; character to explain everything to me.&rdquo; </i>&#8220;</p>
<p>Really?<br>
So she&rsquo;d like to hear about the numerous objections &#8220;noble&#8221; <i>African</i> chiefs and kings had against <i>Europeans</i> ending their (very profitable) slave trade? How the &#8220;noble&#8221; Mongolian hordes reduced Baghdad, the centre of Arabic learning, to waste? What the Maori of New Zealand did to the Mori-Ori?</p>
<p>Of course not - she, like every other self-hating white, just wants to indulge in one-dimensional fantasies of non-whites as paragons of virtue, religion and evironmentalism.</p>
<p>Even as the evidence says otherwise<br>

		<p>The Washington Post (WP) has to be one of the most race neurotic publications in the nation.  Recently, they have also been emphasizing (I am not making this up) racism in China against blacks who have somehow wound up there.</p>
<p>The WP itself has deteriorated in the past couple of decades from a newspaper that still had a few respectable attributes to a shallow rag that wallows in all forms of political correctness.  The Sunday Outlook section often has articles that are beyond absurd, yet we are to believe the WP is run by professional journalists??  Unfortunately, the WP is permeated with Marxist, racial, class warfare nonsense and it is evident in many of the articles.<br>

		<p>Note the following comments from the Post&rsquo;s comment section:</p>
<p>Wow, so whites being evil is a given, and a white going over to the saintly virtuous non-whites is objectionable because it messes up the simple whites bad, non-whites good, whites can&rsquo;t be redeemed and should just shut up and sit down message.</p>
<p>Long forgotten is the reality that the language of universal justice by which whites are being condemned was invented by whites.</p>
<p>No non white civilization ever showed the slightest interest in the rights or well being of those unlike themselves before being influenced by whites.</p>
<p>Whites and non whites alike have shown ethno-centrism and have committed aggression and oppression both within their groups and toward outsiders.</p>
<p>Demonizing whites as uniquely evil is false, an inversion of history, a black-and-white (even) lie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick of the poisonous anti white racial hatred and lies suffusing our culture and media, and government too.</p>
<p>If it keeps up, the reaction will be very sharp indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;James Cameron made a great movie, while incorporating a lot of history that is rarely focused on.</p>
<p>Regarding the Native Americans, the parrall&rsquo;s were obvious. Native Americans lived in partnership with the land we call the United States. Sure they had wars, they fought with each other, however they cherished the land they conquered from their enemies and the treated it with the same respect as their homelands.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>This &#8220;noble nature lover&#8221; stuff is complete myth. Geologically speaking, the INSTANT the Indians arrived over the Bering Strait, mass extinctions off all kinds of exotic megafauna began. Ancient horses, camels, big cats, elephants, giant sloths.</p>
<p>The only reason the Indians didn&rsquo;t cause more environmental damage was that they were too ineffective. They lacked the technology. 20,000 years on this most lush and resource rich of continents and they didn&rsquo;t even come up with the wheel. A cross section of a log! No metal working other than the softest (gold and silver). Literally stuck in the Stone Age.</p>
<p>If they TRIED to destroy the environment they couldn&rsquo;t have. Not that they didn&rsquo;t set huge fires, run herds over cliffs, and destroy their own rudimentary civilizations in Central America (where they did have any at all) with their own poor environmental planning and dysfunctional fanatical religious butchery.</p>

		<p> I have not seen &#8220;Avatar,&#8221; and after reading these blogs by these self-hating White people, I most certainly never will.</p>
<p> These White liberals just can&rsquo;t let go of this cockamamie notion that White people are to blame for all the world&rsquo;s ills, and that any film that dumps all over Whites is, ipso facto, a &#8220;great movie.&#8221; These two may disagree about a few details, but they obviously agree on one thing: &#8220;Dark people good! White people bad!&#8221; How pathetic!</p>

<p>Turner Classic Movies.  The best thing on TV, &amp; really the only reason we own a TV set anymore.  The 1920s, 30s, 40s, &amp; 50s were far from perfect, but at least people of color were still an exotic novelty, which is clearly what God intended them to be.   </p>

		<p>I thought it was a thoroughly entertaining film. Visually breathtaking and well written. I also loved District 9. </p>
<p>I wish people would stop being so sensitive, otherwise you&rsquo;ll just end up like the majority of blacks and you&rsquo;ll ending up seeing anti-white racism everywhere. </p>
<p>Let the blacks and white liberals see a powerful anti-racism message in it if the want to. It&rsquo;s good to stand up for whites, but you have to get away from it all sometimes. </p>
<p>I thankfully never even thought of a racial angle until someone unfortunately pointed it out to me. Just for once I enjoyed a film without one, you find racial angles nearly everywhere else, and I&rsquo;m sick of it. </p>
<p>Just forget about it, there are much more important things for whites to worry about. The story is an obvious one, and besides, there are plenty of films where the aliens are the bad guys.</p>
<p>I highly recommend the film, definitely go see it on a big screen, and in 3D if possible. Two and a half hours in a whole other universe. It was great! </p>

		<p>Speaking of &#8216;shows&rsquo;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Does anyone else notice the broadband commercials&hellip;the burglar alarm commercials??&hellip;</p>
<p>WHY does it ALWAYS have a White man committing the crimes against an innocent and vunerable White woman and her children??&hellip;.and usually a black man or black woman on the phone and a black cop to come and rescue the naive and vunerable White woman and her children from the evils of the White man&hellip;</p>
<p>THOSE commercials drive me crazy&hellip;..because in the real world we all know its the blacks that are the ones committing the crimes against smaller and weaker Whites, not the other way around..</p>
<p>I have actually called this company on a couple of occasions and told them that this commercial and ones like it are totally false&hellip;.one told me she didnt know what to tell me..the other one laughed and told me that he has never noticed it&hellip;.</p>
<p>Everybody notices though&hellip;.</p>
<p>Some care and some dont&hellip;the ones that dont care are usually the ones that gauge the world by their workplace and neighborhood&hellip;..</p>

<p>Huh?&hellip; All that out of yet-another-stupid-scifi-fantasy movie. I don&rsquo;t know who this nitwit is talking about, but she ain&rsquo;t talking about me.</p>
<p>About the &#8220;struggle against imperialism.&#8221; What struggle? Imperialism, when it was, is the greatest boon the non-whites have ever had. Whites are the ones who got screwed on the deal.<br>

		<p>I saw this movie Avatar. <br>
Filmdom and the media, I know I am being redundant, are totally controlled by the radical leftists. <br>
Have you noticed when you go to see a movie no matter what the venue or who the actors are that you have paid to see, always the very top echelon of power in the movie are blacks. The big dog, the very top cat is black. This top cat may have only a scene or two with only a few lines, something like, okay I am depending on you to get this job done and I have directed all to give you assistance in every way, if they don&rsquo;t you see me. Now go get them.<br>
So Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford, or the like work the whole film for Samuel Jackson or James Earl Jones or someone like.<br>
If you want to know who the people are that run the film industry you should check it out. Some of you will be totally surprised. <br>
Avatar is to me a symbolism of whites hating whites. Whites have been taught to do that by people just like James Cameron.<br>

		<p>Hey Just Saying - you are absolutely correct.  I love TCM.  I pay extra every month for my satellite service so that I can get Turner Classics.  I love the old black and whites.  I don&rsquo;t see them as imperfect, I see them as a large piece of American culture that is rapidly, if not almost completely gone.  There are no actors like James Stewart, John Wayne, James Cagney, etc any longer.  These were men who lived in Hollywood, made movies but still had time to be patriotic white Americans.  They didn&rsquo;t feel it was necessary to get up on their soap box every chance they got to extol the virtues of tolerance and diversity, because luckily for them, there was no such thing.  </p>
<p>Give me a good 1940&rsquo;s 1950&rsquo;s movie anyday over the junk that even James Cameron puts out.</p>

		<p>What I find ironic about these sorts of movies (let&rsquo;s call it the Dances with Smurfs&#8221; genre) is that those that need help (the other) can only prevail with the help of the white man - they are otherwise unable to make it on their own. Which pretty well sums up how liberals feel towards Blacks - they need our money and help, otherwise they are lost. So Blacks still work on the plantation for their masters, unable to stand erect on their own.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed it; we all have. Still, the white actor is usually given most of the action.  Very few black actors can carry a film or TV series.  How many Will Smiths are there in Hollywood&hellip;?  As far as I can tell, just the one.</p>

Without Whites who fund conservation projects mountain gorillas would be gone by now. And not just mountain gorillas, but many other species as well. All the conservation projects in the world are run by Whites, nobody else. </p>

		<p>In other words:</p>
<p>Even making a film against &#8220;racism&#8221; it is in fact racist, if you portray a white hero since this does not reflect real life where white people are inherently racist and wicked beyond redemption, fit only to be slowly bred out of existence.</p>
<p>Showing a white hero fighting against omnipresent monothlitic seething white racism would send a dangerous message that not all whites are evil and even worse the white race might in fact possess positive and unique qualities making that race worth saving or at least not eradicating.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I read quite a bit about it before deciding whether to see it, as I do all movies.  Only a wee fraction are worth watching anymore, but this one, like a large percentage of them seeks to propagandize rather than entertainment.</p>
<p>Too, can we call it the Training Film Industry instead of the Entertainment Industry?  I&rsquo;m a real stickler for accuracy.  You know, like correctly calling the media the mainfringe media, because there&rsquo;s nothing about it that&rsquo;s mainstream.</p>

You are right that only a tiny percentage of contemporary movies are worth watching. Almost all Hollywood productions are intellectual and spiritual poison. I walked into a Hollywood Video the other day and browsed the new releases. The only films that looked remotely compelling were all foreign. I ended up watching the creepy Flemish horror flick &#8216;Left Bank&rsquo; and the Korean noire classic &#8216;Memories of Murder&rsquo;. <br>
American movies tend be garbage with a big budget. </p>

The &#8220;betray your race&#8221; line at the end from the Colonel(or was he a Major?) just made it so blatantly obvious it was unreal.</p>

		<p>Perhaps &#8220;Avatar&#8221; will help people wake up to the unpleasant fact that they are steeped in similar anti-White messages 24/7 in every form of media, education, government, and employment.</p>
<p>Some of us have told people about the deliberate programming, but a nation full of Whites who are addicted to the idiotically meaningless exploits of minority sports and entertainment &#8220;heroes&#8221; simply can&rsquo;t see the forest for the trees.  We should probably THANK Cameron for uprooting a particularly large tree and beating Whites over the head with it in the form of &#8220;Avatar&#8221;.  There&rsquo;s always the chance - miniscule as it is - that some tiny percentage of the White populace might be jarred out of their daze long enough to brush the bark and splinters out of their hair and start to notice what&rsquo;s being done to them.</p>

		<p>I could tell just from the previews that this was an anti-White piece of garbage and we&rsquo;re not going to go watch it. Ever since I had my &#8220;awakening&#8221; if you want to call it that, I&rsquo;ve been able to see past the conditioning and observe the true intentions of a film or what I think are the true intentions.  I don&rsquo;t doubt alot of people on sites like this can see it but I wonder how many people in the general public think this is just a harmless fantasy movie?  There are so few movies out there created for the sole purpose of entertainment.  So many of these propaganda pieces don&rsquo;t make any money it has me wondering whether profit even figures into the equation at all.  They can simply make a few good movies a year to cover the cost of churning out all this other rubbish.  Someone mentioned TCM and I do like to watch alot of their movies but even these genres are not immune from the marxist conditioning.  Humphrey Bogart, for example, has a black actor in almost everyone of his movies that he consoles or is kind towards.  Is it because he&rsquo;s a humanitarian good guy or is it because he was a communist?  I think towards the latter.    </p>

<p>Movie makers make their movies for a cause. They don&rsquo;t make movies for entertainment and then throw in a line or two of propaganda. The movies are made with the cause in mind as the primary reason for the movie. The message is all important. The story line, plot and effects are there to draw the viewer in, to lull him into a state of uncritical acceptance while the message is poured into his head.</p>

I&rsquo;ve read two critics of this film from left-wing publications.</p>
<p>They condemned the film for perpetuating the Hollywood, corporate fantasy that indigenous people successfully fight off the invasion and exploitation by corporate, white, western, imperialist powers.</p>
<p>The argument goes that there are many films that show the &#8216;noble savage&rsquo; winning against imperialism when this has never been the case. By making these kinds of films, it creates the false idea that native people can and do win against white, corporate interests.</p>
<p>These films only create the illusion of victory when the people who make them are only profiting from the same exploitation the films are supposed to expose.</p>

There was another CGI movie that had the same message that seemed to have disappeared. It&rsquo;s called Battle for Terra:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plyRYrqa_4g" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plyRYrqa_4g</a></p>
<p>In the trailer, you can see the evil white leader plans to conquer the planet Terra. The black man acts as the conscience of humanity and the white guy is moved to become the hero to save the aliens on their planet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same formula over and over. Different movie, same message.</p>

     Hello Mr. Henry Stanton # 15. My son attended a seminar sponsered by the federal Government FAA which said that &#8221; Soul Plane &#8221; was a metaphor for the problem of discrimination against African American pilots. The students were taught that smoking pot and snorting cocaine by pilots was a valid response to alcoholism among white pilots which has been winked at by the FAA for generations.<br>
     If you would like to see a valid expose of white brutality I would recommend &#8221; New Jack City. &#8220;<br>

		<p>I remember reading in a psychology textbook that there are two major non-sexual fantasies among boys, the &#8220;suffering hero&#8221; and the &#8220;conquering hero&#8221;.  If that&rsquo;s so, then it seems that this movie taps right into the &#8220;I heroically saved the unfortunate non-Whites&#8221; fantasy.  When I was a boy, I would daydream about shooting down Messerschmitts and Zeros, but of course I didn&rsquo;t come to school and boast of having done so.  But I do sometimes hear some boy bragging about protecting some Black or Jewish kid from &#8220;racist skinheads&#8221;.  It would make sense that White boys fed a steady diet of White guilt and Black equality would love to see themselves as saviors of the non-Whites, or Cat People.  And it would also make sense that the makers of this movie would aim it at that particular adolescent fantasy.  <br>
      The Reds that are complaining about this movie don&rsquo;t know its audience as well as the producer.  They&rsquo;re White kids, not Blue or Black people.  Most White kids don&rsquo;t want to see themselves as evil, and certainly won&rsquo;t want to identify with evil White guys who lose the space war.  They may wish they were blue-skinned, or Black, or whatever it takes to be admired in the juvenile media world they live in, but they&rsquo;re not.  Multi-cultural nose rings and tattoos and &#8220;progressive&#8221; politics can ease the guilt and pain, but they&rsquo;re still White and therefore privileged.  To be the good White guy who saves the angelic Cat People by betraying his race is the best they can do.  And that&rsquo;s what this movie gives them.  Evil, isn&rsquo;t it?   </p>

		<p>I saw it last night. The special effects and digital animation were fantastic!  That part was worth seeing at least. My boyfriend and I both agreed it was an anti-white propaganda film, however. Although the hero is white, the main point is that whites are basically evil and a good one is the exception. I think it was still worth seeing if only for the visual effects and an interesting study of propaganda.  I have come to expect little else from Hollywood. </p>

<p>Something similar was in an animated Disney movie. It was about and Indian and his faithful horse. Only the Indian character was good enough to relate to the noble horse. Only he was in touch with and in empathy with it. The irony being, although the earliest fossils of horses are found in the new world/horses are believed to be originally from the new world, when Columbus discovered America, there were no horses anywhere in North or South America. They were re-imported by settlers after the explorers made contact. It&rsquo;s believed the natives hunted horses to extinction. </p>

		<p>It IS a technically fantastic movie. It also has a story line that is lifted from the conquest of North America by whites. However, the Earth soldiers include plenty of people of ancestry other than white. It is not a story about race conflict  &mdash;  it is a story about insensitivity to the environment, and about imperialism. A story that many white people can appreciate.</p>

		<p>Our overlords are laughing at White people who pay 12.00 dollars to watch this self loathing propaganda.  It&rsquo;s utterly fascinating that even on racial site like this knowing what this movie represents that you can still be mesmerized and compelled to feed the beast. Even recognizing it as propaganda, it still has a hypnotic effect on the brain that allows you to be enslaved.  In my opinion, Hollywood is slowly dying and no longer drives pop culture the way it used to.  Your typical Hollywood formula revolves around having ambiguous looking Whites along with some &#8220;cool&#8221; minority hero/sidekick/scientist/brain surgeon who speaks vernacular English. Throw in some cheap CGI special effects or car crashes and there you have it.  Thankfully even the TV programming is losing audience at least on the networks.  For every person that watches American Idol there are two other people that have never watched it or could care less about it and have low opinions of the people that do.  </p>

		<p>As to why the downtrodden minority has been morphed into blue cat-people in this movie, the answer is simple.</p>
<p>Firstly, it more actively engages the younger audience that has grown up on 3D video games and computer effects.  A fundamental rule of propaganda is that it should be eye catching, easy to understand at a glance, and relentlessly repeated to ensure the public soaks up the desired message.  Observe the portrayal of key elements in this film, and the fact that they are portrayed in brilliant eye-catching colors, and you will see that the film maker WANTED you to focus on those items and themes.</p>
<p>Secondly, it repackages the &#8220;White folks are evil&#8221; line in a way that allows the multicultural message to be internalized without stimulating the problematic knee-jerk reactions that result from the real-world experiences of the audience.  It is easy for the older audience to continue consuming a steady diet of entertainment based on the heroic qualities of minorities, because to a great extent many of them have little interaction with minorities on a day-to-day basis.  It&rsquo;s an entirely different ballgame for their children though, who are growing up in the festering multicultural jungle that the older generation has built for them.  </p>
<p>This younger audience has grown up in an environment where they are terrorized at school, actively discouraged from defending themselves.  It is harder to feed them the same line of &#8220;noble minorities&#8221; propaganda that their elders eagerly swallowed.  Accordingly the film makers have to present the message in a package more palatable to the younger viewers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing new, really - these efforts have been underway since way before Bill Cosby had the &#8220;Fat Albert&#8221; cartoon on TV.  Many of us absorbed the baloney as children, and never realized we had been successfully programmed.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, people - this is NOT happening by accident.  You and your children are being bombarded from every angle with propaganda and legislation designed to FORCE you to accept your own destruction.  Wake up, and start paying attention to the meaning behind the message.</p>
<p>Walk around the mall, and look at the advertising posters.  Marvel at the huge over-representation of Blacks and Hispanics.  Notice the same phenomenon in movies, sports, music, cartoons, books, educational materials, government legislation.  The propaganda is being shoveled on you 24/7, and the vast majority of your swallow it down without even blinking, never realizing how carefully the campaign against you is coordinated.</p>
<p>The enemy&rsquo;s tactics work incredibly well - so successfully in fact that WE PAY for the privilege of absorbing their propaganda.</p>
<p>Think about that for a few minutes, and then think about why it is being done, and where it will lead.  </p>
<p>Helpful hint:  &#8220;Your destruction.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the past, I might not have noticed this, but I was a little under the weather yesterday, and was relegated to flipping through my numerous TV channels.  While I was on the local CBS affiliate, a college basketball game, Rutgers vs West Virginia, was about to start. I noticed that both teams&rsquo; starting five are all black   &mdash;   a state like WV where it&rsquo;s almost entirely white supposedly can&rsquo;t produce one out of five starters on its state flagship University&rsquo;s basketball team.  If there was one white on the bench, then I was surprised, b/c I saw none.  However, all the cheerleaders were white, and all women save one token man per side.  Subtle propaganda for miscegenation, maybe?  Or definitely?  I know when AR posted its classic article about the integration of college football from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, the Sugar Bowl between Georgia Tech and Pitt being the start, one poster said that one of the reasons blacks wanted to be on college sports teams so much is access to white women   &mdash;   based on the axiom that sports stars get attention from the fairer gender.</p>

		<p>A dumb review about a dumb movie. They deserve each other.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I didn&rsquo;t see the flick  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ll wait until it&rsquo;s on cable. But the warning signs were clearly there from the publicity stills and media buzz: white guys insert one of their own into a not-quite-human-but-close-enough-to-make-a-point race of conveniently blue, conveniently &#8220;peaceful&#8221; potential fashion models. </p>
<p>And you know that any movie boasting (or admitting) it&rsquo;s the most expensive computer-graphic extravaganza ever just has to have a Message. And from 21st century Hollywood, that Message is pretty well established by now, to anyone who&rsquo;s been paying attention the last couple of decades.</p>
<p>Sure enough, one reviewer I read hit the nail on the head as I had dimly realized: <i>Avatar</i> is nothing but <i>Dances with Wolves</i> for the ADD generation.</p>
<p>But what especially caught my eye is this quote from the review above:</p>
<p>&#8220;Some might wonder how blue cat people become stand-ins for oppressed people of color. <i>It&rsquo;s more obvious than it seems</i> [emphasis added].&#8221; </p>
<p>This bit of unintended humor reads like a punch line from &#8220;Dilbert&#8221;. This is writing on the level of a high-school student, and not one in an AP class. </p>
<p>  &mdash;  and suddenly I had a flash of suspicion: how does bad writing manage to show up in &#8220;reputable&#8221; media? It&rsquo;s not like this is the first time&hellip; The intials &#8220;AA&#8221; flashed in my mind. So I went to look at the original article. There&rsquo;s a photo of the author.</p>
<p>No further questions.</p>

<p>For crissakes, do we need celluloid heroes THAT BAD?</p>

<p>This is the same line they used against conservatives about communism in the 50&rsquo;s.  What it really says is, quit noticing and go back to sleep the pod people aren&rsquo;t finished yet.</p>
<p>For the tiny minority of people here who notice something is wrong there is a huge majority still lost.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what ever happened to those communists in the state dept. that escaped detection when the avalanche fell on McCarthy?</p>

<p>The video and book publishing business - and selling tobacco, is something we are still good at. The same can&rsquo;t be said of the car industry anymore, for one. Perhaps once again the USA can be the leader when it comes to political ideas?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Marvel at the huge over-representation of Blacks and Hispanics. Notice the same phenomenon in movies, sports, music, cartoons, books, educational materials, government legislation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Also notice the constant activism that these same institutions are not doing Enough to show minorities, and only &#8216;minorities&rsquo;, in abundant numbers and in a positive light.</p>

		<p>Yuck! That is the last time I ever watch a white guilt/noble savage porn flick. I am sick and tired of the constant denigration of whites and western civilization. How come we rarely see a film that celebrates whites and our achievements? As pointed out by other commenters, the only reason the Na&rsquo;Vi were able to defeat the humans was because of the assistance of human traitors. In real life, many revolutionary figures such as Nelson Mandela, Gandhi, W.E.B Dubois, Mugabe, etc, received their greatest education from white institutions. Without western thought and ideas, they would not have been able to successfully articulate and espouse revolutionary ideals. Oh, and I should probably mention that without the horrible harm caused to the environment by industrialization and technological advancement, James Cameron wouldn&rsquo;t have had the technology necessary to create his masterpiece. On a final note, what disturbs me is the fact that there are many treacherous, Na&rsquo;Vi loving human types in the white world. For all our railing against blacks, treacherous whites are far worse. </p>

		<p>So, the &#8216;whites&rsquo; in the movie are racist standins for cowboys and imperialists, and the &#8216;blue&rsquo;  Na&rsquo;Vi equate to people of color and are noble creatures of wisdom and caring, and this is all seen as proof of real racism in the here and now, against people of color.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Think of it this way. Avatar is a fantasy about ceasing to be white, giving up the old human meatsack to join the blue people, but never losing white privilege&#8221;.</p>
<p>The lesson here might be, even if you are a &#8216;race traitor&rsquo;, and somehow even turn completely blue, you&rsquo;ll always be tainted by mystical &#8216;white privilege&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I too have noticed this disturbing theme of the movie, and which was noted by others throughout many of these comments &hellip; that it is noble, decent, and good to betray your people by standing against your own evil kind in solidarity with a virtuous, persecuted minority group.  We are given the idea that most whites\Caucasians are no good, but that there are among them A FEW  good and decent ones who are redeemable, and that you are encouraged to be one of those few decent ones by betraying your own and going over to the other side.  They exhort you to be sort of a &#8220;Righteous Caucasian&#8221;, so to speak. </p>
<p>But the only &#8220;Righteous Caucasian&#8221; is one who defects and goes with the other side;  he would never support his own. And this is presented as something that is admirable and virtuous. On the other hand, supporting your own group is presented as immoral and contemptible.  (Unless you are a designated minority, of course!)</p>
<p>Imagine the effect this constant drum-beat has on young minds! No wonder our youth are so alienated and confused.</p>

		<p>The problem with this anti-white/&#8221;feel-good&#8221; movies, is that no matter what whites do, we are still hated and constantly harranged by liberals and racist non-whites.  If we ignore them, we&rsquo;re racists.  but once we do help them, we are considered to be condescending and &#8220;you think we need help, because you&rsquo;re white and yo&rsquo; betta&rsquo; than us, right?&#8221;  </p>

		<p>I just saw the movie tonight. The special effects are its only asset. The acting is poor, the characters are cartoonish stereotypes and the story is both boring and utterly predictable. At approx three hours it is way too long. Many scenes are simply ludicrous. No way would I recommend it to anyone.</p>

		<p>What I find amazing in Avatar, like so many other futuristic movies, is that, there should be any white people left period.<br>
With present demographic trends, there is a good possibility that there won&rsquo;t be any white people good or bad left on this planet, especially any that would have blue eyes and blond hair as seen amongst some in the movie. And of course, no white people, no civilization capable of going to to another planet.</p>
