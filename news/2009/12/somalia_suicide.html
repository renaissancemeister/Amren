<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8406886.stm">Somalia Suicide Bomber &#8216;Was From Denmark&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, December 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A suicide bomber who killed at least 22 people at a graduation in Somalia was brought up in Denmark, officials say.</p>
<p>Somali Information Minister Dahir Gelle told the BBC that the bomber&rsquo;s parents, who live in Copenhagen, identified their son&rsquo;s body from photographs.</p>
<p>Reports say he left Somalia when he was a child and spent 20 years in Denmark, before returning to Somalia last year.</p>
<p>He reportedly joined the hard-line Islamist group al-Shabab  &mdash;  although they have previously denied the attack.</p>
<p>Al-Shabab and other radical Islamist groups control much of the country.</p>
<p>The Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) also says the bomber was from Denmark, according to local media.</p>
<p>The Copenhagen Post quoted PET as saying the man was in his 20s and was &#8220;a Somali citizen who had residence in Denmark&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;As PET has indicated numerous times in the past, there are people with ties to Denmark who have gone through militant Islamic training and radicalisation and who are involved in terror-related activities in several countries, including in Somalia,&#8221; a PET statement said, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>The bombing took place at a graduation for medical students on 3 December in one of the few parts of the capital, Mogadishu, which is controlled by the government.</p>
<p>The students had been graduating from Benadir University, which was set up in 2002 to train doctors to replace those who had fled overseas or been killed in the civil war.</p>
<p>Three ministers were among the dead.</p>
<p>Al-Shabab, which wants to enforce a strict version of Islamic law in Somalia, is accused of having links to al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>It has previously carried out several suicide bombings on government targets  &mdash;  but it has usually claimed responsibility immediately.</p>
<p>Somalia has had no effective government for almost 20 years.<br>

		<p>You can take the boy out of the country, but you can&rsquo;t take the country out of the boy.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it comforting to know we now have large populations of these people within our midst?  I mean except for the ones who travel back and forth to the old country for supplies and training. </p>
<p>I know a couple of them who have finally learned how to flush a toilet.  I wonder if they would be considered &#8220;gifted?&#8221; </p>
<p>Janet Napolitano considers them harmless, of course.  Instead she issued an edict to report all suspicious tea party advocates and Sarah Palin supporters to Homeland Security.  Brilliant strategy and policy.</p>

		<p>America has ceased being the America I loved.</p>
<p> All I see is nonwhites EVERYWHERE and I am supposed to love being displaced in what was once a White man&rsquo;s land? Anyway it was set up to be just that, but we have been lied to for so long about the Founders intent, that one would think they really were for a Diversified USA with nonwhites and Whites living together peacefully. Who in their right mind could ever fall for that lie? Seems like most of the White people in America today sure have, doesn&rsquo;t it? </p>

		<p>If you ever let them into your country you will never have this sort of problem. </p>
<p>Liberals feel they don&rsquo;t have a right to say no.  You wonder how many of the victims supported immigration from countries like Somalia. </p>

<p>  Your right! Our liberal elites are far more suspicious of blue collar and middle class white Americans than they are of any threat from the Third World. They refuse to consider any executive action that could be interpreted as racist  &mdash;  the Major Hasan affair is only the most recent example. </p>

<p>Right! Exactly! The Danes are just so open-minded and tolerant and have such a wonderful welfare state and they want to go to Somali restaurants every so often and eat goat, etc.</p>
<p>And now that the problem has manifested itself, NO ONE seems to know what to do other than stay the course, where ever the course leads to [infamy!]. Holger Dansk, we need you. Holger Dansk is the so called mythological Dane from the period of the Dark Ages that sleeps as does Arthur and will awaken when  Denmark and the Danish way is threatened.</p>
