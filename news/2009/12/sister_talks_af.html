		<p>This was certainly a unfortunate circumstance. However, the fact is that the local news here in Pittsburgh reported that the elderly man, Mr.Jenkins made several racially pronounced slurs to Mr.Washington. </p>
<p>While Mr. Washigton should have been man enough to ignore Mr. Jenkins, especially given his age. The fact is that I can see why he might have became enraged at having experienced such disrespectful bigoted behavior.</p>

		<p>Of course there&rsquo;s no way to actually confirm he assaulted this   elderly man because he&rsquo;s white, but in all probability it gave him reason not to hold back.</p>
<p>Beating on the elderly because of racial or ethnic animosity is a no-go zone and entirely off limits. </p>
<p>Elderly abuse is already a punishable crime. Put this cretin in jail where he belongs with his other brutha&rsquo;s. Maybe I should say back in jail, he&rsquo;s probably been locked up before.</p>

They either roam in gangs and pick on the defenseless or if only one of them they will pick on an old White man or a woman&hellip;Real brave you are&hellip;.Yep, they should really be taught to have racial pride alright.

		<p>My stepfather, who was almost 80 at the time, and about 5 or so years ago had the same problem in a movie theatre.  He was sitting there doing nothing, and a black man tried to pick a fight with him and even followed him out when the movie was over. </p>
<p>This is uncalled for, white, black, brown, orange or purple.  We need to respect our elders.  </p>

		<p> When I read that the thug&rsquo;s last name was &#8220;Washington,&#8221; I knew he had to be black. The last White Washington I knew of was George. And why was the AP so careful to make no mention of race in its reports on this disgraceful attack? You know that if a younger White man had decked a 72-year-old black in that way, there would be a national uproar over it.</p>

		<p>Jason:</p>
<p>I suspicion if the TV news in Pittsburgh said it, that is because the black suspect is using that excuse.  It&rsquo;s now a common ghetto trick for a black criminal suspect who is accused of doing something bad to a white person to say that the white person used a racial slur.  Totally bogus, of course, but they wouldn&rsquo;t be doing it if it didn&rsquo;t work.  And it does work, usually to reduce the severity of the prison sentence or extricate them from the death house if Murder 1st is involved.</p>
<p>And why would a 72-year old white man yell a racial slur at a black man significantly younger and more physically capable than himself?</p>

<p>Both the democratic party AND the republican party are scams to provide the illusion of choice, while those who run everything behind the scenes control both parties.</p>

<p>I must agree with Question Diversity. Washington, facing legal retribution, probably played the old race card in the hopes of some leniency. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not my fault officer, the old white man called me the &#8216;N&rsquo; word and before you knew it my fist was in his face. Poor me.&#8221;</p>
<p>QD also raises the point why would an elderly man provoke an attack from someone younger and stronger? It doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Once again, the media is pandering to the liberal, Marxist agenda of the times.<br>
 <br>
Blacks and non-whites are always beating and attacking the aged and frail. Remember Pedro Martinez attacking the aged Don Zimmer on national television a couple of years ago? These people have no shame or any sense of decorum whatsoever. </p>
<p>Mr. Jenkins is a retiree that must work as a greeter at Wal-Mart in order to supplement his pension. Perhaps, during his working life if he wasn&rsquo;t taxed into penury to support the welfare roles (which I&rsquo;m sure Washington was a frequent member) he might have enough savings for a more worry free and dignified retirement. </p>

		<p>The only person claiming racial epithets were used is Mr. Washington. Witnesses say the elderly Mr. Jenkins said nothing provocative. Nothing. But like other blacks under lock and key, when Washington gets to court, he&rsquo;ll no doubt state loudly that Jenkins called him every name under the sun, starting and ending with the dreaded &#8220;n&#8221; word. </p>

<p>The GOP is dead as we all know, but if they were to rebuild they need to address the following in their platform:</p>
<p>1. Address black on white crime</p>
<p>2. No more affirmative action.  </p>
<p>3. Freedom of association - no more forced integration</p>
<p>4. No more special hate crime laws that only apply to protected groups</p>
<p>If they would use that platform, they will win.</p>

		<p>I do tend to get combative in my comments at times, but I&rsquo;ll venture to say that we Whites are going to have to get a whole lot more combative before it&rsquo;s all over.  Even if it is true that Mr. Jenkins had made racially inflamatory comments to Washington, verbal provocation is no excuse.  Of course, as has been pointed out above, the PC prosecutors will use this as a way of lessening the criminal charges against a Black in a Black-on-White case of assault and battery (or even first-degree murder for that matter).  I&rsquo;d also make so bold as to say that if Mr. Jenkins were a relative of mine, I&rsquo;m just old fashioned enough that I might not wait for the cops and the courts to render &#8220;justice&#8221;.  I might find it necessary to have a little talk with Washington myself in my attempt to convince him never again to go around hitting elderly people.  What is it going to take for Whites to open their eyes to what is going on?  How much longer must we be tread upon before we take some decisive action?</p>
<p>&#8220;And they shall beat their ploughshares into swords and their pruning hooks into spears.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>Here in NYC a mutant was just sentenced to 75 years for robbing and assaulting a 101 year old woman. It was called a hate crime because of the victim&rsquo;s age, of course the fact she was White was not mentioned. As this bum is only 47 I can just see in 15 or 20 years a future moronic Governor commuting his sentence ala Huckabee. All these long sentence&rsquo;s and Life Without Parole mean absolutetly nothing. Oh did I mention the race of the perp? Check him out on page 29 of the NY Post of 12/03/09.</p>

<p>What does pronunciation have to do with it?  Do you actually believe that a septuagenarian hurled racial insults at some black man?  If so, do you believe that there was no reason for it, or perhaps that this makes this vicious act of physical brutality acceptable in the least?</p>

		<p>Did you listen to his sister in the video?  No righteous anger.   No crying for justice.  Why couldn&rsquo;t she state the obvious and that he was attacked because he was White?  These pathetic attitudes on the part of Whites are what let these people continue doing what they&rsquo;re doing.  &#8220;We&rsquo;ll get him through this&#8221;.  As long as White have these forgiving attitudes these kind of attacks will continue.  As a matter of fact they&rsquo;re going to get worse, much worse.  All a White person needs to do is look the wrong way at a Black and they cry racism.  How many more White people are going to be attacked, mugged, raped, and murdered before some semblance of racial consciousness re-appears in Whites?</p>

		<p>This one reminds me of the one at Kent state, in that, we shouldn&rsquo;t expect a racial awakening. The media will cover instead a &#8216;real&rsquo; hate crime, or an episode like the Jenna 6 or Beer-gate in Massachusetts or Tiger Woods even, and sometimes the victim even dies so don&rsquo;t expect the story to travel much farther.</p>

		<p>I have to say, when it comes to sucker punching, it seems to be part of black culture.  For whites, there is stigma attatched to those who sucker punch, or punch a women or punch the diabled.  It is considered disgraceful.  But among blacks it is very common to hit women, sucker punch, attack the elderly, etc.   There just seems to be no shame or embarrassment.</p>
<p>Also cold-cocking someone.  When whites fight they instinctively know not to permanently hurt the other guy.  Whites fighting usually results in pushing, a quick take down, punching, but no permanent brain damage or disfiguring unless it&rsquo;s by accident.  Blacks, however, use bricks, rocks, bashing that results in permanent brain damage to the victim and disfiguring.  THey just don&rsquo;t seem to understand proportionality.</p>
<p>I would never let a black guy get up in my face.  I would keep him at a safe distince and if they move to close take that as a sign he is about to strike and be ready.  </p>

Exactly how does a mere insult (probably in response to a blatant provocation anyway) justify assault and battery of an elderly man?  </p>
<p>Blacks enjoy exaggerating harm &#8220;done&#8221; to them so they can justify committing acts of far greater harm.  Read up on the narcissist personality type:  I&rsquo;d say a good 80% of that race are criminal narcissists in varying degrees.    </p>

<p>Jason, I have seen NO reports of that. </p>
<p>IN FACT ALL THE REPORTS I&rsquo;VE SEEN CONTRADICT WHAT YOU&rsquo;VE SAID: hey assert the suspects says he did not punch Mr. Jenkins (even though the cops have him on videotape doing just that), NOT that Mr. Washington is saying that Mr. Jenkins is saying anything. </p>
<p>If there are no reports that Mr. Jenkins used any slurs, THEN you are making up a lie in order to blame the victim here. </p>
<p>WHY? </p>

<p>Check the video, there was no time for an exchange of words here. </p>
<p>The question is: why are you lying?</p>

<p>I had a friend with one leg get attacked once. He was just minding his own business when someone claimed he uttered a slur and beat him up. </p>
<p>Of course, we know the real reason he was attacked: he was a cripple. </p>
<p>Jason, what&rsquo;s up with this? What&rsquo;s up with making up these lies to justify these assaults? Do you talk about this around the dinner table with other blacks? Or is it just something that comes naturally to you? </p>

		<p>Jason, I don&rsquo;t know if you are a troll, doing a great imitation of black thinking or you are for real.</p>
<p>But let me assume the latter.</p>
<p>First, the news is not reporting racial slurs as fact; they are reporting &#8220;allegations&#8221; of racial slurs, &#8220;allegations&#8221; by the perpetrator.  That is a very big distinction.  </p>
<p>As far as rage, blacks seem to have no clue that they in fact enrage whites, Koreans, Hispanics, Cubans and everyone else they come in contact with, but that is no excuse for committing violent assault.</p>

<p>If in fact this is true, one must wonder how this washington guy was behaving prior to being called out on it.<br>
_________________________________________________</p>
<p>Correct Sir. That is part of journalism. Finding out the facts of the story. As you said, if indeed Mr. Jenkins actually did call him racial slurs, then are we supposed to believe that there was no reason for such language? That&rsquo;s not how things work. There&rsquo;s always something that starts an altercation. Interestingly, many people aren&rsquo;t equipped intellectually to look in depth at things. In this particular case, all many people can deal with is that there were racial remarks and that&rsquo;s the end of the story. Same with the &#8220;reporter&#8221; as well. He/she is most likely not too smart and can&rsquo;t go beyond surface appearances. This is the way things are now in our dumbed down country unfortunately.</p>

		<p>The reason for this crime is obvious:</p>
<p>The black is a radicalized political terrorist.  He most likely is either Nation of Islam, Black Footsoldier, Black Panther, or some other affiliated black nationalist mob.  Just another version of the Seattle cop shooter without the gun.  </p>
<p>This is a growing problem in America that most whites are oblivious too.  A genocidal movement inspired in part by South Africa is now underway in America at a very undeveloped level.  It is being fostered through the hip hop and other street cultures.  It is going to get worse.  The epidemic of horrible rapes is also part of this.  These are acts of terrorism, and they are being encouraged by both leftist elements and Islamic elements.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This was certainly a unfortunate circumstance. However, the fact is that the local news here in Pittsburgh reported that the elderly man, Mr.Jenkins made several racially pronounced slurs to Mr.Washington.&#8221; </p>
<p>  I&rsquo;m not sure where you are getting this Jason. It wasn&rsquo;t mentioned in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette. The attack appeared &#8220;random&#8221; Here&rsquo;s what they said:</p>
<p>By Jerome L. Sherman, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette<br>
&#8220;A North Versailles man has been charged with assault after punching a 72-year-old Wal-Mart &#8220;greeter&#8221; in the face yesterday, according to police.</p>
<p>Paul Washington, 55, is accused of walking up to Thomas Jenkins and striking him as he stood at the entrance to the store on Route 30. Mr. Jenkins, of McKeesport, fell to the ground.</p>
<p>A police sergeant was nearby at the time of the incident, and he arrested Mr. Washington as the man tried to get into his car and drive away.</p>
<p>North Versailles police Chief James Comunale said the attack appeared &#8220;random.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Jenkins suffered broken facial bones, and he was taken to UPMC Presbyterian for treatment.</p>
<p>In addition to the assault charge, Mr. Washington has been charged with harassment, disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, and criminal mischief. He is being held at the Allegheny County Jail.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Reply to &#8220;Jason&#8221;:</p>
<p>So let me see if I got this straight. You say (without citing any sources of offering any supportive evidence) that a 72 year old man, presumably frail, certainly old enough to know better then to ask for trouble, and presumably needing to work into his retirement years is going to be foolish enough to senselessly provoke an attack from someone almost two decades younger and much bigger then himself? And then having &#8220;enraged&#8221; his black attacker pays no attention to him and allows himself to be knocked out cold with a cowardly sucker punch? You may be the most pathetic troll on the interent.</p>

Did you listen to his sister in the video? No righteous anger. &#8220;No crying for justice. Why couldn&rsquo;t she state the obvious and that he was attacked because he was White? These pathetic attitudes on the part of Whites are what let these people continue doing what they&rsquo;re doing. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get him through this&rdquo;. As long as White have these forgiving attitudes these kind of attacks will continue. As a matter of fact they&rsquo;re going to get worse, much worse. All a White person needs to do is look the wrong way at a Black and they cry racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Awakened,<br>
I listened to it and has the same reaction as you. I am so <br>
tired of hearing these pusillanimous Whites taking all this in stride. And then there is always the rhetorical question about how anyone could do this to an old man, a beautiful young woman, an innocent child etc. etc..  As I&rsquo;ve said many times on this site, we&rsquo;ve become the Wildebeest who watch one of their own being torn to pieces by the predators on the African plains and then return to their grazing while the predators feed on the carcass. <br>
The prey animals seem to recognize and accept their inevitable lot in life and Whites have been conditioned to accept that same lot.<br>
As for David #24, yes these things happen both ways but if you look at the stats, there is no comparison.</p>

<p>I must agree with Question Diversity. Washington, facing legal retribution, probably played the old race card in the hopes of some leniency. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault officer, the old white man called me the &lsquo;N&rsquo; word and before you knew it my fist was in his face. Poor me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have had a slur or two directed toward me over the years, mostly by blacks. My way of handling it is to remember that, upon awakening the next morning, I would be the same man I was before being spoken to in that manner, and that the one doing the speaking would remain the same as he is, as well.</p>

		<p>Please Please Please stop thinking of he Republican party as conservative. Regan and both Bush&rsquo;s were big government spenders. They opened the borders, &#8216;policed&rsquo; the world in Granada, Panama, Somalia and Iraq. Regan granted amnesty to the illegals, did nothing to send back the 100,000 criminals that entered just a few months before his presidency. </p>

  I was born and bred in Cameroon but one principle is shared by African culture in its universality:respect for old people or the elderly.In Pittsburgh where I attended college and during my stay in the United States,I have learnt that the values of not hitting women and deferring to them when leaving elevators just to name a few.Mr. Washington&rsquo;s action is not only to be condemned but is an abomination.The elderly deserve our protection irrespective of their race,economic status or otherwise.Had Mr. Washington&rsquo;s action taken place in my natvie Cameroon,the population would have taken matters into their own hands by admininistering mob justice.In hausa,we say &#8216;BABUH&rsquo; which means hell No!Babuh Mr. Washington.I wish the 72 year old victim a speedy recovery.</p>

		<p>Shopping at Wal Mart isn&rsquo;t dangerous, but there&rsquo;s a trick to it.  Go in the late evening, after the crowds are gone.  If you&rsquo;re there for a few items, and the lines at the registers are long, pay at the electronics department.</p>
<p>That said, I also carry pepper spray and take absolutely nothing laying down.</p>
