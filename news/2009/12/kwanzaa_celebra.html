<h1>Kwanzaa Celebrations Continue, But Boom Is Over</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Megan K. Scott, Google News, December 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Four years ago, Evita Broughton celebrated Kwanzaa for the first time with her family  &mdash;  lighting a candle each night and discussing the respective principle.</p>
<p>But she hasn&rsquo;t celebrated the holiday since.</p>
<p>&#8220;It felt like a school project that lasted seven nights,&#8221; said Broughton, 27, of Marietta, Ga. &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t feel like I had that connection. I tried to share my experiences with others but no one else was celebrating it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kwanzaa, which runs from Dec. 26 to Jan. 1, may be a mainstream holiday with greeting cards, postage stamps and public celebrations, but experts say its popularity is receding.</p>
<p>It will not be getting a boost from the first family. The Obamas do not personally celebrate Kwanzaa, according to White House aides, though a written message from the president is likely, in keeping with the practice of his most recent predecessors, Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The big boom in Kwanzaa came during its first two decades, according to Keith Mayes, author of &#8220;Kwanzaa: Black Power and the Making of the African-American Holiday Tradition.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he said participation has leveled off. Based on his research, he estimates a half-million to 2 million people in the U.S. celebrate Kwanzaa, out of about 40 million Americans identified by the U.S. Census as black, including those who are multiracial.</p>
<p>Mayes, an assistant professor of African American &amp; African Studies at the University of Minnesota, says the black power movement was the &#8220;engine&#8221; for Kwanzaa, and the holiday faded as the movement receded. {snip}</p>
<p>Although Kwanzaa started here, it has become a Pan-African holiday. The African American Cultural Center places the number of those who observe Kwanzaa worldwide at 30 million, but even that is a small fraction of the hundreds of millions of people of African descent all over the world.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Camille Zeigler, president of the Atlanta Alumnae Chapter for Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc., said many of the girls who are first-timers at the black sorority&rsquo;s annual Kwanzaa celebration know very little about the holiday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Broughton said when she told black friends she was observing Kwanzaa, she had to give them a lesson on its meaning. They had heard of it, but didn&rsquo;t know anyone who celebrated it.</p>
<p>Yvette Braswell, 37, of Studio City, Calif., who celebrated Kwanzaa a couple of times with her family, said once she moved to the Los Angeles area nine years ago, she struggled to find others in her inner circle who did.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some blacks, though, rejected the concept of Kwanzaa all along, considering it a pagan holiday and taking issue with its founder, a black nationalist and ex-con  &mdash;  he was convicted of torturing two women.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, founder of BOND (Brotherhood Organization of a New Destiny) and author of &#8220;SCAM: How the Black Leadership Exploits Black America&#8221; believes the holiday is racist. He advocates for blacks to see themselves as Americans  &mdash;  not African-Americans, thus no separate holiday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get rid of it,&#8221; said Peterson, who is black. &#8220;Reject it completely. Just as we would do if a white racist came up with a false holiday to celebrate whiteness.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the need for African people to be connected to their culture hasn&rsquo;t gone away, said Chimbuko Tembo, assistant director of the center. She said she hears from people all over the world who want to celebrate what it means to be of African descent.</p>

		<p>I think the reason why Kwanzaa has fizzled out, save a few black nationalists and supremacists, is simple.  I think most blacks assumed that an 8-day celebration meant 8 times as many gifts.  When it didn&rsquo;t work out that way, then Kwanzaa lost its appeal.  The reason I think that is that I once overheard a mother-daughter pair of black women (about 8 or 9 years ago), say that they weren&rsquo;t happy with their Christmas present quality and quantity.  So next year, &#8220;We&rsquo;re switching to Kwanzaa.  Since it&rsquo;s got more days, maybe we&rsquo;ll get more gifts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s disappointing to many of us who would like to see blacks come up to the white equivalent of everything, so they can become a permanent, more distinct group from whites.</p>
<p>Having their own schools, holidays, language and culture seems to be in the kind of half-way-but-not-quite-there-stage, like everything else black.  They&rsquo;re separate from us in many ways, but it&rsquo;s really no good until they&rsquo;re away from us entirely.</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t a group of them come up with a movement designed to keep blacks separate in all things?  I certainly would contribute to it, and I think many other whites would as well.</p>

		<p>Please join with me to Restore Kwanzaa, the original, vibrant, authentic, modern expression of afrovoodoo in America! The more time afros spend dressed like african kings and queens, banging on drums, and away from our Christian churches, the better. Afro self segregation is what we need and applaud.</p>

		<p>I remember a few years ago a local television station (with slow news in the week between Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s) ran a public interest piece on a Kwanzaa celebration at a local black church. Looking out over the half full sanctuary I noticed that it was all black except for one very liberal looking White family. It was almost laughable to see these people who obviously drove from the more affluent part of town to the dangerous Black area to show how multicultural and tolerant they were. </p>

		<p>&#8220;kwanzaa&#8221; was a &#8220;holiday&#8221; made up by the feds (fbi) in the 1960s in order to keep tabs on the black radical political movements and their members.<br>
It&rsquo;s funny how these fools celebrate it as a legitimate &#8220;holiday.  Maybe it is good for business?</p>

		<p>Despite its dubious origins, I can sympathize with the need many American blacks feel to have a culture of their own.  They don&rsquo;t really have their own language, religion or traditions so I see nothing wrong with them taking steps to create their own distinct culture - including their own holidays.  If they ever really do succeed in creating a meaningful culture of their own, it is possible that this might curb their violent tendencies and we would all benefit as a result.  Wishful thinking I know&hellip;</p>

		<p>HA! More people celebrate &#8220;Festivus&#8221; - a one-off humorous spoof from the Seinfeld show - than Kwanzaa. Maybe Kwanzaa would have been more successful if it were treated, from the start, as a joke - a purely racist joke, but a joke never-the-less. That way, it might at least be fun.</p>

		<p>Ah yes, Kwanzaa&hellip;one of the more perfect embodiments of the black preference for symbolism over substance in all things, even their own holidays! But more critically, let&rsquo;s face it, Kwanzaa always appealed most to the guilty white liberals and elites who saw it as a prime opportunity to further erode white tradition, while simultaneously supporting thinly-veiled radical black nationalism dressed up as a benevolent holiday. But schemes like this have not always gone as the elites planned, as blacks like to play the victim, feign offense at everything, and talk a good game about &#8220;african american&#8221; culture and such. But when all is said and done, all blacks really care about and want is what we whites have, and what we whites do - and they just want to be sure they do it and have it too. All the rest is just so much noise!</p>

		<p>So in other words, it was a phony holiday, created for phony political purposes with a phony following? Not a big surprise there. In fact, I think the white elites are more willing to keep Kwanzaa alive than most blacks (witness the US postage stamps recognizing the &#8220;holiday&rsquo;), but the white elites have been influencing black opinion for so long that&rsquo;s also not a surprise.</p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t blacks adopt Festivus? Makes about as much sense as Kwanzaa. If more of them became God-fearing Christians, crime would go down, they would develop self-esteem and purpose in life, and there would be more of a sense of community. Black communities with a strong church following are more cohesive.</p>

Why shouldn`t we follow his example, celebrate Kwanza and only torture a few women.To make it a perfect Kwanza, I urge all white people to kill all other white people except pretty blonde females under 25.

		<p>The libs do appear do be giving up on Kwanza. The local rag, The Cleveland Plain Dealer, pushed Kwanza for years. Stories of blacks dressed up in African garb celebrating the various days, Ogoma, Mabouto, or some nonsense like that. This year not a word.<br>

		<p>&ldquo;Mayes, an assistant professor of African American &amp; African Studies at the University of Minnesota, says the black power movement was the &lsquo;engine&rsquo; for Kwanzaa, and the holiday faded as the movement receded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And even at that point, when the black power &ldquo;engine&rdquo; was in full throttle, did a majority of blacks ever celebrate this absurd pseudo-holiday? My guess is that blacks in the United States, never exceeded 25% as a group in &ldquo;enjoying&rdquo; Kwanzaa festivities and that is being generous. After all, there are just not enough &ldquo;African-American Studies&rdquo; professors, Black Panther rejects, and white Marxist idiots, to go around for it to have cemented with the larger &ldquo;comoonity.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In the end, blacks may consciously hate us, but subconsciously they all are driven by a longing jealously within that hatred. That longing jealously, that nagging &ldquo;ambition,&rdquo; is to be white. Thus, while many of their overt actions are obviously to be despised; their more covert &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; expressions tend to reflect, or even emulate (to a point) what &ldquo;whitey be doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within that framework, they are and will remain at least nominally Christian!</p>

		<p>kwanzaa appears to me as a &#8216;copycat&rsquo; to hanukkah in many ways with the candles, about the same number of days/nights, gifts, close proximity to other &#8216;white&rsquo; holidays such as christmas&hellip;etc. <br>
i have indeed heard many blacks refer to christmas as a &#8221;white&#8221; holiday. they point out that not only is santa white, but his beard is as well&hellip;and it takes place during winter where in many places, everything is blanketed by snow which is&hellip;.you guessed it, white. how horrible. </p>
<p>additionally, i have always felt that not only was it a &#8221;made- up&#8221; holiday by a black pervert and criminal, but it was literally created by him with an agenda to take away and attempt to steal the spotlight away from christmas and hanukkah which are literally thousands of years old and have deep, ancient religious and cultural significance to whites. while whites have always welcomed blacks to celebrate christmas, kwanzaa has from its inception meant to be an exclusively black holiday.</p>
<p>it has always amazed me how white liberals either cannot or will not come to these realizations.</p>

		<p>I guess it is typical black that when inventing a holiday to celebrate their heritage they pick the wrong heritage. Thanks to Hollywood Kiswahili, which is only spoken on the coast of East Africa, is the only African language ever used in movies.Bravo, our African-American friends have found their home. Unfortunately, it was the wrong address.  Had they used Ashanti or one of the languages spoken from their origin, some 4,000 miles to the west, it might have made some sense.</p>

<p>I have never seen such a thing.  The only time I become aware that there is even a church in the &#8216;Black communities&rsquo; is when they are rallying to stop all the local black on black crime.

		<p>8 said &#8220;Now if only MLK day would meet the same fate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep MLK day, Black History Monty, Juneteenth, and whatever else they want, let&rsquo;s give it to them. The consequences are in our favor. The more obnoxious and off putting and illogical it is to celebrate explicit afro race feeling and privilege while denying race feeling and celebration for White Citizens, the better.  The illogic and injustice seep into the minds of White Youth.  They see afros enjoying privileges that they can&rsquo;t, and that injustice turns them in favor of their own kind and away from race privileged afros. These privileged afros are not sweet angels, and our White Youth are smart enough within their natures to make the connection between afro favored status and afro violence.</p>
<p>For those whites in name only who have &#8220;transcended&#8221; their whiteness through the SPLC&rsquo;s tolerance teaching, then we couldn&rsquo;t care less. Let them make all the mixed babies they want. If they are weak enough to accept coerced tolerance, then we don&rsquo;t want their confused and weaker white genes continuing to embarrass our gene pool. Let them afro mate themselves out of existence, leaving only the strong, true White Citizen bloodlines for our posterity. As we become minoritized in our own country, our descendants will need to be a mighty race, not emasculated.</p>
<p>In other words, let&rsquo;s let the afros distinguish themselves as different from us as much as possible, and MLK day is one of those ways. The more we White Citizens encounter unearned African American race privilege, the better. We certainly can&rsquo;t put a stop to it, so might as well use it in our favor. </p>
<p>Do you hate rap and hip hop music as much as I do? Praise it, for it shows the afros in their natural state of thuggery as fashion and intimidation as style. Shows them angry and licentious! We need our afros fully thuggish and intimidating, and not deceptively imitating us Celts and Angles and Saxons and Norsemen by wearing suits and ties. Disgusting dreadlocks? The longer and woolier, the better. Baggy pants pulled down past the butt, always better.  First names that are unpronounceable in the Englishman&rsquo;s tongue, wonderful. Ebonics gibberish, the best!</p>

<p>With all due respect, Christianity, or religion of any sort is not going to magically transform the African into a pillar of the civilized community! Indeed, most American blacks ARE Christians, and have been for decades an decades&hellip;and we see how well that turned out. </p>
<p>The religion is ultimately only as good as those who invented and practice it.</p>

		<p>Wikipedia says</p>
<p>&#8220;Ron Karenga (born Ronald McKinley Everett on July 14, 1941, and also known as Ron Everett and as Maulana Karenga) is an African American author, political activist, and college professor best known as the creator of Kwanzaa. Karenga was active in the Black Power movement in the 1960s and 1970s and founded the black nationalist group US Organization which remains active to this day promoting Karenga&rsquo;s philosophy of Kawaida.[1] Kawaida is a set of principles based on Blackness. The principles are designed as parts Kwanzaa. A convicted felon, Karenga served time in prison in the early 1970s after being convicted of felony assault and false imprisonment. After leaving prison, he eventually became a professor at California State University, Long Beach in the Africana Studies department.[2]&#8221;</p>
<p>White Citizens unite in applauding his name change from Anglo Saxon &#8220;Ronald McKinley Everett&#8221; to afrovoodoo american &#8220;Ron Karenga or Maulana Karenga&#8221;.  All White Citizen McKinley Everetts can rejoice that their name is no longer applied to an afrovoodoo american. All White Citizens should demand that afrovoodoo americans surrender their unearned race privilege of having been given our grand European-English language names. They should all change to their true afrovoodoo names. The best afrovoodoo mothers are the ones who won&rsquo;t use Euro-English names for their afrovoodoo children who are born in American and benefit illegally from the White Man&rsquo;s 14th amendment. If you know any &#8220;African American&#8221; mothers who are about to drop another afrovoodoo baby onto the liabilities of our American polity, please send them this link so they will have afrovoodoo names to choose from and will be less tempted to use and malign one of ours. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ydhlz4x" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/ydhlz4x</a></p>
<p>If the moms to be are &#8220;kepp&rsquo;n it real&#8221;, they will choose &#8220;they baby name&#8221; from the Atlanta&rsquo;s thug 30 Deep gang.  Tamorris, Javorris, Tamarkus. </p>
<p>Next time an afrovoodoo thug robs, rapes, and murders a member of our White Citizen Community (today, tomorrow, Christmas morning, Easter?), if he is using an European-Anglo name, we should demand that the court legally change his name to his real afrovoodoo name as a normal part of the court proceedings. No afrovoodoo defendants should be tried for a crime against a white girl while using a white man&rsquo;s name. Change the names back to their original, and the whites on the jury will have their minds opened to the truth.</p>
<p>Next time you meet an afrovoodoo american who is using up one of our English names, refuse to talk to them until they admit their real afrovoodoo name to you. White:&#8221;What is your real name?&#8221; Afrovoodoo:&#8221;What do you mean? I just told you.&#8221; White:&#8221;No, I mean your African name, not your Euro-Anglo name. You aren&rsquo;t from Europe, you are African. What is your African name?&#8221; Or next time an afrovoodoo american complains about anything they deem offensive or racist, demand that they not use your White Citizen native English language when harrassing you. Tell them if they have a complaint, you want to hear it in their NATIVE TONGUE. If an afrovoodoo american won&rsquo;t speak to me in afrovoodooican or ebonics, I just can&rsquo;t trust him, because he&rsquo;s &#8220;acting white&#8221;, which insults all White Citizens. Afrovoodoo americans should act fully african.</p>
<p>Slavery had many tragedies, but giving to afrovoodoos our Euro-Anglo names was one of the worst.  As a first step in good faith Slavery Reparations negotiations, all the afrovooodos who won&rsquo;t go back to Mother Africa right now must surrender their Euro-Anglo names back to us and proclaim their true afrovoodoo names.</p>

		<p>Nobody outside of large urban inner cities would ever have heard of Kwanzaa if not for the white leftist media tryin to elevate it to the status of black Christmas. In fact, I believe it was part of the overall war on Christmas that heated up in the late &rsquo;90s. Of course, they didn&rsquo;t make much headway in stopping actual celebration but they came very close to purging the word Christmas entirely about five years ago.</p>

		<p>Liberal whites have tired of it, and blacks have lost interest in pushing it, so their little confederacy (of the dunces) dealing with Kwanzaa is headed for the ash heap of history.</p>

		<p>DiscoverTheNetwork reports this about &#8216;professor&rsquo; karenga&rsquo;s past (did Wikipedia?):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; A May 14, 1971, Los Angeles Times report of the victims&rsquo; testimony, which read: &#8216;The victims said they were living at Karenga&rsquo;s home when Karenga accused them of trying to [poison] him&hellip; . When they denied it, allegedly they were beaten with an electrical cord and a hot soldering iron was put in [one victim&rsquo;s] mouth and against her face. Police were told that one of [the other victim&rsquo;s] toes was placed in a small vise which was allegedly tightened by one of the defendants. The following day &hellip; Karenga, holding a gun, threatened to shoot both of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Convicted of felonious assault and false imprisonment, Mr. Karenga was sentenced in 1971 to up to 10 years in prison&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/yc34dkl </p>
<p>Would the LA Times dare to print that now?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;. Ron Karenga had [this] to say about Kwanzaa in the Washington Post: &#8216;People think it&rsquo;s African, but it&rsquo;s not. I came up with Kwanzaa because Black people wouldn&rsquo;t celebrate it if they knew it was American. Also, I put it around Christmas because I knew that&rsquo;s when a lot of Bloods are partying.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>One more fraud in the black community  &mdash;  MLK, Rosa Parks, Kwanzaa, Alex Haley&rsquo;s plagiarized Roots  &mdash;  ignored and covered up by the media, government and academia, presented in high school text books as heroes for fighting and winning against the genocidal White race.  These same textbooks have scant mention of the Founding Fathers or any White hero such as Daniel Boone.</p>
<p>If you present facts disputing the &#8216;achievements&rsquo; of these black heroes you will inevitably be branded as a Racist Nazi.</p>
