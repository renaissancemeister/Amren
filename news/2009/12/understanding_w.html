	<p>Understanding Whiteness in American History and Culture: Deconstructing White Privilege for the Reconstruction of an Anti-Racist White Identity (Online)</p>
<p>History XL M151C<br>
4.00 units</p>
<p>Eurocentric American history often masks the saliency of how the formation of Whiteness ultimately supports mechanisms of race and racism. This course outlines the historical development of Whiteness and critically analyzes the sociological results that stem from its birth. Segmented into three modules, the course provides a historical framework of the birth of Whiteness; explores Whiteness (namely, White Supremacy and White Privilege) and how they impact people of color and uphold racial hierarchy; and, in acknowledging that the relevance of history is inextricably tied to modern society, draws from liberatory, transformative, and emancipatory praxis, to engage in a REconstruction of anti-racist white racial identity. Throughout the course students are expected to critically engage in dialogue and identify and challenge their preconceived racial assumptions. {snip}<br>

		<p>OK, typical anti-white hate ranting.(There are probably hundreds of UCLA courses where the instructors spew the same garbage but it&rsquo;s not part of the course description.) It would be wrong anywhere, but especially wrong in an alleged university where students should be seeking the truth, and learning how to think, how to tell right from wrong. Put another way, it would be helpful for college students to be exposed to AmRen writing and New Century books, but we should not want a college class where students are indoctrinated in our thinking. We will gain more adherents just by exposing independent thinkers to our principles. Shoving any ideas down a student&rsquo;s throat is no good, and UCLA&rsquo;s &#8220;hate whitey&#8221; courses  seem to the definition of &#8220;no good.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Looks to me that this course will be conducted in one of many languages of white supremacy (English), at a university mainly founded and funded by whites (UCLA), and in what used to be the most prosperous white state in the most prosperous white country in history (California, USA).  To avoid even the slightest appearance of impropriety, they should move this course to the Congo.</p>

<p>Understanding Diversity in American History and Culture: Deconstructing Multicultural Genocidal Preoccupations for the Reconstruction of a Healthy White Racial Identity (Online)</p>
<p>History WX Y262Z</p>
<p>4.00 units</p>
<p> Diversity Worship as American history often masks the saliency of how the formation of Multicultural Propaganda ultimately supports the mechanisms of miscegenation and white racial genocide. This course outlines the historical Neo Marxist development of  Multiculturalism and critically analyzes the sociological results that stem from its birth. Segmented into three modules, the course provides a historical framework of the birth of Multiculturalism; explores Multiculturalism&rsquo;s Genocidal prerogatives (namely, Mass Third World Immigration Supremacy and Affirmative Action Privilege) and how they impact the white race and uphold a Marxist supported nonwhite racial hierarchy to dispossess whites in their own lands of traditional majority status; and, in acknowledging that the relevance of history is inextricably tied to modern society, draws from anti-liberatory, anti-transformative, and anti-emancipatory praxis, to engage in a Reconstruction of a healthy pro-white racial identity. Throughout the course students are expected to critically engage in dialogue and identify and challenge their preconceived multiracial and white guilt assumptions.</p>
<p>Boy, that would be a jolly class to teach!</p>

		<p>Colleges &amp; universities are at war with you White people. Don&rsquo;t ever let them fool you into giving to the alma mater. They will use your money to destroy you. UCLA alumni should boycott their alma mater and not give a penny to this PC institution. However they&rsquo;ll probably go on giving as usual. They may have cause to regret that someday. </p>
<p>Several years ago I saw a Philadelphia Inquirer headline regarding the fact that Penn St. U. was breaking its neck to make sure that a black student from Haiti received his degree before he went to prison for murder. He was convicted and sentenced, but they wanted to make sure he got his degree before he matriculated at State Penn. </p>
<p>I cut out the headline and was about to send it with a letter to Penn State (I had received an MBA from there a few years before) when a letter from the alumni association, soliciting funds, arrived. I simply attached my letter to the bounce back card and sent it back to the association with my statement that they&rsquo;d see hell freeze over before I&rsquo;d ever send them a dime.</p>
<p>I received a positively vicious and very threatening reply from the head of the alumni association informing me that I was way out of bounds for associating this incident with the good work of the association and the passionate drive to educate the world on the part of the university. I laughed and threw it into the trash. </p>

		<p>Our public schools are bearing their share of the burden of making sure our youngsters &#8220;understand whiteness&#8221;. All textbooks, for example, are produced with the aid comically elaborate (running to a hundred pages or more) &#8220;bias and sensitivity&#8221; guidelines.</p>
<p>Here is NYU research professor Diane Ravitich (Bush I asst. sect of education   &mdash;  - though a Democrat   &mdash;  - and later Clinton appointee to the National Assessment Governming Board) describing textbook giant McGraw-Hill&rsquo;s bias guidelines:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The MH [McGraw-Hill] guidelines express barely concealed rage against people of European ancestry. They deride European Americans for exploiting slaves, migrant workers, and factory labor; they excoriate the land rapacity of the pioneers and mock their so-called courage in fighting Native Americans: &lsquo;Bigots and Bigotry,&rsquo; say the guidelines, referring to European Americans, &lsquo;must be identified and discussed.&rsquo; European Americans, the guidelines suggest, were uniquely responsible for bigotry and exploitation in all human history &hellip;&rdquo; (p. 44, The Language Police, 2003)   </p>

		<p>This is classic Marxist technique: self-criticism, debasement before the group, loss of individuality and self-worth, use of cognitive dissonance to stifle dissent.<br>
All of the whiteness programs have a common denominator: neo- and diehard- Marxists with the standard agenda: destruction of the nation-state. With of course the usual motivation: a new age of peace and fulfillment following the dictatorship of the proletariat.<br>
Blah blah.<br>
But actually, although irony is not of interest to Marxists, irony is interested in them. Because, with a moment&rsquo;s thought, it becomes clear that there are NO Marxist states anymore&hellip;with the exception of the extraterrestrial country of North Korea.<br>
All others are, simply put, either neo-capitalist ( e.g. China) or neo-fascist (e.g. Russia). A case could be made that the Cuban Revolution has always been the catalyst for American Leftism, but that charisma is fading rapidly. Waves and waves of emigrants make it clear to all but the brain dead that no one wants to live there, really.<br>
So, the irony that seeks out the Left in this country asks them: who then are we evil white capitalists supposed to turn into?<br>
The most powerful country-to-be in the world, China, wants nothing to do with American-style leftism. They don&rsquo;t even want to be anti-racists, which is the litmus test for minimal social acceptability amonst the left. They are quite happy to be Han Chinese, thank you very much. They must be amazed at the perverse attraction the American Left has for techniques of the Cultural Revolution, an era in Chinese history that is absolutely abhorred.<br>
So I think the left is, frankly, dying. It is breathing alright; but it is not the heavy breathing of passion and life but of a comatose patient slipping away.</p>

		<p>You might as well go ahead and memorize that spiel. We have arrived at the moment when any white person who wants a job in government, religion, academia, or any other non profit, must talk like that in order to be considered. Just say you want to help society by &#8220;reconstructing racist white identity around anti racist social justice goals&#8221;, and you are golden.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure there will be lots of specialists and big words and subtle explanations&hellip;.. But perhaps the real reason whites have pogressed more than others, is because they are more progressive, {A tree is known by its fruit}. Competition doesn&rsquo;t rank very high in marxist paradigms for the same reason whites don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m all for sharing the world with the varied ranges of human types but I&rsquo;m not interested in being admired and congradulated by the losers of humanity for selling my culture and ancestors down the river. Incidentally ..I don&rsquo;t think whites are the end all. I truly believe the distinct human types add a completeness and richness to this cosmic miracle that would be otherwise be greatly diminished.</p>

		<p>How about a course on deconstructing academic privilege? Academics, especially in anthropology and sociology, claim to have scientific knowledge about race and the workings of society. The course would critically examine how this claimed knowledge is false and subverts the democratic rights of citizens. The course would provide an historical framework showing how a small cabal of Marxist professors took over the professional bodies regulating these academic disciplines to impose phony scientific claims to achieve political purposes. Students in the course will be challenged to think independently and reclaim their democratic rights.</p>

<p>Of all the lies in this course description, this is the biggest. Try informing the good professor that slavery was a universal institution first stopped by whites. Or mention that whites have to score 200-300 points higher on SATs than blacks just to get into the schools our ancestors built. Or the fact that almost all interracial violence in Amerika is black-on-white. Or bring up the monthly occurrences of hate crime hoaxes meant to demean and scapegoat whites.

It is death by small does of poison, or death by a thousand cuts.</p>
<p>First back in the 1960&rsquo;s the white people of America, which was actually America back then, were asked to give the blacks a small break and let them vote in the deep South and also stop killing innocent blacks.</p>
<p>Then I didn&rsquo;t think this was too much to asked, after all I lived in Ohio.  But as soon as one favor was granted another was asked.  Finally you see that the scheme wasn&rsquo;t to help out blacks, but it was a plan to end white America.</p>
<p>Each tablespoon of poison was followed by another: give voting rights, force integration, force bussing, confer Affirmative Action, stop systemic racism, end disparate impact, impose diversity &amp; diversity training, stop the N-word, the noose, xenophobia, and  homophobia, and currently it is kill white beauty and intelligence aka white privilege.  What is next on the agenda?   </p>
<p>Yes actually kill white people with government health care.   Old white people are totally useless.  They don&rsquo;t pay taxes and they subvert the anti-white plan by telling younger people white is good.<br>

		<p>The professor who teaches this class is a colonialist from the Philippines.   What other countries would allow a hate-filled foreign racist like her to vomit hatred over their children at tax-payer expense?  How many would even allow such a creature to remain in their country?   There&rsquo;s a direct connection between the ideology of genocide (and that&rsquo;s what it is) being hammered out by the white-hating racists who hold these university race chairs and the beatings in Denver and the shooting of the police in Washington.  If you stick a microphone in black gang bangers faces they spit back a bowdlerized version of what&rsquo;s being taught in these classes.

		<p>Our opinions are not &#8220;preconceived racial assumptions,&#8221; they are post-experience racial assumptions.  One trait of humans (at least the more intelligent humans) is the ability to derive generalities from observations.  When we see failure and social pathologies again and again and again from one group of people, then we tend to associate such people with those behaviors.  Why would anyone call that a &#8220;preconceived&#8221; assumption?  </p>

		<p>Looks to me when reading here that the &#8220;good ole USA&#8221; needs another Senator McCarthy to weed out the closet Marxists and while I know that, as in all campaigns they tend to go way over the top, how can the Marxists be stopped?  I&rsquo;ll bet some adherents do not even know that they are the unwitting tools of Marxists.</p>

		<p>The end result of Whiteness studies programs is NATIVE BORN WHITE MALES being hunted down and murdered by post-1965 hispanic,muslims,african and asian youth, NATIVE BORN WHITE WOMEN will be ganged raped for sport. This is what race-replacement means.</p>
<p>I Barack Obama had lost the election, young black  males would have gone on a murdering spree against WHITE BORN WHITE MALES. You don&rsquo;t believe it? Take a look at the news article at the top. Unfortunately, this is the only way millions of NATIVE BORN WHITE MALES will get the message to get out of sports stadiums and revolt aganst their race-replacement.</p>

		<p>I agree with Mark.  The liberal multiculturalists/social justice types don&rsquo;t seem to realize that other cultures have not produced or adopted the teachings of diversity, et al.</p>
<p>The other day there was an article on how African Americans are having a harder time than other groups to get job interviews.  The thought burst into my mind that there are so many businesses now owned by Asians and Latinos in this country - do blacks ever apply to those places?</p>
<p>Heck no.  When was the last time you ever, ever saw a black employee in an Asian or Latino owned firm?  Those two groups (also Arabs) never, ever hire blacks.</p>
<p>So the liberals are taking the dwindling number white owned businesses to task in this recession for not hiring enough black applicants, yet all other races and their hiring practices are ignored.</p>
<p>Since whites are a diminishing number in this country, and Asians and Latinos are the the ones who will replace us in this land, shouldn&rsquo;t the blacks, at least - for the sake of self-preservation - and the liberals who support them, start to take Asians and Latinos to task for not giving blacks the time of day?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t blacks with MBAs start their own businesses and hire other of their own people?  There are enough wealthy blacks in this land to start banks, investment firms, etc&hellip;  As a white male, by the way, what are my chances of being hired by a black-owned business?  </p>
<p>I had a black boss once (in a school) and he was the most racist person I have ever seen in my ENTIRE life.   He harrassed and/or drove out all the whites, Asians and Latinos and hired/coddled only other blacks to work in his school.</p>

<p>&#8220;Penn St. U. was breaking its neck to make sure that a black student from Haiti received his degree before he went to prison for murder.  I cut out the headline and was about to send it with a letter to Penn State (I had received an MBA from there a few years before) when a letter from the alumni association, soliciting funds, arrived. I simply attached my letter to the bounce back card and sent it back to the association with my statement that they&rsquo;d see hell freeze over before I&rsquo;d ever send them a dime.&#8221;    &mdash;  - anonymous</p>

		<p>&#8220;Our public schools are bearing their share of the burden of making sure our youngsters &ldquo;understand whiteness&rdquo;. All textbooks, for example, are produced with the aid comically elaborate (running to a hundred pages or more) &ldquo;bias and sensitivity&rdquo; guidelines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not just our public schools or youngsters!  </p>
<p>I was required to attend a one-month intensive course for a newly created management position (in a very large governmental organization which shall remain nameless). This course focused on all technical facets of the new position.  However, the subjects of &#8220;Sensitivity&#8221; and &#8220;Diversity&#8221; received BY FAR  the lion&rsquo;s share of the time, and were utter nonsense.  We were required (by some starry-eyed, silly, hippy woman)  to discuss things like &#8220;my first love&#8221; or  &#8220;how I am a sensuous person&#8221;.   I kid you not!  These sensitivity trainers are just make-work jobs for ex-hippies with a mission.  And this nonsense is funded by taxpayers&rsquo; money.</p>

Absolutely!  You may be the only one who noticed that. Even I didn&rsquo;t catch it.  I took a similar course in Puerto Rican Studies because, frankly, it was also a snap course with an easy four credits.  In the same hall were the Black Studies courses. I could hear them in the hallways, and they sounded  more like casual rap sessions than university lectures.  At the end of the semester, grades were posted on the doors, and I noticed that  ALL of them got A&rsquo;s and B&rsquo;s.   There were NO failures.<br>
This is another &#8220;sneaky&#8221; way that grades and diplomas are subsidized. </p>

		<p>Jared Taylor, the Race Realists need to fight back on the grounds of shaming those who shame us. You, better than anyone else, could create our &#8220;talking points.&#8221;  Might sound something like this:</p>
<p><br>
Anyone, especially non whites, who want white people to deconstruct their white identity must first be asked a few questions before they can be qualified to discuss our white privilege.</p>
<p>Do you use any services and products that were invented, built, maintained, and provided by white people whose creative genius was expressed through their cooperative, generous exercise of white privilege? </p>
<p>Please list for us the ways you have benefited personally from the whites who did not put a &#8220;to be used by whites only&#8221; clause on their creations that continue contributing to your own unearned privilege and standard of living today?  </p>
<p>Please tell us those white invented medicines and life saving medical procedures that you will refuse to use and accept? Can you show us your signed legal document in which you declare your boycott of these medicines and procedures, such as a Living Will and Health Care Directive?</p>
<p>When you renounce using any product created, sold, and serviced by white people, then we might listen to you; when you boycott all white people&rsquo;s inventions, we may come to you and ask something of your sainthood, but until then, you are the enemy and we are so warned.  </p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a page with her and her &#8220;credentials&#8221;: http://tinyurl.com/yzff8tc   No doubt the schooling was paid for by those horrible white people, as it should have been according to her thinking,  shaped by her masters. People she doesn&rsquo;t understand or see who pull her strings and formed her thinking.</p>
<p>Maybe we should start classes on the entitlement mentality. Or on groups with superiority complexes even though they haven&rsquo;t accomplished much. Or a course about groups with inferiority complexes because the cultures of those stupid whites have accomplished so much more than their own cultures. Or maybe classes about second rate academics and psuedo-intellectuals who try to provoke and brainwash because they&rsquo;ve been promised some kind of pot at the end of the get rid of whitey rainbow.

		<p>This professor is a bottom feeder among academics.  She has at least 3 part time jobs, this one at UCLA extension, another at Mount St Mary&rsquo;s College, and one at Pacific Oaks.  UCLA Extension is a side business, not a college. MSMC-Doheny campus is a school for not-very-bright Mexican girls, with a really good cafeteria.  Pacific Oaks is a New Age sort of Marxist indoctrination center.  No real college looks for new faculty from any of them.  This woman is totally bush league, just another wannabe hoping to get on the education gravy train.  She&rsquo;ll probably end up teaching  health in a public high school.  </p>

		<p>  Academia really doesn&rsquo;t need special &#8220;whiteness studies&#8221; classes to deconstruct white/Western civilization. In my state school all the social sciences are allied to teach multiculturalism and general hatred of Western culture. These pseudo-Marxist disciplines include sociology, anthropology, English, social work, women&rsquo;s studies, education, history and to a lesser extent psychology. Only the hard sciences, business and math lack a hard left political agenda. Most of the humanities and social science professors are now former sixties radicals as the older more conservative/scholarly professors have mostly retired.</p>

<p>True!  That is EXACTLY how I stumbled upon American Renaissance.

<p>The truth is that blacks are allowed to keep it real. They are insulated from a negative backlash if they speak their minds. Whites can&rsquo;t do this and have been muzzled for 40 or 50 years, with fears of being called &#8220;racist&#8221; if they have a negative thing to say about nonwhites. I don&rsquo;t care anymore. I work with one black guy and one black woman. They are very decent people. Tony, the black guy, always says to come on over. I told him that I should avoid that area.

Whites living in Atlanta are constantly forced to encounter Afroculturalism. We are the minority. Our stories are vital and need retelling. </p>
<p>Today, I saw a group of all whites sitting around tables in a restaurant working on their computers and having a lively work conversation. Their unity of thought and action and cultural affinity was inspiring. My first thought was, &#8220;My God, no Diversity! How wonderful.&#8221; Eventually they all left, leaving me as the only non afro diversity in the restaurant. Skinny white me and several huge, hulking, professional looking afro americans having meetings and looking at their lap top computers. They never hesitate to stare down whitey. I was appropriately intimidated and left while I could. Atlanta is theirs, and you can feel the hostility if you are white and awake. They aren&rsquo;t looking to make white friends. They intimidate  and keep all the unearned race privilege for themselves. Our new Kaseem mayor has the full afro physiognomy  as the rest of the real blacks. He&rsquo;s not mixed like our failure Shirley Franklin. He&rsquo;s the intelligent exception, but as Atlanta fails ever more, smart folks will equate his hostile looking afro face with afro failure. He&rsquo;s hired a bunch of smart white men to be on his team. They will be racists before the end of their first year in office.</p>
<p>Before I left, a tall skinny mulatto model came in. &#8220;Thank God, she grows her &#8216;fro out natural, at about 15 natty inches all around, and she&rsquo;s not straightening it fake and flat as does Michelle Obama and all these professional looking afro american women in Atlanta.&#8221; Being a full high yellow mulatto, she didn&rsquo;t have completely tight kinky wool on her head, but it was kinky enough to show off wild. I secretly praised her authenticity. I want to see afro americans keppn&rsquo; it real. I hate to see afro americans acting white. I&rsquo;d rather gang banging thugs and rap artists than these affirmative action lawyers who dress in suits and ties and shave the kinky wool off their heads. I want real african features, nothing hidden.</p>
<p>I love ebonics. I don&rsquo;t want to hear afro american speak my native tongue like I do. I want them to corrupt it, degrade it, ruin it as a constant reminder to all whitey elites that multiculturalism is white cultural suicide. The more jive and ghetto acting the afros are, the better. Keeps the distinctions between my blood and theirs all the more visible and apparent and prophetic.</p>
<p>This morning another Ga. Tech student was robbed, then after he gave the money, he was stabbed.  5 am at closed midtown Publix. Asians are supposed to have higher IQ&rsquo;s, so you would think they should know how to not get themselves stabbed and robbed in Midtown. Everybody knows that Midtown is a racial war zone after dark. But not really a war, more like a seige. The whites and asians do nothing but get robbed, stabbed, and then report it to police. Nobody would dare do any community organizing.   <br>

<p>Yes, they do want to be distinct up front, and white elites enable and encourage it. We need to applaud it and be hopeful in it. The more visible, outward behaviour differentiation between Afros and  Euros, the better. Then when black failures at assimilation into white civilization are seen daily, the distinctiveness of blackness can attach to criminal proclivities, and our natural instinctive prejudice can grow within us and eventually bear fruit for the white community. Perfection for us would be Michelle Obama in a natural kinky wool &#8216;fro, and Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton in dreads like Lil Jon.</p>
<p>Every time I see that Cornell West on TV, I pray to God that he keeps talking, talking, talking. There is hope for us in repeated exposure to them, especially in times like these when everything is trending toward the predicted chaos. Newly awakened whites are paying attention to what they have been told for forty years did not exist. Thank God for Obamanation and Jeremiah Wright.</p>
<p>And as repulsive as the personalities are on FOXNews, at least they don&rsquo;t shy away from pointing a good portion of the racial aspects of our problems. They interview Michelle Malkin, who shys away from nothing. She ever covered the Knoxville Horror on her blog. Fox must do very good research into the fears of their Republican audience.</p>

		<p>Things such as this make me feel as if some leftist intellectuals told me that Whites don&rsquo;t, or shouldn&rsquo;t, have even the right to exist.</p>
<p>How come no one talks about the many good and great things that White people invented and brought to the world?</p>

		<p>Today in Afro Atlanta I walked into a coffee shop and there was a white girl with a new chocolate black afro baby. Looked like a real full blooded afro american baby and not a high yellow mixed breed obama style baby. Do mulattoes start out darker and become lighter? What I saw looked like a genuine afro with a full white mother. It didn&rsquo;t make sense, so I did an obvious double take, not even hiding my offense, then remembered how many sullen afros hang out in that coffee shop and feared I was being watched and would be targeted as a racist who was stupidly shocked by a whitey white mother with a chocolate black baby. The mother was one of these pinched face, frowning liberal whites who act like they are solving social problems by destroying white privilege and achievement. Couldn&rsquo;t a white baby have given a better return on her white investment in white motherhood?  Is there a trend starting of white women adopting dark afro babies? Will liberal, social justice minded, progressive whites from rich white families deny their free money inheritances from their dead rich white parents while proclaiming the virtue of refusing to profit from unearned white privilege? Are whites who accept their financial inheritances now called &#8220;racists&#8221; who won&rsquo;t acknowledge their unearned white privilege? If they give the unearned inheritance money to the ADL, SPLC, and NAACP, will they be atoned for their sins?</p>

		<p>Ideology is hurting human relationships, as is clear from the posting here. I know the woman who is teaching this class personally. She is one of the bravest, kindest people I know.  I admire her thinking, her compassion and her reflective scholarship. She is also someone who consistently thinks about how to heal the racial divide between Whites and non-Whites. She approaches her work with love and humility; she works with Whites in many schools to understand the pain caused by a legacy of racism and colonialism and does so with a remarkable sensitivity. I am saddened by the viciousness of the postings here. Based on a few sentences, there have been nothing but knee-jerk responses that are fueled by and fueling more hatred. It is painfully ironic that the responses here are full of the kind of hatred that you are accusing, falsely, my friend of. Your responses are not Christian, nor are they indicative of the kind of openness and willingness to learn that are true hallmarks of the positive aspects of Western culture. You shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to claim Western culture as your own. </p>

		<p>64 Christine: Most of us who post here have a personal familiarity with multi- culturalism that is not at all like what it&rsquo;s advocates claim it is.  Our views are not ideological, they are formed from personal experience.  If your friend wants to heal the racial divide between Whites and non-Whites, tell her to stop blaming Whites for everything.   We don&rsquo;t like some foreigner coming here to explain to us how diversity is good for us, or how shameful it is that we like being White Americans and do not wish to adopt the norms of non-White societies.  What your friend calls White supremacy is nothing more than a people wanting to live among their own kind, and keep their own culture.  Should not Filipinos and their culture be supreme in the Phillipines?  Tell your friend to go home if she doesn&rsquo;t like it here.  Maybe she can work at healing the racial divide between Filipinos and their Chinese overlords who despise them so.  </p>

		<p>Christine&rsquo;s remarks seem to be knee-jerk to me. It&rsquo;s always the same story, the non-white is approaching their work with love and compassion, to challenge the cold hate emanating from those evil whites. It&rsquo;s amazing how often we get people who (claim to) &#8220;personally&#8221; know those who hate whites or make their money engaging in hate against whites, but these scam artists themselves will never pay a visit. </p>
<p>If these non-whites are so aggrieved, leave. And if they&rsquo;re still feeling hatred and resentment, as noted above, stop using anything invented or created by whites. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll feel a lot better. </p>

		<p>What American society needs is history classes that describe the whole picure. I mean, courses that will feature in their syllabuses, things like honest descriptions of what Mohawk Ameriacn Indian warriors did to their prisoners; or the fact that late twentieth century African dictators like Idi Amin Dada were actually cannibals, who reportedly ate parts of their ennemies&rsquo; dead bodies&hellip;</p>
<p>Instead of allowing White kids grow up believing that their race has some kind monopoly on evil, we ought to show them the other side of the medal. That would be the honest thing to do, for teachers.</p>

		<p>Question for Christine:</p>
<p>You may know that blacks score lower than whites on accepted IQ tests. Let&rsquo;s presume that the lower black scores the environments caused of systemic racism. Assume that the gap between black IQ&rsquo;s and and white IQ&rsquo;s could be closed if we changed the environment that blacks live in, i.e. turn urban ghettos into multicultural paradises, increase taxes on white property owners to fund the underfunded black schools, enforce more civil rights laws, pass more hate crimes laws, etc.</p>
<p>Would you force whites to make the financial and social sacrifices needed to lift black IQ and achievement? Are whites obligated for black performance? Should white parents care more about opportunities for black children than for their own white children?</p>
<p>If the gap between cats and mice could be closed, who should pay for it? Should cats be obligated to pay for growth hormones that turn mice in super sized mice, or even into great big rats? Would you force expertly trained German Shephard guard into paying for medicines that turn feral house cats into cougars?<br>

<p>That needs to be the standard response to any afro complaining about racism: Stop using anything invented or created by whites!</p>
<p>If they won&rsquo;t stop using our creations, then they are celebrating our diversity and our genius, and their continued complaints prove that they are the truly hateful racists.  </p>
<p>Any whites who don&rsquo;t celebrate Diversity and say &#8220;Diversity is our Strength&#8221; are racists. Any non whites who use white inventions without saying &#8220;Whites Are Our Salvation&#8221; are racists.  <br>

<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t expect honesty, only accountability. Any white teacher who teaches &#8220;critical white studies&#8221; about the evils of the white race, or ever utters &#8220;Diversity is our Strength&#8221;,  should be forced to live as far away from whites as possible. Force them to live in the center of the most non white community within distance.  If they refuse to move there, then force them to explain why, in detail. What do they like about their current neighborhood? Does it have enough diversity? Isn&rsquo;t more diversity better? Why not move to a neighborhood that doesn&rsquo;t have enough white diversity and help bring about truly American multiculturalism? Are you scared of black people?</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t demand that their white daughters date and mate with afrocultural americans and make mulatto babies, then let&rsquo;s call them out as &#8220;racists who haven&rsquo;t yet done the right thing of acknowledging their unearned white privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whites who advocate for non whites should be forced to go all the way. Do Matthews, Dowd, Meacham, Thomas, Foxman, Deas, Potok, Cohen, Beirich, Wise, Lamb, Zinn, Podesta live in non white neighborhoods or answer to non white bosses? If not, why not?  The Amren community must find ways to make them answer those questions.<br>
