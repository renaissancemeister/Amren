<h1><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/military/2009-12-10-military-recruits_N.htm">Fort Hood Ups Challenge to Recruit Muslim, Arab Troops</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kathleen Gray and Donna Leinwand, USA Today, December 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Army recruiter Sgt. Chris McGarity is on the front lines of the military&rsquo;s effort to add troops who speak Arabic and understand Middle Eastern culture  &mdash;  a battle that grew more challenging after the shooting at Fort Hood, Texas.</p>
<p>McGarity says he recently signed up an Arab-American high school student who lacked only her parents&rsquo; approval to enlist. Then came the Nov. 5 rampage at Fort Hood. {snip}</p>
<p>The high school student&rsquo;s mother &#8220;made her withdraw her application,&#8221; McGarity says.</p>
<p>Such experiences illustrate heightened fears of discrimination and harassment aimed at Arab-American and Muslim troops since the Fort Hood shooting, says Mikey Weinstein, a former Air Force lawyer who founded the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, which advocates for separation between church and state in the military.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before the shooting at Fort Hood, the foundation had 80 Muslim clients who had reported instances of discrimination and harassment, Weinstein says. Complaints jumped 20% to 103 in the weeks after the shooting. &#8220;We had people almost immediately .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. being told &#8216;you people&rsquo; should not be in the military,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Weinstein says he regularly gets complaints from troops who report name-calling, extra duty on holidays such as Christmas and Thanksgiving, anti-Muslim graffiti scrawled on prayer centers, and officers who encourage their troops to kill Muslims or demand Christian prayer.</p>
<p><b>Language as a powerful weapon</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year, the Army sought 270 recruits who speak Arabic, Pashto, Dari and Farsi  &mdash;  the languages of Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan  &mdash;  to serve as military interpreters, says Douglas Smith, spokesman for the U.S. Army Recruiting Command at Fort Knox, Ky.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A second recruiting program began in February in New York and has expanded to Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas. That program targets non-citizens who have been in the U.S. at least two years and have special language and cultural skills from the Middle East, China and Korea, he said. The Army has recruited 455 people under that program, which expires Dec. 31.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Making the cut in Dearborn, Mich.</p>
<p>Dearborn, where Arab Americans account for nearly a third of the population, is fertile ground, yet just one Arab-American recruit in 20 makes it through the vetting process, about half the success rate of other recruits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The recruiters recognize that Arab-American enlistees may worry about fitting in with fellow troops or having to fight in Arab or Muslim countries. They work with Arab organizations in the community and attend job fairs to meet potential recruits. They hire Arabic linguists to work in their office, learning about the Middle Eastern cultures themselves.</p>
<p>Sgt. Ian Parker, 27, starts conversations with potential soldiers by asking how they feel about going to Iraq or Afghanistan. &#8220;Once you hit an objection to that, you&rsquo;re just wasting your time,&#8221; Parker says.</p>

		<p>Re the 3rd line in this article:  How can one &#8220;withdraw&#8221; and &#8220;application&#8221; to enter the U.S. Armed Forces?  I am of the understanding that when you sign the name on the bottom line, there is no going back.   And it is one of the few matters of contract law, because of Federal law, where minors aren&rsquo;t able to weasel out because of their age.</p>

They grovel, and our enemies kick them like dogs for their trouble, and they promise to double their groveling.

<p>Only moronic white elites would suffer murders of their people by fanatical haters of Christians and wring their hands with worry about the repercussion it might have on people who hate them and want their own fanatically driven religion to prevail. </p>
<p>The several posters who are always reminding us that whites don&rsquo;t deserve to be in charge, because they have too many fools in their population are right.</p>

		<p>Poster #1 question is good but to answer it more info is needed.  If the applicant is 17 years old parent&rsquo;s permission is required.  No matter how much paper work is signed, if the appicant is 17, the parent&rsquo;s permission is required.  I would imagine this is the case that poster #1 is concerned about.  18 years or older it&rsquo;s a different matter.  This should cover all branches of the military.  &#8220;We Serve&#8221; 23d Inf Regiment, US Army</p>

		<p>There is a strategy behind minority immigrants entering our military, especially the non-citizens. Our government knows these new recruits will have their loyalties to their home countries, and their own people. </p>
<p>This will make it much easier for our enemy government to declare Martial Law with the knowledge that these new minority recruits will have no problem rounding us up for the FEMA camps; with even less problem putting a bullet into us, since they loathe us anyway.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theory ? Not hardly. It is a conspiracy by our government to act against it&rsquo;s citizens, but it is reality, not theory. ~Rande</p>

		<p>Oh, of course it&rsquo;s still our fault. <br>
There are a number of American ex Muslims who say that the only safe course of action was to ban all immigration from Muslim countries after Sept. 11. <br>
One day, perhaps soon, there will be a Mega Attack that will make Sept. 11 look like a picnic. Millions might die. School buses shot up. Radioactive dust from bombs making Manhattan uninhabitable for a thousand years. Anthrax from a stolen crop duster kills millions over downtown L.A. A nuke missle fired from a couple of rusty old frieghters in the Gulf of Mexico explode over the US 250 miles high and the Electro Magnetic Pulse destroys all of our technology in a second. No cell phones. No cars. No tractors. No computers. 90% of the population could starve to death within a year. <br>
Liberalism is a mental disease, like Alzheimers. Also, like that disease, it is fatal to the country that develops it. </p>

<p>For the record, we are not the problem. Muslims in the army shooting and killing our men and women are the problem.</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to allow those whose religion compels them to &#8220;kill the infidel&#8221; to join the US Armed Forces.  Even putting religion aside, we should allow to serve in the US Armed Forces only those men and women for whom primary loyalty is to the US and to the Constitution they are sworn to defend.</p>

		<p>One of the reasons for Rome&rsquo;s collapse was when the average Roman male decided that military service was just too inconvient and burdensome thus compelling their government to enlist foreigners to fill the legion ranks. Loyalty to the country then died on the vine. The once invincible Roman army then regularly got their backsides whipped in battle due to a fragile, if any, troop loyalty to the country. </p>
<p>Then there is today&rsquo;s young American male that joins the military only if it personally pays off in the long run for him.  As well, he will be facing an enemy and culture that has raised their children to be angry, hostile, aggressive, and weapons proficient at a very early age. In Muslim schools the students shout their mantra of, &#8220;kill the Americans&#8221; almost on a daily basis. Now compare the Muslim kids with American kids. American children must hug trees and bunnies, they must never pick up a gun because that&rsquo;s brutal and of no practical use, and they must always be made happy and fulfilled. If one of them gets hurt on the football or baseball field, mommy and/or daddy sues the school. Oh!  The trauma of it all! </p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s our government &#8220;support&#8221; of our troops:</p>

		<p>proactive is full of nonsense, above. It is White male recruits who suffer combat casualties in excess of their percentage of the population.  They are pulling their duty.  My only question is why?  I&rsquo;d like to see Whites pull out entirely from the military and leave the blacks, browns, and asians to die in these remote slag heaps.  I&rsquo;d prefer to keep our people at home, whole, armed, and prepared to defend themselves in their own houses, towns, and states.</p>

<p>That is NOT the problem here. White Americans are perfectly willing to volunteer. In fact, I&rsquo;d say they are TOO willing to go off on our government&rsquo;s adventurism in Iraq and Afghanistan, places where we have absolutely no business being.</p>

		<p>Do you ever notice that one never sees any stories of positive outcomes that result from multiculturalism and diversity? The truth is that diversity only benefits the wealthiest of people who are far removed and quite safe from the cultural calamity that exists below them.</p>
<p>I routinely notice that when Black criminals charge into a convenience store and assault and murder everyone inside, the story is soon followed by a renewed push to promote and praise the &#8220;virtues of diversity&#8221;. </p>
<p>The issue is that the media does not provide us with any examples of how diversity supposedly benefits us. Why are we consistently told that &#8220;racial tolerance is needed,&#8221; if diversity is supposedly such a wonderful state of existence? That is akin to saying, &#8220;Extending one&rsquo;s hand into an open flame is good! One simply must learn to tolerate the pain!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense!</p>
<p>Even the super-Liberal Harvard professor, Dr. Robert Putnam, was embarrassed to learn during his research that diversity is quite harmful to society. It causes individuals to overwhelmingly close down and largely withdraw from any social interaction whatsoever, even among members of the same race!</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, that is what our political &#8220;leaders&#8221; and their puppet masters want; distrust and a complete breakdown in bonding, fellowship, interaction, and communication among Whites, especially White males. What better way to neutralize any threat of resistance to their plans?</p>
<p>So, the next time you notice that one or more Blacks have punched out a blind White woman, murdered a helpless White grandmother, gang-raped and murdered a young White couple, and committed an array of violent attacks and homicides against Whites, scan the news to see additional articles that espouse the imaginary &ldquo;virtues of diversity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As we have all witnessed, many egalitarian, super-Liberal Whites would rather die than be perceived as racists! It is a disturbing truth that we must come to terms with, my friends!<br>

		<p>Western civilization is pretty much &#8220;stuck on stupid&#8221; and nothing&rsquo;s going to get better until we change what we are doing. When I joined the military back in 1981, we actually had to undergo a background check and swear allegiance. What is the military doing recruting Arab speaking Muslims into its ranks for anyways? Those competencies can and should be obtained externally through consulting contracts. What happens when an Arab speaking Muslim enlisted man of rank or even officer takes a whole platoon or company on a rampage???</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think that there is anything inherently wrong about recruiting Arabs or Muslims (by the way, most Arabs in the United States are Christian, not Muslim).  Indian Scouts, for example, were recruited by the American military during the 1800s even when the United States was at war with the Indians.  That being said, I think it&rsquo;s ridiculous that the military and political leadership thinks Nidal Malik Hassan was just some random mass murderer.</p>

		<p>17 Odoacer: True, the U.S. Army had Indian scouts, but they were from tribes that were enemies of whoever we were fighting.  For example, Pawnee and Crow scouts served with us against the Sioux.  As far as the scouts were concerned, they had recruited the White soldiers to help them fight their own wars.  Any use of Middle Easterners in our military ought keep that in mind, and use them only against their own ancestral enemies.<br>

		<p>Notice how this article begins with a &#8220;sob story&#8221;. An honorable, patriotic, completely integrated Muslim (what we&rsquo;re supposed to believe) wants to join the military. However, &#8220;fears of discrimination and harassment&#8221; (presumably from everyone&rsquo;s favorite racist bad guy, whitey) deterred our hero. Besides, what kind of fool would be weary of Muslims when that religion just compelled someone to kill 13 of your fellow soldiers, right? That&rsquo;s just silly talk, &#8220;discrimination&#8221;!</p>
<p>Guys, a good rule of thumb is to immediately put yourself on guard when an article begins with a sob story. It means someone is trying to manipulate your emotions in order to essentially propagandize you. The liberal media, and our schools, have absolutely perfected this art of deception. This sort of thing even rules the speech codes for the reporters&rsquo; associations.</p>

&#8220;Even the super-Liberal Harvard professor, Dr. Robert Putnam, was embarrassed to learn during his research that diversity is quite harmful to society. It causes individuals to overwhelmingly close down and largely withdraw from any social interaction whatsoever, even among members of the same race!&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed it does, plus many other negative factors could be listed, but it would take a book to cover them all.</p>
<p>That this Putnam was surprised to learn how harmful diversity is to society is an excellent example that reveals most academics are no more than out-of-touch airheads who know absolutely nothing of value about the real world.  Rather than regarded as studious types who have the answers to many things, there&rsquo;s a growing opinion among the public that most of these people are no more than fools who can be so easily duped their opinions are next to worthless.  Just look at the fools who offer opinions on global warming that people not even in the field can see are just plain nonsense.</p>
<p>Academics long ago went the way of radical leftist, agenda driven dupes whose beliefs are gullible, naive, but, worst of all, they&rsquo;re just plain wrong.  Now, we have been learning via Dr. Watson; the Climategate scandal; Dr. Flynn&rsquo;s distorted stats, that the scientific community is influenced by the same far left agenda to the point that they skew their information to fit their ideology.</p>
<p>The more I learn; the longer I think about it, the best environment to try to establish are what some are doing now, which is to gather together in remote, like-minded communities, in order to cull the white, gullible fools who are detrimental to the basic principles of the constitution and the traditional way of life of many white Americans.</p>
<p>With smaller communities the ability to purge these types would be much easier, and it would be necessary to do so to keep the overall society from deteriorating to a collective hare-brained status, as it is now.</p>
<p>Separating from non-whites is vitally important, but culling out white fools is even more crucial to obtaining a successful society.</p>

<p>There are plenty of people who can speak Arabic who are not muslims - Lebanese Christians, Egyptian Coptics etc. We have no need for Muslims in the Forces - we didn&rsquo;t need Nazi&rsquo;s to defeat Hitler.</p>
<p>One troubling turn of events is the potential for using American forces against Americans - having non-Americans in the Army helps in that..</p>
<p>Recently it was reported that British troops have been asked whether they are &#8220;prepared to fire upon their own people&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is worrying. The British Government knows that Civil unrest is likely as the drive for mass non-white immigration rushes ahead, the cult of Multiculturalism and the rise of Islamic hegemony. The British people are sick to their stomachs of what has been done to their country.</p>
<p>The Government is actively considering using British Troops to shoot British people if they dare to fight back.</p>
<p>They may just find the guns trained on them&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

		<p>Definition of insanity:  Doing the same thing over and over, and expecting different results.  By that light, our military has gone insane.</p>

<p>Any military non-whites and non-citizens who attempt to fire on white Americans would be shot by white mutineers in the military.  Not all of our white soldiers are soulless robots who would shoot their own mothers if ordered to do so.  Besides, the mutineers would have tens of millions of well-armed civilian allies whereas the non-whites, non-citizens and white soulless robots would have none&hellip;</p>
