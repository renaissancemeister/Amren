<h1>Investigation: Illegal Workers on Elmendorf AFB</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrea Gusty, KTVA-TV (Anchorage), December 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A contractor hired for a major construction project on Elmendorf Air Force Base broke both state and federal law.</p>
<p>At issue: the illegal immigrants that were granted access to the base to help construct the Air Force&rsquo;s new F-22 hangars.</p>
<p>This summer the Air Force started a multi-million dollar effort to build new F-22 hangars on Elmendorf Air Force Base. The contractor hired for the steel work was Steel System Erectors out of California.</p>
<p>An investigation has reviled the company employed undocumented workers and allowed them access to a national security site.</p>
<p>A &#8220;critical infrastructure site essential to national security.&#8221; That is how the federal government describes Elmendorf Air Force Base.</p>
<p>At each entrance, security checks the ids and has the right to search the vehicles of all who enter the base. So then, how were illegal immigrants with forged and expired documents granted access?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lewis [Ironworkers Local 751 President/Organizer John Lewis] noticed this summer that Steel System Erectors out of southern California had not hired any local workers. In fact, he found the company flew 30 employees from California to Alaska for the job.</p>
<p>&#8220;For you to be able to bid a job and win it with the cost of air fare and housing for that many men raises a huge red flag that something- there&rsquo;s another area where you are cheating,&#8221; says Lewis, &#8220;Either your cutting costs on workers comp, or you are misclassifying your workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lewis would find Steel System Erectors was doing both. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s extremely disturbing that a contractor is able to, day after day for months on end, take undocumented workers and get them through security,&#8221; says Lewis.</p>
<p>While they declined to talk on camera, officials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did confirm four of Steel System Erectors&rsquo; employees on the Elmendorf job did not have proper employment documents, and one of those even had a criminal history in California.</p>
<p>Since the federal investigation at the end of October, all four men have been arrested. One of the workers has been deported, two voluntarily returned to their country, and one will be pleading his case in front of an immigration judge.</p>

		<p>Looked up Elmendorf   &mdash;   Anchorage, Alaska.  Will there be any consternation from the state&rsquo;s former Governor?</p>
<p>The irony of this article is that there are probably a few illegal aliens serving in the USAF and stationed there.</p>

		<p>Indeed, contractors have been a huge source of the problems involving illegal immigration. They have actively transported people illegally into this nation from Mexico, they work them but never have disability insurance for them, so when they get hurt they send them to taxpayer paid hospitals and emergency room, and their building prices have never gone down two cents, while committing all of this illegality. Where is the party of &#8220;workers rights&#8221; on all of this? </p>

		<p>So the F-22s will be stationed in the Frozen North to fight those fiendish Russians?</p>
<p>Sounds like a fine example of military inertia!</p>
<p>Has anyone told the USAF boneheads that the Cold War is over and that future enemies are unlikely to be Russkis?</p>

		<p>The new Federal Courthouse was built in Miami a couple of years ago, all the carpenters in the federal worksite were Guatamalans brought in by a Texas contractor, Some of the local union guys bitched about it for months and no one did anything, finally someone in the IBEW got someone to take notice and the carpenters were let go and locals hired, this stuff happens daily across America. No one goes to jail, it is against the law to hire foreign workers on federal work site.<br>
 A huge hotel on the beach had all sheetmetal workers hired as visa workers, the company placed an ad in the paper 6 days after filing, they have ten days to lok for locals before they can hire visa workers, by the time tho local union knew they were hiring and sent guys to the site it was the tenth day and they were refused. Millions out of work and we hire foreign nationals to save a buck, the local senator did her we are looking into it song and dance but the work got done by cheap foreign labor in the midst of construction workers losing their homes.</p>
<p>watch this youtube video, it is amazing as it is the first news story I have ever seen sympathetic to American workers losing k jobs to visa workers.</p>
