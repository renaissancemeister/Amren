<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Target is sponsoring Univision&rsquo;s annual holiday music special, &#8220;Target presenta Nuestra Navidad&#8221; (&#8220;Target presents Our Christmas&#8221;), which will rebroadcast Christmas morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Target presenta Nuestra Navidad&rsquo; is a great partnership and has become an important holiday tradition to Target,&#8221; says Greg Cunningham, group manager of marketing at Target. &#8220;The program allows us to highlight some of our greatest charitable programs like Target Volunteers School Library Makeovers and Target House, which is an amazing way to kick off this holiday season.&#8221;</p>
<p>Along with celebrations of culture and music, this year&rsquo;s show will focus of the power of volunteerism. Joining in the spirit of community outreach, Target, one of DiversityInc&rsquo;s 25 Noteworthy Companies, partnered with the Heart of America Foundation and local team members to renovate a school library for P.S. 155 in East Harlem, N.Y., where they donated thousands of books and created an inspiring space for kids to learn, thrive and grow. The children, the school librarian and their principal, Lillian Ortiz, were also treated to a musical performance by David Archuleta of &#8220;American Idol&#8221; and Latin entertainer PeeWee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Volunteerism is the heart of the Target culture and this year&rsquo;s show is especially near and dear to us,&#8221; says Laysha Ward, president of community relations at Target. &#8220;As part of this year&rsquo;s special, Target is proud to continue our involvement with a local New York school that received a Target Volunteers School Library Makeover and bring the students a once-in-a-lifetime special performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The show also features a special tour of Target House, a free home-away-from-home for families receiving long-term treatment at St. Jude Children&rsquo;s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. Puerto Rican singer/songwriter Luis Fonsi pays a holiday visit to children and their families at Target House.</p>
<p>The Christmas special also highlights hometown heroes from Latino communities nationwide  &mdash;  including a troubled 20-year-old in Los Angeles who turns his life around with the help of a professor and musician, and a 90-year-old grandmother in Bronx, N.Y., who is an advocate for the elderly community in her neighborhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;This holiday season, we are excited to share this uplifting holiday special with our viewers and celebrate inspiring individuals who selflessly give back to our community,&#8221; says Alina Falc√≥n, executive vice president and operating manager, Univision Network. &#8220;We are honored to once again work with Emilio Estefan and Target to bring families across the country a touch of joy this holiday season.&#8221;<br>

		<p>As long as we are examining the subject of craven corporate insults to American religious heritage, I thought that it might be apropos to point out Coca-Cola&rsquo;s diversity winter season promotional labeling campaign and to also point out that in the the Hispanic world there doesn&rsquo;t exist (as of yet) this all encompassing generic &#8220;holiday celebration&#8221; politically correct speech or ad copy. </p>
<p>On &#8220;Holiday Season&#8221; two liter Coke bottles pay close attention to the text over Santa&rsquo;s head on both sides of the bottle. One side bears &#8220;Feliz Navidad&rsquo; which is a functionally straight up translation of &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221;. No ambiguity there as to religious roots. The English side is some Kwanzanesque HAPPY SOMETHING OR ANOTHER jive that has nothing to do with any body&rsquo;s religion. </p>
<p>In terms of terminology and an aversion pusillanimous PC wording I&rsquo;m going to have to admit that Latin Americans do have greater &#8220;Family Values&#8221; notwithstanding other items previously discussed.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised that diversityinc is a huge fan of Target stores. Their television and print ads are always filled loads of non-white faces, they will always have your token black, often in addition to scores of asians and mestizos. It apparently doesn&rsquo;t matter to Target that the average white has more spending power than the typical black or mestizo, and that we&rsquo;re a larger share of the population. They&rsquo;re just another one of those big corporations wanting to show off how trendy they are when it comes to highlighting the wonders of &#8216;diversity.&rsquo; Although shouldn&rsquo;t those doyens of sensitivity over at diversityinc point out to them that &#8216;navidad&rsquo; is Spanish for  Christmas and that they risk offending some random Hispanic who might not be Christian with such an ungainly greeting?!</p>

		<p>I stopped shopping at Target a while back due to their sparse depictions of whites on the posters inside their stores.  I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that most of the whites shown were females and typically with the obligatory black male right beside them.</p>

		<p>Living in SoCA as I do, I&rsquo;ve gotten used to hearing, and speaking Spanish when needed.  I&rsquo;m not offended by a &#8220;Feliz Navidad&#8221; or &#8220;Prospero Ano Nuevo&#8221; - but I think they should be accompanied by the same thing in English.  I learned Spanish bkz I wanted to be able to communicate with my students; I was not forced to learn it.  I was not happy that it seemed necessary - I really believe we should vote in English as our official language and everything else as secondary.  So, from my point of view, Spanish isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, but English should be primary.</p>

		<p>  Target has come under pressure recently from La Rasa for actually checking potential employees to make sure they&rsquo;re citizens. This is an attempt by Target to placate the Hispanic lobbies  &mdash;  I don&rsquo;t think it will succeed.</p>

		<p>Corporate cynicism truly seems to know no bounds. This reminds me of the other day when I was going over a Leading Computer Manufacturer&rsquo;s web interface for its suppliers. The Computer Manufacturer has a form which asks about the &#8220;diversity&#8221; of the staff of companies which sell it goods or services.</p>
<p>Then at the bottom of the page it said that only US-based suppliers are required to fill in the questionnaire.  If the Computer Manufacturer really cared about &#8220;diversity&#8221;, why wouldn&rsquo;t it hold foreign companies to the same standard? My answer: they don&rsquo;t really care about &#8220;diversity&#8221; at all; they care about covering their behinds against discrimination lawsuits  and nothing more.</p>

<p>I agree and would also add that in the countries I spend time in all of the school kids are learning other languages but few American school kids speak anything or only speak Spanish. THis is a failing which has forced the U.S. military to depend on traiterous Muslims as interpreters. This is a problem with all the countries in which the military is involved, being forced to use locals as translators/interpreters. I speak fairly good Arabic, but don&rsquo;t read it well yet and have heard things which I have told the military of and sent at least one interpreter to prison. White American school children should learn foreign languages.</p>

		<p>SKIP - (post #7) - I absolutely agree with you.  We should be training the folks in our military who are good at language to learn Arabic and other languages so that we can rely on OUR OWN to do our translating for us, with a relative certainty that they won&rsquo;t turn on us as the traitorous Muslims can and do.  We also should be teaching our children foreign languages; we are the only leading nation in the world that doesn&rsquo;t.  Scandinavian kids speak English like natives in grade school; British kids speak French like natives in grade school; Swiss kids learn French, German, and Italian, because those are the 3 languages spoken in their country.  If they all can do it, we can.  And it would definitely improve our kids&rsquo; educational levels if we did!!</p>
