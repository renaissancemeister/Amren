			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Sessions, Politics Daily, December 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama has rebutted recent criticism from actor Danny Glover and some members of Congress that he has not done enough to help the African-American community since taking office, Politico reports. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Glover, known for his activism along with his acting, said recently that &#8220;the Obama administration has followed the same playbook, to a large extent, almost verbatim, as the Bush administration. I don&rsquo;t see anything different.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What&rsquo;s so clear is that this country from the outset is projecting the interests of wealth and property.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the interview Monday [with Talking to American Urban Radio Networks reporter April Ryan], the president acknowledged the difficulties: &#8220;We were some of the folks who were most affected by predatory lending,&#8221; he said, using the plural pronoun to refer to black Americans. &#8220;There&rsquo;s a long history of us being the last hired and the first fired. As I said on health care, we&rsquo;re the ones who are in the worst position to absorb companies deciding to drop their health care plans. So, should people be satisfied? Absolutely not. But let&rsquo;s take a look at what I&rsquo;ve done.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Does this mean Danny Glover is now going to pay tribute to people like Jared Taylor and Alex Jones, who was telling us that, save race and party, Obama=Bush, all along?</p>

		<p>It will never be possible to satisfy black ingrates.  As long as they inhabit a society, that society will be rife with crime, inefficiency, incompetence and on the edge of chaos throughout its existence.</p>
<p>Glover has about as much charisma, as an actor, as a tree.  Why anyone would pay to see a movie with him in it is an absolute mystery to me.</p>

<p>Where foreign policy is concerned, he&rsquo;s absolutely right.  Alot of people expected him to keep his promise on removing US troops from the Middle East and what did they get?  More lies.  Here we are in economic decline and we&rsquo;re wasting lives and billions of dollars to fight some murky &#8220;war on terror&#8221; with no clear objectives while some world leader goes around saying they&rsquo;ll squeeze us for everything we&rsquo;ve got until we dry up and blow away.  </p>

		<p>How many po blacks does Mr. Glover contribute MONEY to, or does he think just being an &#8220;activist&#8221; is enough? If just being an activist were enough it would be ok, BUT they always want our money thrown at them.</p>

What Mr. Glover means is that President Obama isn&rsquo;t pandering to blacks the way blacks expected a black president to.</p>

<p>I was saying this a long time ago.  I knew that no matter who got elected, it would be, &#8220;meet the new boss, same as the old boss.&#8221;</p>
<p>Voter&rsquo;s remorse there?</p>

		<p>Glover is like other blacks-they accuse whites of being racists and bigots for wanting what we want for ourselves.  Plus, I&rsquo;m tired of hearing black celebrities like him complain about racism and how they can&rsquo;t get a taxi cab.  I&rsquo;m sick of black celebrity whining!</p>

		<p>During the campaign, Obama was unable to provide an exit strategy for Iraq, and was not forthcoming about his plans for Afghanistan. It should come as no surprise, then, that he has not lessened our involvement in Iraq, and has deepened our involvement in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Glover lives in a bubble, so his grip on reality has never been that good.</p>

<p>I think Mister Glover should keep in mind that the Hollywood system that creates stars, is run by Whites, and it has actually made him a rich man just for his role as Murtaugh, Mel Gibson&rsquo;s sidekick in the Lethal Weapon tetralogy.</p>

<p>Well-said paisan! Glover has made millions in Hollywood, so he should STFU and count his money, or think of what he&rsquo;s going to buy next, if he&rsquo;s that bored.</p>
<p>Is he aware that most of the money he earns comes from whitey, as well as the programs that help his &#8220;disadvantaged bruthas and sistas&#8221;. come from whitey&rsquo;s taxes?</p>
