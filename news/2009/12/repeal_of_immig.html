			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jean Ortiz, Lincoln Journal Star (Nebraska), December 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nebraska lawmakers are set to again consider repealing a law that offers tuition breaks to some illegal immigrants, and the looming debate is already drawing support.</p>
<p>A majority of lawmakers participating in an Associated Press pre-session survey say they support rescinding the offer made after lawmakers fought to override Gov. Dave Heineman&rsquo;s veto to pass the law in 2006.</p>
<p>Of the 33 senators responding to the survey, 18 said they support repealing the measure, while six said they don&rsquo;t. Eight said they&rsquo;re unsure. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 2006 law benefits students whose parents brought them to the United States illegally. It allows Nebraska high school graduates who aren&rsquo;t U.S. citizens or legal residents to attend a Nebraska public college or university at the in-state tuition rate. They must have lived in the state for at least three years and must be pursuing or promise to pursue legal status.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As of mid-December, 35 such students were enrolled in the state university system, according to figures compiled by Janssen&rsquo;s [Sen. Charlie Janssen of Fremont] office. That includes 17 at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and 15 at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. State colleges reported none, and community college officials didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to a request for the information.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Supporters of Nebraska&rsquo;s law say it gives an incentive to students to remain in high school, get an education and eventually contribute to society and the economy of the state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Opponents say it&rsquo;s unfair to offer a discount to those breaking the law. They also say it sends the wrong message about Nebraska&rsquo;s stance on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nine other states  &mdash;  California, Illinois, Kansas, New Mexico, New York, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin  &mdash;  have such in-state tuition laws for students who are in the country illegally. Oklahoma repealed its law in 2008.<br>

		<p>So the Governor is for in-state tuition for illegals?  Not a surprise, b/c Hispanics are a fast growing minority in the state, and the agricultural processing plants that love to enslave/hire them have a lot of dirty money to dump on politicians.</p>
<p>Why do illegal aliens get in-state tuition before American citizens who reside in a different state?  There&rsquo;s no fairness in that.  Illegal alien from Mexico is worth more than native born white American in Iowa.</p>

		<p>What a ridiculous thing to be debating.</p>
<p>What they should be debating instead is a law that would make it a felony for a school employee to not check the status of prospective students and report illegals to the authorities.</p>

		<p>I simply do not understand laws that give in-state tuition to people who are in the country illegally.   If some kind from Council Bluffs, IA, which is essentially a suburb of Omaha, NE wants to go to the University of Nebraska, he must pay out of state tuition.  But of some person sneaks into the country and stays illegally, they get to pay a cheaper rate.   Note only is that patently stupid on the surface, it&rsquo;s a classic example of  bad law introducing a moral hazard.  Should actual Iowa citizens try to game the system by claiming they&rsquo;re illegal aliens?  If so, then how does one prove one is an illegal alien in order to get the better tuition rates?</p>
<p>Without a doubt, there is no good law that comes from racial pandering, none.  </p>

		<p>What a bunch of dilettantes. If you want to nip this theft in the bud - repeal Plyler vs Doe.</p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/sutherland/taxpayer_expense.htm</p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/sutherland/the_solution.htm</p>
<p>https://blog.vdare.com/archives/2009/02/01/illegal-rights-and-the-supreme-court/</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;In support of my friend anonymous, I concur with his argument against the Court ruling on Plyler v. Doe. It was a 5 v. 4 decision with the minority opinion given by Chief Justice Burger, who stated:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Equal Protection Clause does not mandate identical treatment of different categories of persons. The Equal Protection Clause guarantees similar treatment of similarly situated persons, but it does not mandate a constitutional hierarchy of governmental services. Without laboring what will seem obvious to many, it simply is not &ldquo;irrational&rdquo; for a state to conclude that it does not have the same responsibility to provide benefits to persons whose very presence in the state and this country is illegal as it does to provide for persons lawfully present. By definition, illegal aliens have no right whatever to be here, and the state may reasonably, and constitutionally, elect not to provide them with governmental services at the expense of those who are lawfully in the state.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chief Justice Burger emphasized in his dissent:</p>
<p>The Court makes no attempt to disguise that it is acting to make up for Congress&rsquo; lack of &ldquo;effective leadership&rdquo; in dealing with the serious national problems caused by the influx of uncountable millions of illegal aliens across our borders. &hellip; However, it is not the function of the Judiciary to provide &ldquo;effective leadership simply because the political branches of government fail to do so. &hellip; The Court employs, and in my view, abuses the Fourteenth Amendment in an effort to become an omnipotent and omniscient problem solver. That the motives for doing so are noble and compassionate does not alter the fact that the Court distorts our constitutional function to make amends for the defaults of others. [xvii] &hellip; If ever a court was guilty of an unabashedly result-oriented approach, this case is a prime example. [xviii]</p>
<p>Plyler v. Doe can never stand as settled law, as it has no sound basis in the 14 Amendment that it purports to have as a foundation.</p>
<p>The last sentence of the Chief Justice&rsquo;s dissent sums up: </p>
<p>&ldquo;The solution to this seemingly intractable problem is to defer to the political processes, unpalatable as that may be to some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of ruling on the Constitutionality of Plyler v. Doe, the Court usurped political power that is the prerogative of Congress and the president and wrote its own legislation and couched it in the guise of a judical ruling. Moreover, the minority opinion passes the smell test, while the majority&rsquo;s does not. </p>

		<p>It was my understanding that in the last governor&rsquo;s race, Heineman won over Osborne because he was against illegals getting free tuition.  Just shows that you can&rsquo;t trust any politician, republican or democrat.</p>

		<p>Some states already have, how shall we say, lax guidelines for establishing residence.I knew a Costa Rican who listed a PO Box within the state when applying to a state school. It didn&rsquo;t matter to admissions that his transcript was from a Costa Rican high school, or that he had no fixed address, only a PO box. I, like a fool, had been paying out-of-state tuition. I didn&rsquo;t understand how easy it was to scam the system.</p>
<p>By the way, if the Chief Justice were alive today, the wise Latina would find him guilty of a hate crime.</p>
