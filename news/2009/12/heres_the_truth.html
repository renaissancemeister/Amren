<h1>Here&rsquo;s the Truth Behind the Tiger Woods Scandal</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Whitlock, Fox Sports, December 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Armed with the supposition that this brown-skinned golfer has irreversibly harmed an attractive, blonde-haired, blue-eyed white woman, much of the sports media have turned Elin Nordegren into Natalee Holloway and reached for ratings and relevancy by traveling the route paved by Nancy Grace.</p>
<p>There is, believe it or not, another direction to explore. There is another reality we can reluctantly accept. If we choose, we, the media, can do our job and put Tiger&rsquo;s transgressions in their proper context and explain to the public what happened to the perceived traditional ideals of the sports world.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re outraged and stunned that Tiger has had a dozen alleged affairs. The typical rock or movie star is laughing and/or questioning Tiger&rsquo;s sexuality if the golfer limited himself to a number below 50 since marriage and 500 in his post-puberty lifetime.</p>
<p>The notion that golf, with its history of unapologetic racism and sexism, is somehow filled with men of impeccable integrity is a hysterical lie propagandized by hypocritical white men willing to commit the same crime they charge Tiger and his sponsors pulled off: the upholding of a patently false image.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As far as I know, Tiger grew up on golf courses in suburban Orange County, raised by an African-American, Chinese and Native American father and Thai, Chinese and Dutch mother. That is not the recipe for falling in love with sistas regardless of Tiger&rsquo;s brown skin and full lips.</p>
<p>By profession and diction, the dude would be considered a nerd by most brothers and sisters. Take away his billion dollars and many of the sisters whining that Tiger prefers blondes would continue their search for a tatted-up, corn-rowed, slang-talking real brother.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tiger&rsquo;s choice in women isn&rsquo;t a statement about how he feels about us (black folks). It&rsquo;s a statement about where and how he grew up.</p>
<p>The reaction to Tiger&rsquo;s preference exposes America&rsquo;s deep-seated racial hang-ups. Black and white people are equally troubled by Tiger&rsquo;s parade of Caucasian conquests. This unrest is fueling much of the media manipulation of and wallowing in this story.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Elin was black, this would be a Left Eye-Andre Rison situation and everyone would move on,&#8221; John Salley cracked.</p>
<p>When I talked with sociologist Dr. Harry Edwards, he addressed the racial dynamic more seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Elin were black, this would be on the scale of Mike Tyson and Robin Givens,&#8221; Dr. Edwards explained. &#8220;It would&rsquo;ve lasted a while and then it would just go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>That may sound preposterous to some, but it&rsquo;s not. The media and the public overreact to whatever crimes/unfairness befall an attractive white woman (Natalee Holloway). Jordan, Ali and Magic all managed to play on their black wives without receiving much criticism. Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal just finished off the remaining credible pieces of his marriage to a black woman by allegedly having an ongoing affair with Gilbert Arenas&rsquo; fiancee. No one cares. But this brown-skinned golfer is facing ruin because he cheated on his white wife.</p>
<p> &#8220;You&rsquo;re getting reverberations of O.J.,&#8221; Dr. Edwards said. &#8220;White America, corporate America feels betrayed. Tiger was accepted and given all the perks and benefits and now they feel betrayed, the same betrayal they felt with O.J. There are some (black) celebrities that get to dip their biscuit in the gravy of corporate America and then there are some that are given their own bowl of gravy. Tiger had rare access. His sponsors choreographed a superhuman image to promote a sport and sell product. They gave him everything except the latitude to exercise his humanity. There are no super humans down here. There&rsquo;s only us, and sometimes we blow it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Are you kidding me?!  The reason this is such a big deal is Tiger had a completely clean image and it turns out his banging anything with a pulse.  No one really thought Mike Tyson was a stand-up guy.  Get back to reality.</p>

<p>This writer has an uncanny ability to 1 sentence out of about 50 make actually sense, yet he&rsquo;s probably an important figure in the world of sport writing. If he were a white guy, and wrote a story where 49 sentences made perfect sense, and 1 sentence was objectionable, he&rsquo;d probably be fired for the 1 sentence that bothered. </p>

		<p>Whitlock makes sense much of the time. But this isnt one of those times. Woods isnt choosing beautiful white women to &#8220;dally&#8221; with because of where he grew up. He is choosing them because they are beautiful white women. They are the most beautiful women on the planet. Plus you dont get all that drama and &#8220;loudness&#8221; that comes with other women. Im sure Woods is well aware of this. Not that I endorse miscegenation or interracial dating.</p>

		<p>No scandal like this has ever occurred in golf so it&rsquo;s no wonder that Tiger Woods is receiving the heat he has. With his selfish, self-serving behavior he proves that all it takes it one successful black to tarnish an entire community. Shame on him and his base, egotistic and corrupt behavior for lowering the morale, decency and image of a once clean sport.  But then again, did anyone expect anything different?  And I ask the writer of this racist piece, if Tiger Woods had been white, cheating on his black wife in this manner, the &#8220;black community&#8221; would have been up in arms calling for a lynching and ruination of his career.  Again, the black community shows its blatant racism and double standard when it serves their own interests.  </p>

		<p>The sport of golf is sexist and racist? And he&rsquo;s very angry about it&hellip; If this article isn&rsquo;t a defense of wife beating, or at least beating your white wife, then it is certainly a considered defense of adultery. I guess they do have an authentic voice there at FOX Sports representing the black male.</p>

<p>Funny how a Swedish woman adopted our marriage value of strict monogamy but an American-born African didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yes, adherence to our American marriage value of strict monogamy is the problem. If we simply redefine marriage to mean anything (such as including same sex couples) then there is no issue with Mr. Woods.</p>
<p>A few years backs, wasn&rsquo;t there someone proposing that black men weren&rsquo;t promiscuous and that they were only practicing serial monogamy?<br>

		<p>Jason Whitlock has a point.  This affair is a &#8216;safe&rsquo; way for people to impolitely ogle an interracial marriage. Before the scandal they would pretend they were unfazed by seeing an attractive blonde with a black man (that would be racist!). </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a VERY LOUD statement about what he thinks of the attractiveness of black women, just as other black males do.  If they can get a woman of any race other than black they&rsquo;ll do so.  Unfortunately, most of them have to settle for black women.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not bright enough to try to spin a happy face on this whole fiasco, brutha, even though we knew you were going to try.</p>
<p>Next, you will try to repair his image, right along with the big money types who make money off his image.  </p>
<p>Get ready for non-stop lies and exaggerations.  </p>

		<p>As usual, this guy is way off target.  First off, there is no comparison to OJ Simpson.  That is absurd.  Simpson committed a brural double homicide (thats not just a transgression).  </p>
<p>Tiger Woods dominated a popular sport and the same fans and media that adored him are now titillated by his tabloid life.<br>

Tiger Woods acts and talks like an intelligent white person and this is why he is being held to higher standards than Mike Tyson. We all expect poor behavior from the likes of Mike Tyson, we didn&rsquo;t expect that from Tiger.</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t about Tiger Woods athlete. This is about Tiger Woods Golfer. It TW had been a shiftless boxer or NFL slug stepping out on his wife multiple times, white black - whatever it wouldn&rsquo;t be still in the news. This is golf and for an athlete who has promoted as squeeky clean image, its news - sleezy news maybe but news nonetheless. This may go on in the PGA but at least they&rsquo;ve been descrete - at least up until now. We have a pool at work what the final number of er, ladies will be (at least what the number will be on March first). </p>

		<p>I think the guy&rsquo;s fundamentally right.  Healthy Whites are appalled and disgusted by matings between Blacks and Whites, and we&rsquo;re glad to pile on when a Mulatto who has defiled a White woman, even a willing one, is caught with his pants down.  Something wrong with that?  </p>

<p>I knew he was rich, but I had no idea. </p>

		<p>You marry someone, you are faithful. That&rsquo;s how it works. If blacks can&rsquo;t abide that, don&rsquo;t get married. And in fact most don&rsquo;t. Look at all the black kids with only a mom to raise them.  </p>
<p>Tiger, marriage isn&rsquo;t for you. Despite your Stanford degree, you are a mongrel. Leave white women alone unless they are whores, which I understand are most of the women you slept with. </p>

		<p>Does it occur to the average White male that every time they buy tickets to a basketball game, buy products that are endorsed by black athletes or watch a black athlete on TV that they are helping to exterminate the White race?  It might sound incredibly oversimplified to some people but it&rsquo;s true.  Their participation is making these people millionaires who will in turn go out and buy themselves a White wife.  I don&rsquo;t think a woman like that would give him the time of day if he didn&rsquo;t have millions. </p>

		<p>In the original story it is alleged that Tiger is &#8216;handsome.&rsquo; Somebody posted on a similar story a couple days ago that he looks like a chipmunk and that is accurate.</p>
<p>One thing this matter illustrates is that many attractive women, his wife included, would sleep with a burlap sack dummy if it were stuffed with hundred dollar bills.</p>

		<p>Another comment somebody made previously is that these dalliances were not pick up affairs but paid sessions with women moonlighting in their own lucrative but clandestine side business. A couple pornstars who apparently also sell &#8216;escort services&rsquo; are now making credible claims of sleeping with him (video excerpts with allegations made months before the scandal came to light).  </p>

		<p>How is Tiger Woods any different from Jack Johnson, when you come right down to it? Johnson, of course, deliberately pursued white women as a way to &#8220;stick it&#8221; to white America, at a time when the country was more race conscious than it is now. He didn&rsquo;t have the backing and adulation of the MSM then, but that didn&rsquo;t stop him from dating and marrying cheap prostitutes and slapping them around.</p>
<p>Woods was stuffed down our throats 24/7/365 by an adoring media who followed his every move and utterance. Now, it turns out, he has several white mistresses in the drydocks in addition to his wife. Now, that same media suddenly feels betrayed.<br>
Woods has earned billions of dollars - virtually all of it from white golf fans and corporate America - and these Bantus are running around and screaming about how racist golf is, and how we should all mind our own business, because Tiger Woods can&rsquo;t keep it in his pants.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t these the same Bantus who told white America that we must get involved in South Africa, Rhodesia and Darfur, Sudan? </p>

<p>Change all the references to Tiger Woods to &#8220;Obama&#8221; and you have a very close political parallel.  Woods, of course, is a fly speck on history whereas the other is destroying a nation.  </p>

Seriously, if it was some clown from Motley Crue or Ronnie Wood, no one would give a toss. Tiger has obviously been living a lie; he&rsquo;s supposed to be a nice guy / family man etc. That&rsquo;s the image he has chosen to give to the world so he can continue to rake in the cash&hellip;I&rsquo;d say a lot of &#8216;racist and sexist&rsquo; golfers from the past had the brains to be discreet - Tiger has been caught out&hellip;and then some.</p>

<p>    Come on, Tiger Wood was deified as a modern day God in a mostly white sport. Tiger was a liberal dream and a poster child for multiculturalism. This is why so many liberals are upset with the criticism he&rsquo;s been receiving. America loves to see their idols fall and be humiliated. It&rsquo;s a national characteristic. The man is a great athlete but no role model in his private life  &mdash;  admit it and move on.</p>

		<p>Blacks can only be out &#8220;victimed&#8221; by the Jewish people.  By the way, Jason, because Tiger is a protected species in America (a minority), and Elin is a Viking Nordic species, She can be charged with a hate crime for the attack.</p>
<p>That makes as much sense as your article.  </p>
<p>Tiger has broken his word.  He is a liar, a whoremonger, and adulterer.  Old words still mean something to those of us who believe in morals and ethics.  Most of the men I know practice those old beliefs, of course I don&rsquo;t hang in the hood or in hollywood.</p>

		<p>What I get from this expose, is that Tiger is human and therefore should be forgiven for his numerous transgressions.  That is ludicrious and stupid.  One infidelity is bad enough, but it appears that Tiger has been cheating since he said I do.  </p>
<p>Is it me or does it not seem like black atheletes have a proponderance of infidelity unlike any other race of people.  I know that white atheletes cheat and while I am not a big sports fan of any sport, I can&rsquo;t for the life of me think of one white athelete who has scored as many infidelities as Tiger has in the relatively short time he has been married.</p>
<p>But it is equally not surprising that Jason Whitlock would defend Mr. Woods as in that we should just look at where Tiger was raised, as if that is an excuse.</p>

		<p>To Gayle (Post # 24):</p>
<p>I agree, blacks have a penchant for not only cheating on their spouses, but also for having multiple families. Consider:</p>
<p>Calvin Murphy of the NBA fathered 13 children by nine different women during his NBA playing days. This was brought out when one of his children sued him for child molestation a few years ago.</p>
<p>Robert Parish of the NBA was known for paying child support upon demand, not even going through the motions of contesting it. So if Chyneather sued him, claiming he was the father of little son Quintafricanus, he would pay child support, no questions asked.</p>
<p>Gayle, the only white guy I know who even approaches these guys is Wade Boggs, and even that was with only one woman, Margo Adams.</p>
<p>Joe Namath was a playboy, of course, but he did most of his extra-curricular stuff when he was single.</p>

		<p>For God&rsquo;s sake, can&rsquo;t the MSM knock off this ridiculous brou-ha-ha about Tiger Woods?</p>
<p>His life-style pales in comparison with any number of rock-stars and Hollywood types.</p>
<p>What everybody&rsquo;s really upset about was the image they wanted to believe in with Woods turned out to be something less than the truth.  I can see all the sanctimonious Lutherans and Methodists nodding approvingly and remarking, &#8220;He seems like such a nice black man.&#8221;  So now he&rsquo;s Elmer Gantry.  Big deal.</p>
<p>What everybody&rsquo;s really upset about is that they feel as though they&rsquo;ve been had, though so far it seems that all that happened for sure was that he got the hell beat out of him by his wife, which would seem, on balance, to be adequate retribution for his sins.</p>
<p>Had Woods been a boxing champion this little episode would have been laughed off, dismissed, and forgotten within forty-eight hours.  Of course, boxing&rsquo;s now a &#8220;black man&rsquo;s sport.&#8221;</p>
<p>But golfing&rsquo;s still a white-man&rsquo;s sport, much like tennis, a sport so civil and genteel that raucus cheering is considered gauche in the extreme and can actually get noisy spectators forcibly removed from the audience.  </p>
<p>Woods looks like he might make a pretty good welter or middleweight.  Maybe it&rsquo;s not too late for a career change.  </p>

<p>&gt; Is this sarcasm, or are we to believe that Sweden has an over 50% divorce rate?  It doesn&rsquo;t.  This writer is using the stereotype of the loose Swedish blonde to make this statement.  ONCE MARRIED, Swedes and Europeans in general stay married and true.  Moreso than North Americans or even English speaking cultures.  They have cultures that believe that there is a clear line and set of accepted behaviors in both conditions; Have fun when you are young and single, then get married and serious.

		<p>Has the MSM really &#8220;turned&#8221; on Tiger? I don&rsquo;t think so. They are doing just what they always do in situations like this: exploit the situation to the fullest in order to increase viewer-ship. For all the sensationalism, it is nevertheless true that the MSM has exposed Tiger for the faithless lecher that he really is. <br>
I would point that the sports media has protected Tiger Woods&rsquo; image for a long time. A recent article in Sports Illustrated exposed the fact that Tiger often throws childish tantrums, curses and spikes his club when he makes a poor shot. None of this behavior made its way onto the TV screen when golfing events were covered by  ESPN and other sports networks. Could it be that the networks were interested in maintaining the squeaky-clean image of a famous mulatto golfer because they are racists? Surely a white golfer in this genteel sport who acted like such a spoiled brat would have been exposed long ago and never would have been able to make a billion dollars through product endorsements.<br>
The media made Tiger Woods and now they&rsquo;re breakin&rsquo; Tiger Woods. </p>

		<p>When speaking of a black it seems it is <i>de rigueur</i> to comment that they are good looking and intelligent  &mdash;  anything to pump them up.</p>
<p>I wonder about the statement that Tiger Woods is a billionaire. In May, <i>Forbes</i> listed the wealthiest black Americans, and stated that Tiger Woods was worth about $600 million. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/cne4zo" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/cne4zo</a></p>
<p>A few months later, there is this (https://tinyurl.com/yegsuta) saying that Tiger made $10 million and is now a billionaire, the first sports figure to do so.</p>
<p>Does it really seam possible that his wealth could jump by $400 million in a few months? If he truly is a billionaire, it seems that <i>Forbes</i> was likely way off in its estimate back in May. I tend to doubt that.</p>
<p>Is saying Tiger Woods is a billionaire just one more attempt to inflate blacks?</p>

		<p>Coagitator:</p>
<p>It might have been you, but at one point last year, a post here at AR suggested that the way for whites to smooth things over with black co-workers is to act enlightened and educated by every little stupid and non-sensical thing they say.  To enhance the effect, the poster suggested, take out something, e.g. a cell phone with notepad capabilities, a smart phone, a mini voice recorder, or pen and paper, and write down what they say, or pretend to.  I tried it, and it&rsquo;s worked pretty well.</p>
<p>A corollary to that is if you have a minor run-in with a black, you should make everything your fault, even if it was his/her fault, or both of you were to blame.  I had the circumstance to do that yesterday, when I was picking up a few items from the Kroger in Carbondale.  I didn&rsquo;t look where I was going, and I ran into some old black man who was a bit drunk.  We said sorry to each other, and went on our separate ways.  A few minutes later, he must have searched me out, b/c he walked up to be rather quickly, claimed his eye was hurting, and threatened to beat me up.  (Not his exact words).  I apologized again, by saying that I wish I would have watched where I was going.  That diffused his anger, and he went away.  I had to repeat the process after he confronted me again on the way out of the store, he was loitering around the exit with two other black men of his age, both of them seemed a bit drunk, too.  I think he was playing the ghetto lottery, i.e. he wanted to rumble with me so that he can sue Kroger for any reason.  I called the security guard a little while after I got home, and he told me that those three are always loitering about the store, making trouble.  The security can&rsquo;t do much about them, b/c if they try to throw &#8216;em out, they&rsquo;ll scream racism and hire a lawyer.  And the civil rights laws in this state, the Land of Lenin, favors the favored minorities.</p>

<p>Actually, I think it is the exact opposite in the Marxstream media, they are doing everything they can to downplay the obvious racial aspects of all this. When he married his Swedish breeding receptacle, they all but went into orgasmic rapture over it. A beautiful pure Swede marrying a freakish looking fish-eyed mulatto, it doesn&rsquo;t get any better than that for these transcendental multicultural freaks. Hooray, you go Tiger; breed a whole new crop of hybrid &ldquo;wonders&rdquo; with her!</p>
<p>Moreover, the corporate and media elites just loved rubbing white America&rsquo;s face in their multiracial hero&rsquo;s miscegenation circus. They have made him out to be the perfect little role model, that every white girl should aspire to marry when she grows up and destroy herself, and her racial heritage, in the process. Now, he turns out to be nothing but a typical oversexed mulatto &ldquo;player&rdquo; or &ldquo;pimp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is why they are tearing him down in a feeding frenzy, he is proving to be the rule, not the exception of multiracial utopia!</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s even more interesting is that Tiger could not possibly have been keeping his secret life completely hidden.  The mainstream press had to have known that he was leading a double life.  They do protest too much about &#8220;betrayal&#8221;.  They protected him as long as they could.  It was the internet that blew the lid off.  NEVER trust anything coming out of the regular press, ESPECIALLY if it originates in NY or LA.  I sense a growing desperation in the press as they lose control over their control of information.  Sooner or later, it&rsquo;s going to reach critical mass in a sensational story that has far more implications than a celebrity scandal or even the global warming baloney out of England.  Mark my words: the government will get desperate and try to seize control of the internet at some point.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised that Tiger Woods went for a long string of white blond women.  Successful black men usually do.  What is more disturbing is how many pretty white women are unconcerned that none of their descendants will ever be pretty white women themselves.

		<p> I don&rsquo;t care a whit about Golf, or about Tiger Woods. I think it&rsquo;s preposterous that he makes as much as he does, but I feel the same about most pro athletes. It may be that his wife is a faithful wife, and he&rsquo;s a worthless philaderer contemptuous of her fidelity, or it may be that she&rsquo;s fundamentally a gold digger who married him for the money from Jumpstreet, and now she sees a chance to win the divorce lottery, and is weighing her options. But none of that really matters. What does matter is that she is a race traitor. I can&rsquo;t blame men of other races who want to copulate with white women; white women are the most beautiful, at least visually. The most attractive women of other races are women of mixed parentage, of which part of the mix is white. But white women are still the most attractive. We white men can thank ourselves for accepting the treason of our women, and remaining silent during the decades-long media propaganda blitz to drive them to miscegenation. I can say I&rsquo;ve done my my part to resist it in some respects. I refuse to date a woman of another race, no matter how attractive. I refuse to date a white woman who dates outside her race. Regrettably,  several of the young female members of my extended family have become involved with blacks, with the usual results-preganancy, abuse, and ultimate abandonment. Some of the family has been supportive, but the older members of the family have stood firm and refused to accept these half-breed babies, and the mothers have found themselves ostracized. This is not an easy thing, but it&rsquo;s an important aspect of reclaiming our race and our country, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. There&rsquo;s much more to it, of course, but it&rsquo;s a start. The race traitors have to learn that they can&rsquo;t run home after they&rsquo;ve spit in the face of their family&rsquo;s values.</p>

<p>Actually, I am probably more conservative than Anonymous is.  My family has been Republican since the time of Lincoln.

		<p>I think I owe AR a little bit of apology.  </p>
<p>I made the comment on the first Tiger Woods thread presented at AR after the car accident that unraveled everything that I wasn&rsquo;t too concerned or interested about his personal scandals, nor did I make a link to race.  My reasoning was that he was nothing more than just another guy who just doesn&rsquo;t get marriage, and that has nothing to do with his professional life.</p>
<p>Now comes news today that one of his personal doctors is hooked into the Balco/HGH/doping industry, the obvious inference being that Woods is using performance enhancing substances.  When I heard that news, I thought to myself that this is where things start to matter, because he seems to be cheating in his profession.  </p>
<p>But then it hit me   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re linked.  Why was I foolish enough to think that a man who doesn&rsquo;t care about his marriage vows would be honorable in a sport where honor is paramount?  I should have made the inference from his cheating that the rest of him is suspect.  When I was growing up, I was told over and over again that who you are is inseparable from what you do, and in fact, who you are inevitably affects what you do.  Rotten trees produce rotten fruit, and rotten fruit can only come from rotten trees.  (Generalization there, I know.)  If the fruit is rotten, then tree has to be, and vice versa.</p>

		<p>I think this is a good article (and in case it matters, I&rsquo;m a white girl).    I have a white guy friend who, when the news about Tiger&rsquo;s car accident came out, was bitching that Tiger was a sell-out to the black community because of his white-woman-marrying, talking-like-a-white-guy, Uncle Tom image.  My friend is from West Virginia, but hated it there, moved to Colorado, and deliberately talks without a trace of a southern accent, so he ought to know plenty about creating an image.  I agree with the author of this article: white people culture is partly how Tiger grew up, if he was playing golf all the time.  And who cares if you can tell the author of this article is black?  Does that disqualify him from an opinion?  Tiger has a sex-addiction, clearly, but like that&rsquo;s so different from a whole lot of other celebrities and athletes.  Yeah, it&rsquo;s also just the shock of a guy with such a clean image turning out to be a womanizer.  But for one thing, I&rsquo;m not that impressed with woman who want to sleep with a guy just because he&rsquo;s Tiger Woods, and also, you can&rsquo;t tell me that the wife being white and conventionally gorgeous doesn&rsquo;t have a hell of a lot to do with the outrage/interest.</p>
