<h1><a href="https://canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/11444">Sonia Sotomayor Supreme Court Senorita: A Case of Unapologetic Racism</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Williams, Canada Free Press (Toronto), May 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sure, President Obama&rsquo;s appointment of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court is blatantly racist. Few dispute this fact, even members of the Hispanic community.</p>
<p>The smiling senorita was chosen simply because she is a Latina. If Sotomayor had been a lily-white Methodist from Minnesota, she would not have received the slightest chance for consideration.</p>
<p>Her gender also serves to affirm the patronizing nature of Obama&rsquo;s appointment.</p>
<p>Strange to say, the mass media is applauding the president&rsquo;s appointment not because of Sotomayor&rsquo;s judicial acumen, let alone her rather abysmal courtroom record, but rather because of the fact that she is brown and from the Bronx barrio.</p>
<p>Few commentators note that 60% of Sotomayor&rsquo;s rulings were overturned by the Supreme Court  &mdash;  a fact, as Wendy Wright, president of the Concerned Women for America, notes that should cause legislators to &#8220;pause and take a good look at her record.&#8221;</p>
<p>But a good look at her judicial record is secondary to the good look at her Puerto-Rican ancestry.</p>
<p>Sonia&rsquo;s supporters, however, are quick to point out that she pulled herself up by the proverbial bootstraps  &mdash;  that she went from a housing project to Princeton University.</p>
<p>Few note that Ms. Sotomayor received her education in the heyday of affirmative action  &mdash;  a time when functional illiterates were entry to the hallowed halls of ivy for the sake of diversity  &mdash;  a time when standardized test scores, including law board examinations, were adjusted to compensate for &#8220;cultural disadvantages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Race remains a concern in the Sotomayor appointment  &mdash;  particularly because of her strong ties to La Raza, the Latino answer to the KKK.</p>
<p>As a member of the National Council of La Raza, Ms. Sotomayor said: &#8220;I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion as a judge than a white male who hasn&rsquo;t lived that life.&#8221;</p>
<p>La Raza teaches that Colorado, California, Arizona, Texas, Utah, New Mexico, Oregon and parts of Washington State make up an area known as &#8220;Aztlan&#8221;  &mdash;  a fictional ancestral homeland of the Aztecs before Europeans arrived in North America.</p>
<p>These areas belong to the Latinos and Latinas and must be surrendered to &#8220;La Raza&#8221; once enough immigrants, legal or illegal, come to constitute a majority, as in Los Angeles. Once this is achieved, the current borders of the United States will simply be obliterated.</p>
<p>But the &#8220;reconquista&#8221; won&rsquo;t end with territorial occupation and secession. The final plan for the La Raza movement includes the ethnic cleansing of Americans of European, African, and Asian descent out of &#8220;Aztlan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miguel Perez, a La Raza spokesman at Cal State-Northridge, has been quoted as saying: &#8220;The ultimate ideology is the liberation of Aztlan. Communism would be closest [to it]. Once Aztlan is established, ethnic cleansing would commence: Non-Chicanos would have to be expelled  &mdash;  opposition groups would be quashed because you have to keep power.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, our new Supreme Court appointee and self-professed advocate of La Raza approves of the reformation of the United States, the creation of a separate Chicano country, and widespread ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>This assertion may not raise conservative eyebrows, let alone Christian opposition to Sotomayor&rsquo;s ascendancy to the Supreme Court, save for the fact that La Raza and other Latino activist groups have expressed widespread anti-Jewish sentiments and support for radical Islam. This finding is supported by articles in &#8220;The Voice of Aztlan&#8221; with such lurid titles as &#8220;That Shitty Little Country Israel,&#8221; &#8220;Pat Tillman Got What Was coming to Him,&#8221; and &#8220;Osama bin Laden: the &#8216;Pancho Villa&rsquo; of Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Intrepid columnist Michelle Malkin maintains that all Americans should be aware of the following fifteen facts regarding La Raza (&#8220;The Race&#8221;):</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&#8220;The Race&#8221; supports the issuance of driver&rsquo;s licenses to illegal aliens.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&#8220;The Race&#8221; demands in-state tuition discounts for illegal alien students  &mdash;  discounts are not available to law-abiding U.S. citizens and law-abiding legal immigrants.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&#8220;The Race&#8221; opposes cooperative immigration enforcement efforts between local, state, and federal authorities.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&#8220;The Race&#8221; calls for the immediate removal of fences along the Mexican border.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&#8220;The Race&#8221; joined the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in a failed lawsuit attempt to prevent federal officials from entering immigration information into a key national crime database.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&#8220;The Race&#8221; decried Oklahoma&rsquo;s tough immigration-enforcement-first laws, which cut off welfare to illegal aliens, put teeth in employer sanctions, and strengthened local-federal cooperation and information sharing.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&#8220;The Race&#8221; initiated a lawsuit to prevent Proposition 227, California&rsquo;s bilingual education reform ballot initiative, from becoming law.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&#8220;The Race&#8221; condemned common-sense voter ID provisions as an &#8220;absolute disgrace.&#8221;</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&#8220;The Race&#8221; has opposed post-9/11 national security measures at every turn.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Former &#8220;Race&#8221; president Raul Yzaguirre, Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s Hispanic outreach adviser, said this: &#8220;U.S. English is to Hispanics as the Ku Klux Klan is to blacks.&#8221; He was referring to U.S. English, the nation&rsquo;s oldest, largest citizens&rsquo; action group dedicated to preserving the unifying role of the English language in the United States.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&#8220;The Race&#8221; spawned and supported a poisonous subset of ideological satellites, including Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA). The late GOP Rep. Charlie Norwood rightly characterized MEChA as &#8220;the most anti-American groups in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&#8220;The Race&#8221; has conducted a smear campaign against staunch immigration-enforcement leaders and has called for TV and cable news networks to keep immigration enforcement proponents off the airwaves.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&#8220;The Race&#8221; sponsors and supports militant ethnic nationalist charter schools subsidized by your public tax dollars (at least $8 million in federal education grants). The schools include Aztlan Academy in Tucson, Ariz., the Mexicayotl Academy in Nogales, Ariz., Academia Cesar Chavez Charter School in St. Paul, Minn., and La Academia Semillas del Pueblo in Los Angeles, whose principal inveighed: &#8220;We don&rsquo;t want to drink from a White water fountain, we have our own wells and our natural reservoirs and our way of collecting rain in our aqueducts. We don&rsquo;t need a White water fountain .&nsbp;.&nbsp;. ultimately the White way, the American way, the neo liberal, capitalist way of life will eventually lead to our own destruction.&#8221;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&#8220;The Race&#8221; has honed the practice of the politically correct shakedown at taxpayer expense, pushing relentlessly to lower home-loan standards for Hispanic borrowers, reaping millions in federal &#8220;mortgage counseling&#8221; grants, seeking special multimillion-dollar earmarks, and partnering with banks that do business with illegal aliens.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&#8220;The Race&#8221; thrives on ethnic supremacy  &mdash;  and the politically correct elite&rsquo;s unwillingness to call it what it is. Prominent historian Victor Davis Hanson observes: &#8220;[The] organization&rsquo;s very nomenclature &#8216;The National Council of La Raza&rsquo; is hate speech to the core. Despite all the contortions of the group, Raza (as its Latin cognate suggests) reflects the meaning of &#8216;race&rsquo; in Spanish, not &#8216;the people&rsquo;  &mdash;  and that&rsquo;s precisely why we don&rsquo;t hear of something like &#8216;The National Council of the People,&rsquo; which would not confer the buzz notion of ethnic, racial and tribal chauvinism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sotomayor, let&rsquo;s remember, is a leader of La Raza  &mdash;  an individual who has shaped its policies, its ideology, and its racist demands.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one,&#8221; President Obama said today, &#8220;can oppose this appointment.&#8221;</p>
<p>I oppose it, and, if you are a red-blooded American, you should oppose it as well.<br>

		<p>60% of her rulings were overturned by the Supreme Court. Does anyone have a score higher than that?The 60% figure alone should be the deciding factor to reject her. We do not need a pro reconquista racist on the supreme court, especially at this time.</p>

<p> This is a statement a dictator makes, not an elected President. The fundamental right of opposing this appointment is being pushed aside in favor of appeasing the &#8220;politically correct&#8221; liberals.</p>

		<p>Unlike many others who view this site I have found that the decisions Obama has made to date have been resonable based on the circumstances he faced, or at least there were grounds to argue no one had an alternative that was perfect.  But this decision is different.  This person is a racist and this decision will come back to haunt him at the next election with moderates like myself because the racism is so obvious one is compelled to finally believe he too is racist.</p>

		<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, </p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t concern ourselves with this type of thing anymore. All we have to do is prepare ourselves and our families for the coming hostilities.</p>
<p>This woman&rsquo;s abilities shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue with us. We should have long since moved on from this ridiculous word play, which in itself is only smoke and mirrors obscuring what is important to us. Our survivial and the overall survival of our people and nation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read that quote before, sbuffalonative, and I can vouch for its authenticity. Yes, it SOUNDS like it&rsquo;s made up, but it&rsquo;s I assure you it&rsquo;s real. </p>
<p>Real as Reconquista itself. </p>
<p>As horrendous as the entire quote is, it&rsquo;s the adolescent, borderline-illiterate part at the end that really gets me: </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;&hellip;opposition groups would be quashed because you have to keep power.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
When I read those words I can&rsquo;t help hearing them in the voice of Al Pacino&rsquo;s latino gangster from Scarface. Truly, Tony Montana   &mdash;   with a gun in his hand and his face powdered with cocaine   &mdash;   couldn&rsquo;t have said it better. </p>

		<p>If any Republican brings up Sotomayor&rsquo;s ant-white and anti-American views and associations at the confirmation hearings, his/her political stock will rise!  This is exactly the time to stand up to the Democrats and expose them as the anti-white party.  A Republican who does that will be seen as a hero and guarantee his/her re-election, especially if he/she calls attention to the anti-Semitic bent of La Raza.</p>

		<p>Actually, I&rsquo;m not that upset about Sotomayor&rsquo;s nomination.  Of course, we all knew that the nominee would be a Marxist, anti-white, minority.  Anyone who thought Obama would pick otherwise is deluded.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m mellow about Sonia:</p>
<p>1) She&rsquo;s a liberal and an intellectual lighweight.  So is Souter.  So she doesn&rsquo;t change things.</p>
<p>2) Reports are that she has bad people skills.  If those reports are true, she&rsquo;s again just like Souter.  So nothing changes.</p>
<p>3) She&rsquo;s Puerto Rican and born/raised in USA.  She read Nancy Drew growing up.  That technically makes her more American than the many foreign-born latinos elbowing their way into US politics.</p>
<p>4) She has Type 1 diabetes.  It is highly unlikely she&rsquo;ll live as along as Kennedy or Ginsburg.</p>
<p>We could have been facing a brilliant, charimastic, healthy (i.e. WHITE) dedicated Marxist who would have the potential to re-shape the entire Court for decades.  I&rsquo;m sure the Left has dozens of potential candidates that meet this description.  So, in a way, we should be happy that Obama&rsquo;s knee-jerk racism makes it unlikely he&rsquo;ll pick our worst enemies.  I&rsquo;ll put a Scalia against an affirmative-action minority any day. </p>

Some highligts: her rulings are &#8220;notable for their lack of depth&#8221;. She masks her &#8220;intelectual inadequacy&#8221; by bullying from<br>
the bench. And all you really need to know is that she tried to<br>

years namely the charge of racism by the New Haven Firefighters.<br>

		<p>The same sort of things happen in the UK.  People are appointed to show your own political correct credentials, how NOT racist YOU are and at the same time kick those you BELIEVE are racist in the teeth.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the biggest racists are those who do not ignore the colour or nationality of somebody but make a point of it.</p>
<p>True non-racists would just appoint the best person for the job whether they are black, white, green, male, female, or in between.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t over by far. I still predict that at least one of the current White Male justices will &#8220;retire&#8221; for &#8220;personal reasons&#8221; enabeling Obamaster to appoint another judge. It is very possible that Obamaster may finally be responsible for up to three SC justices.</p>
