			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrick J. Buchanan, buchanan.org, May 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Having lost both houses of Congress and the White House in two straight elections, Republicans are going through an identity crisis, its leaders holding town hall meetings to &#8220;listen&#8221; to the people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Such angst and soul-searching is not the mark of the leader, but the mark of a man suffering from doubt and despair.</p>
<p>Why is the party in trouble? Simple. Dubya got a hold of the keys, got high on neocon hooch, and crashed and rolled the family SUV.</p>
<p>He launched an unnecessary war against a country that had not attacked us. With his utopian No Child Left Behind scheme and his Medicare drug plan, he did his passable imitation of LBJ, and blew a hole in the budget.</p>
<p>Touting globalism, he presided over the loss of one in every four U.S. manufacturing jobs and ran up $5 trillion in trade deficits. He refused to defend the Mexican border against an invasion, then pushed an amnesty for the invaders.</p>
<p>This was no Reaganite. This was the neocons&rsquo; apprentice.</p>
<p>How does the party reconnect with Middle America? How does it win back the Reagan Democrats who went home disgusted?</p>
<p>Become again the party of Frank Ricci.</p>
<p>And who is Frank Ricci?</p>
<p>He is a fireman in New Haven, Conn., with 11 years in the department, who suffers from dyslexia, but nonetheless has pursued his dream of becoming a lieutenant and a captain.</p>
<p>Six months before the promotion test, Ricci quit his second job. He bought $1,000 worth of the textbooks he was told to study, had a friend read them onto tapes to compensate for his dyslexia, studied every spare hour he got, and sat for the test, to compete for one of eight lieutenant slots open.</p>
<p>Frank made it. {snip}</p>
<p>It was after the results of the test were made known that the problems arose. For, of the officers who had made the cut, all were white, except for one Latino.</p>
<p>Concluding the test results would, if used by the department, have an &#8220;adverse impact&#8221; on the black community, New Haven tossed out the results and called for new exams to ensure a &#8220;fair&#8221; outcome.</p>
<p>Thus, because he is a white man whose people came from Italy, Frank Ricci is to be denied a promotion he worked for and won, and be robbed of his American dream by the liberal bigots who run New Haven.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What is being done to Frank Ricci is exactly what was done to black folks for decades. {snip}</p>
<p>Now, what was done to them is being done to white folks. And it is just as wrong as it was then.</p>
<p>In 21st century America, race discrimination endures.</p>
<p>All we have done is switch the color of the victims with the color of the beneficiaries. Today it is white males applying for jobs and promotions as cops, firemen, government workers, who are held back because their color does not comport with the desired &#8220;diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New Haven contends the &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; of the test hurts the black community, proving discrimination. But does the relative absence of blacks in the National Hockey League prove discrimination?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Affirmative action began as a mandate to cast a wider net and ensure all had an equal shot. It has become a mighty engine of state injustice that seeks to remedy the consequences of past racial sins and crimes, by committing new ones.</p>

			<p>Of all the mainstrett commentators Pat Buchanan dares to tell it like it really is.</p>
<p>That essay summed up today&rsquo;s dilemma better than anything I&rsquo;ve read OUTSIDE of white nationalist circles.</p>
<p>This society is a combination of Cultural Marxism and 1984.  Everything is altered to appease their god of diversity&hellip;.whatever that&rsquo;s supposed to mean, and there is very little that occurs nowadays that isn&rsquo;t based on bold faced lies.</p>
<p>A make-believe world has been concocted by people who allege they have a deep desire for &#8220;fairness,&#8221; but their reactions and actions are no more than cowardice, because they haven&rsquo;t the courage to stand up for principle for fear violence may occur and/or they&rsquo;ll lose their comfortable existence.  And they deserve neither peace nor comfort.</p>

			<p>Mr Buchanan is using the soft sell so as to minimize the fear he puts into weak-minded Whites.  Discrimination against Blacks was not wrong, it was an attempt to put a barrier between primitive and civilized peoples.  Look what has happened once the barriers were lifted.  </p>

			<p>Karl: actually blacks discrimnate against whites far more than whites do against blacks if you consider the tremendous amount of crime committed by blacks againts whites.</p>
<p>Blacks complain when a white woman clutches her purse in the presence of a black man.</p>
<p>Yet black men rape white woman with regularity.</p>
<p>Which is worse - hurt feelings or a shattered life?</p>

			<p>Speaking of Jim Crow&hellip;I am against those laws, because that&rsquo;s government poking its nose in people&rsquo;s business.  I also suspect that they were put in place by the &#8220;shadow government&#8221; to garner sympathy for the blacks and make it easier to get the civil rights movement going.  We are all pawns, black, white, whatever race!</p>
<p>You should be able to do business (or not do business) with anyone for any reason.  Government needs to stay out of it.  First the government says blacks can&rsquo;t do this, now it&rsquo;s saying you HAVE to include blacks.</p>
<p>I say to our government, just butt out.</p>

<p>Except whites are still the bad guys even while discrimination is official. The more they discriminate against whites the more they set out to investigate, expose, and prove white evil. </p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t like us, go back to Africa.  Whites have bent over backwards for you while our inner cities have turned into ghettos.  We have poured billions of dollars into your communities and all you have shown for it are gangs, high out-of-wedlock birth rates, drugs, and made it unsafe for anyone to walk in your neighborhoods at night. We have let you infest our youth with your rap/hip-hop culture.  We have taken done European symbols from the public eye because they &#8216;offend&rsquo; you.  We have let you beat us, rob us, rape our women, and have had to be the silent majority.  Are we complaining? Are we fed up with you?  You&rsquo;re damn right we are and the time is long overdue for us to take action.</p>

Karl:</p>
<p>The difference between blacks and whites is that whites create civilizations blacks envy while blacks destroy them.</p>
<p>Look at any city or nation that was first majority white and then majority black. The results are always the same.</p>
<p>While blacks complain how bad white allegedly are, blacks do everything they can to be around whites. If the black man believed anything he said about whites, the black man would be demanding separation. </p>
<p>Blacks are jealous of whites.</p>
<p>Those are the facts.</p>

<p>Bush was a New England blueblood liberal that ran as a conservative Texas good old boy in order to get elected.</p>
<p>He lied about the weapons of mass destruction to get us into a war the way LBJ, lied about the Gulf of Tonkin in order to get us into the war in Vietnam.  He signed into law the &ldquo;Integration of GPS, Digital Imagery and GIS with Census Mapping&rdquo;<br>

He started the government take over of the economy, just before leaving office. His immigration policy was right out of Uncle Teddy&rsquo;s 1965 Immigration Act. He opened the can of worms by being the first president to fund stem cell research. He increased the budget to the National Endowment for the Arts by $18. He grew the government with his Patriot Act that spies on Americans. He created the Dept. of Homeland Security, which has marked all Amren readers as right wing extremist, along with everybody else that listen to talk radio and didn&rsquo;t vote for Obama. Even his takes cuts (which I like) came from another New England blue blood liberal, JFK. And he was a driving force behind the North America Union.<br>

			<p>I won&rsquo;t argue the racist, but I&rsquo;m not a jerk, Trey.  I once though as you did, but personal experience has taught me things my parents and teachers didn&rsquo;t know.  Blacks demonstrably cannot make the grade in White society, and putting a Mulatto in the front office doesn&rsquo;t change the fact.  The average Black functions at the mental level of a White 15 year old.  They are extremely violent, with a homicide rate 11 times that of Whites.  They are sexually irresponsible, with every sort of sexually transmitted disease at epidemic levels among them.  The men don&rsquo;t take care of their children, given that 72 percent of Black kids are born to unmarried women.  By every sort of social statistic, they are a disaster.  A healthy society will take measures to protect itself, and segregation was one such measure.  </p>

			<p> LBJ, lied about the Gulf of Tonkin in order to get us into the war in Vietnam</p>
<p>It was the FRENCH that got us into the Viet-Nam war after WWII. The French wanted their colony back and whined to the U.S. to get the British out. The French released, re-armed and employed Japanese troops as POLICE to arrest Ho Chi Minh and Nguyen Giap and those influential men were pissed at us for the rest of their lives. Ho said he would run us out of Viet-Nam for what we did to him, and he did.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This is no Reaganite&#8221;.  Uhh, Pat, it was Ronald &#8220;Amnesty&#8221; Reagan who legalized several million Mexican illegals the first time around &hellip; Or have you forgotten? Reagan didn&rsquo;t worry about budgets much either, except to blow them. Invasion of the tiny @*$(&$ hole island of Grenada ring a bell?

			<p>   I am so confused how ANYONE isn&rsquo;t able to see the factual correlations being made here. Seriously? Whites are pointing out facts with every example given, (which adds solidarity to their arguement) and the only response we get is &#8220;you are racist!&#8221; 80% of the prison population in the U.S. is BLACK! Yet if cited as an example, the BLACK response is automatically that white officers racially profile, plant evidence, lie, etc. How is it possible that FACTS can in any way be constreud as racist? ALL racism is EVIL! (unless its anti white!) RIGHT?</p>

As if that is that is their downfall and the worst thing that one can be called&hellip;how naive and gullible they have become. Like the sheep being herded over the cliff. </p>
