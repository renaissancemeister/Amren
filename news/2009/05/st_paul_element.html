			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emily Johns, Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune, May 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A St. Paul elementary school has voted to officially change its name to &#8220;Barack and Michelle Obama Service Learning Elementary,&#8221; pending approval of the school board.</p>
<p>Webster Magnet Elementary is piloting a service learning program this year that the school board is supposed to officially approve later this month. The school wanted a new name to reflect its new focus, so the site council made up of parents and community members put the Obama name and &#8220;Webster Service Learning Elementary&#8221; on the ballot for the school community.</p>
<p>Ballots were cast on Thursday by students, staff, and community members, and when they were counted this morning, the Obama name came out on top. The final tally was 526 to 328.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to school board policy, new names of schools, programs, mascots and logos &#8220;shall reflect the diversity of the district,&#8221; and all name changes need to be approved by the school board, &#8220;in consultation with the school community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The school board plans to vote on the school&rsquo;s program change and name change at its meeting on May 19.</p>
<p>Webster is not the first school in the country to change their name to honor President Obama. Ludlum Elementary School on Long Island in New York decided to name itself &#8220;Barack Obama Elementary School&#8221; in November, and a handful of schools nationwide have followed suit.</p>
<p>St. Paul school board member Tom Conlon, the board&rsquo;s sole Republican, said he plans to vote against the name change. He thinks naming schools after politicians  &mdash;  Republican or Democratic  &mdash;  should come at the end of a politician&rsquo;s career, or even life, and pointed to &#8220;Paul and Sheila Wellstone Elementary&#8221; in downtown St. Paul as an example.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at what happened in Anchorage,&#8221; Conlon said. &#8220;They named the airport after [former Republican Sen.] Ted Stevens, and then he got indicted. When this is happening just three months into office, it just seems premature.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Focusing on service</b></p>
<p>Obama won the school&rsquo;s mock election in November by a landslide, and his election as the country&rsquo;s first black president means that in the school where three-quarters of the students are black, &#8220;a lot of people are happy,&#8221; third-grader Tiera Abdullah said, while helping run the voting precinct in the school&rsquo;s media center this week.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not why the school was drawn to the name, Simon said.</p>
<p>Simon brought the service learning focus to the school this year, her second full year at the school. The school was one of the nation&rsquo;s first magnet schools in the 1970s with an &#8220;enrichment model&#8221; where students could pick between dozens of different enrichment programs they would take during the day.</p>
<p>But by the time Simon arrived, it was hardly a magnet school at all, she said, with programming no different than any other St. Paul elementary school.</p>
<p>Service learning provided a chance to set the school apart, and teach kids how to lead a life of service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both the president and the first lady have a message of service,&#8221; said Simon. &#8220;Not only do they talk the talk, but walk the walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When the vote totals were parsed, Obama won the student and parent vote, but the 159 community and staff members who voted favored keeping the Webster name by 57 to 42 percent.</p>
<p>The school name has been around since the 1880s. The school is named after statesman Daniel Webster.</p>

			<p>Honestly, going from Daniel Webster to Barack Obama isn&rsquo;t that far of a fling.  Webster was a free trade racial egalitarian; I don&rsquo;t know if he had an immigration position, but it would follow that he would have been for unlimited immigration from anywhere in the world.  Barack Obama?  Ditto.</p>

			<p>I think these name changes help make it easier for white parents to know which schools to avoid. </p>

			<p>Why would anyone change the name of a school? If a new school were being built, then you have an opportunity to name the school. Only a bunch of German liberals in St. Paul would believe this would be a good idea. (They get extra &#8220;political correctness&#8221; merit badges this way.)</p>
<p>So after the next election, the community can have another ballot and change the name of the school to the new president and his wife, or back to the original name, or a new name. Obviously, the name of the school does not mean much to anyone really&hellip;.it can be changed for no reason at all.<br>

			<p>All the schools in the nation that have rushed to change their names may be in for a surprise someday. I&rsquo;m sure before his 4-8 years administration is over, Obama will have a huge scandal. Then, watch the scramble to undo the harm.</p>

<p>I disagree.  Obama could be caught shuffling prostitutes in and out of the White House or even worse case, we get attacked again because of his stupid and idiotic policies, any schools having changed the name to Obama, won&rsquo;t be changed under any circumstances.  </p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t bet the rent on that contention.  In 1991 an Oxford University college changed the name of its common room from &#8220;Nelson Mandela&#8221; to &#8220;Joanna Lumley&#8221; in honor of the English actress (&#8220;See how the mighty have fallen!&#8221;).</p>

<p>If, as many suspect, Obama&rsquo;s policies wind up failing (esp. catastrophically), I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you see many of his sycophants quietly renaming a lot of the streets &amp; buildings they previously named in &#8220;honor&#8221; of him.</p>

			<p>Obama has been President for a whole 100 days and his major accomplishment to date has been to get us another trillion dollars in debt due to innumerable bail outs and a &#8220;stimulus bill&#8221; (including funding for ACORN and La Raza).  One would think that people would have the decency to wait until the end of Obama&rsquo;s first term, to find out if he&rsquo;s any good, before canonizing him.  But no, he&rsquo;s black, and that&rsquo;s all you need to start renaming schools after him.  Imagine if there was such a rush to name things after George W. Bush a month after this first election.  So far as I know the only proposed renaming of a facility after Dubya is a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/04/02/george-w-bush-sewage-pla_n_94601.html" rel="nofollow">sewage plant in San Francisco</a>.  Now I&rsquo;m an official paleocon Bush hater myself but the contrast between how the media and the public has treated these two equally incompetent shredders of the Constitution and advocates of big government is breathtaking to behold.<br>

<p>This is true now but it hasn&rsquo;t always been so. It is good for White parents to pay attention to the names of the schools, to include the street address. NOTHING is good on any road with the connotation of MLK this or MLK that.</p>

			<p>This historic name change will definitely propell students to new academic heights.  At long last, a method of &#8220;narrowing the gap&#8221;.</p>
