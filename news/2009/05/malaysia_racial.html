<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-asia/20090510/AS.Malaysia.Race.Relations/">Malaysia Racial Ties Fragile 40 Years After Riots</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sean Yoong, AP, May 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To be sure, Malaysia, a Southeast Asian nation of 27 million people, has been remarkably stable since the weeklong mayhem that began May 13, 1969. But as the country marks the 40th anniversary of the riots, its uneasy racial detente is coming under stress.</p>
<p>Ethnic Chinese and Indians, the two largest minorities, have become more vocal in demanding racial equality in part because of growing economic hardships, and Indians staged unprecedented public protests in November 2007. Mindful of the mounting disenchantment, a new prime minister is proposing a partial rollback of a main legacy of the riots, an affirmative action program for the majority Malays.</p>
<p>{snip} As Malaysians have grown wealthier and better educated, they have demanded a more open discussion of race, and the government has acquiesced to a degree. But the shift is also stirring old passions  &mdash;  the Malays and Chinese in particular don&rsquo;t fully trust each other  &mdash;  and therein lies a risk.</p>
<p>Several Malay ruling party officials have pledged to defend affirmative action &#8220;to the last drop of blood,&#8221; and a top Malay newspaper urged Malays last month to &#8220;rise and unite.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bloodshed of 1969, which took at least 200 lives, erupted when Malaysia was still emerging from the legacy of colonial rule, only a dozen years after attaining independence from Britain.</p>
<p>Racial divisions ran deep. The Malays held political power but were largely poor. The Chinese, many of whose ancestors immigrated in the 18th century, had prospered through trade and tin mining. Indians, mostly laborers, had little say in politics or business.</p>
<p>The riots were sparked by politics. Chinese opposition supporters, whose parties made sweeping election gains, held a victory march in Kuala Lumpur and jeered at residents in Malay neighborhoods. The Malays staged their own rally, and in ensuing clashes, mobs armed with pistols and knives roamed the streets, killed people of other races and torched their homes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seeking to curb economic disparities, the government launched an affirmative action program in 1971 that enabled Malays to get into universities more easily, buy homes at reduced prices and enter business through rules requiring many companies to be partly Malay-owned. The main government-funded schools teach in the Malay language, while schools that use Chinese and Tamil get less aid.</p>
<p>Many Malays prospered. Their share of corporate wealth surged from 2.4 percent in 1970 to about 20 percent today, and they make up nearly two-thirds of the population.</p>
<p>The minorities say it is time to wind up the program. Chinese make up a quarter of the population and own about 40 percent of corporate equity. Indians are about 8 percent of the population and have a stake of less than 2 percent, while the remainder is mostly foreign ownership.</p>
<p>Complaints about affirmative action and religious disputes  &mdash;  such as the demolition of Indian Hindu temples on illegal sites by Malay authorities  &mdash;  became more apparent during the tenure of former Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who governed for five years from October 2003. He is credited with allowing more space for discussions of long-sensitive issues in the government-controlled media and on independent Internet forums.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many high-profile disputes are religious in nature. Minorities have complained that Islamic courts  &mdash;  not secular courts  &mdash;  are given jurisdiction in family disputes that involve both Muslims and non-Muslims. Some Malay Muslims consider these complaints as a threat to the status of Islam, the country&rsquo;s official religion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the capital of Kuala Lumpur, office workers from all races work together relatively amicably. Lunch crowds include Chinese women in skirts and Malay women draped in multicolored, loose-flowing dresses. Very often, they can be seen tucking into &#8220;dosa&#8221; rice pancake and curry, an Indian favorite.</p>
<p>Though most people still have friends predominantly of their own race, there is interethnic interaction and respect. For example, many Chinese avoid eating pork in the presence of Malay companions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>History textbooks, referring to the May 13 riots, warn that racial harmony must be nurtured. The last deadly clash  &mdash;  between Malays and Indians  &mdash;  was in 2001 when six people were killed.</p>

			<p>I rcently had the opportunity to hear a man of Chinese ancestry speak reverently of his Chinese nationality.</p>
<p>This man lives in Canada, had emigrated from Malaysia, and had no direct ancestors who had lived in China for at least four generations.  </p>
<p>Where stands a Chinese stands the Chinese nation.  Ex-pat Chinese are eager to show loyalty and solidarity to the motherland and the race.   </p>

			<p>Just yesterday I was re-reading Jared Taylor&rsquo;s piece about Malaysians and majority racial preferences. I think that the Malays are smarter than Whites in America. We give people that are different from us the advantage. They are giving themselves the advantage.Good for them!</p>

			<p>Malaysian Chinese might hate AA but they are less vocal and violent compared to Indians. Indians are the poorest(of the three racial groups) and think pro-Malay affirmative action stifles their growth. </p>
<p>I agree with them, Affirmative Action is wrong, but at the same time those successful Chinese were imported, along with Tamilians, by the British to work on rubber and tin plantations. Did the Malays also conspire to have non-AA reserved spots in medicine and engineering only for the Chinese too?  </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s pretty sad that the Malays had to institute an affirmative action program&hellip;for themselves&hellip;in their own country. The Malay experience should sound a warning bell for Europeans and Euro-Americans. </p>

<p>          The reservation system in Malaysia is based on the <br>
          numbers of a particular ethnic group.  Malays make up<br>
          60% plus whereas Chinese make up 30%.  Indians are <br>
          only 7%.   Quotas are based on these numbers.  </p>
<p>          For example, out of 100 seats, 60-65 seats will <br>
          automatically go to Malays because of their race just<br>
          like that.  Another 30-35 seats will go to the Chinese<br>
          because of their somewhat large population.    </p>
<p>          Only around 5 seats will be left for the Indians.  </p>
<p>          In other words, due to their much smaller demography<br>
          they are at a disadvantage in a system that favors<br>
          comparatively large minortites and majorities.   </p>
<p>          Starting a private business is also not so easy since<br>
          business licences will be awarded on the basis of race<br>
          and color as well.   </p>
<p><br>
          Affirmative action for minorities against a majority<br>
          undermines the majority.  Affirmative action for a <br>
          majority against a minority, particularly a very small<br>
          one undermines the minority.  </p>
<p>          So in a nutshell, AA is an undermining force for <br>
          any group subjected to it under any circumstance.<br>
             </p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.</p>
<p>Whether the native population is smarter or dumber doesn&rsquo;t matter, the Chinese and Indians should go home to their ancesteral lands and allow the Malays to have their own.</p>
<p>This is just another diversity project with different players that has gone wrong, as diverse societies eventually do&hellip;.and always will&hellip;.everywhere.</p>
<p>A much more violent repeat of 1969 is in the offing as the world economy continues to deteriorate.</p>
<p>China, and India will be hit the worst:  China from a lack of food and water, and India for the same reason, plus they have a diversity situation there that is just waiting to strike like their many cobras.</p>

<p>I suppose the English, Germans, Irish, Italians in the US will do likewise. Afterall if the Chinese, who have in been in Malaysia for longer than most whites have been in the US, should go home then so should whites return to Europe.</p>
<p>And if we discuss morality - the Chinese at least did not <i>invade</i> Malaya and do to the Malays what whites did to the American Indians. So if we consider the moral perspective, it could well be argued that the Chinese have more right to be in Malaysia than whites have to be in the US.</p>

<p>          Nonsense, <br>
          Indians in India are related people racially, <br>
          culturally, spiritually and civilizationally for the<br>
          most part.  Indian &#8220;diversity&#8221; is a homemade variation<br>
          that has roots and connections in the Indian soil.  <br>
          Indians are compatible with one another, so there is<br>
          no real problem.     </p>
<p>          </p>
<p>          America&rsquo;s diversity dilemma is indeed due to the fact<br>
          that you guys have incompatible races and cultural <br>
          mentalities that ultimately originated in some other<br>
          part of the world with no roots or connections <br>
          with one another or even in America itself.  Hence,<br>
          you have a problem.  The situation in your country is<br>
          vastly different than the one in our country.  </p>
<p><br>
          Also, Indians were lacking food and water even 60-70<br>
          years ago.  The condition then was much worse than <br>
          it is today.  Even then they were able to pull <br>
          together peacefully and make some progress on this<br>
          front.      </p>

			<p>I have to agree with Anoraj, to a degree anyway.  India has its problems, but they learned from the British, they did not waste the experience of colonialism.  They have established within their country of a billion peasants or so, a modern nation of a couple hundred million.  That&rsquo;s enough to keep them progressing.  Compare them to the Arabs, who have wasted most of the trillions of petrodollars that came to them.  What have they to show for it?  Gigantic towers in Dubai, designed and built by outsiders, strictly for show.  </p>

India&rsquo;s &#8220;Untouchables&#8221; Face Violence, Discrimination<br>
Hillary Mayell<br>
for National Geographic News</p>
<p>June 2, 2003<br>
&#8220;More than 160 million people in India are considered &#8220;Untouchable&#8221; &mdash; people tainted by their birth into a caste system that deems them impure, less than human. </p>
<p>&#8220;Human rights abuses against these people, known as Dalits, are legion. A random sampling of headlines in mainstream Indian newspapers tells their story: &#8220;Dalit boy beaten to death for plucking flowers&#8221;; &#8220;Dalit tortured by cops for three days&#8221;; &#8220;Dalit &#8216;witch&rsquo; paraded naked in Bihar&#8221;; &#8220;Dalit killed in lock-up at Kurnool&#8221;; &#8220;7 Dalits burnt alive in caste clash&#8221;; &#8220;5 Dalits lynched in Haryana&#8221;; &#8220;Dalit woman gang-raped, paraded naked&#8221;; &#8220;Police egged on mob to lynch Dalits&#8221;. </p>
<p>(snip)</p>
<p>Arnoraj: &#8220;Also, Indians were lacking food and water even 60-70years ago. The condition then was much worse than it is today. Even then they were able to pull together peacefully and make some progress on this front. &#8220;</p>
<p>ice:  The situation concerning natural resources has never been worse than it is  today.  Any country that is overpopulated, as  India and China, are disasters waiting to happen.  Food riots, water scarcity, internal conflicts, will occur spontaneously over minor issues when not enough bread can be found and very little water to quench the thirst of over a billion people.</p>
<p>Shall I give you more examples like the above, plus armed conflicts within the country and the situation with Pakistan that is set to explode any day now?  I can, you know.  Many more.</p>
<p>In effect, you are saying this country is bad, while India is the epitome of success.</p>
<p>But, let me cut this short by asking you this one question:  &#8220;If things were so good in India, then why did you leave?  Why did you come to our country and add to the multicultural problem that you yourself described?</p>

<p>Why? There is no similarity.</p>
<p>Whites here in America, as in South Africa, settled a wilderness, and pushed nobody out.  If you are referring to the PC dogma that whites &#8220;stole&#8221; Indian land then you are ignorant of history, my friend, and have eagerly lapped up the propaganda disseminated by our Cultural Marxist enemies here who wish to deconstruct our society.  And you do so quite gleefully, too, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>For the most part it was the Indians who greedily trekked to where the white man&rsquo;s settlements were in order to steal his livestock and other assets.  They committed atrocious massacres in the process of that also.  </p>
<p>The Indians started an unnecessary war with the white man and got smashed for their underhandedness.  Now, all they can do is do as all of you non-whites do, and that is to whine about some kind of alleged injustice.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if we discuss morality - the Chinese at least did not invade Malaya and do to the Malays what whites did to the American Indians. So if we consider the moral perspective, it could well be argued that the Chinese have more right to be in Malaysia than whites have to be in the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Chinese and Indians most certainly DID invade Malaysia, just as the Mestizos invaded our land, trying to push us out, and which your kind is trying to do to us also. </p>
<p>China is a decadent country that is going to realize ungodly shortages of food and water in the next few years.  Already there have been riots there because of the serious drop in exports now taking place, and with over a billion mouths to feed and water any slightest imbalance in supplies will have the potential to be a catastrophe.</p>
<p>But let me ask you the same question I asked the Indian:  If you think whites are so bad, why did you come to our country?</p>
<p>Of course, the answer is that you came for the same reason he did.  Neither of your peoples have the ability to create a successful society in your own countries, and you come to our land splitting us into tribal factions, criticizing us every chance you get and spitting on our ancestor&rsquo;s graves.</p>
<p>You can whine all you want, but your mere presence is proof of your failure.  If you dislike whites and fail to recognize white accomplishment so much, why do you stay here?  </p>
<p>We have been successful as a result of our abilities; you have not.  If you had been, you would be in your own country right now.</p>

			<p>The Malays have a right to a homeland but the problem for them is they want both a country where they are in charge and wealth. But they can&rsquo;t have both since the Chinese create the wealth. </p>
<p>Posted by Anonymous at 8:50 PM on May 13 </p>
<p></p>
<p>         The only basic reason why Chinese are successful in<br>
         business in these South-East Asian countries like <br>
         Malaysia, Indonesia ect is due to a combination of  <br>
         total ineptitude of the Malays as well as the fact that<br>
         Chinese generally tend to be much better connected <br>
         at an international level.  For example, they have <br>
         Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan where they have <br>
         family/extended relatives to bank upon for funds and<br>
         other type of material support.    </p>
<p>         <br>
         This insulates them from their non-Chinese host govts<br>
         when they pursue discriminatory policies as well as<br>
         enables them to bribe a racist, hostile govt to act<br>
         somewhat in their favor in certain matters, like the<br>
         economy for example.  That is the reason for the <br>
         Chinese control of the South East Asian economies. </p>
<p>       <br>
         The Chinese in Malaysia are aided by financial support<br>
         through their international networks with other Chinese<br>
         enclaves like Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan ect.  <br>
         They have external supports to prop them up in a <br>
         hostile environment.  That is the only reason why they<br>
         are able to get around the affirmative action policies<br>
         of the largely Malay govt.     </p>
<p><br>
         Why are Whites suffering in Africa nowadays? <br>
         Whites are much smarter than Blacks but Whites today<br>
         no longer have political power nor any international<br>
         support from any extended/national White family <br>
         outside of Africa.  Add to the fact that Whites are<br>
         also a small minority in Africa.  This is the basic <br>
         reason behind White decline there.  </p>
<p><br>
        However the Chinese immigrants in the West like America<br>
        Canada ect are a big threat to the continued  <br>
        independance and even survival of White people as free <br>
        people because they will try to do the same thing here<br>
        as they have done to the SE Asian countries.  With <br>
        their external financial backing, they are no more than<br>
        a 5th column for the projection of Chinese imperial<br>
        power over other lands by way of the vehicle of <br>
        economy.   Whites would do better to just shut them <br>
        out completely from their countries.   </p>
<p><br>
        I am not a White person by the way but that need not <br>
        stop me from wishing White people all the very best.<br>
        <br>
 <br>
        Kind regards to all the White people.  </p>
