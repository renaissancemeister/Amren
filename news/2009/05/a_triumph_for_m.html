<h1>A Triumph for Multiculturalism Over Democracy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barbara Kay, National Post (Toronto), May 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Now that its battle on free speech issues with certain Human Rights Commissions is settled, you&rsquo;d think Maclean&rsquo;s magazine would be the last to accuse anyone of thought crimes.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a delayed case of Stockholm Syndrome, but a Maclean&rsquo;s poll-based feature story in the May 4 issue, &#8220;Divided by religion: What Canadians think of Sikhs, Jews, Christians, Muslims .&Nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#8221; reads as though conceived and interpreted by the very HRCs that harassed the magazine.</p>
<p>Like the HRCs, the article assigns a pre-emptive judgment of racism arising from opinions rather than any actual racist speech or acts: Readers are informed at the outset that Canadians hold &#8220;deeply troubling biases&#8221; because fewer than one in three Canadians &#8220;can find it in their hearts&#8221; to view Islam or Sikhism in a positive light.</p>
<p>This Angus Reid poll, a survey of only 1,002 randomly selected Canadians, does not seek to offer a disinterested overview of Canadians&rsquo; views on religions other than their own. Rather it is a foregone conclusion cloaked in the respectability of scientific methodology, &#8220;proving&#8221; that Canada is a racist society.</p>
<p>Through selection bias the poll reveals what &#8220;we&#8221; think, but not what &#8220;they&#8221; think. It permits &#8220;old stock&#8221; Canadians (Christians or Canadians of Christian heritage) to be held up for public shaming. But the views of specific minority groups such as Muslims, Sikhs and Tamils  &mdash;  who might have revealed themselves to be insufficiently celebratory of religious diversity  &mdash;  are spared public exposure.</p>
<p>One of the poll&rsquo;s many weighted markers for intolerance is that far more Canadians point to Islam than to Christianity as a religion that sanctions violence. Maclean&rsquo;s thus unreasonably penalizes objectivity, implying it is bigotry to acknowledge world events, and racism to honestly assess cultural outcomes over history.</p>
<p>Of the many features offending against minimal standards of objectivity in this poll, two stand out as especially discrediting.</p>
<p>One is Maclean&rsquo;s&rsquo; solicitation of editorial commentary on the poll numbers from Ihsaan Gardee, executive director of Islamism-supportive CAIR-Can. CAIR-Can has never repudiated Islamic terrorism and fellow-travels with the Muslim Brotherhood. The Brotherhood is openly committed to the promotion of stealth jihad, and is universally acknowledged as the intellectual fountainhead of Sunni Islamic radicalism. No media organ should invite such an extremist institution to pass moral judgment on Canadians.</p>
<p>The other is Maclean&rsquo;s&rsquo; overt editorial criticism around the very low level of acceptance for shariah law. Hostility to officially sanctioned shariah law is falsely linked here with negativism toward Muslims. In fact Canadians&rsquo; opposition to shariah represents a wholesome rejection of Europe-style cultural suicide.</p>
<p>It is offensive that Canadians should be implicitly labelled racists for upholding democratic ideals over willfully blind multiculturalism. To regard the phrase &#8220;clash of civilizations&#8221; without ironic quotation marks is not a sign of hostility toward individual Muslims. On the contrary, national self-interest demands that we view Islamism and the dangers posed by radicalized Muslim youths with dread.</p>
<p>Sensationalizing and condemning Canadians&rsquo; thoughts around other religions or cultures is a socially unhealthy impulse. If thoughts were the equivalent of action, it would be easy, by polling our sexual fantasies, to conclude we are a nation of perverts. To what constructive end in either case?</p>
<p>Our deeds are all that matter. By that measure Canada is probably the least racist society on Earth. Ironically, it is because old-stock Canadians display racist behaviour so infrequently that desperate HRCs have been driven to persecuting thought crimes  &mdash;  as Maclean&rsquo;s should know.</p>
<p>So enough with these divisive show-trial polls that undermine heritage Canadians&rsquo; cultural confidence, while validating minority grievance-collecting and entitlement. They are lose-lose projects.</p>
<p>It is the norm amongst academics to teach that only white Christians can be racist. But surely Canadians are entitled to expect better from Maclean&rsquo;s. And surely, having itself passed an ugly few hours with Big Brother, Maclean&rsquo;s should cleave to intellectual integrity as if its very life depended on it.<br/>

			<p>&#8220;Poll designed to show that Canadians are &ldquo;racists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is such a shame that we have pollsters who purposely conduct a poll to dishonestly support their own biases.  </p>
<p>There are a great number of racists in Canada, but unfortunately they are all non-white.</p>
<p>How many times have we heard from non-white Canadians who complain about some policy that doesn&rsquo;t give them special privileges and seeks to denigrate white Canadians?</p>
<p>Anti-white racism is getting to be a real problem throughout the world, just as the Russian diplomat asserted, and it is beginning to reach a very hateful crescendo.<br/>

</i><p>This is a point I have made repeatedly: in our day and age white people are far less hostile to non-whites than the other way around, and yet the societal bugbear called &#8220;racism&#8221; used as a bludgeon against all white people is never going to be interred because too many people (both white and non-white) in the postmodern West depend on its alleged continued existence for their &#8220;livelihood.&#8221;  And as &#8220;overt racism&#8221; (such as for example, open use of racial epithets&hellip;by whites, of course) diminishes, the agencies tasked with fighting &#8220;racism&#8221; will feel obliged to go after ever more marginal and ambiguous alleged instances of &#8220;racism&#8221; (such as attitudes towards immigration, language use, etc.)  From there the path is easy to prosecuting people for &#8220;hate speech&#8221; and &#8220;thought crime,&#8221; as indeed is already happening throughout the West. </p></p>

			<p>People in magazine publishing are some of the most revolting white people society has to offer. Their racism against fellow whites rivals that of the most vicious anti-white academics.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all too true.  100 years ago an ambitious young person who could not find a decent job started his own business.  Now they start organizations like SPLC, etc.</p>
<p>Hasn&rsquo;t Morris Dees said his main purpose is to make money?</p>

			<p>Canada is currently facing a very grim future - the branch plant manufacturing economy is collapsing into unemployment, and limited non-renewable energy sources are not going to save the country.</p>
<p>The government has one ace to play: mass immigration to stimulate spending and construction.</p>
<p>Policy papers in favor of continued mass immigration are circulating in the corridors of power, which will become editorials in tomorrow&rsquo;s newspapers extolling the virtues of immigrants and multiculturalism.</p>

			<p>Prime Minister Harper is just another one in a long line of great Canadian traitors!</p>
<p>Canada like the other western european nations is going to see a huge decline in the standard of living and well as huge increases in social problems.</p>
<p>Services that were once reliable and clean will become unreliable and unclean.</p>
<p>To see what is happening is a great source of sadness.</p>
<p>So much for democracy.</p>

			<p>I took statistics in college.  The professor said you can use any research to &#8216;prove&rsquo; something.  If you already have a preconcieved notion about someone or something and you go research, you&rsquo;ve drawn your own conclusions before you even started.</p>

			<p>Margaret, it is amazing how truths like the one stated by Zorba, are so often overlooked. These little gems of insight, if taken seriously by concerned white Americans and other white people in the Western World, would do more to clear up their thinking than hundreds of books on politics, explaining race relations, etc. </p>

			<p>Lets be frank. Racism &amp; xenophobia has always existed among the various human or tribal groups (certainly in Africa). It is an evolved self-defense mechanism that serves an obvious protective purpose. Naturally, since whites live in pretty much all the best places in the world to live in (because they made it that way) non-whites, who are usually prefect racists in their own lands that they have failed in politically, economically, etc, talk whites (bless their sappy souls) into feeling guilty about these natural instincts and having anything but an open borders to immigration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping someday soon scientist will locate the sucker gene in most whites and bioengineer a cure.</p>

<p>So true.  And it&rsquo;s equally obvious that those outsiders who want to get in and take over have every reason to batter that instinct down and label it as wicked and shameful and immoral.  It serves their own purpose to destroy or neutralize that normal protecive instinct so that they can invade a paralyzed host. If you have something nice, they want it.  Wars are waged in many ways! </p>
