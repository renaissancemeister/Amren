<h1>Concern Over Latino Evangelical Leader&rsquo;s Call to Boycott U.S. Census</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Olson, Press-Enterprise (Riverside, California), May 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As immigrant and Latino organizations gear up to urge illegal immigrants to participate in the 2010 census, a Latino evangelical leader is telling them to boycott the count unless comprehensive immigration reform is enacted.</p>
<p>The Rev. Miguel Rivera, chairman of the Washington-based National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders, appears to be alone among national Latino leaders in promoting a boycott.</p>
<p>But his call worries immigration-rights advocates, who say it could lead to fewer services in immigrant communities and hurt efforts to increase Latino political influence. Census population counts are used to shape congressional districts and help determine where federal funding goes.</p>
<p>Local immigration activists are planning outreach campaigns to encourage census participation. The Census Bureau is working with community groups across the country to promote the benefits of filling out the census.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rodriguez said even if a few hundred thousand of the nation&rsquo;s estimated 12 million illegal immigrants do not participate, it could mean millions of dollars in lost funding.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many illegal immigrants fear answering an official government survey like the census or talking with a government employee, believing it could lead to deportation, said Laura Barrera, deputy director for the Census for the Los Angeles-based National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. The boycott taps into those fears, she said.</p>
<p>The 2000 census undercounted the Hispanic population by about 3 percent, Barrera said. The Census Bureau estimates the 2000 Hispanic undercount was less than 1 percent, down from an undercount of about 5 percent in 1990, said Raul Cisneros, a census spokesman.</p>
<p>Barrera&rsquo;s group is launching a Spanish-language media campaign in October to reassure immigrants and others that census answers are not shared with other government agencies. Census employees face fines or jail for disclosing information.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rivera said he is not convinced the census information will remain confidential, despite the law. And he believes that population data from the census can be combined with voter statistics to determine which areas have the largest illegal-immigrant populations, which could lead to harsh anti-illegal-immigrant laws and Immigration and Customs Enforcement crackdowns.</p>
<p>Rivera said he hopes the boycott threat helps lead to a push for legalization of millions of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;If governors want to have that funding in their states, and if mayors want to have that funding in their cities, they need to stop looking the other way and roll up their sleeves and put pressure on Congress to bring about comprehensive immigration reform,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Population data from the census help determine how about $300 billion in federal funding each year is distributed. A smaller population for a city, county or state leads to less funding.</p>
<p>Census data also is used to form congressional districts, which are created based upon total population, including illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>For the first time this year, census forms will be mailed to about 13 million households  &mdash;  about half of all Latino homes  &mdash;  in English and Spanish, Cisneros said.</p>

			<p>If I have this straight, these Hispanic dingbats are going to deliberately deprive the cities and states where they live of federal money, federal money that is spent on them and not us whites.</p>
<p>Just where do they think the money for the programs they&rsquo;re so enamoured of will come from?</p>

			<p>Sounds like a wizard idea to me. Anything that separates the junkies from the dealer can&rsquo;t be bad.</p>
<p>Maybe shrinking government&rsquo;s pocket book will lead to some shrinkages in other areas, such as civil rights policy.</p>

			<p>I agree.  Blacks and Hispanics are hard to count because of the transiency of the former, and the partial illegality of some of the latter.  A true count, or a true estimate, of the black and Hispanic population might get enough whites mad to do something about it.</p>

			<p>OK reverend: </p>
<p>let all the illegals boycott the census,<br>
we wont enact &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; immigration reform,<br>
and come census time we&rsquo;ll just multiply the number of hispanic respondants by a factor of say, 10,000?</p>

			<p>This is a reasonable move on the invaders&rsquo; part.   Some of them realize that white Americans are going to go absolutely bonkers when our government is finally forced to admit that there are about 25 to 30 million illegal aliens here, (not the 11 to 12 million that constantly cited by the media) and that we have, in fact, been invaded.</p>

			<p>Okay fine, boycott the census and there will be less funding for all you illegals and your 15 kids. You want to pretend you&rsquo;re not here, we&rsquo;ll play along, but watch all your cushy public assistance disappear too. Your call. </p>

			<p>Have no fear! In order to get the most accurate numbers possible Obama has hired his friends in ACORN to help w/the census.<br>

<p>And you know that their honesty is beyond reproach.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not just federal $$ at stake. </p>
<p>More importantly, Census determines how many House Representatives each state gets, thereby not just affecting control of Congress but also changing the landscape of the Electoral College.</p>
<p>If Obama &amp; ACORN falsify the Census enough, it will give urban areas a leg up for the next decade.</p>
