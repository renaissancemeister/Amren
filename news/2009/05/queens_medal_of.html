			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), May 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A medal established by the Queen is being withdrawn after it was declared unlawful and offensive to Muslims and Hindus.</p>
<p>The cross-shaped honour  &mdash;  The Trinity Cross of the Order of Trinity  &mdash;  has been handed to distinguished members of the former colony of Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
<p>Cricketers Brian Lara and Garfield Sobers are among those who have received the medal along with diplomats and politicians.</p>
<p>The Christian name and cross are now being replaced with the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago  &mdash;  a circular medal featuring a sun, stars, water and a map of the islands.</p>
<p>The Privy Council, made up of 12 law lords, ruled the merit decoration was unlawful because it discriminates against non-Christians.</p>
<p>Now other honours are being reviewed over their references to Christian Saints or symbols.</p>
<p>The Queen established the Trinity Cross in 1969 and it took precedence over all other decorations except for the Victoria Cross and George Cross.</p>
<p>But questions at the time of its creation were raised over the Christian nature of the words &#8216;Trinity&rsquo; and &#8216;Cross&rsquo;. Some of those nominated for the award have refused to accept it.</p>
<p>After the Law Lords decision, the Maha Saba attorney Anand Ramlogan told local newspaper Newsday: &#8216;It&rsquo;s a vindication of the 40 years of disquiet and unease silently suffered by the Muslim and Hindu communities whose legitimate grievance with the Trinity Cross was flippantly dismissed by successive governments.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Maha Sabha, the Hindu organisation, and the Islamic Relief Centre Ltd have been fighting to get a new non-religious order of merit since 2004.</p>
<p>The High Court in Trinidad and Tobago ruled the decoration discriminated against non Christians but said it did not have the power to invalidate the royal order.</p>
<p>Judge Jamadar said: &#8216;The Trinity Cross  &mdash;  the nation&rsquo;s highest award  &mdash;  is strictly a Christian symbol, and as a result, it discriminates in a multi-religious society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The islands&rsquo; government last year announced a new award the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
<p>Trinidad and Tobago, which gained independence in 1962, is a multi-religious nation with large groups of Catholics and Hindus. Around 24 per cent of the populartion is Hindu, and five per cent is Muslim.</p>
<p>The Queen is expected to visit in November when the islands host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.</p>
<p>A review of the British honours system by the Commons Public Administration Select Committee in 2004 recommended reducing the number of decorations from twelve to four, with the new proposed titles having no reference to the Cross or Christian saints.</p>

			<p>How sad it is to see British elites spitting on their ancestor&rsquo;s graves in order to curry favor with people who hate them and scheme on a daily basis about taking over the country to make it their own.</p>
<p>This is especially appalling given the fact that several published newspaper reports have declared that unemployment has reached close to record levels and all indications are that the situation will accelerate even more in the next couple of years. </p>
<p>The average white Brit will soon be out of work and paying obeissance to people who hate him, and the white self-hating ruling class is daring him to do something about it.  No job and a second class citizen to boot, with more white-hating immigrants on their way.</p>
<p>Appalling.</p>

			<p>This means that next must be The Victoria Cross and The Order of St. Michael and St. George and The Order of the Garter and The Order of the Bath.  Also the MBE and KCB will soon come under fire.</p>
<p>Even though I am not a Christian and an unbeliever by philosophy, I still do not wish to undo national traditions like these that were meant to acknowledge bravery in battle or reward those enhancing British Culture.  It is like changing geographic names and tearing down statues when a new totalitarian regime takes over in a fascist nation.  </p>
<p>Everyone, including all the liberal humanitarians that have received  an MBE or knighthood lately must be in a quandry over this new twist on results of the  certain kind of &#8220;tolerance&#8221; as &#8220;virtue of multiculturalism and diversity&#8221; somehow became chivalric values.  This is leading to an undoing of that same culture and the traditions that created it.  This is truly a case of &#8220;The World Turned Upside Down&#8221; (an old British Martial tune played after defeats (like the defeat of Cornwall at Yorktown)).</p>
<p>Another milestone acheived in the fall of the West.</p>

<p>As usual, it is our cowardly ruling class, not the common folk, who tuck their tails between their legs and run.</p>

			<p>This is the most absurd article I&rsquo;ve read in some time.  I actually almost laughed out loud (which I never do when reading).</p>
<p>As Jared Taylor wonderfully recognizes, but which fact seems to escape the reporter, Trinidad is simply Spanish for Trinity!  So these people are against the &#8220;trinity&#8221;, but are proud members of Trinidad.</p>
<p>The idiocy boggles the mind.</p>

			<p>Well I suspected the British should be the last to find out about this political &#8220;drama&#8221; which has been going on for the last decade in my Island home, the Brits brought them there in the first place to force wages down after the emancipation of slaves!(sounds familiar?)and that their perculiar culture was very anti-black, while the local christian africans showed total loyalty to the British crown in wars since the 1700&rsquo;s to present day Iraq, where one soldier from another nearby island recently won the Victoria Cross!(many local Indians wanted Britian to lose the war so that India would get Independance on Nazi Germany dictated terms like partitioning Fiji, Trinidad, British Guiana, Uganda so they would have Indian &#8220;colonies&#8221; for their new &#8220;state&#8221;) I can actually recall an Indian guy who&rsquo;s first name was ROMMEL!(much like Osama&rsquo;s name being popular with Pakistani muslims in the UK)</p>
<p>The Indian community&rsquo;s political stance was so well known that the British colonial office floated a very Interesting concept in 1945, that local Indians NOT be given the right to vote when the vote became universal in 1946. They were very correct to do so since few Indians locally joined or supported the allied war effort I&rsquo;ve only read about two that did join the Royal Navy or British army. </p>
<p>In 1947 when India finally got its independance with Pakistan/India the local Indian community started to fight each other just like the goons in the homeland some fools waved Pakistan flags while others waved Indian flags back with the usual fist fights and insults yes the British truly blessed us when they brought Indian coolies to our shores! <br>

			<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a vindication of the 40 years of disquiet and unease silently suffered by the Muslim and Hindu communities </p>
<p>Muslim &#8216;communities&rsquo; only silently suffer until they have the numbers and weapons to challenge the local authorities, and later, the national authorities if not the ARMY!! The Pakistani muslims are really putting it to England.</p>

			<p>Keeping in mind the offensiveness of the cross to over sensitive muslims, a number of countries will have to change their national insignia, Germany and Portugal come to mind.</p>

			<p>NOW, besides the national insignia of Germany and Portugal having a cross in them, we will have to redesign windows so that the panes are round or triangular with none of those OFFENSIVE crosses in them. England is gone.</p>

			<p>I think the power structure both in the UK and globally want this sort of thing.  The big banking cartels and their allies in the media and corporate establishment.  These so called &#8220;lords&#8221;  much like our senators in the US are &#8220;in tight&#8221; with that power structure that works to merge economies globally and blend the peoples together as well.  Mix the third world into the first and eventually you will have a new people entirely undevoted to nationalism and their will be no more resistance to the machinations of our global banking cartels and their allies who have determined that things need to be different to suit their interests.  </p>

			<p>Folks, I have thought it over.  After much agonizing and contemplation, I have decided to volunteer my services and accept this medal myself - in its original form.  I will not accept it in its new design because I find it offensive.    </p>

<p>Hey, that sounds a lot like the USA!  It is becoming harder and harder to find a job in Los Angeles unless one is bilingual in Spanish.  Forget about a government job, because all of those go to &#8220;minorities.&#8221;  Whites, of course, never need a nice goverment job with a guaranteed pension and health care and retirement at age 55 because we all come from rich families and are so &#8220;privileged.&#8221;   </p>
<p>I applied for a county job once in Houston and when I toured the huge office everyone was Hispanic or black except for one lone white woman.  I didn&rsquo;t get the job, for some reason.</p>

			<p> Is not the UK an officially Christian state, with the head of the royal family being also the head of the Anglican church which is supported by tax dollars?</p>
<p>This is the British honours system, is it not?</p>
<p>What then, of the flag of the United Kingdom, which is made up of the cross of St. George, the cross of St. Andrew, and the cross of St. Patrick (representing England, Scotland, and Ireland)? </p>
<p>Where are the true Brits, those who will fight for their God, country and king as the forefathers did for thousands of years?  Where is the outrage against the very presence of those for whom the most fundamental symbols of Britain are &#8220;offensive&#8221;, and against those miserable, cowardly wretches who capitulate to them? </p>

			<p>Where are the True Brits?<br>
First they were disarmed, and then all this has come down on their heads.<br>
If we, here in the States, are likwise disarmed, the same things will happen to us.<br>
The muslims in the State have been quiet, not because they are so well integrated, but because they know that the white population  is heavily armed, and they are terrified of anyone who could, and would, fight back.</p>
