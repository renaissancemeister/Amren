<h1>College Grad: &#8216;I Wish I&rsquo;d Gone to Prison Instead&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Sullivan, Red Tape Chronicles, May 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hernan Castillo is treading water, trying to survive under the weight of $5,200 in credit card debt and $30,000 in student loans. He&rsquo;s making payments on time, but the Orange County, Calif., resident sees little hope for getting out of the warehouse job he holds and landing a job as an accountant, the field in which he earned his degree. And forget about saving money for a home or retirement. He now firmly believes the money he spent earning a college degree was a waste.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every day I wish I had never gone to college,&#8221; Castillo said. &#8220;It has been the biggest mistake of my life. Sometimes I wish I had gone to prison instead of college. At least I would have learned a trade or two and started being independent once I got out.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Castillo, who is struggling under the weight of both credit card and student loan debt, wishes he knew a lot more about the system before he went to school.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s currently paying $300 per month on his student loans and about the same toward credit cards, but at 30, he feels he&rsquo;ll never get ahead.  There&rsquo;s no hope of going back to school for retraining, and he&rsquo;s already very worried about retirement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could go back in time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When I signed those (loan) papers I never thought it would come to this point. I thought it would be easy to pay it back. I wish I had never gone to college.&#8221;<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve gone to both college and prison.  I distinctly remember college being a better place.</p>
<p>At 43 with a four-count felony conviction, I also feel I&rsquo;ll never get ahead, but married, with a daughter and no debt, I don&rsquo;t mind it too much that I don&rsquo;t get to shoot my old gun collection.</p>
<p>An ex-chemist with 79 US and foreign patents awarded, I work as a welder and auto-mechanic out of my home&rsquo;s garage.  Things are tough all over Castillo.  Get over it.</p>

Black leaders gave blacks the royal shaft when they demanded more blacks get college degrees. Instead of learning trades like plumbing, carpentry, construction (many with high 5 figure earnings) blacks were forced into the college mold which they didn&rsquo;t fit.</p>
<p>As I like to say, the best way to destroy blacks is to give them what they want. They are their own worst enemies. They create the hell they inhabit.</p>
<p>Right now, here in Buffalo, NY, we&rsquo;re experiencing a building boom. The vast majority of skilled construction workers are white. Blacks are fumming that they were left out. Of course, they had the choice to enter these fields but they didn&rsquo;t. There are minority construction trade groups that can&rsquo;t find young black men willing to learn these trades but still blacks complain how unfair &#8216;the system&rsquo; is.</p>
<p>I listened to a black talkshow discussing this issue with the head of one of these minority trade groups. The way he described it, it takes a great deal of effort to keep any black who shows up focused on learning and completing the courses. The truth is few stick with the program to completion.</p>

			<p>Regardless of his race, and even before the economic downturn, you hear a lot of this these days. A college degree just isn&rsquo;t worth what it used to be. </p>
<p>To complicate matters, student loans are exempt from all normal consumer rights and protections. It&rsquo;s criminal what they&rsquo;re doing. Raising tuition so high that only the wealthy can afford it without massive loans with usurious interest rates. Yet young adults are inculcated with the idea from the day they&rsquo;re born that a college degree is the only way to prosperity.</p>
<p>To me, the real racial angle on this story is why isn&rsquo;t a college degree enough to get a decent job anymore? Where have all the jobs gone? Who is doing them? The answer involves Mexico, Mexicans, India and Indians, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>If I could do it all over again, I would chose to forgo college. Now I&rsquo;m stuck with a debt for life. So much for the American dream.</p>

			<p>I have a B.A. and M.A. in a liberal arts field. I am completely convinced that too many kids are going to college without any idea why. Especially in the liberal arts. One reason why political correctness infests the liberals arts is the students could care less about what they are being taught. They just want the credits and the degree. Most of them would have been happier learning hard skills and being out in the world making a living. </p>

			<p>Hey, don&rsquo;t be too hard on him.  He&rsquo;s trying to make a living under a crushing load and he&rsquo;s not a gangbanger or felon.  At least he studied something useful, accounting, and not some politicized major like &#8220;critical queer studies&#8221; or some such nonsense.  </p>
<p>This is not a racial issue.  There are way too many people of all races going to college to fatten the higher education blob, graduating with huge debts and expectations that can never be realized.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m white, have an MA and have had a professional level career, but have never been good at what I do.  I wish I had never gone to college either.  </p>

			<p>He&rsquo;s not the only one.  Like many of us who went to college, he will never get out from under.</p>
<p>I know 2 accountants.  They are in their early 40&rsquo;s.  They got accounting jobs right out of college.  They went to expensive schools.  They are still paying off their student loans.</p>
<p>Castillo should join the military.  With a BA he has a good chance to make it to officer training.  The military can probably use his accounting skills. He could have his loan paid off in 5 years if he lived with several roommates.</p>
<p>He could also get his teaching credential and teach high school math.  That&rsquo;s what most American engineering grads have done because being Americans they have no chance for a job that is monopolized by Asian and Indian immigrants.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t see what the racial angle is here, or, if there should even be one? In fact, I don&rsquo;t think there is one&hellip;Why? </p>
<p>Because I am in the same damned position and 27 years old. I spent four years of my life on a bachelor&rsquo;s degree and have nothing to show for it in the way of a good-paying job. And, here I sit, day-after-day struggling to make ends meet and fighting with the U.S. Dept. of Education to have my student loan repayments put on hold. </p>
<p>I spent four years of my life being indoctrinated by self-righteous, anti-white, Marxist professors who did their darnedest to shove their beliefs down my throat. And for what? What the hell did it get me? Everybody I know who was a slacker or a jackass in high school seems to be doing fine with good jobs. I hate my high school guidance counselors who brainwashed me to think that going to college was &#8220;everything&#8221;. Obviously, it was a lie. </p>

			<p>A couple of years ago, an article appeared in a business magazine that thousands upon thousands of Filipinos and other Asians were being trained in U.S. accounting standards.  H-1B anyone?  Outsourcing anyone?  Now you know why he doesn&rsquo;t have a job commensurate with his education.</p>
<p>This is the case with more and more college graduates.  All these students go to college to get useless degrees, because their teachers and guidance counselors tell them they have to go to college.  (Duh, their business is education.  Would a refinery tell you not to buy a car?)  What they don&rsquo;t tell you is that it doesn&rsquo;t matter how educated you are, all that matters is how cheap you work and how slavish you are.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s is where the political left and right are shown to be two sides of the same coin. Consider the following:</p>
<p>One of the mantras of the &#8216;left&rsquo; is diversity (preferably non-white) which also includes non-US citizens on H-1B visas (also preferably non-white).</p>
<p>On the other hand the &#8216;right&rsquo; worships at the &#8216;capitalist&rsquo; alter; note this to be interpreted as &#8220;the goal of business is to mazimize profit&#8221;. And &#8216;nation&rsquo; or &#8216;country&rsquo; or even &#8216;citizen&rsquo; simply don&rsquo;t have a variable in the &#8216;maximizing profit&rsquo; liturgy.</p>
<p>So why is this relevant to Mr. Castillo? Well, he doesn&rsquo;t have a job does he?. Why would business hire a U.S. college grad who expects to make enough to live a middle class life and pay off his student loans?&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;SUCKER.</p>
<p>Also, the bill before congress to allow unlimited foreign doctors to set up practice in the U.S. is, the last I&rsquo;ve heard, still being considered. So if a $30k student loan burden seems a lot just imagine what indebtedness the 8-12 years of schooling a U.S. medical grad piles up! $200k &amp; more.</p>

			<p>College is important because it makes people more cultured, open and tolerant of people who are different from themselves. I don&rsquo;t think I would have dated outside my ethnicity or visited the opera and art galleries every week had I not attended. </p>

			<p>$35,200 in debt?  Why is that such a big deal?  Anyone with a house owes a lot more than that.  <br>
     As for college being a waste, he&rsquo;s right about that.  Smart White guys had better learn some useful skills if they want to eat in a collapsing economy.  As it is, I suspect that all government sponsored training programs will exclude Whites as much as possible.  I do worry that as an underground economy becomes the only real economy, Whites with useless degrees will lose out to Mexicans who know how to weld a little.  I encourage all Whites to scoot down to your local junior college and learn something that will make you worth having around.  JCs don&rsquo;t discriminate,they&rsquo;re cheap, and if you want to pick up some math or chemistry on the side, you can.  To be plain, Whites need to train for their own survival.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s simply ridiculous: $30k isn&rsquo;t an impossible mountain of debt.  </p>
<p>The point of the article is that college is vastly overrated.  The whole university system is being exposed as a sham.  Let&rsquo;s hope it and the prestige of the pukes who run it die soon.</p>

			<p>The wonderful thing about college is you get to learn a lot of fancy schmancty big words that the average un-college educated person don&rsquo;t know so you can confuse them in conversations and THE HUGE SUPPLY OF  &#8220;EXPERIMENTING&#8221; future soccer moms.</p>

			<p>I always wondered why people with degrees always look down upon blue collar workers and everyone else who didn&rsquo;t go to college. Who do they think drives their groceries to the local market, fixes the elevator when they  break, and etc. You don&rsquo;t have to go to college to be educated and articulate. I was educated enough to know I didn&rsquo;t need college.  I was educated enough not to vote for Obama or Mcain. I was educated enough to start  sucessful businesses that earns me a salary close to a heart surgeon. People are so shocked to learn that I&rsquo;m so succesful and I never attended college.  </p>

			<p>All these posts are right on the money.  The entire public education industry pushes kids relentlessly to go to college, and this propaganda starts in elementary school.  Vocational training in the public schools is becoming very rare.  And who profits?  The universities, who keep jacking up tuition at ridiculous rates even if they&rsquo;re getting public tax money to support them, and the loan holders.  The students are increasingly getting worthless degrees, for all the reasons posted here, and are heavily indebted with few prospects.</p>
<p>Tell your children to study a useful trade, and if this requires college make sure they don&rsquo;t go into debt to pay for it; use ROTC and military college funds, scholarships, or work and take longer to get the degree/certification.</p>

			<p>I am also DEEPLY in debt due to student loans (no other debts) resulting from law school.  Law school could be put on a set of DVDs, in my opinion, and those who have the brainpower and motivation could study it on their own.  A few thousand dollars worth of books, study guides, and DVDs with lectures is all you need to gain the knowledge needed to pass even the toughest bar exams (CA, NY, etc.)  But the ABA accredits schools and makes it tough, but not impossible to study on your own.  I didn&rsquo;t know until my second or third year of law school that studying on your own could even qualify you to take the bar exam.  If I HAD known, I would have studied independently and taken the bar exam WITHOUT going to law school for three years.  You can&rsquo;t work for the federal government without a J.D. degree, and you won&rsquo;t get hired by a big law firm, but you can do just about anything else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m middle-aged, but I have to say that my high school counselors back in the late 70s in a good Midwestern high school were absolutely useless.  No one in my family had graduated from college at that point, and I could have used some realistic information.  CLEP tests were available at that time, but I didn&rsquo;t learn about them until I was almost out of high school, and I learned about them from a TV commercial, not from the &#8220;counselors.&#8221;  I could have chopped a year off of college quite easily.  </p>
<p>Another good deal that nobody tells you about is that the &#8220;semester in Heidelberg/London/Salamanca/Lyon,&#8221; etc., costs a LOT less for precisely the same program if you go through a junior college instead of Fancy Pants University.  Typically, the college charges you their regular tuition, and they pay the foreign university part of that money.  The junior colleges appear to charge only what the foreign university charges, or maybe a bit more to cover their administrative costs, but STILL, it works out to be 1/4 to 1/3 the cost.  My kids are in graduate school now, but my recommendation to anybody with smart kids in high school would be to have them take CLEP &amp; AP tests to cut out a year of college, take four years of a foreign language in high school, then enroll in the local junior college just to spend a year in Europe.  At that point, you&rsquo;ll have spent about $15,000, but you&rsquo;ll be halfway through college.  Then, transfer to the best four-year state university that you can get into. </p>

			<p>I think I&rsquo;m the antithesis of many fellow people here; I&rsquo;m a recent high school graduate (a bit over a year ago), but I&rsquo;m not pursuing college. Instead, I chose to work my way up in the trades. I think I was the only one at my school who didn&rsquo;t buy into the &#8220;college guarantees you a future&#8221; sales pitch. Reading this article now, I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t. </p>

			<p>I feel for the guy.  It is very tough out there.  I&rsquo;m working on a Masters Degree while I look for a job.  I am always thinking of what I skill I can add to my resume or certification or new degree.  It isn&rsquo;t easy and maybe expensive but maybe a Masters degree is what he needs.  If not that then is he working on his CPA license?  There is no mention of what he is doing to improve himself and better his chances of getting a job.  If Accounting was a mistake pick something else and move on.  If he stops whining and starts working his luck may change.  Funny too there is no mention what his gpa was.  Did he have a 2.5 or a 3.5? How good of a school did he go to?  There is a ton of missing info here.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a recent law school grad with over $100,000 in debt.  The economy has hit everything hard lately but that doesn&rsquo;t make up for the lies you&rsquo;re told at law school orientation.  They make it seem like you&rsquo;ll be making $65,000 out of the box when in reality the average 1st year lawyer makes more like $42,000 and that&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have a job waiting for you when you graduate.  Guess I shouldn&rsquo;t complain too much though, the law is one area the foreigners/immigrants are not really schooled in&hellip;.yet.      </p>

			<p>College for me cost $5500 per year. I lived at home and delivered pizzas 5 nights a week and earned $900 per month. I paid my own tuition and never went into debt. For too many, going into debt has become a part of &#8220;the college experience.&#8221; It&rsquo;s time we learned better.</p>

			<p>Sad fact is, with Griggs Vs Duke Power and its aftermath..a college degree is a necessity. But for most majors its just a 4 year screening device.</p>
<p>Even highly mathematical majors are in my strong opinion majority screening devices.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not about having a college degree; it&rsquo;s about having marketable job skills. After leaving the Navy I went to college for a while. Some of my friends were earning degrees in Marketing, Communications, and English. I dropped out of college and got a job with a large federal agency. My job is both blue collar and the skill set is fairly basic. My friends were a bit smirky when I took my job. Six months after graduation, with no job offers, they were calling me up and asking if they were hiring at my agency. My daughters recieved the same advice I&rsquo;m giving here. My oldest is finishing up her teaching degree in science education. My youngest is working on her paramedic license and is planing to go on to get her acute care training also. Going foward your skill set is all important. How you aquire that skill set isn&rsquo;t as important.</p>

			<p>There is some merit to the idea that college is not everything or for everbody. Although I am for education, think its a good thing, and as amother poster stated all kids are indoctronated that education is the only way to to ahead. But hard work will make you get ahead also. I have often told a story about a freind of mine,, and I bet all here know somebody without an education that has become rich. My buddy from school was a good kid but slow learner. Quit in 10th grade because he just couldnt keep up. Went to work in a filling station, in the days before mini marts took over. Was good at it and several years later got the chance to lease his own station. Did well and added a few used cars. Did well and added more and newer used cars. Did well and later bought a new car dealership. Now owns several dealerships and has made a fortune before the present crisis hit but he is ok.  All with a 10th grade education. Even today he has no brains for books and writing ect,, but has plenty of business sense. Book brains are not everything, why are not most college professors rich as he is ???  KF     </p>

			<p>The issue here is; not that he wishes he had never gone to college, but that he sees nothing wrong with wishing he had been a felon instead.  That is not civilized thinking.  Nor should it be considered an option.  Sure he owes for college, did someone hold a gun to his head and make him go?  Or did he believe it was a way to have a good life, without considering his skills, actual aptitude, and the possible drawbacks?  <br>
The mentality that everyone should go to college or prison is a truly poisonous one.  It is an individual&rsquo;s responsibility to prepare themselves for their future, or it should be.  The ways things are going we&rsquo;re all going to be government drones, sorted out in our pre-teen years and assigned our future.  Would that have made him happier?  Somehow I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

			<p>My job and my personal pursuits sometimes bring me into contact with high school students, and there have been times when they&rsquo;ve sought my opinion on their future &#8220;plans.&#8221; Oftentimes this involves a mechanical recitation of &#8220;First, I&rsquo;m gonna go to college&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m single and have no children, so I&rsquo;m not sure what guidance they&rsquo;re getting in the high school environment when it comes to continuing their education. It appears though that college is presented as an end in itself, rather than as a means to prepare for a career/profession that suits or interests them. </p>
<p>I have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in mathematics, earned in 1993, and I haven&rsquo;t worked a day in the field. I was very fortunate, in that I attended college on a full academic scholarship, so I don&rsquo;t know the pain that many others do of struggling with student loans. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most important thing I learned in college&hellip;was that I didn&rsquo;t want to be a mathematician. At the 300 and 400 level some of the work became quite difficult, and I didn&rsquo;t feel the same level of interest or motivation that other students did. I had to tutor during my junior and senior years, mainly with athletes&hellip;I learned quickly that I&rsquo;d never be a teacher. Asians were aggressively recruited during my senior year&rsquo;s job fairs; the only viable route for white graduates was to continue straight in to grad school, a definite non-starter for me. </p>
<p>No one ever prepped me for this. I had great grades in high school and an above-average grasp of math (yes, I was a straight book nerd)&hellip;thus, my counselors and parents bulldozed me straight into college. I don&rsquo;t remember anyone ever asking me if a lifetime of numbers was in any way interesting&hellip;</p>
<p>I consider myself fortunate not to have learned this lesson under the terrible burden of student loans. <br>

			<p>&#8220;He could also get his teaching credential and teach high school math. That&rsquo;s what most American engineering grads have done because being Americans they have no chance for a job that is monopolized by Asian and Indian immigrants&#8221;</p>
<p>I was watching a news program about &#8216;Green&rsquo; jobs turning around the economy. The reporter went to a start-up out in California and the employees all looked Indian or Asian.</p>
<p>Why is it all-black employees or all Hispanic employees, or all Asian employees or all Indian employees - and their numbers are growing (the same could be said of neighborhoods and schools also) and the accompanying political and social special interest groups&hellip; why is it these are all considered good and something to work for and be proud of, but whites must always be ashamed, even where no pressures exist to bring this &#8216;solidarity&rsquo; about, and whites are then required to work for more &#8216;diversity&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>I paid all of my students loans off. Been audited 5 times, the last of which the gov owed ME enough to pay off the student loans. Previous tax debt was mailed in the form of arranged payments and I addressed them to &#8220;The INFERNAL REVENUE SCREWUS CENTER&#8221; Chamblis, Ga. That is what got me audited 5 times, the checks were made out correctly though.</p>

			<p>I agree with the guy who commented that all the idiots from high school are doing well now. I have a degree from a liberal University here in Canada, and can&rsquo;t get nothing with it. The only thing you can get with it is teaching English in a  foreign country. I know a guy who is a pretty dumb person, but he&rsquo;s good at the electrical trade. He got his electrical paper trade and now owns his own business. The best I can say is don&rsquo;t go to University, big waste of time. Get a trade like all the dumb guys did.</p>

			<p>Just adding my voice to the choir.  I too wish I had never gone to that silly liberal arts university.  I am out of debt now, but it took me a decade.  I&rsquo;m not making a living doing anything remotely related to my degree, and I could have been paying for a house or something instead of paying for college.  What a waste of time and money.  At least their liberal brainwashing backfired!</p>

			<p>The  problem  is  not  that  Mr. Castillo  wnet  to  college, the  problem is  that  it  cost  so  much.  If  he  were  in Europe or  most other  places he  would  have  had  his  degree just  as  he  had  a  high school  diploma.  Almost for  free.</p>
<p>Nothing  wrong with  learning how  to  reason or  how to read  a  good  book or  read the  stock tables and  op-ed opinion in the  newspapers. More  learning  &mdash;  in whatever  field can never  be  a  bad thing.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t see what he&rsquo;s complaining about.  If he sticks with it and gets out there and networks, an accounting job WILL come along.  I assume he didn&rsquo;t saddle himself with a wife and/or children so that he can move to another city when a job offer is tendered to him.  If he didn&rsquo;t, then he gets what he deserves.</p>

			<p>&#8220;As it is, I suspect that all government sponsored training programs will exclude Whites as much as possible.:</p>
<p>They already do.  </p>
<p>As for Castillo&rsquo;s situation, for many people $30,000 is an impossible mountain of debt.  He pays $300.00 per month for his useless degree.  It&rsquo;s not a house or car payment or a payment for anything useful.  He probably makes about $12.00 per hour. That&rsquo;s about $26,000 per year, $17,000 take home. </p>
<p>If he owns a car and pays California rents and his student loans he is barely making it.  His complaint seems to be not that he has to pay the loans, but that he paid so much for the degree and now has a job that does not require a degree or even a high school diploma.</p>
<p>I was a clerk.  When I started we need 2 years of college and we had to pass a clerical aptitude test.  We were replaced by Guatemalean Indians who spoke neither English nor Spanish and were recruited back in their stone age rain forest village.</p>
<p>So much for education.</p>

			<p>Yeah, I have had a master&rsquo;s degree since 1995.  But, I have only had the four professional certifications that I hold for about 5 years.  Those certifications have done so much more for my career than the degrees ever did, it&rsquo;s disgusting.  And, the company paid for all of them.  The thousands upon thousands of dollars spent on college seems down the drain.</p>
<p>But, hey!!! I&rsquo;m considered an &#8220;educated&#8221; and &#8220;well-rounded&#8221; individual because of the degrees, right?  Whatever.</p>

			<p>Too many people look down on those who work with their hands (AND MIND).  This is perpetuated by the &#8220;gotta go to college to get anywhere&#8221; attitude by the COLLEGES THEMSELVES.  The trades (especially those that require some sort of certification or licensure) are especially attractive.  <br>
Today&rsquo;s college educations are equivalent to what a high school education was 40 years ago, hence, the reliance on &#8220;remedial education&#8221; classes that most colleges offer.  Another aspect of fraud in the &#8220;higher education&#8221; cartel is the lack of standards as to transferability of credits.  There are proprietary schools where it is possible to get equivalent to an electrical or mechanical engineering &#8220;degree&#8221; in TWO YEARS.  This is due to the lack of &#8220;fluff&#8221; courses that most colleges require.  Most (if not all) colleges WILL NOT give credit for classes taken at proprietary schools.  In addition the CLEP (College Level Examination Program) system is not accepted by all colleges.  It is time to break the college cartel system.  <br>
If you want to see what first through eighth graders were able to achieve in this country, obtain a set of the &#8220;McGuffey Eclectic Readers&#8221;.  These &#8220;readers&#8221; were used in the &#8220;one-room schoolhouses&#8221; in the 19th century.  (Yes, they are still available from various sources).  Most &#8220;college students&#8221; would have considerable trouble with the last two books in the set.</p>

			<p>Anyone can learn a trade without needing to go to prison.  Vo-tech classes are actually free for high school students, and community colleges offer all sorts of courses in everything from automobile repair to zookeeping.  Going to prison, Castillo would have been just as likely to be assigned work like slinging hash on the chow hall line or mopping floors and would have merely emerged from the experience older.  The high-speed, low-drag jobs in prison are generally reserved for people who already know how to do them.  <br>
  <br>
And no, Occam, Castillo&rsquo;s education in Europe would not have been &#8220;almost for free&#8221;.  Rest assured, someone would have been forced to pay for it.  TANSTAAFL can be pronounced as a word, but stands for &#8220;Their Ain&rsquo;t No Such Thing As A Free Lunch.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Anonymous 10:50:  That&rsquo;s because most people with the sheepskin automatically think they should make more money than those without, that they deserve it.  So they sneer at well paid working middle class unionized workers.  In spite of the fact that many of their fathers were such workers.</p>
<p>JJ:  It&rsquo;s worse than that.  A high percentage of people with JDs and who have passed the bar aren&rsquo;t even practicing law.  Of those that do, I would bet that most lawyers don&rsquo;t make as much as the US Post Office letter carrier that delivers mail to their houses.</p>
<p>Lawyer 11:18:  That&rsquo;s how most of the Founding Fathers that were lawyers learned the law.  You think they all went to Harvard Law? </p>
<p>OCCAM:  College costs so much because Education, Inc. is hooked in with the Democrat Party.  When Democrats get in power, they make it as easy as possible to get college grants and student loans, low interest rates.  This gives Education, Inc. virtual permission to jack tuition rates sky high.  They pay back Democrats with campaign donations, stump speeches (a.k.a. college lectures to students), and so on.</p>

<p>In Kuwait and Saudi, this is the breakdown. Bangladeshi &amp; Pakis are all taxi drivers, Indians are all accountants/muslim shop managers, Philippino men and women are the slave labor and domestics. Need something done in a muslim bank?? wait until the Arab muslim goes downstairs to get his pet Indian, you got to the bank in the Banger&rsquo;s taxi, and the bank was cleaned by Philippinos.</p>

			<p> The entire public education industry pushes kids relentlessly to go to college.</p>
<p>This push is so the people can learn to read, write understand simple math, and even learn to speak correctly (after a fashion) because the public education system no longer bothers itself with such mundane matters.</p>

			<p>My greatest regret in life (to date) is that I thought that music performance was a good college major. I never finished, and still had to pay back the loans that my Dad took out. </p>
<p>It took a few years, but I got back into school; I&rsquo;m four classes from finishing, and I have a promising relationship now, too! Things aren&rsquo;t entirely grim in this world if I can find love!</p>

			<p>The best way out of this whole situation is to leave the country and go to Mexico.  Now you can come back across the border as an &#8220;illegal alien&#8221; in which case you now can get a free college education.  However you must be willing to throw some dirt on your face, drop 500 ponds of garbage at the border, show a valid criminal record, and be able to say &#8220;no comprehendo&#8221; to make it all look real.  Once you establish yourself as a valid &#8220;illegal alien&#8221; you now have more rights than an American citizen and Nancy Pelosi will make sure of that.               </p>
