			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Janet Fife-Yeomans, Daily Telegraph (Surry Hills, NSW), May 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THE leader of Sydney&rsquo;s radical Middle Eastern street gang  &mdash;  Asesinoz MC  &mdash;  yesterday accused Australians of racism.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old, who calls himself Sam &#8220;The Assassin&#8221;, defended the Parramatta-based gang&rsquo;s violent image in its YouTube videos and MySpace site.</p>
<p>They promote anti-Australian sentiment and flag burning.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a handful of good Australians but most are racist by assuming Lebanese people are responsible for all crimes,&#8221; he told The Daily Telegraph, speaking publicly for the first time.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they see a Middle Eastern walking down the street they assume they are Lebanese.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am half Lebanese and half Iraqi but I want the public and the police to know this: Don&rsquo;t forget about the Persians, Iraqis, Afghanis, Turks etc. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because they do crimes too. That is why we have posted these videos up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The president of one of the city&rsquo;s newest street gangs, he said he was known as Sam Asesinoz, which means assassin in Spanish, although it was not his real name.</p>
<p>On the gang&rsquo;s MySpace site, he warns: &#8220;Now we can&rsquo;t be f  &mdash;    &mdash;  - with, coz we will take your life, we are the true soldiers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He revealed yesterday that the Asesinoz MC had 70 members.</p>
<p>Senior police are concerned about the growth of gangs among young Middle Eastern men and have identified them, including Asesinoz MC and the Muslim Brotherhood Movement, as recruiting grounds for bikie gangs.</p>
<p>Mr &#8220;Asesinoz&#8221; said police, who have linked the gang to violence and vandalism, should be worried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to make a name for ourselves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The things we do (are) the reason why we are called a gang.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what we do keeps the Asesinoz reputation up and it lets everyone know that we are the last people that should be f  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   with.&#8221;<br>

			<p>So is this gang-banger going to leave racist, backward retrograde Australia for what must surely be first world non-racist non-discriminatory paradises like Lebanon and Iraq anytime soon/ever?</p>

			<p>Violence and graffiti are great ways to let people know that your race doesn&rsquo;t commit crime.</p>

			<p>Let me get this straight&hellip;.<br>
A foreign gang member called &#8220;the assassin&#8221; is complaining because he believes Australians are racist for thinking that foreigners commit crime? He is prrof that the Australians are right. This reminds me of a Amren story a few weeks ago where black diners in a fried chicken restaurant were complaining about the stereotype that blacks like fried chicken. </p>

			<p>As an Aussie myself, I think this thug has a self-defeating argument. His concern seems to be that people assume that he&rsquo;s Lebanese, rather than the assumption that those of Lebanese heritage commit crime. Flag-burning&hellip; it seems that he has no respect for our ways. I don&rsquo;t see Australians of Italian or Chinese descent running around burning the flag. But when riots broke out in Cronulla, there were Lebanese youths burning our flag. I&rsquo;m glad to say at least one of those has now become a patriotic Australian; it goes to show that given the correct guidance, people of any heritage can truly love their country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Australia never should have abandoned the White Australia policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that good things have come of it too. Prosperity, due to the rise of trade with Asian nations, which has kept us out of recession until recently. Understanding, and providing skills. Also new citizens of great calibre (Dr Victor Chang, heart surgery pioneer, and John So, fmr. Lord Mayor of Melbourne). Its just that incidents such as Cronulla show that we mustn&rsquo;t be led into thinking that all those who want to come to Australia will respect our ways and values. It means we should examine who we let in more carefully, so that we end up with more model citizens rather than a mass of racist thugs who target teenage girls because they were white (Mohammed Skaf? anyone?).</p>

<p>Sounds to me like there&rsquo;s little difference between these non-white immigrants and Australian leftists. Otherwise known as universities and the media and the politically correct. And now the government too.  </p>
<p>Seems to me the West is living under one giant &#8216;Stockholm Syndrome&rsquo;. The more they hate us, and act on it, the more we sympathize with them. Of course now it&rsquo;s pretty much made into law. </p>

			<p>AS usual, very strict immigration policies based on education &amp; and skills (none of the easy &#8220;refugee&#8221; or bring the extended family over nonsense that&rsquo;s been killing Britain) are the key to possible survival. But Aussies have to really get tough about protecting their own and ignore the trap of succumbing to the phony accusations of &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>

<p>At least as late as 1968, the Australians would not allow black soldiers off of the aircraft for R&R; from Viet-Nam, that is why I never got there. After those refusals, the military would not allow any of us to go there. I bet the White Australians in general are sorry that policy was changed.</p>

			<p>Anonymous at 7:45 AM, the problem with Dr Chang and John So, is that in order to get a couple good ones, you end up taking so many bad ones.  And the &#8220;good&#8221; ones will generally stick up for their racial brethren anyway.  How many good Americans of Chinese descent are opposed to Chinese immigration, for example?  Are we adequately compensated for the vast, lawless barrios that are spreading across the country, by the few Mexicans that  actually assimilate?   Whatever loss the West would suffer by deporting its 3rd world colonies would be much less than the gain.  </p>

			<p>Wonder why Australians, our allies in the Vietnam war, wouldn&rsquo;t let black soldiers take leave in Australia? That&rsquo;s quite an interesting chapter in the race relations story.</p>

<p>And don&rsquo;t forget how diversity and the influx of outsiders helped the Roman empire overcome it&rsquo;s nasty racism&hellip;</p>

<p>First of all the word in Spanish is &#8220;asesino&#8221; and means murderer. The language makes no distinction between the murder of an everyday person and of a famous person. <br>
Asesinoz sounds more like a side order accompanying Souflaki or Moussaka. </p>
<p>Year ago, a few years after we were married,  my wife and I investigated the possibility of migrating to Australia. Having both grown up in Philadelphia, we began to see the writing on the wall early on. The requirements for approval were very stringent; one of the things being that one have a skill that would be a positive contribution to Australian society. We both passed the test but because of our stong family ties, and some guilt tripping by our parents we decided to stay in the US.</p>
<p>What possible contribution to Australia have these people brought with them unless you count murder and rape?<br>
The Aussie have really lowered the bar.</p>
