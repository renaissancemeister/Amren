<h1><a href="https://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/05/jefferson_parish_black_teacher.html">Jefferson Parish Black Teachers&rsquo; Group Opposes White Gretna Principal</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jenny Hurwitz, Times-Picayune, May 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A coalition of Jefferson Parish&rsquo;s black educators has come out against the controversial decision to select Christine Templet, who is white [and the wife of state Rep. Ricky Templet, R-Gretna], as the new principal of Thomas Jefferson High School in Gretna, claiming the appointment excluded eligible African-American administrators who might be interested in the post.</p>
<p>In a Monday letter to Superintendent Diane Roussel, members of the Jefferson Alliance of Black School Educators argued that the district&rsquo;s current process for selecting principals could be construed as discriminatory, because it had precluded qualified, under-represented African-American candidates from applying for the position at the helm of the West Bank&rsquo;s only magnet high school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, district officials contend that Roussel has the sole discretion to make administrative appointments, a power granted by the district&rsquo;s desegregation order and affirmed by the School Board.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The desegregation order, which was approved by a federal judge last May, requires that principals be chosen by the superintendent in a manner consistent with board policy. Previously, the board required the superintendent to use committee input and a scoring rubric as part of the process to fill administrative vacancies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, members of JABSE noted that no black administrator has been appointed principal at any of the district&rsquo;s six academic magnets. They also questioned Roussel&rsquo;s decision to appoint a person with no school-based experience, as opposed to an African-American principal in the district &#8220;with proven academic success.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her former position as special programs coordinator under the district&rsquo;s special education department, Templet was responsible for overseeing special education services for students with disabilities in grades three to five. Prior to that, she worked as an educational consultant to the school system, reporting to the director of special education.</p>
<p>Board member Ray St. Pierre cited Roussel&rsquo;s decision to appoint Sharon Meggs-Hamilton as vice principal at Thomas Jefferson as proof that the superintendent is conscious of the demands of the desegregation order. Meggs-Hamilton, who is vice principal at Helen Cox High School in Harvey, is black.</p>
<p>Still, Holmes [Janine Holmes, union president,] emphasized the importance of placing more African-Americans in the top post, so it reflects school and parish demographics more accurately. While black candidates should also be considered for vice principal jobs, &#8220;the principal of the school is, of course, the leader, &#8221; she said.</p>

			<p>I have a mission for those of you in New Orleans.  Find me the article in the <i>New Orleans Times-Picayune</i> that described the opposition by whites to the ascension of a black to a position of power that didn&rsquo;t involve vitriol and contempt toward the whites.</p>

			<p>They can have their all Black schools in their all Black neighborhoods if why would let Whites have their own too.  Integration is a lie and this article more than proves it.</p>

			<p>We need much more of these honest and outspoken desires for separation. Blacks can actually be our allies in a certain respect and a buffer against liberal hate media. </p>

			<p>well i think i can speak from experience that the same thing happened here in metro atlanta, down in clayton county where they trumped up charges against the white school superintendent so they could run him off and make their school system all black.  of course the white man did not fight back, clayton schools got their black superintendent, then lost their accreditation, of course.  now, the system is in complete disaray, gang infested and the thousands of kids who go to school there a future in doubt.  nice goin&rsquo; clayton county</p>

			<p>I agree with Whiteplight. No one wants integration, white or black. But when whites demonstrate any desire to be among our own, we are called &#8216;racist&rsquo;. This needs to change, no matter what it takes.</p>

<i>&#8220;&hellip;opposed to an African-American principal in the district &ldquo;with proven academic success.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Are there any? Can anyone point to one black majority school district led by black principals that is an academic success?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any evidence that black administrators create academic success.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. One feature of blacks is that they are completely 100% immune to liberal conditioning. Liberal verbal hen pecking turns cerebral whites into self-doubting neurotics worried about every impure thought or action, but blacks don&rsquo;t internalize any of that political psychobabble. They are completely shameless in their racial preferences and personal behavior. </p>

			<p>danjack please do me a favor and define &#8220;racism&#8221; for us.  It seems you are merely arguing for intergration.  Fine if they don&rsquo;t want a white administrator it is their race and they should be able to make those choices.</p>

			<p>This isn&rsquo;t some odd abnormality or some kind of &#8216;reverse&rsquo; racism. This is how it goes in every single town, at every school, on every job, and I would assume, in every mind as well. Exactly how it goes - all locations. One might even say all around the world. Whites work to bring in as much &#8216;diversity&rsquo; as possible. People of color work to bring in, and keep things, as close as possible to the shade of whatever particular color they have. And whites are always the bad guys, and people of color the ones without original sin. </p>

			<p>Sounds ideal to me as long as the same rules apply to everybody.</p>
<p>Make sure EVERY school principal, coach, counselor, etc, etc&hellip;..&#8221;reflects school and parish demographics more accurately&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nothing would please me more than for ethnic minorities to ONLY have ethnic minorities for teachers, coaches and administrators&hellip;..PROVIDED the same rule applies to white students.</p>
<p>Excellent idea.<br>
