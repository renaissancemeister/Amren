			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Times (Lahore, Pakistan), May 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the 1980s when small towns in FATA were turning into recruitment centers for the Afghan war, seeds of jihad took hold and bloomed in some unexpected places  &mdash;  in two small towns in the United States, where two groups formed by Sheikh Mubarik Gilani  &mdash;  arrested in connection with Daniel Pearl&rsquo;s murder in 2002  &mdash;  are suspected of violent extremism.</p>
<p>The towns of Red House, Virginia and Islamberg, New York are home to a small number of African-American converts to Islam who have withdrawn from the outside world to live by a set of strict religious codes. The two communities, which have formed a sect calling themselves the Muslims of the Americas, are said to be the followers of Sheikh Gilani. Gilani began preaching at a mosque in Brooklyn, New York seeking recruits for the Afghan jihad in 1980. It was then that he formed the group Jamat al Fuqra and later the Muslims of the Americas.</p>
<p>The Muslims of the Americas, a group exempt from tax, operates communes of primarily black, American-born Muslims in many states in the US. In addition to the compounds in Virginia and New York, these groups, which some have characterized as a cult, has compounds in Badger, California; Red House, Virginia; Binghamton, New York; and York, South Carolina. The cult houses between 100 and 200 people, many of them women and children in about 20 huge trailers.</p>
<p>A 2005 Department of Homeland Security report, titled the &#8220;Integrated Planning Guidance Report&#8221;, warned that &#8220;other predicted possible sponsors of attacks (against North America) include Jamat al Fuqra (JF) that has been linked to Muslims of the Americas&#8221;.Federal government officials told Daily Times that in 2006, the Department of Justice reported that the JF &#8220;has more than 35 suspected communes and more than 30,000 members spread across the US, all in support of one goal: the purification of Islam through violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tiny town of Red House, with a conservative Christian population of 12,000, is located in rural Charlotte County, Virginia close to the North Carolina border. It is in this unlikely locale that Muslims of the Americas founded one of their compounds. A &#8220;No Trespassing&#8221; sign hangs at the entrance of the compound and discourages visitors. The group&rsquo;s most controversial contribution to the community has been to name a road outside their compound  &mdash;  Sheikh Gilani Lane. The road sign, which was put up in 2007, shattered the uneasy truce that had previously existed between the sect and the townsfolk. A local group, the Christian Action Network, demanded the removal of the sign and filed a complaint with the local county office. CAN&rsquo;s President Martin Mawyer told Daily Times that &#8220;Muslims of the Americas set up their compound in Red House in February of 1993 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no one knows the population of the camp since the people inside have isolated themselves&#8221;. The Christian Action Network&rsquo;s request was rejected.</p>
<p>Similarly, a secretive Muslim community calling itself Islamberg has settled in the woods of the western Catskills, 150 miles northwest of New York City. Like its counterpart in Red House, the compound displays a &#8220;No Trespassing&#8221; sign at its entrance. Reportedly, the compound was founded in 1980 by Sheikh Gilani, who purchased a 70-acre plot and invited followers to settle there. The compound has its own mosque, grocery store and schoolhouse. The FBI&rsquo;s Albany Division said the agency has an open dialogue with the residents of Islamberg. They&rsquo;ve visited the compound but would not discuss whether there are any ongoing investigations.</p>
<p>US officials in 1989, during a search of a storage locker in Colorado Springs, recovered a large cache of armaments and documents with multiple links to the JF. Among the arms recovered were handguns, semi-automatic firearms, explosives, pipe bombs, bomb components and several bombs. JF cadres are suspects in at least 10 unsolved assassinations and 17 firebombing cases between 1979 and 1990. The Red House commune was allegedly involved in a money laundering scheme.</p>
<p>That has not dispelled the worries of some watchdogs. Robert Spencer, director of Jihad Watch, says the Muslims of the Americas is making a concerted public relations effort to present a benign face and hide its violent past.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we need to be very much on guard about every member of these compounds,&#8221; he said. Though Spencer admits there is nothing inherently wrong with living in isolation, he stressed that &#8220;they&rsquo;re not at all open to visitors, they&rsquo;re not at all open to scrutiny and there&rsquo;s an abundance of evidence of sinister goings-on&#8221;.</p>
<p>Spencer offered no evidence to back his misgivings, but suggested political correctness may be hampering investigations. He says the group&rsquo;s connection to Sheikh Gilani is reason enough to be concerned. Spencer&rsquo;s suspicions that trouble is brewing in the compounds may be on point. Muslims of the Americas and Jamaat al Fuqra are both linked to a slew of terrorist acts and other criminal activity. In the 1980s, they carried out various terrorist acts, including numerous fire-bombings across the United States. JF&rsquo;s early targets in North America were Hindus and targets linked to various Jewish temples.<br>

						<p>Jamaat ul-Fuqra (alternatively Jamaat al-Fuqra) (Arabic: &#8220;Community of the Impoverished&#8221;) is a paramilitary organization of mostly African-American Muslims (not connected to the Nation of Islam) based in Pakistan and the United States. Some of the approximately 3000 members have planned various acts of violence, often directed at rival factions. Two Al-Fuqra members were convicted of conspiring to murder Rashad Khalifa in 1990, and others are alleged to have assassinated Ahmadiyya leader Mozaffar Ahmad in 1983.</p>
<p>al-Fuqra itself is not listed as a terror group by the US or the EU, but was listed as a terrorist organization in the 1999 <cite>Patterns of Global Terrorism</cite> report by the U.S. State Department. It operates two front groups: Muslims of the Americas and Quranic Open University. They also have been known to operate in Canada, and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Activities</p>
<p>Although various members have been suspected of assassinations and other acts of terror perpetrated in the 1980s and later, and some members having been charged with conspiracy to commit first degree murder and other crimes, al-Fuqra itself is not listed as a terror group by the US or the EU (it was listed as terrorist organization in the 1999 Patterns of Global Terrorism report by the U.S. State Department.)</p>
<p>News reports have attempted to connect &#8220;shoe bomber&#8221; Richard Reid and &#8220;Washington sniper&#8221; John Allen Muhammad to al-Fuqra, but the connections were not definitive. There are also allegations that Clement Rodney Hampton-El, one of the plotters who planned to blow up various New York City bridges and tunnels, was a member of Al Fuqra. The group has been banned in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Hotel Rajneesh bombing</p>
<p>The bombing of the Hotel Rajneesh can be definitively tied to an al-Fuqra member. On July 29, 1983, Stephen Paul Paster, an al-Fuqra member, set off a bomb at the Hotel Rajneesh, a hotel in Portland, Oregon. This hotel, located at SW 10th Avenue and Pine Street, was owned by the Rajneesh religious group and featured the Zorba the Buddha nightclub. Paster had several bombs and homemade napalm in his room, but one of the bombs went off in his hands while he was placing the bombs in the midst of the napalm.</p>

			<p>Hindsight is 20/20.  The United States of America and the United Kingdom spent decades railing and fulminating against Soviet communism.  It included organizing the Afghani resistance against the Soviet invasion in 1979, and through the 1980s.  And, as a humanitarian response, we had to let Afghani &#8220;refugees&#8221; settle in the U.S.  And look it where it got us   &mdash;   the mess we stirred up created AQ, OBL, Taliban, which of course bit us right back on 9/11.  And now these saintly &#8220;refugees&#8221; are recruiting American ex-convict blacks (IMHO) for whatever.</p>
<p>Similarly, our messing around in Indoamerica to beat back the Soviets led to MS-13 and Mara 18, which of course are now causing us problems.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union would have fallen anyway.  Even without secret (and not so secret) American help if Afghanistan, no white country has ever successfully occupied Afghanistan.</p>
<p>If I ever got a hold of serious political power, one of my fundamental precepts of foreign policy would be never to side actively with a non-white country, power or potentate against a white one, no matter how abhorrent I found the domestic and other policies of the other white country.</p>

			<p>Every society has it&rsquo;s subversives - whether it be the American Communist Party, the Bund, Louis Farakan&rsquo;s Black Muslims, the Puerto Rican Nationalists, etc..  And before the multi-culting of the US we could deal with it.  But now, with so many competing groups and potential (and probable) 5th columnists we are in for a very unpleasant ride.  With no place to hide.  Thanks to the goverment&rsquo;s refugee resettlement program of putting Muslims in white-majority states to dilute their populations this can only get worse.  The Muslims will preach hate against the US and weak-minded Americans, such as these folks (Muslims of the Americas), will join in.  The end is just a matter of time.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m saying again, Christians are NOT taking the muslim threat seriously enough&hellip;.nor is the U.S. government taking the threat of the black muslims in America seriously beyond a few agents. I believe the next serious attack in the U.S will be executed by these same blacks.</p>

			<p>&#8220;in 2006, the Department of Justice reported that the JF &ldquo;has more than 35 suspected communes and more than 30,000 members spread across the US, all in support of one goal: the purification of Islam through violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides these terrorists, there have been at least two jihadist training camps, reported by news sources, in the US who are actively training for terrorism.</p>
<p>And Janet Napolitano, with her SPLC advisors, has warned only of responsible conservative white citizens as terrorists to watch for in her memo to police agencies across the country.</p>
<p>This administration is still young, but it shows a far greater promise of being more extremely radical than Bill Clinton&rsquo;s or Jimmy Carter&rsquo;s leftist incompetents.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in for pure hell during this tenure.</p>

			<p>  Mohammed had nothing but contempt for Blacks.  In fact he called them &#8220;raisin heads!&#8221;  Considering this and the Arab Muslim slave trade, why any Blacks in American would wish to convert to Islam is astonishing!</p>

			<p>The truth is Islam has nothing but contempt for blacks.</p>
<p>Totally true. Caucasian Saudi and Kuwaiti muslims think blacks are good only for labor, slavery and fodder in war. Blacks are worth less than a woman and a woman is worth less than a donkey to them. I don&rsquo;t get the black attraction to the muslim ideaology either, except that it may be their cause/justification for some of the atrocities they intend to commit on the White, non muslim race.</p>

			<p>Some poster asked, why does Islam appeal to blacks?</p>
<p>Because, Islam appeals to every social pathology, every racial mythology and every deep, dark internalized demon present in the black American psyche.  That&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Islam tells blacks what they want to hear.  Islam tells blacks most all the same things that the Marxists tell them, but more persuasively, because blacks are intrinsically religious.  Blacks don&rsquo;t generally buy the Leftist philosophy on religion.</p>
<p>So, Islam tells them the West is bad.  The white man is going to be overthrown.  Islam talks about equality.  Islam talks about revolution.  About making things right and fair (for them).  Islam offers the veneer of intellectualism and discipline through mindless conformity to simple rules and dogma.  Marry lots of women if you want.  Make lots of babies.  But when it&rsquo;s time to go wild and get revenge, Islam says Okay.  Islam tells them they are superior to infidels.  Superior to whites.  Islam promises they are going to take over and make slaves of the white man.  America will become the African&rsquo;s caliphate in the House of Islam.</p>
<p>In the future, blacks will convert to Islam in large numbers.</p>
<p>Why?  Because of the change in racial demographics and because of the failure of the welfare state, coupled with the advance of Islam in America as it is advancing in Europe.  Because black Christianity and black Islam are actually merging&hellip; synthesizing into one proto-religion.  Slowly, but it&rsquo;s happening.  Have you ever wondered what is being preached in black churches every Sunday?  You might be surprised.  Reverend Wright is NO EXCEPTION.  He&rsquo;s the RULE.  He embraces Reverend Farrakhan as a brother.  Black Christianity and Black Islam in America are not in a rivalry!  They are merging!</p>
<p>Within about 50 years, the black population will begin to overtake the white.  Once blacks have the strength of numbers to elect their own candidates, they will dump the Democrats.  Smart secular politicians will see this opportunity, and so will smart religious ones. They will compete to take advantage of the rise of ethnopolitics and capture the black masses.  They will do whatever they are told to do.  Believe anything.</p>
<p>There will be the formation of a black Muslim party in the future, mark my words.  And they will pick up where the Democrats left off with the promises.  Lots of justice for the oppressed, lots of vengeful retaliation against the wicked.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my take.  Think happy thoughts!  </p>
