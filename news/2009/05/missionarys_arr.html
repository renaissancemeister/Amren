<h1>Missionary&rsquo;s Arrest Sparks Discussion, Fear</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sheena Mcfarland, Salt Lake Tribune, April 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The arrest of an undocumented immigrant returning last week from his LDS mission has sparked discussion at the highest levels of the church about how to limit such exposure in the future.</p>
<p>../../../../__8220.css;With the known realization that those risks exist, then we want to do better, or at least learn more,&#8221; LDS apostle Jeffrey R. Holland, said Friday during an interview with The Salt Lake Tribune . ../../../../__8220.css;We want to be more precise, if we can, about how to help, how to make [a mission] the calmest, most spiritually rewarding experience for everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Early last week, a missionary was detained at the Cincinnati airport for ../../../../__8220.css;lacking necessary documentation to board his flight home,&#8221; according to Michael Purdy, LDS Church spokesman.</p>
<p>That triggered fears in the undocumented LDS community in Utah, and already prompted a change in how one Utah missionary returned home. The young man, a Salt Lake Valley resident, completed a mission in Oklahoma and was scheduled to return home two days after church leaders heard of the unrelated arrest in Ohio. The mission president contacted local Utah church leaders, and it was decided the missionary&rsquo;s uncle would drive out to Oklahoma to bring the missionary home, which he did.</p>
<p>../../../../__8220.css;The travel department of the church has to rethink everything. Things have changed, and they need a whole new policy,&#8221; said a local church official who was aware of the situation. ../../../../__8220.css;With ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] hitting them at the bus terminals and airports, this opens a whole new discussion. I don&rsquo;t know how many undocumented immigrants we have serving missions, but I&rsquo;m sure this is going to repeat itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>LDS Church leaders have had evolving policies on how to keep undocumented missionaries safe. But this is the first time Holland has heard of a missionary being arrested by immigration officials while serving.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The LDS Church has changed its policies about mission calls for undocumented immigrants over time. Previously, they had to return to their country of origin for extended periods of time and then could serve. However, U.S. Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, inserted language into a 2005 agricultural bill that absolves religious organizations of criminal liability for allowing their undocumented members to perform volunteer service, including mission work.</p>
<p>Church leaders do make certain accommodations for undocumented missionaries, including calling them only to missions within the United States. But leaders acknowledge the missionaries&rsquo; potential legal jeopardy.</p>
<p>../../../../__8220.css;They go knowing themselves that they&rsquo;re at risk, and nothing in our mission call changes that,&#8221; Holland said. ../../../../__8220.css;They know that, and we know that, and we work within those parameters to have them be constructive, honorable, faithful, spiritual, religious emissaries for that period of service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sending undocumented immigrants on a mission, though, sends a mixed message, with the potential for ../../../../__8220.css;tragic&#8221; results for missionaries and their families, said Ron Mortensen of the Utah Coalition on Illegal Immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Holland says LDS leaders will continue to have discussions about making sure undocumented missionaries get home safely.</p>
<p>../../../../__8220.css;Clearly we do take and always will take a great sense of responsibility for the safety of our missionaries in any part of the world.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Amazing! And so what laws should we obey? And &#8216;undocumented&rsquo;. Is that the same as &#8216;entered the country illegally&rsquo;?.</p>
<p>Perhaps the LDS church can lecture me on how to slip by on other laws I find inconvenient.</p>

			<p>More religious groups and churches aiding and abetting the illegal aliens. Hey, why don&rsquo;t they send these illegal missionaries to MEXICO where they belong? Or is the Mormon Church pandering and wanting more Hispanics to join their Church? They see the writing on the wall and the demographic change in America and they want their piece of the pie. Seems they are selling out the real Mormons and the demographic that started the Mormon movement&hellip;They will soon realize that ../../../../__8220.css;diversity&#8221; is the last thing they need or should even want.</p>

			<p>Senator Bennet&rsquo;s father Wallace( also a senator )was a patriot. The son seems to be a go along neocon.</p>

			<p>How can the Salt Lake Tribune describe this person as a resident of Salt Lake Valley if he is not a resident? I would expect a lib repoetee to talk like that. I am surprised, however, that the LDS church would facilitate an illegal alien and at the same time preach about honoring and sustaining the law.  </p>

			<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have a book name  The Articles of Faith, it say # 12.&#8221;We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.&#8221;                     CONFLICT in INTERESTING ????</p>

			<p>These people not not true Americans.  True Americans obey the laws and expect others to do the same.</p>

			<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have always viewed themselves as somewhat seperate from the rest of the United States.  The Mormons still resent the fact that the federal government arm-twisted them to end polygamy in Utah, however, they do not really enforce the law against it in that state either.</p>
<p>The same thing applies with Hispanic illegal immigrants who the Mormons believe are part of a (non-existent) Hebrew tribe, the ../../../../__8220.css;Lamanites&#8221; who must be redeemed.  So Utah has become one of the most welcoming states for illegal immigrants in the nation.</p>

			<p>The Mormons should have listened to Joseph Smith and Moroni and kept their flock ../../../../__8220.css;white and delightsome.&#8221; The whole notion about the dark skinned, low and evil natured Lamanites destroying civilization is good advice. The idea is basically Camp of the Saints told as a Biblical story. </p>

			<p>I think many people are missing the larger point here.  The LDS church in Salt Lake City has been throwing out ../../../../__8220.css;eternal&#8221; revelations in order to be trendy.  Utah is also now full of third world crime and problems as the LDS import ../../../../__8220.css;diversity&#8221; to their once crime free state.  The present church leaders just don&rsquo;t understand why Joseph Smith set things up the way he did, and they would arrest him if he showed up in Salt Lake City today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not kidding about them arresting him. They would.  What does that tell you about the church these days? </p>

Let&rsquo;s remember that the Mormons, in migrating to Utah, thought they were leaving the USA behind and moving to Mexico  (which it then was).   Next thing, the Mexican war happened and they found themselves right back in the bad ole USA again!   It wasn&rsquo;t what they had intended.  They didn&rsquo;t want to be in the USA.</p>
<p>There is an old army fort in Salt Lake city, a relic of pioneer times.  Most (indeed all) other forts in the West existed to protect settlers from marauders and Indians.  However, THIS fort, uniquely, as the guides point out, is the ONLY one whose guns point INWARD at the city, instead of outward at attackers.   The US government didn&rsquo;t trust the Mormons even then.</p>
