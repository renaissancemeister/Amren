<h1>Obama Taps Bolden to Lead NASA</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>K.C. Jones, InformationWeek, May 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bolden retired from the U.S. Marine Corps in 2003 as commanding general of the Third Marine Aircraft Wing. He served for more than 34 years in the Marine Corps before becoming senior VP at TechTrans International through 2005. He is currently CEO of the privately held military and aerospace consulting firm JackandPanther.</p>
<p>Since joining the Marines in 1968, Bolden flew more than 100 sorties and served in Vietnam from 1972 to 1973. Years later, he embarked on two space shuttle missions as pilot and two as commander, NASA said. He was tapped to lead the safety division at the Johnson Space Center after the Challenger disaster in 1986. Six years later, he became assistant deputy administrator of NASA headquarters in 1992. Bolden has a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering from the U.S. Naval Academy and a master of science in systems management from the University of Southern California.</p>

		<p>Stuff like this is making me more and more racist by the day.  It is not that I don&rsquo;t like nonwhites as individuals.  If there were just a few in this country I wouldn&rsquo;t mind.  But it is getting to the point where not only do we have to see them everywhere out in public taking over our schools and movie theaters etc&hellip;, but we also have to see them on TV every day &#8220;leading&#8221; our once great country.</p>
<p>Any white person who lectures me ever again on how &#8220;it is so nice that we have gotten past race in this country&#8221; is going to receive a harsh rebuttal from me.  How are white people STILL so stupid about this stuff?  If there were just a few nonwhites here and there, I could understand the naivety of a lot of whites on this topic, but for goodness sake&hellip;..we are getting swamped by these people!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ever want to hear another sheepish white lecture me on how &#8220;I am not a racist BUT&hellip;.I don&rsquo;t like Obama&hellip;&#8221;.  I am SICK of it!</p>

		<p>The race to turn everything black has warped into light speed.</p>
<p>Then again, space is a black vacuum after all so it&rsquo;s somewhat apropo.</p>
<p>The black man on the street does nothing but moan about how the space program is a waste of money that should be used for better things like giving the money to them.</p>
<p>The only hope I have is that at some point in the future, the novelty of appointing blacks will wear off. After this runs its course, all the positions of &#8216;the first black man to be _______&#8221; will have been exhausted and merit might re-emerge as the main criteria for naming qualified white men to such positions.</p>
<p>And I have to wonder how many black guys this black guy will find to fill positions. Just how many blacks have the degrees that are needed to hold most positions at NASA? Really, they can&rsquo;t get enough qualified blacks to graduate medical school. How many blacks are certified aerospace engineers?<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s incredible the way most successful Blacks have White ancestry, yet they&rsquo;re displayed as &#8220;Blacks&#8221; by the media and also consider themselves &#8220;Black&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s very apparent that this man has some White facial features to go along with his brown skin.  There is definite White ancestry there.</p>
<p>The tragic thing is that the media portrays mulatto Blacks like Obama, this guy, and many others as being &#8220;typical&#8221; when they are in no way, shape or form &#8220;typical&#8221; of their race.  Their success is predicated on their White genes and no other reason.  </p>

		<p>Bolden is a good and competent man.  I&rsquo;ll bet not one in a thousand blacks could tell you who he is.  Every non-dysfunctional ethnic group would be proud of General Bolden and hold him up as a role model.  </p>
<p>The real issue, however, is that NASA is just one more government boondoggle.  Manned space exploration is ridiculous.  The only use for space is for communication satellites, and private industry can launch those using small solid fuel boosters.  </p>

<p>Well, at least this fellow isn&rsquo;t making idiotic statements (yet?) about how blacks will bring a new understanding about space travel, as General Secretary BO&rsquo;s Supreme Court nominee has done regarding the law. Moreover, he does seem to have the qualifications for the job (at least on paper,) so I say cut him a bit of slack. </p>
<p>However, General Secretary BO does disappoint here for other reasons. Why didn&rsquo;t he (our transcendental, post-racial, General Secretary) have contact with some space aliens and appoint one of them to lead NASA? Was this beyond his abilities? </p>
<p>After all, most space aliens are described as &ldquo;Grays,&rdquo; and one would think that such a evenly diffuse pigmentation and more advanced technical insights might serve NASA well?</p>
<p>Even if the term &ldquo;space alien&rdquo; does have a negative connotation, they could always refer to him as an intergalactic migrant, couldn&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>I am very sad and disillusioned now!</p>

		<p>General Bolden is in the talented tenth for sure (more likely the top 1%). His dad was a respected football coach at CA Johnson and the neighborhood east of this high school is not a bad looking area (Barhamville Road). I think he grew up somewhere around this general area. However, one of the worst housing projects in Columbia, SC (Saxon Homes) is just down the hill less than a 1/2 mile away. He got into the Naval Academy before Affirmative Action started rolling and made it to a 3 star general. Beyond a certain point, the military along with high dollar law firms and wall street, are not going to tolerate &#8220;affirmative action success stories&#8221;. If left alone, General Bolden can do the job. The problem he is going to have is that Obama is going to lean on him endlessly to promote &#8220;diversity&#8221;. I shudder to think how many accidents will be caused by an incompetent work force he have to hire.  </p>

		<p>When positions are filled to fit some racial quota, spoken or unspoken, rather than based on excellence, our competitiveness as a nation drastically suffers. This is extremely serious in an increasingly competitive world, as we are all seeing now. This is so in line with logic and common sense that the GOP could have had this issue sewn up years ago if they had done their job, but of course they refused to. Even worse, the general public, the rank and file of the voters, let them get away with it when they still had a chance to do something about it. That&rsquo;s the strangest and saddest thing of all.</p>

		<p>Courtney: this guy, who seems amply qualified for the job, probably has American ancestry stretching back a lot further than you, or indeed most whites. If it was an immigrant just stepped off the boat you may have a point. But this is different.</p>

		<p>The goal of the racists is to completely replace white males with non-whites and white females.  We are to be eliminated so the &#8220;superior&#8221; non-whites can replace us.  Since all white males are responsible for all evil in the world they think that all evil will disappear when white males disappear.  They are quite serious.  They are completely insane and totally evil.  Some of you may find this observation to be extreme but I was raised by radical leftist activists and I assure you this is exactly what they think.  They don&rsquo;t regard white males as human.  The lives of white males mean nothing to them.  </p>

		<p>This is just another manifestation of the U.S. collapse to 3rd world status, just like South Africa, Zimbabwe, France and the U.K.</p>
<p>This nation cannot duplicate the feats it accomplished 40 years ago, let alone even dream of exceeding them. After this year there will be no more manned missions into LEO, the Saturn 5 has proven impossible to backward engineer from the last example of same stored in Alabama, nuclear energy will never be adapted to future launch vehicles thanks to marxist greens.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter who is in charge of NASA, the organization was created to prevent the conquest of space, and make a fortune for aerospace companies in stolen tax money for the most inefficient, wasteful and unnecessarily expensive missions to nowhere. </p>

<p>That aside, would a white man whose biography matched Bolden&rsquo;s point by point have had a chance of receiving such an appointment? Are there any white men within NASA who are equally or more qualified? </p>

<p>More than this, during the &rsquo;60s moon race, led by Whites and manned by Whites (males), Blacks were in the streets with their leadership, calling for the defeat of America on all fronts; &#8220;Burn Baby, Burn&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>My father was right, it was largely communist, but specically American communist (as opposed to Soviet) that preyed upon the young idealistic minds of the era to the ruin of all.  (Mine too, it was a very confusing time to grow up in).</p>

<p>Actually my ancestors have been here since the American Revolution and they have done more to shape this nation than this black man&rsquo;s ancestors have.  My point here, is don&rsquo;t judge a particular poster unless you have all your facts straight ahead of time.</p>
<p>And I am getting fed up at the big picture here.  I am not really directing my anger at the fact that this one minority is filling this particular position.  I am fed up because this is representative of what is happening all around us in this nation: it is getting taken away from white people.  </p>
<p>White males inparticular are the only group who can be given a whopping majority of the credit for making this country a great place, but yet they are discriminated against and shoved aside today.  I say ENOUGH!</p>
<p>By looking at your last name I see that you are Chinese.  China is in no danger of dissappearing or losing it&rsquo;s culture to that of immigrants and invaders.  Again, as I say above, you have no business judging me.</p>

		<p>Mr. Bolden was a marine pilot who flew a number of combat missions, flew two missions as an astronaut, and attained the rank of general.  He began his career in the marines in the late 60s.  The Marines are known as the least PC of the services, and they would certainly have been still less so back then.  I have no reason to doubt that Mr. Bolden is qualified for the job, or that a white man with equivalent qualifications would also have been selected.  In fact there is a white man with equivalent qualifcations who was named NASA administrator - Richard Truly, an admiral and former astronaut, who headed NASA from 1989-1992.</p>
<p>There are plenty of egregious examples of people being promoted beyond their ability through affirmative action.  But I don&rsquo;t think this is one of them.  I wish Mr. Bolden the best of luck in his new job.</p>

<p>The point was made, regardless of your own actual personal circumstances. The point remains valid for perhaps a majority of white Americans.  </p>
<p><i>White males inparticular are the only group who can be given a whopping majority of the credit for making this country a great place, but yet they are discriminated against and shoved aside today.<i></i></i></p>
<p>Maybe because they formed a historic majority of the people on this continent themselves. Also helping themselves to a few things that were not their own to begin with also made things perhaps a bit easier. </p>
<p>But now other people have come in I&rsquo;d say that Asian males are making a contribution that probably exceeds that of white males on a basis proportional to their actual numbers in the population.</p>

<p>So your comment just does not make sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ever astounding insights of Comrade Liu, are right up there with the wisdom of Archie comic books!</p>
<p>He makes much ado  about the historic &ldquo;transgressions&rdquo; of whites, when he ignorantly notes that those whites were: &ldquo;helping themselves to a few things that were not their own to begin with,&rdquo; and that this &ldquo;also made things perhaps a bit easier&rdquo; for them to build a civilization based on the original European copy. He then makes the above remarks, in his blind Red Asian arrogance, that his kind are coming here and  &ldquo;making a contribution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It never dawns on him, that these &ldquo;contributions&rdquo; are being made (if they even really exist?) at not only the expense of whites and what they built on the continent, but also the Native Americans who are still here. That is to say nothing of their ancestors who battled whites from the beginning, before they were defeated and North America became part of the West.  </p>
<p>In short, his is the logic of two wrongs making a right, and a few Wongs added to it being better than white, when considering the Native Americans&rsquo; plight!</p>
<p>Nice &ldquo;contribution&rdquo; Comrade Liu!!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;The point was made, regardless of your own actual personal circumstances. The point remains valid for perhaps a majority of white Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your original point was to attack me individually.  It didn&rsquo;t work, so now you are trying to change the topic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe because they formed a historic majority of the people on this continent themselves. Also helping themselves to a few things that were not their own to begin with also made things perhaps a bit easier. &#8220;</p>
<p>What is this supposed to mean?  What were white men helping themselves to?  Were the American Indians supplying them with the instructions on how to build airplanes?  Were the American Indians giving them blueprints on how to get to the moon?  </p>
<p>Please explain to me what it is that the white man was taking that &#8220;made it easier&#8221; as you say, to build this nation.  Would the arabs or the Polynesians been able to come over here and make a country as great under the same circumstances?  Or were these white men perhaps bringing over their great culture from Europe (which you don&rsquo;t want to admit to) and recreating it here?</p>
<p>&#8220;But now other people have come in I&rsquo;d say that Asian males are making a contribution that probably exceeds that of white males on a basis proportional to their actual numbers in the population.&#8221;</p>
<p>So you attack the white man for coming over here and building this great society but yet you want to live here and reap the benefits of it as an Asian man?  Just see what this continent would have been like had the white man not come over and create America.  I would like to see just how well the Chinese would do with those &#8220;resources&#8221; had they come over here before the white man came and improved things.</p>

<p>That is a moot point. Chinese would probably have done quite well - but left the indigenous relatively unscathed.</p>
<p>Whites took a whole lot of wealth and land from non-whites, and made themselves and produced something from it. But saying that non-whites do not have a share in what was produced from stuff that was theirs in the first place, is like saying the building supplier, the concrete supplier, does not need to be paid if you build a mansion. Sorry but if you build a mansion from building products unpaid for, then the trade creditors have a right to part of that mansion.<br>

<p>That is funny considering that the Chinese are among the most racist people on the planet.  You should be thankful that whites are as tolerant of other races as they are; otherwise people like you or other Chinese people wouldn&rsquo;t be able to live here. </p>
<p>So you think the Chinese are just perfect people with no faults whatsoever?  That is impossible.  No human beings are perfect, and it is not as if I ever said the whites are perfect.  How arrogant for you to say what you said.  I don&rsquo;t see too many people of any race having an interest to immigrate to China so that speaks volumes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whites took a whole lot of wealth and land from non-whites, and made themselves and produced something from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And how come nobody stopped them from doing it?  You know, whites have done a whole lot of good for the world also.  And you still haven&rsquo;t explained why you are living in America or why Chinese even have a place in America when they are living off of the benefits of what the white man &#8220;stole&#8221; from someone else.</p>
<p>&#8220;But saying that non-whites do not have a share in what was produced from stuff that was theirs in the first place, is like saying the building supplier, the concrete supplier, does not need to be paid if you build a mansion. Sorry but if you build a mansion from building products unpaid for, then the trade creditors have a right to part of that mansion.&#8221;</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t be having this conversation if you hadn&rsquo;t taken my original point out of context.  All I said was that this guy getting appointed to lead NASA is representative of what is happening to this country as a whole.  We are getting taken over by Third World people. </p>
<p>I never said that the blacks who we brought over or the Native Americans who were already here should NOT have a piece of the pie, even if they are qualified, now did I????  The only reason I am pin pointing this particular man here is because he represents what is happening to the country overall.  Most of my anger is directed at the people who don&rsquo;t belong here, as opposed to people like him (Mexicans, Asians etc&hellip;).  </p>
<p>Please explain to me (for the thousandth time) how Chinese, Indians and Mexicans who have come here as immigrants have anything in common with the blacks who were brought over by the white man or the Native Americans who were already here.  You haven&rsquo;t really explained to me how Chinese people and Mexicans etc&hellip;. have any business being here.  Our country did just fine without you. Stop trying to lump yourself in with the descendants of black slaves and Native Americans who couldn&rsquo;t help being here.<br>

		<p><i>And how can you prove this, or is that bit of nonsense simply your &ldquo;considered&rdquo; opinion?</i></p>
<p>Based on the historical record thus far. Chinese went to Africa before the Europeans with a massive fleet of ships more magnificent than Europe had at the time. But we traded <i>with</i> Africans, not <i>in</i> Africans. Tibetans and Uighurs are the majority of their respective places, as is the case with Mongolians and other minorities - in fact bilingualism is compulsory in these areas - if not always perfectly enforced. Contrast this to those places which suffered European invasion - the native peoples basically disappeared or their mixed descendants form about one or two percent of the population.</p>
<p>Of course we cannot really know what would have happened if China had colonized American before Europeans. But given the relatively tolerant strain in Chinese culture, the likelihood is Native Americans would have been better off under Chinese rule than European rule.</p>
<p>But speculating on this is really a waste of time. Whites did the crime, for whatever reason, so let&rsquo;s focus on them.</p>
<p><i>Moreover, the whites coming onto the continent, learned this by way of that violence and savagery being turned loose on their women and children, when they were not killing themselves.</i></p>
<p>Of course it is morally wrong to kill women and children, but these things are expected given the fact that Europeans were the aggressors. When one&rsquo;s land is invaded, the defenders will perhaps fight with more savagery than otherwise - the atrocities meted out to European interlopers by the American Indians were I would guess not much worse than what Boadicea&rsquo;s followers inflicted on &#8216;innocent&rsquo; Roman civilians in Britain.<br>

<p><i>Are you saying that Chinese males are so cowardly that they would not fight for their women and children, if they were butchered Native Americans?</i></p>
<p>So you are saying that the extermination of the Native Americans was really only retaliation for Indian atrocities? About as believably as Barbarossa simply being a preemptive strike against the Soviet Union, to block an imminent invasion. Just completely absurd.</p>

<p>Whether the case or not, irrelevant. Europeans also spent a lot of time doing nasty things to each other. But would you accept that as justification for China to take over the whole of Europe and reduce Europeans to 2 percent of the population?</p>

<p><i>that no Asian country could build ships that could make it to another continent, while our ancestors were sailing on all seas of both hemispheres</i></p>
<p>Chinese built very good ships - better than European ones of the time. We just had stupid, backward thinking rulers.</p>
<p>Some European observers commented on Chinese maritime technology&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;They make ships larger than ours, about 2,000 tons in size, with five sails and as many masts. The lower part is made of three decks, so as to better resist storms, which occur frequently. These ships are separated into <b>several compartments</b>, so that if one is touched during a storm, the others remain intact.&#8221;</i>  &mdash; Niccolò da Conti <br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/ntk7k9" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/ntk7k9</a></p>
<p>The compartmentalization was a Chinese innovation.</p>
<p>As for Zheng Hes Armada:<br>
<i>&#8220;Of the well over 200 ships in each armada, more than sixty were 385–440 feet long. The number of Ming ships, which Professor Dreyer considers to have been huge shallow-draught river barges, overshadows the Spanish Armada; in size, they dwarfed British ships-of-the-line such as Nelson&rsquo;s Victory.&#8221;</i></p>

I use John for the convenience of people here. Besides, for Westerners, it is easier to remember John Li than Liu Bocheng.</p>
<p>Must admit my Mandarin is scratchy - I&rsquo;m Southern Chinese origin, brought up in Hong Kong - so my Mandarin is not as good as if I had been raised inside China (in China everyone learns Mandarin). </p>

		<p>Comrade Liu notes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Based on the historical record thus far. Chinese went to Africa before the Europeans with a massive fleet of ships more magnificent than Europe had at the time. But we traded with Africans, not in Africans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While I am not an expert in Chinese history, I do know that the period you are speaking of was not a sustained effort by China at trade with Africa. That Chinese fleet (the Zheng He expeditions of 1402 to 1430) was substantially reduced by Emperor Zhu Di roughly in the year 1421, and following his death in 1424, it was recalled back fully in the 1430s by subsequent Ming Emperors, who then had the country enter a phase of isolation and ended such trade/exploration.    </p>
<p>Thus, the example of Chinese trade with Africans, and not &ldquo;in&rdquo; Africans is at best a poor one. If China had been trading with Africa for centuries and that trade had historically involved slavery (cutting both ways mind you, with North Africans raiding China and destroying entire costal cities and kidnapping the populations, or victorious African tribes selling their conquered captives to China as slaves) things might be a bit different, to say the least. As I have observed in the past, you do tend to forget that Europe had a much different history with Africa than did China; of course you would, since historical accuracy isn&rsquo;t your goal here, only demonizing whites. As you prove with this beyond stupid sentence: &ldquo;But speculating on this is really a waste of time. Whites did the crime, for whatever reason, so let&rsquo;s focus on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After all, who started that speculating in the first place Comrade Liu and infused China into it? </p>
<p>Also, I wonder if the Vietnamese would share your rather idealized view of  the &ldquo;relatively tolerant strain in Chinese culture,&rdquo; both in distant and recent history? There is evidence that they would not, for example this Time Magazine article from April 16, 2009:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1891668,00.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1891668,00.html</a></p>

<p>No what is absurd, is your unbelievably slanted grasp of history. You will ignore any point of past nonwhite atrocity against whites, simply to justify a continuation of such in the present. For example, the original Roanoke Colony&rsquo;s &ldquo;disappearance,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; natives likely responsible for it here in North America. After all, weren&rsquo;t those English settlers living peacefully next to their Indian &ldquo;brethren?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Moreover, the comparison of the United States&rsquo; Indian Wars to Barbarossa, is even more asinine. However, I do wonder what China would look like today (or even if there would be any China left,) if  it was only those American Indians aiding your country and not the Americans of the USA from the 1930s through the 1940s, had they succeeded in defeating the Europeans early on? </p>
<p>Now there is an interesting speculation to be sure, particularly from the Japanese perspective Comrade!<br>

<p>I am not going to waste my time arguing with you anymore.  Your argument has been hypocritical from the start.  You say that Chinese people should be able to live in Western nations but you don&rsquo;t admit that Western nations are perhaps better places to live than China.  You just focus on all the evil of whites but yet you don&rsquo;t acknowledge that perhaps whites can&rsquo;t be all that bad if you insist that Chinese people must live in white countries instead of China itself.  I just don&rsquo;t have much respect for your line of reasoning.</p>
