<h1>Labor Secretary Says Making Sure Undocumented Workers Get Paid Will Be Priority</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Victor Epstein, AP, April 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ensuring undocumented workers get paid and improving worker safety are two priorities for the Department of Labor, its first Hispanic secretary said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hilda Solis visited a green jobs event in northern New Jersey, where she said unpaid wages will continue to be a problem for day laborers until comprehensive immigration reform is undertaken at the federal level. But she cautioned that stabilizing the economy and health care reform must come first for President Barack Obama&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p>Day laborers, many of them Hispanic, are sometimes denied payment and are afraid to press for wages when they&rsquo;re in the country illegally. Solis, who took office Feb. 24, said she takes this &#8220;very seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re going to have people going out in the field and investigating,&#8221; Solis said, noting that she differs from her predecessor, Elaine Chao, in this approach. &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to be more robust in this area and also with respect to OSHA.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration is responsible for enforcing workplace safety and health regulations. It&rsquo;s part of the Department of Labor.</p>
<p>Solis spoke privately with a group of local Hispanic leaders, including Perth Amboy Mayor Wilda Diaz, about workplace safety before the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of Latinos in the work force, we&rsquo;re probably the ones that are faced with the most fatalities and injuries,&#8221; Solis told them, citing the many Hispanics in the construction industry.</p>
<p>Solis said the national discussion of comprehensive immigration reform will begin this summer. She said goals include eliminating the underground economy that has sprouted up around illegal workers and preventing the separation of families that include children who are U.S. citizens and others who have not been granted legal entry.</p>

			<p>I keep hearing illegal aliens and their advocates complain about how they&rsquo;re being exploited.  Hey genius, that&rsquo;s why you were brought here, to be exploited.  Because you&rsquo;re exploitable.  If you weren&rsquo;t, then our aristocrats wouldn&rsquo;t have had open borders to let you sneak in.</p>

That would be because they don&rsquo;t follow safety precautions and are largely incompetent.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s what I saw an illegal immigrant doing, probably at the direction of his employer.  His employer is probably an asian or white visa over stayer immigrant contractor.  The contractor&rsquo;s license was probably fraudlently obtained by paying someone else to take the contractor&rsquo;s exam.</p>
<p>The 4&rsquo;ft 8 illegal rain forest tribesman had an 8ft by 4ft piece of glass set up in the street between 2 parked cars.  The 8ft by 4ft piece of glass was held up by just 2 saw horses.  A piece of anything, let alone window glass that size needs 4 saw horses.</p>
<p>The illegal tribesman was all alone.  No one was there to hld the piece of glass he was cutting.  He had an electric glass cutter.  He had no gloves, goggles nor proper work boots as mandated by law when cutting glass.</p>
<p>He was just cutting away at this 8ft piece of glass.  Who was going to keep the whote thing from falling and splintering when he finally sawed through I have no idea.  I&rsquo;m sure his asian, persian, armenian, or russian boss had no idea either.</p>
<p>People wonder why California houses start falling apart 5 years after they are built.</p>

			<p>Obama and all of his Democratic appointees are big fans of illegal immigration.  It would have been nice if McCain wasn&rsquo;t in the same camp, but he is.  The powers that be made damn sure we wouldn&rsquo;t have a choice on this issue.<br>

			<p>Making sure illegals get paid, and follow safety regulations is only fair to them. It will make it less attractive to hire them. I&rsquo;m all for it. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m all for Labor making sure illegals are paid fair wages and have safe working conditions!  That will take away some of the reason that unscrupulous employers hire them.  And Labor has a much better track record of enforcing Fair Wage &amp; OSHA rules than ICE has of enforcing immigration rules.</p>

			<p>When you flush the toilet, just think of what is happening to the once great United States.</p>
<p>Democracy is dead in the United States.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as representative government.</p>
<p>One day in the not too distant future, the United States will resemble Detroit everywhere.</p>
