<h1>Md. Creates Commission to Help African Immigrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, May 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gov. Martin O&rsquo;Malley has created a new commission to help business and community development interests of African immigrants who have come to Maryland.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Malley signed an executive order creating the African Affairs Commission on Thursday. The governor also swore in 21 members of the commission.</p>
<p>One of the commission&rsquo;s main goals will be to expand state government outreach efforts to help Maryland citizens who have immigrated from African nations. The state also has commissions that oversee efforts to help Asian, Hispanic and Middle Eastern immigrants.</p>
<p>Valentina Ukwuoma, who heads the Bureau of Solid Waste for the Baltimore City Department of Public Works, has been appointed to chair the commission.<br>

			<p>When the U.S. was controled by people who had American citizens best interests at heart, there were no commisions to help this, that or the other &#8220;immigrant&#8221;. The &#8220;immigrant&#8221; was privileged in being allowed to come to this nation. The rest was up to them. They needed a sponsor and a job lined up. They needed to prove, unlike today, that they would not be a burden to the U.S. taxpayer. The reason we have the policies we do today, is obviously because those who have influence, do not care about the American taxpayer  &mdash;  not in the slightest. They have their own agenda. Could it be more obvious?</p>

			<p>Martin O&rsquo;Malley is White, just like the people who thought it would be great if we had even more blacks in this country.  </p>
<p>I would speculate that if you offered most black Africans a chance to come to this country on the condition they completed 10 years of endentured servitude, they would not hesitate to do so.  I don&rsquo;t blame the African for wanting to come to the USA.  </p>
<p>It is Whites who are destroying Christendom.</p>

			<p>Oh really? And it is a wonder why Maryland has a phenomenon known as the &ldquo;white flight&rdquo; occurring? But O&rsquo;Malley just can&rsquo;t seem to figure that out! Well its not that hard considering that the white working middle class has just recently taken the biggest INCREASE in state taxes ever in Maryland&rsquo;s history to support the non-white community and the illegal alien population! Taxes will constantly have to be risen to make up the difference for the white flight until the state looks like Detroit. Then who is going to pay, O&rsquo;Malley! </p>

			<p>More hand outs to minorities and nonwhite immigrants, while robbing the White taxpayers even more. Don&rsquo;t Whites ever wake up to these scams? Do they even care? What kind of country do they think they are leaving to their children? A better one?  What fools.</p>

<p>What is he going to pay them with?  Maryland is in much better shape than Calif., N.Y., Vermont, New Jersey, but that in no way implies they&rsquo;re not in big trouble right now, worried about meeting their budget, especially for the coming year. They&rsquo;ve had to cut spending several times recently to assure they could pay their bills.</p>
<p>Psying for such a hare-brained commission, instead of preparing for more cuts and conserving what money they have, is one reason people literally despise the actions of politicians, spending money they don&rsquo;t really have.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that they&rsquo;re so fiscally irresponsible, because it&rsquo;s not their money they&rsquo;re wasting.</p>
<p>Cunsumer spending rose briefly, but is heading downwards again.  The states with sales and income taxes are being dealt devastating blows, yet this is just the beginning.  Wait until this time next year.</p>
<p>As many people have said recently, &#8220;Maybe this economic collapse is exactly what we need to straighten things out, once and for all. </p>

			<p>Now watch Maryland go down the toilet with ghettos.  Just what we DID NOT NEED, more afrikans to leech on the taxpayers, with the help of a traitor white governor!   O&rsquo;Malley needs to be IMPEACHED!  And the obamination government gets ever bigger and more gluttonous.</p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t it curious how mass immigration is supposed to be such a boon for this nation but we have to keep doling out tax dollars to help the immigrants?  Especially if they&rsquo;re from Africa.</p>

			<p>Just a grim thought about politicians spending money they don&rsquo;t have&hellip;  they know that a timely war takes the populace&rsquo;s mind off economics.  </p>
<p>Policy-makers warn that an economic downturn can spark ethnic and racial conflicts.   By accomodating more African immigration, are they deliberately piling a bonfire? </p>

			<p>Just recently I read in a newspaper where three africans and one african-american were arrested for attempting to kidnap a woman from an upscale neighborhood for ransom. Why we have citizens who keep bringing people into this country who will ultimately attempt to do us grevious harm is beyond me. </p>

			<p>Unless you are a white refugee from S. Africa fleeing for your life.  Then, not only is there no &#8220;commision&#8221; for you, but you are not even allowed entry into the U.S. due to your predisposition to &#8220;racism&#8221;. Our country is so whacked, but I know I&rsquo;m preaching to the choir.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Gov. Martin O&rsquo;Malley has created a new commission to help business and community development interests of African immigrants who have come to Maryland.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, White Western Ruling Elites creating commissions, organizations and tools to elevate Blacks and Hispanics, that alienate Whites and promote &#8220;white flight.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what is &#8220;white flight?&#8221;  White flight is the abandoning and giving away to others what the White Man has built and developed. </p>
<p>Again, the big traitors, the big promoters and destroyers of White Western Culture and Civilization are the powerful Ruling Whites, not the Blacks and Hispanics who have benefited. Until the Ruling Elite are educated, or replaced, the decline and death of America will continue. </p>
<p>Without the power and support of the White Ruling Elite the only choice of the rest of White Westerners will be &#8220;white flight.&#8221; </p>
<p>Say it again Sam: The Ruling Elite do indeed determine our values, culture, AND future.</p>

			<p>One would have thought that black Africans were already multiplying at a rate sufficient to maintain a dominant presence for the foreseeable future. Why we&rsquo;re allowing any black immigration at all is a timely issue, let alone trying to entice them to come here in ever-increasing numbers. They&rsquo;re already overwhelmingly the criminal class in America, as they are any place else they&rsquo;re found in significant numbers.</p>
<p>No doubt the citizens of Maryland are celebrating this initiative.</p>

			<p>Karen is right. White Africans cannot be allowed to come here. In fact, how many Whites from the world over do you see coming here? I will wager not even 1% out of the 100% of immigrants yearly are Whites. Look at the Whites being slaughtered in South Africa and they don&rsquo;t even qualify for a refugee status? But these Black immigrants qualify? Isn&rsquo;t something even more sinister going on here? Sleep on, you gullible White folk to your own demise.</p>

			<p>What amuses me so much (one must find humor in these depressing times) is conflict between African-Africans and African-Americans. They don&rsquo;t get along. Black Americans(SHOCK!) regard them as invaders taking up the few resources set aside for them. They have no cultural connections. Africans look at American blacks as ungrateful lazy leeches&hellip; until they learn that that is the game is played here in the USA, and that the working man is a sucker when you can just go on welfare. </p>
