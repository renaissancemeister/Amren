<h1><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-05-05-race-depression_N.htm">Racism Hurts Kids&rsquo; Mental Health</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fifth-graders who feel they&rsquo;ve been mistreated because of their skin color are much more likely than classmates without such feelings to have symptoms of mental disorders, especially depression, a study suggests.</p>
<p>There is evidence that racial discrimination increases the odds that adolescents and adults will develop mental health problems, but this is the first study to examine a possible link in children of varied races, says Tumaini Coker, the study co-author and a RAND Corp. researcher and UCLA pediatrician.</p>
<p>{snip} It&rsquo;s possible that prejudice harms children&rsquo;s mental health, but it is also possible that troubled kids prompt more discriminatory remarks from peers or that children with emotional problems perceive more bias, says study leader Mark Schuster, a Harvard pediatrician and pediatrics chief at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Boston.</p>
<p>The link between perceived racism and mental disorders is strong, he adds. For example, Hispanics who report racism are more than three times as likely as other children to have symptoms of depression; blacks are more than twice as likely; and those of &#8220;other&#8221; minority races have almost quadruple the odds. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prejudice was reported by 20% of blacks, 15% of Hispanics, 16% in the &#8220;other&#8221; category and 7% of whites.</p>
<p>Hispanics had the worst mental health effects, the study shows; perceptions of bias significantly increased their symptoms of all four disorders. About four out of five Hispanic children who felt prejudice had foreign-born parents. Black parents may buffer their children better, perhaps preparing them to expect some racism, Schuster speculates.</p>
<p>The study asked students whether they &#8220;ever&#8221; experienced racism, and that raises a question, says Rebecca Bigler, a University of Texas psychologist. {snip}</p>

<p>Objectives. We sought to describe the prevalence, characteristics, and mental health problems of children who experience perceived racial/ethnic discrimination.</p>
<p>Methods. We analyzed cross-sectional data from a study of 5147 fifth-grade students and their parents from public schools in 3 US metropolitan areas. We used multivariate logistic regression (overall and stratified by race/ethnicity) to examine the associations of sociodemographic factors and mental health problems with perceived racial/ethnic discrimination.</p>
<p>Results. Fifteen percent of children reported perceived racial/ethnic discrimination, with 80% reporting that discrimination occurred at school. A greater percentage of Black (20%), Hispanic (15%), and other (16%) children reported perceived racial/ethnic discrimination compared with White (7%) children. Children who reported perceived racial/ethnic discrimination were more likely to have symptoms of each of the 4 mental health conditions included in the analysis: depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder. An association between perceived racial/ethnic discrimination and depressive symptoms was found for Black, Hispanic, and other children but not for White children.</p>
<p>Conclusions. Perceived racial/ethnic discrimination is not an uncommon experience among fifth-grade students and may be associated with a variety of mental health disorders.<br>

			<p> So they ask the kids if they&rsquo;ve ever experienced &#8220;racism,&#8221; huh? Any effort made to define for them just what is meant by &#8220;racism&#8221;? Or is it just assumed that nowadays everybody and his dog knows what that means? And here&rsquo;s another thought: Perhaps when you raise certain groups of kids   &mdash;   specifically, blacks and Hispanics   &mdash;   in school to expect that they will be &#8220;discriminated against&#8221; (how ever THAT&rsquo;S defined) by we nasty old White people, they&rsquo;ll start to imagine things that aren&rsquo;t really there! Like the little bias upon the stair, who wasn&rsquo;t there again today, and how they wish he&rsquo;d go away?</p>

			<p>And how would a 10- or 11-year old &#8220;feel that s/he&rsquo;s been discriminated against?&#8221;  My bet is that the teachers are reaching as far deep as possible and stretching the truth as far as they can in order to come up with as many discrimination victims as possible, i.e. they&rsquo;re coaching the kids.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Racial discrimination makes children feel bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, but making innocent white children feel guilty and racist for things they had no part of makes them feel guilty and intimidated. </p>
<p>The best way to solve the racial problem is segregation of the races.  Separate but equal is the only solution to the problem, just as legalizing drugs is the only way to stop the power grab and Mexican takeover of drug gangs.</p>
<p>The solutions are there and possible but so long as the elites deny reality.<br>

As a control, we need to find out if incidents of mental illness are fewer in majority minority communities. Are blacks in majority black schools and neighborhoods mentally healthier living without racism?</p>
<p>This is also a chicken/egg situation. It could be that those who have mental illnesses simply perceive racial interactions as racist. After all, a paranoid person would be paranoid.</p>
<p>And remember, a perception is only an internal belief. What a person perceives and what they actually experience are two different things. </p>

			<p>A case of already troubled non-white kids being handed an excuse to blame whites. This study also provides an excellent justification for segregated schools. Perhaps it isn&rsquo;t discrimination that causes the mental health issues, perhaps it is the inherent tension of diverse school environments.</p>

<p>For that matter, it would be interesting to know whether any white kids who have been assaulted by blacks or mestizos because of their race (see &#8220;Jena&#8221;) were included in this &#8220;study.&#8221; Of course, the actual physical health of white children is far less important than the precious &#8220;feelings&#8221; of black and mestizo &#8220;youth.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I would venture a guess that the kids have been systematically taught that any slight against a minority is somehow &#8220;racism&#8221; or &#8220;discrimination&#8221;. White kids are contantly taught that they are racist and must literally walk on eggshells so that they do not offend anyone. However the White kids are the ones that are really and truly discriminated against. They are either kept out of programs designed to help kids who are behind in school, held back in dumbed down programs or subjected to ridiculous &#8220;White guilt&#8221; sessions. </p>

			<p>Do you know what really hurts a 10 year old kid in school? It is being beat up, assaulted, sexually harrassed, and robbed by your 12 year old Black class mates. A good percentage of black boys are held back 2 years by the 5th grade.<br>
     By the sixth grade these thugs weigh about 175 pounds and scare their teachers and principals half to death. As bad as the 5th and 6th grades are, middle school is much the worse. 12 year old white boys and girls confronted by 16 year old gang bangers. Nobody seems to care about the mental health of white kids until they snap after years of bullying and shoot up the school. Anyone who keeps their white, Asian or intelligent black kid in a public school that is at least 10% black ghettorite should be indicted for child abuse.<br>

			<p>Yes, but what is THEIR definition of racism! They get an &#8216;F&rsquo; and the White guy gets an &#8216;A&rsquo; so it&rsquo;s racissss! The White neighbor has three trees in their yard and they only have two, their White friend drives a BMW and they drive a Chevy! Believe me, alot of blacks would take those as signs of racism.</p>

			<p>All of this obsession about fighting &#8220;racism&#8221; is itself a kind of mass hysteria   &mdash;   in other words, a mass mental illness. </p>
<p>Hysteria about this cultural construct called &#8220;racism&#8221; is analogous to a Baptist preacher ranting against &#8220;sin&#8221;. The USA (and much of the West nowadays) is like a superstitious little backwater filled with these ranting preachers. </p>
<p>All of you leftoids (we all know the SPLC and other similar groups read this) should come to the realization that cultures and races are not equal. Observe this reality and come to your senses. </p>

			<p>Anonymous,</p>
<p>I worked on that antenna on top of Brooklyn Tech years ago. Then it was an all White school.</p>
<p>Then I worked on the Tel. building up on the corner Flatbush  and Dekalb. and it was becoming somewhat Oriental and the blacks were demonstrating to get blacks into the school regardless of the entrance tests.</p>
<p>Later, I worked on the hospital and when I would pass by in the evening going to the G train, most of the kids were Oriental.</p>
<p>Interesting change over the years.</p>

			<p>Well, there&rsquo;s no denying prejudice. It happens. Its the extent to which it occurs that is unclear. The numbers seem about right and I would say that whilst minority discrimination is falling, discrimination towards white americans appears to be rising, as a result of reverse discrimination. This can&rsquo;t be allowed to happen. If minorities are being better treated, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that whites must be discriminated against in order to correct past wrongs. These are only kids. Whether their great great great grandparents had an army of slaves, or was a Klansmen, is irrelevent to the treatment they should receive.</p>

			<p>I definitely took some racist guff in school from brown and black kids. Somehow I never managed to get into a physical fight with a black or brown kid, because that would have been big trouble. This kind of racial bullying puts a big tax on white kids growing up. And guaranteed: if a white kid stands up to black or brown kids, other white kids will almost never back them up. Use a racial slur back after enduring being called gringo, honky, cracker by gangs of blacks or browns (they always travel in groups), and a white female school administrator will make sure that goes in your file. </p>
<p>It goes both ways though. Lots of whites like to think that blacks are &#8220;imagining&#8221; racism in daily interactions. No, most whites don&rsquo;t like the way blacks look or the way they act and probably have bad personal experiences with blacks getting out of control in one way or another. It shows in small details that blacks notice. When you tense up around blacks, that shows and they &#8220;know you are racist.&#8221; Blacks have an extremely keen sense for sniffing out who has a bias against them. </p>
<p>What is ridiculous is that most whites have strong racial preferences in reality, especially the rich oh-so-smart liberals. Most adult whites avoid blacks, would never ever date or marry a black, don&rsquo;t socialize with them, are scared of blacks, and yet? They deny deny deny and do absurd things (like voting for a candidate just because he is black) to prove they are not biased. That has resulted in a completely screwed up country. </p>
<p>The blacks are right. Race is real and you might was well Know Thyself and realize what your inner reactions are telling you. </p>

<p>Amen.</p>
<p><i>it is also possible that troubled kids prompt more discriminatory remarks from peers or that children with emotional problems perceive more bias </i></p>
<p>Kids can be cruel little bastards, give them any excuse to single you out for ridicule. <br>
You&rsquo;re too smart, too dumb, too tall, too short, your parents are poor, your parents are rich whatever it is kids will pick on you. Birds of a feather stick together.<br>
I haven&rsquo;t meet many people who have gone through their childhood without some teasing.</p>
<p><i>About four out of five Hispanic children who felt prejudice had foreign-born parents.</i></p>
<p>Language issues perhaps?<br>
I fear the the finger will be pointed all the &#8216;racist&rsquo; white parents for bringing children into this world who notice differences.</p>

<p>Wrong. The obsession with racism is an attempt to berate and train people to squash their natural reactions under extremely unnatural conditions. Environments where you come in contact with many kinds of people who do not look, think, worship, or feel like you cause immense levels of stress and anxiety. Particularly when non-whites have very strong group protection instincts that cause them to gang up on whites. </p>
<p>All the hysterics against &#8220;racism&#8221; are an attempt to make sure whites have lots of mental noise and Pavlovian conditioning to alienate and estrange them from their natural reaction to band together to re-establish a more natural environment. </p>

			<p>Making children feel like victims and that the world is out to hold them back is depressing and cruel as well.  These white liberals are more harm than help.  Not only that, putting white kids on a guilt trip and making them feel like they are responsible for all the ills of the world is equally as bad.</p>

<p>The game plan is to play one group of suckers against the other using false promises and psychological intimidation. Today it&rsquo;s use the blacks and Mexicans against the whites in the USA for &#8220;equality and civil rights.&#8221; Meanwhile use the whites against the Muslims in the Middle East to &#8220;protect our country from terrorism and spread democracy.&#8221; If manipulated one group of suckers begins to dominate too much, the game plan changes immediately to play against the new majority group. </p>
<p>The other part of the game is to bring incompatible people together and hold them there against their inner will and feed off the suppressed conflict and anxiety that this creates in society. This puts the victims in a constant fearful and confused state that makes them easy targets and pawns. </p>

			<p>Tom Iron: This is off the subject, but are you an Ironworker? I ask because several months ago someone posted about their adventures with blacks on the job site. Being in the industry myself, I would love to hear more</p>

			<p>how many of these kids deal with whites? they go to segregated schools! Brown v Board of Education is a joke. America is more segregated than ever The danger comes from fellow blacks or Hispanics who kill their own people at rates far in excess of white caused homicides.  </p>
<p>Another liberal crock. Aided by gullible doctors from &#8220;top&#8221; schools of course. If these idiots want to know about racism, they can visit Sudan, South Africa or Tibet. I&rsquo;d say read about these places but most of these losers in ghettoes cant read, whether they are mentally ill or not.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Do you know what really hurts a 10 year old kid in school? It is being beat up, assaulted, sexually harrassed, and robbed by your 12 year old Black class mates. A good percentage of black boys are held back 2 years by the 5th grade.<br>
By the sixth grade these thugs weigh about 175 pounds and scare their teachers and principals half to death. As bad as the 5th and 6th grades are, middle school is much the worse. 12 year old white boys and girls confronted by 16 year old gang bangers. &#8220;</p>
<p>Charles Tiffany  I completely agree.  Even if the blacks are not 2 years older, they are still much bigger than the White kids from about age 9 to 16 due to the different puberty and maturity rates of different races.  It is really bad for the North European White and Asian boys.  There they are, 12 years old, 4ft8, 75 pds being beaten and abused by 5ft6 170 pd blacks. It is especially bad for boys born after May first.  They are months behind the in their grade.</p>

			<p>to margaret who is concerned about white children being assaulted by black kids in middle schools: whatever it takes, never have a white child attend a majority or near majority black school. I really think, based on teaching experience I&rsquo;ve had, that up to ten percent black, violence usually can be controlled by the administrators. After that,  the blacks are cutting classes, in the halls, controlling who goes where,and invading classrooms. The police are never called.</p>
<p>Move to New Hampshire or North Dakota if you have to. The vast majority of blacks go to all black schools or schools they &#8220;share&#8221; with immigrants from Latin America. These are holding areas until these losers get to be picked up and incarcerated.  It would be cheaper to put them in work camps and on work details starting at 13. They are going NOWHERE.  Keep your white child away from them.</p>

			<p>The article states that 7% of white kids experience racism in school. I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that for the white kids in black majority schools, that number must be 100%. The form of racism felt by these kids is not the perceiced racism no doubt claimed by the vast majority of the black students, such as someone looking at you funny. No, the racism felt by the unfortunate white kids is physical.</p>
<p>Detroit 1968, I was in fourth grade. That year the first black kids came to my school. These kids were accepted and treated decently from the first day. Many of the kids went out their way to befriend them. In fact, they were almost treated like rock stars. I never saw or heard of anything wrong happening to them. </p>
<p>In 1973, I was to attend black majority Winship Junior High Junior High, where my older sister was subject to much harrassment the year before. First day, I was chased down and beat up by three black kids. One week later, when i gathered the courage to return to school, the same thing happened. My folks got me transfered to a different school where there were few black kids. The black kids in this school were treated in a decent manner just as in elementary school. </p>
<p>Cooley High 1974, chased down and beat up. Transfered to Henry Ford where I was never beat up but had to tolerate much harrassment in the (my guess} 30% black school. </p>
<p>I wound up with a GED.<br>

			<p>A hispanic or black kid getting some looks or some condescending comments from whites pales in comparison to getting mugged or beat up or having your property vandalized.</p>
