	<p>Australia will cut its intake of migrants for the first time in a decade, the government said on Monday, amid concern that skilled foreign workers could stoke resentment by taking jobs at a time of rising unemployment.</p>
<p>With a recession looming and the centre-left government expecting unemployment to reach 7 per cent by mid-2010, Immigration Minister Chris Evans said the intake of skilled migrants would be reduced by about 14 per cent.</p>
<p>Australia goes to the polls in late 2010 and immigration has been a charged issue in past polls, particularly following economic downturn.</p>
<p>A leading migration expert, former government official Bob Kinnaird, said record recent migrant arrivals in a fast shrinking job market were leading to &#8220;highly combustible&#8221; conditions in regional areas, where many new arrivals had settled.</p>
<p>Australia is a nation of immigrants and has been enjoying a boom in new arrivals for the past decade to help meet labour shortages as a China-fuelled mining boom drove unemployment rates to 30-year lows.</p>
<p>But six of Australia&rsquo;s major trading partners are now in recession and economic growth has stalled. The country moved a step closer to recession this month with the first contraction in eight years and the economy shrinking by 0.5 per cent.</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s jobless rate spiked to 5.2 per cent from 4.8 per cent last month with the biggest impact felt by full-time workers. Some economists fear unemployment levels could go as high as 10 per cent.</p>
<p>Evans said the immigration intake next year would be cut to 115,000, from 133,500 in 2008-09.</p>
<p>In major resource states Queensland and Western Australia, retrenched mine workers returning to their home towns found that jobs there had been filled by foreign workers, sparking resentment, Kinnaird said. &#8220;You could say in those last few months that madness has reigned,&#8221; he told the Brisbane Times newspaper.</p>
<p>The ruling Labor Party, with its roots in the workers&rsquo; movement, should have acted sooner to cut migration as economic conditions cooled to lance any voter backlash and ease tensions in critical country voting areas, he said.</p>
<p>But the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the government needed to be wary of tinkering with immigration, as many skilled employment areas still faced a worker shortage and lack of workers could crimp an economic recovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would have preferred a status quo position,&#8221; chamber Chief Executive Peter Anderson said.</p>
<p>Evans, who removed hairdressers and cooks off Australia&rsquo;s critical occupation shortage list at Christmas, said he was now also deleting foreign bricklayers, plumbers, carpenters and electricians from the list that guides skilled migration intake.</p>
<p>Further cuts were likely in the May 12 budget, he said, leaving only health occupations, engineering and information technology skills as needed skills.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&rsquo;ll look to do is run a smaller programme and keep the capacity to make sure we can bring in any labour we might need as the year develops,&#8221; Evans said.</p>
<p>The government hopes its recently announced A$42 billion ($27.5 billion) stimulus package, including cash handouts and infrastructure spending, will help the economy through the downturn.<br>

						<p>
							<i>Malayalam News (Kerala, India), May 20, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>New Zealand is not likely to follow Australia in cutting immigration to protect local jobs during the current recession, Prime Minister John Key indicated Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;New Zealand needs skilled migrants to grow,&#8221; he said under questioning at his weekly news conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a skills deficit and while that may abate slightly because of the downturn in the economy and growing unemployment, we still need to make sure we have got enough skills to grow our economy and develop further,&#8221; Key said.</p>
<p>He said New Zealand had a target of about 45,000 skilled immigrants a year and &#8220;while it&rsquo;s always possible that the minister may recommend some changes, it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s top of mind at the moment&#8221;.</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s Immigration Minister Chris Evans announced Monday that its skilled migration programme would be clipped by 14 percent, or 18,500 jobs, over the next three years. The total number of immigrants, which has doubled over the past decade, will be reduced from 133,500 this year to 115,000 next year.</p>
<p>Key noted that Australia&rsquo;s immigrant intake had increased much more rapidly than New Zealand&rsquo;s.<br>

			<p>In the case of Australia, even if it comes to pass, then it&rsquo;s still a bad course.  Australia only has 18 million white people.  It only takes a small percentage of people from countries to the north of them that have 100 million plus people, like Indonesia, China, India, to &#8220;move&#8221; to Australia, and its whites are totally swamped.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering what it&rsquo;s going to take to get these hare-brained types to understand that bringing in more mouths to feed, water, and warm bodies to find jobs for, is idiotic and could well be the one traceable reason the country could very well explode into all out civil upheaval.</p>
<p>Surely they&rsquo;re not so silly as to expect the economy is going to keep growing and they&rsquo;ll be short of labor.</p>
<p>Wait a minute&hellip;..yes, they are that silly.  The entire West is now controlled by radical leftists who haven&rsquo;t an ounce of brains and even less common sense.</p>
<p>Or, are they like the New York Times and other radical leftist, agenda driven ideologues who will pursue their rainbow scheme even if it kills every one of them?</p>
<p>Michael Savage was so right when he said that liberalism is a mental disorder.</p>

			<p>Australia will cut its intake of migrants .</p>
<p>By this comment I would assume the Australian gov can cut LEGAL immigration&hellip;HOWEVER! they can do nothing about the illegal muslim migration/invasion from Indonesia. And NZs prime minister Key, is going to be sorry he said THIS &#8220;&ldquo;New Zealand needs skilled migrants to grow,&rdquo; in the not to distant future and so will many Kiwis. Again, those immigrants will be Indonesian muslims.</p>

<p>It couldn&rsquo;t be much clearer how seriously they&rsquo;re addicted to cheap labor.  The more immigrants are brought in, the worse the shortages seem to get, and yet the chamber of commerce keeps crying out &#8220;more&#8221;!  Now with this very modest cutback in the offing   &mdash;   which only reduces immigration to levels of a few years ago   &mdash;  they squirm and itch like an addict denied his daily fix.  Sometimes going cold turkey is the only way to break such a vicious cycle.</p>

<p>Hear that? Politicians respond to resentment. Resentment could lead to a loss of votes, which in turn, would force politicians to act. Is there an Australian National Party?</p>

			<p>Phew, &#8220;slashed&#8221; by a whole 14%!  Yowzer.</p>
<p>The whole charade gives the impression that immigration levels are &#8220;carefully managed&#8221; so as to be optimal for the country.  &#8220;Hmm, this year we would have needed precisely 134,241 but with <i>this</i> economy, that&rsquo;s going to have to be reworked to 114,589.&#8221;  The whole sham.</p>
<p>But&hellip;what can you tell a people intent on suicide?</p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;New Zealand needs skilled migrants to grow&rdquo; - NZ PM John Key</i></p>
<p>The islands of New Zealand are growing? I wasn&rsquo;t aware of that. Fascinating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Growth&#8221; is about increasing each individual&rsquo;s share of the pie, not just about increasing the size of the overall pie. If the current citizens of New Zealand don&rsquo;t benefit then what good does it do?</p>
<p>Modern people, and politicians especially, have no idea how to deal with rates when it comes to immigration. Most people only deal with rates when it comes to money, where %1 is really low, either as a return on investment or as a loan rate. 1% as related to immigration, however, is very, very, high.</p>
<p>First of all, populations do not grow annually because they do not reproduce annually. They reproduce in generations, and a generation today, in Western countries, is actually somewhere around 30 years. So if you import 1% of your population each year in immigrants then in the course of a single generation, with only replacement birthrates, over 35% of your population will be a result of the last 30 years of immigration. Within 2 generations the immigrants and their children and grandchildren will outnumber the natives.</p>
<p>Even half a percent immigration is very, very high. It is, in fact, a cultural and ethnic death sentence.</p>

			<p>Skilled migration to New Zealand is largely from the UK and China, but also from the US, Germany, India, South Africa (white). Previous governments in New Zealand have confused SKILL shortage with LABOUR shortage, perhaps to forward their leftist agenda but under the new National Party government this may change.</p>

			<p>Reducing immigration by 14% from current levels does not amount to &#8220;slashing&#8221; Australian immigration. Australia until recently has been importing immigrants at the rate of 0.7% of its population each and every year. In population terms that&rsquo;s huge. In historical terms, in most countries, that&rsquo;s huge. The truth is that with the immigration levels they&rsquo;ve seen lately nothing less than an 80% decrease would amount to a &#8220;slash.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;New Zealand needs skilled migrants to grow,&rdquo;</p>
<p>To grow WHAT, exactly?</p>
<p>What the prime minister of New Zealand really means is &#8220;New Zealand needs skilled migrants to grow the bank balances of the super rich elite, who need MORE people living in worse conditions, just so that we can take even MORE money from them than we already do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Limitless &#8216;growth&rsquo; is clearly impossible. Why don&rsquo;t people call this fool (and others like him) and ask him just how many more people New Zealand will need before it has had ENOUGH so-called &#8216;growth&rsquo;?</p>
<p>What about standard of living PER CAPITA?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worse than that. The only increase you should really look at is the increase in people of child-bearing age. Most immigrants are of child-bearing age and in the process of having families. If you have 10 million people, 24% of child-bearing age, and you have 100,000 immigrants all of child-bearing age (or 1% of your population), then 4% of your breeding population now consists of immigrants. </p>
<p>People really, really, really have no concept of &#8220;rate&#8221; when it comes to immigration or population growth, or any idea of what a reasonable rate might be.<br>

			<p>Great point Anonymous at 3:27 PM on May 22&hellip;there is a very appropriate quote regarding this issue: &#8220;Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell.&#8221; - environmentalist Edward Abbey</p>
<p>I for one do not wish to live in a country which has been entirely paved over and all nature has been obliterated for the sake of bad restaurants, stupid retail stores, and ugly ofices just so a bunch of immigrants can become obedient lil&rsquo; hyperconsumers.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve yet to figure out what is wrong with politicians who keep cramming immigration down everyone&rsquo;s throats. Are they that beholden to special interests that they would ruine the country so that a few farmers can have cheaper labor? I don&rsquo;t need cheap lettuce that badly.</p>

			<p>&#8221;The ruling Labor Party, with its roots in the workers&rsquo; movement &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s your answer. No doubt the trade union bosses are more interested in world socialism than looking after their workers&rsquo; or the country&rsquo;s interests. With media magnate Rupert Murdoch, a member of the Australian Fabian Society, in charge of the media in that part of the world, there&rsquo;s little doubt the same neo-Marxist groups who are destroying all other white-majority countries are also in charge of Australia. These political elites always have a sham opposition in order to pretend we are living in a democracy. Some democracy. Even now Sarkozy is a vocal critic of Turkey&rsquo;s proposed entry into the EU. But of course he&rsquo;ll be overruled by his neo-Marxist cronies. It&rsquo;s all a sham. Only with the replacement of these political, banking and media elites will ordinary people in white-majority countries be saved from mass immigration/multiculturalism and eventual extinction.</p>
