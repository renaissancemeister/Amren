<h1>Immigrants&rsquo; Children Might Get Help From DREAM Act</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Víctor Manuel Ramos, Orlando Sentinel, May 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Like Lara, tens of thousands of young immigrants were brought here illegally as children. They have grown up American, speaking English and attending schools. But if caught, they are still deported.</p>
<p>A bill that would help them gain permanent residency, known as the DREAM Act, is gathering some traction in Congress. The act would grant a probationary form of legalization to immigrants brought here before age 16, who have a high school diploma or its equivalent and who are deemed to be persons of good moral character. Going to college or enrolling in the military could help their cases.</p>
<p>For Lara of Sorrento, a former high school honor student trained in computer graphics, this is the only country he has ever known.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel that I belong in the United States,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have spent my whole life here.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His world came crashing down earlier this year when immigration agents arrested him and held him for weeks in a detention facility in South Florida.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably too late for the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act to help Lara. The bill has a growing list of sponsors in the House and Senate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cases such as Lara&rsquo;s, however, are not gaining much sympathy from those who want to stop illegal immigration and warn that the DREAM Act would lead to a larger amnesty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their parents have put them in a very difficult situation,&#8221; said Roy Beck, director of Numbers USA, a Washington, D.C. group that advocates for reduced immigration levels. &#8220;We can&rsquo;t just keep having one amnesty after another without fixing the fundamental problem.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We have magnets that invite people to become illegal aliens because we make it so easy for them to hold jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lara and others in his situation feel as if they are being treated unfairly. They never broke the law. Their parents did.</p>

			<p>Amnesty for the children would also be in effect amnesty for the parents.  For once DREAM gives the kids amnesty, then the parents will demand to say under the pretense that they have to be there to supervise their children.  The Federal judiciary would see to that.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t care if Lara never broke the law.  I didn&rsquo;t either, but I&rsquo;m forced to pay.  I refuse to listen to any sob stories.  No one cares about the Whites who are displaced, run over, robbed, taxed, or suffer any of the other consequences of the Brown Tide, so I will not care about the misfortunes of non-Whites.  <br>
     The Left always puts the plight of children up in front of the camera, and always conceals the ugly consequences of our misplaced charity.  The suffering kids are just a mask the Reds use to hide their evil.  </p>

			<p>This actually doesn&rsquo;t worry me.  Every time they trot out the DREAM Act or any type of amnesty, NumbersUSA, CAPS, &amp; others organize a calling/faxing blitz so well that Congress gets smacked.  I&rsquo;ve started looking at these dumb measures as an opportunity to show populist might.  </p>
<p>Of course, as long as there is no measure similar to HR 4437, de facto amnesty is constantly in effect.  However, it&rsquo;s still better than a legal amnesty.</p>

			<p>A real tear jerkier of a story. Why don&rsquo;t they write about the 10s of thousands kids that are in gangs? Why don&rsquo;t they write about the drugs, the killings, the rapes and other crime these young illegals are involved in? </p>
<p>Because it wouldn&rsquo;t fit their created image of how unfair we are to these poor honest hardworking kids. For every Lara we would get thousands of MS-13 members. </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.brought here before age 16&#8221; <br>
Does that mean no matter how long they were brought here, just as long as they were under 16 they can still get amnesty? So as adults long past the age of 16 would they would still qualify?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.who have a high school diploma or its equivalent&#8221; <br>
A lot of kids have those and still can&rsquo;t read the words written on them.<br>
  <br>
&#8220;who are deemed to be persons of good moral character.&#8221;<br>
Good moral character by who&rsquo;s standards ours or theirs?</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to college&hellip;.&#8221;<br>
Yeah more instate tuition fees for illegals at taxpayer expense.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;enrolling in the military could help their cases.&#8221;<br>
Remember the National Guardsmen that were caught transporting illegal immigrants in military vehicles?  We sure need more of that.</p>
<p>One of the best weapon in the left&rsquo;s arsenal for the assault on our country is the cry, &#8220;It&rsquo;s for the children.&#8221;</p>

			<p>My &#8220;representative&#8221; Carolyn McCarthy is voting for this wretched bill.  What brought Carolyn McCarthy into politics was the murder of her husband by the black man, Colin Ferguson, in the Long Island Railroad massacre.  Ferguson shot as many white people (and one Asian woman) as he could.  Six people died and 19 were injured.  His motive was solely anti-white hatred.</p>
<p>So was McCarthy&rsquo;s first run for a House seat based on a program of combatting virulent anti white racism among non-whites?  Of course not.  In her mind her husband was not murdered by a white hating black man.  He was murdered by a gun.  Apparently the gun stood on it&rsquo;s hind legs and shot her husband, all by itself.  So Carolyn McCarthy ran on a strong anti-gun platform, and is now the biggest gun grabber in the House.</p>
<p>If New York had a concealed carry law Ferguson would have been taken out before he killed his third victim.  But no liberal is capable of thinking straight.  McCarthy&rsquo;s solution to the violence that deprived her of her husband is to make sure law abiding whites remain defenseless before black criminals who will have guns no matter what the law is.</p>
