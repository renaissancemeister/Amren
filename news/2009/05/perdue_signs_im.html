<h1>Perdue Signs Immigration Bill</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, May 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gov. Sonny Perdue has signed a bill that would penalize local governments for failing to check the immigration status of people that they hire and those receiving public benefits.</p>
<p>The measure is designed to put teeth in a 2006 law cracking down on illegal immigration in Georgia. That law required governments and companies that do government business to use federal databases to check the immigration status of those that they hire. But there was no penalty for failing to do so.</p>
<p>GOP lawmakers said some local governments were ignoring the law. Under the new measure, governments that fail to run the checks could lose funds in the state budget. The new law takes effect Jan. 1.</p>

								<h2>If Perdue Signs Bill, Immigration Laws Will Tighten</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Mary Lou Pickel, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, April 18, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Georgia&rsquo;s crackdown on illegal immigration will continue if Gov. Sonny Perdue signs into law a measure approved by the General Assembly requiring more jail checks that could lead to deportation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The measure, House Bill 2, updates sections of the Georgia Security and Immigration Compliance Act of 2006, a comprehensive crackdown on illegal immigration in Georgia. It is awaiting Perdue&rsquo;s signature.</p>
<p>Georgia law already requires jailers to check legal status and report any illegal immigrants charged with a felony, DUI or driving without a license. Under House Bill 2, jailers also would be required to alert federal agents when they encounter an illegal immigrant charged with misdemeanors of a &#8220;high and aggravated nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, the bill requires that public employers and contractors use a federal database to verify that new hires are not illegal immigrants, and that those who receive public benefits  &mdash;  from welfare to a business license  &mdash;  are in the U.S. legally. Local governments that don&rsquo;t comply could lose state road-building money, the measure says.</p>
<p>Jerry Gonzalez, head of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, called the bill a waste of time. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is that immigration reform is coming,&#8221; Gonzalez said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><br>
AN OVERVIEW</p>
<p>Outcome of immigration-related bills in this year&rsquo;s Legislature</p>
<p>Passed:</p>
<p>H.B. 2: Broadens conditions for jailers to check the legal status of inmates, could lead to more deportations. Also, requires all government employers to use the federal E-Verify database to check the legal status of new hires. Requires governments to use the federal SAVE database to check legal status of those seeking public benefits. Governments could lose state road-building dollars if they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>S.B. 86: Requires proof of citizenship to register to vote.</p>
<p>S.B. 20: Prohibits local governments from establishing &#8220;sanctuary policies.&#8221; Requires local officials to cooperate with federal agents to report immigration status. Threatens withholding of state dollars for non-compliance.</p>
<p>Failed:</p>
<p>S.B. 67: English-only driver&rsquo;s license tests.</p>
<p>S.B. 136: Rapid deportation from state prisons.<br>

			<p>Lucky Georgians.  Here in the New York state the legislature would never pass such a bill, and if they did, the governor would never sign it.  I hope Georgia has budgeted some money for the inevitable lawsuit from the pro-illegal immigration ACLU.<br>

			<p>&#8220;[I]mmigration reform is coming.&#8221; Oh yes! Not the kind of immigration reform that good citizens are looking for!<br>
Look to Great Britain where the BNP looks to be doing very well in the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament (what a waste of time that is). The BNP includes a thuggish element that I&rsquo;m not comfortable with. However, where do these fascist commies and so-called liberals get off on vaunting a &#8220;multicultural&#8221; world that no-one ever voted for? Fascists are what they are indeed.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Sonny&#8221; is THE WORST governor our state has had in decades.  He has destroyed Georgia&rsquo;s economy, and has stripped BILLIONS of dollars from higher education (once the envy of the USA) in favor of his pet projects, like promoting Trout Fishing in Georgia (he was oblivious to the DROUGHT our state has been suffering through).</p>
<p>However, on this SINGLE issue, at least Sonny talks the talk.</p>

			<p>Now, if they change the law to imprison local officials who refuse to enforce the laws, they will really have done something!</p>

			<p>WR the elder  &mdash;  5:45 May 17,and besides, Mayor Bloomberg would also be against it. To paraphrase billionaire Mike, &#8220;if illegal aliens get deported, who will take care of the golf courses&#8221;. I just have to keep bringing this stuff up because it sticks in my memory. Why? Because psychologists say that it is the weird, the absurd, the bombastic stuff that sticks in your mind the longest.</p>

			<p>Sonny Perdue the worst? Did you forget Barnes who took away our battle flag state banner? </p>
<p>I voted for &#8220;Perdido&#8221; the first time on his promise to have a referendum on the flag issue.  He did come across with a vote but our battle emblem flag wasn&rsquo;t one of the choices, hence the tag &#8220;chicken Perdue&#8221;.</p>
<p>When Barnes took away the old state flag he made it illegal for counties to fly it on any government property.  So some counties simply said OK and ran up the confederate battle flag instead which cannot be banned since it flies over war memorials and monuments.  </p>
<p>But how exactly did Perdido destroy the state economy?  What did he do to accomplish this?  At least he and the Republicans have done a lot to stop illegals who come in and take jobs.  AND THIS HELPS THE WORKING MAN, BLACK AND WHITE who just happen to be USCs.  </p>
<p>If Perdido did strip billions from higher education, which I doubt, he probably was thinking that state money spent on higher education was a waste anyway that mostly went for the benefit of fools who go around saying stupid things like &#8220;how,&rsquo;bout them dawgs!!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyway I live in South Georgia and we are always forgotten by Atlanta.  In fact we should join North Florida. </p>
