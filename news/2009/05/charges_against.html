			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sharon Coolidge, Cincinnati Enquirer, April 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>UPDATE: The robbery case against three teenagers accused of attacking a woman outside the Westwood library in January was dismissed Friday morning.</p>
<p>Prosecutors dismissed the charge against one boy, admitting they did not have enough evidence to go forward.</p>
<p>When the 18-year-old victim failed to show up for the boys&rsquo; trial in Hamilton County Juvenile Court, Magistrate Elizabeth Igoe dismissed the case against his co-defendants, who also faced robbery charges. Igoe said charges could be re-filed if the witness decides to go forward with the case.</p>
<p>Police say the boys are part of a Westwood gang called the McFarland boys in which boys roamed in packs randomly attacking victims to gain status in the gang. In all, 10 juveniles were arrested.</p>
<p>Two others, including the group&rsquo;s ringleader, were sent to juvenile prison on robbery charges. But the cases have proved difficult to prosecute. Three other boys had cased against them dismissed when victims in those cases failed to show up for court. Another got probation and another wasn&rsquo;t formally charged.</p>
<p>Earlier story:</p>
<p>WESTWOOD  &mdash;  Baby gangster, gangster, old gangster, prince and finally, king.</p>
<p>That was the Westwood youth gang&rsquo;s hierarchy.</p>
<p>Anyone who wanted to advance through those ranks had to randomly attack someone. Depending on what happened, points would be awarded. An attack earned one point, a robbery six.</p>
<p>A boy had to be invited into the gang. Every six points he earned brought a &#8220;promotion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys roamed in a pack, drawing power from their numbers.</p>
<p>They targeted white victims because they believed white people would only call police after being attacked. Black victims, they reasoned, would gather family members and retaliate.</p>
<p>Their victims included a 5-foot-1, 130-pound deaf woman they followed out the Westwood library, a Harrison Avenue businessman who came to the aid of a teenager under attack and a man who had a concealed carry permit and scared them off with his gun.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Westwood Elementary School told authorities trouble was brewing in the early months of the 2008-2009 school year, with near daily fights erupting at school, Detective Mike Roth said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more you fought, the more respect you got,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Some were taking boxing classes to learn how to hit harder and fight better, Roth said.</p>

			<p>This sounds like a hate gang.  SPLC, hello?  This is the first time I&rsquo;m hearing about this gang.  I didn&rsquo;t read about it in the DHS report, or SPLC material (inasmuch as the SPLC didn&rsquo;t write the DHS reports about terrorism).</p>

			<p>Not physicslly resisting a robbery or any other assault is understandable, because the odds usually are against the victim, but not pressing charges against ones assaliants to me is inexcusable.We whites are the worst wimps of all,generally speaking.</p>

<p>Dream on, fellow. You must think that if you trap 4 cockroaches and put them in a little cockroach cage for a few months, then your cockroach troubles are over.</p>
<p>Our admirable justice system, with its careful procedures, careful protections, and short sentences that give persons another chance in life, was designed for a society that was basically orderly and only had a few criminals. </p>
<p>That system is overwhelmed by what we have now.</p>
<p>If this gang hasn&rsquo;t selected a logo to tattoo on its members yet, I suggest a bulls-eye.</p>
<p>Only because that&rsquo;s an easily recognizable symbol that will alert citizens to flee, of course.</p>

			<p>she probably didn&rsquo;t show up for trial because she didn&rsquo;t want to be considered racist.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;a man who had a concealed carry permit and scared them off with his gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is, as far as I can determine, the only effective way to deal with blacks. Now if we whites could engender our own &#8220;no snitching&#8221; rule when it becomes necessary to use force, what a wonderful world it would be.<br>

			<p>&#8220;The boys roamed in a pack, drawing power from their numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Twas ever thus with the pack-dog culture of gangs.</p>
<p>&#8220;They targeted white victims because they believed white people would only call police after being attacked. Black victims, they reasoned, would gather family members and retaliate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet more cultural diversity.  Wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

			<p>THEY choose WHITE victims because THEY know WHITES do not RETALIATE. The reason and the ANSWER to it are both hidden in the first sentence.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Youths&#8221; now seems to be a code words for gangs of non-white young people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Random attacks&#8221; are now code words for black-on-white crimes.</p>

			<p>     Hate crime? If the Knoxxville Horror is not a hate crime then this assault certainly is not. In fact There is almost never a hate crime perpetrated against a White person.Blacks can rape our women, kill our men and bring our culture into ruin with relative impunity.All this is done with the collaboration with white crazies, who want to see their nation and culture die.</p>
