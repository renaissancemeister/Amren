			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Smith, Politico, May 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Republican Party has scarcely begun to repair a wound that threatens to confine it to minority status: its 2006 collapse among Hispanic voters.</p>
<p>Driven by some Republicans&rsquo; sharp attacks on illegal immigration and  &mdash;  as many Hispanics perceived it, immigrants in general  &mdash;  Latino voters fled the GOP en masse in the midterm elections, then turned on John McCain, as well.</p>
<p>He got 31 percent of the Latino vote to the 44 percent that George W. Bush took in 2004, according to exit polls. And it was enough to put much of the West and Southwest out of reach for the Republican Party, to give Florida to the Democrats and to hand Barack Obama the presidency.</p>
<p>Now, as Obama moves to solidify his advantage, Republican leaders are sounding the alarm on what could be the party&rsquo;s most pressing national challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s absolutely urgent. The demographics are there in black and white,&#8221; said former Rep. Henry Bonilla (R-Texas), a casualty of the Hispanic swing to the Democratic Party. &#8220;If we don&rsquo;t figure out a way to open our party up to more Hispanic voters, nothing else we do will matter. Mathematically, we can&rsquo;t get there from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The math is, in fact, simple. Hispanic voters represented 7.4 percent of the electorate in 2008, up from 6 percent in 2004 and 5.4 percent in 2000. And growing Latino populations in the Midwest and the Carolinas stand to give Democrats an edge in a growing number of swing states.</p>
<p>There are stirrings of a Republican response. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has spoken with Hispanic leaders about creating a new organization to back Latino candidates. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele has made minority outreach a priority at the RNC. And some Republicans see an opening if Obama continues to defer action on overhauling immigration.</p>
<p>But so far, there are few visible attempts to reverse the trend.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re making no overt efforts to appeal to Hispanics again,&#8221; said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato, whose new book cites the defection of Hispanics from the Republicans as a central cause of Obama&rsquo;s victory. &#8220;They all know it&rsquo;s a problem. They aren&rsquo;t talking about it, because they fear the anti-immigration wing of their party.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re afraid to even mention the word &#8216;Hispanic,&rsquo;&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Republican Party&rsquo;s difficulty in clawing back to parity with Hispanic voters is illustrated most clearly in Florida, the heartland of Hispanic Republicanism, where its core is an aging, dwindling Cuban émigré base.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Graham said he&rsquo;s considering forming a political action committee, or some other entity, aimed at recruiting strong Hispanic Republican candidates.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can find electable Hispanic candidates, I want to do what I can to create a support system for them, financially and otherwise,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Steele also has emphasized broadening the Republican Party, elevating the RNC&rsquo;s &#8220;coalitions&#8221; division internally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The message, Hispanic Republicans say, is key, and the party faces several challenges.</p>
<p>First, it needs to do away with what polls suggest many Hispanics perceive as raw ethnic animus. A post-election survey of Latino voters by the National Association of Latino Elected Officials found that a mere 8 percent believe that the Republican Party has more concern for the Latino community than do the Democrats.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had some very high-profile Republicans that were almost anti-Hispanic, not anti-illegal-immigration,&#8221; said Frank Guerra, a Republican media consultant in Texas who worked for the campaigns of George W. Bush. &#8220;Republicans need to be much more welcoming, less incendiary and much more thoughtful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond that, there&rsquo;s some debate in Hispanic political circles about whether Hispanics can be won over again on an appeal to more conservative cultural and economic values  &mdash;  part of the Bush campaigns&rsquo; successful push  &mdash;  or whether the GOP needs a new message for that group, as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&rsquo;t keep running ads of white-haired guys eating a taco next to a piñata,&#8221; said Florida fundraiser Navarro [Ana Navarro, a prominent Miami Republican fundraiser]. &#8220;We need ads that have substance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Navarro pointed to immigration as a central issue on which Republicans must change their tone and could steal a step from Obama, who has not clearly signaled whether he&rsquo;ll fulfill a campaign promise to press for immigration reform in his first year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s symbolic: Do you like us, or do you not?&#8221; Navarro said. &#8220;It presents a remarkable opportunity for Republicans to call Obama&rsquo;s bluff and say, &#8216;OK, what do you have to offer on immigration?&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex Castellanos, who was a consultant to Bush and to Mitt Romney, pointed to another potential wedge.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a hell of an issue on equal opportunity in education and school choice with Hispanic voters, with black voters, with suburban voters, with soccer moms,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are two beautiful kids in Washington whose parents chose the best school for them. Michelle and Barack Obama did the right thing  &mdash;  shouldn&rsquo;t you have equal opportunity to choose the best school for your kids, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>The central source of alarm among Hispanic Republicans, however, is the lack of any coherent appeal to Latinos as the midterm, then presidential, elections approach.</p>

			<p>This isn&rsquo;t hard.  Democrats are for big government, and will always be more pro-welfare than the Republicans, no matter how leftward the Republicans go.  Therefore, the Democrats will always win the Indoamerican vote.  They&rsquo;re just voting themselves gringo&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>More complicated than that, the late great Bard, Dr. Samuel T. Francis, formulated the &#8220;strong Republican weak Republican&#8221; thesis to explain why certain Republicans don&rsquo;t do well among Indoamerican voters.  He found that while the percentage of whites that vote Republican is always higher than the percentage of Latinos that vote Republican, there is a mirror trend election-over-election (Presidential ones).  If whites vote more R in an election compared to four years ago, Hispanics will so sway.  And vice-versa.  (Though never a majority.)  Bob Dole and John McCain were weak Republicans.  IIRC, Sam said that somewhere between 27 and 30 percent of the Hispanic vote for the Republican is the line of demarcation.  If the Republican gets more than that, s/he wins.  If below, s/he loses, but not thanks to the Hispanic votes, thanks to the white votes (or lack thereof).</p>

			<p>Oh I see, lower standards to get a lower standard of people on board. Create more divisions within the party so the outcome is similar to the Democrat&rsquo;s party of special interests, which are only now beginning to cannibalize itself because of certain backtracking and infighting from their own party.</p>
<p>If the individual pursuit of life, liberty, and the ol&rsquo; pursuit of happiness cannot deliver you to some extant of conservative values, then the Republican party SHOULD do without them.</p>

			<p>This article is full of canards.  Bush did not get 44% of the Hispanic vote.  The GOP lost support from all ethnic groups compared to 2004; Hispanics were just following the same trend that whites and everyone else was.  Losing Hispanic voters did not cause the Republicans to lose the election.  It also fails to mention that the GOP ran an openly pro-amnesty for illegal aliens candidate and he lost.  </p>

The GOP appears doomed for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>Their &#8216;Hispanic Strategy&rsquo; is based on a tenuous belief that catering to hispanics will produce hispanic GOP converts. We all know that&rsquo;s not going to happen, ever.</p>
<p>Their refusal to take up the immigration issue. If they don&rsquo;t want to deport illegals, the least they can do is insist that our laws are upheld. Enforcing employment practices that require legal immigration status verification is a no brainer. It&rsquo;s already on the book. No new laws have to be proposed or written.</p>
<p>Their obsession with &#8216;trickle down&rsquo; business models. While I&rsquo;m not anti-business, the GOP seems to believe that every nod and concession they give to business automatically translates into a GOP vote by virtue that helping businesses translates into jobs for American workers. Again, we know that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Too many businesses are getting something and giving nothing back to the average worker. You can&rsquo;t build a middle class if all you keep doing is giving businesses tax cuts while workers struggle with stagnant or shrinking wages.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Hispanics&#8221; are not conservative and never have been!  They want only affirmative action and freebies including taxpayer-funded government &#8220;jobs&#8221;. This big tent theory and all-inclusiveness is killing the Republican Party and they KNOW it!  Get rid of Michael Steele as he is one of those affirmative action hires by the GOP! For once, quit kowtowing to minorities and maybe the Republican Party can gain some respect for once. Nobody likes a panderer and appeaser!</p>

<p>Wrong Comrade Bonilla!</p>
<p>In fact, in Newspeak language that even you might understand, that is Double Plus Wrong!!!</p>
<p>In both 2008 and 2000, the Republicans failed to reach out to the white majority of this country, and build a galvanized sense of solidarity with them or even to encourage them to accept the reality that they might have non-multicultural agenda in common, that electoral politics could enforce if triumphant. Moreover, the white majority of the electorate dropped from 77% in 2004 to 74% in 2008, more due to white apathy and/or disgust with Comrade McCain, then to any significant increase in Hispanic voter participation; please, from 6% to 7.4% is hardly an Aztlan tsunami of barrio bravado. </p>
<p>The biggest mistake the Republican party has made and continues to make, is to embrace the genocidally anti-white concept of diversity worship. Individualism, self-reliance, limited government, minimal taxation, freedom of speech, and the right to keep and bear arms, may be what is the ideological moorings of the Republican Party; however, only one voting group shares that philosophical base with them overwhelmingly, that is the white majority of the United States. Every erosion of that majority, is a nail in that political pachyderm&rsquo;s coffin. </p>
<p>If and only if, the Republicans both realize this and act upon it, will they survive as a viable political force!!!!</p>

			<p>Republicans are generally girly men and women.  But they generally are about 100 times more manly or womanly than the other sick alternative (Democrats).  If the Republicans want to win racial votes, they simply need to speak truth to all issues.  I believe in the end that the truth still counts.  I&rsquo;m not anti-hispanic just because Latin Americans need to have fewer children and stay in their homelands.  I say the same for africans, asians, or even most Caucasians and others.  Stay in your homelands and we&rsquo;ll work together in mutual respect to help each other exist.  Since hispanics have raped our immigration laws and Americans have sold out their own citizens and responsibilities to uphold our nation, I&rsquo;m sure they can put theirselves in our shoes and understand why we don&rsquo;t trust them or each other.</p>

			<p>The reality is that the Republican party is, in effect, a loose anti-Democratic Party coalition. Around 1960, the Republican party abandoned its traditional positions: Strong central government as opposed to &#8220;states rights&#8221;, opposition to governmental racial discrimination, and reluctance toward foreign involvement. Thus the Democrats became the party of principle, and the Republicans a party without an ideological foundation.</p>
<p>The strategy of the Republican party has become to observe the Democratic party, and try to position itself to gain enough votes to win elections. This usually involves pandering to groups without accomplishing anything. For example, the Republicans bloviated about &#8220;states rights&#8221; to pick up the Southern White voters who felt betrayed by the Democrats. Talk was all the Southern Whites got. </p>
<p>The anti-Abortion crowd is handled the same. They got two pointless crumbs: prohibition on use of aborted feti for medical and scientific research (instead the feti are flushed down the toilet or sold to Asian restaurants), prohibition on U.S. money going to international organizations that fund abortions. The Republicans also give a vague commitment to provide SCOTUS judges that value human life. Note that while the Republicans controlled Congress for 11 years between 1995 and 2006, they made no attempt at a constitutional solution by amending the U.S. constitution, which is the only effective way overturn the pro-abortion decisions of the SCOTUS. </p>
<p>I think that this strategy has become ineffective. The Democrats stand for Liberalism, which (love it or hate it) is something. The Republicans stand for nothing, and non-Liberal Americans are starting to realize it. I am amazed that the Republican party continues to exist. Perhaps, non-Liberals think that they have no other party to vote for. A conspiracy theory type might believe that the Democrats are secretly keeping the Republican party alive to prevent effective opposition parties from forming. </p>

<p>Urgent, Mr Bonilla? What is so urgent about adding even more marginal members to a party when they don&rsquo;t share any of its values? Or worse, when they reject those values? All you get out of that plan is more Rino&rsquo;s and turncoats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Republicans need to be much more welcoming, less incendiary and much more thoughtful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is already open and welcoming. Much more so than the &#8216;welcoming diversity&rsquo; expressed by the congressional black and hispanic caucus, or the truly incendiary and thoughtless folks at LaRaza and ACORN.</p>
<p>&#8220;Navarro pointed to immigration as a central issue on which Republicans must change their tone and could steal a step from Obama, who has not clearly signaled whether he&rsquo;ll fulfill a campaign promise to press for immigration reform in his first year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t he just come out and say what he means&hellip;NO BORDERS and AMNESTY. Navarro, a republican fund raiser, seems to think republicans must change their platform and become more like socialists in order to lure hispanics. Wrong. Because republicans will never be able to out-pander democrats and amnesty is rejected by the republican platform. With the exception of the personal platforms of &hellip;.   </p>
<p>McCain, Grahamnesty, Bonilla, Navarro, Guerra, Castellanos&hellip;I see a trend here.  So just how did they all get that R behind their names, and which party, which country, and whose citizens are they really working for? <br>

			<p>Further to my earlier post. I think white Americans would welcome a party representing their interests, if such a party were put together like the BNP and wasn&rsquo;t an in-your-face screaming organization, but just a quiet this is who we are, this is what we believe and this is who we represent.</p>
<p>We have to get past this race doesn&rsquo;t matter nonsense and understand that it does matter and that the different races do have different interests. Indeed, it seems that whites are the only ones who don&rsquo;t know this.</p>

<p>Everyone is wrong about the Dem party winning because of hispanics! Hispanics, when there are enough of them, will vote OUT the old White race traitors and as soon as they can, they (the hispanics) will piecemeal elect totally Hispanic Senators, Congressmen, state and local government officials. Then the Kennedys and the like can join us at the bottom of the temporary food chain.</p>

<p>I have a theory why the Hispanic ones are nominal Republicans.  It might not fit perfectly, but it might be a good enough explanation.</p>
<p>Most blacks that are Republicans don&rsquo;t necessarily agree with the mainstream of Republican ideas, but they go to that party because most blacks are Democrat, and if you are a black and join a Democrat Party structure, you are going to have to wait in line for a lot of years and &#8220;pay a lot of dues&#8221; before you become somebody important and famous.  Since there are hardly any black Republicans, and since the Republican Party officially want them badly, you almost instantly become important and famous if you&rsquo;re black and set foot into a Republican Party office.  Feign or fake a little conservatism, and you&rsquo;re set for life.  That explains Michael Steele a lot, IMHO.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The Republican Party has scarcely begun to repair a wound that threatens to confine it to minority status: its 2006 collapse among Hispanic voters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Republicans lost Congress and the presidency both, because they rejected their hard core conservative base by pandering to non-whites.  </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting advised from the likes of liberals in the Republican party like Spector and the neocons advising McCain.  Now, there&rsquo;s an obviously childish effort being pushed by the likes of Colin Powell and McCain&rsquo;s empty-headed, pudgy daughter to make the Republicans even more like the Democrats.</p>
<p>And the radical leftist Democrats are very transparently trying to convince the country that Republicans can&rsquo;t win ever again, because they&rsquo;re too far to the right.  Quite hilarious.</p>
<p>The Republicans lost Congress, because Bush intensely pushed to give amnesty to illegals, and because he started a war that should never have been fought.  Social conservatives left him in droves, and millions stayed home and refused to vote, as they did when grandpa McCain ran. </p>
<p>It was Bush alienating his consevative base that lost so much for the Republicans.</p>
<p>All the Republicans have to do to win is to get the 10 to 12 million hard core 2nd amendment people and the social conservatives to go to the polls, and it will overwhelm the pitifully small number of mestizos who vote. </p>
<p>But, they won&rsquo;t do that.  Instead they try to straddle the fence in an effort to please non-whites who have no intention of voting for anyone who doesn&rsquo;t vote for policies that will give them something for nothing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s all going to turn out, because I think the country is now dysfunctional and will soon be in a deep, deep depression, the greatest depression the world has ever known, which will affect the entire world, but the US will forever be relegated to third world status pretty soon.  No longer will it be able to afford to meddle in the affairs of other countries and hand out our tax dollars to them in foreign aid, while having a power-monger in office that acts as the world&rsquo;s cop and unilaterally starts wars that causes great economic hardship and a loss of innocent lives.</p>
<p>If civil war isn&rsquo;t the result of all of this in many places throughout the world, then this entire degenerating downward economic spiral is going to create havoc and poverty on a scale never before seen.</p>

			<p>The GOP&rsquo;s only hope is to accept the fact that it is essentially a white party and start addressing the needs of white America.  This past election should be a wake up call to the GOP.  If you run a pro-amnesty hack like McCain and he loses the Hispanic vote big-time to a black man, you know you&rsquo;ve got a problem.<br>
I was surprised to hear Rush Limbaugh mention this issue last week on his radio show and even more surprised that he admitted that Hispanics will never vote GOP because the GOP doesn&rsquo;t offer enough handouts.  You can try all you want, but you are never going to be able to convince a Mexican making minimum wage and with little education that he should give up his generous social services and embrace free market principles.  Sadly, most on the mainstream right don&rsquo;t seem to understand this.</p>

			<p>The Democrats are openly saying that whites a/k/a &#8220;people who look like you&#8221; are a declining and &#8220;old&#8221; demographic. The Democrats are basically saying &#8220;whitey, your day is over.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Republicans a/k/a Greedocrats don&rsquo;t know what to do. They have supported open borders for a long time now, and yes the Republican ranks are filled with a certain type of jack ass in a business suit. Even the older Republicans have been trained in the 1960&rsquo;s Marxist multicult, so their ideas about what &#8220;conservative&#8221; is are completely skewed. </p>
<p>There is writing on the walls already, folks. This economy is in real trouble, and the Greedocrats never saw it coming because they were too busy drinking their own high priced Wall Street kool aid and don&rsquo;t know how to function without it. </p>

			<p>Here is a thought Republicans. Maybe people became anti-hispanic because you and the Democrats helped create that air of animosity. Let&rsquo;s see, in state tuition for illegals, free health care for illegals, get out of jail free for illegals, hell, illegal was almost better then being born here.</p>
<p>If the republicans while in power set equal standards for all people meaning, ILLEGAL IS ILLEGAL, I do not think Republicans would be facing such discontent from the hispanic community. </p>
<p>They could have offered a helping hand to naturalized and legal hispanic residents while condemning ALL ILLEGAL immigrants, hispanic or not. That opportunity is waning for any one party to accomplish solely, it has to be done in solidarity now by democrats and republicans.</p>
<p>The republican party created this monster, the people warned them, the just did not listen. The Republicans chose corruption over righteousness and are now paying the price.</p>

			<p>That Latinos are mainly welfare parasites hanging on the taxpayers for welfare supplements, food stamps, free healthcare, etc., is a historic reality. Democrats love getting people hooked on dependency (government hand-outs). Because it gives the Dems the perfect hold on minorities. &#8220;Look what we&rsquo;ve done for you&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Pandering notwithstanding, the Repubs lost the Latino vote. But arguably, they lost many more White voters&hellip; thanks to the Republican Party&rsquo;s utter stupidity in having McCain and Palin as the front-runners. McCain was seen far and wide as a bumbing, fumbling geriatric clone of G.W.B&rsquo;s useless wars and failed policies. Palin was literally a joke. Incapable of answering even basic questions. Thus the idea of her &#8220;a heartbeat away&#8221; from the presidency was enough to repell many voters.</p>
<p>The Republicans, if they really want to win, had better start LISTENING to what the majority of White Voters want and demand. We are still, after all, by far the majority in our own country.</p>
<p>We want a sealed border. An end to the amnesty nonsense. To reverse the flow, driving illegals BACK to where they came from. As a nation, we&rsquo;ve had our fill of parasitism, crime and endless social problems by illegal latino immigrants.</p>

<p>Is there any evidence to suggest otherwise?</p>
<p>The only way we will ever be able to get out of this wreck is for principled men and women to enter the contests for public office.  If enough people run for these offices we will manage to get some elected to gate keeper positions&hellip; they may be able to help others from this position.</p>
<p>Otherwise we stand alongside those two Slovakian soldiers and the two German soldiers on a short cliff at the bank of the Hrone River with the Soviets less than a quarter mile behind&hellip; The river is very cold with ice floating in it.  No possibility of carrying any weapons during the swim&hellip; the sound of enemy gunfire is getting louder&hellip; and there is only one small bottle of whiskey between them to provide the energy needed to make the February swim.</p>

<p>LEGAL non-white immigrants-this includes the hispanic variety-are as much of a threat to Native Born White Americans as the illegal ones. They are politically organized their racial interests. when they vote -the LEGAL ones-they vote for more of their own kind to come to America. And in te process make Native Born White Americans an ever dwindling racial minoriy.</p>
<p>You have spent way too much time watching race replacement enthusiasts Lou Dobbs.</p>
<p>LEGAL IMMIGRANTS steal. jobs and depres the wages of Native Born White Americans. Thousands of Native Born White Americans have already been greatly harmed by LEGAL IMMIGRANT asians.</p>
<p>This s a White Nationlaist website. White Nationlaists strongly oppose the race replacement of Native Born White Americans at the hands of LEGAL IMMIGRANT hispanics,asians,muslims,carribeans and africans.</p>
<p>I cringe every time someone comes on this web sites and writes something along the lines:ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BAD;Legal immigrants good. Both are bad. Non-white illegal immigrants are a powefull political force that votes for the race-replacment of Native Born White Americans at election time.</p>
<p>The cubans came in legally. And now, miami is a spanish speaking foreign city completetly hostile to Native Born White Americans. </p>
<p>How many LEGAL immigrant mslims do you want to be serving in a nuclear submarine. Would you like a submarine commaer named Mohammad? Your the kind of fool they will go put and vote for race replacement enthusiast and memeber of the hindu fifth column Bobby Jindal for president.</p>

			<p>As has been said, Republicans will NEVER have the support of a majority of &#8220;people of color&#8221;.  So, instead of seeing to it that America remain a nation that is majority white - while they still had a chance - they aided and abetted the Democrats in transforming this country demographically.  Once the demographic shift was set in motion, the fate of the Republican Party was sealed.  Now, pathetically, they&rsquo;re worried about selling their party to as many people as possible without any concern for core values.  In doing so, they&rsquo;re revealing their true motive: power.  They have no core values.  All they care about is having power.  The Republican Party has no concern for white people so white people should have no concern for it.  Let it die, I say.</p>

			<p>A black man who is very anti communist was talking to me about our local university and how it is totally marxist.  I told him that the university also advocates the extermination of Whites.<br>
He replied &#8220;that figures&#8221;  Then he said &#8220;The communists want to destroy the culture.  They can&rsquo;t destroy the culture until they destroy the Whites.  That&rsquo;s why the liberals have gone after Whites so much.  They can&rsquo;t finish their plan until the Whites are gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that sums it all up.</p>

<p>Considering the fact that after nearly a decade the Marines haven&rsquo;t been able to pacify a handful of third world insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan, they certainly pose no threat to armed Americans.

			<p>Anyone who speaks of how the GOP &#8220;lost&#8221; the Hispanic vote in 2008 is either ignorant or a liar. If a liar, then he is actually lying in several ways:</p>
<p>1) The GOP never &#8220;won&#8221; the Hispanic vote. Yes, it&rsquo;s percentage fell. But even the supposed Bush high of 44% was <i>still a loss</i>! The GOP has never won the Hispanic vote, at least not as a conservative party. And if it has to win them as a non-conservative party then why the hell bother? Politics is about ideas!</p>
<p>2) The GOP&rsquo;s nominee was far more directly connected to support for amnesty than Obama. Obama sat back during the 2006 and 2007 amnesty pushes and didn&rsquo;t utter a peep. John McCain was front and center every night on the news, vilifying racist Republicans and telling a fellow Republican senator to &#8220;f  &mdash;  - off.&#8221; Yet McCain chose not to mention his amnesty support during the election. I wonder why.</p>
<p>3) The GOP lost voting share among almost every demographic group: men, women, whites, blacks, asians, hispanics, well-educated, poorly-educated, middle class, married and unmarried - you name it, the GOP&rsquo;s share of the vote fell. Check CNN&rsquo;s exit polling data for <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#USP00p1" rel="nofollow">2008</a> and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html" rel="nofollow">2004</a>.</p>

			<p>Anonymous at 8:20 - very well said.</p>
<p>The GOP made this mess. To the extent that the conservative Republican opposition to amnesty turned off Hispanics the GOP has mostly itself to blame. It was Bill Kristol who called Republican amnesty opponents &#8220;yahoos.&#8221; It was Lindsey Graham, speaking to the racist La Raza, who called amnesty opponents bigots. And I won&rsquo;t even get into the names used almost daily by my supposedly &#8220;conservative&#8221; local newspaper against amnesty opponents.</p>
<p>Open borders Republicans spent the last 5 years calling their opponents in the GOP nativists, racists and xenophobes, rather than respectfully disagreeing with us, and yet they blame us for the loss of the so-called Hispanic vote which, as I already pointed out, WE HAVE NEVER, EVER WON!</p>

			<p>I am one of a few White Men left in what use to be a German and Polish neighborhood.  I now live in a large Hispanic community near Denver. Now it is about 90% Hispanics. Nearly all my Hispanic neighbors had John McCain signs on their lawns during the election.  At least in my town, most of the Republicans here are Hispanic!  During the Presidential Election, I attended most of the local Republican Election Headquarters and there were only 20 white people and about 80 Hispanics at these meetings.  The people that did have signs for Obama were the Whites!   The Republican Party does not have to worry about loosing the Hispanic vote in Colorado.  Ironically, we lost the State to the Democrats on all levels.  These Republican Hispanics really worked hard for our party.  I actually commend them for their hard work.  </p>

			<p>Every one of the more taxes for schools, prisons, welfare and government expansion measures on the California ballot was voted down on Tuesday May 18.</p>
<p>The reason is that taxpayers are absolutely sick and tired of supporting millions of hispanics from birth to death in our state, as well as them taking every low and medium skill job and government job.</p>
<p>Every time one of those minority government workers was shown on an ad saying &#8220;please give us more money&#8221; it was a vote against more taxes and more welfare and governmnet jobs.</p>

<p>The problem with the Republican Party and their followers is that they have a set of false myths regarding what they stand for and fool the simple into going along by pretending to have &#8220;moral&#8221; stances on social issues, appeal to an &#8220;old time&#8221; sentimentality that is cynical at its heart. Republicans Reagan and Bush both created much larger governments than any Dem ever did.  The Republican Party is a political front for international capitalism.  This is why they came up with a Black man to be their figurehead.  It is frank populist commercialism, and pretty clumsy too.</p>
<p>Some Whites continue to imagine that the Republican party is their saviour.  But it will sell them out as it has under Reagan and Bush for its own survival.</p>
<p>I have no problem with a political party for Whites only.  But that party would have to socialist in that this would be neccessary to promote the revival of the White race.  What I object to is providing the Third Worlders with social services of all kinds while I and other Whites must struggle to live and pay our taxes.  I wouldn&rsquo;t mind helping a poorer White couple have a family and educated it - that would help all Whites.</p>
<p>We need to get over that 19th century idea of American Individualism.  This is the kind that said that if you can outrace the other guy and stake your flag in the ground, you win, and to hell with the other guy, he can die in a ditch. And it is the kind of resentment that stood between Northern Whites who had to struggle alone on their farms and suffer abuses in factories worse than any Southern Plantation had for the life of wealth and ease of Whites in the South (not so true).  But this is the fact of it, Whites fight Whites over the perception of economic and social disparity all created by the resentments that fostered our Civil War (slavery was simply the vehicle).  If we can figure out how to stop espousing attitudes of our Northern Puritan joy killer ancestors and our Southern elitist snobbery, we might realize that we must cooperate and help build a White community to rival the Black, Hispanic and Asian ones that see our disunity and are feeding on us.</p>

			<p>To paraphrase a Biblical reference&hellip;..</p>
<p>What does the Republican Party gain by outright surrender to the pro-illegal alien faction, compared to the much more massive loss of Anglo voters?</p>
<p>I hasten to point out that only HALF of the American Hispanics are in favor of amnesty for illegal aliens. They left Mexico for good reasons and they do not want Mexico to follow them to the USA.</p>
<p>I am completely sick and tired of those RINO Republicans that keep saying the GOP MUST become a cheap imitation of the Democratic Party in order to have any chance in the future elections. First of all, it would never work. Even Mexicans would never fall for such a disguise. Second, the base of the Republican Party would never sit still for it. If the party bosses insist on Hispandering, they will find themselves bosses of an empty room&hellip;..they will gain no Hispanic voters and they will lose what Anglo voters they have left. In my book&hellip;.THAT is suicide.</p>

<p>Good for him for recognizing that. Marxism doesn&rsquo;t respect any culture or race. The game is to play one race against another to weaken society as a whole. The Marxists don&rsquo;t really want Aztlan either: they want to use the threat of Aztlan to break down Anglo Saxon dominance. If the Hispanics ever get a breakaway or semi-autonomous Aztlan, Marxism will find a way to start chipping away at that (probably using blacks or Asians).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to recognize racial differences because it will help you see how blacks are being used to destroy white society, but that doesn&rsquo;t require a petty type of racial bickering. After all is said and done, who would begrudge blacks the same inherent right we have, to their own living space where they can be develop their own natural potentials? </p>

What would I want with a party that favors wealthy corporations over the average man.This is a party that despite being in power for fair spell of the last two decades, did not accomplish a reduction in illegal immigration. Now the illegal/legal hordes are goint to outvote us Americans. The corporations and their love of cheap labor guided the GOP and the big dud Bush jr.Here&rsquo;s a hint;In the Amer.

			<p>The Republican Party already is two parties, they just don&rsquo;t know it yet. The obvious if unlikely solution is for a new Conservative Party to be founded to absorb the permanently disenchanted traditional Republican majority, and leave the Rino leftovers behind. </p>
<p>People like McCain, Graham, and Michael Steele are just mindlessly weak pols gravitating toward whatever they think is the current trend in American politics. They gave up principles and convictions long ago. Such frauds should be cut loose to follow their anxieties and join like-minded unprincipled democrats. (In the case of McCain and Graham however, I think their home states will kick them out next time no matter what party they then pretend to be in).</p>

			<p>Gary, what do you mean if they start?  They&rsquo;ve been doing this since Bush was in office and he even sicced one of his lapdogs, Linda Chavez, to attack the conservative base. He also tried to use religion to manipulate us by holding prayer breakfasts to pray for us ignorant racists and our souls. He then met with Vincent Fox, the then President of Mexico, and declared that patriotic American citizens like the Minutemen who wanted to enforce our laws were bigots and vigilantes.   </p>
