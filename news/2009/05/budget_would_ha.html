<h1>Budget Would Halt Growth of Barrier on Mexican Border</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>St. Louis Today, May 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama&rsquo;s budget blueprint announced on Thursday canceled plans to extend the controversial barrier fence along the U.S.-Mexico border beyond the 670 miles already completed or planned, symbolically breaking with a much-heralded approach to border security advocated by then-President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>However, federal officials plan to start construction within weeks on a new &#8220;virtual fence&#8221; along the border. They say the &#8220;fence&#8221; could almost completely cover the nearly 2,000-mile frontier within five years.</p>
<p>The Obama administration&rsquo;s budget provides limited funds for roads, lights and so-called tactical infrastructure  &mdash;  but not a dime to extend the pedestrian fencing and vehicle barriers erected along roughly one-third of the nation&rsquo;s 1,947-mile border with Mexico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As for the virtual fence, the first permanent towers holding sensors, cameras and communications gear to detect drug smugglers and illegal immigrants will be built along 53 miles of Arizona&rsquo;s border with Mexico, said Mark Borkowski, a Customs and Border Protection official in charge of the program.</p>
<p>More towers, as much as 120 feet tall and spaced miles apart, will follow on the remaining 320 miles of the state&rsquo;s southern border. Virtual fencing then will go up in New Mexico, followed by California and most of Texas, said Borkowski, executive director of the Homeland Security Department&rsquo;s Secure Border Initiative program.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The plans follow a prototype virtual fence that federal officials and others found inadequate for the job, and Borkowski said improvement probably would be made to the final version after border agents began using it.</p>

			<p>Bush&rsquo;s virtual fence, was generally considered a colossal failure. Despite that, federal officials say they&rsquo;re ready to begin building a new &#8220;virtual fence&#8221; along the U.S.-Mexico border.  Unfortunately it isn&rsquo;t just the citizens of Mexico that use the border illegally, its also others down to the tip of South America and anyone else that flies south of our border and migrates illegally north. We honestly need to secure our all our borders just to protect the US. The US needs to eliminate automatic citizenship to any child born on US soil, regardless of the mother&rsquo;s status. If she isn&rsquo;t here legally, the child should not receive citizenship. This wiil put the anchor baby border hospitals out of business. Next up, enforce our current labor laws that prohibit employers from hiring undocumented workers. If both were implimented or enforced, the illegal migration would slow to a trickle. Perhaps then our efforts would be better spend helping Mexico develolp into a country that provides an economy to support their own citizens. &hellip; </p>
<p>The other part of this is that Obama wants to prove that he can secure the border first before granting amnesty to 30 million illegals.  It&rsquo;s not going to happen with a &#8220;virtual fence.&#8221; </p>

<p>i assume all those towers will have little blinky lights to alert low flying aircraft. that should make the border easy to find in the dark. what&rsquo;s next? a big neon sign with a flashing arrow?</p>

			<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, if a &#8220;vertual fence&#8221; works so well, why don&rsquo;t they have one around the White House!!</p>

			<p>Too bad we don&rsquo;t have virtual illegals coming across the border.</p>

			<p>The government can only purchase so many $500 hammers and $2,000 toilet seats from big business.  Politicians therefore must find alternative ways to transfer more taxpayer money to the corporations that contribute to their campaigns.  How do they do it?  Well, the virtual fence is just one example.  Virtual fences are virtually useless, and as such, won&rsquo;t slow down the massive movement of foreign wage-slaves.  However, they will fool some citizens into believing that the government is actually doing something about illegal immigration, while allowing the transfer of Billions of Dollars to favored military corporations   &mdash;   the same corporations where our politicians will be working after they leave &#8220;public service.&#8221;  It is a great system, and a change we can all believe in!</p>

			<p>I guess funding for environmentalists, bureaucrats, college professors, and community organizers will be good for the economy but funding to protect the border will not.</p>

			<p>I wonder what would happen if Americans contributed to a fund for building the fence.  I know I&rsquo;d donate.</p>
