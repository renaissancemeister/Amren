<h1>Economic Crisis Heightens Africa&rsquo;s Conflict Tensions: OECD</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, May 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The global economic crisis has heightened the risk that &#8220;tensions could explode&#8221; in Africa, where growth will be slashed this year because of recession in rich nations, the OECD warned Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are signs of increasing political tension that cannot be ignored,&#8221; said a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), African Development Bank (AfDB) and UN Economic Commission for Africa which said the continent&rsquo;s growth would be cut to 2.8 percent this year after 5.7 percent in 2008.</p>
<p>Stressing that it was using &#8220;optimistic&#8221; estimates, it forecast a moderate 4.5 percent recovery in Gross Domestic Product in 2010.</p>
<p>&#8220;The situation remains tense in some countries and new tensions could explode in the coming months due to the worsening of economic conditions due to the global crisis,&#8221; said the report.</p>
<p>It highlighted widespread fallout from the crisis already seen in mass layoffs in the key mining sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although several governments managed the situation in 2008 by implementing support measures and containing social discontent, the situation is likely to be more challenging in 2009, in a context of reduced public resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commodity prices and demand from Western countries have collapsed in the crisis. The OECD said that while Asia remains a growing trading partner, particularly China and India, the demand was mainly for commodities and this has fallen off dramatically.</p>
<p>Four of the 52 countries surveyed will fall into negative growth: Angola, Africa&rsquo;s biggest oil exporter, could slump from 15.8 percent growth in 2008 to -7.2 percent this year. The Seychelles (-0.4 percent), Democratic Republic of Congo (-0.6 percent), Chad (-0.7 percent) were also predicted to fall into minus growth.</p>
<p>Central Africa will suffer worst from the crisis, with overall growth slashed to 0.2 percent, while East Africa should still see GDP rise by 5.5 percent.</p>
<p>South Africa, the continent&rsquo;s biggest economy, will see GDP growth fall from 3.1 percent in 2008 to 1.1 percent this year.</p>
<p>The OECD highlighted how a 3.3 billion dollar Nigerian-Chinese deal to build cement plants across Africa has been suspended. A nine billion dollar accord between China and DR Congo for mineral resources in exchange for infrastructure has also stalled.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rapidly rising current account deficits associated with the global recession is rapidly eroding international reserves, with African countries increasingly turning to the International Monetary Fund for support in order to avoid exchange rate crises.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several African countries have already seen food riots over the past 18 months and South Africa had deadly riots with &#8220;xenophobic connotations&#8221;, said the report which highlighted a new surge in military coups: in Mauritania and Guinea.</p>
<p>The army also intervened to help overthrow Madagascar&rsquo;s president this year, while the military in Guinea-Bissau killed President Joao Bernardo Vieira.</p>
<p>The OECD said the situation in Somalia was now &#8220;critical&#8221; with a civil war now in its 18th year. &#8220;The lack of an effective state threatens the security of the entire region,&#8221; said the report.</p>
<p>The report expressed concerns about events in Chad, where rebels staged a new offensive as the report was being released and how social protests had growing political impact.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Cameroon, protests against high prices were coupled with discontent over President Paul Biya&rsquo;s intention to modify the constitution in order to be allowed to run for a third mandate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Political economy considerations have acquired increasing relevance and the authorities have had to strike a careful balance between the need to take some measures to control unrest and the need to avoid a shift to authoritarianism,&#8221; said the report.</p>
<p>&#8220;With some exceptions, the stance taken by governments faced with these problems turned out to be constructive. The challenge will be to continue on this track, against a background of decreasing public resources, and uncertain donor support.&#8221;<br>

<p>THREATENS!!! THREATENS!!! hahahahhahaaa where are these writers from. And even if there were still White farmers in Africa producing plenty of food (as usual) the blacks would still be doing what black africans do to black africans in black africa, and of course in Detroit, N.O. ChiCONGO and such in the U.S.:)</p>

			<p>Africa&rsquo;s &#8220;economy&#8221; consists entirely of white tourism, mineral wealth extraction by white companies,white controlled agriculture exports and economic aid including food from white<br>
countries. When you subtract these sources from the economies of Arican countries you are left with an economic deficit, i.e. subsahara Africa produces Nothing other than a deficit to the world economy.</p>

			<p>I find it funny how the likes of MSNBC somehow miss articles like this each day on their website.  They are too focused on posting articles that involve white criminals day in and day out.  Is anybody else starting to get sick and tired of these news stories popping up everyday involving white people shooting each other somewhere?  Meanwhile 100 times as many blacks, hispanics, arabs, etc&hellip; are shooting each other somewhere else conveniently unnoticed by our &#8220;fair and balanced&#8221; news media in this country.</p>

			<p>So there might be violence and poverty in sub-Saharan Africa.  How can anyone tell?  It&rsquo;s like the Alabama song &#8220;Song of the South,&#8221; said, somebody told us Wall Street fell, but we were so poor that we couldn&rsquo;t tell.</p>

<p>The massive amounts of financial, food and medical aid from the U.S. is shared by all of them. An article in Nat Geo pointed out that the Sahara is encroaching @ 11KM a year into the African continent. When I was in school, and Geography was actually taught, the Sahara was a thin slice up in the North, NOW it encompasses a full third of the continent. Those people haven&rsquo;t begun to understand FAMINE yet, but they will soon.</p>

			<p>So what else is new,MSM won&rsquo;t report anything about this or any other problems in Africa.It would be cheaper for the west to give them guns and let them fight it out.The monkys in the trees has more brains than the monkys running the governments. </p>

			<p>Every black African country is a basket case. It&rsquo;s the same story with blacks all over the world (Haiti, Jamaica, Detroit, etc). The reason for this is the low level of black intelligence, but don&rsquo;t expect the MSM to talk about that.</p>

			<p>Apartheid, as practiced in the former South Africa was put in place to keep the various african tribes from slaughtering each other. Of course, those &#8220;do-gooders&#8221; in the west abhorred this system as being racist (even though it worked).  Even with apartheid in place, there was an influx of blacks INTO the country because there were JOBS and FOOD.  Compare that with the post-apartheid era (now).  Can ANYONE admit that under black (majority?) rule that blacks and the few brave remaining whites (Afrikaners) are better off?  The political situation speaks for itself.</p>

			<p>A large part of why the Sahara is advancing southward at 11 km per year is the insistance on the part of the locals on raising goats.  When it comes to destructive overgrazing on already marginal land, goats are absolute tops; they even have sheep beat on this score.  Africans aren&rsquo;t even very ecologically-conscious when it comes to offshore fishing.  They take huge amounts of bycatch and simply throw it away, so some coastal areas have been essentially fished-out.</p>
<p>Part of the anticipated economic crisis for Africa is due to the overall global economic contraction.  With lessened demand for products from the manufacturing contries, there is less demand for the raw materials Africa exports.  That was bound to happen no matter how well or incompetantly the area is run.</p>

<p>Your question, rephrased &#8220;Jeopardy&#8221; style, would be something on this order:</p>
<p>Answer: These people are responsible for starvation, AIDS and crime in Africa&#8221;.</p>
<p>Question: Who are Bantus?</p>

			<p>I find it somewhat ludicrous that only four out of 52 African nations will experience negative economic growth rates. They don&rsquo;t even mention Zimbabwe. I think Bantu Africa&rsquo;s economic statistics are being sugar-coated to say the least.</p>
