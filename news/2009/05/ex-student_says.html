<h1>Ex-Student Says NJ Medical School Discriminated</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Geoff Mulvihill, AP, May 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A former student claims in a lawsuit that the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey discriminated against him for the way he described his background in classroom discussions on cultural diversity.</p>
<p>Paulo Serodio said that in 2006, he told a professor and classmates that he was &#8220;white, African, American,&#8221; which he says accurately reflects the fact that he was born in Mozambique but later became a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p>He said some classmates and staff members at New Jersey Medical School found it offensive that a Caucasian man would call himself &#8220;African-American&#8221; and that the fallout led to harassment and eventually his suspension from the school.</p>
<p>Serodio, who lives in Newark, said some school employees and students told him not to describe himself as &#8220;African-American.&#8221; In the aftermath of his comments, Serodio said, flyers were hung around the school mocking him, he was assaulted and his car was vandalized.</p>
<p>His lawyer, Gregg Zeff, said Serodio eventually was suspended for &#8220;conduct unbecoming&#8221; a student.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Serodio filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Newark on Monday. He is seeking damages from the university and several faculty members and administrators.</p>

			<p>So Americans who have never been to Africa, and who ancestors came from there maybe 300 years ago, refuse to let a man who was born and raised in Africa refer to his origin.  This is a mixture of ignorance and racial solidarity, and neither changes the fact that this man is an African American. </p>

			<p>So, our president claims he was born in America to one black parent and one white, making him a 50 % black american. Not even African.</p>
<p>This fellow is white, but born in Africa making him an African and now is an American Citizen, making him American. I do not see where he lied. He is a white African American. </p>
<p>Our president only wishes he could claim that much. Although maybe he could if we would just admit where he was really born.</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with this guy?  Like we say all the time on Amren, an African born in England does not make him English.  The same rule applies here.  The guy is probably a Spanish-American.<br>

			<p>&#8220;African-american&#8221; is and always has been a racial code phrase for &#8220;black.&#8221;  Everyone knows this, but when Whites like this unfortunate medical student make the shell game too obvious to ignore, he is offered as a sacrifice to the gods of Political Correctness, lest anyone else be tempted to notice that the emperor has no clothes.</p>

			<p>If an African or Mexican spends one day in the United States or Great Britain they are American or English, but as the left wing of the world define it, your family could have lived 20 generations in an African country or India or China and if your causasian you are a foreigner.</p>

Blacks make a big deal that anyone is free to define themselves any way they want. Again, this is an idea which only applies to them.</p>
<p>I hope Mr. Serodio can document his claims and that he wins a big settlement.</p>

<p>Obviously these people have never heard of &#8220;Berbers,&#8221; a Caucasian people who have been living on the continent of Africa since the last ice age.  </p>

<p>I have gotten into heated &#8220;discussions&#8221; with blacks on this very issue numerous times.  You cannot truly appreciate the cognitive deficiencies inherent in blacks until you try to impress upon them the fact Africa has always been a home to many races.</p>

			<p>This confusion is the result of academia and other Government leftist entities using Orwellian NEWSPEAK for the purpose of re engineering the  language for the purpose of re engineering our thoughts.</p>
<p>In more enlightened eras, one could identify members of a racial or ethnic group by the use of words. Now, the use of those words are banned because they are not politically correct. Precise words are banished in exchange for vague and nebulous language which can mean anything our manipulators choose it to mean, and that can be changed to meet their objective of the moment.</p>

			<p>Strange that many on the Left like to say that &#8220;Ultimately we&rsquo;re all immigrants from Africa&#8221; when they&rsquo;re arguing for mass third-world immigration into the West. That would even make George Washington and Elvis Presley &#8216;African&rsquo; too.</p>

			<p><i>The guy is probably a Spanish-American.</i></p>
<p>Considering that he&rsquo;s from Mozambique and the first/last names, I&rsquo;m betting that he&rsquo;s a &#8220;Portuguese-American&#8221;.</p>
<p><i>I have gotten into heated &ldquo;discussions&rdquo; with blacks on this very issue numerous times. You cannot truly appreciate the cognitive deficiencies inherent in blacks until you try to impress upon them the fact Africa has always been a home to many races.</i></p>
<p>You too?<br>
My favourite ones are those who claim that modern Berbers, light-skinned Libyans, Algerians, Moroccans and Mauretanians are the &#8220;descendants of white slaves&#8221; while modern Egyptians are &#8220;descendants of Arab invaders&#8221;, but will then say that West Africans, Bushmen and East Africans are - despite their varied appearances and other physical/genetic differences - &#8220;TRUE Africans&#8221;.</p>
<p>But then again, doesn&rsquo;t the MSM call Seal a &#8220;British&#8221; musician?</p>

			<p>If he was born in Mozambique, I suspect his family is of Portuguese stock. The Portuguese had been in both Mozambique and Angola for quite awhile. Should white South Africans not be allowed to refer to themselves as &#8220;African&#8221;? Sounds like he was abused by the NJ darlings to me. </p>

			<p>And they are correct, by not allowing anybody but a black person to call themselves African-American. That Identity (Nation) is racially exclusive. All nations are racially exclusive; there is no such thing as a black German or black Englishman or even Pakistani Englishman.</p>
<p>Race is a non-divisible part or your nationality, I live in Africa and are part of the Boer nation and we are all white, we will not in a thousand years except a black person to call himself a Boer. Like I tell Europeans so often, there are no tribes in Africa only nations, the countries we live in in Africa need to be broken up so the nations can live. The African-American nation are allowed there racial exclusivity why are the Wasp nation and so many others not allowed to have racial exclusivity?????</p>

			<p>What exactly is  &ldquo;conduct unbecoming&rdquo; a student?  Perhaps they should just say what they really mean, i.e. &#8220;attempting to share in the racial spoils system&#8221; by a student.  As the first poster rightly pointed out, it is difficult to understand exactly how this individual is not &#8220;African&#8221; American at the same time that millions of blacks are apparently &#8220;accurately&#8221; described as such.  The typical &#8220;African American&#8221; black lacks even one of the following geraral critera for being described as &#8220;from&#8221; place X:</p>
<p>i. Born in X<br>
ii. Speak the predominant language of X<br>
iii. Personally know some individuals who can be unambiguously describable as being &#8220;from X.</p>
<p>None of these criteria apply to most black Americans but at least #i and possibly both ii and iii apply to the white medical student.</p>

			<p>Race is the principal siege gun used against those of European descent.</p>
<p>The designation &#8220;African American&#8221; serves two purposes; the first being the race of the person so described, the second relating only to the geographical area the racial African resides in.</p>
<p>An &#8220;American&#8221; has no race, and is indeed denied a race, thereby killing off any idea of racial consciousness, which in turn kills off the first and foremost means of resistance to the slow motion white genocide occurring across the Western world.</p>
<p>We whiteys made up 25% of the world population in 1950, and racially controlled our own territories with 90-100% white stock.</p>
<p>By 2050 we are set to be a mere 5% of the world population, and will be minorities in our own territories.</p>
<p>Liberals assume this will be hunky-dory. I hope they are right or their grandchildren may have cause to harbour no little resentment.</p>
<p>History and current global unrest points toward this liberal assumption being 100% wrong.</p>
<p>Will we survive this century, indeed half century, without an overturning of all that is currently promoted and accepted as normalcy? </p>

			<p>When I was in college at Mega State U. many years ago, I recall seeing a group of White South Africans in a bar, and they were all wearing &#8220;African Student Union&#8221; t-shirts. One of our group knew one of the &#8220;African&#8221; fellas and we ended up hanging out with them.  Turns out that one of the White South Africans was the PRESIDENT of the campus African Student Union.  That, to me, spoke volumes about how differently native Africans and American-born Africans view Whites.  It seems that those black native African students knew that they needed the White South African chap to lead and organize their club, if it was to be successful.</p>

<p>They can always do the next best thing. Denounce &#8216;racists&rsquo; who identify with being white. Say it enough, about working-class white folks usually, and you can almost be accepted. In fact, I&rsquo;d say denounce them enough, and you can rise above the negative association, even to above the guilt, to above an even zero maybe. Not bad for white folks. </p>

			<p>Just  lots  of confusion above. Given the  fact  that  Africans  like the  cheetah and  the  African elephant are  the  evolutionary product  of the  African environment  then  it&rsquo;s  perfectly  logical to  argue  that  individuals  who  just  happen  to  be  born  in the  environment  we  now  call  Africa should  be  called  African.</p>
<p>There  is  indeed a  logical and  scientific  basis to call Africans  &mdash;  i.e. those  individuals whose  genotypes and  phenotypes point to an  African origin  &mdash;  well, just  Africans.</p>
<p>Thus  individuals  whose phenotypes and  genotypes show  Europe are  Europeans  &mdash;  even if  born in Africa, and  even their  forbears  have  lived  there for 200  years  or  so. What is  200  years  compared  to  200,000  years  and  even  before  that.  In that  regard, designated  African Americans  who bear  Africa&rsquo;s genotypes and  phenotypes are  indeed African. </p>
<p>Another  error posteres  above make  is  that  they  confuse a  continent  with  a  nation.  An  European  born in South Africa is  &#8220;South African&#8221;  by nationality  but  he/she is  not  &#8220;African&#8221;. Get  it?</p>
<p>My  points  are  also  backed  by  the recent  large  genetic  studies  done  in Africa  by  geneticist  Sarah Tishkoff and  team.</p>

<p>Using your logic then, most blacks here in America have no right to call themselves &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; for the simple fact they are a product of mingling the blood of African slaves with Whites and Amerindians.  They possess &#8220;genotypes and phenotypes&#8221; not peculiar to the African continent.</p>
