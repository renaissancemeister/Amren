			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Bogardus, The Hill, May 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A civil rights controversy surrounding several Indian tribes could pit President Obama against some of Capitol Hill&rsquo;s most prominent liberals and black lawmakers.</p>
<p>Reps. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), John Lewis (D-Ga.) and others asked Attorney General Eric Holder in a letter dated last Thursday to initiate a &#8220;full-scale investigation&#8221; of five Indian tribes for allegedly abusing the rights of the Freedmen: African-Americans descended from freed slaves once owned by Indians.</p>
<p>Also signing onto the letter were other senior lawmakers from the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), including Reps. Diane Watson (D-Calif.), Shelia Jackson Lee (D-Texas) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), the caucus&rsquo;s chairwoman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over forty years after enactment of the landmark Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts, there is a place in the United States that African Americans cannot vote or receive federal benefits as a matter of law,&#8221; the letter states. &#8220;The victims of this racial oppression are known as freedmen, who are descendants of African slaves owned by Indians. They are called freedmen, but they are anything but free.&#8221;</p>
<p>The call for an aggressive investigation of the tribes by Congress could force Obama to contradict a position he took on the campaign trail last year.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2008, the then-Illinois senator helped solidify his Native American support by arguing against Washington intervening in a dispute involving a group of Freedmen and the leaders of the Cherokee Nation. The Freedmen had been expelled from the tribe after it amended its constitution in March 2007.</p>
<p>The CBC had begun targeting the Cherokee for that decision, pushing legislation to cut off public housing funding for the tribe.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reacting to the letter, representatives for the tribes said they have followed the law and have not abused the rights of anyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to have Creek blood to be a citizen of our nation. We do have a lot of black people who are members,&#8221; said Chief A.B. Ellis of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;This letter shows that, when it comes to the Cherokee Nation, its signatories do not care about the facts or what&rsquo;s happening in the federal courts. As the Cherokee Nation has explained to more than 100 members of Congress through meetings, this issue has never been about race but only about who is a citizen of an Indian nation,&#8221; said Mike Miller, a spokesman for the Cherokee.</p>
<p>Bill Anoatubby, governor of the Chickasaw Nation, also said his tribe had not discriminated against anyone. {snip}s</p>
<p>The lawmakers asked for an investigation into a group of tribes  &mdash;  known as the Five Civilized Tribes  &mdash;  that had good relations with settlers during colonial times but were forcibly relocated to Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Originally, the CBC had concentrated only on the Cherokee, since they recently amended their constitution to exclude the Freedmen. A court order has given the Freedmen temporary Cherokee citizenship as the dispute weaves its way through the federal courts.</p>
<p>At issue is how the rights of the Freedmen  &mdash;  estimated to number 100,000 to 150,000 among the five tribes  &mdash;  should be treated by Indian leaders.</p>
<p>The lawmakers have argued several tribes signed treaties with the federal government after the Civil War that would afford citizenship rights to the freed slaves. They would be treated as full members, earning the applicable benefits and being allowed to vote in tribal elections.</p>
<p>But Indian leaders have disagreed. Several have held elections to change their tribal constitutions to exclude the Freedmen. They believe any action from Washington would interfere with their tribal sovereignty and thus would be unjust.</p>

			<p>It seems to me that the DOJ and the Democrats would be better spending taxpayers money, investigating Jane Harmon, Dennis Hastert and Nancy Pelosi among hundreds of other of our elected &#8220;representatives&#8221;.</p>

			<p>This could be a bit of a sticky wicket for the libs. Not many people know about the fact that the noble red man owned black slaves like the hated White oppressors. They&rsquo;ve got to be careful here or people might start asking questions. You know how questions can be sometimes. One leading to another and all. It might even come out that free blacks here in America owned slaves. I bet the libs wouldn&rsquo;t want that bandied about too much either.</p>

<p>Bobby they will never do that because all high placed bureaucrats have something to hide. Blackmail is one of the ways they are kept under control by their masters.</p>

			<p>Had European American whites have only been a little wiser in the beginning to understand the whole slave entanglement boondoggle was nothing was a ripoff con from the gitgo from tibal chief cleaning house of his rejects to slave merchant hawking their African cargo on the auction block using some irrelevant younger brother curse from way back. <br>
Why didnt Europeans over the 1000s of yrs go to Africa and bring them there to build the great white nations and cities? Were the new elite westerners really this ignorant or were they just greedy in the choas expansion of the great advanced white civilization? <br>
Even after slavery was institutionalized these elite could have still rectified the problem by not releasing them cart blanche all willy nilly into white society as citizen equals as the north so stupidly did after the turn of the 19th century bastardizing the true meaning of Jeffersons Declaration of independence. Jefferson was referring strictly to white men created as equals and not other races since the issue at hand was only about the independence of the 13 colonies from the monarchy of England and certainly not about race. Jefferson was not pc.<br>
If the problem although was about race only then the early Americans would have easily used the reds to be their slaves as opposed to going to Africa although America only got about 5% of all African slaves with the other 95% going to other parts of the great western Euro expanion.  <br>
We know that obviously the black race was intentionally placed in the remote distant jungles in order to separate them from the other 2 more civilized races especially the superior supreme white Euro race and this held well until the discovery of the untamed west that was opportunistic for the new Euro slave dealers to pull their schemes off. <br>
We clearly understand the same neoconish elite mentality with the ignorant Bush comment to justify his allowing millions of illegals to break the law and cross the border saying &#8220;they do jobs noone else will do&#8221;. <br>
This one comment explains the one track idiot rationale of those elite who were tricked into buying into the slavery catastrophe and proves what an unfit unworthy incompetent moron ex-alcoholic silver spoon brat cut and run Nam dodger Lincolnite &#8220;bring it on&#8221; prodical who occupied the WH the past 8 yrs allowing the current mutt messiah to become the next president notwithstanding his intentional destruction of the South while it to his own advantage along with completely wasting the true conservative movement not the fictional one made of liberal elites from Yale or Harvard.</p>

<p>SOOOOOO TRUE, this blackmail threat is how the Saudis continue to trample us. The Saudis have the best Congress and Senate that money can buy.</p>

			<p>Anonymous, white indentured servants and red slaves both got sick and died or deserted in the unhealthy heat and humidity of the old south. That was before air conditioners and medicines to treat malaria and yellow fever. Blacks could work and survive better in the heat, so they grew in numbers because their labor was in demand. </p>

			<p>Just what exactly how those claimed rights purportedly abused&hellip; and HOW or what abuse is being conducted? I mean Blacks, Indians or mixed-Black and Indian people have the same legal rights everyone else does. So how is this right to vote or right to receive federal benefits being withheld from them?</p>
<p>Seems we&rsquo;re getting accusations but no substantiative evidence or details.</p>

<p>We should have left them in Africa and done the work ourselves. The blacks in Africa never figured out 2 story dwellings or the wheel by themselves, so there is no reason to suppose they would have figured out sea travel and celestial navigation either.</p>

			<p>i agree. Whites invented algebra (al-jabr) and algorithms (al-khwarizmi).</p>
<p>Whites also invented chemistry (al-qemi), and also Arabic numerals.</p>

<p>I think it is the right to vote in Tribal elections for Tribal officials.  </p>
<p>The benefits are what is known as Indian Money, a federal check sent out to Indian Tribal members as an eternal payment for the lands taken from the Indians at various times.</p>
<p>Other benefits are actually Tribal benefits such as enrollment in HMO&rsquo;s, the right to live in tribal housing and other Tribal benefits funded by the federal government.</p>
<p>In effect, the Freedmen have been bounced out of the Cherokee Nation and are just like the rest of us.</p>

<p>ARABIC NUMERALS!! Why are numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 called ARABIC numerals, the Arabs don&rsquo;t use them except for translation of documents so English speakers can tell they are numbers.</p>
