<h1>An Open Letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frank Ellis, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> May 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<blockquote>
<i>[Editor&rsquo;s Note: Over the weekend, Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, and John Sentamu, the Ugandan-born Archbishop of York, the two most senior clerics in the Church of England, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8065583.stm" target="boycott" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>urged voters not to support the British National Party</b></a>at the polls on June 4. Dr. Frank Ellis, a former professor of Russian and Slavonic Studies at the University of Leeds and a speaker at the 2000 American Renaissance conference, responds.]</i>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Dr. Williams:</p>
<p>I am writing to you to protest about your recent remarks in which you advised electors not to vote for the British National Party (BNP) in the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament.</p>
<p>The BNP is a properly constituted and law-abiding political party registered with the Electoral Commission of the United Kingdom. The core programmes of the BNP are rational, wholesome, morally sound, and desirable. As such, and in the complete absence of any evidence to show that the BNP and its members are engaging in any unlawful activity whatsoever, I construe your advice to electors as direct and wholly unwarranted interference in the electoral process of the United Kingdom. Your statement was a clear ideological act  &mdash;  it had nothing to do with Christ&rsquo;s teaching  &mdash;  in which you sought to exploit your position as head of the Church of England in order to undermine a political party engaging in proper and lawful activity.</p>
<p>The grotesque and by now well-documented <b>abuses of expenses perpetrated by Members of Parliament</b> are, in fact, directly linked to the mass invasion of this country by legal and illegal immigrants and the vicious, anti-white, racist ideology of multiculturalism. Can politicians who have so relentlessly and consistently plundered the public purse over so many years and who have writhed and prevaricated in an attempt to escape censure when their porcine greed has been exposed in all its revolting ugliness be relied upon to tell the truth about the consequences for the United Kingdom of mass immigration? The answer is that far too many politicians are serial liars: and their lies are too obvious.</p>
<p>Politicians of the two main parties have endlessly lied about the consequences of mass immigration. Diversity is not a blessing: it is a curse. The racial, cultural, and physical dispossession of the white indigenous population of the United Kingdom is not something I intend to celebrate. It fills me with dread, loathing, and disgust: dread because I fear for the future of white people, <em>my people, my land</em>; loathing because of the way in which the prosperous, white, middle classes have betrayed their country; disgust because of the moral and intellectual cowardice of too many people who know perfectly well what is happening but stay silent. Public-sector agencies and all levels of our education system are full of such people.</p>
<p>Your view that the BNP&rsquo;s &#8220;core ideology is about sowing division in our communities and hostility on grounds of race, creed and colour&#8221; typifies the Goebbels-style propaganda and organised lying to which any person or political party that objects to multiculturalism is routinely subjected. I see no evidence that you  &mdash;  or for that matter the rather confused John Sentamu  &mdash;  have ever given any consideration to the possibility that multiculturalism, based as it is on sentimental, wilfully ignorant and blatantly ideological assumptions about the nature of race, culture, nations, and history, is itself the source of the anger, resentment, and division which blight so many parts of the United Kingdom. The white, indigenous population of this country bitterly resent the way in which they are made to feel second-class citizens in their own country. That anger and resentment are fully justified. People like you have helped to create this situation.</p>
<p>Like politicians, you have prevaricated, dissembled, and looked away from the truth rather than confront the ugly nature of multiculturalism head on. Whenever I hear the latest utterance from a Church of England official on some aspect of multiculturalism I ask myself whether this person serves Him or some secular body. I also smell the same sickly-sweet herbs that Pilate used to wash his hands. Moral cowardice is, of course, the real sin of the Church of England. Your Church actively ignores Biblical prohibitions against homosexuality and cravenly accepts the depraved lies of feminism with all the attendant misery and pain that have been inflicted on the institution of matrimony. How, then, can the Church of England be expected to tell the truth about multiculturalism when it has succumbed to the Satanic perversions of feminism, when it refuses to uphold Biblical teaching on heterosexual love and marriage?</p>
<p>In its desire to parade its left-liberal credentials, your Church has abandoned the nation and the Master it was called upon to serve. The Lord will deal with you in His own way and time. Meanwhile, you owe Mr Nick Griffin, the BNP, and the very large numbers of people who will cast a vote for them on 4th June 2009 an unreserved apology.</p>
<p>Dr Frank Ellis<br/>
Ampleforth, England<br/>
May 27, A.D. 2009</p>

		<p>Has the C of E caved in to accomodating the muslims in any of their schools? (Does the C of E have any schools?) BTW, I also agree with the letter and wonder why any White English citizen should GAF WHAT the treacherous C of E has to say about anything. JMO</p>

		<p>Good to see Mr Ellis is still alive and kicking. This seems a bit direct for Ellis, someone who truly seems to understand both Marx-Leninism and &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo; on a subtle and intricate basis, but it&rsquo;s nice just the same. I&rsquo;m actually surprised Mr Ellis is a BNP supporter - actually he doesn&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s a BNP member, but desperate times, and evil days, call for, no, demand, redress and desperate measures. </p>

		<p>I am so happy to see a Christian stand up to the political elements in church who think that embracing left-wing ideas will somehow win favor for the church, or will make their country a better place. This is not just a fight between the Anglican church and the British Nationalist Party. Left-wing pandering by church and denominational leaders is a battle in virtually every major denomination in Caucasian countries. Good job, Dr. Ellis.</p>

		<p>Skip wonders if the Church  of England has any schools, and if it has any Moslems in those schools.The answer in both cases is yes, the Church has many hundreds of schools and they are determinedly multi-racial, multi-cultural and multi-faith. There are many Church of England schools which have few, or no, white Christian children, the Church proclaiming - with its usual self satisfied smugness - that its schools are &#8220;denominational, not sectarian&#8221;. The madness which infects the Church has now reached its logical conclusion with a requirement for Church schools to turn away the children of practising members of the Church in order to ensure that &#8220;children of other faiths&#8221; always comprise at least 25% of the pupil numbers! All in the name of the false idol of &#8220;diversity&#8221;. </p>

		<p>MY LETTER TO THE BISHOPS<br/>
PLEASE DO NOT INTERFERE WITH PEOPLES&rsquo; HUMAN RIGHT TO VOTE.<br/>
PLS. VOTE FOR ENGLAND&rsquo;S BEST PARTY  &mdash;  THE BNP</p>
<p>Dear Bishops:</p>
<p>Please understand that England is a DEMOCRACY and the BNP is a legal political party that is running for elections.  People have an ABSOLUTE AND UNFETTERED right to vote for who they want.  I am sorry, but your poking your nose and telling people who they must vote for is inappropriate and insult the British People.  People have to decide for themselves who they want to vote for; not you.  </p>
<p>Regarding your criticism of the BNP, it is quite misplaced.  The BNP is the BEST policitical party.</p>
<p>You see, do you leave your doors open at night and let anybody and everybody come and do what they want.  You wear clothes (a border) and your house has borders (walls and doors).  The same way a nations needs borders and should not allow foreigners to come in. A person who walks around naked would be considered mentally deranged; a nation that aliens to invade it unfettered is a mentally ill nation.  The alien invasion has destroyed EU creating job shortages, unemployment, congestion and pollution.  Anyboy who supports their nation&rsquo;s destruction is a traitor and a sick evil barbarian. Civilization caused nations to form; destruction of national boundaries is regression to barbarianism.   </p>
<p>The BNP is the most patriotic party and the most civilized party England has.  As Bishops, I think you can show your culture and morals by condemning the alien invasion, demanding a ban of immigration and supporting the BNP.</p>
