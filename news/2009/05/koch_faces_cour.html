<h1>Koch Faces Court Date</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Harrell, Daily Tar Heel (University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill), May 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Senior Haley Koch, the only person to be arrested so far for last month&rsquo;s protest of former U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., has jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Koch said she will be keeping her Morehead-Cain scholarship after meeting with Morehead-Cain Foundation Director Chuck Lovelace to discuss what took place and her role in the April 14 protest.</p>
<p>Now, Koch faces a court date Monday after being arrested nine days after the protest for disturbing the peace.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the University&rsquo;s Department of Public Safety is in the middle of an internal review sparked by a formal complaint submitted by students.</p>
<p>Koch and the authors of the complaint have said that what was a peaceful demonstration was escalated by the police&rsquo;s use of pepper spray and pushing students down and grabbing them by the hair.</p>
<p>University police have said their use of pepper spray on students and the discharge of a Taser as a warning were necessitated by the rowdy nature of the protest, which culminated in a broken window in the Bingham Hall classroom where the speech was to be held.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Koch and another student stood with a banner in the front of the classroom where Tancredo had been invited to speak on immigration by the campus group Youth for Western Civilization, shouting over Tancredo so he was unable to speak.</p>
<p>Although he was unable to comment further on the protest investigation because it too is ongoing, Young [Randy Young, spokesman for DPS] added that further arrests of the more than 100 protestors are still possible.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Koch] said she expects at least a hundred students to be present at a protest outside the courthouse at noon Monday, including leaders of various campus organizations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>What did people expect? You didn&rsquo;t really think she&rsquo;d be punished? I&rsquo;m still waiting for her to receive a reward from the University for her vileness. All U.S. ivy league universities, and almost all others are controled by extreme left wing, multiculturalists, and globalitsts and Ms. Haley Koch and her ilk, are their poster children. What&rsquo;s a U.S. Congressman to these geniuses? Get real.</p>

		<p>It would be an invaluable contribution to the study of phschological warfare if this pitiful bigot could be examined extensively, including her entire background, to determine how a human can be turned so completely towards a particular point of view to the point where she rabidly defends everything about it in spite of the fact that it is against her own best interests.</p>
<p>How do people become kool-aid drinkers?  Why is it some are so gullible yet others receiving the same exact kind of mind control realize the foolishness of it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely important to know just what the causes for this cult phenomenon is.  If a society would ever elect to build from the ground up, so to speak, and select only those people who can think independently it would be very important to know. </p>
<p>I mean, that is, in case the people building a society want to avoid those types who think they are going to set up a colony on the moon any day now, because it has been hammered into their brains by obvious con artists who many other people can see are charletons.</p>

<p>In other words, as Ms Koch views this, she and her ilk are the rule and the law. What could her IQ be? According to this latest threat of hers:<br>
1) You can not speak unless &#8216;she&rsquo; approves<br>
2) &#8216;She&rsquo;, and by extension her mob will determine the validity of any court action.</p>
<p>Incredible hutzpah! for sure. </p>

		<p>I watched the video of what happened to Mr. Tancredo, as he tried to speak at the event regarding the current U.S. Immigration policy, as well as Illegal Immigration, and its danger to the Country. </p>
<p>The Communists and Anarchists were clearly agitating for a fight, outside the Hall, as well as yelling over Tom Tancredo, during his remarks. </p>
<p>It was the Leftist that caused a near riot in the Hall, and even more were waiting outisdee with banners, while screaming obscenities. </p>
<p>I am familiar with Youth for Western Civilization. Actually, they should coordinate with other Conservative Groups to meet the protests head-on. There is a Group called Protest Warrior which does just that. They protest the Protesters, shoving it right back into the Leftists&rsquo; faces, which is the only thing that those dirty, vulgar, gangs of Multiculturalists understand.</p>
<p>Actually, I am willing to bet that more members of the Football, Baseball, Hockey, and Lacrosse Teams are Conservative than Liberal. Not too many years ago, these very Athletes were used to impress upon Leftists, that if they wanted to keep their faces in one piece, they backed away from the &#8220;Violent Protests&#8221;. That, or they might be dangled by their ankles off the roof of a local Fraternity.</p>

		<p>Nothing will happen to this thing. Remember Nifong? Remember Pelosi? Liberals are not subject to the same laws as normal people. When they do something wrong, there is some talking about punishing them, but it never happens. Nothing ever happens to the liberal. He gets away with his crime and goes on to rise within the ranks of the democrat party.<br>

 If there was a family who could afford big time tuition, it&rsquo;s the Koch family. Given all the government complaints about how difficult affording college is, why wasn&rsquo;t this scholarship given to someone in need? <br>
 The answer is that Leftists are in the upper &#8220;caste&#8221; and deserve more because we in Schumer&rsquo;s &#8220;chattering class&#8221; aren&rsquo;t worth it. </p>

		<p>I have a daughter, and if she ever does anything like this, that will be the end of all parental support, and she will pay her own way through college.  We will also sit her down and explain that we do not have a daughter anymore.</p>
<p>I will never tolerate a Communist as a family member.</p>

		<p>I would not be the least bit surprises if  Morehead-Cain Foundation Director Chuck Lovelace  was of the very same mindset as Haley Koch.  i&rsquo;m sure they had a few laughs together at the meeting and Mr. Lovelace probably told Mrs. Koch to be more careful next time before she departed.</p>

		<p>No matter how this goes, either way, I don&rsquo;t see any good coming of it.</p>
<p>If she&rsquo;s acquitted, she&rsquo;ll be a hero (heroine? oops, that&rsquo;s sexist language).</p>
<p>If she&rsquo;s found guilty, then even worse, she&rsquo;ll be a martyr for the cause, and  she will be worshipped forever more. </p>
