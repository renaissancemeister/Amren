<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=98694">How Disease-Carrying Foreigners Endanger U.S.</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Erik Rush, WorldNetDaily, May 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In September of 1992, an Associated Press article entitled &#8220;On The Trail of Tapeworm&#8221; appeared in newspapers across America. It chronicled numerous occurrences of infections of Taenia solium, or the pork tapeworm, amongst members of orthodox Jewish communities in New York City. The syndrome given rise by the infection, called cysticercosis, is marked by brain lesions, seizures and other neurological manifestations, and ultimately death. The disorder is treatable but, unfortunately, extremely difficult to diagnose. The aforementioned brain lesions are caused by the tapeworm larvae themselves, which anchor themselves to blood vessels within the brain.</p>
<p>One of the questions that arose when the Centers for Disease Control finally became involved was this: How would such a parasite, which is contracted through the ingestion of improperly cooked, infected pork, insinuate itself into a population of individuals who are prohibited from eating pork?</p>
<p>{snip} Schantz [Dr. Peter Schantz, an authority on parasitic diseases at the CDC] had been involved in the initial diagnosis of an 18-year-old man in the western United States  &mdash;  also an orthodox Jew  &mdash;  with cysticercosis.</p>
<p>In the case of this young man, as well as all of the subsequent cases with which Schantz and others became familiar, the infections were traced to workers from Mexico and Central America that the orthodox Jewish families had employed. These had apparently become infected in their home countries  &mdash;  where standards of meat inspection and preparation fall below that of the U.S.  &mdash;  and passed the parasite on to the host families after using the toilet and failing to wash their hands.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} One might also think that a media firestorm would have ensued over foreign workers infecting Americans with brain worms via their own feces. That didn&rsquo;t happen either. Between government negligence, a squeamish press and the tendency of these workers toward transience, the infections spread, Dr. Schantz later explained, across the U.S., all the way to the East Coast.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is likely that H1N1 spread like wildfire throughout Mexico (where the first cases were reported) because of poor hygiene. Why might those in Mexico practice poor hygiene? Ignorance. Why might they be ignorant? An abysmal educational system. Why do they have an abysmal educational system? Because their government is corrupt to the core. It&rsquo;s one of the chief reasons people from Mexico and Central America come to the U.S. in the first place.</p>
<p>In my 2007 book, &#8220;Annexing Mexico: Solving the Border Problem Through Annexation and Assimilation,&#8221; I covered in-depth the emerging dilemma as regards illegal and poorly screened immigrants routinely carrying diseases  &mdash;  some of them life-threatening  &mdash;  into the U.S.</p>
<p>Some of these, such as Dengue fever, are truly horrific. This mosquito-borne illness (which is on the rise in Mexico), like the dreaded Ebola, causes fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, rashes, nausea, vomiting, internal bleeding and bloody diarrhea.</p>
<p>None of this is widely discussed in the establishment press, however, nor is it considered a major issue in predominant political circles. {snip}</p>

		<p>The MSM doesn&rsquo;t report the number of cases of Tuberculosis that have been transmitted to Americans by riding on buses, subways,<br>
and airplanes. Nor is leprosy forgotten now that migrants from Africa grace our shores. Any number of diseases are now diagnosed in our hospitals after not being seen for 75 years.<br>
And our health systems treats everyone of these diseases for freebies although the cost is shifted to your next health insurance bill.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It is likely that H1N1 spread like wildfire throughout Mexico (where the first cases were reported) because of poor hygiene.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mexico now has 1600 cases and the US has 2600 cases.  New infections in Mexico have stopped, but their still accelerating in the US.</p>
<p>Is this due to bad hygiene too? </p>
<p>Latin American countries closed their borders to anything coming from Mexico, but the brilliant messiah uttered his ultimate intelligent thoughts by claiming it was too late to close the borders (After the first week or two) because it was like closing the door after the horse left the barn.</p>
<p>HUH?  Does he mean it would be useless to prevent more infected cases from coming in?  Surely he&rsquo;s not that stupid is he?</p>
<p>And the US press must be just as stupid, because they never reported that the countries who DID close their borders at the time we should have now have but a wee amount, and we have a raging spread going on right now.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it so nice to have such an INTELLIGENT president?</p>

<p>So we get cheaper prices for our heads of lettuce, we help Pedro support his ailing grandmother in Guadalajara, and we get brain worm in return. Nice. I think I&rsquo;ll just pay extra for the lettuce, thank you. </p>
<blockquote>One might also think that a media firestorm would have ensued over foreign workers infecting Americans with brain worms via their own feces.
<p>The media cannot sell us the idea that third world immigration is in our best interest if we find out about Taenia solium, that&rsquo;s why.</p></blockquote>

		<p>A few months ago, at a local mall, i was using the mens bathroom when a male hispanic emerged from one of the toilets he had just used and walks towards the sinks to presummedly wash his hands with soap and water. He does&rsquo;nt wash his hands. To my horror, he instead soaks both of his hands with water and then proceeds to comb his hair with his hands. </p>
<p>I remember leaving the mall feeling a bit depressed. </p>

		<p>One day I was taking a walk around the neighborhood in which I live in a city in the state many lovingly call Taxifornia.  I walked past three young what appeared to be hispanic kids who were walking on the sidewalk in my direction probably from the school that is down the street.   Very shortly after I noticed on the ground in front of me a wiggling worm.  I looked closer and the way it was wiggling was odd to me.  It wasnt like an earthworm which is what I thought it was at first.  I looked closer and it was an ascaris worm.  I took zoology back in college and learned a lot among the numerous things we learned one was a short stent with parasitology.  Ascaris are known as round worms in contrast to earthworms which are segmented worms and you can get ascaris worms primarily through eating infected pork. It is common knowledge among those familiar with parasitology that in third world countries these worms commonly fall out of childrens pantlegs, very often of course this happens in schools where there is a concentration of children.  Diversity doesn&rsquo;t just include mixing white/caucasian anti-communist resistance out of existance through massive immigration and government mandated and enforced so called diversity it also means diversity in disease and parasitic infections as well. </p>

<p>It  Both New York and Chicago have large numbers of 3rd world immigrants and all kinds of diseases have been brought in. If SARS had been in Mexico instead of Canada, there never would have been a quarantine because it wouldn&rsquo;t be politically correct.</p>

Not to defend him, but do you think he made that decision on his own? <br>
He&rsquo;s the front man for a team.   As with everything else, I have no doubt that he&rsquo;s just mouthing the decisions handed to him by his clique of advisors.</p>

I presume these are just rhetorical questions!    There is no longer, alas, any Ellis Island.  No quarantines, no medical examinations. No health questions asked.   We were much more careful about these things in the past.  Now, I suppose, it would be seen as &#8220;discriminatory&#8221;.  Offensive.  Especially so to Third Worlders who might be bringing in such problems.  Mustn&rsquo;t offend their delicate sensibilities!  So their feelings are spared at the cost to our own citizens.</p>
<p>And with expanded air travel, there are now entry points all over the USA,  not just at major coastal ports, even deep inside the country.  I just arrived in the US yesterday, at Dallas, on a flight from Frankfurt.  Other flights were simultaneously arriving from Bangkok and Mexico City.  Everyone, citizens and foreigners alike,  indiscriminately, went through the same  brief, cursory passport control and customs, all very  summary, and then we were inside the USA to go and do as we pleased.  It was a breeze.</p>
<p>There are NO checks upon leaving a country   &mdash;   other than the normal security check before boarding the plane.   [The sole exception, that I know of, is flying out of Toronto: you go through US customs THERE, instead of upon arival HERE. That is a unique arrangement.]</p>
<p>Furthermore, my experience, upon entering Europe nowadays, is that they have even less control than we do.    Aside from 10 seconds to stamp your passport and wave you through, there is no customs to go through  [although it exists nominally]  nor any paperwork or questions involved.  You just walk through the gate marked, &#8220;Nothing to declare&#8221; and you&rsquo;re in!   Declaring items is purely voluntary.  And there are no longer any passport formalities between the countries either, once you&rsquo;re in.  </p>
<p>This is all part of the new globalization that has been mandated for us, from above. It is supposed to be so much easier, they tell us.  We have to be open to the world.  But the side effects have not been considered.  I don&rsquo;t think they have even yet been seen.  With all this greatly increased air travel, Third World migration, and casual border formalities, the future could hold some terrible epidemics in store. Once again, our &#8220;authorities&#8221; have been asleep at the switch.   </p>

<p>Yes, I do.  It&rsquo;s obvious to me that was one of his ad libs.  His advisors aren&rsquo;t that stupid.  We will be able to pick up on many gaffs he makes revealing his lack of any real intellect whenever he&rsquo;s not reading the teleprompter or has practised lines from his advisors.<br>

<p>He&rsquo;s definitely a &#8220;front man&#8221; whose advisors do his thinking for him.  There&rsquo;s no question of that.</p>
<p>But this is just one of his slips. We&rsquo;ll see many more.</p>
<p>Watch him if he really gets under pressure during some kind of extremely tight situation and notice how he flubs.</p>
<p>Also, watch him lose his cool completely when things get so bad he&rsquo;s going to get blamed for his actions.  He&rsquo;ll lose it, and we&rsquo;ll more than likely see the real messiah.</p>

     A couple years ago a Mexican at my job was chatting with me, and mentioned that it was time to de-worm his kids.  I asked what he was talking about and he was surprised that I didn&rsquo;t regularly de-worm myself.  I suppose he thought that I was some kind of unclean, wormy gringo, and recommended a product I&rsquo;d never heard of.  Out of curiosity I checked at the local supermarket, and yep, they have the stuff.  If it has shelf space, the Mexicans must be needing it and buying it.  Maybe that&rsquo;s why Mexicans aren&rsquo;t big on shaking hands.</p>

<p>I called up the book you recommended on Amazon and noticed it is sold out and wait listed  &mdash;  maybe others from AmRen took heed of your recommendation?  There are a few used books available so I will order one of those.</p>
<p>When I googled &#8216;Tapworms and&hellip;&rsquo; (wasn&rsquo;t sure if you were referring to a book or an on-line article) this came up on the first page:</p>
<p>Natural Parasite Cleanse<br>
Safely remove tapeworm &amp; their eggs<br>
Rid your body of harmful parasites.<br>
ParasiteCleanse.com</p>
<p>Maybe a lot out there are in need of this product?</p>
<p>I thought my 15 year old son would enjoy reading this book  &mdash;  he has to have a teacher- approved non-fiction book for an up-coming summer school class.  Can&rsquo;t wait to hear about the teacher&rsquo;s reaction.</p>
<p>This topic has also been covered on Animal Planet and a segment of Mystery Diagnosis on Discovery Health (the NY Jewish/Guatemalan servant connection).  It was disgusting (but not to my 15 year old).  The reaction Ewwwww is quite correct&hellip;</p>

		<p>Americans and others have been traveling to Mexico and other Latin American countries for many decades regardless of the clear knowledge of the general poor substructure of cities, the poor hypenic habits of the people, etc.  This article shows how even an ethnic groups with relgious laws aimed at group survival through good hygenic habits is rendered defenseless by mere contact with groups who are less - fastidious.</p>
<p>This is one of several reasons why I will not go to a Mexican food restaurant.  One other reason is that I refuse to give one penny to encourage them.  But I also eat out much less than I used to due to the high number of them working in restaurants today.  I stick to local shops where I know who is working behind the scenes.</p>

		<p>Whiteplight is right, only eat out when you absolutely have to, and try to find out who is working the kitchen.  Here in Kalifohnia, practically everyone in the back of restaurants is Mexican.  If you don&rsquo;t like to cook, buy prepared food from gourmet markets   &mdash;    you can usually see who is preparing it behind the counter.  Then cook or reheat at home.  You&rsquo;ll save a lot of money and you probably won&rsquo;t get sick.</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s ironic that, with a group of Third World illegals who are well known for their diseases, they commonly take jobs such as restaurant workers or house cleaners&hellip; both of which are likely ways to spread their diseases to native-born Americans who have probably never even heard of these things!  I work as a medical transcriptionist here in So. Cal., and the emergency rooms are full of Hispanics with brain worms (cysticercosis).  Yecch!</p>
