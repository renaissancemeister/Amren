			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Beverley Rouse, Press Association, May 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sixteen people banned from entering the UK were &#8220;named and shamed&#8221; by the Home Office today.</p>
<p>Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said she decided to make public the names of 16 people banned since October so others could better understand what sort of behaviour Britain was not prepared to tolerate.</p>
<p>The list includes hate preachers, anti-gay protesters and a far- right US talk show host.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s important that people understand the sorts of values and sorts of standards that we have here, the fact that it&rsquo;s a privilege to come and the sort of things that mean you won&rsquo;t be welcome in this country,&#8221; Ms Smith told GMTV.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming to this country is a privilege. If you can&rsquo;t live by the rules that we live by, the standards and the values that we live by, we should exclude you from this country and, what&rsquo;s more, now we will make public those people that we have excluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are publishing the names of 16 of those that we have excluded since October. We are telling people who they are and why it is we don&rsquo;t want them in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said the number of people excluded from Britain had risen from an average of two a month to five a month since October.</p>
<p>The list of the 16 &#8220;least wanted&#8221; includes radio talk show host Michael Savage, real name Michael Weiner.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is someone who has fallen into the category of fomenting hatred, of such extreme views and expressing them in such a way that it is actually likely to cause inter-community tension or even violence if that person were allowed into the country,&#8221; Ms Smith told BBC Breakfast.</p>
<p>Also named are American Baptist pastor Fred Waldron Phelps Snr and his daughter Shirley Phelps-Roper, who have picketed the funerals of Aids victims and claimed the deaths of US soldiers are a punishment for US tolerance of homosexuality.</p>
<p>&#8220;If people have so clearly overstepped the mark in terms of the way not just that they are talking but the sort of attitudes that they are expressing to the extent that we think that this is likely to cause or have the potential to cause violence or inter-community tension in this country, then actually I think the right thing is not to let them into the country in the first place. Not to open the stable door then try to close it later,&#8221; Ms Smith said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a privilege to come to this country. There are certain behaviours that mean you forfeit that privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hamas MP Yunis Al-Astal, Jewish extremist Mike Guzovsky, former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard Stephen Donald Black and neo-Nazi Erich Gliebe are also on the list released today.</p>
<p>Artur Ryno and Pavel Skachevsky, the former leaders of a violent Russian skinhead gang which committed 20 racially motivated murders, are also banned from coming to Britain. Both are currently in prison.</p>
<p>Making up the rest of the 16 named by the Home Office today are preachers Wadgy Abd El Hamied Mohamed Ghoneim, Abdullah Qadri Al Ahdal, Safwat Hijazi and Amir Siddique, Muslim activist Abdul Ali Musa (previously Clarence Reams), murderer and Hezbollah terrorist Samir Al Quntar and Kashmiri terror group leader Nasr Javed.<br/>

			<p>The great irony of this is that Michael Savage isn&rsquo;t as right wing as a lot of people think he is, and not as right-wing as some of the names on this list.  Remember the story here on AR several months ago when he wrote an insulting e-mail to the AR staff about the &#8220;evils of racism&#8221; and a bromide about &#8220;Obama&rsquo;s too green not too black.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a teachable moment.  When it comes to neo-Marxists (i.e. liberals), you&rsquo;re either with them *all the way* or you&rsquo;re Hitler times ten.  No room for &#8220;backsliding&#8221; as much as one millimeter.</p>
<p>If I had serious political power in this stead, I would treat the UKSSR like Cuba, i.e. no diplomatic relations, and the creation of an immigration adjustment act to give blanket residency to persecuted white right-wing Britons who can make it to American territory.</p>

			<p>They can include ME as 17. The PC fools at the &#8216;Home Office&rsquo; can bar me as well. Michael Savage is a breath of fresh air on talk radio, and while I dont always agree with him, he is free to say what he likes. Too bad the tolerant only tolerate whats not difficult or what agrees with their PC opinions. That is not the meaning of free speech. </p>

			<p>Hasn&rsquo;t the internet rendered this sort of thing somewhat irrelevant?  Unless the Powers That Be are willing to block access to unapproved web sites, the way China does, anyone in the UK can read Savage&rsquo;s opinions &amp; correspond with him via email.   No long, expensive plane flight is really necessary.  </p>

			<p>Jihadists who blow up buses and people are o.k. with this disgusting woman; preaching jihad in the mosques is o.k.; violent blacks are o.k. too; however, conservative points of view and the people who advocate those views are a threat to the political insanity going on right now in Britain.</p>

			<p>As a response to this, I think a boycott of British-made products is eminently reasonable.  If it is a priviledge for us to visit Britain, it is also a priviledge for them to trade with the rest of the world; our money is not something to which they are automatically entitled.</p>

			<p>We just finished learning about John Stuart Mill in my political philosophy class. While I&rsquo;m sure many will (rightly) blame him as a granddaddy of modern liberalism, he regarded the right to dissent, to say things the masses don&rsquo;t want to hear, as a central to preserving intellectual discourse. Without dissent, even a society that believes the &#8220;right&#8221; things will collapse into dead dogma; if their beliefs are never challenged they don&rsquo;t know WHY they believing them.<br/>
Dead Dogma accurately describes most modern liberalism.<br/>
What would Mill think of his country today with its hate-speech laws?</p>

			<p>I listen to Michael Savage almost every night online [while reading Amren], and find him to be a voice of logic in a sea of insanity. This will INCREASE his popularity. </p>

			<p>I used to love England and visiting there was great.  For some time now, I have had no desire to go there ever again.  What for?, a London full of non-British, third world refugees daring me to walk on the sidewalk near them? Go to many a village and there is some swarthy character looking you over. </p>
<p>There is nothing in England left to make this one time Anglophile ever want to revisit - goodbye England.</p>

			<p>Wow, is mental illness running rampant in the U.K. or what???<br/>
These people are so confused, they are confusing me!<br/>
Allow me to quote again.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s important that people understand the sorts of values and sorts of standards that we have here, the fact that it&rsquo;s a privilege to come and the sort of things that mean you won&rsquo;t be welcome in this country,&rdquo; Ms Smith told GMTV.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming to this country is a privilege. If you can&rsquo;t live by the rules that we live by, the standards and the values that we live by, we should exclude you from this country and, what&rsquo;s more, now we will make public those people that we have excluded.&#8221;<br/>
===Okay, so, let me get this right. Wasn&rsquo;t the last article about giving amnesty to the poor, downtrodden illegals? Not to do so would be &#8220;inhumane&#8221;?<br/>
But isn&rsquo;t the above exactly what the illegals there are doing? It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that going to the U.K. is a privelge at all. Every denizen from the third world tiolet is thumbing their noses and sneaking into that country. Sharia law is taking over, which, as far as I know, was never a British standard or value. I don&rsquo;t think genital mutilation and gang rapes are either but i don&rsquo;t see any Somalis being excluded from your country. <br/>
Do Muslims tolerate homosexuality? </p>
<p>My heart truly goes out to my Brit brothers and sisters. You are losing yur country at a more alarming rate than we are losing ours.<br/>

Savage&rsquo;s response:<br/>
&#8220;This lunatic &hellip; is linking me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia, she&rsquo;s putting me in a league with Hamas murderers who kill Jews on busses,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have never advocated violence &hellip; I&rsquo;ve been on the air 15 years. My views may be inflammatory, but they&rsquo;re not violent in any way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he has been defamed and endangered by the British government action. &#8220;She has painted a target on my back, linking me with people who are in prison for killing people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Does she not think people might hunt me down?&#8221; </p>
<p>Savage is probably right, he is just a right wing talker on <br/>
radio.    Home Secretary Jacqui Smith is starting a very bad precedent by classifing people as violent and reprehensible when their only &#8220;sin&#8221; is practicing free speech.   The Brits also enjoy free speech and the unwise attack on Michael Savage is going to result in some serious blow back and may even cause unwanted tension between countries.<br/>

			<p>I think that it&rsquo;s ironic that Michael Savage is barred from the UK for his supposed &#8220;hate speech&#8221; but Muslims are allowed to protest on the streets of the UK and scream at the top of their lungs &#8220;Death to the UK and Death to the US.&#8221;  If that&rsquo;s not inciting hatred, I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>
<p>As for the preacher and his daughter mentioned above, while they have a right to their opinions, I don&rsquo;t have much sympathy for them.  </p>
<p>In December of 2008, I lost my youngest sister and 4 nieces to a drunk driver.  The story made national news and people from all over the country were so supportive.  During the memorial service in Baltimore, followers of this preacher and his daughter were picketing outside my sister and nieces&rsquo; memorial service.  They claimed that my sister and nieces&rsquo; deaths, were God&rsquo;s retribution for a million dollar judgment entered against their church by a Maryland Court.  A year before they had picketed a soldier&rsquo;s funeral and the family sued.</p>
<p>As for Michael Savage, I listen to him every chance I get.  Nothing he says isn&rsquo;t the truth and that&rsquo;s what Ms. Smith&rsquo;s problem is - the truth.  People like her, who speak of tolerance and diversity of opinion and inclusiviness, only mean those that agree with her.  I heard Michael Savage say last night on his show that he was going to sue this woman and the UK government for slander.  I hope he goes forward with it.  People like Ms. Smith need to be stopped.</p>

			<p>What really ticks me off about this is the way the term &lsquo;Far Right wing&rsquo; is used against Savage as though it is an insult; As far as I&rsquo;m concerned the farthest Right one can go is to be Conservative therefore I am proudly &#8216;Far Right&rsquo;. But we all know what the intention here is, i.e. to label Conservatives as &#8216;on the same track as Fascists/Nazis/Hitler. The dirty secret that Left-wingers fear becoming common knowledge and which is now emerging is that the above-mentioned were Socialists, i.e. Leftists on the same track as the Marxists and other totalitarians. Wilson and his Progressives, who Hilary admires so much, were admirers of Mussolini and Fascism.<br/>
It is time for those on the right to spread this truism and stop the slander. <br/>
To this end, I never write or speak about Marxists /Leftists/Progressives without including the Fascists and Hitler as being part of their ideology; any howls of protest permit me to enlighten them further.<br/>
I&rsquo;m off on my annual trip to Eire and England shortly. Like Whiteplight states it&rsquo;s becoming ever more difficult to feel comfortable in my homeland, to walk  past the Mosques, burka clad women,  schoolyards 100% black/Muslim, their uniforms adapted to cover  Muslim girls, not an English child in sight.  It&rsquo;s truly alarming because I know I should not be there, I&rsquo;m not welcome; this can be seen on the faces of scowling men and yoofs and the chattering women whose eyes follow me. Entire streets look like the Kasbahs with alien smells, customs and products. If it were not for visiting my family I would never go.  I know I couldn&rsquo;t live there again, not with the Govt. so clearly intent on destroying Britain&rsquo;s heritage and the EU encouraging the Caliphate. I might get a picture-story together of some the gems of enrichment and diverrrrrsity.<br/>
Good luck to Savage with his lawsuit, I don&rsquo;t always agree with him, but like the man (Orwell?) said: &#8221; &#8216;Freedom of speech&rsquo; is meaningless unless it includes the freedom to say what others don&rsquo;t want to hear&#8221;.<br/>
Arc.<br/>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s an excellent example of a woman who has been programmed how to think and what to think, and it&rsquo;s a chilling reminder that there are millions of other weak-minded whites throughout the Western world.</p>
<p>And for the other adherents, just let me say that being young is no excuse for having your mind programmed.  Many of us have received the same input as others, but we are intelligent enough to resist the obvious nonsense of those who advocate PC theories.</p>

			<p>Weiner is sometimes fun to hear when he rants about liberals. It sort of reminds me of the &#8220;five minute hate&#8221; that was heard on the radio in the novel &#8220;1984&#8221;.  But the policies of Weiner would still have the long term effect of turning the nation into a multiracial, multicultural polyglot.  I think that the country was far better off before Mr. Weiner&rsquo;s ancestors arrived and helped turn America into what it has sadly become today.  We didn&rsquo;t deserve this treatment at the hands of people we allowed to join us.  The ultimate irony is that these very policies of Mr. Weiner&rsquo;s ancestors and relatives are threatening to him now.</p>

			<p>I listen to both Savage and Mark Levin, Mark is far more outspoken than Savage I guess in the New America white conservatives better keep their mouths shut unless they are willing to pay Serious Consequences?  The New Order taking America over doesn&rsquo;t seem to like OR tolerate the conservative viewpoint? Soon it might be (whiteman) bow down to the black, bow down to the illegal, bow down to anyone Not White or you will dealt with??</p>

			<p>The cognitive dissonance is absolutely staggering:</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming to this country is a privilege. If you can&rsquo;t live by the rules that we live by, the standards and the values that we live by, we should exclude you from this country&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8221;, of course, refers to the liberal power elite.  But the reality is quite different:  at the same time, this same elite is replacing the native population with those who don&rsquo;t live by the same rules (sharia law, for example), and whose standards and values are those of other cultures.</p>
<p>This is probably the scariest thing I have seen in a while, in terms of liberal intolerance.<br/>

			<p>Being blacklisted from the UK will only increase Savage&rsquo;s popularity and influence.  Remember what happened when the UK wouldn&rsquo;t let Geert Wilders visit the country?  His party skyrocketed in the polls.<br/>
It seems as if someone from the SPLC has been advising the British government.  This is certainly one of their tactics: list &#8220;mainstream&#8221; right-wingers alongside neo-nazis and skinheads who no one would deny are extremists.  Was there really any legitimate purpose for releasing this list?  Were the couple of skinhead gang members from Russia really going to visit the UK any time soon?  Why put Savage on the list and not the thousands of other writers, bloggers, and activists who are much more &#8220;right-wing&#8221; than he is?  Why would a country that allows thousands of rapists and murderers cross it borders every year be worried about a radio host?  I suspect this has something to do with the upcoming EU elections.  Maybe the Labour Party is trying to make being right-wing appear anti-British in order to hurt the BNP.</p>

<p>Yes, it is ironic that Michael Savage is being thrown into our camp. However, he does support a few of our issues. I&rsquo;m in favor of anyone who infuriates our Fourth Estate enemies. I notice that the BBC repeatedly refers to him as &#8220;Mr. Weiner&#8221; pointing out his Jewish background. This was a well known tactic used against &#8220;Rootless Cosmopolitans&#8221; in Soviet times. It&rsquo;s disgusting that they ban the man from entering formerly Great Britain just because they don&rsquo;t like his views. Mr. Savage is not a criminal and has no communicable diseases. They have allowed far worse to enter and re-enter England. Vote BNP!!</p>

			<p>I was listening to Savage and he said they put him on this list.  It&rsquo;s funny that they won&rsquo;t allow conservatives there (&#8216;hate speech&rsquo;, you know), yet they&rsquo;ll allow the immigrants to preach &#8220;Death to Europe&#8221; or put up a shrine of Malcolm X, a man who hated white people.  </p>

			<p>How sad and how alarming!</p>
<p>The noble nation which produced the right of true free speech now has a one-woman committee with the divine right of liberals to decree what is acceptable political opinion, along with the authority to bar law-abiding persons who simply express disagreement with governmental policy?!</p>
<p>Thank God for the United States Constitution and the Englishmen-Americans who drafted it! May the American people take notice and prepare to protect their hard-won legitimate rights!</p>
<p>&#8220;United States Constitution</p>
<p>Bill of Rights </p>
<p>Amendment I<br/>
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.&#8221; </p>

			<p>I hope AMREN will forgive me but I repeat a comment I just posted on digg. I trust he will read this as it&rsquo;s an open lettter to him. It&rsquo;s not always a good idea to send for your lawyers, especially in Britain. We don&rsquo;t like it and tend to do things a little differently. However, take a deep breath, count to 99 and think on this. Stay in USA for now, log on to our wonderful BNP website, which I&rsquo;m sure you will enjoy, and use your show to promote us. You may even comment right here on digg. It&rsquo;s a free country. Then you can join our ranks. Now THAT would really shake up our establishment. We can then invite you over to speak about our success in the MEP elections. By the way, Paul Revere never did ride shouting &#8216;The British are coming&rsquo;.<br/>

			<p>&ldquo;Coming to this country is a privilege. If you can&rsquo;t live by the rules that we live by, the standards and the values that we live by, we should exclude you from this country and, what&rsquo;s more, now we will make public those people that we have excluded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow&hellip;seig-heil Jacqi! Thanks for the UK cultural update announcing that freedom of speech is officially no longer part of &#8220;the standards and the values that (The British) live by.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the way, what&rsquo;s the politically correct uniform in Old Blighty these days - Brownshirts?</p>

			<p>It sure looks like only the intolerant can save the UK now, so this move is kind of ironic. Forget saving the UK &#8216;racially&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s way too late for that. There is Scotland and Wales however. So, should the average European really want to save the UK? I suppose there is always bragging rights for the politician or the activist&hellip; but remember, pride is sin. </p>
<p>The method seems to be, create huge problems for everyone, use manufactured public opinion to blame it all on one group, in this case white men, then legislate against - and above all make this group effectively silent, making public opinion official. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a proven system of success. It worked for the Germans. </p>

			<p>Another example of this was when the US banned then Austrian PM Kurt Waldheim, a sitting head of state, from visiting the US.  His popularity went up at home, with much of Austria basically &#8220;Up yours, USA - we don&rsquo;t care!&#8221;</p>

			<p> &#8220;I listen to both Savage and Mark Levin,   Mark is far more outspoken than Savage.  I guess in the New America white conservatives better keep their mouths shut unless they are willing to pay Serious Consequences? <br/>
The New Order taking America over doesn&rsquo;t seem to like OR tolerate the conservative viewpoint? &#8220;<br/>

 I am amazed at the number of naive &#8220;white conservatives&#8221; posting above who take their political cues from the likes of Mr. Savage.   It&rsquo;s evident that the New Order has largely taken over America, and  through these pied pipers it already controls  &#8220;the [so-called] conservative viewpoint&#8221;.</p>
