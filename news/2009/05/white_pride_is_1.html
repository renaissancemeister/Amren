			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Sailer, Taki&rsquo;s Magazine, May 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Following up on <a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/whiteout/" target="taylor" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>Jared Taylor&rsquo;s article,</b></a> the Ricci reverse discrimination lawsuit now before the Supreme Court is not one of those &#8220;hard cases&#8221; about which law students are warned. There is nothing anomalous about the discrimination against the New Haven firemen who had their top scores in the 2003 civil service exam thrown out by the city because no blacks scored high enough to get promotions. Employment decisions being rigged to prevent &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; on &#8220;protected minorities&#8221; is just business as usual in America since the 1970s.</p>
<p>Instead, what&rsquo;s unusual is that we&rsquo;re even hearing about the victimization of these unprotected majorities.</p>
<p>I suspect that&rsquo;s largely because Frank Ricci and his friends are firemen. Fire fighters show up more than any other profession in prominent reverse discrimination suits, perhaps because they enjoy civil service protection, unions, and, most of all, public admiration.</p>
<p>In a culture that increasingly holds blue-collar workers in contempt, firemen are the exception to the rule. They risk their lives for you, and they don&rsquo;t give you speeding tickets. As the cops in Joseph Wambaugh&rsquo;s LAPD novels are always telling each other: If you really wanted people to like you, you should have been a fireman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth exploring some of the more subtle game theory reasons why there is so little public outcry against discrimination against white males other than fire fighters. Why is Ricci close to being the exception that proves the rule?</p>
<p>First, affirmative action targets marginal white males.</p>
<p>For example, although white guys who are already firemen have a fighting chance of staving off unfair treatment in promotions, white guys who just want to become firemen are discriminated against in hiring with impunity. For example, a couple of years ago, the Bush Administration sued the New York fire department, which lost 343 men on 9/11, for discrimination because its entrance exam had a one standard deviation gap in its passing rate between whites and blacks, the same cognitive racial gap seen more or les everywhere.</p>
<p>The message the Bush Administration&rsquo;s lawsuit was implicitly sending the FDNY was: &#8220;Hire more minorities and fewer whites. We don&rsquo;t care how you do it. Just do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cheating an already employed white fireman out of a promotion is dicey because he doesn&rsquo;t go away. He&rsquo;s still a fireman. So he hangs around, he complains, he organizes other white firemen to complain to their aldermen about why the politicians aren&rsquo;t releasing the results, maybe he talks his sister-in-law&rsquo;s cousin who is a file clerk in Personnel into Xeroxing the secret results of the test and leak it to him. And then he hires a lawyer.</p>
<p>In contrast, cheating some random white guy off the street out of his lifelong dream of being a fireman is a piece of cake: &#8220;Don&rsquo;t call us, we&rsquo;ll call you.&#8221; What can this marginal man do about his suspicions? Not much. He&rsquo;s not connected.</p>
<p>Moreover, announcing that you are a victim of affirmative action is to admit you are marginal, that you would have only barely made the cut anyway. How uncool is that?</p>
<p>Similarly, affirmative action, by definition, doesn&rsquo;t impact those who made the cut. Consider Harvard students. While some freshmen may enter Harvard sore that affirmative action might have cost high school friends admission to Harvard, soon they have lots of swell new friends, who, unsurprisingly, are all Harvard students, unlike those losers they used to hang around with in high school who didn&rsquo;t have what it takes to get into Harvard.</p>
<p>Hence, you don&rsquo;t see a lot of solidarity in opposing affirmative action.</p>
<p>Moreover, as you go up the pyramid of power, quotas becomes less prevalent, as the elite decide to finally draw the line so that affirmative action least inconveniences them.</p>
<p>Reflect upon the career of the First Lady. Michelle Obama attended Whitney Young H.S., the most selective Chicago public high school, where blacks enjoyed a quota of 40 percent of admissions. Then she was off to Princeton and Harvard Law School. At each institution, she felt that white people were making fun of her because her test scores weren&rsquo;t all that great. Still, like a lot of mediocre black law students, she wound up with a high-paying job at a prestigious law firm.</p>
<p>The New York Times reported on UCLA law professor Richard Sander&rsquo;s study of affirmative action in legal hiring:</p>
<p>But most black associates were hired due to racial preferences. According to the New York Times, &#8220;Black students, who make up 1 to 2 percent of students with high grades (meaning a grade point average in the top half of the class) make up 8 percent of corporate law firm hires, Professor Sander found. &#8216;Blacks are far more likely to be working at large firms than are other new lawyers with similar credentials,&rsquo; he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, however, colorblind reality intruded. Mrs. Obama apparently didn&rsquo;t pass the rather easy Illinois bar exam on her first opportunity. Soon, she gave up her law license and took a less cognitively taxing job working for Mayor Daley as a political fixer.</p>
<p>Think about it from Mrs. Obama&rsquo;s point of view. She&rsquo;d been scraping by on affirmative action for years, but quotas mostly evaporate when it comes to making partner. The law firm&rsquo;s partners can put up with employing subpar blacks as associates for a few years to stay out of trouble with the government, but they take the partnership hurdle seriously. The New York Times said: &#8220;But black lawyers, the study found, are about one-fourth as likely to make partner as white lawyers from the same entering class of associates.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, why kill herself in the likely hopeless task of making partner when she can go into Chicago politics, where she&rsquo;ll be smarter than the average ward heeler? (As an example of the kind of mental firepower it takes to succeed in Cook County politics, former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich told a high school student named Mihan Lee, &#8220;I had an 18 on my ACT score. I&rsquo;m told that&rsquo;s kind of in the middle, maybe just below. [It&rsquo;s around the 33rd percentile.] If I can be governor of Illinois, Mihan, you can be president of the United States.&#8221;)</p>
<p>So, the elites are less plagued by inept colleagues promoted due to racial preferences than their underlings are. Why, then, get annoyed by something that won&rsquo;t much bother you personally?</p>
<p>Finally, the notion of white solidarity or white pride runs into the fundamental problem that whites mostly compete with each other for the best jobs. Competing with minorities is seen as evidence that you aren&rsquo;t very far up the ladder.</p>
<p>Consider the three Cs: Creativity, Competence, and Charisma.</p>
<p>On the whole, whites tend to perform fairly well in terms of creativity, competence, and charisma, and thus tend to end up in the coolest jobs. In contrast, blacks are strongest at charisma and weakest at competence, while East Asians are the opposite. Mexican-Americans tend to be low in charisma and creativity (the proportion of famous Americans who are of Mexican descent is minimal), while perhaps moderate in competence.</p>
<p>Screenwriting is an example of a job that demands some high quantities of each category. Scripting movies is not the highest paid, most influential, most fun, or most desirable job in the country, but it comes close enough on all those dimensions to attract a huge number of would-be entrants.</p>
<p>Who wind up the screenwriters of Hollywood films? Although minorities buy a large fraction of movie tickets each weekend, 94 percent of employed screenwriters in 2004 were white.</p>
<p>Screenwriting is one of those jobs where, for a variety of reasons, affirmative action doesn&rsquo;t much apply. (In a more rational world, the reverse would be true: we&rsquo;d have racial quotas for screenwriters but not for fire captains. After all, whom do you rely upon to save your loved ones from flaming deaths? In a more sensible America, Frank Ricci would have his promotion but Akiva Goldsman would have gotten bumped off &#8220;Angels &amp; Demons&#8221; for a handicapped Hispanic lesbian.)</p>
<p>Likewise, over 90 percent of the staff at the major New York magazines are white. (Heck, only two of the nine staffers have Spanish surnames at the Pew Hispanic Center.)</p>
<p>So, you don&rsquo;t see a lot of Hollywood movies or glossy magazine articles about whites victimized by racial preferences. This just isn&rsquo;t a problem they have to deal with.</p>
<p>Thus, promoting white solidarity sounds almost as implausible to white people trying to claw their way to the top as promoting Vertebrate Pride would seem: Sure, us vertebrates are definitely the coolest subphylum, but it&rsquo;s kind of hard to get worked up over how all us vertebrates should stick together when the competition is just a bunch of invertebrates.</p>

			<p>Taki Theodoracopulous is being rather pompous here.  Are we only allowed to be against AA because it affect firefighters?  Are we supposed to kick so-called &#8220;marginal whites&#8221; to the curb?  The hard fact of the matter is that &#8220;marginal whites&#8221; are probably brighter than 90% of blacks.  And I would take a &#8220;marginal white&#8221; before a marginal black.  The marginal white is our people, the marginal black is not.</p>
<p>TT is not a WN, and isn&rsquo;t much of a RR.  I would classify him as an aracial paleocon.  Why PJB just had to have him as editor of TAC is beyond me.   Then again, there&rsquo;s the whole PJB and Ezola Foster fiasco, and PJB is more aracial paleocon than WN.</p>

<p>As is typical of Mr. Sailer, he assumes that every white person in the country is just like him, merely scratching at elitism and wishing for better. In undergrad, I went to the University of Michigan; I had no problem getting in there, but I did have high school friends who didn&rsquo;t and should have been there except for affirmative action. You see, about 15% to 20% of my incoming &ldquo;classmates&rdquo; were nonwhites, that simply could barely form normal verbal utterances, let alone coherent written exercises requiring standard sentences and paragraphs. </p>
<p>Oh, of course, when their sub-mediocre work saw them with a generously granted C, they bellowed about &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; to any who cared to listen, and also to many (including myself) who didn&rsquo;t. But that only solidified my contempt for them, not the white people who they had clearly cheated out of a rightful place in that university, including some of my friends from high school. This was because those whites (be they known to me or not,) would have at least put up a studiously dogged struggle to get a B the next time, and not hooted and chirped like feral baboons deprived of a cantaloupe they didn&rsquo;t get, but felt entitled to for simply breathing and defecating regularly.</p>
<p>That is the point Mr. Sailer consistently misses, when he is discussing the racial spoils system-USA; for every glibly unconcerned white like him, there are probably at a minimum 5 to 10 who harbor the angst and anger that I do about the travesty of forced multicultural &ldquo;equality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

			<p><i>Finally, the notion of white solidarity or white pride runs into the fundamental problem that whites mostly compete with each other for the best jobs.</i><p>I heartily agree!  Not only that: White competitiveness is quite evident in white nationalism too.  Whereas the average &#8220;diversity&#8221;-indoctrinated white person actively competes with his fellow whites in unctuous professions of officious commitment to non-discrimination, anti-racism, etc. (and we&rsquo;ve all observed this in our daily lives), the white nationalists play the &#8220;more racialist than thou&#8221; game, trying to outdo one another in professed commitment to the preservation of the white race, which many of them define in ever narrower and more exclusive terms.  It is no wonder that to many whites who might otherwise be interested in WN, &#8220;white pride&#8221; seems dour, unwelcoming and &#8220;uncool.&#8221;</p></p>

			<p>But what does this say about the morals and ethical principles of the legal profession?</p>
<p>They tout something called &#8220;the rule of law&#8221; but don&rsquo;t apply it in this case.</p>
<p>Legislators in Congress take an oath to uphold &#8220;the Constitution and laws of the United States.&#8221;  That means the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 14th Amendment, which guarantees to all citizens &#8220;the equal protection of the law.&#8221;  Hubert Humphrey who shepherded the Civil Rights Act through Congress said if there were anything in the law that allowed discrimination against whites he would eat it page by page.  If he were alive today, he&rsquo;d have indigestion.</p>
<p>But every time I&rsquo;ve brought this matter to their attention, all I get is silence and avoidance.  And contempt.</p>

			<p>Steve Sailer:enough of the silly policy wonkishness. Enough of the social science jargon(game theory). White Nationalism is now the only game in town. It is the only political movement that can stop the race replacement of Native Born White Americans. <br>
Native Born White Americans will either politically organize around race or face complete racial and economic dispossession at thehands of post-1965 hispanics,asians,muslims and africans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marginal&#8221; White Males should be encouraged to politically organize race. It is one minute before for Native Born White Americans within the borders of America.</p>

			<p><i>Moreover, announcing that you are a victim of affirmative action is to admit you are marginal, that you would have only barely made the cut anyway. How uncool is that?</i></p>
<p>Because we all know that &#8220;cool&#8221; and &#8220;uncool&#8221; are writ in stone, unchangeable for all time.  And the media (and the elite discussed below) have no influence on, or interest in, what falls into which category.  So &#8220;cool&#8221; and &#8220;uncool&#8221; are valid, objective, relevant categories in this context.</p>
<p><i>Similarly, affirmative action, by definition, doesn&rsquo;t impact those who made the cut. Consider Harvard students.

<p>Which explains why blacks don&rsquo;t get bent out of shape about these things, either.</p>

			<p>Sailer can be very superficial. By the way, Jenniger Gratz didn&rsquo;t hink it was uncool to sue over being denied a seat at the U Michigan law school. Remeber the second of the two Phil Donahue shows Jared Taylor appeared on. Remember the 40 year old White engineer who complained bitterly about being passed over for promotion. The promotion went to a 25 year old off the boat hindu LEGAL immigrant. Go read the  transcript of the second show that Jared appeared on. Was this guy being uncool Steve?</p>
<p>Steve Sailer:&#8221;marginal&#8221; Native Born White American Males should be encouraged to revolt against thier race replacement at the hands of post-1965 hispanics,muslims,africans &hellip;and asians-the LEGAL immigrant group that you are very fond of.</p>

			<p>Sailor makes a very good point that the higher one goes up the pole (the more one would be able to do something about it), the less reasons one has to be disgruntled, or even notice what&rsquo;s going on at all. Also they have to lose if they were to notice, it&rsquo;s not cool being pro-white. &#8216;Minorities&rsquo;, however, have their own reasons for not noticing and maintaining silence. They also maintain sympathy with, at all times, and act for the benefit of their fellow proletariat they may not even know. They understand them, sure, the lowest are now the cultural leaders, but they do not always know them. They maintain absolute solidarity with those gleefully tormenting and discriminating against whites at any opportunity. For that matter, so do most &#8216;right-thinking&rsquo; whites.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s worth exploring some of the more subtle game theory reasons why there is so little public outcry against discrimination against white males other than fire fighters.&#8221;</p>
<p>No exploration necessary.  To begin with, do not confuse, inadvertently or otherwise, the public with MSM.  It has been proven time and time again that the MSM does not speak for the majority of Americans.  But what the media have done, and still do, is use the communist tactic of &#8220;create the illusion of popular support&#8221;, or in other words, lie.  This tactic was used to the extreme back in the &#8216;60&rsquo;s &#8220;snivel rights&#8221; movement, as a means of shutting down or attacking opposition to the movement, and intimidating those who otherwise may have expressed opposition. Because much of the public were not aware of any opposition, they assumed most went along.     </p>
<p>The &#8220;reasons [or reason] why there is so little public outcry against discrimination against white males other than fire fighters&#8221; is, up until the Internet blossomed, the MSM and their embedded elite, held most all the cards when it came to what was covered in media news.  If the elite didn&rsquo;t approve it, it got no exposure.  </p>
<p>As for the elite, they have NO concern for minorities, other than to USE them for political mileage.  Transcripts of some of Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s rampages against minorities have been quite revealing, and interesting.<br>

isn&rsquo;t writing about what should be but just <br>
explaining the way things are (in a somewhat<br>
flippant fashion). I seriously doubt he&rsquo;s <br>
indifferent to the plight of marginal white males.</p>

<p><br>
I agree.  this Affirmative Action nonsense is a step backward for our society and for race relations.  By lowering standards for Blacks, society is constantly telling them that they are inferior to other races and reinforces the idea that they cannot compete on a level playing field.  Therefore, should be judge on a much easier scale.  </p>
<p>Regardless of what side of the fence you are on, I just don&rsquo;t see how you can support this kind of policy.<br>

			<p>The Steve Sailer crowd has a lot of very smart folks, but they have an unrealistic worldview that ignores any whites who don&rsquo;t fall in the top segment of the IQ/socioeconomic bell curve. When they say people who &#8220;don&rsquo;t make the cut,&#8221; they are dismissing the majority of whites. </p>
<p>The Sailer crowd would prefer to have a black and brown servant caste to gripe about and feel separate from, because it would save them the horror of fitting in among organic society with a healthy and respected white working class. That hurdle aside, Sailerites are a smart and turned on bunch and they see past some important aspects of knee jerk pseudo-conservativism. </p>

			<p>Missing the point! What this fool is missing is that White pride and some sense of White solidarity acted on is necessary for White survival. It is not about what, say, black solidarity is about: affirmative action and special legal protections - which is what this fool is comparing it to - it is about stopping all the pandering to other races by our sell-out politicians (including sellouts like W. Bush, McCain, Lindsey Graham etc&hellip;)that for decades has been bringing on a population replacement from Mexico, the Muslim mid-East &amp; other third world.</p>
<p>White pride is very cool because it is about something very different than all the other racial prides. It is about affirming what really deserves to be affirmed, that Whites have made the West and its civilizations, even with its faults, the best of civilizations (which it why it attracts so much immigration) and that Whites are absolutely necessary to keep it that way. </p>

			<p>Why so little public outcry?</p>
<p>Argumentum ad Baculum.  The people with the gold and the muscle make the rules.  Shut up unless you want to get hurt.  This says very little for the manly virtue and integrity of white men.  </p>
<p>Someone suggested to Wm. F. Buckley many years ago that the solution to the problem of racial preferences would be a law utlawing racial discrimination.  But we already had one in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Buckley replied that the law would have to read &#8220;racial discrimination is against the law AND THIS TIME WE REALLY MEAN IT.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor said in effect that the Supreme Court will let us know when flouting the law won&rsquo;t be necessary any longer.  </p>
<p>White people are in the position of Peter Keating, the self-less, other-directed character in Ayn Rand&rsquo;s The Fountainhead, who asked with bewilderment what he should do when a rival for his wife proposed that Keating sell her to him.  &#8220;What should you do?  You should have slapped my facr and challenged me to a duel five minutes ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>James Burnham and Lawrence Brown wrote, respectively, Suicide of the West and The Might of the West.  Both noted that in 1914 a map of the world showed complete white dominance of the earth.  Both books were written nearly half a century ago.  Since that time not only has white dominance retreated from the world and other nations, now, today, even in once white countries white men are on the run.  </p>
<p>When I complained on the front page of the Washington Times about racial discrimination against whites at the Social Security Administration I was suspended by one black supervisor, fired by another, and escorted from the building by an armed black policeman.  Before the hearing to which I was entitled under Civil Service rules a notice was sent to me saying that as a white male I was not allowed to appeal on the grounds of racial discrimination because only &#8220;protected groups&#8221; could do that.  At the hearing the Judge refused to define &#8220;protected group.&#8221;</p>
<p>What are you gonna do, white folks?  <br>

			<p>Unfortunately, one cannot know which blacks are qualified, and which are unqualified. Sailer discusses the career of Michelle Obama, and correctly points out that since she was unqualified for Princeton and Harvard Law, and was admitted only as an affirmative action quota, she felt intimidated and poorly prepared. Yet she was promoted each year to the next level for which she was unqualified and unprepared, and upon graduation she was unable to effectively practice law, and gave up her law license to accept a more lucrative affirmative action job. Yet now, she is hailed as a mentor to young blacks, and one of the most prominent and effective people in America. The author could easily have chosen Barack Obama instead of his wife as the example of failed affirmative action programs, but perhaps his sensitivities forbade him doing so. We will eventually see that Barack is just as unprepared and unqualified as Michelle, but we will have to wait until the adoring mass media wakes up to his incompetence.</p>
<p>At any rate, to those Whites who say they will accept qualified blacks to save them from a burning building or operate on them, it should be pointed out that there is no way to know before the fact that a particular black is qualified. If you are recommended to have a surgery and the surgeon is black, you cannot know in advance just how qualified he or she may be. Sure, you can look at their medical school, residency training program, state licensure and even their surgical board certification, but each of these steps designed to qualify only the best and weed out the rest are impacted by the government- and culturally-enforced affirmative action programs. So, a black from Harvard Medical School, trained at the Harvard Hospital, licensed in New York, and certified by the American College of Surgery would seem to be well qualified, and you as a patient may be comfortable with him or her operating on you, but affirmative action has, at each step in the process, fudged a little to allow the barely qualified to move up the ladder. If you are one of the lucky ones who have a good operative outcome, you may feel that your surgeon was indeed qualified, and pass him along by word of mouth to the next patient. But if you do not survive, or have a very poor result, it is too late for you to complain that he or she is unqualified because he was an affirmative action surgeon.</p>
<p>The careful patient should still search out the educational experience and qualifications of White surgeons, since the certifying organizations obviously do not apply affirmative action criteria to White surgeons, and the prospective patient can be more assured of accuracy of White surgeons&rsquo;  qualifications.</p>
<p>I suspect that even a liberal, affirmative action loving left winger would rather not have Michelle Obama represent them as an attorney, despite her current public idolatry.</p>
<p>The point is that you cannot know which blacks are qualified simply because affirmative action prevents the weeding out of the unqualified. Therefore the only responsible action for Whites is to avoid all blacks in all professional situations. One should very carefully consider whether they wish to have a black attorney, physician, financial advisor, money manager, or nurse in a position of providing potentially life changing professional services to themselves or family members. For inconsequential things, such as screenwriting, popular music, acting, sports, jazz music you are in a much less dangerous position to accept affirmative action blacks, if you must, since in these situations, they can only take your money that you willingly give them, but they cannot have a more lasting consequence on your life.</p>

			<p>Our willingness to slaughter our fellow white man in two world wars has gone a long way in reducing our self respect, has it not?  I mean, if we were willing to fire bomb thousand year old European cities full of cultural artifacts, why would we be averse to committing genetic suicide sixty years later?  Better not confront the &#8220;greatest generation&#8221; with that one.</p>

			<p>There is so much to potentially comment on in this article.  But one item that stood out to me is all these White Hollywood scrpt writers.  These are the people responsible for the minority heavy movies and especially tv shows that have been assailing us at a growing rate for years.  These are the writers constantly paring up White females with Black males or other non-White males so as to be read as an attempt to shape society.</p>
<p>Steve Sailer may have inadventently identified the location and individuals that are making such an impact on our society.  I am willing to bet anything you like that the majority are not only White, but from middle class &#8220;Christian&#8221; homes.  A good strategy might be to figure out how to make race realists of these nerdy cartoon scripters.</p>
<p>Another notable point is one that I have written about often in posts, the latest time just yesterday.  Whites aren&rsquo;t unified because as the majority we compete with one another.  And we cannot shake of this sense of &#8220;I&rsquo;ve got mine, you can go **** yourself.&#8221;  Yesterday I tried to identify it as a sort of 19th century mindset with origins in antebellum American social and political resentments combined with the rush to claim everything from gold to open land.  This article further illustrated that idea and helps highlight the idea that Whites will have to become &#8220;other White supporting&#8221; in a White Socialist sense.  As I wrote yesterday, I would be glad to help a young White couple succeed, especially if they are committed to passing on their own racial heritage with pride.  This can only be done when all Whites in a given region see the need and strength given everyone in doing this.  </p>
<p>I often have mentioned the social system of Slovenia and the high sense of nationalism there.  Today I have a report from my good friend there who replied to my innquiry to say that Slovenia is still a nice place, not overrun with Muslims and Black Africans, etc.  Slovenia is a sort of Slavic Switzerland, but because it was once part of Yugoslavia it sort of frooze its mindset and still exists without very much of the damaging liberalism that has hurt Western Europe so much.  The one flaw I see is that they are a bit like a bunch of political leftist living in a gated community; They hold multicultural ideals, but do not practice them.  So far, they are succeeding in thinking of themselves as a progressive society without seeing their hypocracy.</p>
<p>But I wish that we could learn something from the Slovenian example.</p>

			<p>For Steve Sailer a score on a IQ tests represents some kind of unified theory of human kind.In Sailer&rsquo;s mind, everything is filtered through the score on an IQ tests.</p>
<p>I blieve that Sailer and his readers have a lot of contempt for those Native Born White Americans who are not part of the &#8220;cognitive elite&#8221;-whatever the hell this means beyond a score on an IQ test.</p>
<p>You can get a very good idea of what Sailer believes by what he leaves out in his blogs an essays. There is never any mention of the H-1  and L-1 B visa programs. Why is this? I think he does write about this because for him the natural order and constition of a  of a society is determined by a scsore on an IQ tests. &#8220;Marginal&#8221; White Males and the Native Born White victims of the H-1 b  and L-1 B programs aren&rsquo;t very important classes of people for Sailer. Or,to put it another way, Sailer does not have a strong sense of racial solidarity with his fellow White Americans.</p>

			<p>The key to understading Steve Sailer&rsquo;s aracialism is:1)he has a strong devotion to a top down corporate controlled society and belief that IQ scores are crucial to the efficient slotting of people within a brutal corporate controlled societe. There is no another way to organize a human society. I of course reject this. Everyone else here should also.</p>
<p>I beleive this explains The warm spot in Sailer&rsquo;s heart for post-1965 asians. The fact that they have greatly harmed thousands of &#8220;marginal&#8221; Native Born White familes means nothing to Sailer. This is the ket to understanding Sailer&rsquo;s silly notion of citizenship.</p>

			<p>John PM, Steve is talking about the elite, those at the highest levels of power in the media, law, politics, academia and business.  Among such people, concern about whites who are racially discriminated against is zero.  CEO&rsquo;s, writers for The Atlantic, Hollywood producers, Governors etc., simply don&rsquo;t care about it.</p>
<p>Steve is not endorsing this at all.  He is opposed to affirmative action.  He is merely explaining why there is no concern from elite whites about other whites who are discriminated against. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also interesting to note how affirmative action has been completely ignored by the GOP and mainstream conservative movement as of late.  None of the current conservative movements main constituents   &mdash;   Big Business, Neoconservatives and the Religious Right   &mdash;   really care much about this issue.  As recently as the mid 90&rsquo;s, it was a major issue for conservatives.  </p>

			<p>The only way to reverse or halt the damage that&rsquo;s been done to our society from the race revolution of the 1960s into the present is to get more Western elites to value their own civilization. <br>
Most people with elite Ivy League educations selfishly limit their sympathies only to their own kind. Carleton Putnam (Princeton graduate) and Jared Taylor (Yale graduate) are the only Americans with elite educations that have had the soul, insight and sense of responsibility to expand their sympathies to the plight of the majority. </p>
<p>Any advancement in protecting the West will have to be a top down effort. I don&rsquo;t have much faith in populists movements because the elites, with their control of media and public opinion, (not to mention corrupt law enforcement), can quash any such movements with ease. A real movement takes quality leadership.  <br>

I would hope that if ever I needed surgery or to be rescued from a burning building, it would be one of my own kind who did so&hellip;  I don&rsquo;t care if the whole world knows it or not:  When I need a new dentist, eye dr., or whatever, I do a little research to see if he&rsquo;s white, and have done for years.  I&rsquo;d bet a lot of people do!  Maybe only subconsciously, but still, I&rsquo;d bet they do!  </p>

			<p>Xenophon above makes a very good point, but I would go one step further: The critical mass of the White Intelligentsia was killed off during those fratricidal/suicidal wars known as WWI &amp; WWII.</p>
<p>After those meat grinders perhaps the White Man and his culture don&rsquo;t deserve to survive?  It is certainly my belief that unless and until the lies propagated about about those conflicts, nothing will change because the &#8216;powers that be&rsquo; continue to hide behind that curtain of lies, and continue to use them as a sales tool to sell their policies of endless wars to the tax payer.</p>

			<p>The Sailer site has the persistent feel of a bunch of intelligent, mild mannered guys exchanging un-PC notes at the water cooler and self consciously tittering over their own naughtiness. &#8220;Did you see this chart? It shows blacks have lower IQs than whites.&#8221; Then the Asian buddy from three cubicles down walks over, and the white group says, &#8220;Psst, guess what Asians are smarter than blacks too. Get a look at this and don&rsquo;t tell Shaniquia in Accounting! Tee, hee.&#8221; </p>
<p>There is a sense of physical security and frivolity to their banter. They are token rebels against their own Flower Child generation, who grew up in orderly and secure conditions of widespread prosperity where experimenting with sex and drugs was about as &#8220;risky&#8221; as life got. They can&rsquo;t imagine any other world. </p>
<p>Sailerites are very different from the Korean War era generation whose parents had a living memory of poverty and hunger and violence. Men like Clint Eastwood&rsquo;s character in &#8220;Gran Torino,&#8221; who know what men look like with body parts missing understand the world differently than their pampered Vietnam protester children or even more self absorbed and clueless grandchildren. </p>
<p>I think some of the Sailerites have a feeling that their safe, familiar water cooler is standing at the edge of a precipice, and they refuse to look down. Southern California is a dangerous place to be a white person these days, and it will get much worse the instant Schwartzenegger makes good on his proposal to cut welfare entitlements to the brown majority. The economy is worse than what the talking heads are presenting to us. </p>
<p>God help us all, every color, because we fools might need guidance from our Creator sooner than we think. </p>

<p>Big business is just ahead of government and second only to Academia in their promotion of affirmative action. Their official policy and their mission statements are all-go for AA. Obviously it&rsquo;s just another lie. The diversity managers they have to hire cost real money - even if a &#8216;diverse&rsquo; workforce actually does better work, which doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case, as where there is the most diversity, ie, all black, all hispanic, all female, there is not always the most production.</p>

			<p>That is the point Mr. Sailer consistently misses, when he is discussing the racial spoils system-USA; for every glibly unconcerned white like him, there are probably at a minimum 5 to 10 who harbor the angst and anger that I do about the travesty of forced multicultural &ldquo;equality.&rdquo;</p>

			<p><i>The hard fact of the matter is that &ldquo;marginal whites&rdquo; are probably brighter than 90% of blacks. And I would take a &ldquo;marginal white&rdquo; before a marginal black. The marginal white is our people, the marginal black is not.</i></p>
<p>The hard fact of the matter is that marginal whites will produce smarter children than elite blacks or mestizos (regression to the mean).  I hope this meme becomes fixed in the race-realist population (at least) soon.</p>
<p>The hard fact is, marginal whites will produce children WHOSE INTERESTS ARE ALIGNED WITH the children of elite whites, something non-whites of any caliber cannot do.</p>
<p>Elite whites are bound by the culture of critique (Sailer has stated he thinks that culture is hunkey-dorey); this means that if elite whites want to stay that way, they don&rsquo;t rock the boat.  So, I guess we&rsquo;re discussing sub-elites now, rather than real elites, no?</p>

<p>I disagree.  I think an elite will NEVER stick up for a populace that won&rsquo;t stick up for itself.  People are primarily self-serving.  If those harmed by a policy won&rsquo;t oppose it, no one will, especially not those served by it.  Think of it as leaders and followers; each needs the other.  Right now, the leaders are getting what they want, and the followers aren&rsquo;t.  Time for an accounting and subsequent negotiations, I think.</p>
<p>These things are organic.  If enough followers show up, leaders will &#8220;magically&#8221; show up to lead them.  But I don&rsquo;t like the odds of leaders showing up without any followers to lead.  The great thing about this is that leaders are whores.  They&rsquo;d get over their distaste for any given political position in about a nanosecond if you make the gravy rich enough.</p>
<p>So, for the umpteenth time, the circle is complete and we&rsquo;re again looking at who controls our social nervous system (AKA the media, AKA the first estate, AKA the most powerful industry in the world, bar none).</p>

			<p>Among the many excellent posts on this article, I have to agree with Xenophone&rsquo;s short summation, that is actually a small part of John PM&rsquo;s point, as well as Dedalus&rsquo;s. The insane butchery between whites, involved in the two world wars, as well as the American Civil War, was beyond a catastrophe. The after effects are still with us. Xenophone states that the greatest generation had best not be confronted with this. Interestingly enough, I have talked to many of that generation, and with the passage of time and the events that have occured, some have actually taken a broader view of their experience. Sadly tho, there are those who went to their graves, never having realized the ultimate impact and meaning of it all, where their own kind was concerned. It is as if the history of white peoples, compared to other races, has been a gigantic struggle between Titans who vied for power among themselves, others being totally irrelevant to their many wars.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll start off by stating I&rsquo;m Jewish to diffuse any potential problems that might arise from my post. I&rsquo;m sure most people are aware of how disingenuous this article is in many respects. I work for one of the Hollywood studios and the part of this article I have a pet peeve with is the author mentioning screenwriters and inferring that Hollywood discriminates against blacks. Considering the low numbers of blacks who actually submit work, you&rsquo;d be surprised that there are as many black screenwriters as there are, especially in TV. I also have to state that the studios do favor my fellow Jews first and foremost over everyone. Call me a self hater, but it&rsquo;s a fact. The guys who have the toughest time in screenwriting are white males. I hate to admit that many Jewish executives will pass up hiring very good, extremely talented white guys if they can hire a Jewish guy instead. If the Jewish guy is mediocre, he&rsquo;ll be helped along as much as possible. A lot of the non-Jewish white writers here in Hollywood are guys who became friends with Jews while attending Ivy League schools. No, there&rsquo;s no anti-white or anti-American conspiracy at the studio where I&rsquo;m employed. It has more to do with the ridiculous liberal attitudes and basically communist beliefs driven into the brains of so many of my fellow Jews while growing up. Their parents and grandparents here in the US still sometimes act as if they&rsquo;re in 19th century shtetles. Believe me, a lot of &#8220;us&#8221; know what&rsquo;s going on and we&rsquo;re as irritated over it as other whites are. White Pride should be &#8220;cool&#8221; and whites should be valued for the achievements they&rsquo;ve accomplished that have benefitted all of mankind. This bogeyman thinking against whites has to stop. </p>

			<p>I have had more than my fill of Affirmative Action, with its direct impact on me, and other good friends.</p>
<p>As an example, I had taken a Civil Service exam, and scored 95% on the written test. I placed first on the list. I then had to report for a full medical exam,which I had passed with no problem. Then I had to undergo a Psyhcological exam. Again, I had passed that without a problem. </p>
<p>Later that month, after having an Interview, and being &#8220;Offered&#8221; the job, I was waiting to receive my appointment letter and start date in the mail. It never came, so I decided to call the Civil Service Commission. The woman that I spoke to stated that there was a &#8220;Hiring Freeze&#8221; for the position I was hired for. </p>
<p>Well, I have a friend whose wife worked in the Civil Service Commission, and she told me that a Black was hired in my place, even though there was a &#8220;Hiring Freeze&#8221; on at the time. </p>
<p>Sure, there was a Freeze. They were freezing the most qualified Candidate out of the chance to obtain gainful employment, with respect to my credentials, background, and test scores. </p>
<p>This, of course,is not the first time that this has happened to me, or to other White males, either in Civil Service, Union Jobs, or in Corporate positions.  </p>
<p>Of course, if you wanted to hire an Attorney that specialized in Civil Service law, the filing, and his fees, at the begining, would be $5,000.00. Who has that kind of money to lay out, on something that could go either way? So, I walked away from it. </p>
<p>The Cities deserve to put Blacks in all the top spots, whether they be in the Fire Department, Police, Corrections, or Sanitation. If anyone thinks that Cities are unlivable now, wait until the Coloreds get all the top jobs. They will run the Cities further into the ground, that they will resemble Zimbabwe, or Haiti.</p>

			<p>Almost by definition whites at the top have avoided affirmative action cuts. They may not have a lot of personal experience with it on the other end.. Also, the work environment could be expected to be better for high achievers too. You can&rsquo;t expect a lot of sensitivity from them, even during &#8216;sensitivity&rsquo; training week. </p>

			<p>&#8220;No, there&rsquo;s no anti-white or anti-American conspiracy at the studio where I&rsquo;m employed.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even worse sometimes, isn&rsquo;t it, when it&rsquo;s not like an officially mandated policy yet the outcome is the same if not even more so. Of course those are the places that don&rsquo;t actually have &#8216;sensitivity&rsquo; programing.   </p>

			<p>The Russian goverment and the other Eurpean goverments fell because of at loss of support at the bottom. People in these contries simply stopped obeying. When a critcal number of Native Born White Born Americans start thinking about things differently tings the game will be over.</p>
<p>Catastrophic events will be an inducement to think about things differently.</p>

			<p>What Steve Sailer is doing in this article is engaging in a bit of self-satisfaction.  Like the kind of &#8220;I&rsquo;ve got mine, nuts to you.&#8221; mentality that we saw a lot of in the 80&rsquo;s.  That never went away in fact, it just was replaced by other culture fads that took the spotlight. But it&rsquo;s never left the stage, so to speak.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s worth point out that Self-Satisfaction, that brutal middle-class indulgence, is above all else, the number one reason we are in the position we&rsquo;re in today. I wonder if he&rsquo;s ever thought about that.  Perhaps he has.  One time in particular Sailer dismissed a genuine and legitimate concern from a person in the Letters section at VDARE with a rudeness and arrogance that was shockingly stupid, given our situation.  Since no one is perfect, and Steve isn&rsquo;t stupid, I chalked it up to appallingly bad manners.  A lack of social deftness, something he shares with Brenda Walker.<br>

			<p>Lots of posts here have hit the nail on the head with Sailer, and, indirectly, not just him. <br>
The combination of snottiness and indifference is one of the the reasons why – important as these websites are – they, unfortunately, amount to what I refer to as the &ldquo;Look What They Are Doing To Us Now!&rdquo; websites.  <br>
High on Diagnonsis, most of it brilliant, and Low on Solutions.  <br>
This is a big - BIG - problem and I think the reason is few if any have given consideration as to what our Society would look like and how we would live together should we, by some miracle, ever win our Country back.</p>
<p>As Patrick Cleburne, of VDARE, said recently, &#8220;We need everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>In any event, that Would be an interesting thing to write about on these sites.  Something like,<br>
&#8220;So Exactly What Kind Of Country Do You Want Anyway?&#8221;  Or, What&rsquo;s Your Vision Of A Future Worth Living In?&#8221;<br>
I think it would do much to inspire Individuals and energize Group activity.<br>

			<p>To concerned Jewish Guy:  I agree with you.  I&rsquo;m part Jewish, but I loathe white guilt, loathe seeing the west being taken over by non-whites who are hostile to us and our way of life.  If it&rsquo;s racist for non-jewish white males to look out for their own, then jewish people (like Tim Wise, for example) should be fair and not exclude themselves from other groups.  </p>

			<p>Let me rephrase it this why:The Republican and Democratic beltway consensus requires the consent of a critical number of Native Born White Americans. Without this consent it would crumble. To be even more specific:a critical number of Native Born White Americans continue to vote Republican. Without this support, the corpes of the Republican party would finally be thrown into the town dump with the rest of the rotting garbage. When this happens, events will move ahead very fast. Peter Brimelow is foolish-and anybody else- to attempt. to revive the Republican party.</p>
<p>The revolt against race-replacement at the hands of post-1965 asians,hispanics,muslims and africans has to be uncompromising and complete. Nothing short of reversing the situation to where it was before the passage of the 1965 immigration refrom act should be acceptable. We are moving into very very dangerous territory very rapidly.</p>
<p>If the ecological conciousness of a critical number of Native Born White Americans was much higher, the White racial conciousness would be much higher..right into the red zone. Running away and secession will not solve the problem.Ultimately the US population will explode way above a billion..mostly non-white and there will be a population collapse within the nation formely known as America.. a combination of exponentially growth in the non-white areas and and an increase in the White fertility in the White areas makes this inevitable with 100 percent certainty. </p>

<p>Great Post!!!!</p>
<p>I know alot of people on both sides disagree with me; but, Whites - those who identify as Jewish, Or European-American, Christian, Gentile, etc. - need each other and should work together, even putting some issues on pause until we have a society we want to live in and discuss them in a civil manner.<br>
We ought to work together and I was encouraged by the Western Civilization meeting in Baltimore held not so long ago.</p>
<p>Our common ground meets at a number of points - but the only one we really need now is Freedom of Speech.</p>

			<p>We need to hire professional public relations people to teach us the right words and approach.  The multi-cultis know how to use language to put us on the defensive, we have to do it against them.</p>
<p>The multi-cultis like to tell us that in 40 years time, the country will be 50%  non white. They do this to make us feel like it is inevitable and that it is useless to resist.  We need to put the question back to them - after 40 years then what?  Will they stop immigration from predominately nonwhite countries then?  Of course they won&rsquo;t and by that time the nonwhite groups will be so politically powerful that there will be no stopping them from contining flood country with their relatives.  So after 40 years time, the white population will shrink to 45%, then 40%, then 30% etc.  Ask the multi-cultis about this and see what they say.  They will of course lie, fudge and use evasive tactics.  This is when we can pin them down.  Ask them what THEY think the ethnic balance should be.  This would put them on the spot, which is what they always try to do to us.  </p>
<p>Other things that we can do: we can complain about the large numbers of immigrants that are coming into the country.  We can make this a jobs issue.  This can have an effect on Democrats because they always talk about protecting jobs.  If you live in a Democrat area, tell your politicians that you will never vote Democrat until they stop flooding the country with cheap labor immigrants, and you can throw in illegal aliens.  Let them know that you know that the Democrats are encouraging illegals to come here.  Tell them that they will have to choose between your real vote or a theoretical future vote of the illegals.</p>
<p>As far refugee resettlement, again contact your mayor, city council, state senate and representatives and governor. Also go to the federal level and notify your senators and representative that you do not want any more of these ill chosen refugee programs.  Tell them that there is no need for all the world refugees to come here. Tell them that it would be better if they were resettled in another part of their own country.  Try the nimby approach - not-in-my-backyard.  This will shake them up.</p>

			<p>Just a little nit picking here about screen writing being a cool job.</p>
<p>It is also just about the easiest writing job around.  It&rsquo;s easier than doing a 10 page high school term paper, especially with word processing.  40 years ago screen writers had to know how to type and set tabs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really easy and amusing and enjoyable. Stallone knocked out the script of Rocky 1 in three days using pen and paper and then a typewriter.</p>
<p>Selling a script is a whole nother story.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Of course, if you wanted to hire an Attorney that specialized in Civil Service law, the filing, and his fees, at the begining, would be $5,000.00. Who has that kind of money to lay out, on something that could go either way? So, I walked away from it. &#8220;</p>
<p>Legal ethics prohibit an attorney from taking on a case he can&rsquo;t win. Even if there were no ethical and professional concerns, attorneys almost never take on cases they cannot win. Nobody works for nothing.</p>
<p>So basically there are no attorneys who will take on a civil rights case for a White. They will lose.  Their client may or may not be able to pay the fees and expenses.</p>
<p>Speaking of the civil service commission.  </p>
<p>A black woman I worked with told me that the State was giving an exam for Parole Officer.  Since I had been a Probation Officer for 12 years I had the necessary experience (2 years).  So I called and asked that the exam be sent.  I was told, you have to come down in person for it.  </p>
<p>I went down in person and was told. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not giving the exam at this time.&#8221;  I left and walked down the street.  I noticed Heald business college.  I noticed a large number of young people waiting at the bus stop outside the college. I approached a respectable looking young black man and asked him if he would like to make $20.00 in 15 minutes.  I explained what I wanted him to do.  He agreed.</p>
<p>We walked back to the Civil Service Commission building.  He went to the counter and asked for the Parole Officer Exam.  The clerk handed it to him, along with another sheet detailing times and places for the special tutoring classes to prepare for the exam.  </p>
<p>He gave me the papers.  I gave him the $20.00.</p>
<p>Just one more example of the discrimination against Whites.</p>
<p>Our government is just about 90 percent staffed with incompetent blacks and non White immigrants.  I hope I live long enough to see the entire edifice crash down.</p>

			<p>I hate to admit that many Jewish executives will pass up hiring very good, extremely talented white guys if they can hire a Jewish guy instead. If the Jewish guy is mediocre, he&rsquo;ll be helped along as much as possible. </p>

<p>Concerned Jewish Guy I heard from many, many sources that many non Jews were considering suing Jerry Seinfield and Larry David for discrimination in favor of Jews when they were doing the Seinfield show.  Is this true? </p>

			<p>To Anonymous at 11:51 AM on May 24, your remark about Tim Wise is all too true. As a Jew, he embarrasses me with his hypocrisy. He rants about whites but of course, he himself is above white racism. He is actually one of the most racist social commentators out there. He is merely a con man who has figured out an angle he can use to make easy money. It&rsquo;s very easy right now to stand up on a podium and bash whites. He and other hypocrites act as if they&rsquo;re being courageous, but actually their lies and attitudes are supported by the media at large. It&rsquo;s courageous to stand up for whites because you will be vilified. What Tim Wise engages in is transparent hypocrisy, cowardice and greed. </p>
<p>Steve Sailer can write interesting articles once in a while but he only goes so far. He&rsquo;s not as courageous as he tries to make himself out to be.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what I thought about Wise!  Why aren&rsquo;t the majority of whites chasing him out of town and not letting him come to their universities and organizations to speak?  It&rsquo;s funny he talks about &#8220;white privilege&#8221; and yet he, as you said, is using his white skin to bash whites and, because it&rsquo;s easy as you said, he&rsquo;s privileged in that he has the MSM and most other people who won&rsquo;t criticize him for bashing whites.  Are there lots of people out there who are exposing this fraud?</p>
