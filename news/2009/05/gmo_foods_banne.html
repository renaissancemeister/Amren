<h1>GMO Foods Banned .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As Nation Starves</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pindai Dube, The Zimbabwean, May 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Zimbabwe&rsquo;s main consumer rights group, the Consumer Council of Zimbabwe (CCZ), has started raiding shops and supermarkets found selling Genetically Modified Foods (GMO) on grounds that it is unhealthy.</p>
<p>Most supermarkets and shops in the country&rsquo;s biggest cities are flooded with GMO foods imported from South Africa and Brazil as local industries are still struggling to find their feet after a decade-long economic crisis.</p>
<p>President Robert Mugabe is blamed for pursuing ill-advised economic policies that impacted on all sectors of the economy. Most industries were forced to close shop or relocate to neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>As a result of the failure of local businesses, companies from neighbouring countries have flooded the local market, stockpiling shops and supermarkets with imported foods.</p>
<p>According to the CCZ, this has allowed GMO foods into the shops and supermarkets. CCZ which fights for the rights of consumers last week started to inspect and recommend that shops selling GMO foods should be closed.</p>
<p>CCZ said the GMO foods which have flooded Zimbabwewere mostly powered milk, meal- mealie, rice and chicken.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have received a lot of reports of people, mainly children, getting sick after consuming the foods which in most cases will be expired,&#8221; said Comfort Muchekeza, the CCZ spokesperson. &#8220;We have raided and closed several shops and supermarkets in Bulawayo for selling expired GMO foods. We are working with the health ministry to bar GMO foods from entering the country. The health ministry has mounted check-up points at the country&rsquo;s borders to inspect foodstuffs coming to into the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zimbabwe has a long-standing policy against GMO food on the grounds of human safety and the potential threat that GMO crop contamination could pose for the local environment. But with over three million of people facing famine, in 2002 the Mugabe government agreed to accept GMO maize from the United States on the condition that it was milled.</p>
<p><b>ZIMRA tax rampage</b></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC) has blasted the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) for raiding flea markets and shops saying the move scared away investors.</p>
<p>In the past three weeks, ZIMRA has been on rampage, confiscating goods on grounds of unpaid tax.</p>
<p>Addressing businesspeople in Bulawayo on Thursday ZNCC President, Obert Sibanda, said the government should stop ZIMRA officials from harassing businesspeople.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are being harassed night and day by ZIMRA officials, we have no peace. This scares away any potential investors at a time when the country badly needs investment to lift the economy,&#8221; said Sibanda.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t quite get this fear of &#8220;genetically modified&#8221; food that seems to cause so much distress these days.</p>
<p>ALL foods are genetically modified, due to the long process of domestication.</p>
<p>Present-day tomatoes, apples, wheat, among many others, look nothing like their wild ancestors. The &#8220;natural&#8221; strains from which our crops sprung tend to be scrawny and yield much less per acre. In the case of corn, domestication has proceeded so thoroughly that the original plant has long been extinct.</p>
<p>Some cultivated plants have twice, four times, or even six times as many sets of chromosomes as wild &#8220;natural&#8221; ones (polyploidy). These &#8220;genetically modified&#8221; plants are stronger, taller, more floriferous and more productive than those with the &#8220;natural&#8221; amount of chromosomes.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t mentioned the vast changes in animal species as a result of domestication (don&rsquo;t waste your time trying to find a herd of Guernsey cows or a pack of toy poodles anywhere in nature).</p>
<p>Environmentalism is a pet cause of Western White people with too much time and too much money on their hands. It does no good for starving African Blacks suffering at the hands of a corrupt &#8220;Big Man&#8221;, as in this case of Zimbabwe.<br>

<p>On the condition? Have they heard the expression &#8220;beggars can&rsquo;t be choosy&#8221;? Obviously not. GMO or not, they(the government) ought to be happy with what they get. They are the cause of the starvation.</p>

		<p>Three points</p>
<p>1. I actually agree with the Zimbabweans here. I think we should stop sending free or cheap subsidized foodstuffs to Africa. The problem with aid is if they are giving food away for free it obviously undercuts local farmers.  Since Africans are doomed to technological backwardness probably till the end of time, farming and perhaps mining are their only real profitable industries. Sending food to Africa turns all Africans into welfare dependent beggars.</p>
<p>2.Also starvation is a natural and necessary in Africa were having 5-10 children is considered normal. If if overpopulation gets bad enough and the environment becomes overtaxed with things like water and farmland becoming scarce you tend to have these Darfur/Rawanda/congo style genocides. Pick your Poison, starvation or  the machete. </p>
<p>3. As far as the GMO concerns go, I think the results have pretty conclusively proven that GMO crops are as safe as organic crops or &#8220;normal&#8221; plants and animals. In the western world farmers have basically been &#8220;genetically modifiying&#8221; crops and livestock for centuries anyway by selectively breeding the most bountiful plants and the most desirable cows, sheep etc. Now we can just speed up the process. </p>
<p>When I was in college in the early part of the decades it was a huge issue on campus, the issue of &#8220;Frankenfoods&#8221; as they called them. I recall activists widely predicting mutant genetically modified plants and farm animals would wreak untold havoc on the earth which never came to pass or they would kill large numbers of consumers somehow. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if leftists are still throwing tantrums over this issue or they have admitted they were wrong yet. <br>

		<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t matter what kind of seeds Zimbabwe uses. They exterminated all the talented (white) farmers that ran the commercial farms that made Rhodesia a net food exporter, and those farms are now property of illiterate thugs (&#8220;war veterans&#8221;) who just sold off the farming equipment to buy weapons to kill off their rival gangs or tribes or whatever it is they have in this place.</p>

<p>Reason Magazine Online seized on this quote to ask whether people became sick because the food was genetically modified or (more likely) it was past its sell-by date.</p>
<p>I sure don&rsquo;t remember mass starvation when Ian Smith was in charge&hellip;</p>

		<p>Zimbabwe, formally White Rhodesia, has forced White Farmers of their land, that they have been farming for 400 years. Those Whites that did not want to leave their farms were killed, under the Mugabe Government. </p>
<p>Now, Zimbabwe, like formally White South Africa, which both used to export surplus food, starves, because the Blacks, that got the land from the Whites, don&rsquo;t know how to farm.</p>
<p>These Black idiots make their own problems. Let them figure it out themselves. They thought that they were so damned smart, taking the White Farmers&rsquo; lands, but all they managed to do is put their Country into a Famine. </p>

		<p>Mike NY: Selective breeding and traditional agriculture is not the same thing as what Monsonto does as far as splicing genes goes. Although I am not aware of any evidence that GMO&rsquo;s are bad for you health-wise, many GMO&rsquo;s are engineered in such a way that makes you dependent on the company to maintain your crops and there are legal issues as well that are associated with GMO&rsquo;s (such as when GMO seed drifts into an innocent farmer&rsquo;s crops).</p>
<p>I think aj has it right on the money here. </p>
<p>Zimbabwe doesn&rsquo;t need our technology; in the long run it hurts them by making them perpetually dependent on the intellectual gifts of whites to keep them alive. When something catastrophic happens to us and they stop receiving food aid, it will be a huge catastrophe for them as their artifically sustained population collapses.</p>

		<p>Theres a difference between benign GMO food, such as hens genetically engineered to make eggs with omega-3 oils, and malignant GMO food, such as the roundup resistant stuff pushed by Monsanto. The latter is pure bile and its use is strongly correlated with massive drops of the local bee population which negatively affects all other plants. </p>

		<p>I agree with the Zimbabweans myself. GMO&rsquo;s are not like other foods or hybrids. These are foods with genetic material from other organisms. That could be snakes, buffalo, butterflies whatever. We do not even know how / if we can ingest some of this stuff. GMO&rsquo;s have been pulled off the market before for injuring people. </p>
<p>This is not just a leftist problem. We are now breeding new versions of weeds / pests that are resistant to our current methods of fighting them in part to GMO&rsquo;s. Some are begining to think the destruction of our bee populations are do in part to GMO&rsquo;s.<br>

		<p>The real issue facing us here is not GMO but rather the inability of black Africans in Zimbabwe to cultivate enough food to feed themselves.  When whites were responsible for agriculture in Rhodesia, the country was known as the breadbasket of Africa, and exported huge quantities of foodstuffs throughout the African continent.</p>
<p>As absolutely invariably happens when blacks gain control of anything, be it a town, a state, a country, an economy, or a government, they destroy it utterly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s simply no point in exporting food to Zimbabwe. </p>

GMF connection to bees is wrong (See below) or it would be an ever increasing problem. </p>
<p>Have the Eco nuts ever been right? What happened to the deforestation of the Northeast through Acid Rain? Wups! How about that Ozone Hole killing us all? Wups! How about the Alar on Apples in the NorthWest? Wrong! Man made Global Cooling/Global Warming/Climate Change? Wups! Oil killing the Oceans? Nope. GMF toxic? Unmm no. Oil pipline destroying the moose? No. The list of chicken little scenarios I have seen just in my life time exceeds this page allowance. All wrong.</p>
<p>How about this, if the Zimbabweans want to give back the land to the White Farmers with Reparations for their suffering, maybe enough would listen to come back to feed their starving masses, but I wouldn&rsquo;t hold my breath. Socialists never, never, never admit they are wrong even unto death. </p>
<p>As to the bee problem; From an Eco Freak site: </p>
<p>&#8220;The good news is 75% of US beekeepers have actually never noticed a problem with their hives. Among the remaining 25% who have reported some apparent CCD like symptoms, the severity of the problem has ranged anywhere from a slight reduction in the number of workers to complete collapse of the hive. Many of these apiary operations have been through CCD and recovered, which suggests that resistance may be growing within the bee population.</p>

		<p>As long as we&rsquo;re talking about eco-freaks and environmentalists, if you press one of them long enough on the issue, most of them will admit that third world population growth is the number one threat to the environment. White nations have industrialized and experienced population stabilization (to excess unfortunately) which is the prerequisite for any successful environmental protection policy. As long as the average African woman has 6 or 7 children there is no hope for dear &#8220;mother Africa.&#8221;</p>

<p>ALL foods are genetically modified, due to the long process of domestication.&#8221;</p>
<p>I get it.  We&rsquo;re not talking about selective breeding of plants to produce a superior strain, we&rsquo;re talking about splicing genes from worms, spiders, pigs, etc. into corn, tomatoes and other crops.  It&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;d want to ingest in my body<br>
and no one really knows the long term effects of consuming these crops or how it might alter the long term evolution of these plants.</p>

		<p>There is always many who claim a superior opinion, when in fact, no one&rsquo;s OPINION is better than anyone else&rsquo;s. However, when arguing science, that is a different matter.<br>
GMO foods - like those produced by Monsanto, do cause cancer. Hybrid plants obviously are not included in this group, which were started hundreds of years ago. Genetic testing on plants, such as Monsanto&rsquo;s - were tested in Europe, thoroughly. Europe does not allow import of GMO foods for this reason. Africa was the same way, but apparently have bent under political pressure to accept GMO donations (from the US). <br>
Now, regarding the &#8216;starving african&rsquo; issue that we have seen for decades now, maybe one day a few of them will realize it is nearly impossible to survive in a desert climate. If not, they will continue to die.<br>
Back to the GMO, it is in your food, your soda, your milk, your meat. If you didn&rsquo;t grow it, you&rsquo;re eating cancer causing GMO foods. enjoy. or you can just claim &#8216;intelligent ignorance&rsquo; like those above and pretend- that will make us all feel warm and cozy inside.<br>
here is one example :<br>

if you can spell GMO, you should be able to find your own studies on the internet.</p>

		<p>I do believe natural foods free of dyes, hormones, preservatives and etc. are the best and healthiest and many chemicals today in our foods do lead to greater obesity or disease. However, GMO foods are far superior to starving. Since Zimm leaders kicked out the White farmers and ruined the country&rsquo;s economy, the leaders are wrong not to accept GMO foods which would keep the populace from starving.</p>

<p>This is absolutely hilarious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure snakes and rats are on their menu, because the entire black population is without any means of support; besides that&rsquo;ve been the main fare on their menu anyway, yet it&rsquo;s as if they have to start worrying about getting fat and have the advatage of selecting only the best available.  Isn&rsquo;t this also considered delusional?</p>
<p>Is this another blaring example of black inability to run a civilization?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought many times that I wouldn&rsquo;t expect blacks to take up arms to fight for an abstract cause, simply because they could never embrace anything they couldn&rsquo;t understand, but I&rsquo;m  a little mystified as to why whites haven&rsquo;t taken over by arming themselves and using their god-given ability for exceptional planning and military tactics, since the government is ripe for takeover.</p>
<p>Then it occurred to me that there was really nothing to takeover.  At present it&rsquo;s the same as a bombed out city where ownership and control would gain the victor nothing but problems and a whole lot of debris.</p>
<p>I wonder what it&rsquo;s like living in a country that might have a tornado completely level everything, yet still only cause about a hundred dollars worth of damage.</p>
