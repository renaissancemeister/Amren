<h1>Youth of Color Dying Weekly in Chicago</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sean Yoes, AFRO (Washington, D.C.), May 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Alex Arellano, a 15-year-old Chicago teen, was beaten, burned, shot in the head and his body was dumped in an alley last week, the latest of dozens of Chicago children and teens murdered in Chicago already this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arellano is one of 36 teens and children killed this year, a rate of more than one youth per week, a fact that has community leaders looking for answers.</p>
<p>But some claim the deaths have garnered little attention because the vast majority of the young people have been black and Hispanic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But, because violence is snuffing out the young lives, Pfleger [the Rev. Michael Pfleger] said, &#8220;We&rsquo;re hiding it. We&rsquo;re ignoring it. We&rsquo;re denying the problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chicago Police Superintendent Jody Weis said scuffles among young people have become increasingly violent and in the last couple of years many of the conflicts have ended in gunfire.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s simply too many gangs, too many guns and too many drugs on the streets,&#8221; Weis told CNN. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve got a problem with some of our young people who are resorting to the use of weapons and violence to solve any type of conflicts they may have.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Mayor Daley cites gangs, guns and drugs, but won&rsquo;t cite the most obvious factor, that being race.</p>
<p>The other big bromide is abandoned buildings, but there is nothing of the sight of an abandoned building that has ever made me want to commit a crime.   </p>
<p>Also, I and other posters have already stated the case for gangs as a problem being overstated.  And what is it about Chicagograd and other big cities that make guns behave so badly?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Minority&#8221; violence and murder is one of the great racial conundrums of the modern era. At once, if one makes too much noise about it, or points out the racial component of both victim and perp alike, it becomes just too obvious and unavoidable that this is solely an issue &#8220;of color,&#8221; if you will. At the same time, the usual suspects(as in the article) moan about the alleged lack of attention and fuss made about this appalling behavior. </p>
<p>When all is said and done, Whites do not react to it largely because we have simply grown to expect it! Here in New York, the nightly newscasts feature a daily tally of (mostly)murdered non-Whites and their non-White killers. For forty years I have witnessed these reports and only the totals change a bit here and there. Those responsible never change&hellip;</p>

<p>Hmm&hellip; maybe this is getting so little attention because this is a common act for these minorities? Oh, of course not. Blame whitey for the violence.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;But some claim the deaths have garnered little attention because the vast majority of the young people have been black and Hispanic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How utterly, if also sadly and darkly, laughable!</p>
<p>The Reds who run our media, seem appallingly perplexed as to how to cover the issue of black and Hispanic violence, be it of the intraracial or interracial varieties. They just cannot bring themselves to admit that such &ldquo;enriching youths,&rdquo; are causing violence in such bountiful extremes, that even they themselves are now the victims of it by: &ldquo;a rate of more than one youth per week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, as is indicated above in this article by Comrade Yoes, &ldquo;racism&rdquo; is the cause of it all. However, were it not for &ldquo;racism&rdquo; hindering their proclivities, might not these wondrous and necessary nonwhite &ldquo;youths&rdquo; simply exterminate themselves in an auto-genocide?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

			<p>As in Los Angeles, blacks and Hispanics in Chicago are killing each other. They blame gangs, drugs and easy access to weapons, but the problem is racial animosity. But they can&rsquo;t say it out loud in public. I&rsquo;d laugh if it weren&rsquo;t so horrifying.</p>

			<p>Last week the annoying Father Pfleger hung an American flag upside down outside his church to protest the murdering of &#8220;youth of color&#8221;. Someone tore it down. A Chicago talk radio station discussed this event. Two Chicago cops who&rsquo;d patrolled Pfleger&rsquo;s mostly black and brown neighbourhood phoned in and said violent crimes occur there regularly, but that no one helps the police catch the perpetrators. </p>

			<p>Fr Phlegler is a real hypocrite here.  A couple of years ago, he threatened to assassinate firearms dealers.  Cardinal George had to come out and say that his statement in that stead (and a couple others he made) weren&rsquo;t in the spirit of the Viceroy.  Which was the duh of the year.</p>

<i>&#8220;I was watching a CNN program on TV about this. They never once mentioned the issue of race. &#8220;</i></p>
<p>I watched a CNN panel discussion on this and it was ALL about race in that &#8216;this would never be allowed to happen in a white community&rsquo;. It was the unanimous consensus of the blacks on the panel.</p>
<p>Ya know, I hate that line of twisted, absurd black &#8216;reasoning&rsquo;; that somehow this doesn&rsquo;t happen in white communities because the authorities care about white people and they wouldn&rsquo;t dream of letting white people kill each other like this.</p>
<p>The FACT is this DOESN&rsquo;T happen in white communities. Not because the &#8216;powers that be&rsquo; don&rsquo;t permit it but because white people DON&rsquo;T KILL EACH OTHER at these rates.</p>
<p>This is one way blacks try to place the blame on whites. &#8216;It&rsquo;s not our fault blacks are killing blacks. It&rsquo;s the white mans&rsquo; fault because he LETS it happen in black communities&rsquo;.</p>
<p>For the record, <b>I AM NOT responsible for black behavior.</b> I never have been and I never will be. </p>
<p>Blacks expect white people to solve the problems blacks create. THEY create they hell they inhabit.<br>

			<p>These Chicago homicides are simply a built-in birth control program for &#8220;youths of color.&#8221; 99% of the victims are gang members and other lowlifes who would breed additional specimens of their own kind. Their deaths make a slight decrease in the future criminal gene pool.</p>

			<p>  I am a chicagoian. It is black and hispanic school kids that are being killed. No whites. They are also being killed outside of school. The schools are safe because the gang members are usually sleeping during school hours.<br>
   I blame the mayor, Richard Michael Daley, for this. His father brought in the blacks, he brought in the mexicans.<br>
   If Father Flaky cared about the children, he would walk into the mayor&rsquo;s office and demand the mayor&rsquo;s immediate resignation. He won&rsquo;t, because he is a coward,  but that would solve the gang problem.  His successor would do everything to get rid of the gangs.<br>
   We never worried about snow until the news media hounded Michael Bilandic about it and caused him to lost an election. Now every mayor worries about snow. Now, aren&rsquo;t little children more important than snow?  <br>

			<p>The religion of Poltical Correctness is the denial and evasion of physical reality.  It is a giant backward step from the Enlightenment, and that explains how the cretins of the media handle this situation, deny and evade.  The only thing that they have really done is tear down the high rise ghettoes and pack the residents off to the suburbs where you can see them sauntering about looking alien and as stupid as any stereotype could be imagined.  In our suburban school these section 8ers basically low IQ thugs are barely contained by the mommy social worker types that run the system.</p>

 What our MSM self-righteous leftists refuse to state is what Jack Cashill calls the ABETTO factor- a blind eye to the obvious.<br>
This racial conflict is clear evidence of the fallacy of &#8220;Diversity&#8221; as a force for good in communities.<br>
 It&rsquo;s also a sad reality of what author Pascal Bruckner meant by the title his book of several decades ago- &#8220;Tears of the White Man: Compassion as Contempt&#8221;</p>

			<p>We have exactly the same problem here in London with one teenager being murdered once every two weeks. We also have gangs of black youths mugging white women and children on a regular basis. I can never understand why these crimes are&rsquo;nt labelled as hate crimes because they cause much more damage than someone being called a bad name. </p>
<p>These hate crimes are blamed on poverty but poverty was much more severe in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s but people never resorted to this kind of hate. Neighbours would pull together as a community then and help each other out. I wonder what has changed?  </p>

<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I have also argued that our western-created criminal justice system does the same thing.</p>
<p>Blacks complain that our justice system is racist and the point to the fact that blacks never created such systems in Africa.</p>
<p>Whites have long known that there are bad white people. To keep white communities safe, whites devised jails and prisons to keep bad white people away from good white people. Since most crime is committed by young, breeding-age males, the time that bad whites are in jail is the period when they are less likely to breed and pass on their violent genes. Over time, whites have weeded out the  worst of the worst.</p>
<p>Blacks have never done this. They have never had this weeding out process of their gene pool. Hence, violent black males with high sex drives were free to reproduce at exponential levels.</p>
<p>While blacks say too many young black men are in jail, I say just the opposite. Not enough young black men are in jail. Blacks insist they go free. They breed violent offspring and the problem gets worse every generation.</p>

			<p>watfordman  &mdash;  &#8220;These hate crimes are blamed on poverty &hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Take a good look at the US state of West Virginia.  It&rsquo;s among the poorest states if not *the* poorest, yet its crime rate is among the lowest. (So much for gun-toting rednecks shooting up everything in sight.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also mostly white&hellip;blacks make up about 3% of the population.  Compare this to our capital, which is 60% black and whose crime rate is among the highest.  </p>

			<p>Whoever thinks the gang problem is overstated needs to wake up. Short, pot bellied little brown gang bangers might seem comical walking down the street in broad daylight, but they know how to band together. That alone gives them a complete advantage over your bought off complacent head in the clouds white idiot in a street fight. </p>
<p>Any problem that escalates to a brown-white fight, and the brown little Mexican is calling his &#8220;homies&#8221; while the white boy sticks it out alone. They are getting bolder and bolder every day. </p>
<p>If this were a sane country, law enforcement would ramp up harassment of gang bangers, bring them in for questioning and making them distrust one another. Any one goes into jail, put them in jail with blacks or whites instead of their brown homies. </p>

<p>It has gained litlle attention because of the color of the murderers not because of the victims color. The media would love to be able to pin just one of these murders on a white youth.Then it would get more press than the superbowl. </p>

<p>NO Chicago &#8220;children or teens&#8221; have been killed this year.</p>
<p>Those people are young thugs who elected to gleefully turn to violence and have opted to join criminal gangs and live a life of crime because it inflates their sick egos and dimwitted minds.</p>
<p>Case closed.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s turn to matters regarding the future of white children in this nation who all should be home-schooled to prevent their being brainwashed by instructors who are mentally ill.</p>

			<p>&#8220;There are simply too many gangs, too many guns, and too many drugs on the streets&#8221;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Note how no mention is made of the people who have caused this situation to come into being. I guess those guns and drugs just magically appeared out of the blue one day. Here again we see the black mentality - no ability to establish cause and effect and no deductive reasoning.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s also mostly white&hellip;blacks make up about 3% of the population. Compare this to our capital, which is 60% black and whose crime rate is among the highest. </p>
<p>Sooooo&hellip;what are you suggesting here:)</p>

			<p>&#8220;This is one way blacks try to place the blame on whites. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not our fault blacks are killing blacks. It&rsquo;s the white mans&rsquo; fault because he LETS it happen in black communities&rsquo;.</p>
<p>For the record, I AM NOT responsible for black behavior. I never have been and I never will be.</p>
<p>Blacks expect white people to solve the problems blacks create. THEY create they hell they inhabit.</p>

<p>Yes, thier attitude can be summed up as: &#8220;I&rsquo;VE got a problem.  What are YOU going to do about it.&#8221;</p>

			<p>First, there was Congo in 1960. Then came Nigeria&rsquo;s civil war against the breakaway &#8220;republic&#8221; of Biafra. Then came Burundi, Rwanda, Sudan, Uganda, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. In the New World, there is Jamaica, the Crips and Bloods of Los Angeles, then those gangs spread nationwide. Now, there&rsquo;s a big hue and cry in Chicago because Bantus are killing Bantus.</p>
<p>How exactly, is this newsworthy? Only the faces and places change.</p>
<p>The races never do.</p>

			<p>But some claim the deaths have garnered little attention because the vast majority of the young people have been black and Hispanic.</p>
<p>Really? I live in Australia and I heard an article on the radio about it on the BBC World news. The article was about how blacks (in Chicago) expect Obama to personally intervene and solve the problem. Much to the suprise of his supporters, he hasn&rsquo;t started waving that magic wand yet!<br>
The journalist mentioned that Chicago has &#8216;always had a history on violence&rsquo; and even mentioned Al Capone! So I suppose the Italians started it eh?</p>

			<p>&#8220;But, because violence is snuffing out the young lives, Pfleger [the Rev. Michael Pfleger] said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hiding it. We&rsquo;re ignoring it. We&rsquo;re denying the problems.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is these kids have sperm donors for fathers and dimwitted druggie mothers  too busy with their latest sperm donor man to care about anything else. The kids end up feral and wild with no morals, values or disipline.</p>

<p>Good post. And very true. Blacks seem to think their self-inflicted problems can be &#8220;solved&#8221; as if by some magical wave of the wand.</p>

The irony is that gangsters of Al Capone&rsquo;s variety never engaged in, and often prevented, petty crime. The police were spread to think in that era so &#8220;the family&#8221; would provide, literally, protection from lawlessness (usually coming from the nearest black neighborhood). Of course this evolved into the racket that we base our great movies off of, but the point is that even white gangsters are more civilized than the average black.</p>

<p>Actually Capone, like most gangsters of that era, started his career in a street gang doing petty crime.</p>
