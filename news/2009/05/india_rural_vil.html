<h1>India: Rural Villagers Say, &#8220;No Toilet, No Bride.&#8221;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Arnoldy, Christian Science Monitor, May 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In rural India, having a toilet has become an issue of a woman&rsquo;s right. Many homes don&rsquo;t feature plumbing because men, in particular, question the expense  &mdash;  even the desirability  &mdash;  of indoor facilities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s changing rapidly in the state of Haryana, where the government is putting up funds and village women are leaning on their men to get with the program. Their slogan: &#8220;No toilet, no bride.&#8221;</p>
<p>The combined effort has helped boost the number of rural homes with toilets to 60 percent, up from less than 5 percent four years ago, says Kashi Nath Jha, the Haryana local chairman of the sanitation organization Sulabh International.</p>
<p>{snip} [One] bride has already divorced her groom when she learned that his family lied about having a toilet, says Anil Kumar Chhikara, one of the village leaders. Another young woman, Monica, says of any potential suitor, &#8220;I&rsquo;ll be asking him to build a toilet.&#8221; And if he doesn&rsquo;t? &#8220;Then I won&rsquo;t marry him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Women have more clout these days in the village, says Mr. Chhikara, because years of selective-sex abortions have left more bachelors than potential brides.</p>

			<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just me but, if I were an Indian guy looking for an Indian bride, I would be disgusted with the name &#8220;Monica&#8221;.  Indians have many beautiful names of their own.  They should use them.  I think any Indian (or Arab or Chinese&hellip;) who chooses a &#8220;Western&#8221; name for their child is denigrating their own culture.  Cheapening it and treating it like the toilet water being discussed in this article. I don&rsquo;t like hearing of Germans named &#8220;Mohammed&#8221; nor do I like hearing of Turks named Mark.  Those are among the horrors of multiculturalism.  If you have a culture, cherish it, improve upon it and pass it on.  Don&rsquo;t cheapen it by taking a foreign name and pretending you&rsquo;re something you&rsquo;re not.</p>

<p>Ah, yes.  Then it must be true love.  Only a toilet can ever come between them.</p>

			<p>Once again nonwhites are uplifted through white technology.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a story I read a while back about the effects fast food chains like McDonald, KFC and Burger King have had in the far East. </p>
<p>After eating at these places Asians noticed the clean bathrooms and demanded their local restaurants begin cleaning up their &#8220;pig sty&#8221; restrooms.</p>

			<p>A Kuwaiti girl whos parents went to the U.S. for some or other reason, upon returning to Kuwait, they installed western style toilets in their home. She thought it was the best thing since sliced bread!! For those who may not know, most of the world just crouches over a concrete hole in the floor with foot pads on both sides of it with a kitchen style water squirter beside it for cleaning up after (no paperwork)</p>

			<p>I suppose we need some comic relief once in a awhile. This would make a decent Monty Python Comedy sketch. Although, if Monty Python did a sketch about this they would be presecuted for hate crimes in England.</p>
<p>You can get away with insulting Appalachian Whites-Appalachian emergency room skit- on Saturday Night Live. Try doing a comedy sketch about this on  American  TV and the wealthy hindus would scream bloody murder.</p>
<p>India is an overpopulated septic tank. A combination of the passage of the 1965 immigration reform act and amnesty will turn OUR America into a septic tank. Secession won&rsquo;t prevent this from happening. Septic tanks do overflow you know. Atlanta,which has been massively &#8220;blessed&#8221;-many times over- by post-1965 immigrants has turned the Chattahouchie -is this the correct spelling?-sixty miles down, into a septic tank&hellip;tampons,diapers..you name it&hellip; can be seen floating down this great river of the American South. In the future, it will look and smell more like the Ganges river in India.</p>

			<p>I ate once at a place in mainland China in 1987 that I have since called &#8220;The Hepatitis Cafe&#8221; for the deplorable state of its restroom.  The term &#8220;truly hideous&#8221; only begins to fit, and I will not attempt to describe it here except with three words: &#8220;garden hose&#8221; and &#8220;trough&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just me but, if I were an Indian guy looking for an Indian bride, I would be disgusted with the name &ldquo;Monica&rdquo;. Indians have many beautiful names of their own. jewamongyou</p>
<p>FYI names like Monica, Tina, Rita, Sheila and Maya are common Indian names which happen to overlap with Western names (much like Dina is in the Arab world).  They are pronounced a little differently though, the &#8220;O&#8221; in Monica is pronounced like an &#8220;O&#8221; so its more like Mo-Nika which in Bengali for example(a North Indian language), means sensitive. Maya in turn, means compassionate. Note that sensitive and compassionate are qualities universally associated more with the feminine form.   Furthermore, the Hindi word for mother and father are &#8220;Ma&#8221; and &#8220;Papa&#8221; which is strikingly similar to the same in many European and Near Eastern languages.   </p>

			<p>Has anyone on here ever used the public toilet of the FAHAHEEL BAZAAR in the town of Fahaheel in Kuwait City, Kuwait?? There&rsquo;s an experience not to be missed.</p>
