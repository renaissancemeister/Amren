<h1>Some Muslims Rethink Close Ties to Law Enforcement</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Samantha Henry, AP, May 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Across the nation, such grass-roots relationships between Muslims and the federal government are in jeopardy. A coalition of Muslim groups is calling for Muslims to stop cooperating with the FBI  &mdash;  not on national security or safety issues but on community outreach.</p>
<p>The coalition is upset over what it says is increasing government surveillance in mosques, new Justice Department guidelines that the groups say encourage profiling, and the FBI&rsquo;s recent suspension of ties with the nation&rsquo;s largest Muslim civil rights group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations.</p>
<p>A petition that opposes FBI tactics is circulating in Muslim communities and has been gaining support, said coalition chairman Agha Saeed. The coalition, represented by the American Muslim Taskforce on Civil Rights and Elections, has requested a meeting with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to discuss what it sees as the deteriorating relationship between the FBI and Muslim communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to decide what we&rsquo;re doing as a country. If it&rsquo;s not a war on Islam, then these practices must be stopped,&#8221; Saeed said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not asking for special treatment, just equal treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>A number of Muslim groups  &mdash;  including some of the nation&rsquo;s most prominent  &mdash;  have declined to sign the petition. Other organizations say they agree with parts of the petition but also support ongoing dialogue with law enforcement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Supporters of the petition cite recent cases in California and Michigan where the FBI has been accused of using informants and coercive tactics to spy on mosques.</p>
<p>A federal judge in California ordered a review last week of FBI inquiries into several Muslim groups and activists who claim they have been unfairly spied on and questioned. A Muslim organization in Detroit asked Holder in mid-April to investigate complaints that the FBI asked mosque attendees to spy on Islamic leaders and worshippers.</p>
<p>Miller said there is no factual basis for claims the FBI infiltrates mosques or conducts blanket surveillance of Muslim leaders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Muslim leaders say the FBI distinguished itself by reaching out to Muslims, Arab Americans and groups like Sikhs in the wake of 9/11. Relationships forged between the FBI and Muslim leaders in New Jersey have endured since.</p>

			<p>If the FBI isn&rsquo;t going to keep tabs on unwelcome foreigners, what do we need it for?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Muslim coalition says FBI is spying on them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I guess they have one, half-opened sleepy eye on them, but their full attention is on the tea party protestors, the third party candidates, the second amendment advocates, the illegal immigrant protestors, et al, who are the real dangers to this country. </p>
<p>Just ask the SPLC, er, I mean the DHS, and they&rsquo;ll tell you straight out.<br>

			<p>Has it occurred to these Muslims who accuse the FBI of &#8220;spying&#8221; on them that there are good reasons they are being watched?  After all, it isn&rsquo;t Poles or Scots who have been committing terrorist attacks on US soil or providing money and support to violent groups overseas.</p>
<p>One wonders who they think the FBI should be watching instead, if not Muslims.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t, and considering the policies and conduct of Nepolitano in HS, we no longer need that office either!! Like many others, I expect a serious attack on CONUS anytime now, muslims are WAITING and PLANNING.</p>

<p>I read that as &#8216;forged&rsquo; as in forgery or fraud. Fraudulant relations between Muslim leaders and the FBI.</p>
<p>This is just more of everone reaching to grab the lowest rung of the ladder. In America, to lose is to win. The last shall be first. When will it ever change?</p>

			<p> Fraudulant relations between Muslim leaders and the FBI.</p>
<p>Muslim &#8220;leaders&#8221; in the U.S. is just another description for black race panderers.  If Jesse and Al convert, they can hit us all with the double whammy (race AND religious prejudice) In Iraq, within any military AO, we get shot at or rocketed from almost all of the mosques, and weapons have been found in all of them, coming soon to a community near&hellip;.EVERYONE!</p>

			<p>By complaining that the FBI is unfairly picking on Muslims when it looks for terrorists, these nut-jobs are in effect saying that it is unfair to go to a river or lake to look for fish, rather than - for instance - underneath the parked cars at Wal Mart (Are there fish there?  I&rsquo;ve never checked.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said this before on another thread, but this complaint on their part also falls into the &#8220;We are idiots and we think you are idiots as well&#8221; category.</p>
