How Many More Pro Athletes Are Involved in Dog Fighting?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Gibson, Norfolk (Virginia) Examiner, May 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While most of us are sickened by the details of NFL star Michael Vick&rsquo;s brutal and cowardly treatment of his dogs, apparently, dog fighting is an acceptable activity for many other thuggish professional athletes.</p>
<p>Shortly after Vick&rsquo;s 2007 arrest, the New York Knicks&rsquo; Stephon Marbury, defended Vick by saying: &#8220;They don&rsquo;t say anything about people shooting deer.&#8221; He went on to declare: &#8220;Dog fighting is a sport!&#8221;</p>
<p>Former NFL player Deion Sanders even wrote an article for NewsPress.com defending Vick&rsquo;s criminal behavior.</p>
<p>Sanders justified the brutality by saying: &#8220;What a dog means to Vick might be a lot different than what he means to you.&#8221; He went on to offer the following insights: &#8220;I believe Vick had a passion for dog fighting. I know many athletes who share his passion. The allure is the intensity and the challenge of a dog fighting to the death. It&rsquo;s like ultimate fighting, but the dog doesn&rsquo;t tap out when he knows he can&rsquo;t win.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet another of Vick&rsquo;s colleagues, Washington Redskin&rsquo;s Clinton Portis told a reporter with WAVY-TV: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know if he was fighting dogs or not, but it&rsquo;s his property, it&rsquo;s his dog. If that&rsquo;s what he wants to do, do it. I think people should mind their business.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to hunt down Mike Vick over fighting some dogs?,&#8221; Portis said. &#8220;I think people should mind their own business. I know a lot of back roads that have the dog fighting if you want to go see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>While we will hear the usual excuses as to why many poor blacks engage in dog fighting, those excuses do not hold water for Vick. Nor do they explain the callous attitude towards dog fighting shared by many of his fellow millionaires. However, the NAACP still defended the owner of Bad Newz kennels.</p>
<p>In 2007, President of the Atlanta Chapter of the NAACP, R.L. told CNN: &#8220;The way he [Vick] is being persecuted, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been persecuted that much had he killed somebody.&#8221; White went on to condemn the NFL for suspending him and demanded that Vick eventually be reinstated and allowed to play.</p>
<p>It now looks as if the NAACP&rsquo;s demand will be met. Though Vick is still officially suspended from the NFL, commissioner Roger Goodell&rsquo;s recent comments show that the door is now open for Vick to return in the near future.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While professional athletes such as Michael Vick are idolized by millions of poor black teenage boys, many of whom unfortunately also see a prison sentence as badge of honor, Vick&rsquo;s actions have only been further encouragement to torture man&rsquo;s best friend. A story printed in the Chattanooga, Tennessee newspaper (article can be found at Chattanoogan.com) speaks to the savage attitudes of many black teenage boys in regards to both dog and man.</p>
<p>The story reads: &#8220;Last week, a Chattanooga man was attacked by three black teens as he tried to protect his dog from their pit bull. Humberto Sales heard a commotion and ran out into his front yard. There he saw the three black males attempting to incite a fight between their dog and his. Mr. Sales&rsquo; dog would not fight, so they began stomping and kicking his dog. As Mr. Sales ran to protect his dog, the blacks hurled rocks at him, until he lay bleeding in his own yard. The black assailants ran away and Sales was taken to Erlanger Medical Center.&#8221;</p>
<p>What was traditionally an activity participated in by poor whites in the rural South, dog fighting has now become as popular as football or basketball in the poor inner city. To this element, the cruel act of pitting dogs against one another which often ends with one or both dogs being maimed or killed, is seen no differently than a boxing match.</p>

I was watching the CNN debate on whether or not Vic should be allowed to resume his career.</p>
<p>The blacks said he paid his dues and he should not be continued to be punished.</p>
<p>The whites were vehement in their condemnation of hanging and slaughtering dogs that didn&rsquo;t perform. They said Vic was a role model and shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to play.</p>
<p>I have to wonder how Vic and his friends reacted (perhaps with laughter and delight?) as they &#8216;lynched&rsquo; these dogs and watched them writhe in pain and terror. I&rsquo;ll bet there was a great deal of excitement and high-fives. I&rsquo;ll bet there&rsquo;s video too but it will never be made public. </p>
<p>We just had two cases here in Buffalo involving blacks and dogs. A black veterinarian left an emaciated dog to suffer outside his clinic without providing any aid. The ASPCA is livid and he&rsquo;s under investigation. The second involved a women who left her done in a cage to die.</p>

		<p>I have my doubts.  I think these are Vick allies implying that they do it too (when they really don&rsquo;t), so Michael Vick can portray himself as less evil than he actually was.  It&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re pulled over going 10 over the speed limit, and you ask the cop why he didn&rsquo;t go after the person going faster than you were.  Why would Stephon Marbury and the others implicate themselves and those they know, when they can see that it leads to Federal prison and no sports career after prison?  That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t think they actually do it.</p>
<p>Animal husbandry seems to be a concept ill understood among blacks.  Many black neighborhoods are notorious for having packs of dogs that were jettisoned pets, the dogs do what free dogs do and organize as packs.  Several years ago, a black boy was mauled to death by such a packs of dogs in north St. Louis City.  In response, the St. Louis media went into a lot of neighborhoods to show packs of dogs, but of course they failed to make the link to race.</p>
<p>Pit bulls, though, seem to be the breed that they keep and hold on to vigorously.  Why?  Property protection, drug dealing.  </p>

		<p>As a former dog breeder I had to be very careful about who I sold my puppies to. They were a toy breed and it had been very popular for people who fought dogs to give them small puppies to kill starting when they were hardly more than puppies themselves. I tried to never sell to Hispanics that did not have a good grasp of English, Blacks or very low class looking people of any race. I also kept my prices high enough that anyone that was looking for dog fighting bait would look elsewhere. </p>

		<p>Urban blacks males choose to own Pitbulls &amp; Rottweilers by large margin for the power and status they represent and don&rsquo;t really consider dogs in general &#8220;pets&#8221; as whites do. Drive through any black neighborhood and you&rsquo;d swear there are only two breeds in existence!</p>
<p>People usually choose breeds which coorespond to their own personalities and physical characteristics. So it should come as no surprise that aggressive thug-types would choose muscle dogs that will likely be abused, neglected and eventually abandoned. </p>

		<p>As there are varieties of religious experience, perhaps torture dons disguise.  The Geneva Convention prohibits the estrangement of children under the age of fifteen.  So, would you rather squat with a bug in a box or sit forlorn on the stoop and watch your child bused by force to a violent, urban school?  Does the blood sacrifice Herself become holy?  When will our sanctimonious southpaws find their day of tribunal reckoning?</p>

    Personally, I tend to take their statements at face value. A number of years ago, a black teacher revealed to a class that he had wantonly killed someone decades before. This moron didn&rsquo;t realize that the statute of limitations did not apply to murder.<br>
More than once, news media relates a police report of some ghetto-dweller calling 911 over the theft of their stash.<br>
The desire for attention, good or bad, overrides common sense, charitably assuming there was any to begin with.</p>

		<p>It has been said for ages that you can often tell a lot about people by their attitudes and behaviors toward animals. If you can&rsquo;t see the difference between hunting and fighting dogs to the death for kicks and sport, you pretty much expose yourself for all to see&hellip; </p>

<p>As usual, it&rsquo;s all evil Whitey&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>I can see where dog fighting is more exciting than deer hunting.  You don&rsquo;t get close to the deer until it is either dead or down.  The hunter doesn&rsquo;t have to actually bite the deer as dogs bite each other.  Most of the time you are just walking through the woods.  Then if you get your buck, you have to gut it and hump it out.</p>
<p>Dog fighting is less strenous.  You&rsquo;re not out there in the November cold.  On the other hand, the deer take care of themselves.  You don&rsquo;t have to have a kennel and training.  Nor do you have to buy or breed deer.</p>
<p>I can see the attraction of dog fighting.  But it is against the law and deer hunting is not.</p>

<p>My neighbors have some sort of fluffy white terrier. It&rsquo;s from an animal shelter.  It was a bait fighting dog used to train pit bulls.  The thing looks like something in a toy store, but I looked up the breed and they are rat hunting fighters although they are small.</p>

		<p>I abhor animal abusers and they need to be punished longer than that Vick was! Most animals are helpless at the hands of those that torture and kill them. If he gets to play again for the NFL, and be rewarded for his barbaric behavior and attitude, then all is lost for any civil society. Any team that signs him needs to be boycotted and verbal outrage against these team owners and managers. In fact, I cannot see why any White even supports these sports teams anylonger. Why are they spending their money to make people like Vick and all the other thug criminals who play, rich? WHY?</p>

It should be noted that no dog breeds originated in Africa, not Northern Africa, nor Sub-saharan Africa. Dog breeds developed from wolves in Europe bred among the White Euroid peoples and the breeds of dogs evolved with Cro-Magnon humans through the various stone ages and copper, iron ages as companions.</p>
<p>The only dog breed in Africa is a hairless, barkless terrier type dog that wandered back to Africa from the peripheries of White settlements in Europe.</p>
<p>Africans have no affinity for affectionate relations with animals, nothing like the European caucasian bonding with dog breeds. American blacks keep dogs, but not care for dogs. </p>
<p>Dogs are just property, the same attitude that led to the African tribal chiefs to sell other black Africans to Europeans or Arabs or use as offerings to their animistic polytheism beliefs.</p>
<p>It is no surprise that Vick and other American africans brutalize dogs, but it is surprising that some White Amricans would have the blood lust for their canine companions, must be domestic abuse pathological transference.</p>

		<p>Blacks in Africa never domesticated any species till the Europeans came, even after that they are indifferent herders. After Zimbabwe and South Africa fall for good to the Blacks, I doubt that there will be any goats or other domestics animals left due to them being eaten. Africa will return to the feast or famine cycle of the paleolithic era. </p>
<p>Book tip for all. &#8220;African Rifle Cartridges&#8221; by Taylor. Really astonishing reading for those who would be interested in a hunters view of Africa and Africans circa 1920&rsquo; through 1950&rsquo;s. Taylor estimated that 10,000 to 20,000 Blacks were taken every year by Crocs alone.</p>

		<p>This one was fun to watch from the start. It is always great fun to watch competing PC forces going at it. In this case it was the animal rights crowd and the race hustler crowd. Most of the animal rights crowd would not get that worked up if the victim&rsquo;s of Vick were people, especially White People. But they seemed to back off some when the race hustler crowd came out for Vick. This is not to condone what Vick did, but as always white liberal&rsquo;s will always fold like a cheap camera when confronted by race hustler&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I used to breed German Shepherds. With my last litter, I had a string of weirdos whose first names were always &#8220;Uhh.&#8221; As in:</p>
<p> &#8220;My name&rsquo;s Charlie. And yours?&#8221; <br>
(half second pause) &#8220;Uhh, Donald.&#8221; (Do you spell that with one &#8216;H&rsquo; or two?) Strike one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uhh Donald&#8221; claimed to have trained police dogs for 10 years, then in the next breath asked where he could get a &#8216;bite suit&rsquo; (protective padded suit worn by decoys in protection training). If he&rsquo;s trained police dogs, he should know where to get all the needed equipment. Unless this idiot lets full grown German Shepherds bite his bare arms and legs. Strike two. </p>
<p>I later found out that &#8220;Uhh Donald&#8221; was calling from a cell phone on a month-to-month contract (with only a first name on the contract, that was NOT Donald) that had four Oakland, CA addresses associated with it.  </p>
<p>Swing and a miss! STRIKE THREE! You&rsquo;re OUTTA THERE!</p>

		<p>One should not expect much more from something like Vick.  His appearance defines his anthropology and explains his behavior.  As for the comments by his equally dim &#8220;brothers&#8221; regarding his right to kill his dog because he owns it: what more would you expect from a group of primates that spend most of their time raping, infecting, beating, or killing other living things  &mdash;  including family members.<br>
However, the primary reason I felt the need to comment is to ask, &#8220;Where in the hell is PETA in all of this!!?&#8221;  You remember PETA?  They&rsquo;re the courageous organization that runs through the woods scaring deer away from the ugly (white) hunters.  They&rsquo;re the brave souls that tear around on jet skis between (white peoples&rsquo;) boats to disrupt the fishing.<br>
But..I haven&rsquo;t seen any reference to a position PETA has taken on the &#8220;rich cultural activity&#8221; of dog fighting&hellip;.      </p>

		<p>If Michael Vick wants to prove how much of a &#8216;man&rsquo; he is - have him go through the same pain and suffering that just one of his victims did.</p>
<p>I wonder if the offer of that will introduce the concept of &#8216;empathy&rsquo; to him?</p>

		<p>I personally do not care if people engage in dog fighting.  It is not an important issue.  There are too many serious problems in America for us to be worried about dogs.</p>
<p>Our nation has been overrun by 20 million&hellip;30 million&hellip;40 million invaders who treat us worse than M. Vick treats dogs and we allow this non-issue to take up news time?  Come on!  I especially do not want to pay taxes to incarcerate people who abuse animals.  It&rsquo;s a waste of money.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s true that whites have a special relationship to animals and nature that makes us different from all other races. Chinese and Koreans think nothing of eating magnificent, loving dogs who have been bred as companions for humans (by whites first and foremost), which is great cruelty. Blacks and even Spanish don&rsquo;t have the same affectionate bond with dogs that Anglo Saxons do. </p>
<p>At the same time, I refuse to get excited about Michael Vick dog fighting. Pitt bulls first of all are bred as fighting animals. Rottweilers were military dogs bred to attack and kill humans. These are &#8220;bad breeds&#8221; or &#8220;poverty dogs&#8221; by any other name, no matter how beautiful they are as animals. If the worst race problem in our country was dog fighting, we would be in better shape and there would be no need for this website. </p>
<p>What is good to understand is that blacks have a natural fear reaction to dogs and most other animals. Blacks have never domesticated any animal and are scared even of woods (which to whites is an inviting, natural habitat). Blacks prefer the violent, vicious dog breeds because to blacks, all animals are menacing anyway. Hounds were once trained to hunt down slaves in the swamps of the old south by their black body smell, and maybe blacks remember that somehow. </p>

		<p>a humanistic and affectionate attitude towards dogs and other animal is a hallmark of EUROPEAN civilization, and is absent from mosat (all???) other cultures. </p>
<p>We are NOT all &#8220;the same unde the skin,&#8221; and the more I know about African culture worldwide, the more profoundly alien it seems (but the it also seems that way to many blacks who have opted for European values).<br>

<p>Book tip for all. &ldquo;African Rifle Cartridges&rdquo; by Taylor. Really astonishing reading for those who would be interested in a hunters view of Africa and Africans circa 1920&rsquo; through 1950&rsquo;s. Taylor estimated that 10,000 to 20,000 Blacks were taken every year by Crocs alone.<br>

<p>I suppose the answer lies with the insights some of you have posted; these africans were never a part of breeding dogs to become our companions, they do not think like us and their ability to think abstractly is woefully inadequate or totally nonexistent.  </p>

		<p>We have a big problem in London with dogs being used as weapons by black teenagers since the police had a crackdown on teenagers carrying knives. It seems that whatever you do to civilize some people they will always find an ingenious way to get around attempts to tame their instincts and revert to normal behaviour. </p>
<p>First it was the fault of guns so we controlled guns, then it was the fault of knives so we had a crackdown on knives, now its the fault of dangerous dogs so we have to control dangerous dogs. I think we&rsquo;re missing something here that&rsquo;s staring us in the face.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;I think it would be more interesting to know how many of the millionaire sports figures (also black rappers) are involved in the drug trade, murders, illegitimate children and weapons violations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those in hip hop will be the first to assert that it is a &#8220;culture&#8221; and not just a musical style, and indeed this is so: it is a culture which holds dear being &#8220;hard&#8221; and &#8220;street&#8221; and being feared.  As such, it is very difficult to start a successful rap career without having verifiable associations with crime, though there are a few exceptions. Some rappers, not having a marketable criminal lifestyle, commit crimes seemingly for the express purpose of advancing their careers.  Others lie about their criminal past, but risk being outed and disowned by the &#8220;hip hop community&#8221; for not being &#8220;real&#8221;.  So I think the majority of professional rappers or their close associates are or have been to some degree involved in the activities you mentioned.</p>

		<p>First off, Pit Bulls are not vicious. Like all terriers they have dog aggression, but this can be socialized out of them i.e. training. Secondly, they are typically human friendly unless trained to be otherwise through neglect or abuse. That is why they can be handled by dog fighters. They fight out of loyalty and to make them fight unnecessarily is an injustice to the breed. Who is vicious and cruel? The dog or the dog fighter? My pitbull has been socialized. He is a 65 lb lap dog. He sleeps next to my cat. Every day I look at him and think how a Micheal Vick would treat him and I get angry, as well as deal with a rush of other emotions, like sadness, empathy inspired remorse for being a part of a society that lets people off this easily, etc.</p>
<p>Pit bulls are noble, maligned and endangered, just like us. They were Americas breed. On my block alone 4 people own pits, including a family with small children. It used to be 5. None of them are thugs and &#8220;gangstas&#8221;. None of the dogs are aggressive and I do not fear any of them. Now if there were 5 Micheal Vicks on my block&hellip;</p>

		<p>As a dog lover of many years, I can&rsquo;t believe the cruelty. However, I have always suspected that people who could do this to dogs or other animals, aren&rsquo;t far from being able to do something similar to a fellow human. Most dogs are not inherently mean. I have owned five German Shepherds, during various times of my life. Not one has ever attached me unprovoked. Yet, German Shepherds used to be on a so-called top 10 mean dogs list. I have seldom heard of one attacking someone, without being seriously provoked. </p>
<p>The same thing goes for pitbulls. It is simply not true that these dogs are inherently mean. Here in Southern California, gangbangers, trailer trash, and others have more or less adopted them as their special dog. I&rsquo;ve seen them locked up in pens on residences, and small businesses, during one-hundred degree plus heat, with no shelter. They get mistreated by most of the idiots who own them. My college chemistry professor and his wife owned two pit bulls, and despite his having inumerable get togethers with his students, the dogs never bothered anyone and loved being petted. Vic deserves what he got, he is lucky to not be punished more for his cruelty.</p>

<p>He barked a lot, but he was pure poison on woodchucks.  25 years later, I still miss Gregor.</p>

		<p>The Dog Whisperer&rsquo;s advice for owners of pitt bull and other <br>
&#8220;champion&#8221; breeds is to exercise them enough every day so they don&rsquo;t have the excess energy that otherwise translates into violence. Wear them out and they will be calm and happy.  </p>
<p>He has good advice that could be applied well in human society. Too many of our problems are caused by forcing people built by nature for outdoor labor, hunting, fishing, and physical work and exposure to the elements in general into sedentary work. I think this is partly to blame for obesity in Americans. </p>
<p>Sedentary lifestyle also ties into our multicult America where most cities are abandoned and avoided out of fear of blacks and browns, people drive everywhere and seldom walk, illegal labor depresses wages for blue collar jobs, etc. We are becoming more and more a bunker society, especially the digitized younger generation. </p>

		<p>Reading this article strikes a nerve within me. Two weeks ago, to the day, my pet stray cat became sick and died last Thursday. I suspect poisoning. A day or two before he became ill, i noticed that he had been vomiting across the street from my moms house in a wooded area where he would sometimes go. At that time, i dismissed that anything was seriously wrong with him. I have raised that beautiful cat (along with his brother,) since he was a kitten, about eight months. I will miss him. Next store to my parents home, there is a house which is occupied by a really bad and arrogant black bunch, that we don&rsquo;t like and get along with. (Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, there are other blacks who live in that same neighborhood, who for the most part are decent people.) Like a Micheal Vick type. Again, i can only supect foul play. But i would not put it past them. The horrible part is knowing that if they could mistreat or destroy that animal&hellip;.they are a danger to me, my family, and to society.  </p>

		<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t own dogs for pets. They &#8216;own&rsquo; them for protection or as a weapon. See your average black guy with his dog. Is it a Pomeranian or Cocker Spaniel? Or a pit bull or Rottweiler? Usually the latter.</p>

<p>Yeah, I see the difference:  A pit bull matched against another pit bull of roughly the same size has a 50/50 chance of survival; can one say the same about a deer matched with a high powered rifle bullet, delivered by a concealed hunter a quarter of a mile away?  also, left to their own devices, dogs choose to fight over pack supremacy,  I don&rsquo;t think many deer choose to get their heads splattered open.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What was traditionally an activity participated in by poor whites in the rural South,&#8221;</p>
<p>And where do you get that info, pal? The South has developed numerous breeds mainly for tracking/hunting: mostly hounds, but others. If we were so keen on fighting dogs we would have come up with new breeds for that too. And the North? The Boston terrier and that&rsquo;s about it (which by the way were periodically fought according to wik). The development of breeds of animals is the mark of culture. I have heard about cock fighing  &mdash;  which doesn&rsquo;t bother me though it is illegal now  &mdash;  but little of dog fighting growing up from the old people. It is done here now, but mainly by blacks I believe  &mdash;  AS IN THE NORTH. Further, I always see in pictures the ol&rsquo;timey dog fights in cities, and we all know where most of those where. Your trying to saddle us yet again.</p>

		<p>Rudy, I&rsquo;m very sorry to hear about your cat.  I was feeding a cat here in my neighborhood that suddenly disappeared.  My landlady, who caters to blacks to prove she isn&rsquo;t prejudiced (and yet continually talks out of the other side of her mouth against them) hates cats.  I have also seen this hatred of cats amongst blacks.  It&rsquo;s like they are afraid of them.  My landlady is white, and yes, she voted for Obama because &#8220;It was time for blacks to have their turn&#8221; (no mention on actually being QUALIFIED for the office of leader of the free world)&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway, a few months ago I encountered a neighbor down the street who feeds strays.  She said that several of them appeared to have been poisoned, that on a vacant lot, someone had poured a substance that attracted them, they licked their paws, and later died.  She was sitting on her porch seeing this, but didn&rsquo;t connect it to the deaths until after several cats died.  I suspect antifreeze mixed with meat, or something similar.  She told me that after she buried the dead cats, that the grave had some kind of change in the earth around it, like it had absorbed something that reacted with water when it rained.  I don&rsquo;t have much chemical training, but I guess that&rsquo;s possible.  Any chemists on the board who can enlighten me? So, Rudy, we may have people in our neighborhoods with similar deadly mindsets.  I am moving and will be out of here next month, which is very stressful, but ultimately in a good way, because I firmly believe what happens to animals can happen to humans next.</p>
<p>I have met many blacks who out and out hate cats.  I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but they refuse to have anything to do with them.  I have even met blacks, whom, thank God, I no longer have to be around, who let their dog kill cats who &#8220;wandered&#8221; on to the property.  I suspect they were using the cats to train the dog to fight, and I reported them to the ASPCA.  </p>
<p>Has anyone reading this had any unusual experiences with blacks and cats?  I&rsquo;d like to know, because it seems to be a real problem.  And I wonder if training dogs for dog fighting starts with cats who supposedly &#8220;wander&#8221; into the yard where vicious dogs are.  In my experience, very few cats would do that.</p>

<p>Well you may not believe it, but perhaps you should do a bit more research. During the Vick debacle several prominant black&rsquo;s openly stated it is part of black culture (Whoopi Goldberg for one).</p>

		<p>As a former hunter, I resent the comparison between deer hunting and dog fighting.  The goal in deer hunting is to produce the quickest, most humane kill possible and acquire meat for the table, and NOT to watch an animal suffer.</p>
<p>How many of the losers of these dog fights are later consumed as meat by the human spectators?  I would bet the answer is &#8220;none&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sadly, given the way blacks treat other people, it should come as no suprise at all that they would be vicious with animals, too.</p>
