<h1>Democrats Seek Financial Rescue of Minority-Owned Broadcasters</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Silla Brush, The Hill, May 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>High-ranking House Democrats are urging the Treasury Department to prop up minority-owned broadcasters suffering from a lack of capital and lost advertising revenue amid the economic slump.</p>
<p>House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) is leading an effort to convince Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to take &#8220;decisive action&#8221; by extending credit to this sector of the broadcasting industry.</p>
<p>Clyburn and other senior members, including House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), argue that minority-owned broadcasters are sound businesses, but that the recession could undermine the government&rsquo;s efforts to diversify the airwaves.</p>
<p>A number of members from the Congressional Black Caucus signed the letter, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;While many jobs are at stake, a more important principle  &mdash;  the government&rsquo;s fundamental interest in promoting a diversity of voices, including service to underserved communities  &mdash;  is severely threatened,&#8221; the members write in a draft of a letter that was scheduled to be sent Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The congressmen suggest the Treasury Department could provide access to capital to minority-owned broadcasters, which they say represent less than 7 percent of full-power radio stations and a &#8220;negligible&#8221; ownership of television stations.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are looking for continued access to capital to continue their otherwise fundamentally sound operations,&#8221; the members write.</p>
<p>The letter suggests Treasury could set up a credit facility specific to the industry, similar to the government&rsquo;s efforts to support auto suppliers, or possibly set up a program for bridge financing and government-backed loans until the economy improves.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other members signing the letter are Democratic Reps. Bobby Rush (Ill.), Edolphus Towns (N.Y.), Maurice Hinchey (N.Y.), Carolyn Maloney (N.Y.), Maxine Waters (Calif.), Gregory Meeks (N.Y.), G.K. Butterfield (N.C.), Barbara Lee (Calif.), Lynn Woolsey (Calif.) and Bennie Thompson (Miss.)<br>

			<p>This might be a blessing disguise for our cause.  For if it gets black radicals like Onion Horton and Lizz Brown (St. Louisans will recognize those names) back on the air, it will only drive whites to our side.  I wish we had a lot of real right-wing racial talk radio, but in the absence of that, I would take every major cities having five black radical stations, spewing all their vitriol towards whites.</p>
<p>The irony of this, as Rush noted today, is that black owned radio is hurting because of the auto companies not buying as much ads as they usually do.</p>

After the &#8216;uprisings&rsquo; of the &#8216;60&rsquo;s, many black communities got black radio stations that were meant to be the voice of the black community.</p>
<p>We have one such station here in Buffalo.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wufoam.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.wufoam.com/</a></p>
<p>Few people listen to it. The talk show call-ins involve the same 5 to (at most) 10 callers many of whom can&rsquo;t keep on topic or have their own rants and agendas.</p>
<p>This stations have been a failure but as useless as they are, there&rsquo;s no chance of getting rid of them. Trying to get rid of them would bring a short burst of concerned listeners but after the crisis ended, nobody would listen or care.</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, they can have these stations. They can rant about racism, injustice, and TRY to organize protests and call-to-actions. It gives them a sense they have something when they have nothing.</p>

			<p>Why not institute a radio and television tax and broadcast multicultural propaganda 24/7 like the BBC?</p>

			<p>Does anyone remember Rev. IKE in Boston? did he have his own radio broadcast station? he could be heard ALL OVER THE COUNTRY begging for money to &#8220;and I&rsquo;m RICH BABY&#8221; he would say out loud on the waves, to which blacks would throw money at him. The government probably did too.</p>

			<p>There needs to be a pro-white televison network the same way there are black and Latino networks.  Amren, VDARE and others could band together and produce some very compelling tv.  </p>

			<p>Local black talk-radio (WDBZ, &#8220;The Buzz&#8221;) was instumental in fomenting Cincinnati&rsquo;s 2001 riots.</p>
<p>The Afro-friendly Democrat city government chose to indulge and placate the riled-up malcontents rather than have a racial profiling case put to trial.</p>
<p>Result: Federal Department of Justice oversight of local law enforcement, and &#8220;Collaborative Agreement&#8221; between city government and black community organizations.  The city was held liable for any breech of contract while the community groups were excused from accountability by the Clinton-appointed federal judge who arbitrated.  &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; were specifically designated as a protected &#8220;class.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Then there was a rush to appoint blacks to every possible open position in govt. and the private sector (from City Manager to head coach of the NFL Bengals), with the local Democratic Party even asking the popular (shoo-in) white Democrat Mayor not to run in the primary in order that a black man could win the seat.</p>
<p>All the while, the local media was bombarding us with racial indoctrination (i.e., white guilt/black pain) aimed at &#8220;healing&#8221; the city while the national MSM portrayed us and our police as intolerant racists.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not nearly the whole story.</p>
<p>So, if any AmRen reader thinks black radio is harmless entertainment, I suggest you tune in more frequently and listen more carefully to what&rsquo;s going on there.  Of particular note might be &#8220;The Bev Smith Show&#8221; on syndicated American Urban Radio Networks.              </p>
<p>And tell your Congressmen you don&rsquo;t want your tax dollars helping to diversify the airwaves by propping up these hostile minority-owned broadcasters.   </p>
