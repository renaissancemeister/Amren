<h1>Survey Delves Into High Birth Rate for Young Latinas</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Moni Basu, CNN, May 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>It&rsquo;s not what she wanted. Nor did her parents, who are the greatest influence on her decisions about sex, according to a wide-ranging survey released Tuesday by experts on the Hispanic community in the United States.</p>
<p>The survey also found that 84 percent of Latino teens and 91 percent of Latino parents believe that graduating from college or university or having a promising career is the most important goal for a teen&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, the aspirations fail to match up to reality. The survey attempts to examine some of the reasons for the disparity and why Latinas now have the highest teen birth rate among all ethnic and racial groups in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a big disconnect between pregnancy rates and what Latina families want and value,&#8221; said Ruthie Flores, senior manager of the National Campaign&rsquo;s Latino Initiative.</p>
<p>According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, 53 percent of Latinas get pregnant in their teens, about twice the national average.</p>
<p>After a period of decline, the birth rate for U.S. teenagers 15 to 19 years rose in 2007 by about 1 percent, to 42.5 births per 1,000, according to preliminary data in a March 2009 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s National Center for Health Statistics.</p>
<p>Of the 759 Latino teens surveyed, 49 percent said their parents most influenced their decisions about sex, compared with 14 percent who cited friends. Three percent cited religious leaders, 2 percent teachers and 2 percent the media. Video Watch more on the survey results Â»</p>
<p>Three-quarters of Latino teens said their parents have talked to them about sex and relationships, but only half said their parents discussed contraception.</p>
<p>The survey also found that:</p>
<p>o 74 percent of Latino teens believe that parents send one message about sex to their sons and a different message altogether to their daughters, possibly related to the Latino value of machismo.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>o 76 percent said it is important to be married before starting a family.</p>
<p>Flores said it is crucial to understand the beliefs and attitudes that influence teen behavior in order to reduce the high rates of Hispanic teen pregnancy. The survey, co-sponsored by the Hispanic advocacy group National Council of La Raza, was an attempt to to do just that.</p>
<p>She said that despite a rich culture and the growing influence of Hispanics in America, the Latino community disproportionately suffers from troubling social indicators.</p>
<p>Consider that fewer than six in 10 Latino adults in the United States have a high school diploma. Latino teens are more likely to drop out than their non-Hispanic counterparts, and of all the children living in poverty, 30 percent are Latino.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Flores said 69 percent of Latino teen moms drop out of high school, and the children of teen mothers are less likely to do well in school themselves and often repeat grades.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an impact that is sure to be noticed. The nation&rsquo;s 45 million Latinos constitute the largest minority group in the United States with a growth rate twice that of the general population.</p>
<p>That means by 2025, one-quarter of all American teens will be Latinos.<br>

			<p>I find it interesting that 15 years old is the minimum age studied here.  There is a Hispanic coming of age tradition for young women that turn 15, I think it&rsquo;s called quinceanos (there should be a curly mark over the &#8220;n&#8221; in quinceanos, otherwise it means something really naughty).  There is a debate on whether quinceanos is merely the Hispanic equivalent for &#8220;sweet sixteen&#8221; or it really means that she is now available in the most obvious way.  This story suggests that it&rsquo;s more the latter.</p>

			<p>Another one of the many &#8220;blessings&#8221; bestowed upon Native Born White America by the 1965 Immigration Reform Act. Hispanics are waging a vicious race war against Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Enormous demographic momentum has now been built into the population structure of the United States. Unless something drastic is done, the US population will reach billion. Everyone here neeeds to understand that you just don&rsquo;t wake up one day and deceide..&#8221;500 million ..a billion ..Ok we will stop growing at this number&#8221; Once the US population hits a billions it is ineveitable that the US population will hit one billion and half.</p>
<p>Putting aside the racial transformation of Ameria for the moment,hispanic immigration is a very serious threat to the preservation of endangered species,water supplies,farm supplies and the amentities like open space. It is truly an ecological catastrophe in the making.</p>
<p>Now cnsider this, What if Native Born White fertility increases? If it does-and I am all fot it-The billion mark will be hit a lot sooner..possibly in 25 years..and the US population will continue to grow from there.</p>
<p>You think secesson is the answer? Well, if the Native Born White population increases in a smaller amount of territory, it is going to feel very crowded real soon in the White territory&hellip;plus there will be the ecological catastrophe areas adjacent to the White Homelands.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling ya folks,we are moving into very dangerous territory..real sooooon!!!. What a a nightmare in the making..possibly irreversible. Now throw in the high fertility asians,muslims and carribeans,nigerians and ghanians. All the great National and State parks are going to paved over for affordable housing. </p>

			<p>I sincerely doubt the validity of any survey that claims 91% of Latino parents believe that graduating from college or university or having a promising career is the most important goal for a teen&rsquo;s future.  Unless, of course, &#8220;promising career&#8221; includes roofing or hanging drywall.</p>
<p>Hispanic culture is notoriously anti-education.  Latino drop-out rates are worse than Blacks.  Blacks at least pay lip-service to education, largely because slaves were denied educations.</p>
<p>Latinos value work and raising a family over education.  The Black or Jewish mother scrubbing floors so her son can go to college would appall a Latino.  What kind of man would let his mother scrub floors so he didn&rsquo;t have to work?</p>
<p>It can even be seen as a sign of disrespect to want to be better educated than your parents.  </p>

<p>Well, here it is stated in black and white, yet for years people were called racist who made this very point. They were called racist by groups like NATIONAL COUNCIL OF LA RAZA, an organization that co-sponsored this study!! This shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise though, because as one hispanic leader said during an amnesty attempt,(sorry I forgot the name) and I paraphrase him, We don&rsquo;t accuse people who disagree with our goals of being racist because we believe their racist, we accuse them of it because it accomplishes our goals. I believe this was secretly taped by a minutewomen who infiltrated one of their meetings.</p>

			<p>It is very common around here for mestizos to be involved in the rape or sexual assault of young white girls; these attitudes about the legitimacy of underage intercourse seem to be one of those Hispanic Family Values.</p>

			<p>How far afield of biology are whites willing to go? The Hispanics are winning the demographic war partly because they have not turned against nature or tried to transform young women into scholars and executives or delay coming of age to the late twenties. </p>
<p>Moral law that is not rooted in nature is not moral at all. When a girl becomes a young woman able to bear children and thinking of boys all the time, that is nature saying something. If whites keep turning their backs on nature, nature will keep turning her back on whites. Children are a blessing and one of the greatest joys in life. Too many whites view children as an optional &#8220;lifestyle choice&#8221; like having a dog, vacation, or SUV. </p>

			<p>Question Diversity, the Quincenera (?) does mean that she&rsquo;s ready for breeding.  That&rsquo;s why you have these 25 year old Mexican men with their 15 year old bedmates, it&rsquo;s normal in rural Mexico.  That&rsquo;s also why some of the Mexicans who actually do value education, rather than just saying so, let their daughters know that there will be no Quincenera, no birthday party, at 15.  </p>

			<p>It is absolutely false to say that 84 percent of Latino teens and 91 percent of their parents believe that a college education is important.  If you look at their graduation rates, they don&rsquo;t even think that a high school diploma is important.  </p>

			<p>Diversity - it&rsquo;s a &#8220;quinceanera,&#8221; which is a nice event that often end with stabbings and other drunken mayhem.  The girls put on their finery, the men their newest Raiders jerseys or other prison-inspired gang wear, rap music blares&hellip;it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.<br>
As to what the ultimate message of the event is, I side with your interpretation.</p>
<p>This article should have been tacked ont the end of today&rsquo;s first article.  These people will want Daddy Government to pay for their offspring, and as noted under that story the Reps will never outflank the Dems to the left. </p>

			<p>ST, RC:</p>
<p>I looked it up.  QuinceaÃ±os (ALT+0241 to make the special &#8220;n&#8221;) literally translates to &#8220;15 years.&#8221;  QuinceaÃ±era translate to the young lady who has turned 15 years old.  Without the special &#8220;n,&#8221; it means, to put it sensitively and charitably, 15 &#8220;backsides&#8221; and a young lady with 15 backsides, respectively.  Which is why I am extremely careful with spelling and enunciation when I refer to these concepts.  I&rsquo;m not about to insinuate to the Mex.-Am. brother or father of a 15-year old that I think their sister/daughter has 15 &#8220;behinds,&#8221; I rather like living.</p>
<p>The &#8220;official&#8221; interpretation of the ceremony is the innocuous one.  That is why I think both of you are right, as &#8220;official&#8221; America wants to cover up the truth.</p>

<p>It is this high birth rate that will cause us great suffering, due to overpopulation and dwindling natural resources because of it.</p>
<p>Mexico will be hit much harder by the population bomb. (And the economic plummet.)</p>
<p>These uncertain times is no time to be increasing families, since there could well be mass starvation going on in a very few years.  That, of course, will mean an even more intense migration here from Mexico, making our situation even worse.  There&rsquo;s will be catastrophic.</p>
<p>We should be encouraging the stabalization of our population instead of adding to it.  How many more jobs will we lose in the next three years?  How will these people feed their families?</p>
<p>This is no exaggeration.<br>

			<p>There was a hispanic woman in our city whose 12 year old daughter had a baby.  Because the girl was so young CPS investigated.  Turned out that the Mother ran a boarding house for hispanic men.</p>
<p>Her 3 young daughters were part of the anemities offered to the tenants.</p>
<p>Such a rich culture.</p>

			<p>Why the incredulity here?  The tacit strategy if you cannot outsmart or militarily defeat a population is to out breed it.  The race is on.  In many small towns throughout the Carolinas, 80% of the births have Hispanic parents.  Draw your own conclusions as to who really pays for this, now and later.</p>
<p>But, check the obits.  Obviously, these people either live forever or just prefer not to be buried in U.S. soil.  That alone should tell us why they want our citizenship.</p>

<p>No argument there. We&rsquo;ve had several young Hispanic females in our firm. All of them amply demonstrating the above statistic.</p>
<p>Another statistic of interest: MOST Hispanics, male or female, are not above doing a theft of opportunity or other &#8220;petty&#8221; crime. We recently fired a Hispanic female, a ten-year employee of our firm&hellip; for you guessed it&hellip; THEFT!</p>
<p>Nor is it far from uncommon, for Hispanics to steal from employers as readily as they&rsquo;ll steal from anyone else. Seems to be part of the Mexican psyche, from all indications. Stealing is OK&hellip; as long as you don&rsquo;t get caught!</p>

			<p>Yesterday we got the sad news that our friends spectacularly beautiful daughter, age 20, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and died in less than a week.</p>
<p>This, along with a lifetime of observation causes me to suspect that white American girls, particularly the most beautiful and intelligent, are injected with something shortly after birth that causes them to be sterile and some to develop cancer.  </p>
<p>Robert Graham managed to facilitate the birth of almost 300 healthy geniuses and many others have bought the oocytes of the beautiful and smart.</p>
<p>If it were not for sabotage&hellip; how else is it that modern endocrinology has failed to give us at least 50 thousand vastly superior children per year?</p>

<p>But humans are supposed to have some intelligence and not breed like rats.  If young Whites simply immitate the Hispanic cultural habits of childbearing over life planning, we will simpl be awash in poor, uneducated criminal-by-neccessity class sooner.</p>
<p>How about making abortion mandatory for under age females?  It may be against your &#8220;religion&#8221; but drastic solutions will either have to come soon enough to help, or arrive to late and in a very totalitarian style.  We should be screaming at the UN and WHO to do something now about the third world population explosion, rather than imagining we can successfully decide to outbreed them.  Of course, all that cheap labor is just too tempting to the international capitalists.</p>
<p>Quantity is always the enemy of quality.  The more people we have on earth the lower the human acheivement standard will fall regardless of race or national origin.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got quite a conspiracy theory in progress there.  But there is no need to create one.  In my experience as a health care provider over 25 years, I noticed that beautiful White girls are often subject to sexual abuse by a relative or neighbor very often.  A astonishing high number are raped as their first sexual experience as teens.  One very dear friend of mine now 68, was a beautiful teen who was sexuallyy abused by her father and uncle to the point that she was sterlile and had to have a hysterectomy in her 30s.  An alarming number of beautiful White women of college age are earning money doing porn - if only for a short time.  Often, organ abuse occurs in these filming sessions with objects or very rough sex with oversized organs.  Of course, the worst of these are the interracial sex variety.  What many participants do not understand is that bruising the female organs over and over renders them sterile and highly suseptible to necrosis and cancer later on.  One need look no further than these reasons for the high sterlity rate of young White women.</p>
<p>There is a human sickness in this&hellip; for some reason beauty, especially in human form is felt by the base among us, as something that must be posessed.  Everone loves beauty and but beauty ought to be handled with love and care, not ravaged into extinction.  That is part of the old chivalric culture that we lost in the 20th century.  And it seems that those who feel denied habitually (or politically) of that possession often feel a drive to destroy it as an act of revenge (read &#8220;Soul on Ice&#8221;). Whole cultures may be infected with this compulsion by intent.  The Mayans loved to cut out the hearts of beautiful maidens.  But the sacrifice of a beautiful virgin is the symbology of the Virgin Mary who was surprised to be raped by a &#8220;holy ghost.&#8221; (She wasn&rsquo;t asked, but informed of the act).  Previously, the maiden Leda was raped by the god Zeus who took the form of a swan.  Venus stands as the unattainable beauty out in the heavens as a star - too far to be touched.  But the Romans delighted in inducted beautiful women as the Vestal Virgins and it was death for any man to touch them.  Many young men died this way.  How &#8220;civilization&#8221; loves the spectre of sexual suffering!</p>
<p>Like the young Roman men, we (males) are constantly being teased at all times.  In the tease is a false promise of fulfilment that is then denied.  At least initially.  Old cultures like the Middle Eastern and Persian have belly dancing, but we have pole dancing and Sports Illustrated swimsuit models and all the rest, parading before our eyes every time we turn on a television or see nearly any form of advertising.  Nearly everyone has heard the phrase, &#8220;fatally beautiful.&#8221;  Songs have been written about it.  Marilyn Monroe had a phrase etched on her patio arch - &#8220;cursum perficio,&#8221; - the curse of perfection. But we cannot seem to temper our fascination with beauty and the beautiful with anything near simply good manners.  This week, the MSM briefly announced an investigation in Ireland of thousands of sexually abused children in homes.  I am aware of the old Catholic homes for &#8220;wayward&#8221; girls (girls that could not be supported) and the horrid abuse of them by nuns as child laborers and sexual objects.  Today, what was once the secret practice within religious and public institutions is nearly celebrated while complained about when some victim looses their mind and kidnaps a beautiful person and makes them another victim.  That&rsquo;s right, I see those teased by the over-exposure and over-emphasis of sex as victims too.  Was Ulysses a victim or a would be perpetrator?</p>
<p>In the high chvalric age, women were protected - all women and children were to be protected.  Men were raised to see this as a duty and most women and children depended on them.  In today&rsquo;s bizarre social system, here thanks largely to the feminist movement, women must learn to defend themselves.  But there has been no reduction in the abuse of women and children no matter how many of them learn to &#8220;Foo Fight&#8221; and kick a man in the testicles.  In fact, the abuses and crimes seem to have increased.  This is one reason why I believe that beginning with the outbreak of WW1, world civilization began to fall and continues at an increasing pace.  This is the example of liberty liberating too much.</p>
<p>I apolgize for another diatribe, but there are no simple explanations for the epic problems we face today.</p>

<p>I agree, mostly. However I would add that it isn&rsquo;t too much to ask a young woman to hold off until she&rsquo;s in her early 20s and, one hopes, has completed college or some sort of job training. Early 20s is the ideal time to have kids. Men and women are done with most of their mental and physical growth and have plenty of energy which is best spent raising children, not on all-night partying. The problem is that the television and movie culture - a culture which glamourizes partying and traveling and sleeping around and having a good time - has so insinuated itself into our lives that we fail to recognize its effect on our expectations.</p>
<p>As for young couples: I actually know quite a few people who &#8220;had to&#8221; get married right out of high school. Devout Mormons, all, and all have managed to thrive as couples and succeed economically. Not necessarily without a little help from their parents, but then their parents would&rsquo;ve been helping them through college anyway.</p>
<p>As for these young Mestizas, I paraphrase Whitney Houston: I believe these children are our future. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so worried.</p>

Abortion has done more to decimate the White race than any other thing.  There are those who justify abortion by saying &#8220;every child a wanted child&#8221;, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Many of the world&rsquo;s great thinkers, scientists and philosophers were born and raised under adverse circumstances.  I would like to see a White benefactor reward White families for having many children.<br>
Abortion will assure the extinction of the White race.</p>

Yesterday we got the sad news that our friends spectacularly beautiful daughter, age 20, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and died in less than a week.</p>
<p>This, along with a lifetime of observation causes me to suspect that white American girls, particularly the most beautiful and intelligent, are injected with something shortly after birth that causes them to be sterile and some to develop cancer.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  - You may be a lot closer to the truth than you think. The polio vaccines of the mid 1950s were found to be contaminated with the monkey virus SV40 (vaccine was made from dead monkey kidney cells). Years later, soft tissue cancers which were once rare began to increase.  And it&rsquo;s not a conspiracy theory&hellip; the information can be found on the internet.</p>

			<p>&#8220;How far afield of biology are whites willing to go? The Hispanics are winning the demographic war partly because they have not turned against nature or tried to transform young women into scholars and executives or delay coming of age to the late twenties.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree.  I&rsquo;m a nurse.  According to all the texts the optimum ages for conception and birth is 15 to 26 give or take a year to allow for ethnicity, fat to muscle ratio etc.</p>
<p>The absolute best age to have a child for both mother and baby is 22.  Fertility plummets after the 25 th birthday.  By the time a woman is 30, her fertility is only 40 percent of what it was when she was 20.</p>
<p>The old European way of the man being 10 to 15 years older than the women was the best for everyone.  The man was 27 to 35.  He had whatever career he was going to have.  The woman was 16 to 25, at the peak of her healthy childbearing years.</p>
<p>Men now live longer, they no longer die of a stroke at 45.  Women and babies rarely die in childbirth. But as of the mid 90&rsquo;s when I was in nursing school, the peak ages of fertility had not changed in thousands of years</p>

			<p>&#8220;Yesterday we got the sad news that our friends spectacularly beautiful daughter, age 20, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and died in less than a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her grandmother may have taken a morning sickness pill called Benedicten back in the 1950&rsquo;s.  Thousands of girls whose mothers took this pill died in their early 20&rsquo;s of ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>It could be handed down to the granddaughter.  Do other family members have cancer?  Cancer pretty much runs in families.  If no relatives had cancer, this would be unusual.</p>

			<p>Question Diversity!  Do you live in Kalifornia?  I saw this go one when I was there and have written about it here in the past.  </p>
<p>How can the parents &#8220;say&#8221; they want their kids to go to college and then offer their daughters at fifteen years of age, and yes, Question, it is for the LATTER case.  Mexes speaking out of both sides of their mouth as usual.</p>
<p>Every time I went to the grocery store there were girls who looked like they belonged in high school class, proudly showing off their babies.  Then I&rsquo;d see them in the grocery store with their taxpayer-funded freebie card.   </p>

<p>Not from there.  Native of St. Louis, currently of Carbondale, Illinois, and I had a great uncle that retired to Arizona.  (Come to think of it, everyone has an uncle that retires to Arizona.)  He&rsquo;s the one who schooled me on the facts of life when it comes to our southern neighbors.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the last election for Governor he voted in was in 2002.  He voted for the most conservative candidate, the one that proudly and loudly pronounced their pro-gun credentials, was against immigration amnesty, and while this candidate was pro-abortion, the candidate also had moderate qualifiers on the issue.</p>
<p>The candidate&rsquo;s name?</p>
<p>Janet Napolitano.</p>
<p>All the more ironic considering the DHS &#8220;extremism&#8221; reports that Mark Potok wrote and s/he issued.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;It&rsquo;s not what she wanted&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I disagree with this statement based on my experience in the schools.</p>
<p>Mestizos from Mexico and Central America, according to Professor Lynn, have an average group IQ of approximately 90.  I suspect the latest batch of immigrants, Mixtec- and Nauatl-speaking Mexican Indians, have even lower IQs.  </p>
<p>The prevailing false dogma of NCLB, however, states that there ARE no IQ differences between racial/ethnic groups, that ALL children can learn all subjects equally well  &mdash;  and if they don&rsquo;t, it is due to prevailing White racism.</p>
<p>Recently, here in LA, with its hispanic-majority school population, the bar has been raised to include an exit exam (CaHSEE in California), and Algebra II as requirements for a high school diploma. </p>
<p>Hispanics, once they reach high school and are required to take algebra, geometry and other subjects they cannot comprehend (some of my colleagues teach basic algebra and speak of the enormous frustration of trying to teach those who cannot understand past the first step of a multi-step equation or the concept of a variable).  In other words, the hispanics are in over their heads and they know it.  Is it any wonder their drop-out rates are reported at 50-60%?</p>
<p>What to do?  If one is a male, the answer is to drop out and join your male relatives in the cash-based construction trades.  If one is a female, the answer is to get pregnant in order to reap the full benefits of a fully tax-payer funded life including Section 8 housing, food stamps, WIC, Head Start, medi-caid/Cal, however pitiful that may be.  </p>
<p>The young female&rsquo;s life-long career is motherhood  &mdash;  and why not, everyone else around them is doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Of course, this monstrous tax burden is never ever mentioned by the legislature when determining what to do about the massive budget deficit  &mdash;  the answer is always to raise taxes, as they just did.   Now, the government idiots are looking at a parcel tax and taxes imposed on services as the latest way to punish White producers and drive them out of the state. </p>

			<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not what she wanted&#8221;.</p>
<p>Does that absurd statement imply the girl wasn&rsquo;t having intercourse?</p>
<p>Never fear.  I&rsquo;m certain there is some way the folks conducting this &#8220;study&#8221; can attach the blame to white men.</p>

			<p>Accodring to a sunday May 24 AP article, California will run out of money within 2 months.</p>
<p>I say good.  I live in California.  I am White.  I am poor.  I have been totally excluded from all the government benefits that should be available to all.  My income qualifies me for such things as food stamps and medi-cal.  But my race disqualifies me.</p>
<p>So all I can say is good.  Let the blacks, hispanics and wealthy Asians who get every welfare benefit going because Whites are excluded suffer.  Unfortunately, Obama will probably bail us out and all those affiramtive action non White immigrant government<br>
workers will keep their jobs.</p>
<p>When I applied for food stamps, the first worker was an asian man who did not speak a word of English.  I was approved for food stamps, but for some strange reason, I never got them although I made numerous trips to report the error, if it was an error.</p>
<p>Unemployment is now on the internet, not in person.  I only had to go to an office once during the 9 months.  The office was small, only 4 black women.  Every one spoke with an accent.  Every one wore a name tag with an African name.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even have unemployment in Africa!  What are African women doing working in a California unemployment office?</p>
<p>You might ask why I was unemployed?  The company, a government contractor no less laid us Americans off and brought in a gang of 4ft8 Indian tribesmen who spoke neither Spanish nor English but some tribal language.</p>
