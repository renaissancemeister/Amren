<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30471035/">Mexico Says Flu Ebbing, Lowers Alert Level</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, May 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mexican officials lowered their flu alert level in the capital on Monday and said they will allow cafes, museums and libraries to reopen this week. World health officials said there were no plans to raise the pandemic alert to the highest level.</p>
<p>Mexican officials declared the epidemic to be waning, announcing that Wednesday will conclude a five-day closure of nonessential businesses that was called to stop the spread of the new virus. Health officials need to finish inspecting schools before students can return to class.</p>
<p>Meantime, global health experts said it was too early for countries to lower their guard, but there was still no evidence of community-level spread of the new flu H1N1 virus outside North America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Mexico decries discrimination</b></p>
<p>While Mexico began its first steps toward normalcy, the virus spread to Colombia in the first confirmed case in South America, where flu season is about to begin. More cases were confirmed in North America and Europe  &mdash;  including Portugal&rsquo;s first  &mdash;  with the total number sickened worldwide rising to more than 1,000 people in 20 countries, according to health and government officials.</p>
<p>With the scope of the disease unknown, several countries have taken urgent measures against arriving Mexicans or those who have recently traveled to Mexico.</p>
<p>In China, 71 Mexicans have been quarantined in hospitals and hotels, Foreign Secretary Patricia Espinoza said. Arriving Mexicans were taken into isolation, said Mexico&rsquo;s ambassador, Jorge Guajardo. Even the Mexican consul in Guangzhou was briefly held after returning from a vacation in Cambodia.</p>
<p>And in Hong Kong, 350 people remained isolated Monday in a hotel after a Mexican traveler there was determined to have swine flu.</p>
<p>Mexican President Felipe Calderon complained of the backlash against Mexicans abroad, and his government said a chartered plane left Monday morning for China and will make stops in several cities to pick up any Mexican citizen wanting to return home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s unfair that because we have been honest and transparent with the world some countries and places are taking repressive and discriminatory measures because of ignorance and disinformation,&#8221; Calderon said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are always people who are seizing on this pretext to assault Mexicans, even just verbally,&#8221; he said, though he did not point to any country.</p>
<p>Espinoza planned to talk to Chinese officials about their policy toward Mexicans.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry denied it was discriminating against Mexicans.</p>
<p>But the Mexican Embassy in Beijing sent a circular out to all its citizens saying China had imposed &#8220;measures of unjustified isolation&#8221; in response to swine flu and urging trips there to be canceled or postponed.</p>
<p>Espinoza also criticized Argentina, Peru and Cuba for banning flights to Mexico, and said Argentina was sending a plane to Mexico on Monday to pick up Argentines who want to leave Mexico.</p>
<p>Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova said at a news conference Monday that Mexico had 727 cases of swine flu and 26 deaths from the virus.</p>

Arriving Mexicans were taken into isolation, said Mexico&rsquo;s ambassador, Jorge Guajardo. Even the Mexican consul in Guangzhou was briefly held after returning from a vacation in Cambodia.&#8221;</p>
<p>What was so terrible about that, anyway?  We used to quarantine immigrants at Ellis Island when they showed signs of transmissible disease.  Do you hear any of their descendants complaining about it today?</p>
<p>Kudos to the Chinese for using commonsense tactics to halt the spread of disease, even if it does hurt the feelings of Mexicans.  It&rsquo;s worth mentioning though, this is the same country that dragged its feet in telling the rest of the world about SARS.</p>

			<p>Of course, liberal Americans are expected to blindly swallow Mexican propaganda and believe the threat is over. I personally cannot bring myself to feel pity for ANYONE travelling to Mexico&hellip; who ends up either robbed, assaulted or kidnapped by locals, or comes down with any type of disease. </p>

<p>Um, Senor Calderon&hellip;they don&rsquo;t really CARE what you think.</p>

			<p>My husband and I stopped going to Mexico almost ten years ago not only on principle (We have no desire to drop one more dime on Mexico&rsquo;s economy) but also for our health and safety&hellip;</p>
<p>The Spanish Flu pandemic, which killed close to 40 million people, started with a mild arrival of a new virus in the spring, disappeared over the summer, and then roared back with a vengeance in August&hellip;  Who&rsquo;s to say that we couldn&rsquo;t have a repeat?</p>
<p>Our government appears to care more about &#8220;the heavy cost of commerce across our southern border&#8221; than the possible cost of human lives - American lives!  </p>
<p>OPEN borders at ALL costs for our global politicians in the White House and the sad part is that they&rsquo;re getting away with it&hellip;</p>

			<p>When did the Mexican government officials become experts on whether or not the disease is starting to diminish? </p>

			<p>Note to Senor Calderon.  The PRC is going to do whatever they want.  Your&rsquo;re not dealing with the USA.  </p>

			<p>I guess when everyone isolates their countries from Mexico, except for us, then we know where the highest number of deaths from the swine/mexican flu will be.  I choose to isolate my family from mexican restaurants, and some of the businesses where they tend to congregate en masse.  And, if this flu acts at all like the 1918 pandemic, it is this coming fall and winter we need to beware of&hellip;.</p>

<p>Calderon doesn&rsquo;t get it. The Chinese are not white, they are not politically correct. Like Mexicans and other non-whites, they will look after their own race and nation and not care what you think. As such, they will quarantine your people to stop the spread of disease and use common sense, something whites used to have.</p>

			<p>The Mexicans can howl discrimination all they wish but the Chinese aren&rsquo;t wallowing in racial guilt like white Americans.  Of course the Mexican government is very hypocritical; if there was a virus outbreak in China I doubt Mexico would allow Chinese planes to land at their airports.    </p>

			<p>Considering that <i>thousands</i> of people die each year from various types of influenza, I believe the danger of this outbreak of flu, whatever its name, is greatly overrated and that reactions to it have been panicky. That said, however, each sovereign state has a duty to its own inhabitants to take whatever action it deems necessary to protect them against the spread of infectious diseases from abroad. The communist government of China is certainly well within its rights to quarantine people who are arriving from any country where communicable diseases have been reported, including the United States. In another <i>news story</i>, the Filipino government has ordered boxing champ and national hero Manny Pacquiao &#8220;to delay his triumphant return to the Philippines as a precaution against the spread of swine flu from the United States.&#8221; This is certainly an unpopular action and may very well be unnecessary, but &#8220;better safe than sorry&#8221;!</p>
