<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} [Supreme Court nominee Sonia] Sotomayor&rsquo;s dissenting opinion in a 2006 felon-voting case should make senators extremely wary of confirming her for the high court.</p>
<p>In Hayden v. Pataki, a number of inmates in New York state filed suit claiming that because blacks and Latinos make up a disproportionate share of the prison population, the state&rsquo;s refusal to allow them ballot access amounts to an unlawful, race-based denial of their right to vote. Eight of 13 judges on the liberal-leaning Second Circuit dismissed their arguments, and the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled likewise in a similar case.</p>
<p>Yet, operating on a dubious and extremely broad reading of the Voting Rights Act, Ms. Sotomayor dissented from the decision. In a remarkably dismissive, four-paragraph opinion, she alleged that the &#8220;plain terms&#8221; of the Voting Rights Act would allow such race-based claims to go forward.</p>
<p>Judge Jose Cabranes, who like Ms. Sotomayor was appointed by President Bill Clinton, didn&rsquo;t find the matter to be so clear. His majority decision against the criminal felons, in favor of the state, comprised 36 tightly reasoned pages. Particularly compelling is the fact that the Voting Rights Act was passed to help further the aims of the Constitution&rsquo;s 14th and 15th Amendments. The 14th Amendment specifically allows states to deny the vote to those convicted of crimes.</p>
<p>Ms. Sotomayor is thus in the position of asserting that Congress can prohibit New York from doing something the Constitution itself specifically endorses. {snip}</p>
<p>As almost every state has done since the United States was founded, New York forbids currently incarcerated or paroled prisoners from voting. {snip}</p>

		<p>The only two states that don&rsquo;t allow convicted felons to vote at all are Florida and Kentucky.  In every other state, you can vote as a convicted felon as long as you&rsquo;re not incarcerated or on parole or probation.  As Michael Scott so acutely pointed out here several weeks ago, so many black and Hispanic men (in New York, &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; means mostly black, Afro-Caribbeans) have trouble obeying the terms of their parole/probation and finishing it.</p>
<p>I find it curious that the NAACP and other similar organizations, when they complain about states that don&rsquo;t allow felons to vote at all, only complain about Florida, and never Kentucky.  Why?  Answer:  Florida is a swing state, Kentucky is reliably red, in Presidential politics.</p>

		<p>I do not oppose ex felons voting-they can in most states, but I do oppose illegal aliens voting-which is what this racist Reconquistador will likely support.</p>

		<p>I wonder how the GOP is going to approach this &#8220;Delicate&#8221; subject without risking alienating the mythical Hispanic conservative juggernaut they hope to one day call their base?</p>

		<p>America originally had strict franchise requirements (property-owning white males). And even then, there were no direct elections for senators or the president.  The reason was simple:  Fear of mob rule.  Greek philosophers, most notably Plato, warned us.  I have no doubt he will be proven right.      </p>

		<p>Of course Sotomayor wants convicted felons to vote.  Studies and polling shows that about 80% of felons would vote for the Democrats.  </p>

<p>There are actually some other states which also totally prohibit convicted felons from voting, but not many.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m guessing that if incarcerated felons are allowed to vote, they&rsquo;ll probably vote at a much higher rate than the general population and become a powerful voting block. After all, the registration forms and ballots will be brought right to them and they&rsquo;ve got little else to do. </p>

		<p>I <i>guarantee</i> that the great majority of Republican Senators, fearful of offending Hispanics. will vote to put Sotomayor on the Supreme Court.  The Republicans are an utterly useless opposition.  We know that Democrats are against us, but there is nobody for us.</p>

		<p>IMO - commit and convicted of ANY crime = loss of voting rights.  After the legally determined debt to society is paid (and wasn&rsquo;t capital) voting rights restored.</p>
<p>Too simple</p>
