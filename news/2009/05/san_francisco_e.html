<h1>San Francisco Educators Hail Jimi Hendrix As Role Model for Teachers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FOXNews, May 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Is the San Francisco school district in a purple haze?</p>
<p>The district has chosen a highly unusual role model to grace the cover of its new education guide, and some residents are questioning whether the choice sends a good message to the city&rsquo;s youth.</p>
<p>On the cover of the new district guidebook  &mdash;  aimed at changing the educational &#8220;experiences for every child in each of our schools&#8221;  &mdash;  is a portrait of 1960s rock legend Jimi Hendrix, known as much for his fatal drug habit as his revolutionary take on rock music.</p>
<p>The district&rsquo;s manifesto asks readers to remember &#8220;the first time you heard Jimi Hendrix,&#8221; before proclaiming &#8220;our plan is as transformational now as his music was then,&#8221; according to a report in the San Francisco Chronicle.</p>
<p>But the image of Hendrix  &mdash;  who didn&rsquo;t make it through high school  &mdash;  is not limited to the cover. Indeed, Hendrix&rsquo;s face appears on nearly every page of the manual, which also comes with a Hendrix poster and canvas tote, all distributed to hundreds of administrators in Superintendent Carlos Garcia&rsquo;s district.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jim Dierke, the principal of the Visitacion Valley Middle School told FOX News Wednesday that he supported the initiative {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is another silly political statement that somehow we should hold people like Jimi Hendrix up as an agent of change,&#8221; Gary Delagnes, president of the city&rsquo;s Police Officers&rsquo; Association told FOX News Wednesday. &#8220;Jimi Hendrix was nothing more than a talented musician who died overdosing on drugs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Born in 1942, Hendrix rose to fame after delighting audiences with an innovative, experimental sound and his remarkable skill as a guitarist. His shows often included outrageous stunts such as playing the guitar with his teeth or lighting it on fire. He was named the No. 1 Greatest Guitarist of All Time in Rolling Stone&rsquo;s top-100 list.</p>
<p>His success was legendary, but short-lived: he died at the age of 27 when he choked on his own vomit after a drug overdose.<br>

			<p>You might ask Pete Townsend of the Who about Jimi.  <br>
Mr. Townsend contends that ol&rsquo; Jimi S-T-O-L-E the idea of his<br>
style of guitar playing from Jeff Beck.<br>

			<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that Hendrix was a first class hard rock guitarist. How this translates into being a role model in school puzzles me, unless they now have hard rock classes.</p>

			<p>If liberals want their own children to emulate Mr Hendrix, let them.  Are there any normal White children in Frisco anymore?  I&rsquo;ve been there a couple times, and don&rsquo;t recall seeing any.</p>

			<p>There ARE worse role models than Jimi Hendrix.  He was peaceful and not racial in the least.  I read a great quote about him recently  &mdash;  someone said that whenever a lady walked into the room, Jimi would &#8220;shoot to his feet and greet her.&#8221;  <br>
I think the problem with the school district&rsquo;s plan is that people like Hendrix are literally one in a billion.  The real role models they should push are the people who get up in the morning, go to work, pay their taxes, and stay with their families.  But those people aren&rsquo;t cool or sexy, so no one pays attention to them.</p>

			<p>I think that hendrix was very much over-rated as a musician . <br>
His fame is mostly just political . He was a &#8221; media construct &#8221; </p>
<p>These guys always seem to end up broke or deceased &hellip;<br>
If hendrix had lived on, he would NOT have been the legend that he was made to be . He probably would have ended up in a housing project after he was &#8220;exploited&#8221; for a brief time . </p>

			<p>I never believe the public &#8216;persona&rsquo; created about these figures by the media. At the same time, I met a disk jockey who said he met Hendrix in person and he mentioned Hendrix was pretty stoned when he met him. </p>

Jimi Hendrix would sometimes show up to a concert so stoned that he couldn&rsquo;t perform. </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want that behavior in our school teachers, probably.</p>

			<p>Kerr - you are totally wrong, Hendrix was a revolutionary guitarist, a fantastic musician with that &#8220;magic touch.&#8221; I believe he was also half white. </p>
<p>Hendrix might not be a perfect &#8220;role model&#8221; but I&rsquo;m sure there are many guitarists on this board who would agree that his musicianship was excellent. </p>

			<p>Jimi Hendrix once said that LSD inspired his music. His manager then said that the next time you take LSD, could you find some lyrics.<br>
   His lyrics were strange. He was more original than his contemporaries. The music was good the first two albums, They were tight and had interesting melodies even if the lyrics didn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Lastly, how quickly SF has forgotten Jerry Garcia. Oh well.</p>

			<p>I guess any madness is possible when you start with the premise that the majority of blacks are capable of being as good students as the majority of whites, if you can only find the magic key to unlock black students&rsquo; stifled intellectual potentialities.</p>

			<p>As an ex-professional guitarist, and a young hippie wannabe in the &rsquo;60s, I remember how the world changed when Hendrix came out with &#8220;Purple Haze.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Whatever else he was, he was a guitar genius.  I saw him perform twice and am a living witness. He took music, and us along with him, to places we had never been and may never go again.</p>
<p>My politics have turned around 180 degrees since those days (and I truly regret much of the negative impact &rsquo;60s leftism had on our society), but I&rsquo;ll always be indebted to Jimi for sharing his &#8220;experience,&#8221; even though he may never have been able to live up to the expectations of us lowly mortals.</p>

<p>C&rsquo;mon - maybe he did, but without a talent he would not have been able to actually perform it. He was brilliant guitar player, but as a role model he is not exactly a good choice. It&rsquo;s like making a positive role model from, say, Jim Morrison or Janis Joplin. Iconic - yes, but for education purposes definitely not.</p>

			<p>Jimi Hendrix is certainly a better role model than, for example, that Shabaaz guy or MLK. While home on TDY for the D.C. riots in early 68&rsquo; on my way back to Viet-Nam and in L.A. at a club I met and drank beer with Jimi Hendrix (he was buying, I was in uniform) a very decent guy, and he said that despite what people said of him, he was NOT anti war or anti military. He is/was PRO America, he DID NOT call himself AFRICAN American and his music was very, very popular in Viet-Nam.</p>

			<p>Just consult his biography (which is not a bad one as movie bio&rsquo;s go), Jimi Hendrix &#8220;wasn&rsquo;t much of a color talker.&#8221;</p>
<p>And one of the above posters was exactly right - Hendrix was quite literally one in a billion.  He is now being reconstructed by many blacks, and the usual group of self-hating Whites, for political purposes.  And though he was an insecure man (the result of a broken home) who did drift for a time into a &#8220;black thing&#8221;, it was short lived.<br>
Fact is, Jimi liked White people and had no problem with them.</p>
<p>For myself JH is a personal favorite.  In fact, though it might be sacriligious to say it here, he&rsquo;s one of my favorite Americans - ever. </p>
<p>Oh, and photos of his mother make it clear that there was a lot of White blood in Jimi&rsquo;s veins.  Just as his dad&rsquo;s reveals some American Indian.  Also - as George Harrison said about Brian Epstein, &#8220;everybody was topping themselves off in those days&#8221;.  Comments of his drug use after the fact are easy. And if he was careless with what he took the man certainly paid the price.  </p>

			<p>Mr hendrix was in the 101st AB. He was pro military and supported the war in vietnam- this is according to Eric Burton. Not supportive enough to reenlist, but more supportive than your average celebraty at the time. I also looked through his albums. When he played with the two white englishmen, he sounded good. When he was forced to play with blacks, he went downhill.</p>

			<p>I was a huge Hendrix fan, but he&rsquo;s no kind of role model.</p>

			<p>To echo a previous poster:there are worse role models than Jimi Hendrix.Although it strikes me silly that a school has to reach out to pop culture for a role model.</p>
<p>I do like some of Jimi&rsquo;s music.He was a talented musician and a fine songwriter.I&rsquo;m not quite old enough to remember Hendrix,but I&rsquo;ve seen print and video interviews with him.He came across as a sweet and gentle person.It&rsquo;s clear Jimi didn&rsquo;t view himself as simply black.He embraced his multi-racial background.He was especially pround of his Native American heritage.His grandmother had helped raise jimi;she was Native American.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very unfortunate that the black radicals laid such a guilt trip on Jimi Hendrix.Because he was a &#8220;black&#8221; artist playing to primarily  white audiences,they told him he had sold out.The criticism caused him a lot of stress;maybe if they had left him alone he&rsquo;d still be alive today.</p>
<p>Regarding Jeff Beck:I&rsquo;m a JB fan.From what I&rsquo;ve read,Jeff does believe he influenced Hendrix&rsquo;s style of playing.I doubt if Jeff would consider it &#8220;stealing&#8221;,though. When it comes to popular music,it&rsquo;s an accepted fact that there&rsquo;s a lot of &#8220;borrowing.&#8221; Everyone sort of borrows from everyone else.That&rsquo;s also how different musical genres were created.<br>

			<p>His music was good, but I&rsquo;m not exactly certain that setting up a herion addict who died of an overdose as a role model for children is a good idea.</p>

			<p>Had he lived Jimi Hendrix would be 67 years old.  Who is he supposed to inspire?  The young and middle aged teachers who are the ages of any children or grandchildren he might have?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see the students identifying with a man from the &#8220;olden days&#8221;, a man who if he lived would be older than many of their grandparents.</p>
<p>SFUSD is what, about 70 percent Asian?  I can&rsquo;t see that ethnic group identifying with Hendrix in any way.</p>
<p>The only SFUSD group that might know anything about Hendrix is the retired teachers groups, old hippies. </p>
