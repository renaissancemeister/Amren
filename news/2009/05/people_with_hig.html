<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>People with higher measures of cognitive ability are more likely to make good choices in several different types of economic decisions, according to a new study with researchers from the University of Minnesota&rsquo;s Twin Cities and Morris campuses.</p>
<p>The study, set to be published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this week, was conducted with 1,000 trainee truck drivers at Schneider National, Inc., an American motor carrier employing 20,000. The researchers measured the trainees&rsquo; cognitive skills and asked them to make choices in several economic experiments, and then followed them on the job.</p>
<p>People with better cognitive skills, in particular higher IQ, were more willing to take calculated risks and to save their money and made more consistent choices. They were also more likely to be cooperative in a strategic situation, and exhibited higher &#8220;social awareness&#8221; in that they more accurately forecasted others&rsquo; behavior.</p>
<p>The researchers also tracked how trainees persevered on their new job. The company paid for the training of those who stayed a year, but those who left early owed thousands in training costs. The study found that those with the highest level of cognitive ability stayed at twice the rate of those with the lowest.</p>
<p>The finding that individual characteristics that improve economic success  &mdash;  patience, risk taking and effective social behavior  &mdash;  all cluster together and are linked through cognitive skill, which could have implications for policy making and education.</p>
<p>&#8220;These results could shed light on the causes of differential economic success among individuals and among nations,&#8221; said University of Minnesota-Twin Cities economist Aldo Rustichini, a co-author whose theoretical work on cognitive skills is used in the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;It also suggests that the benefit from early childhood education programs not only affects cognitive skills, but extends to more effective economic decision-making,&#8221; said study co-author Stephen Burks, the University of Minnesota-Morris economist who organized the project that gathered the data.</p>

<p>Economic analysis has so far said little about how an individual&rsquo;s cognitive skills (CS) are related to the individual&rsquo;s economic preferences in different choice domains, such as risk taking or saving, and how preferences in different domains are related to each other. Using a sample of 1,000 trainee truckers we report three findings. First, there is a strong and significant relationship between an individual&rsquo;s CS and preferences. Individuals with better CS are more patient, in both short- and long-run. Better CS are also associated with a greater willingness to take calculated risks. Second, CS predict social awareness and choices in a sequential Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma game. Subjects with better CS more accurately forecast others&rsquo; behavior and differentiate their behavior as a second mover more strongly depending on the first-mover&rsquo;s choice. Third, CS, and in particular, the ability to plan, strongly predict perseverance on the job in a setting with a substantial financial penalty for early exit. Consistent with CS being a common factor in all of these preferences and behaviors, we find a strong pattern of correlation among them. These results, taken together with the theoretical explanation we offer for the relationships we find, suggest that higher CS systematically affect preferences and choices in ways that favor economic success.</p>

			<p>I can think of a number of high IQ, well educated White people who have recently lost their jobs to Asians in California.  I expect they will be forced to make less wise economic choices in their futures since their regular income has disappeared.</p>

			<p>While this study may have some basis in truth. The fact is that some of us get far too preoccupied with IQ&rsquo;s. It has been my experience that for every person I have met with an IQ who was mentally stable and socially functional I have met two other people who lack commonsense, people skills and are virtually cranks and social misfits.</p>
<p>While there is nothing wrong with studying IQs at some level, we should nto get too invested in treating them as gospel.  </p>

			<p>These findings are truly astonishing and entirely counter-intuitive.  Who would have suspected that there is actually a correlation between intelligence and good economic decisions and even overall success?</p>
<p>Certainly not our legislatures, which have worked tirelessly to stamp out racism, sexisim, smartism, successism, and equal opportunityism in America. </p>
<p>In fact, the suggestion that intelligence and success are somehow related is so absurd on its face that those proselytizing<br>
this vicious and socially corrosive theory should face prosecution.</p>

			<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take an Albert Einstein to figure out this one. How many moron millionaires do you know ? Most people are brain dead and can&rsquo;t see beyond their noses. Most can&rsquo;t extrapolate the consequences of their actions five minutes into the future. If it feels good, do it. When they suffer the consequences they want the government to bail them out.</p>

<p>But IQ is almost entirely genetic and almost totally unmalleable.  This is the old discredited canard about head start, except that head start is given to kids at the time in their lives when black children are ahead of white children in mental development.</p>

			<p>While I do agree that higher IQ people on average make more responsible choices, I still know pleny of very intelligent people who are heavily in debt and live beyond their means. Money and things can be very intoxicating, regardless of intelligence.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;People with better cognitive skills, in particular higher IQ, were more willing to take calculated risks and to save their money and made more consistent choices. They were also more likely to be cooperative in a strategic situation, and exhibited higher &lsquo;social awareness&rsquo; in that they more accurately forecasted others&rsquo; behavior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the big surprise here, as usual with social &ldquo;science&rdquo; studies, is not the &ldquo;results&rdquo; obtained, which describe strong relationships between the obvious; what is really surprising here, is the notion that the discernibly evident has been &ldquo;proven.&rdquo; That is, as is &ldquo;reported&rdquo; in the above article by &ldquo;Science Daily.&rdquo; To their credit, the authors of the second article, &ldquo;Abstract: Cognitive Skills Affect Economic Preferences, Strategic Behavior, and Job Attachment,&rdquo; were careful to only report that significant relationships were found between the variables in question.</p>
<p>The more interesting question however (at least for our purposes here at AR) is to consider how the racial aspects of these &ldquo;relationships,&rdquo; might be extrapolated from the data presented? Within that framework, another question does also come into play; this being, would the researchers and all others concerned have been so honest with the relationships of IQ and economic preferences, if the that issue was in play here?</p>
<p>Here at the AR website, we are pretty comfortable acknowledging that it is very likely that nonwhites (blacks and Hispanics, in particular) were probably overrepresented in the low IQ and poor economic preferences group. That tends to be a rather reliable constant of such studies as this one, with the predictable lower socioeconomic and educational outcomes being unsurprising. With that said, with all of that considered, how might all of this data be reinterpreted if the racial aspect were injected into this study?</p>
<p>That is easy to answer: it would all be chalked up to wholly untested and totally unquantifiable factors such as, &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; or &ldquo;pervasive discrimination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, this would likely be cast into the terms of &ldquo;proof&rdquo; by all parties considered, be they researchers or reporters.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

			<p>These people began with the idea that all races are equal.  Their mission is to find the secret cause of the inequality.  They think they are Louis Pasture and they will find the cause and cure for minority lower intelligence.  Stephen Burks knows it&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p> &ldquo;&lsquo;It also suggests that the benefit from early childhood education programs not only affects cognitive skills, but extends to more effective economic decision-making,&rsquo; said study co-author Stephen Burks, the University of Minnesota-Morris economist who organized the project that gathered the data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where did Burks get that idea?  No where does it say anything about early childhood education programs.  We know that these programs are worthless as any gain in IQ is soon lost.  The 1985 study that did track Head Start showed that there was an immediate benefit but that was lost after two years. </p>
<p>What the Burks&rsquo; project does do is reaffirm common sense; that smart people don&rsquo;t do dumb things generally.  That is why they are richer.  The only thing that bothers me is, if I&rsquo;m so smart, why ain&rsquo;t I rich?<br>

			<p>Unfortunately, regarding Gary above, I have a genius IQ but have consistently been described as &#8220;one of those totally out to lunch genius types.&#8221; While it&rsquo;s true that I microanlyze my own and others&rsquo; behavior most of the time, I still cannot say anymore that I am a great social actor. So I am not so sure that our intense social analysis and brains helps us all that much in social endeavors, where probably the less you think the better. I&rsquo;ve met quite a few high IQ types who are Einstein-like eccentrics. In fact, it&rsquo;s pretty common for them to have their heads in the clouds.</p>
<p>One problem I have is that I have a hard time controlling my thoughts. It&rsquo;s like I have way too much going on upstairs all the time. To be honest, people really don&rsquo;t appreciate it too much, and I often get told that I&rsquo;m not listening.</p>
<p>Roundabout way of saying the social skills of high IQ types are probably exaggerated.</p>
<p>I am not so sure about the risks stuff. Most dumb people I know love to take stupid risks with their money, and are typically the worse off for it. Most high IQ types are really cautious and conservative to the point of paranoia with their money.</p>
<p>That said, I think there is something to this. I live around a bunch of what I consider to be idiots, and they are broke almost 365 24-7. I probably make less than most of these clowns, but because I have some sense, I almost always have some money on me, no matter how late in the month, so everyone is always hitting me up for &#8220;loans.&#8221; I keep telling them to budget their money but they act like they are incapable. </p>
<p>Dumber people are simply unable to resist the obvious temptations that most of us are tempted by, so they tend to become financial disaster cases. Intelligent low income folks that I know, by contrast, sacrifice and live boring lives, but they still have money at the end of the month and never have their hands out.</p>

<p>Considering the strong arm tactics we have seen recently being used by the government, perhaps we should wonder what sort of an &#8220;offer they couldn&rsquo;t refuse&#8221; was made to the banking officers. We know of one CEO already removed by the FED.</p>

			<p>Some people are definitely way too ocuppied with scores on IQ tests. I have argued many times here that scores on IQ tests are completely irrelevant to the issue of the mass racial replacement of theb majority Native Born White American population. Why would the case for a nationial origins immigration policy that discriminates against Mexicans be significantly weaker if a year from now Mexicans are discovered through IQ testing to have an IQ of 200-every single one of them? The case for discriminating against Mexicans in immigration policy would still be as strong as ever. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It would not be very difficult to use scores on IQ tests to justify the race-replacment of Native Born White Amerians by asians. The fundamental issue is the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans by high fertility post-1965 non-whites. This is the only issue we should be debating-discusing with immigration enthusiasts. It makes things such much more simple.</p>
<p>The  econmetric models and theories of high IQ academic economists are the cause of the curent economic meltdown. So much for a high score on an IQ test.</p>
<p>Asians who score high on an IQ tests are just as much of a threat to Native Born White Amerians as mexicans and central americans.<br>

			<p>I have noticed that several commenters have said that this study is flawed because they know smart people who have made bad economic decisions.  That is like liberals saying that they know a smart black person so all IQ studies must be flawed.  <br>
It is obvious that an intelligent person is more likely to make intelligent economic decisions than a dumb person.  Just look at all the millionaire ghetto atheletes who are broke within years of leaving the NFL.  Where I live it is not uncommon to see blacks or poor whites for that matter, driving expensive SUVs.  If you give an idiot a million dollars they will be broke within 2 years.  This study is just more proof that 90% of studies prove what anyone with common sense already knows.</p>

			<p>Well Land O&rsquo; Goshen!  Who&rsquo;d a thunk it?  Surely this is the first time in Human History that anyone has discovered that smart people tend to do better economically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could shed light on the causes of differential economic success among individuals and among nations.&#8221;  Surely no one has ever published a book with this idea as its central premise (if they did, I imagine the title might be something like IQ AND THE WEALTH OF NATIONS).  And notice that this discovery is considered to possibly have &#8220;implications for policy making and education&#8221;.</p>
<p>My guess it that the powers that be will see it necessary to shape policy and education to &#8216;level the playing field&rsquo;, by penalizing the intelligent, preferring the unintelligent, and, quite possibly, diluting, genetically swamping, and even EXTERMINATING all intelligent people who are not members of the ruling elite.   Oh, wait!  Our benevolent rulers have begun to implement those measures, already.</p>

Honestly how can you say that? Blacks are the most violent and disruptive lot on the face of God&rsquo;s green earth. Hispanics are slightly less violent and slightly less disruptive but make up for it in numbers, proximity to our nation and their rapid growth rate.<br>
East Asians have low birth rates, are less violent than whites (look at our prison statistics) and their homeland is separated from ours by a massive ocean. There is NO threat that California will become majority Chinese. Even if we were to triple the number of Chinese who move here, their birth rates drop and as their income/education levels rise. Can you say the same for Hispanics? <br>
If you&rsquo;re walking down the street and you see on one side, three young black males and on the other, three young east Asian men, which side will you walk on? Do you even, for one microsecond consider to walk on the side with the blacks over the Asians?<br>
I&rsquo;m sure East asians pose a threat to whites in that they can displace them from the upper levels of the economy but that just doesn&rsquo;t come near to the existential threat faced by mexicanization or the constant violence and cultural degradation imposed on us by blacks.</p>

<p>Well, that might be one explanation as to why you remain a committed Marxist, who just can&rsquo;t understand why the influx of nonwhites into California (be they legal or illegal) has destroyed your quality of life there. Or for that matter, why you once wrote a: long, rambling, and totally uncorroborated article, pretentiously asserting that the United States was never a majority white country until the 1800s. </p>

<p>In their different kind of way post-1965 LEGAL asian immigrants have inflicted enormous violence on Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>They are responsible for the ongoing destruction of who knows how many centuries of Native Born White Engineering experience&hellip;and &hellip;the destruction of who knows how many centuries of Native Born White Engineering,scientific and medical talent that will will never be developed and cultivated. They are responsible for transforming Native Born White America into a low skilled low tech society&hellip;the type of societies that are easily conquered and disposed of. What the asians in America are doing in America right now is potentially genocidal.</p>
<p>Invasions should be repelled before a beachhead is established. The LEGAL immigrant asians have established a beachhead and gone over the bluffs to own over 150 members of the US congress. The LEGAL immigrant asian and its &#8220;American&#8221; born geneline has the great potential to inflict an even greater scale of damage on Native Born White Americans than they have already inflicted.</p>
<p>By the way, your comments express a great insensitivity to the thousands of Native Born White American families that already have been severely harmed since 1972 by LEGAL asian immigration. There is no acceptable level of LEGAL IMMIGRANT asian induced damage of Native Born White American families.</p>
<p>When the LEGAL IMMIGRANTS move in and flood a White school system with their geneline, property taxes go through the roof up as high as fifteen thousand a year. Many Native Born White American families are than faced with the option of fleeing their communities or losing their home in a tax lien sale to a legal immigrant asian who is buyng the home as a second home for his son so the son can start an asian geneline in America&hellip;.this at a time when there is a growing population of young Native Born White Males who do not and will not earn enough money to habe their own wife and family. The LEGAL IMMIGRANT asians you are fond of are waging a vicious race war against Native Born White Americans..particularly young Native Born White Males. This is in the realm of genocide also.</p>

			<p>If I may add some comments to those of Frere Jean PM:</p>
<p>Monsieur Lindsay  &mdash;  -I am a member of Mensa, based on my IQ.</p>
<p>The cure for wandering mind syndrome is to do physical work. It can be manual, skilled labor, or artistic labor (like Michaelangelo, who was most assuredly an exhausted man at the end of each artistic day).</p>
<p>The communist Chinese got it right  &mdash;  intellectuals need to be doing manual labor; in their case, in the rice-fields.</p>
<p>Doing manual labor connects you to your physical, mammalian self. You learn what is real. You discard that which has no consequence, such as: &#8220;What if Thor fought Conan?&#8221; or &#8220;What if Nietszche debated Socrates?&#8221; Instead you focus on: &#8220;What is the cure for an aching back?&#8221; and &#8220;Will I be able to perform adequately with my wife tonight (I&rsquo;m pretty tired), after she fixes me a good dinner?&#8221;</p>
<p>Western man has forgotten how to be a mammal; in many cases he is a fake mammal.</p>
<p>Why White people, of high IQ, eschew physical work is beyond me. Why they avoid having multiple offspring (I have three) is beyond me. </p>
<p>What else is there? WHAT ELSE IS THERE  &mdash;  besides working on that which is your own, improving it, making it better,  and reproducing the mixed genetics of your one true love and yourself?</p>
<p>As the saga of South Africa shows, when we get other races to do our phyical work for us, that is the start of the end. </p>
<p>I love work!</p>
<p>J&rsquo;aime travailler! </p>

			<p>John PM: Marx never said the way to make revolution was for the oppressed of the 3rd world to cop out on their duties to transform their own societies and instead, &#8220;make revolution&#8221; by invading the 1st world! The oppressed of all countries must find their own way to liberation within their own borders. The Western Left is quite perverse. They think Whites are evil and practice something called Third Worldism. Marx and even Engels were both what would be called White Supremacists nowadays. That was the normal way for Whites to be back then.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an ethnocentric White man and an anti-racist race realist. I know that sounds weird, but in the near future you will see more Whites like me.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t take an Albert Einstein to figure out this one. How many moron millionaires do you know ? Most people are brain dead and can&rsquo;t see beyond their noses. Most can&rsquo;t extrapolate the consequences of their actions five minutes into the future. If it feels good, do it. When they suffer the consequences they want the government to bail them out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by N. J. MOE at 6:36 PM on May 18 </p>
<p>I have known a good number of millionaires in my time.  Mostly as patients.  I lived in the North Bay region of San Francisco for decades and met many of them.  The one thing they had in common was not necessarily intelligence or what we might call a well informed person.  They were all uniformly devoid of an appreciation of ethics and had &#8220;a lot of nerve.&#8221;  They all were church going types, sure that their god sanctioned all their rationalizations around business and life.  Every one of them was divorced, remarried and having an affair.  Their kids were spoiled and almost completely without parental guidance. It was much the same in more conservative regions as the Sacramento Valley and Orange County in So Cal. </p>
<p>The core difference that I have noticed is the ground that different people have to act in.  Legalities aside, it takes &#8220;a lot of nerve&#8221; perhaps more - to be a successful drug lord or even a drug dealer.  It appears to me that just as cops and criminals play the same game on opposite sides, intelligence is required for success in crime.  Is it any surprise that just as the &#8220;legal&#8221; capitalist world collapsed recently and we continue daily with news of yet another bad actor in the financial world, that we also have greedy drug lords who have grown too confident and now have more legal force aiming at them?  The White Collar criminals even had the advantage of the assumption that they were reputable, honest individuals and entities.</p>
<p>This is all just human nature at work; Greed and lust for power, etc.  But the lack of ethics and the use of intelligence seems to be fairly comparable among the legal and illegal occupations in the world where the most money is to be made the quickest.</p>
<p>I think I agree that there are limits to the application of IQ measurements in life&rsquo;s realities.</p>

			<p>To Comrade Lindsay, regarding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;John PM: Marx never said the way to make revolution was for the oppressed of the 3rd world to cop out on their duties to transform their own societies and instead, &lsquo;make revolution&rsquo; by invading the 1st world! The oppressed of all countries must find their own way to liberation within their own borders. The Western Left is quite perverse. They think Whites are evil and practice something called Third Worldism.&rdquo; </p>
<p>As was expected, your &ldquo;rebuttal&rdquo; to my critique of your original post is both prevaricating and more than a little meandering. You defend Marx, but because it isn&rsquo;t convenient for you here to do so (much like your current situation, in your &ldquo;enriched&rdquo; home state,) you underhandedly lambaste multiculturalism. You refuse to admit that you once celebrated (which you have admitted in the past many times here at AR and on your blog,) what might be called &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; diversity or &ldquo;selective&rdquo; liberationist immigration policies for nonwhites into the USA. The only reason that you have reevaluated your Marxist-multicultural  &ldquo;dialectic,&rdquo; is because it has hit you where it hurts; that being, where you live and work, and not somebody else, who you can lookdown your sanctimoniously scarlet nose at. </p>
<p>Indeed, as you note: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Marx and even Engels were both what would be called White Supremacists nowadays. That was the normal way for Whites to be back then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But you are not, not a bit, and you pride yourself on that point; moreover, you hang onto totally absurd concepts as facts, such as that the USA was never majority white until the 1880s, when not even the Reds in the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media would be comfortable making such a wretchedly asinine pronouncement. However, you will make such self-serving descriptions of yourself as: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an ethnocentric White man and an anti-racist race realist&rdquo; here and now, because you would still like to win some misguided converts to your filthy Red ideology and cause. </p>
<p>Admit it Comrade Lindsay, you look down on true race-realists and white nationalists as a group, simply because we have the guts and brains to, at the very least, unapologetically want to survive your kinds&rsquo; perverted Red version of &ldquo;social-evolutionary progress.&rdquo; </p>
<p>John PM!</p>

			<p>Most everyone here is familiar with a standard distribution, or &#8220;bell&#8221; curve, particularly as it applies to intelligence.  All other human qualities are also distributed the same way.  Virtue, however you choose to define or measure it, is not shared equally among individuals.  Just as half the people are dumber than average, so are half the people less honest, less self-disciplined, or less caring than average.  There&rsquo;s no reason to assume that these character traits, whether caused by nature or nurture, are related to intelligence.  For many of these people who are above average in intelligence and below average in character, their brains are simply a means to steal more, waste more, or hurt more.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessarily true that highly intelligent people are more likely to be thieves, fools, or traitors, just that when they are, they stand out.  </p>

			<p>J&rsquo; aime Travailler is on to something.  Too many really smart kids are allowed to live in imaginary worlds, the classroom and the computer.  Parents will tell them Your job is school.  No chores, no part time jobs, and no injuries from contact with unforgiving physical reality, except perhaps in a soccer league with more adult supervision than a church social.  They are as well insulated from reality as their parent&rsquo;s money can make them.  They think Blacks are cool, and that life should be easy.  They are children for life.  Even universities, founts of leftist folly, have recognized this.  They have to create what are essentially academic resorts to attract the spoiled brats whose parents&rsquo; money keep the bills paid, and they&rsquo;ve come up with these &#8220;What a hard life I&rsquo;ve had&#8221; application essays to try to find students who won&rsquo;t cry when they get a B on a paper.  <br>
     But physical Work is the great teacher.  A nail does not care if you&rsquo;re rich, if you&rsquo;re a bedwetter, or if you&rsquo;re a Mexican.  Can you drive it in straight?  Oak is not pine, aluminum is not steel, and you will adapt to those facts or you will not get your work done.  The indifference of physical objects to our feelings forces a mind to submit to reality, a most valuable lesson.  Were I the Queen of Outer Space, no one would be awarded a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree without demonstrating competence in some manual skill.</p>

			<p>John PM: You are right that previously I was a hypocrite. I never even cared about illegals 3 years ago and was in favor of mass amnesty for all 12 million of them. This is because I always lived in all-White towns and never had to deal with them. Now that I live in the Diversity I have changed my mind.</p>
<p>I am indeed a pro-White anti-racist race realist. You don&rsquo;t have to believe me. Come on over to the site and ask the commenters. They&rsquo;ll all agree with me. It&rsquo;s somewhat sui generis at the moment, but I am already starting to see some pro-White anti-racist Whites, mostly young males. Their politics is confused, but it&rsquo;s a good trend. They are reacting to all of the White-bashing and White-hatred in society by defending themselves. </p>
<p>I propose a pro-White analogue to organizations like the NAACP, the Urban League, NC on La Raza, MALDEF, LULA, etc. These are good anti-racist organizations that do not engage in racist hatred of the other, nor do they promote ethnic supremacism. They just defend their own against discrimination, hate crimes and hate propaganda. </p>
<p>Lamentably, I am not keen on most White nationalists, even though I know some of them. The truth is that almost all WN&rsquo;s are racists, however much they insist they are not. As an anti-racist, obviously I cannot support this. Indeed I am not a White Supremacist. Supremacism is as wrong as narcissism.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t try to convert anyone to Communism. And anyway, even if I were, this would be the last place I would try to do so.</p>
<p>I now acknowledge that the US was probably a majority-White country from Day One of its formation, but I&rsquo;m not so sure about my own state of California. This place has been a multicultural stew from the very start.</p>
<p>I continue to support non-White immigration to the US, of course, just not in such large numbers. And I want it more restrictive. Anyone of any race can be an American.</p>

			<p>Robert Lindsay,</p>
<p>Stephen Hawking stated &#8220;people who boast about their IQs are losers.&#8221; He is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>IQ does correlate with achievement, but is not in itself achievement, or even talent. It is especially useful in predicting the achievement level of large numbers of people, ie group differences, but has less use when it comes to individual outcomes. </p>
<p>Saying IQ implies genius is as stupid as saying a great ability at arm-wrestling makes you the equal of a great footballer, or any other sort of sportsman (after-all, I&rsquo;m sure a positive correlation would exist between arm-wrestling and sporting prowess). </p>
<p>So having an IQ higher than Einstein&rsquo;s does not make you a genius, anymore than beating Muhammad Ali in an arm wrestling contest make you a great sportsman. </p>
<p>Geniuses are recognized as such on account of their achievements. And for those who have achieved a lot, IQ becomes a moot point.</p>

			<p>Genius IQ = 140+</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s well known in intelligence testing circles. </p>
<p>You have to realize that that word means one thing in intelligence testing circles and quite another thing in the way that people casually bandy it about, &#8220;He&rsquo;s a genius.&#8221; To psychometricians, it&rsquo;s just a way of describing a number. Don&rsquo;t get all caught up in semantic games.</p>
<p>What I think is really interesting is that in Blacks, females are 7-8X more likely to have a genius IQ (described above) than males. What kind of sense does that make?</p>

<p>Excellent post. On the Science channel over a year ago, there was an interesting show. It was a show about what would happen if an altrnative IQ test was given. People with very different backgrouunds were chosen. Several of them were chosen for there extremely high IQ scores that well over 130-people such as MITs Llyod-related to Bertrand Russel-a expert on quantum computation and quantum computers, a hedge fund manager with an IQ of 160,a world renown classcial piano prodigy with an exttremly high IQ, a english artists who and math cripple who dropped out of school at 14 years of age, a black playwright, a russian female classical piano player. The were giving a series of cognitive tasks that required skill and ingenuity. The results were fascinating and could not be predicted based upon traditional IQ test score. Professor Seth Llyod, the high IQ hedge fund manager and the young male classical piano player came away with the view that traditional IQ tests were basically worthless and a joke.</p>
<p>The female english artists-school drop out came closets to solving the most difficult challenge. If she had had more confidence in herself she would have completely solved the problem. She completetly blew away the MIT professor of Quantum Physics.</p>

			<p>To Comrade Lindsay, regarding your post at 11:18 PM on May 20:</p>
<p>When I posted my original comments directed at you, I never suspected that you would literally give an actual 7 paragraph treatise, that would prove my point about you engaging in mental summersaults and pirouettes regarding the topic of multiculturalism. I must ask the question, are you really serious about this:</p>
<p>&ldquo; I propose a pro-White analogue to organizations like the NAACP, the Urban League, NC on La Raza, MALDEF, LULA, etc. These are good anti-racist organizations that do not engage in racist hatred of the other, nor do they promote ethnic supremacism. They just defend their own against discrimination, hate crimes and hate propaganda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If so, what planet have you been living on for the last 55 or so years?</p>
<p>For example, you do understand that  the National Council of La Raza, would like to see the entire American Southwest (including California) annexed to Mexico in what they call a &ldquo;reconquista?&rdquo; You also understand, that the NACCP encourages affirmative action and demands &ldquo;reparations&rdquo; for slavery; along with, I must add, being fully open to allowing the invasion from Mexico and the Third World in general to continue? Is this really what the Red abyss that you call your &ldquo;high IQ&rdquo; mind, considers to only be &ldquo;anti-racist&rdquo; or defending &ldquo;their own against discrimination, hate crimes and hate propaganda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If so, you really have not changed at all; you are still the maniacal Marxist troll, that originally saw fit to come here in 2007. Moreover, you claim our side has younger members in &ldquo;political confusion,&rdquo; when you make this type of multicultural mishmash statement, in your conclusion: &ldquo;I continue to support non-White immigration to the US, of course, just not in such large numbers. And I want it more restrictive. Anyone of any race can be an American.&rdquo; </p>
<p>You further observed in your opening salvo to me that: &ldquo;You are right that previously I was a hypocrite&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am afraid Comrade Lindsay, that I remain right on that hypocrisy score of yours and your deeply ingrained Red idiot factor score as well, considering all of the above in toto,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>
