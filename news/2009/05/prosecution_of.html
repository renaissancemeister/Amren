			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dutch News (Amsterdam), May 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Geert Wilders, leader of the anti-Islam party PVV, will definitely be prosecuted for inciting hatred against Muslims and Islam, news agency ANP writes on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A request by Wilders&rsquo; lawyer Bram Moscowicz to have the decision to prosecute quashed has been rejected by the Dutch supreme court.</p>
<p>Amsterdam appeal court said in January Wilders should stand trial for hate speech and discrimination. The public prosecution department had said earlier there were not sufficient grounds to prosecute the MP.</p>
<p>The anti-immigration MP said he expected &#8216;a political trial&rsquo;. &#8216;I am being prosecuted for something millions of Dutch people are thinking.&nsbp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Freedom of speech is being sacrificed on the altar of islam. But I am ready to fight back with my head held high&rsquo;, he added.<br>

			<p>This is horrible.  Freedom of speech is dying because of the liberals.  In France  Actress Brigitte Bardot was prosecuted and convicted for criticizing muslims.  Its coming to the US soon if we don&rsquo;t do something!  Talk to everone you know.  Even if they don&rsquo;t listen you will have tried.</p>

			<p>Multiculturalism has killed free speech in Europe and Canada.  With the Hate Crimes bill likely to be enacted under our Democratic overlords, multiculturalism will kill free speech here too.  Watch the ACLU only protect pornographers.</p>

<p>Because if they do not continue, the muslims will be outraged, and we all know what happens when muslims are outraged. SKIP the psychic predicted&hellip;.Mr. Wilders will eventually be handed over to the Jordanian authorities for serious prosecution and probable beheading.</p>

			<p>Well, there it is, in black and white: the court has decided that Wilders should stand trail - for his speech.   Just as Bardot did in France.  </p>
<p>As Obama and his ilk (those who hate whites; ie: nearly all non-whites, and liberals) remake America at breakneck speed, how long will it be before it is illegal here also to even say that you don&rsquo;t like the idea?   To a certain degree, it already is, and things are heating up quickly. </p>
<p>The only stage remaining will be to prosecute &amp; persecute those who LOOK like they have unacceptable thoughts, such as those who wear hoop skirts, Confederate symbols, have pro-constitution bumper stickers on their cars, those who insist on driving American cars (big brother&rsquo;s getting rid of those, anyway); and eventually, anybody who is white.  </p>

			<p>It will be dropped and some token fine levied.  The political elites know very well instead of marginalizing Wilder this conviction will assure he will be the next Prime Minister.  Dutch people know their country is doomed to the muslim hoards and have had enough.  The gloom is incredible.  All this happened really in the last 10 years.</p>

			<p>Sorry, to disagree with many, but I don&rsquo;t have much sympathy for this man. I am suspicious of him and of his backers.  His total and limited obsession seems to be with Islam, nothing else.  As far as I can determine, he has no concern about race whatsoever. Immigrants can pour into the Netherlands from every point on the globe   &mdash;   and that&rsquo;s fine, just so long as they aren&rsquo;t Moslems.  Thus, his case is a distraction from the real  and basic issue, which is racial not religious. <br>
Not that I&rsquo;m saying that Islam isn&rsquo;t part of the problem; but it isn&rsquo;t THE problem.  Race, diversity, and immigration are at the heart of the problem.  He doesn&rsquo;t care about them.</p>

			<p>To ghw:</p>
<p>No, in Europe (and elsewhere) Islam is very much THE problem. The overwhelming bulk of immigration into Europe is Muslim, with other religious and racial groups deliberately thrown in to disguise the predominantly Islamic nature of this socially-engineered demographic shift.</p>
<p>By all means let us halt and reverse all Third-World immigration into First-World nations, but we Europeans are right to focus upon Islam as the principal threat to our nations and civilisation.</p>
<p>(To understand exactly why this is happening in Europe, read Fjordman&rsquo;s blogs on the Gates of Vienna web site, especially his &#8220;Defeating Eurabia&#8221; series, which has also been published in book form.)</p>

<p>ghw makes the mistake of insisting that everyone on our side must be 100% honest and speak, think, act for RACE, RACE, RACE.</p>
<p>This strategy doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Geert Wilders is smart and is pursing a strategy that works - he finds an enemy that White Western people - the Dutch can rally together to fight, resist. In this case it is ugly, racially and culturally alien Islam.</p>
<p>Islamic immigrant/invaders are a great enemy - the public understands that they are very different. There are few if any problems with White liberals/leftists taking the Muslim extremist side.</p>
<p>Virtually all Whites from Left to Right, secular, Christian, straight, gay fear and hate Muslim terrorists, Muslim immigrant invaders.</p>
<p>Do you like Al Qaeda terrorists like the ones that did 9/11?</p>
<p>Would you get on an airplane with Muslims that looked like them?</p>
<p>Would you try to strike up a conversation about free market economics or the need to re-order the world along racial lines?</p>
<p>Come on. </p>
<p>Stop being a contrarian.</p>
<p>Geert Wilders and his program work, they are successful - they are competing for the most popular party in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Go with what works.</p>

<p>I am not surprised&hellip;this persecution of people who oppose the extreme leftist multicultural Marxist agenda has been going on in the Netherlands for as long as I can remember. Pim Fortuyn &amp; Theo van Gogh got killed, they ridiculed Philomena Bijlhout &amp; Rita Verdonk into silence&hellip;and now we have Geert Wilders his life hanging in the balance. Year after year the State Department comes out with whitewashed country reports making this abuse of power by the Dutch government seem legitimate and acceptable. Muslims can do what they want, even the Queen came out offering up the country to the Muslims, the rest just have to bite the dust and accept whatever is forced down their throat by the cowards in high places who killed God&hellip;.but fear allah.</p>
<p>The only person who publicly condemned these human right violations on behalf of the United States is George W. Bush. The only mainstream media outlet that makes mention of what is going on in the Netherlands is Fox News. The rest is suspiciously silence about this threat to democracy&hellip;..sic)</p>

<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re encouraged by the posters at Dutch News&rsquo;s site. Seriously, if you haven&rsquo;t done so, read the original article and the comments below it. The level of jackboot mentality, not to mention the vitriol aimed at Wilders personally, is disturbing. It was like reading a transcript of the Two Minutes Hate online.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the thread goes on, you find those who support the prosecution failing to refute anything Wilders has said, opting instead to simply blast him for saying it. When taken to task for this, they get into statments like these:</p>
<p>&#8220;but what he has done, as a sitting member of parliament, has endangered regular dutch citizens all over the world and just added fuel to the hate-bon fire&#8221;</p>
<p>-posted by PatriotinExile</p>
<p>&#8220;Wilders and his cohorts incite the gullible few who in turn provoke Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<p>-posted by obi</p>
<p>&#8220;Wilders is responsible for the damages done to the Dutch interests overseas. The lives of the dutch diplomats and citizen are in danger in Afghanistan, Pakistan and most of the muslim countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>-posted by Jerry</p>
<p>As with everything I have read on this particular topic, the principal motivator seems to be fear of the muslims.</p>

Those comments at the site are indeed disturbing. While I remain somewhat leery of this man&rsquo;s motives and backers (they smell neocon-ish to me), I absolutely support his right to speak freely.  Some of those readers&rsquo; comments, even most of them, were appalling in their utter disregard for our basic Western values.  From the unreasoned, fanatical tone, I suspect they were mostly written by foreigners/Moslems, not Dutchmen. </p>
<p>On the other hand, there were a few rational and enlightened comments too, which were more encouraging. But what&rsquo;s less encouraging is that they seem to have been written by Americans and Englishmen, not Dutchmen!  Where are the Dutch commenters?  Cowering in fear?   This is the brave little country that in the days of Erasmus, Spinoza, Descartes was once a bastion of liberty?  The country that fought off powerful invaders time and again, only to go under now without a whimper? It does not bode very well for Holland when the people willing to defend liberty are mostly abroad. Or seem to be!  </p>

<p>The problem, jack ellis, that ghw is trying to elaborate can be put simply:  of the nations with the highest birthrates, almost all are in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Not North Africa (Maghreb), but South, as in Bantus.  This Muslim Arab obsession merely reflects the obsessions of our Media-masters and carefully neglects the overwhelming tide of non-Muslim, non-White immigration (from Africa, Asia and otherwise) to come.  And furthermore, if they play by the rules and are less obnoxious than Muslims, how will Whites from Left to Right justify their opposition to their migration here?  </p>
