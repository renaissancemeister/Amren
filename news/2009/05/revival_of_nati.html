<h1>Revival of National Black Power Conference Starts Today in Marietta</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marcus E. Howard, Marietta (Georgia) Daily, May 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The three-day National Black Power conference will be conducted in Marietta beginning today at the Crown Plaza Hotel at 1775 Parkway Place near the intersection of Interstate 75 and S. Marietta Parkway.</p>
<p>It is the first time the conference has been convened in 35 years, according to the New Black Panther Party, which is organizing the event. The conference is expected to draw black nationalists and activists from around the country together.</p>
<p>The purpose is to set an agenda to deal with concerns and problems impacting black Americans, such as education and health care, said Minister Hashim Nzinga, the Washington, D.C.-based national chief of staff of the New Black Panther Party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the keynote speakers are Southern Christian Leadership Conference former President Dr. Charles Steele; Dr. Leonard Jeffries Jr. of City College of New York; and attorney Malik Zulu Shabazz, chairman of the New Black Panther Party.</p>
<p>The conference&rsquo;s schedule includes a variety of workshops on such issues as police brutality, hip hop music, gangs and reparations, as well as a tribute to the late Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad.</p>
<p>Marietta was largely chosen as the conference site because the Crown Plaza Hotel is black-owned by businessman Mike Roberts, said Nzinga.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&rsquo;t want to do a black power conference at a white-owned hotel,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the conference&rsquo;s sponsors such as the New Black Panther Party and Black Lawyers for Justice, as well as some of the speakers, are controversial and have even been labeled by critics as hate groups, Nzinga said the event is meant to unify different organizations to create an agenda for action.</p>
<p>He said the election of the nation&rsquo;s first black president presented the perfect time to revive the event. {snip}</p>

			<p>I fail to see how the election of a black President meant that it was the perfect time to revive the event.  It should mean that such events are superfluous and unnecessary.</p>

<p>Hashim Nzinga?  Sounds like he would fit in better in Africa.  Too bad he doesn&rsquo;t take his motley crew of miscreants and hold his big, important meeting in Zimbabwe where he can show everybody how successful blacks can be on their own.</p>

<p>Sounds pretty racist, but this might actually be a good idea.  When the attendees of the &#8220;conference&#8221; trash the hotel they will have no one but themselves to blame.  But, now that I think about it, even if the bruthas lay waste to the hotel they are in, somehow it will still be the White man&rsquo;s fault.</p>

			<p>I wonder if they will also discuss the rising AIDS epidemic in the black commuinty, the out of wedlock births, the high school drop out rate, the black on black crime and all the missing black fathers in their childrens lives? OH!!WAIT!! NO, they can&rsquo;t blame these things on WHITE people, so scratch them. Come on, this is a JOKE right? They have only themselves to blame for the state of their commuinty and they know it. </p>

			<p>The more power blacks get the more racist they become.  Since they&rsquo;re gaining from their bigotry they tend to become more extreme.  The original Black Panthers were a violent street gang. They are now portrayed as heroes.  We should have a conference to discuss issues affecting us.</p>

			<p>Decades from now, if I am still alive, they will be talking about how 2008-2012 was the high water mark of Black Power&hellip; before they were completely and permanently ecllipsed by the Mexican demographic. </p>
<p>The irony of course, will be that a semi-Black president will be the agent that will consign the Nego to third-rate status in this country by pushing for amnesty for illegal aliens&hellip;..a cycle that will repeat itself every twenty years and becoming five times larger each time. </p>
<p>In 1987, Ronald Reagan granted amnesty to 4 million illegals. Now Mr. Obama wants to extend amnesty to another 20 million illegals. Twenty years from now (or less), they will be wanting to grant amnesty to 100 million illegal aliens. How many is enough?<br>

			<p>To &#8220;Ranger&#8221; on May 22nd: Zimbabwe is just one example of Black-run Government. There is also the current South Africa, that went from First World, White Western status, to Third World status, since the end of the Apartheid Government. Of all the Coutries in Africa, South Africa has the worst crime rate, compliments from the ANC Government. </p>
<p>Now, look a little closer to home. Haiti, which has been independent from France since 1804, is a giant Garbage Dump, in the middle of the Carribbean. Do we really expect better from any of these people, anywhere else? </p>
<p>I am interested to know what the Media would say, if there was a &#8220;White Nationalist&#8221; Gathering of groups such as the League of the South, Council of Conservative Citizens, the American Nationalist Union, VDARE, with such speakers as David Duke. </p>
<p>I am sure such a &#8220;White Power&#8221; and &#8220;White Nationalist&#8221; gathering would be protested by throngs of all the Usual Suspects, from Communists and Socialists, to Anarchists, Mecha, Aztlan, the Brown Berets, and all the other groups of the Queer Rainbow.</p>
<p>At least they are in a Black-owned Hotel. Like a Poster said before, when they trash it, and they will, the Owners will know who is at fault. Their own &#8220;Peeps&#8221;. <br>

<p>I love this idea. I hope it catches on like a prairie fire through a wheat field in Kansas.</p>
<p>And while you are at it, quit going to white dentists and doctors. Always insist on a black doctor. And definitely do not take any medicine invented by whitey, or drink any of his water, or eat any of his food.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t read any books written by whitey or watch any television programs that include whites. Don&rsquo;t rent any house that belongs to a white landlord or buy a car from a car dealer that is white.</p>
<p>I love this idea. Spread it around.</p>

			<p>As someone who grew up in Berkeley and Oakland, I don&rsquo;t laugh at the idea of black power. That&rsquo;s a luxury you have in other places. </p>
<p>They can hit you and you can not retaliate. They will corner, chase, and assault you and your women. They are race-aware, connected, and protected.  </p>
<p>There are limits to their power. There are places where they are powerless. But the truth is there are places where they are more powerful than you, as a white man, and they exercise that power where they can. </p>
<p>You can mock them, sympathize with them, ignore them, socialize with them, or even hate them. Do not, however, underestimate these people. </p>
<p>Pay attention. </p>

<p>EXACTLY RIGHT&hellip;hope for the best but plan for the worst. The same goes for the muslims. Both classes are protected by the U.S. government and any heresy by WHITES will not be tolerated.</p>

			<p>One of their topics will be education. I hope that they can come to a conclusion about blacks being in the same schools, sitting next to whites, same books, same learning tools, same teachers, but still functioning below grade level. Can&rsquo;t wait to hear how whites managed this.</p>

			<p>What irritates me is when there is a black that hates white people, the whites always sheepishly and cowardly say, &#8220;Oh, I never owned a slave&#8221; or &#8220;oh! I&rsquo;m not racist&#8221; instead of being defensive and shouting down these black bigots and scolding them harshly.  I don&rsquo;t care why you hate someone or why you hate me.  If you are trying to threaten me or my loved ones, I will do anything necessary to stop you and I don&rsquo;t care why you are going to harm me or my family. </p>

 That&rsquo;s always irritated me too. And also when blacks call someone &#8216;racissss&rsquo; and the Whites say- -&#8220;some of my best friends are black,I have black neighbors, and when they moved in I brought them cookies&#8221; or some nonsense like that. Whenever one of those idiots call me &#8216;racissss&rsquo; I tell them &#8220;not that I care what you think of me, but you&rsquo;re entitled to your opinion.&#8221; Another one I use is- -&#8220;is this the part where I&rsquo;m suppose to shut up and bow down and kiss your feet because you called me a racist?  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m glad I don&rsquo;t work at that hotel.  Can you imagine the behavior, the demands, the vulgarity.</p>
<p>Owner is lucky he is black.  If they had this conference in a White owned hotel discrimination lawsuits would be filed within 48 hours. He really should get payment in advance.  If he doesn&rsquo;t, they won&rsquo;t pay him.  If he presses for payment his house might burn down and strangers might pick up his kids or grandchildren at school.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t these the people who still claim the Duke Lacrosse team is guilty?</p>

			<p>The website announcing the conference is here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blackpowermovement.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackpowermovement.org/</a></p>
<p>But turn down the volume before you visit it or you&rsquo;ll get blasted out of your seat.  The speakers are the usual bunch of racist black crazies, far more extreme in their views than anybody who ever spoke at an American Renaissance conference.  But we know the usual nose ring and green hair crowd isn&rsquo;t going to protest the meeting.</p>

			<p>This group mentality is no different than ours (tribal), I embrace their voluntary withdrawal from our society. The beauty is the more empowered they get the more ugly they will get. Whites, Americans, and good black people etc etc need all the wake up calls!!!! we they can get.</p>

This event only serves our purpose.<br>

<p>What I have said is &#8220;oh, so you call me a racist instead of telling me what&rsquo;s wrong with my views?&#8221; or if I&rsquo;m in a good mood I&rsquo;ll just chuckle and say, &#8220;You know, you can call me a racist until you&rsquo;re blue in the face.

<p>What makes me laugh at &#8220;black power&#8221; is how idiotic and childish and paranoid these black militants think.  Also, I laugh because here they are in a majority-white country griping about white people, griping about oppression, griping about how they don&rsquo;t need whites&hellip;.yet they are asking us for donations and they&rsquo;ll sit here and complain instead of moving to a place where this is no white people. I also think it&rsquo;s funny that they complain the white man is &#8220;weak&#8221;, yet we&rsquo;re holding them down.  <i>I also think</i> it&rsquo;s hysterical to watch them get pushed around by hispanics while trying to get them to form a black-brown union.</p>

			<p>If anything, the election of a Black president is reason to hold a White Power conference.  The New Black Panthers want to take the race game back 35 years and I think that&rsquo;s fine if Whites do the same.  Where&rsquo;s George Wallace when we need him?  Not the sell-out Wallace of the 1980s, but the &#8220;stand up for America&#8221; Wallace of the 1960s.  </p>

			<p>When a Colored calls me a &#8220;Racist&#8221;, I reply with, &#8220;You&rsquo;re just picking up on that?&#8221;. Hell yes, I am Racist, and so are they. But, for some reason, Coloreds being Racist is OK, where it is a sin for Whites to want to defend themselves, their families, their property, and their jobs, or Businesses, from Minorities. </p>
<p>I am sick of the Double Standards in this Country.</p>
