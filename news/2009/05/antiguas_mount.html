<h1>Antigua&rsquo;s &#8216;Mount Obama&rsquo; to Be National Park</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AK-BF/ML, May 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Antigua plans to do more than just rename its highest peak to honor President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Baldwin Spencer says his government wants to create Mount Obama Monument and National Park with a new network of hiking trails. He also plans a museum with entertainment and educational facilities.</p>
<p>Spencer says Mount Obama will be a &#8220;beacon of hope for all people.&#8221;</p>
<p>He outlined his plan to reporters Monday. He did not say how much it would cost or how the government of the dual-island nation of Antigua and Barbuda would pay for it.</p>
<p>The 1,319-foot (402-meter) mountain is currently known as Boggy Peak. It will be renamed on Aug. 4  &mdash;  Obama&rsquo;s birthday. Spencer says the U.S. president will be invited to the ceremony.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m from the western US.  1300 feet is a hill, not a &#8220;mountain.&#8221;  Spencer is seriously deluded.  He should get out more, maybe leave his little island to see what the rest of us call a mountain.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s right Antigua! You show this evil, corrupt country we call the United States of America that we can do so much better! </p>
<p>A &ldquo;beacon of hope for all people,&#8221; indeed! But what is the hope? That this earth can someday be free of evil, vile white racism, of course! And how will we show it? By stepping aside as a race and allowing nonwhites to take the reigns of power in all important offices!</p>
<p>The USA used to be the &#8220;beacon of hope&#8221; for the entire world, but not anymore! That was before the fundamental racist corruption of the USA was exposed by the leftists for all to see! </p>
<p>God bless Antigua! God save the USA!</p>

<p>Is that really the highest point in this pest hole?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Island nation&rsquo;s highest peak to become &ldquo;beacon of hope for all people.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t they wait to see if he can stay out of jail first?</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s barely into his presidency and if just one or two oddball items he is demanding go up in smoke he could well implode badly.</p>
<p>And what happens, if like Lincoln, he&rsquo;s a civil war president, but one who is on the losing side?</p>
<p>Winners in civil conflicts have a nasty habit of persecuting their opponents.</p>

			<p>Does anyone else note the increasing use of all this vague but suggestive terminology, making sly hints but not promising anything specific.  A beacon of hope.  Change you can belive in.</p>
<p>What is all this &#8220;hope&#8221;  and  &#8220;change&#8221; supposed to be about, anyway? Whose hope?  What kind of change? The politicians are babbling without saying anything,  toying with the public. Someone needs to pin them down on these things. </p>

			<p>Well said, Anonymous. 400 meters? I have seen vertical faces three times that, and a reasonable understanding what a &#8220;mountain&#8221; is.<br>
However, as a monument to Hussein, I find it apt (we´re not talking ´bout Mount Rushmore, are we).<br>
&#8220;Boggy Peak&#8221;? I love it :)</p>

			<p>Here in Germany, after Hitler came to power in 1933, many German cities and villages renamed their main street &#8220;Adolf-Hitler-Strasse&#8221;. But the Hitler cult never reached such extremes that a Mountain or hill was named after him. Have the peoples of the Americas gone mad?</p>

Remember when Obama did the town hall meeting and a black women and an hispanic man both praised Obama and asked for help?</p>
<p>We have communities in the US renaming schools in honor of Obama.</p>
<p>While I know Antigua is a foreign nation, this praise and pandering to the &#8216;Big Black Chief&rsquo; resembles the workings of a nation in Africa more each day.</p>

And let&rsquo;s also note that Antigua isn&rsquo;t even of of the US states, nor is Obama their president.   Yet it&rsquo;s obvious that he&rsquo;s the  universal hero of all blacks everywhere.  So what is it all about?  Simple: It&rsquo;s Race.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re the ones who&rsquo;re called racists!</p>
