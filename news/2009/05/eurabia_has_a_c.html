<h1><a href="https://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1338480?eng=y">Eurabia Has a Capital: Rotterdam</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sandro Magister, Chiesa News (Italy), May 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of the most indisputable results of Benedict XVI&rsquo;s trip to the Holy Land was the improvement in relations with Islam. The three days he spent in Jordan, and then, in Jerusalem, the visit to the Dome of the Mosque, spread an image among the Muslim general public  &mdash;  to an extent never before seen  &mdash;  of a pope as a friend, surrounded by Islamic leaders happy to welcome him and work together with him for the good of the human family.</p>
<p>But just as indisputable is the distance between this image and the harsh reality of the facts. Not only in countries under Muslim regimes, but also where the followers of Mohammed are in the minority, for example in Europe.</p>
<p>In 2002, the scholar Bat Ye&rsquo;or, a British citizen born in Egypt and a specialist in the history of the Christian and Jewish minorities in Muslim countries  &mdash;  called the &#8220;dhimmi&#8221;  &mdash;  coined the term &#8220;Eurabia&#8221; to describe the fate toward which Europe is moving. It is a fate of submission to Islam, of &#8220;dhimmitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oriana Fallaci used the word &#8220;Eurabia&#8221; in her writings, and gave it worldwide resonance. On August 1, 2005, Benedict XVI received Fallaci in a private audience at Castel Gandolfo. She rejected dialogue with Islam; he was in favor of it, and still is. But they agreed  &mdash;  as Fallaci later said  &mdash;  in identifying the &#8220;self-hatred&#8221; that Europe demonstrates, its spiritual vacuum, its loss of identity, precisely when the immigrants of Islamic faith are increasing within it.</p>
<p>Holland is an extraordinary test case. It is the country in which individual license is the most extensive  &mdash;  to the point of permitting euthanasia on children  &mdash;  in which the Christian identity is most faded, in which the Moslem presence is growing most boldly.</p>
<p>Here, multiculturalism is the rule. But the exceptions are dramatic: from the killing of the anti-Islamist political leader Pim Fortuyn to the persecution of the Somali dissident Ayaan Hirsi Ali to the murder of the director Theo Van Gogh, condemned to death for his film &#8220;Submission,&#8221; a denunciation of the crimes of Muslim theocracy. Fortuyn&rsquo;s successor, Geert Wilders, has lived under 24-hour police protection for six years.</p>
<p>There is one city in Holland where this new reality can be seen with the naked eye, more than anywhere else. Here, entire neighborhoods look as if they have been lifted from the Middle East, here stand the largest mosques in Europe, here parts of sharia law are applied in the courts and theaters, here many of the women go around veiled, here the mayor is a Muslim, the son of an imam.</p>
<p>This city is Rotterdam, Holland&rsquo;s second largest city by population, and the largest port in Europe by cargo volume.</p>
<p>The following is a report on Rotterdam published in the Italian newspaper &#8220;il Foglio&#8221; on May 14, 2009, the second in a major seven-part survey on Holland.</p>
<p>The author, Giulio Meotti, also writes for the &#8220;Wall Street Journal.&#8221; Next September, his book-length survey on Israel will be published.</p>
<p><b>In the casbah of Rotterdam</b></p>
<p>by Giulio Meotti</p>
<p>In Feyenoord, veiled women can be seen everywhere, darting like a flash through the streets of the neighborhood. They avoid any sort of contact,  even eye contact, especially with men. Feyenoord is the size of a city, and there are seventy nationalities coexisting there. It is an area that lives on subsidies and residential construction, and it is here that it is most obvious that Holland  &mdash;  with all of its rules against discrimination and all of its moral indignation  &mdash;  is a completely segregated society. Rotterdam is new, having been bombed twice by the Luftwaffe during the second world war. Like Amsterdam, it is below sea level, but unlike the capital it does not enjoy an image of reckless abandon. In Rotterdam, it is the Arab shops selling halal food that dominate the cityscape, not the neon lights of the prostitutes. Everywhere are casbah-cafes, travel agencies offering flights to Rabat and Casablanca, posters expressing solidarity with Hamas, or offering affordable Dutch language lessons.</p>
<p>It is the second-largest city in the country, a poor city, but also the economic engine with its huge port, the most important in Europe. Most of the population are immigrants, and the city has the tallest and most imposing mosque in Europe. Sixty percent of the foreigners who arrive in Holland come here to live. The most striking thing when one arrives in the city by train are the enormous and fascinating mosques framed by the vibrant green, luxuriant, wooded, watery countryside, like an alien presence compared to the rest. They call it &#8220;Eurabia.&#8221; The Turkish Mevlana mosque is imposing. It has the tallest minarets in Europe, even higher than the stadium of the Feyenoord soccer team.</p>
<p>Many of the neighborhoods in Rotterdam are captive to the darkest, most violent form of Islamism. Pim Fortuyn&rsquo;s house stands out like a pearl in a sea of chador and niqab. It is at number 11 Burgerplein, behind the train station. Every now and then someone comes to put flowers in front of the home of the professor who was murdered in Amsterdam on May 6, 2002. Someone else leaves a card: &#8220;In Holland everything is tolerated, except for the truth.&#8221; A millionaire named Chris Tummesen bought Pim Fortuyn&rsquo;s house so that it would remain intact. The evening before his murder Pim was nervous,  and had said on television that a climate of demonization had been created against him and his ideas. And his fears came true, when he was shot in the head five times by Volkert van der Graaf, a militant of the animal rights left, scrawny, head shaved, eyes dark, dressed like an environmental purist in a handmade shirt, sandals, and goat&rsquo;s wool socks, a strict vegetarian, &#8220;a guy impatient to change the world,&#8221; his friends say.</p>
<p>Not long ago in downtown Rotterdam, funerary photos of Geert Wilders were placed under a tree, with a candle to commemorate his upcoming death. Today Wilders is the most popular politician in the city. He is the heir of Fortuyn, the homosexual, Catholic, ex-Markist professor who had formed his own party to save the country from Islamization. At his funeral, only the absence of Queen Beatrice kept the farewell to the &#8220;divine Pim&#8221; from becoming a funeral fit for a king. Before his death they made a monster of him (one Dutch minister called him an &#8220;untermensch,&#8221; an inferior man in Nazi parlance), afterward they idolized him. The prostitutes of Amsterdam left a wreath of flowers in his honor beneath the National Monument in Dam Square, a memorial to the victims of World War II.</p>
<p>Three months ago, &#8220;The Economist,&#8221; a weekly publication far from Wilders&rsquo; anti-Islamic ideas, spoke of Rotterdam as a &#8220;Eurabian nightmare.&#8221; For most of the Dutch who live there, Islamism is now a threat greater than the Delta Plan, the complicated system of dikes that prevents flooding from the sea, like the flood in 1953 that killed two thousand people. The picturesque town of Schiedam, part of the greater Rotterdam area, has always been a jewel in the Dutch imagination. Then the fairy tale glow faded, when in the newspapers three years ago it became the city of Farid A., the Islamist who made death threats against Wilders and Somali dissident Ayaan Hirsi Ali. For six years, Wilders has lived under 24-hour police protection.</p>
<p>Muslim lawyers in Rotterdam also want to change the rules of the courtroom, asking to be allowed to remain seated when the judge enters. They recognize Allah alone. The lawyer Mohammed Enait recently refused to stand when the magistrates enter the courtroom, saying that &#8220;Islam teaches that all men are equal.&#8221; The court of Rotterdam has recognized Enait&rsquo;s right to remain seated: &#8220;There is no legal obligation requiring Muslim lawyers to stand in front of the court, insofar as this action is in contrast with the dictates of the Islamic faith.&#8221; Enait, the head of the legal office Jairam Advocaten, has explained that &#8220;he considers all men equal, and does not acknowledge any form of deference toward anyone.&#8221; All men, but not all women. Enait is well known for his refusal to shake hands with women, and has repeatedly said he would prefer them to wear the burqa. And there are many burqas on the streets of Rotterdam.</p>
<p>The fact that Eurabia has arrived in Rotterdam has been demonstrated by an episode in April at the Zuidplein Theatre, one of the most prestigious in the city, a modernist theater proud of &#8220;representing the cultural diversity of Rotterdam.&#8221; It is located in the southern part of the city, and receives funding from the municipality, headed by a Muslim, the son of the imam Ahmed Aboutaleb. Three weeks ago, the Zuidplein Theatre allowed an entire balcony to be reserved for women only, in the name of sharia. This is not happening in Pakistan or in Saudi Arabia, but in the city from which the Founding Fathers set out for the United States. It was from here that the Puritans disembarked in the Speedwell, which they later exchanged for the Mayflower. This is where the American adventure began. Today, it has legalized sharia.</p>
<p>For a performance by the Muslim Salaheddine Benchikhi, the Zuidplein Theatre agreed to his request to have the first five rows set aside for women only. Salaheddine, an editorialist for the website Morokko.nl, is known for his opposition to the integration of Muslims. The city council has approved this: &#8220;According to our Western values, the freedom to live one&rsquo;s own life by virtue of one&rsquo;s convictions is a precious possession.&#8221; A spokesman for the theater has also defended the director: &#8220;It is hard to get Muslims to come to the theater, so we are willing to adapt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another man who has been willing to adapt is the director Gerrit Timmers. His words are fairly symptomatic of what Wilders calls &#8220;self-Islamization.&#8221; The first case of self-censorship took place in Rotterdam, in December of 2000. Timmers, the director of the theater group Onafhankelijk Toneel, wanted to stage a performance about the life of Mohammed&rsquo;s wife Aisha. The play was boycotted by the Muslim actors in the company when it became evident that it would be a target for the Islamists. &#8220;We are enthusiastic about the play, but fear reigns,&#8221; the actors told him. The composer, Najib Cherradi, said that he would withdraw &#8220;for the good of my daughter.&#8221; The newspaper &#8220;Handelsblad&#8221; gave the story the title &#8220;Tehran on the Meuse,&#8221; the name of the gentle river that passes through Rotterdam. &#8220;I had already done three works about the Moroccans, so I wanted to have Muslim actors and singers,&#8221; Timmers tells us. &#8220;Then they told me that it was a dangerous issue, and they could not participate, because they had received death threats. In Rabat, an article came out saying we would end up like Salman Rushdie. For me, it was more important to continue the dialogue with the Moroccans, rather than provoke them. For this reason, I see no problem if the Muslims want to separate the men from the women in a theater.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s meet the director who has brought sharia to the Dutch theaters, Salaheddine Benchikhi. He is young, modern, confident, and speaks perfect English. &#8220;I defend the decision to separate the men from the women, because here there is freedom of expression and organization. If people can&rsquo;t sit where they want to, that is discrimination. There are two million Muslims in Holland, and they want our tradition to become public, everything is evolving. Mayor Aboutaleb has supported me.&#8221;</p>
<p>One year ago, the city was buzzing when the newspapers published a letter by Bouchra Ismaili, a Rotterdam city councilman: &#8220;Listen up, crazy freaks, we&rsquo;re here to stay. You&rsquo;re the foreigners here, with Allah on my side I&rsquo;m not afraid of anything. Take my advice: convert to Islam, and you will find peace.&#8221; Just a walk through the streets of the city, and you know right away that in many neighborhoods you are no longer in Holland. It is right out of the Middle East. In some schools, there is a &#8220;room of silence&#8221; where Muslim students, who are in the majority, can pray five times a day, with a poster of Mecca, the Qur&rsquo;an, and a ritual washing before the prayers. Another Muslim city councilman, Brahim Bourzik, wants signs placed in various parts of the city showing the direction to Mecca.</p>
<p>Sylvain Ephimenco is a Franco-Dutch journalist who has been living in Rotterdam for twelve years. For twenty years, he was the &#8220;Libération&#8221; correspondent in Holland, and is proud of his leftist credentials. &#8220;Even though I don&rsquo;t believe in that anymore,&#8221; he says, welcoming us to his home overlooking one of Rotterdam&rsquo;s little canals. Not far from here is the al Nasr mosque of the imam Khalil al Moumni, who when gay marriage was legalized described homosexuals as &#8220;sick people worse than pigs.&#8221; From the outside, it can be seen that the mosque is more than twenty years old, having been built by the first Moroccan immigrants. Moumni has written a pamphlet that is circulating around the Dutch mosques, &#8220;The path of the Muslim,&#8221; in which he explains that the heads of homosexuals should be cut off and &#8220;hung from the highest building in the city.&#8221; Next to the al Nasr mosque, we sit down at a cafe for men only. In front of us is a halal Islamic slaughterhouse. Ephimenco is the author of three essays on Holland and Islam, and today is a famous columnist for the leftist Christian newspaper &#8220;Trouw.&#8221; He has the best perspective for understanding a city that, perhaps even more than Amsterdam, embodies the tragedy of Holland.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not at all true that Wilders gets his votes from the fringes, everyone knows that, even though they don&rsquo;t say it,&#8221; he tells us. &#8220;Today educated people vote for Wilders, although at first it was the lower class Dutch, the tattoo crowd. Many academics and people on the left vote for him. The problem is all of these Islamic headscarves. There&rsquo;s a supermarket behind my house. When I arrived, there wasn&rsquo;t a single headscarf. Now it&rsquo;s all Muslim women with the chador at the register. Wilders is not Haider. His positions are on the right, but also on the left, he&rsquo;s a typical Dutchman. Here there are even hours at the swimming pool set aside for Muslim women. This is the origin of the vote for Wilders. Islamization, this foolishness with the theater, has to be stopped. In Utrecht, there is a mosque where they provide separate city services for men and women. The Dutch are afraid. Wilders is against the Frankenstein of multiculturalism. I, who used to be on the left but am no longer anything, I say we&rsquo;ve reached the limit. I feel the ideals of the Enlightenment have been betrayed with this voluntary apartheid, in my heart I feel the death of the ideals of the equality of men and women, and freedom of expression. Here the left is conformist, and the right has the better answer to insane multiculturalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the professors at Erasmus University in Rotterdam is Tariq Ramadan, the famous Swiss Islamic scholar who is also a special adviser for the city. Some of Ramadan&rsquo;s statements against homosexuality were uncovered by Holland&rsquo;s most famous gay magazine, &#8220;Gay Krant,&#8221; directed by a talkative journalist named Henk Krol. On a videocassette, Ramadan calls homosexuality &#8220;a disease, a disorder, an imbalance.&#8221; On the tape, Ramadan also has comments on women, &#8220;they should keep their eyes on the ground when they&rsquo;re on the street.&#8221; Wilders&rsquo; party asked for the city council to be disbanded, and for the Islamic scholar from Geneva to be sent packing, but instead he was renewed in his post for two more years. This was happening while across the sea, the Obama administration was confirming the ban on Ramadan entering United States territory. The tapes in Krol&rsquo;s possession include one in which Ramadan tells women: &#8220;Allah has an important rule: if you try to attract attention through the use of perfume, or your appearance or gestures, you do not have the correct spiritual orientation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When Pim Fortuyn was killed, it was a shock for everyone, because a man was murdered for what he said,&#8221; Krol tells us. &#8220;That was no longer my country. I&rsquo;m still thinking about leaving Holland, but where can I go? Here we have been criticized by everyone, by the Catholic Church and by the Protestants. But when we criticized Islam, they answered us: you are creating new enemies!&#8221; According to Ephimenco, the street is the secret of Wilders&rsquo; success: &#8220;In Rotterdam, there are three enormous mosques, one of them is the largest in Europe. There are more and more Islamic headscarves, and an Islamist impulse coming from the mosques. I know many people who have left the city center to go to the rich, white suburbs. My neighborhood is poor and black. It is a question of identity, on the streets Dutch is not spoken anymore, but Arabic and Turkish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s meet the man who inherited Fortuyn&rsquo;s column in the newspaper &#8220;Elsevier.&#8221; His name is Bart Jan Spruyt, a robust young Protestant intellectual, founder of the Edmund Burke Society, but above all the author of Wilders&rsquo; &#8220;Declaration of independence,&#8221; and his coworker from the beginning. &#8220;Here an immigrant no longer has to struggle, study, work, he can live at the expense of the state,&#8221; Spruyt tells us. &#8220;We have ended up creating a parallel society. The Muslims are in the majority in many neighborhoods, and are asking for sharia. This isn&rsquo;t Holland anymore. Our use of freedom has turned back against us, it is a process of self-Islamization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spruyt was one of Fortuyn&rsquo;s close friends. &#8220;Pim said what the people had known for decades.&#8221; He attacked the establishment and the journalists. It was a great relief for the people when he went into politics, they called him the &#8216;white knight&rsquo;. The last time I spoke with him, one week before he was killed, he told me he had a mission. His killing was not the act of a lone madman. In February of 2001, Pim announced that he wanted to change the first article of the Dutch constitution, on discrimination, because in his view it kills freedom of expression, and he was right. The following day in the Dutch churches, which are mostly empty and used for public meetings, the diary of Anne Frank was read as a warning against Fortuyn. Pim was truly Catholic, more than we think, in his books he spoke out against modern society without fathers, without values, empty, nihilist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chris Ripke is a well-known artist in the city. His studio is near a mosque in Insuindestraat. Shocked in 2004 by the murder of director Theo Van Gogh by an Dutch Islamist, Chris decided to paint an angel on wall of his studio and the biblical commandment &#8220;Gij zult niet doden,&#8221; thou shalt not kill. His neighbors at the mosque found the words &#8220;offensive,&#8221; and called the mayor of Rotterdam at the time, the liberal Ivo Opstelten. The mayor ordered the police to erase the painting, because it was &#8220;racist.&#8221; Wim Nottroth, a television journalist, camped out on the spot in protest. The police arrested him, and his film was destroyed. Ephimenco did the same in his own window: &#8220;I put up a big white sheet with the biblical commandment. Photographers came, and the radio. If you can no longer write &#8216;do not kill&rsquo; in this country, then you are saying that we are all in prison. It is like apartheid, whites living with whites and blacks with blacks. There is a great chill. Islamism wants to change the structure of the country.&#8221; For Ephimenco, part of the problem is the de-Christianization of society. &#8220;When I arrived here, during the 1960&rsquo;s, religion was dying, a unique event in Europe, a collective de-Christianization. Then the Muslims brought religion back to the center of social life. Aided by the anti-Christian elite.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go for a stroll through the Islamized neighborhoods. In Oude Westen there are only Arabs, women clothed from head to foot, ethnic foods shops, Islamic restaurants, and shopping centers with Arabic music. &#8220;Ten years ago, you didn&rsquo;t see all these headscarves,&#8221; Ephimenco says. Behind his house, in a flourishing middle class area with two-story houses, there is an Islamized neighborhood. There are Muslim signs everywhere. &#8220;Look at all of those Turkish flags, over there is an important church, but it&rsquo;s empty, no one goes there anymore.&#8221; In the middle of one square stands a mosque with Arabic writing outside. &#8220;That used to be a church.&#8221; Not far from here is the most beautiful monument in Rotterdam. It is a small granite statue of Pim Fortuyn. Beneath the gleaming bronze head, the mouth saying his last words on behalf of freedom of speech, there is written in Latin: &#8220;Loquendi libertatem custodiamus,&#8221; let us safeguard the right to speak. Every day, someone places flowers there.<br>

			<p>Rotterdam is the harbinger of the future of many European and North American cities. Whites have been trained to accommodate, tolerate, and respect, but based on my experience, whenever non-whites (and Muslims) become a majority, they do the exact opposite of what whites do. Non-whites, and Muslims, have a much greater sense of their racial and/or religious identity than whites, and unless we realize this, our days are sorely numbered. Not only in Rotterdam, but globally.</p>

These stories are sobering testaments to what&rsquo;s going on. They&rsquo;re both straightforward and troubling.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Why and how did all this happen to the Netherlands?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>My best guess would be that these guys are smart enough to see that liberalism can be use to their advantage.</p>
<p>These people are unlikely to move to conservative areas in the US or more conservative nations. All they have to do is find the most liberal community and they know the liberals will support them unconditionally. The liberals also know that by supporting muslims &#8216;right&rsquo; to live anywhere, it ticks off evil, racist, bigoted, hateful white conservatives.<br>

			<p>&#8221; here the mayor is a Muslim, the son of an imam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here it should be noted that in the Netherlands the Mayors are not elected by the people of the city but appointed by the Queen or King after being selected by the cabinet.<br>

			<p>how did it happen?  foolish multi-culti liberals thought these creatures would add to what was already an established, refined culture.  </p>
<p>welcome back to the 7th century.</p>

<p>Liberals took over and turned everything into free-love. Then strangely enough, love got more expensive with prostitution and then homo activists on every block, then mary jane coffee houses and drug addicts on the streets. By the way, what does a colonial empire have to do with it? A colony is an outward moving of people. </p>

If they don&rsquo;t do something soon about their own immigration catastrophe, then parts of Italy will resemble Rotterdam in the near future.</p>

<p>Go immediately to www.brusselsjournal.com - It will open your eyes.  There is quite a bit of information about the history of this issue in Europe.  It started with a treaty signed in the early 60s called the Europe Arab Cultural Agreement, or something like that.</p>
<p>Americans &#8220;don&rsquo;t get&#8221; a lot of things.  Living in our little Disneyworld fantasy land of the last 50 years or so, oblivious to what&rsquo;s going on in the world.  Well, this isn&rsquo;t happening JUST in Holland.  It&rsquo;s going on EVERYWHERE in Europe.  And it has been for 50 years.  England and France are now just as overrun with Muslims as Holland is.  Islam is now the majority religion in England.  It&rsquo;s going to happen HERE in just a few more decades.  Islam is coming to America, still slowly, because we are still much more religious and free than Europe is.</p>
<p>Radical leftists have forged ties with Islam to undermine and destroy the Judeo Christian, European culture that they both despise.  With it&rsquo;s democracy, and its capitalism and its Bill of Rights and its belief in individual liberty and the value of human life.  In short, the traditional Western World is a  Christian based orientation that is opposite of everything that Marx and Mohammed preached.</p>
<p>What an odd alliance, ey?  But in retrospect, it seems only natural, because the Soviet Union and the Arab world were bedfellows in military arms and nuclear development since the 50s.  And they still are in many ways.</p>
<p>What will happen if and when the West is finally destroyed?  I don&rsquo;t think we know for sure.  But my guess is that Islam and the Marxists will then go after each other with a vengeance to see who gets to rule the world.  I believe both sides are deceiving one another about their own ultimate intentions - merely for the sake of a convenient alliance against the West.</p>
<p>&#8220;The enemy of my enemy is my friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>But not forever necessarily.</p>

<p>WHITE tolerance of things not White, just look around in the U.S. especially the big cities and think of Holland or Dearborne, Michiganistan. In Arab muslim countries one cannot walk 500 meters without being next to ANOTHER mosque, they&rsquo;re a blight on the skyline and civilized society.</p>

			<p>There is no question that much like in the US and the rest of Europe you have people of european extraction who want to destroy the old order at all costs.  They do not care if things turn out the way in which we have read above that the Netherlands are turning out.  Take a look at the democratic socialists in congress, Nany Pelosi and Teddy Kennedy not to mention the rest of the gang.  How about the black caucus and latino caucus not to mention the &#8220;asian pacific islander&#8221; one.  Lets not forgot our out and out completely and utterly  special interest controlled executive branch and supreme kangaroo court. They seek to create a future for us much like the one above.  They put good dog and pony shows on though dont they.  Last but not least remember retired general Norman Schwarzkopf,  remember when he and 20 or so other retired military general filed the brief in the supreme court affirmative action case a few years back. Retired General Schwartzkopf along with Hugh Shelton and Anthony Zinni and 17 or so others stated in their brief that a racially integrated officer corps was needed for national security. Our enemies are endless. How stupid and how foolish for us to allow the communist and corporate/banking trash to take control of our government away from us and then work towards destroying us by using our tax dollars.  I suppose thats the genius of it using our resources to destroy our future.  </p>

			<p>An friend of mine recently mentioned that her drop dead beautiful white, unmarried Christian niece was having a baby with her Somali boy friend. I asked &#8220;is he black?&#8221; &#8220;Of course,&#8221;she answered, &#8221; do you have a problem with that?&#8221;<br>
I don&rsquo;t have too much hope that my grandchildren will live in a white Christian U.S.A.</p>

<p>I lived in The Netherlands for a little while in 1997 with some Dutch friends.  I asked them this very question.  Here is what they told me;  After WW2 there was such a shortage of young men that Morroccans and others had to be brought in to rebuilt via the Marshall Plan.  (Turks were largely used in Germany, for example).  The idea was that they would all go home after the work was done, but the work took so long that these workers ended up having families and lives in The Netherlands as others did elsewhere in Europe.  They could not in good conscienous send them all back by then.  That is one part of how the problem got started.  The other part is the exploitation of Holland&rsquo;s liberal social system.  The Netherlands has long been a trading nation and the largest port in Northern Europe is Amersterdam.  This has always made them wealthy and today The Netherlands is a very rich little country.  I dated a pretty Dutch woman who was  a teacher.  She chirped proudly about how no one goes without money in The Netherlands because of its wealth and social system.  So Morroccans learned how to get a job, carry on obnoxiously until they would be fired and then live well on the generous and permanent government subsidies.  The third leg of the reasons for this is a very palpable guilt complex over their wealth.  Historian Simon Schama wrote a book on that issue called, &#8220;The Embarrassment of Riches.&#8221;  The Netherlands were very mercenary as traders and exploiters for profit.  If you look at some of the policies of the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company you will see that that part of the Dutch character has not changed much.  Indeed, my friends fianlly got a lottery green card and came to Washington State and used their parents money to monopolize their way into a successful business in the sparsely populated region they live in.</p>

The above was the quote that should have preceeded my comment, don&rsquo;t know how it happened, below is my comment again.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;It is not at all true that Wilders gets his votes from the fringes, everyone knows that, even though they don&rsquo;t say it,&rdquo; he tells us. &ldquo;Today educated people vote for Wilders, although at first it was the lower class Dutch, the tattoo crowd.(FROM ARTICLE ABOVE)</p>
<p>Sounds like my crowd. The tatoo crowd. But many of these young angry Whites are mad about immigration and being assaulted by non-Whites. People that are street smart or were raised on the streets are more racially aware than the lilly White gate gaurded crowd.</p>

<p>Americans get it and have lived around other races far longer than europeans. Americans know about the islamification of europe as well as the mexican invasion here but like europeans, have allowed themselves to either be brainwashed by PC or are too afraid to speak out for fear of being labelled racist.</p>

			<p>I asked &ldquo;is he black?&rdquo; &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo;she answered, &rdquo; do you have a problem with that?&rdquo;<br>
Posted by Muggy</p>
<p>And did you tell her that you DID?  I certainly hope so   &mdash;   especially since she ASKED you, so she can&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re intruding where it&rsquo;s none of your business. That was your chance.</p>
<p>Maybe you could have asked her whether her own mother or grandmother would have had a problem with it. Almost all of them would have.</p>
