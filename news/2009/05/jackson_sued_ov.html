<h1><a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2009/0501092jesse1.html">Jackson Sued Over No-Show</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Smoking Gun, May 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Want to book Jesse Jackson for a speech? Make sure you have $75,000 and a private jet available. That&rsquo;s what the reverend charged for a late-2007 speech in Trinidad, but then never showed for the appearance, according to a lawsuit filed yesterday in Chicago. The AEI Speakers Bureau is suing Jackson for $100,000, claiming that his no-show cost the firm a $63,932 commission and left them with a $36,068 bill for a chartered private jet. Jackson&rsquo;s signed agreement with AEI, a copy of which you&rsquo;ll find below, called for him to address a November 2007 political rally for the United National Congress. According to a complaint filed in Cook County Circuit Court, Jackson &#8220;cited a desire to avoid the perception of showing favoritism to a Trinidad and Tobago political party as his reason for not fulfilling his contractual duties.&#8221; It does not appear that Jackson pocketed his $75,000 fee. In addition to Jackson, AEI arranged paid speaking gigs at the gathering for Al Sharpton and Martin Luther King III, both of whom flew commercial to Trinidad. (4 pages)</p>

			<p>&#8220;The reverend charges $75,000 for a speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know this phrase is overused, but so help me, this stuff is &#8220;Twilight Zone&#8221; type reality.</p>

			<p>So if Jackson gets 75K, does that mean the 63K commission is additional to the buyer?  Do groups really pay $138,000 for the privilege of hearing this man&rsquo;s agitation?  Or does some part of the 63K come out of Jesse&rsquo;s end?</p>

			<p>It would seem that the IRS is afraid oj this &#8220;poverty pimp&#8221; due to their lack of enforcement of the tax laws against his &#8220;operation PUSH&#8221; organization.  It is well documented that there are major &#8220;tax issues&#8221;.  jesse gets a &#8220;pass&#8221; from the feds.</p>

			<p>Wow!  I would soooooo love to pay someone to come into my company and accuse me of being a racist!!!  I mean, it&rsquo;s not like a CEO or a businessman has anything important to do, right?  Come on, seriously, when are these CEO&rsquo;s going to grow a spine and ignore these race hustlers?  My dad is a business owner and I asked him what he would do with someone like Jackson.  He said he&rsquo;d say, &#8220;Get the hell off my property before I call the cops.&#8221;</p>

<p>No Einstein, groups really pay $138,000 for the privilege of the press coverage he automatically generates every time he makes a speech.</p>

			<p>Jackson will not go to a town where he has only one engagment on the same day.  His absolute minimum is 2 engagements, preferably 3 or 4 on the same day.</p>
<p>Then he can charge each organiaztion not only for the speaker fee, but for the costs of his private plane, the cost of the presidential suite at the best hotel in town, salries for the entourage and other costs.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a good scam going.  3 organizations pay him not just his speaker fee, but he gets his expenses reimbursed by the 3 organizations.  By the way, he always has the presidential suite even if he breezes into town at 9am and leaves at 3pm.</p>
<p>The sad thing is that it was the Chicago newspapers that created him back in the late 60&rsquo;s.  He is totally a creation of the liberal Whites.</p>
