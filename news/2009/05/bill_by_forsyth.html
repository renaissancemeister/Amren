<h1>Race and the Death Penalty: Bill by Forsyth Legislators Aims at Disparities</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Romoser, Winston-Salem Journal, May 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two Democratic legislators from Winston-Salem are renewing their push for a bill that would allow defendants to challenge the application of the death penalty by citing statistical racial disparities in the overall use of capital punishment.</p>
<p>State Reps. Larry Womble and Earline Parmon argue that their bill is a matter of basic fairness. They say that it will help prevent racial discrimination in death-penalty cases.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill, including the state&rsquo;s prosecutors, say that it elevates what they say are ambiguous statistics over the particular facts of a case. And they worry that it will effectively end  &mdash;  or severely reduce  &mdash;  the use of the death penalty in North Carolina.</p>
<p>The bill, known as the N.C. Racial Justice Act, was approved yesterday by a 6-5 vote in a judiciary committee of the N.C. House. The full House is expected to vote on it today.</p>
<p>The bill would allow judges to overturn a death sentence if a defendant proved, by citing statistics from previous cases, that race played a significant factor in previous applications of the death penalty  &mdash;  either in that particular county, in that particular prosecutorial district or in the state as a whole.</p>
<p>A defendant could use statistics to try to show that race was a factor either in a prosecutor&rsquo;s decision to pursue the death penalty or in a jury&rsquo;s decision to impose it.</p>
<p>A prosecutor would likewise be able to present his own statistical evidence to try to rebut the defendant&rsquo;s argument.</p>
<p>Both sides could also present other types of evidence, including testimony from attorneys, law-enforcement officers or even jurors who might testify as to whether race may have been a factor in past death-penalty decisions.</p>
<p>The push for the Racial Justice Act comes during a period of statewide reconsideration of capital punishment. Executions in North Carolina have been on hold for nearly three years because of various legal challenges. One of those challenges  &mdash;  involving the role of doctors in monitoring lethal injections  &mdash;  was settled this month by the N.C. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Republicans in the judiciary committee criticized the bill. They said that there aren&rsquo;t enough death sentences in individual counties or prosecutorial districts to compile meaningful statistical samples. Last year, just one person in the entire state was added to death row.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The two sides of the debate disagree on whether existing statistics demonstrate racial bias in the application of the death penalty.</p>
<p>For instance, blacks make up 22 percent of North Carolina&rsquo;s population, but they make up 53 percent of the inmates on North Carolina&rsquo;s death row. That statistic implies that blacks are vastly overrepresented on death row.</p>
<p>On the other hand, blacks make up 62 percent of all convicted murderers in the state&rsquo;s prison system, according to statistics from the N.C. Department of Correction. Because the percentage of convicted murderers who are black is higher than the percentage of blacks who got the death penalty, those numbers could imply that blacks are underrepresented on death row.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Keith [Tom Keith, the Forsyth County district attorney] called the bill &#8220;insulting,&#8221; because he said it assumes that prosecutors are pursuing the death penalty for racial reasons.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Opponents of the death penalty have long argued that it is much more likely to be imposed in cases in which the defendant is black or the victim is white.</p>

		<p> Blacks are not overrepresented on Death Row because of racism; they&rsquo;re overrepresented because they commit a hugely disproportionate number of murders in this country for their percentage of the population.</p>
<p> These two legislators, who I would guess are both black (why didn&rsquo;t the reporter tell us that?), are simply trying to muddy the waters in yet another attempt to make the death penalty about everything but its real function: To permanently remove the most heinous and unrepentant murderers from our society.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the subliminal message that everyone is bombarded with constantly.</p>
<p>The dimwits have their dimwittedness as a firewall to protect them from seeing the danger, but the intelligent people know we are in the process of irreversible dysfunctionality as a nation.</p>

		<p>If there are two sides to the disagreement, how come we only ever read about one side at school and in the media?</p>
<p>Obviously what is needed here is an equally well funded and represented organisation to call for a suspension of the death penalty against whites, because whites who are in jail and have committed murder are more likely to receive the death penalty than their colored counterparts. </p>

		<p>Yawwwwwwwwwn, I have come across this story in one form or another for at least twenty five years. In fact, it was once proven that whites were, proportionately speaking, given the death sentence at a higher rate than any minorities. It doesn&rsquo;t surprise me either, because, in my experience, no one gets as judgemental towards whites as other whites. </p>

		<p>The death penalty should be abolished, but not because it is racist. The very chart that people point to to show that the death penalty is racist shows just the opposite: as the number of executions declines for whites, it declines for blacks also, and as the number of executions climbs for blacks, it also climbs for whites. This is the case, even in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, when racism was supposedly rampant. See http://tinyurl.com/p584w6 As long as the death penalty is in place, innocent people will be executed. But the cause is primarily human error - false confessions, shoddy lab work, and victims and witnesses misidentifying perpetrators. </p>

		<p>Just more of the usual black whining.Instead of taking the smallest amount of responsibility &amp; corrective measures for their dysfunctional cluture they play the whine &amp; blame game. I live in KCMO where two blacks, Nunley &amp; Taylor kidnapped, raped, tortured &amp; murdered a 14 year old white girl that was waiting for a school bus. That was 20 years ago and they are still sitting on death row getting better medical care &amp; likely eating better than most Americans. So as far as I am concerned Wombley &amp; Parmon can shove their whine you know where.</p>

		<p>I agree with Anon at 11.01 AM. The death penalty should be abolished, but not because it is racist. Proportionate to their numbers, blacks commit more crimes of violence, including capital murder.</p>
<p>It should be abolished because it is horribly cruel (and brutalises the entire society), has no proven uniquely deterrent effect (over other strong sanctions, such as LWOP and long prison sentences) and, should a mistake be made, it is irreversible.</p>
<p>The argument from unique deterrence has long been discredited, except among those who want to believe in the effectiveness of the death penalty and are prepared to ignore the facts. If there were any direct correspondence between the use of the death penalty and a reduction in capital murders then Texas should have the lowest murder rate in the U.S. It doesn&rsquo;t. And murder rates in Europe, where there is no death penalty, are lower than those of the U.S. This points to social and cultural causes of violent crime. (As it happens, crime IS increasing in Europe, much of it on the back of mass Third-World immigration.)</p>
<p>It also puzzles me that many people who are otherwise sceptical about large government and generally favour a reduction in its powers should be prepared to concede to the state the literal power of life and death over its citizens in peacetime.</p>

		<p>Johnny English:</p>
<p>The statistics that show no deterrence are flawed because they are based on states that *have* the death penalty, not those that use it.  CA has it but rarely uses it.  The legit studies show anywhere from a three to twenty-four deterrent factor, i.e. somewhere between 3 and 24 murders do not happen because an execution is carried out.</p>
<p>Texas has a lot of blacks and Hispanics.  That&rsquo;s why it has a lot of murders.  Vermont is mostly white, therefore few murders.  Texas has the DP, VT does not.  But that&rsquo;s a bad comparison.  Compare states with similar racial compositions that do and do not have the death penalty.</p>
<p>How would you like to be a prison guard in a prison in a state with no death penalty and supervising a lot of lifers who have nothing to lose if they kill you?  Don&rsquo;t give me the bromide about ad/seg, SCOTUS says that you can only ad/seg for so long.</p>
<p>I predict that within 20 years, some European country will bring back the death penalty.  You have already said the reason why   &mdash;   increasing non-whites.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve just made my point for me: the incidence of murders is due to social and cultural factors, not the presence (or otherwise) of the death penalty. I suspect that your &#8220;legit studies&#8221; are the much-criticised econometric analyses that, quite apart from their methodologically flawed use of statistical and mathematical techniques, defy common sense by seeking to prove a negative.</p>
<p>As it happens, I think it likely (indeed, inevitable on current demographic trends) that European countries will bring back the death penalty, not in response to the crimes of the immigrants, but because the (predominantly Muslim) immigrants themselves will demand it as part of Sharia law when they become the majority.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t care whether the death penalty is or is not a deterrant.<br>
When you get a case of a pervert that has raped a twelve year old girl at gun-point, then gets let out after so-called &#8216;rehabilitation&rsquo; three years later, then does it again and again, due to our weak-kneed leaders, that could have been dealt in the proper fashion in the first place.<br>
And, the more cruel and unusual? Why not!</p>

		<p>Well Anonymous at 3:25 AM, I don&rsquo;t think any sane person would suggest that perverts who rape 12-year-old girls (or anyone else) at gunpoint should be let out to reoffend after a ridiculously short period like three years if at all. The greater the perceived risk from the individual, the more reason to keep them in prison indefinitely.</p>
<p>You might not be quite so keen on the death penalty (&#8220;the more cruel and unusual&#8221; the better) if it were you or one of your family wrongly convicted on false or ambiguous evidence or by an over-zealous judge or jury who - in the midst of a real or perceived crime wave - just wanted to make an example of somebody. This isn&rsquo;t bleeding-heart stuff, just common sense.</p>
<p>There have been a whole spate of exonerations in my native England in the last few years, where innocent men were remanded in connection with, or jailed for, murders they did not commit (Stefan Kisco, Colin Stagg, Barry George and others). If we still had the death penalty they&rsquo;d almost certainly have been hanged, and nobody would have been that keen to re-examine their cases. <br>

		<p>So when blacks are overrepresented when it comes to sports or government jobs, there&rsquo;s no complaints. Yet, when there are blacks in prison than whites, it&rsquo;s automatically considered racism. No ands ifs or buts.  Liberals say they treat blacks like equals, yet they are always pampering them and excusing their bad behavior.  So condescending</p>

		<p>Anonymous @3:25AM, sometimes the evidence that appears to implicate someone is later discounted by previously unknown evidence. </p>
<p>Question Diversity, I don&rsquo;t generally like to pose hypothetical questions because they tend to appeal to emotions rather than intellect, but the shoe can easily be placed on the other foot: how would you like to be one of the 100 people erroneously placed on death row in the last 25 years? See <a href="http://tinyurl.com/100exonerations" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/100exonerations</a></p>
<p>The possibility of human error exists in all trials, but at least when the person&rsquo;s life is spared, the error can be rectified.  </p>
