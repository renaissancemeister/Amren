<h1><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/gioia-diliberto/first-hair_b_192811.html">First Hair</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gioia Diliberto, Huffington Post, May 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In her first hundred days as First Lady, Michelle Obama has worn her hair mostly in a sleek page-boy, but also occasionally gently waved and upswept. Johnny Wright, the 31-year-old stylist from Frederic Fekkai&rsquo;s West Hollywood salon, who was anointed Michelle&rsquo;s exclusive hairdresser three months ago, has experimented a bit with the White House supermodel, giving her bangs for an appearance in Prague during the G20 Summit and a half up-do for her meeting with Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>What Wright hasn&rsquo;t and will never give Michelle, however, are twists, braids, ringlets, dreadlocks, or any other African-American style. Michelle hasn&rsquo;t worn her hair natural since she was a school girl. Only once on a vacation to Jamaica during her college years, did she wear braids, according to friends.</p>
<p>In Chicago, where until last January Michelle had lived her entire life with the exception of college and law school, most professional black women straighten their hair. Ethnic hair can be misinterpreted as defiant or militant, &#8220;and you don&rsquo;t want to do anything that&rsquo;s going to put you in a position where people can criticize you,&#8221; says Laura Washington, an African-American journalist. {snip}</p>
<p>A noted exception is Carole Brown, the Harvard educated financial expert, who succeeded Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett as board chairman of the Chicago Transit Authority. Her braids, which once cascaded around her shoulders but are now cut short, have caused not a stir in the press or the blogosphere. The trains and buses still run (sort of) on time.</p>
<p>But Carole Brown is not the First Lady. &#8220;It would be asking a lot of the American public,&#8221; to accept Michelle in ethnic hair, says Michael &#8220;Rahni&#8221; Flowers, who did Michelle&rsquo;s hair for 28 years, from the time she graduated from high school through the inauguration. &#8220;People assume it means something, when you have natural hair. It means militancy. It means defiance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most professional black men wear their hair like President Obama&rsquo;s in an extremely short, non-descript style that requires little care.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If Michelle wore her hair ethnic, adds an African-American friend from her Princeton days, &#8220;she&rsquo;d get attacked. She&rsquo;d get appreciation, too, mainly from black women, but she&rsquo;d get attacked for not looking the part. She also would be criticized generationally, regardless of race, so older black people would complain too, because it&rsquo;s too ethnic and not professional. A lot of black people have internalized this white standard of beauty, so they would lay into her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even with her straightened, non-ethnic hair, Michelle is changing how whites look at black women. What is perhaps most exciting about the new First Lady is not that she&rsquo;s the black Jackie Kennedy, but that she&rsquo;s freeing us from Jackie&rsquo;s polished perfection  &mdash;  an ideal based on white, European notions of beauty and elegance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The pale mainstream, of course.</b></p>
<p>While white people have fallen in love with Michelle for many of the right reasons  &mdash;  her intelligence, compassion, strength, humor and uncynical sense of moral duty  &mdash;  their adulation also allows them to congratulate themselves on their enlightened ideas about race: Here is a dark-skinned African-American woman with classic black features, and we relate to her totally! She&rsquo;s black, and she&rsquo;s one of us.</p>

			<p>She is not one of us, she will never be one of us, she is the symbol of our own destruction.</p>
<p>All I see in her is hate for white people, hate because she is smart enough to know that she is ugly, disgusting, not even blacks see her as good looking.</p>
<p>As for her intelligence, it is all affermative action, no more.</p>
<p>She can not even speak proper English after Harvard.</p>
<p>She is a propaganda weapon to be used against stupid liberals.</p>
<p>She and Hussein are a stain on America that will never be erased.<br>

			<p>One of the marks of a failing presidency is the amount of press coverage his wife gets.</p>
<p>It was only after Kennedy&rsquo;s failures with the Bay of Pigs and the Russian&rsquo;s raising of the Berlin Wall just a few weeks after Kruschev met with the obviously drug addled mentally and physically disabled Kennedy that the Kennedy publicity machine really pushed Jackie and her clothes to the forefront.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Michelle Obama has &ldquo;straightened, non-ethnic&rdquo; hair. &#8216;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Ethnic hair can be misinterpreted as defiant or militant,&#8221;</p>
<p>What do they mean by &#8220;ethnic&#8221;? Don&rsquo;t white people have ethnicity? Is OUR hair EVERY &#8220;interpreted as defiant or militant&#8221;?</p>
<p>Actually, the truth is there for all to see - black women hate their hair, and want to look like white women, hence Michelle Obama&rsquo;s refusal to allow her REAL hair to be seen. </p>
<p>When did a white woman ever have her hair styled to look like a black woman&rsquo;s? (Even if it were possible, which it isn&rsquo;t, thank God.)</p>
<p>Has Michelle Obama found her husband&rsquo;s birth certificate yet? Is he leaving her for the Teleprompter?</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s amazing what the liberals fusss about.  Not that taxpayers&rsquo; money is being spent on providing Michelle Obama with a full time hairdresser, but that she prefers to have non-kinky hair.  I for one do not care if Michelle Obama wears dreadlocks and puts a bone through her nose, I do care about the policies of Mr. Obama, most of which I disagree with.<br>

			<p>From a non-American point of view (I&rsquo;m an Australian), this just sounds crazy. I don&rsquo;t &#8216;relate&rsquo; to Michelle Obama on any level, or regard her as &#8216;one of us&rsquo;. I certainly don&rsquo;t see her as one of the world&rsquo;s most beautiful people. I recall reading during the presidential campaign that she faithfully attended a church (accompanied by her children) with a kill-whitie minister presiding who regularly gave hate rants against white Americans. Did that documented fact just disappear amidst all the &#8216;adulation&rsquo;?</p>
<p>&#8220;Jackie&rsquo;s polished perfection &mdash; an ideal based on white, European notions of beauty and elegance.&#8221; Give me &#8216;white European notions of beauty and elegance&rsquo; every time. </p>

<p>All right, it&rsquo;s one thing to write an article full of unquestioned assumptions like this one, but when the writer has to stoop to outright lying, it&rsquo;s going a little too far. <i>Uncynical</i> sense of moral duty??? This about the woman who, until recently, wasn&rsquo;t even proud of her own country??? The fact is that this article, like Mrs. Obama herself, is veritably dripping with cynicism, including the disparaging smear of whites as being &#8220;the pale mainstream.&#8221;</p>

			<p>excuse me for not using caps and other types of punctuation. my computer keyboard got partially wet and was damaged.</p>
<p>what i don&rsquo;t get is how white women worldwide are fawning over this woman who has made it clear in her writings from school she doesn&rsquo;t in general like white people at all. she followed with obama the insanely racist rev. wright who preached to them anti-americanism as well as racism regularly for twenty years. she made the statement - twice in one day - that &#8216;for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country&rsquo;. at this point axelrod or whoever was calling the shots with the obama campain put a muzzle on her. did anyone notice she was silenced from making public speeches or statements after that.</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it funny how being &#8216;natural&rsquo; in something as trivial as hair style is considered &#8216;ethnic&rsquo;. i wouldn&rsquo;t consider it akin to racial sterotypes like steppin fetchit or &#8216;amos and andy&rsquo;. are they denying their racial characteristics in the same way michael jackson - although he used extreme measures - denied his. do blacks attempt to sport white features when they can. although they&rsquo;d never admit it, i think in most cases they do.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s a little secret that almost all white women know, but apparently nobody else does:  Most of us don&rsquo;t wake up with the silky &#8216;white woman hair&rsquo; like you see in shampoo commercials.  </p>
<p>Of course it is usually easier for white women to &#8216;relax&rsquo; our hair than for black women, but we still have to condition, apply a product, blow dry, then often use a flat iron to get that sleek look.</p>
<p>VERY FEW white women have naturally sleek. silky, shiny hair.  We might have one of those qualities, but probably not all of them.</p>
<p>That said, why are we discussing Mrs. Obama&rsquo;s hair, exactly?</p>

<p>Oh please - has anyone ever seen a more naked example of projecting one&rsquo;s own narrow, personal beliefs upon others on a mass scale?! Outside the Mainstream media, Hollywood, the beltway and a tiny, select group of hypocritical, wealthy bleeding-heart elites in every US city, no White people really even care about Mrs. Obama, let alone have fallen in love with the woman!  </p>
<p>Even many hardcore leftists are a little queasy about the Obamas, as alas, they have not proven nearly liberal enough for that crowd.  </p>

<p>White women tourists in Africa  routinely get  their hair  done in local African styles  &mdash;  braids adorned with tiny artificial bits of jewelry. And they seem to like the results. They also  routinely wear African gowns and jewelry as they traipse around  town.</p>
<p>I have  also noted that some  white  women turn their hair frizzy by applying chemicals.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s me or what, and I kind of feel weird commenting on something like looks, (I&rsquo;m no Brad Pitt), but c&rsquo;mon, Michelle Obama might be ok in the looks department, but she&rsquo;s not beautiful. I mean, her face is so-so, just regular I think, and from the waist up, she&rsquo;s ok, but her big bottom and bowed legs don&rsquo;t cut it with me. Why do you think she&rsquo;s always wearing something to hide them?</p>

An analogy from the world of pop music:</p>
<p>The Jimi Hendrix Experience was Hendrix backed by a bassist and a drummer who were both white, British men. Hendrix, by all accounts, was not &#8220;a race man,&#8221; generally got along with white people, and liked his UK collaborators just fine. With them behind him, the bi-racial Jimi Hendrix Experience achieved huge worldwide popularity. </p>
<p>But after a few years of this success, more militant blacks started pressuring Hendrix to dump his white group and play with black musicians exclusively. Hendrix eventually gave in to that pressure, dissolved the Experience, and replaced them (just shortly before he died in 1970) with a new, all-black group called the Band of Gypsies. </p>
<p>Why am I telling you this? Because I predict that if (G*d forbid!) Obama gets a second term, whatever &#8220;post-racial&#8221; niceties he and his bigoted shrew of a wife have been observing will be cast aside like Jimi&rsquo;s British musicians. If even a relatively non-racial black like JH be bullied into pan-African solidarity, an extremely racially-conscious black like Michelle Obama will too   &mdash;   only she won&rsquo;t need nearly as much persuading. </p>
<p>If Michelle has to listen for four years to HuffPo (plus who knows how many others) hinting that a TRUE black woman shouldn&rsquo;t be conking her curls, then sometime around 2013 or 2014, she will dump the white hair products and the white stylists who apply them to her, and start sporting a more &#8220;natural&#8221; and &#8220;authentic&#8221; (read: &#8220;ghetto&#8221;) look. In all probability, a short &#8216;fro. </p>
<p>At which point, her transformation into Angela &#8220;Sweet Black Angel&#8221; Davis will be complete. </p>
<p>And Barack, for his part, will start dressing and acting more &#8220;authentically black&#8221; too. Before 2016 rolls around I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see him holding press conferences dressed head-to-toe in Chicago Bulls sportswear. </p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s funny, I have not run across anyone, not one person, that even notices or mentions Michelle Obama&rsquo;s hair or cares what style she wears. If she were to wear dreadlocks or have naturally curly hair, I wouldn&rsquo;t care and neither would anyone else, only the media, which often makes a fuss about a white woman&rsquo;s hair. However, the public doesn&rsquo;t care about such nonsense.</p>

<p>Illogical comparison.  Citing the exception, even if what you say is true, (and applying chemicals for &#8220;FRIZZY&#8221; hair really is a bizarre claim) doesn&rsquo;t even begin to parallel a practise that is so widespread it&rsquo;s almost universal.</p>

<p>You mean like Angela Davis?  If she kept her fro short and well-groomed she&rsquo;d look even more black.  What&rsquo;s the problem?<br>

			<p>She doesnt straighten her hair because she is afraid of showing &#8220;militancy&#8221;! Black women always straighten their hair,for the obvious reason that they envy other womens hair. She is extremely unattractive. I myself have yet to &#8220;fall in love with her&#8221;!! Did they write such idiotic comments about Laura Bush  &mdash;  -a plain jane but still far more attractive than Michelle.</p>

			<p>I work for a very large insurance company in Iowa. We (white) females were called into a meeting last year and WARNED that fluffing our hair around (black) females, is taken as an insult by the blacks and we were told Not To Do It or we would be disciplined.</p>

			<p>The point is not whether a person is attractive or not. </p>
<p>The point is, what does that person attract? </p>
<p>You can attract attention and /or comment without being &#8216;pretty&rsquo;, &#8216;beautiful&rsquo;, &#8216;gorgeous&rsquo;, &#8216;stunning&rsquo; or whatever. </p>
<p>My opinion is that Mrs. Obama is none of the above. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen females who run a fast food stand in DC who are far more pretty, beautiful, gorgeous and stunning than this overrated woman.</p>

			<p>I believe her hairsyles would have a negative impact on Black women. They should not be forced to torture themselves at salons with dangerous chemicals and weaves. Of course this is all a windfall to black beauticians, so it can&rsquo;t all be bad. Michelle Obama&rsquo;s hair looks awful anyway and she would do better with a weave. I think Barry&rsquo;s &#8216;do is a Ceasar. And Michelle made it abundantly clear that America must leave it&rsquo;s white roots behind. America was the most successful democracy known to man so it&rsquo;s ripe for ruining by hate-mongers. My belief is that Obama hates everyone because of his difficulties being half and half. He just as well can be called a &#8220;white&#8221; man as a &#8220;black&#8221; man and only chose the latter because of the protection it gave him. As a &#8220;white&#8221; man, he never would have even won the party candidacy.</p>

<p>She looks &#8216;too hard&rsquo; for my liking, her jaw always looks clenched like she&rsquo;s restraining her anger and I think she looks more masculine than Hussein himself.<br>
Who has a soft look about him, like someone who has never really had it hard (well other than all the racism he encountered from his grandmother of course).<br>
But then preceptions of beauty are subjective aren&rsquo;t they, and a reflection of your inner values.<br>
And if you find her attractive, you&rsquo;re the lucky one because we all have at least another 1000 days of staring at her mug.</p>

<p>I agree with you. I cannot see the motivation that some of you have in making such nasty, mean-spirited comments about this woman&rsquo;s phyisical feautres. </p>
<p>She has great shoulders, a great figure, is radiant looking, is in great shape and probably is in better health than most people in their 20s. Such negative remarks are groundless. </p>
<p>These are not the sort of comments that help our movement. If anything, they drive more reasonable minded Whites away.<br>

			<p>Black women change their hairstyles a lot. Some use chemicals, others don&rsquo;t. The ethnic-identity-tied-to-a-hotcomb debate died long ago. Not big deal.</p>

You&rsquo;re right on target with your comments.The article is full of cliches and dated thinking.<br>
Frankly, I&rsquo;m tired of the preoccupation with black people&rsquo;s hair.I don&rsquo;t think that much about my own hair  &mdash;  just shampoo it,style it,and then forget about it for the rest of the day  &mdash;  so I certainly don&rsquo;t want to think about  someone else&rsquo;s hairstyle.I don&rsquo;t care to.</p>
<p>I will say this:Michelle Obama is an attractive woman;she always looks nice.</p>

			<p>You people are the very reason that conservatives and republicans are called racist. I am a black conservative and I catch hell for being for that because the perception that most conservatives are like those of you on this tread.</p>
<p>Natural hair is not &#8220;ghetto&#8221;, in fact some of the most &#8220;ghetto&#8221; hairstyles involve weaves and straigthened hair.</p>
<p>Black women do not hate their hair and a perm is not a sign of &#8220;self-hatred&#8221;. I am no Obama supporter and I think all of this Michelle love is ridiculous. But to think that you people think that blacks want to look like you is INCREDIBLY FUNNY. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only natural to be attracted to those who look like you and I don&rsquo;t fault you for that. But to assume that black people hate the way they look is sophomoric, daft actually. I love my hair (which is natural) and I flat iron it to wear straight because it looks pretty&hellip;not because it looks white  &mdash;   because it doesn&rsquo;t. White women also change the texture of their hair with flat irons and perms as well! </p>
<p>This was the silliest string of comments I have ever read on this forum.  You guys are utterly clueless. </p>
