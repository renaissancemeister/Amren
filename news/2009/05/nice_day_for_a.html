			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lizzie Smith, Daily Mail (London), May 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They are usually one of Hollywood&rsquo;s most stylish couples, but Heidi Klum and Seal really let down their guard to renew their wedding vows in Malibu yesterday.</p>
<p>The pair, who have been married for four years, were in high spirits as they celebrated the playful fancy dress occasion with guests including Matthew Perry and Debra Messing.</p>
<p>Their theme seemed to be &#8216;white trash&rsquo;  &mdash;  something that pregnant bride Heidi certainly lived up to with her braided hair, low cut jumpsuit and bejewelled accessories.</p>
<p>The barefoot 35-year-old was even spotted with a cigarette hanging from her heavily glossed lips.</p>
<p>For the sake of her fourth child let&rsquo;s hope that this was as fake as her silver plastic nails.</p>
<p>One thing that was completely genuine, however, was the romance.</p>
<p>Heidi and Seal were inseparable, exchanging kisses and happy smiles as they gleefully celebrated, with the help of their three young children.</p>
<p>British singer Seal wore an American flag shirt and quiff wig for the service, which was watched by around 100 equally outlandishly dressed guests.</p>
<p>They listened to rock and roll and danced at the waterfront house, which belongs to a friend of the couple.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day Seal and Heidi posed for a photoshoot on the balcony of the house in Malibu, California.</p>
<p>Dressed in a short skirt, high heels and crop top, Heidi rubbed her swollen stomach as Seal stood by.</p>
<p>The couple first married in 2005, but have renewed their vows every year since the service.</p>
<p>&#8216;We love it. It&rsquo;s great saying your vows again,&rsquo; said Seal.</p>
<p>&#8216;You remember who it was you fell in love with. It&rsquo;s also a good excuse to have a big party, and we have a different theme every year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Seal recently revealed the couple are expecting a baby girl.</p>
<p>They already have two sons  &mdash;  Henry GÃ¼nther, 3, and Johan Riley, 2  &mdash;  and raise daughter Leni, 5, from Heidi&rsquo;s prior relationship with Formula 1 boss Flavio Briatore.</p>

			<p>Yep. It&rsquo;ll always be just fine to make fun of &#8220;white trash&#8221;, or whites in general.  Wonder if the British press would be as thrilled with a &#8220;Paki&#8221; or other such wedding spoof.  Oh and if you really want to be sickened just read the readers comments on the dailymail site.  Don&rsquo;t waste your time trying to comment on it, they won&rsquo;t print anything we have to say about it.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed the slow downslide of Heidi since she married the Seal. Seems to happen that way with White women who lie down with the &#8220;other&#8221;.<br>
Of course he&rsquo;s happier than a pig in you know what! I really don&rsquo;t get it. </p>

			<p>Looking at his picture there (or any of his pictures) makes me think &#8220;what is she thinking?&#8221;.  As a Christian I think we are all God&rsquo;s children and that a black woman is naturally, and should be, well suited to find this man attractive.  I think every race has their own purpose and path to happiness, but differences also need to be recognized, and the races should live separately in their own societies.  I just don&rsquo;t get what she sees in a guy who looks so different from her.</p>

			<p>Disgusting. Heidi truly makes me ill, and she is held up as a role model for White children? She is the one that is truly &#8220;white trash&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is fine and dandy to ridicule and have a &#8220;white trash&#8221; party, yet let us reverse that and have a White couple have a black ghetto thug party.</p>

			<p>Only three years away from the seven year itch for him.  Though he has never struck me as the most astute of fellows, so the seven year itch might be a few years too late.  In that gitup, though, trysts won&rsquo;t be that easy to come by.</p>

			<p>&#8220;British singer&#8221; That&rsquo;s definately the most obvious way to describe Seal.</p>
<p>I recall being at a red carpet celebrity gathering a few years ago and was conversing with someone who referred to &#8220;Seal&#8221;. Having no idea who that was I asked &#8220;who&rsquo;s Seal?&#8221; My associate immediately pointed into the crowd and said &#8220;that British guy over there&#8221; </p>
<p>Needless to say I instantly picked him out from that accurate description and no further explanation was needed.</p>

<p>I too am a Christian, and I agree with you 100%!  After all, God created the nations.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re mixed, you really don&rsquo;t have loyalty to one race/culture or another.</p>
<p>Granted we are all one in Christ, but while we&rsquo;re on this earth, in our physical bodies, there are the physical differences.</p>

<p>          Courtney, </p>
<p>          As a Christian you also realize that racial <br>
          differences are meaningless for Jesus Christ.  </p>
<p>          Since we are all created by God, then it basically<br>
          makes no difference if a White person and non-White<br>
          person love one another.   Ultimately, what matters <br>
          more is the after-life and not this life.  In the <br>
          after-life, race has no place.    </p>
<p><br>
          How long are you going to be in your White body,<br>
          Courtney?  Another 30 years maybe, give or take? <br>
          So what is going to happen after you leave your <br>
          body?  You are confusing your body with your soul.<br>
          Your White body is like a vehicle and you(ie. the <br>
          soul) is the driver.  Your vehicle(ie body)is going<br>
          to have an expiry date.   </p>
<p>          You cannot attain God if you are a racist.  Being a <br>
          racist takes you away from God and the heavenly<br>
          after-life.  Unless you can learn to love and <br>
          accept people for who they are and not develop <br>
          aversion simply because of some color reason, you <br>
          won&rsquo;t merit Heaven and God&rsquo;s love.     </p>
<p><br>
          Has it occurred to you that maybe Heidi Klum sees<br>
          something in Seal beyond his external appearance? <br>
          That maybe he is a really cool guy in private and <br>
          is actually amiable in nature?   </p>
<p>          Why do you assume that Klum should necessarily <br>
          develop prejudice to Seal on the basis of his <br>
          looks?  There is more to a person than his/her<br>
          looks!</p>

<p>Not anymore. I see more and more black-white couples where they both look well groomed and from good upbringings. It&rsquo;s mostly white women with black boyfriends. It goes to show just how impressionable females really are. They believe whatever they are shown because they have a need to be seen as nice conformists. It&rsquo;s a virtue that turns into a vice when the role models are selfish and destructive. First it was Sex &amp; the City, now they all want to make little miniature Obamas, just like they saw on TV and magazine covers. </p>

<p>Race goes way beyond just skin color.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the fact that Canaan was cursed  &mdash;  a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren.  That&rsquo;s why blacks are the way they are today.</p>
<p>Using your logic, one could also justify &#8220;gay marriage.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Heidi&rsquo;s daughter with the Italian guy looks exactly like her so her bloodline will continue through her. In pictures I&rsquo;ve seen of her and her two sons she just looks like a woman carrying around two random black kids. Note, too, she gave them German names.</p>

			<p>There is most definitely something to be learned from these types of relationships and why it seems, celebrity black man generally gravitate towards nordic blonde women.  Seal, Tiger Woods, OJ Simpson (of course, we know how that one turned out). James Earl Jones (although I&rsquo;ll bet his wife was quite beautiful when she was younger), Clarence Thomas, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Of course, there isn&rsquo;t an iota of attraciveness in Seal.  And I say that because when I look at Denzel Washington, I can honestly say that, although I wouldn&rsquo;t date or marry him, he is attractive for a black man.</p>
<p>On the reverse, you have attractive black women who gravitate towards white guys. However, not as many as black men.  Halle Berry comes to mind.  Here is an attractive mixed race woman, who was married to TWO black men and had no children by either one.  She then meets some attractive white model and bingo, becomes pregnant and has a daughter.  </p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m not a psychologist and couldn&rsquo;t even begin to explain these relationships, it reminds me of something my mother used to say when I was younger.  That black people wanted to be white so bad they could taste it.  Why else would they straighten their hair and lighten their skin.  They may say they hate whitey and yell it at the top of their lungs but I think that black men and black women who marry whites feel like it the closest they will ever get to actually being white.  Of course, on the other hand, my husband says it&rsquo;s just a way to mutt up our race.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I almost gagged when I read your post. The following is a excerpt from a interview on their first meeting&hellip;..</p>
<p>&#8216;Heidi Klum And Seal Tell About Their Raunchy Hook-Up&rsquo; <br>
24 October 2007<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/rxmu8p" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/rxmu8p</a><br>
<i>&#8220;I met him in a hotel lobby in New York City and he came in just from the gym and I was sitting there and I was, like, wow,&#8221; Klum told Oprah. <br>
&#8220;And I pretty much saw everything,&#8221; Klum recalls about her husband who was then wearing bicycle shorts. &#8220;The whole package.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>Do you still think Heidi Klum is on a higher spiritual plane?<br>
Please.<br>
Have you got a daughter Sam? would you be proud of hearing her say something like that?<br>
I&rsquo;m curious out of the Tutsi&rsquo;s and the Hutu&rsquo;s, which one of them will get in heaven?</p>

			<p>I have always known Beauty Is Only Skin Deep, if this female were my daughter I would be so ashamed of her and what she had done to our family with her total disregard of who and what she is to lay down with such a creature. I turn off ANY commercial I see her traitor face in and would never buy any product this pathetic excuse for a woman pimps. She seems so proud of what she has done when in my mind SHAME should be what she feels. BOYCOTT WHAT SHE PIMPS ON TV AND ELSEWHERE, let her sell her good to her newly selected people in the Congo.</p>

<p>Actually, no.  If you remember learning about meiosis when you took Biology in high school, a child only inherits half of the genetic material that will eventually make up its genome from each parent.  The genes that make up our external physical appearance (hair color &amp; texture, eye color, skin color &amp; texture, etc) are only a small percentage of the total number of genes in the human genome.  There are innumerable internal biochemical processes.</p>
<p>To be sure, however, Klum&rsquo;s 1/2-Italian daughter (her name is Helene, I do believe) will undoubtedly share a lot more DNA in common with her mother than her 1/2-black siblings due to the simple fact Germans and Italians are of the same race.  That would make her more closely related to her mother than them.  Try explaining that fact to the multicultural crowd.</p>
<p>Heidi Klum is, in the words of my late Italian grandfather, a &#8220;family disgrace.&#8221;  I&rsquo;m being kind because how I really feel about her can&rsquo;t be printed here.</p>

<p>I am sorry to disagree with you on this Anonymous, but he&rsquo;s really happier than a pig in: a puddle, a mound, or a septic tank, filled with Comrade Heidi Klum!</p>
<p>I would call her the pig wallowing in the excrement that he is happier than, but that would be an insult to worldwide swinedom!  </p>
<p><br>
As for Comrade Sam Slater, regarding this wretched nonsense: </p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot attain God if you are a racist. Being a <br>
racist takes you away from God and the heavenly<br>
after-life. Unless you can learn to love and <br>
accept people for who they are and not develop <br>
aversion simply because of some color reason, you <br>
won&rsquo;t merit Heaven and God&rsquo;s love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How do you presume, in your arrogance and sanctimony, what God wants or will accept Comrade Sam?</p>
<p>Did he come to you last night and tell you that Courtney and all the other &ldquo;racists&rdquo; will not go to Heaven, or is that simply your &ldquo;educated&rdquo; guess or opinion? Did it ever occur to you that God saw fit to make: myself, Courtney, and all the other &ldquo;racists,&rdquo; as you see fit to label as such? Moreover, have you ever considered the Marxist underpinnings of multiculturalism, and its decidedly anti-Christian foundations that distinctly reflect the atheistic nature of Marxism?</p>
<p>I know, that is a lot for you to fully comprehend, so take your time in responding; however, if you never do, we &ldquo;racists&rdquo; will also understand that as well. You see Comrade Sam, it is not uncommon for one of your kind to play the blame and shame bomb throwing game, and then never be manly enough to debate the tactics, to say nothing of the &ldquo;ideals,&rdquo; that were employed as so much garishly applied rouge on your face as your camouflage at the time. </p>
<p>In fact, that particular brand of cosmetically applied hypocrisy is not only unsurprising around here Comrade Sam, it is expected,</p>

<p>I said in my post that &#8220;we are all God&rsquo;s children&#8221;.  I believe He loves Aborigines and Africans just as much as He loves Europeans.  However, God also created the different races as well as their differences.

<p>I have to disagree. While it is true that more females go with blacks, there are pleny of males who marry outside their race though not with blacks and buy into the multicult fantasy, just look at all these male college professors, media people and such pushing multicult.</p>

			<p>I certainly change the channel now when Heidi is prancing around in her bra on the Victoria&rsquo;s Secret commercials. I always enjoyed VS commercials before but it&rsquo;s funny how quickly unattractive someone can become when you learn what they really are. Regardless of the genuine musical ability he may have, Seal looks more like a caveman than any living human being I can think of off the top of my head. Seems like a desparate move on Heidi&rsquo;s part to stay in the limelight as her modeling career enters its twilight. Just like Madonna, except one takes in a child, the other takes in a 46-year-old man.</p>

Sorry, but I did&hellip; You are saying only what you have been brainwashed to say.. all your pc garbage and applying it to God is what is unforgivable. A &#8220;racist&#8221; won&rsquo;t make it to heaven? Which preacher out there told you that one? Do you honestly believe the diluting (misceganation) of the races will get you into heaven? Destroying what God made? Maybe you better look up many verses that you have obviously ignored and look up the meaning of some of those words in Hebrew and Greek&hellip;.</p>

			<p>According to the Holy Scriptures, the only sin, if it can be called sin, that these two committed was in getting married.</p>
<p>Paul said that it is better to marry than to burn with lust, as Heidi apparently did when she saw Seal in his skin-tights (for the scriptures do not countenance promiscuity).</p>
<p>The Bible means what it says when it states: There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>There are no cultural distinctions, fleshly distinctions, economic distinctions, sexual distinctions (for in the kingdom, there will be no marriage, no need for it, with all being made complete in Christ Jesus)  &mdash;  NO DISTINCTIONS.</p>
<p>So Seal and Heidi have not violated any of God&rsquo;s commands, or any promptings of the Spirit.</p>
<p>If you think they have, you will have to do a much better job in your exegesis.</p>

			<p>Charles Darwin correctly noted that the different species of finches on the various Galapagos islands had all originated from a common ancestor and then branched off.  </p>
<p>Because the finches on each island were isolated both geographically and reproductively from other finches on other islands, mutations that arose to allow for adaptation to differing conditions were not absorbed back into a one size fits all finch, and the finches became different species incapable of bearing viable offspring with finches on other islands.</p>
<p>The races of man dance to the same laws as the finches.</p>
<p>The basic human type appears to have dark skin and African features. All others branched off. The difference is that we have not yet made the leap into being different species incapable of bearing viable offspring. But, maybe that day will come.</p>
<p>Those such as Klum are destroying their mutations by allowing them to be bred out of their family lines and they are being absorbed back into the darker human mass. Klum and others who have done what she has done are short circuiting the  evolutionary track their family lines were on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for white family to become black.  Just mate with a black and you&rsquo;re on your way.</p>

			<p>&#8220;While I&rsquo;m not a psychologist and couldn&rsquo;t even begin to explain these relationships, it reminds me of something my mother used to say when I was younger. That black people wanted to be white so bad they could taste it. Why else would they straighten their hair and lighten their skin. They may say they hate whitey and yell it at the top of their lungs but I think that black men and black women who marry whites feel like it the closest they will ever get to actually being white. Of course, on the other hand, my husband says it&rsquo;s just a way to mutt up our race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simple.  </p>

<p>          Courtney, </p>
<p>          In my above post, my basic emphasis was on the fact <br>
          that we all have to die someday whether we are White,<br>
          Black, Brown, Yellow ect ect.  Your feeling of racial<br>
          difference is largely due to the fact that you are <br>
          still living (ie.as a White person).  What happens<br>
          when you die?  Will you still remain White??   </p>
<p><br>
          The point I am making is that harping about and <br>
          getting fixated about race ultimately doesn&rsquo;t solve<br>
          anything because life itself is ephemeral and <br>
          temporary.   Hence, getting worked up about race is<br>
          essentially counter-productive.  </p>
<p>           <br>
          I suspect that the real reason that Whites dislike <br>
          Blacks is not because of their race/color itself <br>
          but rather the fact that Blacks are not as much an<br>
          accomplished people like other races.  On the other <br>
          hand, quite a number of the posters here don&rsquo;t seem<br>
          to have any problem if Whites intermarry with Asians<br>
          for example.  </p>
<p>          I remember reading a quote from a poster called <br>
          &#8220;School Teacher&#8221; :  </p>
<p>          &#8220;Whites who date/marry Asians may have left our race<br>
           but they haven&rsquo;t left civilization&#8221;.   </p>
<p>          &#8221; I don&rsquo;t get the same sense of Bestiality  <br>
            when I see a White person with an Asian as I do <br>
            when I see Whites and Blacks together&#8221;.  </p>
<p>   <br>
          Anyway life is short.  Why waste it in racial disdain<br>
          and hatred?  Also if God created us humans, then he <br>
          must have created us &#8220;Black&#8221; in the beginning and <br>
          not as separate races as you say Courtney.<br>

            Courtney,  </p>
<p>            The basic problem with segregation is that it won&rsquo;t<br>
            work in a manner that is fair to all the races in <br>
            America.  If segregation was something good, then <br>
            why did the blacks want integration in the first <br>
            place?   </p>
<p>            And secondly who is going to enforce segregation<br>
            in a supposedly fair manner?  A White government?<br>
            A Black government?  A Black and White government?</p>
<p>            Where is the evidence that a White govt will be fair<br>
            to the non-Whites when it enforces Segregation?</p>
<p>            Where is the evidence that a Black govt will be fair<br>
            to Whites when it enforces Segregation?  </p>
<p>            If a govt combined of White and Black can make <br>
            segregation fair to everyone, then it disproves the<br>
            need for segregation as Black and White can <br>
            cooperate at the govt level, so then why not at the<br>
            common level??   In other words, segregation fails<br>
            on its own premise.  Integration is then the only<br>
            way.  </p>

<p>But what they fail to see, at least Ms. Klum, is that they don&rsquo;t have to PRETEND to be white trash, she IS white trash   &mdash;    living and incarnate.  All she has to do is be herself.</p>
<p>Just having a pretty, photogenic, face and good bone structure doesn&rsquo;t mean she has anything inside that vacant head.</p>
<p>And external beauty is fleeting, as she will learn.  In a few short years, she will find herself a wrinkled and aging women with several spoiled mulatto offspring, by then grown and probably getting into all kinds of trouble, a source of endless headaches. </p>
<p>Good luck, Heidi! You&rsquo;re probably going to need it.<br>

<p>Speaking for myself, rather than saying that  &#8220;we are all God&rsquo;s chidren&#8221;, I would consider that we are all members of the Human species, with different branches [races]. (Basically the same thing, just different terminology.)

<p>With all due respect Courtney, I do not find your arguments particularly convincing.  If you believe in God so firmly (to the extent that Christ is all-conquering), why are you so against certain marital outcomes of our God-given emotions?  Love after all, is arguably the most powerful of human emotions, and if God intended that our capabilities to love someone be restricted exclusively to members of our own race, surely interracial love would be impossible(after all, you said we are all God&rsquo;s children, thus God is our universal maker, right?). </p>
<p>To pre-empt those who argue that I&rsquo;m confusing love with lust, it seems silly to claim that ALL interracial marriages are motivated by lust, devoid of any feelings of love.  If you believe that, I think you are being too judgmental or even somewhat mean spirited.  After all how do you know what&rsquo;s going on in a couple&rsquo;s mind?  I don&rsquo;t either, but considering that marriage is a huge personal commitment, it is far more convincing to me that individuals who bother going through it usually love each other (now there are exceptions). And as Christians, who are we to judge anyway; in fact, isn&rsquo;t &#8220;Judge not that ye be not judged&#8221; one of Christ&rsquo;s fundamental insructions?    </p>

<p>There is no God.  The Atheists are right.  If there was a God, there would be no (1) Affirmative action (2) Out of control black on white crime (3) The American government would not be in the middle of a successful 100 year program to exterminate White Americans.</p>
<p>Remember what that rich elitist aristocratic communist Lord Bertrand Russell said.</p>
<p>&#8220;God is supposed to be all powerful, all knowing and all good.<br>
Horrible, dreadful thiings happen all the time.  Good people are destroyed and evil people triumph.</p>
<p>Were God all good, and all powerful he would not permit evil to happen.</p>
<p>God therefore, is either powerless to prevent evil or has the power to prevent evil but permits it because he, she or it is evil&#8221;</p>
<p>Christianity is one of the founding stones of Western Civilization, but since WW2 it has formed a large part of the anti White coalition.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t advocate going back to the ancient pagans, but White Nationalists need to be very aware that the Christian churches are as much our enemy as the US Judiciary, ADL, AJC, ACLU, NAACP, SPLC NOW and the United States Government. </p>

			<p>Sam Slater,</p>
<p>As another poster pointed out, if we are not to worry about race differences why worry about anything at all?  My direct answer is that we have concern for our children and our children&rsquo;s children.  It is selfish to only be focused on yourself in the sense that &#8220;I won&rsquo;t be here much longer&#8221;.  </p>
<p>As for your comment about God creating us black in the beginning, I believe that the races came originally out of Africa and then later separated and evolved as they did, but God had a hand in it, as He does everything that happens.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get what you are going into in your post on segregation.  If segregation wouldn&rsquo;t be fair for all races as you say, then maybe this is evidence as to why a multiracial nation doesn&rsquo;t work in the first place.  You are answering your own questions here.  The reason blacks wanted integration in the first place is because whites created better institutions and neighborhoods than they did.  Integration benefits minorities but it is of very very little value to whites.</p>
