<h1><a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6261408.ece">Silvio Berlusconi Under Fire Over Anti-Immigration Remarks</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Times of London, May 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian Prime Minister, today came under fire from the Catholic Church as well as the Left after declaring that Italy was not and should not be a multi-ethnic society.</p>
<p>Mr Berlusconi&rsquo;s centre Right coalition won power a year ago partly by vowing to crack down on crime and illegal immigration. This weekend he praised Libya for taking back 500 would be migrants who have been intercepted by Italian naval vessels over the past five days, under a new Italian-Libyan accord.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Left&rsquo;s idea is of a multi-ethnic Italy,&#8221; Mr Berlusconi told a news conference. &#8220;That is not our idea, ours is to welcome only those who meet the conditions for political asylum.&#8221;</p>
<p>Italy was once itself a country of emigrants, but now sees itself as in the front line of an assault by poor and often desperate African, Asian and other migrants trying to get into Europe. The centre Left opposition however condemned Mr Berlusconi&rsquo;s remarks as racist.</p>
<p>Dario Franceschini, head of the Democratic Party, the main opposition force, said &#8220;It is not for me or Berlusconi or anyone else to decide. This will be the century of multi-ethnic societies. France, Great Britain and Germany are European nations with far more immigrants than us, but they have worked for integration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Monsignor Mariano Crociata, secretary of the Italian Bishops Conference (CEI), defended multiculturalism as a &#8220;value&#8221; that already existed in Italy. However the anti immigrant Northern League, which is a member of the Berlusconi coalition and controls the Interior Ministry, hailed the interception and deportation of migrants, saying said it was &#8220;a revolutionary change from the past&#8221;. Last week there was an outcry when the League suggested some Milan Metro carriages should be reserved for Milanese only, though it later said it was not a serious proposal.</p>

Why is it that the Left always claims its ideas are to be implemented, inevitably?  It started with Marx, and has spread to practically every Leftist since.<br>

			<p>The powerfull enablers of &#8220;chaos&#8221;(the left) exist in every western nation(eastern ones have no use for them) and WILL, without a doubt, cause a catastrophe in those nations sooner or later. Conservatives have no voice and will be trampled under by shear force.</p>

			<p>Dario Franceschini, head of the Democratic Party, the main opposition force, is likely to stay head of the main &#8216;opposition&rsquo; force.  As comments like these, along with that other person from his party saying that it wasn&rsquo;t up to Italians to decide whether or not they wanted Italy to be multi-ethnic, are ensuring that parties like the anti immigrant Northern League (which I like far more than Silvio Berlusconi), gain more and more power.</p>

<p>TRUE. BUT THEY WERE LEGAL IMMIGRANTS NOT ILLEGAL ALIENS.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will be the century of multi-ethnic societies&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Translation. The prosperous and advanced White nations will lose their historic identity and be swamped with black, brown and yellow peoples while those same black, brown and yellow countries will remain black, brown and yellow. Only the White countries will become multi-ethnic - through no wish of their own.</p>

I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be plenty &#8220;Go Berlusconi!&#8221; sentiment on this thread already, so I&rsquo;ll save my breath and comment on this sub-point instead: </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Last week there was an outcry when the League suggested some Milan Metro carriages should be reserved for Milanese only, though it later said it was not a serious proposal.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Even if it wasn&rsquo;t meant as a serious proposal, I see no compelling moral or ethical reason why it should not be. </p>
<p>And yes, I would agree with it even if it meant that, as a non-Milanese myself, I couldn&rsquo;t ride in those (presumably 1st Class) carriages either. The locals are, I believe, entitled to decide if they&rsquo;d rather have me ride with the non-locals. As a tourist I might not like being stuck with the Afro-Arab immigrants in the 2nd Class carriages   &mdash;   but if that&rsquo;s what the people of Milan voted for then I would respect that and co-operate with that policy. </p>
<p>Because I would know that such policy meant that white European peoples had, after losing ground for decades, finally succeeded in reversing their decline. It would mean that Italians were once again determining their own ethnic future   &mdash;   rather than having it determined for them by outside forces like the EU. </p>
<p>And I betcha those trains would run on time, too! </p>

			<p>A person that has many personality&rsquo;s is considered a disorder&hellip;.generaly speeking its seems the same goes for organically evolved country&rsquo;s. Coercing Multi-ethnicity on old world nations is actually the forced schizophrenia of its natural developement or inherent personality. There is a global attempt of marxist types or hyena&rsquo;s if you will, that using a facade of equality,compassion, love, religion,&hellip;etc. are ever vigilant in trying to undermine the white race at an economic and more specifically Genetic level. </p>

<p>But Mr.Franceschini, you and the Left want to decide that that society and others should be &#8220;multi-ethnic.&#8221; Somebody has to decide and face it, in ANY country, the vast majority of people do NOT want mass immigration or large scale multiculturalism, though many people won&rsquo;t openly admit it. The Left wants to foist it&rsquo;s ideological views off on the average person.</p>

			<p>How many &#8220;mutli-ethnic societies&#8221; will there be outside of Europe, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand? Approximately none. How many non-white politicians crow like white leftists about the impending displacement and disenfranchisement of their own people? Again, roughly zero.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not for me or Berlusconi or anyone else to decide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t it for Italian politicians to decide the immigration policies of Italy? Aren&rsquo;t they put into office exactly to handle matters like these? I have no Italian blood at all but it sickens me to see the nation of Dante, Michelangelo and Petrarch pretending that waves of third-world primitives are some sort of great boon to Italy. And when did the European left adopt the doltish &#8220;we&rsquo;re a nation of immigrants&#8221; nonsense? Even if it were true, how would that fact oblige Europeans to accept a third-world invasion?</p>

			<p>It should come as no surprise that the Left is behind the multicultural movement. The Left&rsquo;s overriding goal is the degradation of the nation-state with the &#8220;replacement&#8221; being the supra-national idealistic state. I put replacement in scare quotes because of course the ideal state never comes into existence. Communism precipitates the breakdown of the nation yet nothing follows in its wake but the predictable consequence of breakdown: inertia, fear, retrograde social forms, degeneracy. </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m always amazed at the positions of the Catholic Church in these matters of immigration and multiculturalism. I don&rsquo;t see rhyme or reason coming from it.</p>
<p>In the archives here at AmRen you can find strong arguments that Christianity and the bible are not opposed to patriotism or the existence of nations. The Catholic Church should butt out of the current debate. Even worse, the church has been giving apologies for historical grievances where the church was partially responsible but which also involved ethnic conflicts of interest. All apologies from the church should specifically exclude assigning blame for what are ethnic concerns. Conflicts involving rates of population growth, cultural heritage, competition for resources, or competition for political power carry large consequences which fall outside the domain of theology.  </p>
<p>How can the church be so insane as to permit large Islamic immigration to Europe? Does it believe that Muslims will see the light and mass convert to Catholicism? It&rsquo;s far more likely that a century from now almost all Europeans will be Muslim.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;m curious what the reaction of African or Asian nations would be if boatloads of ethnic Italians starting swarming ashore and settling in their countries.  I suspect those migrants would be told, in no uncertain terms, to get out immediately.  The problem with such a scenario is, of course, that nobody would choose to live in those hell holes.  Even the Africans and Asians themselves can&rsquo;t bare living amongst their own kind; they prefer the company of whites - or rather, the benefits of living amongst whites. </p>

			<p>What is this  &mdash;    &mdash;  some wild-eyed character with long, disheveled hair, girt in camel-skins, eating locusts and wild honey, recently come from some God-forsaken wilderness, pointing his accusing finger at the Men of the West, accusing us of sin?</p>
<p>No, it is the Catholic Church, with tutelage-minded men, fingernails neatly trimmed, balding heads groomed, wearing red robes, or other priestly vestments, shuffling about their priestly duties. </p>
<p>Nor is it just the Catholic Church; there are others. But Europe made you, O Mother Church, and now you are abandoning your children.</p>
<p>Read &#8220;The Camp of the Saints&#8221; by Jean Raspail. I finally broke down and ordered it (after 30 years!) and I am glad I did. I cannot recommend it highly enough. </p>
<p>When the New Renaissance comes, the Church, with its holy advice, &#8220;Let them multi-cult&#8221;, may meet the same fate as the other authority-figure who proposed that the starving minions all &#8220;eat cake.&#8221; </p>

<p>True. It&rsquo;s for the citizens of Western countries to decide, and they don&rsquo;t appear to want or need &#8216;multi-ethnicity&rsquo;. After all, importing Third World people from failed overpopulated societies has worked out so well for us, hasn&rsquo;t it? </p>

<p>Ah, the old Communist methods: either kill off the opposition en masse, or, if that option is foreclosed (or your opposition is the entire nation), inundate them with culturally alien foreigners.  For lessons in these techniques, <i>see</i> Ukraine, 1930s; Baltic Republics, 1950s; Tibet, 1990s, etc.</p>

<li>Nationalist parties are gaining strength throughout Europe and the Liberalism will inevitably be eradicated.</li>

			<p>Italian politics are an absolutely fascinating field for study in that in one single nation state exists the biggest (legitimate) communist party outside the former Eastern bloc,(which formerly dominated the industrial regions) combined with the right-wing &#8216;Christian Democrat&rsquo; party (a conservative party that used to maintain a majority of the Catholic agrarian vote base), and there is apretty strong base for the heirs of the Mussolini tradition of &#8216;corporatism&rsquo;.<br>
  Italy actually threatened to go communist in the 1950s - prompting much angst, no doubt, in the USA and amongst CIA operatives.Anyway, the Italian poltical system and the way it manages to contain the differing strands of diverse opinion (to say the very least), political parties who hate each other to the marrow, is endlessly fascinating.<br>
  Silvio Berlusconi swept a new broom through this strange. labyrinthine structure, but the point I wish to make after that little lecture is that the modern Italian left wing (the heirs of the communists), haven&rsquo;t gone away - they are as alive and virulent as ever and perhaps even more evil.&rsquo; &#8216;more evil&rsquo; is not the right word but &#8216;more stupid&rsquo; (if that is possible), is nearer the truth.They have embraced with a venegeance all the nuttier ideas of the American left and that particular core belief of the nutty American left - that nationality is irrelevant seems to form the core of their beliefs now that their ecnomic policies have bee totally discredited.</p>

			<p>Mazzini, a political philosopher from Genoa wrote an interesting book called &#8220;The duty&rsquo;s of man&#8221; in I think 1870. I&rsquo;ll have to re-read the book, it was a pleasure to read,..his general belief was in Nationalism, maintaining your national Identity by teaching it to the young. He believed each nation had a part to play in this ultimate Divine Drama, he believed in God but more philosophically, I think the book ended with a scathing vehemence for the Chatholic Church and predicting its demise. Without a living continuity to our past on genetic and cultural levels what are we but test tube people and cultures? This sterility of our Identity&rsquo;s is just what the losers of this world want,&hellip; behind the facade of all inclusiveness multi cult&hellip; is actually a forboding misery demanding company of the lost cains of this world. </p>

<p>We already know the answer to that: Native societies fought savagely against invasion by colonizing Europeans, from the Boxer Rebellion, to the Zulu to the American Indians.  These were healthy and reasonable responses to the genocide that massive immigration of foreigners represent.  If only Europeans had the same common sense of these once-invaded nations that have since repelled the Europeans and thrown off the yoke of colonialism.  </p>

<p>As an Italian I have always found foreign political system, especially the one in the US, absurdly simplistic. That your political debate has only 2 sides is almost unreal. How can you feel represented by that? Also, doesn&rsquo;t that bore you to death?</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
That is the story of the world. It has always been so. It happens among humans. It happens among animals and it happens among insects.  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need to point the finger at any particular group. Virtually all have been guilty at some point.  No tribe came with a deed from Adam guaranteeing them any particular part of the earth&rsquo;s surface.   One tribe has always encroached on the territory of another tribe&hellip; if it finds that it CAN, and if the other tribe ALLOWS it.  Even the Far northern Indians and the Eskimos have traditionally fought and been enemies. And the Indian tribes among themselves.  Everybody&rsquo;s seeking a chunk of the other guy&rsquo;s territory, his property, his females   &mdash;   if he can get away with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to us to hang onto what is our own; and if we&rsquo;re too weak or too stupid to do that, we&rsquo;ll lose it.  That&rsquo;s life.  The West has been softened up by Marxism and mushy-headed religion which both teach us that we&rsquo;re responsible for looking after everyone else in the world.  (Would those Somalis and such, if the wealth were reversed, look after us?)  The formerly invincible white man has become a pushover.  The Third World peoples see their chance, and they&rsquo;re taking it.</p>
