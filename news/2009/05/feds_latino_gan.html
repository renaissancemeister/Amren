<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Latino street gang waged a racist campaign to eliminate the city&rsquo;s black residents through attempted murders and other crimes, according to federal racketeering indictments unsealed Thursday.</p>
<p>Five indictments charged a total of 147 members and associates of the Varrio Hawaiian Gardens gang, and federal and local agencies arrested 63 of them by early Thursday, U.S. Attorney Thomas P. O&rsquo;Brien said at a news conference.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The indictments detail attempted murder, kidnapping, firearms, narcotics and other charges related to attacks by the gang, which is predominantly Latino and mainly operates in Hawaiian Gardens, a city of about 15,000 in southeastern Los Angeles County.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Shots fired into home</b></p>
<p>The indictment alleges a string of attacks on black residents, including a shooting into a home with eight people inside. The indictment does not say if anyone was hit.</p>
<p>In another instance, two gang members allegedly chased a black man, yelled a racist epithet at him and then beat him with a garden rake. The same man was later repeatedly stabbed by two gang members, according to the indictment, which charged them with his attempted murder.</p>
<p>According to 2000 census data, the latest available, Hawaiian Gardens was roughly 73 percent Hispanic and 4 percent black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The indictments mark at least the second time in less than two years that federal authorities have accused Latino gang members of attacking black residents because of their race. Local officials have tried to downplay racial tensions.<br>

						<p>
							<i>Scott Glover, Los Angeles Times, May 21, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Federal authorities today unveiled a sweeping racketeering indictment accusing a southern Los Angeles County street gang of a litany of crimes, including killing a sheriff&rsquo;s deputy and committing hate crimes against African Americans in order to rid them from their turf.</p>
<p>The indictment, along with several related ones, charges more than 100 members of the Varrio Hawaiian Gardens gang with murder, attempted murder, drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, extortion, kidnapping and witness intimidation. U.S. Atty. Thomas P. O&rsquo;Brien, speaking at a news conference this morning, touted it as the &#8220;largest gang takedown in United States history.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gang investigation began in 2005 after sheriff&rsquo;s Deputy Jerry Ortiz was fatally shot while conducting an interview in Hawaiian Gardens, a gritty, largely Latino city east of the 605 Freeway and north of Long Beach.</p>
<p>The shooter was a Varrio Hawaiian Gardens gang member with devils&rsquo; horns tattooed on his forehead. He has since been convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Authorities said the gang was formed in the 1950s or early &rsquo;60s and today has more than 1,000 members spanning several generations, many of them with connection to the Mexican Mafia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The indictment details several alleged attacks on African Americans, most of them shootings. In one incident, a gang member is accused of using a racial epithet against an African American, yelling at him to &#8220;get out of town&#8221; and then attacking him with a garden rake. {snip}</p>
<p>The gang members, with monikers such as &#8220;Slasher, Shady, Diablo and Menace,&#8221; boasted about being racist, referring to themselves as &#8220;The Hate Gang,&#8221; according to 193-page indictment that outlines the racketeering case. &#8220;VHG gang members have expressed a desire to rid the city of Hawaiian Gardens of all African Americans and have engaged in a systematic effort to achieve that result by perpetrating crimes&#8221; against them, the document states.</p>

			<p>My reaction initially was this:  How does the NAACP and the CBC love that comprehensive immigration reform now?</p>
<p>Even if the Hispanic gangs and others don&rsquo;t actually commit any formal hate crimes against blacks going forward, the net result will be the same:  Hispanics driving away blacks, just because.</p>
<p>These hate crimes will go down on the books as being committed by whites and against blacks.</p>

			<p>Drudge posted this today (or a similar article), but the mainstream media is ignoring it totally.  We white folks in fly-over country are large unaware of it.  </p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very hard for whites to grasp the depravity of non-whites unless they&rsquo;ve been in close quarters with it; it&rsquo;s like trying to describe combat to people who have never even held a weapon, much less heard a shot fired in anger.  My very gentile great-aunts never got over the shock of watching blacks chase each other with machetes through what was once a sleepy, placid white community.   Their eyes were opened that day.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Local officials have tried to downplay racial tensions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course they have&hellip;because it&rsquo;s blacks vs. hispanics. If it had been Whites vs. either of them it wouldn&rsquo;t be downplayed at all&hellip;Whites would be portrayed as the aggressors, no matter what the circumstance, and blacks or hispanics as the victims.</p>
<p>Remember, blacks did the same thing to Whites in the 60&rsquo;s, 70&rsquo;s, and 80&rsquo;s that hispanics are doing to them now. So, blacks, how does it feel now that it is happening to you? Ahhh, Karma in action&hellip;gotta love it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;A Latino street gang waged a racist campaign to eliminate the city&rsquo;s black residents through attempted murders and other crimes, according to federal racketeering indictments unsealed Thursday.&#8221;</p>
<p>So?  What&rsquo;s new about racial killings between mestizos and blacks?  The fighting and killings have been going on for years now.  They&rsquo;re just getting a bit more numerous.</p>
<p>And, they did leave out one big item of relevant news:  Blacks are perps in the racial conflict more so than the mestizos.  That&rsquo;s how it all began.  Blacks rarely verbalize their racist actions; yet there&rsquo;s not one single racial group they don&rsquo;t fight with.  Not one.</p>
<p>These RICO charges are going to be regarded as nothing more than a laughing matter by the gangs, mostly because they live in a weird world all their own, and they&rsquo;re not any brighter than the blacks.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the big shot prosecutor going to do when the situation degenerates into armed clashes?  These people regard him and his office as nothing more than a bozo patrol to be ridiculed.</p>

			<p>This is why I am not as worried about the Leviathan as I used to be.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m concerned, very.  But one would need more than a post to clearly state the difference between concerned and worried. </p>
<p>This topic is one of the things I posted about when I first started visiting this site, simply because I often found myself between Blacks and Hispanics at the workplace.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Let&rsquo;s All Unite Long Enough To Gang Up on the &#8220;REAL&#8221; Enemy&#8221; Alliance - which now has Political representation in the White House (it did before, but more indirectly) is simply not going to make it.  That doesn&rsquo;t mean we should drop our guard and wait for it to happen. But it&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>You have the Gays with the Muslims (an Alliance made, well, a little lower than Heaven) and you have the Feminists with the Mexicans and Muslims and their anti-women, let alone anti-feminist, cultures; you even have the NEVER EVER talked about, but easy to see if you have a front row seat, the very uneasy relationship between Gays and Lesbians; because, as one Gay friend once told me, when I asked him why this was so (pretending I didn&rsquo;t know)<br>
&#8220;We are, after all, Men!  And they don&rsquo;t like Men.  Besides, we get most the attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow, what an Army they would have, or no?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s picture it folks, shall we?  <br>
Gays and Lesbians in a Military that is top heavy with Mexicans and Muslims.  How do you think that&rsquo;ll work out.<br>
Lots and lots of Friendly Fire I would imagine. And, &#8220;target practice&#8221;?</p>
<p>WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!!!!!!!  <br>
Well, they weren&rsquo;t.  They are so blinded by their irrational hatred of White men, a hatred based almost entirely on exaggerations, misrepresentations, and projection, that they literaly can not think straight.</p>
<p>Good!</p>
<p>Like I said, I&rsquo;m concerned, but I&rsquo;m not worried.</p>

			<p>Following Dedalus&rsquo; comment, you don&rsquo;t need to look further than California to see the leviathan&rsquo;s internal divisions. Blacks turned out in higher than average numbers to elect &#8220;one of their own&#8221; but at the same time voted against gays in the state that was considered to be a gay/feminist stronghold.  The conflict between Blacks and Hispanics is simply going to become existential, especially in the southwest where water shortages both current and foretasted will stretch resources. The USA will look a lot like Brazil I imagine! How lovely!</p>

			<p>I attended both elementary and jr. high in Hawaiian Gardens (Barrio HG, as residents call it). Let me assure all AMREN readers, it was an anti-white hate center long before blacks arrived in any numbers. Of course we here know that some hatreds, like some peoples, are more equal than others. So I am sure no one is shocked by this bit of information.</p>
<p>P.S. I was amused to read the term &#8220;Varrio&#8221; used in this AP article. Though at the same time it is sickening to get a PC lecture from journalists who have clearly never before been near the place they write of.</p>

			<p>The irony of this story works on so many levels.<br>
For example, over the past 60 years the largely black-lead &#8216;civil-rights&rsquo; movement managed to deracinate and neuter all outward displays of White self-consciousness (the irony here is that White hostility to blacks was historically muted and strictly reactive), now that Whites in LA at least, have given up the ghost, blacks are forced to deal with a self-defined racial group taht not only fights for itself, but is pretty ruthless into the bargain!</p>

			<p>So when another race attacks blacks, it&rsquo;s racist and deserves media attention, but when there are far more (and regularly occuring) black on white crimes, that&rsquo;s not supposed to be talked about, muchless seen as racially-motivated crimes?  Okay&hellip;..</p>

			<p>So when were the mexicans going to &#8220;unite with blacks&#8221; against &#8216;da&rsquo; white man&rsquo;?  Seems with these black militants the revolution is in their head.  They are so blinded by hating whites, that the hispanics are screwing them over and the world is passing them by.</p>

			<p>A few thoughts&hellip;</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t surprising. If you have travelled extensively throughout Latin America you know that Latinos have no love of blacks at all. </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it kind of sweet to see blacks now getting a taste of their own medicine? Look at how many friendly, family-safe, White communities that have been destroyed by blacks.</p>

			<p>Let me get this straight: these will be counted as hate crimes perpetrated by &#8216;whites,&rsquo; correct?</p>
<p>And how is the same treatment of white people in Los Angeles by blacks not a hate crime?  </p>

Of course, as this spreads, it will be blamed on white Americas&rsquo; legacy of race. I also suspect that as it worsens, blacks will turn to whites for a solution. Whites will be seen as creating this problem and the key to finding workable solutions.</p>
<p>Two good things to come out of this is that it buys white people some time to see the problems diversity brings. Also, as long as blacks and browns are fighting each other, their ability to create a united front against whites is diminished. The black-brown coalition has and always will be a dream of blacks and a stepping stone over blacks for hispanics. Blacks still haven&rsquo;t figured out that hispanics aren&rsquo;t looking for a coalition; hispanics are co-opting the &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; ground work of blacks for their own power grab. And that power grab doesn&rsquo;t involve sharing power with blacks.</p>
<p>Black hatred for whites has left them blinded to what&rsquo;s going on around them.<br>

			<p>For any of you who think that Hispanics haven&rsquo;t done this to Whites - drove them out of &#8220;their neighborhoods&#8221; - it&rsquo;s largely already been done, although less overtly.  But it has been done violently.  Many Whites like myself left California because of experiences of being in close quarters with Hispanics.  My home burglarized twice and my office burglarized, ransacked and my business ruined.  I knew then of many situations were Whites had been raped, beat up, etc., etc., in my region of Northern California.  It took ten years and increasing problems to finally make me realize that living there was no longer good.  Now look at California.  I have also met many Whites in the Northwest who once lived in California and left for similar reasons.  I have to tell you, Hispanics have hurt my life directly and that of many other Whites I know, while I have not been personally hurt by any Black or even been personally threatened by one.  Combine that with the increasing size of the Hispanic world inside our borders and otherwise and you have the future of this country made clear.</p>

			<p>California Is over and done. Mexico has taken over the state,and the politicians help them do It. I was born and raised In the central valley,the whites have left for the most part,and what you have now Is a bunch of Illegals working under the table,and paying very little taxes. California will NEVER RECOVER without a serious crackdown on anchor babies,and the Illegal parents that drop them here.</p>

			<p>Tony Blair will most likely get the E.U. Pres seat. What you see in this article will blossom to all corners of white communities. the only way for the concerned is to buy yourself and family away from this mess. if you have money that is. these selfish battles will continue until they reach the communities we desire for folk. they are battling for the foundations that our forfathers had created. Drastically, the doors have been altruistically surrendered by the sorrow that are now in charge. whites have no kinship at the present time. I do not see no remedy for this dire complex. It would take an act of God to clean this up. To the white nulled, &#8220;kinship is important!&#8221;</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t either, but like millions of other white Americans who move out when blacks move in, we know full well how chaotic it is to live near them and we know what lousy attitudes they have, and, except for a witless liberal here and there, we know of their rude, trouble-making that&rsquo;s constantly in play, no matter where they are.   And anybody who reads the paper knows their contribution to crime is far more than any other group.</p>
<p>Regarding mestizos, every place I lived in close proximity to them it was necessary to take everything out of my vehicle and bring it in for the night or it would be gone overnight.  Too, any big items had to be tied down with the biggest chains available or they would be gone as well.  </p>
<p>If a person is inexperienced with mestizo theft of motorcycles, vehicles, bicycles, etc., he keeps buying bigger chains as his assets are depleted with bolt cutters, until he secures his belongings with a chain that looks like it belongs on an anchor for a battle ship.</p>
<p>Like the Indians when the settlers came to the US these Indians nowadays steal the white man blind.  There&rsquo;s been no change.  It must be an old family tradition.</p>
<p>Before the white man hit these shores their ancestors stole, tortured and killed each other from different tribes just as much as they did to the white man. </p>
<p>I guess once a pathology is so heavily ingrained in a people it&rsquo;s difficult to shake and act like decent human beings.</p>
<p>But of all the races, we&rsquo;re the unluckiest, because we have John McCain/Al Gore types who are so out of touch with the real world they believe these same people cry when they see the Statue of Liberty.</p>
<p>Can any people survive with such imbecillic leaders?  I think not, and we&rsquo;re in the process of proving that contention right now. </p>
<p>Anybody care to guess how long we have before we disintegrate?</p>

<p>Haha&hellip;yeah that appears to be very true. The vast majority don&rsquo;t like men, and they do not want include them in their social circles.</p>
<p>Compare that to gay men who often do want female friends and need the female energy in their life.</p>

			<p>Most Latino mestizos in the U.S. are, at least in the second generation still, more or less connected to Latin American culture, which has a European base and the elite in those countries are generally white or mostly white. As Carlos Fuentes, the Mexican philosopher wrote, the Mestizos and Mulattos maintain the culture and there is generally not a division - except in cases like Bolivia which is revindicating its Indian past with Evo Morales as the new president.</p>
<p>For this reason, while not wanting to idealize the Latinos living in the U.S. as compared with blacks, there is a similarity of culture between Hispanics and whites which is not the case as far as blacks. If you take prison life, for example, often the whites will ally with Hispanic prisoners to help avoid attacks by blacks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, whites sooner, rather than later, are going to have to start thinking like a minority group since their culture is the only one which is fair game for vilification and attack. Given the new percentages of minority groups for the upcoming generations in the U.S., this is not going to be a luxury but a necessity soon. In this sense, I am somewhat of a historical determinist and do not follow the line of thinking of many who post on this site and simply finish with some remark of desperation and hopelessness regarding the white racial situation and the future in store for us.</p>

			<p>It is good to distance oneself emotionally and not see this conflict as a &#8220;law and order&#8221; issue; I liked what Daedulus said. This is ethnic cleansing, not Yugoslav style but American style. Give this conflict 20 years and it will be something pretty fierce. I don&rsquo;t think the blacks will prevail, ever, in any conflict with the mex because the blacks have no concrete goals, whereas the mex have the territorial imperative. What blacks want is vague: power, solidarity, something or other. The mex simply want the turf. They want that because they feel it is theirs anyway; whether the turf becomes a substandard place is not their immediate concern. Blacks always seem to be striving to raise themselves up on someone else&rsquo;s bootstraps, if such a thing can be imagined.</p>

			<p>I think most people are more than a little cynical about politics, except maybe the incurably sentimental and naive.<br>
But I am surprised no one has mentioned the possibility that Obama was placed in the White House to serve as political cover for The Leviathan.  Perhaps someone has mentioned it, but I have yet to come across anyone, in flesh or in print, who has brought it up as a possiblity. <br>
I am refering to their displacement of Blacks.  </p>
<p>Here at AR we know the displacment of Whites is intentional; they&rsquo;re about two steps away from not even hiding it anymore (notice that you hear less and less lately about how Diversity is good for ALL of us and that Immigration helps the economy).  With us they are like a Murderer who has to play Con Man until they get close enough to their Victim.  If and When the Victim gets suspicious the Con Man responds with Denial (Sadly, at times, so too do some Victims).  Even to the point of making the Victim feel stupid and look bad for even questioning their motives.  Then, having got close enough to do the job, they fess up and say, &#8220;You were right in your original spot. <br>
I AM trying to kill you.&#8221;  <br>
That is what the Hate Speech Laws are about and that is what we&rsquo;re going to hear more of when they are in place (like the Murderer).<br>
But with Blacks it&rsquo;s less intentional and more like Collateral Damage.  But it is happening just the same.  And so, to cover it up, what better way than to &#8220;elect&#8221; a &#8220;Black&#8221; President.* <br>
It would appear as if most Blacks have fallen for this Hook, Line, and Sinker; while other Blacks are just plain, falling.</p>
<p>*I always thought it was so appropriate that Hulk Hogan was a big supporter of Obama.  Since the reality factor of your average Professional Wrestling Match, and last years Presidential Election had so much in common.<br>

			<p>Fight the Racists: The Leviathan is, in the Old Testament, a sea monster.  Sometimes it&rsquo;s now used to describe a whale.  In the 1600s, Thomas Hobbes wrote a book titled The Leviathan or something like that, about how humans need a powerful government to prevent a war of &#8220;all against all&#8221;.  Nowadays it refers to Big, Intrusive Government, like ours would be if they didn&rsquo;t have to staff it with non-White incompetents.  East Germany had a very efficient tyranny because they had nobody but Germans at the controls.  In a way, we&rsquo;re lucky that we have so much diversity in government.</p>

<p>Forgive me for saying this, but do you realize how wimpy that sounds? I have written so often and argued over and over with friends and family, that Americans get what we deserve, and man, are you making my point. Nothing personal, but this is the attitude that is going to sink European Americans in the nation their ancestors(a very different breed of people) built.</p>

			<p>To citizen who wrote that we can change things through massive registration of white voters etc.  A person would have to be pretty naive, at this point, to actually believe the system can be changed using its own rules.  &#8220;Massive education&#8221; yes &#8220;massive registration&#8221; no.  I don&rsquo;t care how many whites register to vote, 99% of whites are incredibly ignorant when it comes to racial matters.  They&rsquo;ll vote for whoever promises them the most loot.  They&rsquo;ll vote for whoever comes across as a &#8220;nice guy&#8221;.  They&rsquo;re ignorant and gullible and they prefer it that way.  Like lemmings, they&rsquo;ll walk over a cliff without a concern in the world.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not very likely in the USA to happen, at least not anytime soon.  Maybe in Europe or Australia will you see a much harder push for white nationalism looking at how open the groups are there as opposed to here.</p>

&#8220;I haven&rsquo;t either, but like millions of other white Americans who move out when blacks move in, we know full well how chaotic it is to live near them and we know what lousy attitudes they have, and, except for a witless liberal here and there, we know of their rude, trouble-making that&rsquo;s constantly in play, no matter where they are. And anybody who reads the paper knows their contribution to crime is far more than any other group.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thank you - you have made the exact conversational reply that I hoped for when I posted my comment.  Of course, I would not willingly move into a Black neighborhood, etc.  I suppose part of my point is that if Blacks were multiplying, immigrating at the same rate as Hispanics we would very soon be in a national crisis.  Or be in that national crisis far more quick than now.</p>

			<p>Thx 4 definition of leviathan.  Bobby criticizes another poster for sounding wimpy.  Yet Bobby says Americans deserve what they get.  No offense to Bobby but saying we deserve what we get is extremely wimpy.  He should stop saying it.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to put Bobby down.  I&rsquo;m glad he took the time to express his opinion here even though I don&rsquo;t agree with it.  We&rsquo;re all on the same side with the same goal, fighting the racists.</p>

			<p>If I were to judge from my own experiences as a Californian, I would say the &#8220;pecking&#8221; order goes along the following lines.</p>
<p>Latinos are the most overtly racist; Blacks follow second (at least their racism  &mdash;  -howsoever they argue that &#8220;blacks can&rsquo;t be racist&#8221; is more cleverly disguised); and Whites are the least racist.</p>
<p>However, so-called and real instances of White racism will definitely garner the attention of the mass media; of course, quite frequently, the main stream media never provides the complete story.</p>
<p>As far as neighborhood destruction:  Blacks will destroy a community quickly and completely.  The criminality is legendary.</p>
<p>I have a white dad and black mom, and even I know a fact is a fact when I see one.</p>
