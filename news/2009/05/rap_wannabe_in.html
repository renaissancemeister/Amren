<h1><a href="https://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2009/0511091cred1.html">Rap Wannabe in &#8220;Street Cred&#8221; Stickups</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Smoking Gun, May 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Meet Steven Gilmore. The wannabe rapper tried to rob a Florida convenience store Friday night and shot an employee in the head with a BB gun in a bid to establish &#8220;street cred&#8221; for his nascent hip-hop career. The 21-year-old Gilmore, seen in the below mug shot, admitted his harebrained scheme after he was arrested Saturday night, according to Gainesville police. Gilmore, who also copped to a stickup of the Hungry Howie&rsquo;s restaurant, told police that he thought the robberies would provide him the kind of reputation he apparently believes is required in the rap world. According to a Gainesville Police Department report, Gilmore, wearing a bandanna over his face and carrying a BB gun, fled empty-handed from the Super Store convenience outlet after struggling with a store clerk over the weapon. During the encounter, the clerk, Dharmedra Patel, was shot in the temple and suffered a laceration and bleeding. The Hungry Howie&rsquo;s heist netted Gilmore about $900, records show, and he departed the crime scene on a moped driven by a 16-year-old accomplice. The aspiring rap performer&rsquo;s career is now on hold as he faces attempted armed robbery and aggravated assault charges. He is currently being held in the Alachua County Jail on the felony counts</p>

			<p>Except that committing a crime just to build up &#8220;street cred&#8221; for rap (notice not for gangs) probably doesn&rsquo;t cut the mustard, because I think it&rsquo;ll be seen as contrived and fake.  Chump like, don&rsquo;t ya know? </p>
<p>The kind of crime that builds street cred is the kind of crime that would happen anyway without rap.</p>

I remember there was a Sopranos episode a lot like this.  Short synopsis from the web; </p>
<p>Tony spends time with rapper De Lux, also in for gunshot wounds. When aspiring rapper Marvin complains that now his album won&rsquo;t be produced by De Lux anytime soon, Bobby has a solution to help him gain cred: shooting him in &#8220;the fleshy part of the thigh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Season 6, Episode 4 -&#8220;Fleshy part of the thigh.&#8221;</p>
<p>That part made it a funny episode.  Who would have known it would kind actually transpire?  I mean, this stuff shows that black rap fans are actually impressed with a rapper&rsquo;s rap sheet.</p>

			<p>You can&rsquo;t make this stuff up! He stuck up a store with a BB gun and his &#8220;wheel man&#8221; was driving a moped! </p>

			<p>Poor guy. He couldn&rsquo;t even get a simple robbery right! What kind of black rapper is he, anyway?</p>
<p>But seriously, it&rsquo;s pretty sad that criminality is not only tolerated by much of the black community, it is actually expected and glorified! What does this say about blacks? Of course, the lefties assure us that it&rsquo;s all just due to &#8220;poverty.&#8221; Riiiiight&hellip;</p>

			<p>An aspiring rapper?  Looking at his photograph, I had him pegged as an aspiring Physicist.  His extraordinary intellect just oozes from the image, does it not?  It&rsquo;s obvious this guy is not taking advantage of his full potential.</p>

			<p>Yes, this is one of many youths of color who don&rsquo;t have any other future but crime, because of white racism and oppression.</p>
<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for that he would now be an important research scientist.</p>
<p>Er, if there any smarty pants who are ready to say he chose his life of crime all on his own, please be quiet.  This is &#8220;Let&rsquo;s pretend&#8221; time, and we&rsquo;re all supposed to gnash our teeth, wring our hands and blame whites, the system or whatever, for anybody he beats or kills.  Just keep in mind he&rsquo;s a victim.</p>
<p>When he goes to court, we&rsquo;ll have verification of that when his black mammy wails, &#8220;Muh boy&rsquo;s a good boy.  Ya&rsquo;ll jes racist.  Wait til we take over, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>No nation on earth can survive with such low quality people such as this.</p>

			<p>Criminy!  You just can&rsquo;t make this stuff up, but I suspect the appelation &#8220;aspiring rapper&#8221; is redundant, because it seems they&rsquo;re ALWAYS described that way.  Who in their right mind is an &#8220;aspiring rapper&#8221; anyway.  The term &#8220;aspiring murder victim&#8221; is equally accurate, given what tends to happen to those guys: Tupac Shakur, etc.</p>

<p>Let me guess, the clerk is an immigrant! the crime couldn&rsquo;t have happened if he/she wasn&rsquo;t in this country. </p>

<p>I remember a story from a year ago or so.  Another such &#8220;aspiring rapper&#8221; was committing armed robbery in a Subway (I think it was in Florida).  Actually, he was about to commit multiple homicide - he had started herding everyone in the shop into a back room, and we all know what that was leading to.  Fortunately, one of the patrons, a true citizen-hero, was armed and shot the fiend dead.</p>
<p>Another &#8220;Expiring Rapper&#8221;.</p>

			<p>We got held up at Subway, too, back in August 2004 (I took the job just to keep my probation officer happy.)  We also got marched to the back office, but we lucked out - the robber only wanted the reserve of ones and fives for the register.  Yes, you guessed it: another &#8220;aspiring rapper&#8221;!</p>
<p>Apparently, he had driven from Albequerque to Denver and back, robbing fast food restaurants both ways.  He&rsquo;s doing seven years in New Mexico, and when he gets done with that, he&rsquo;ll do more time in Colorado.  The dingbat got less than $500 from us.  In Colorado, the threshold for felony theft is $500, so if our &#8220;aspiring rapper&#8221; had merely STOLEN that much, it would have been a misdemeanor.  Armed robbery, though is instantly a felony even if you don&rsquo;t get any money at all.</p>
<p>It appears that one of the prerequisites for being an &#8220;aspiring rapper&#8221; is that one must be as dumb as a post.</p>
