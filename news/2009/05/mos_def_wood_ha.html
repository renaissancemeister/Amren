			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Liz "Red" Thomas, Baller Status, April 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Actors Mos Def and Wood Harris recently revealed that they banned the use of the dreaded &#8220;N&#8221; word while on the set, as well as within, their upcoming film &#8220;Next Day Air.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a recent interview with Rolling Out, Harris explained their decision, while detailing how they stuck to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was something that was very important to us. It was our way of making a statement that we can express ourselves without using the &#8216;N&rsquo; word,&#8221; Harris explained. &#8220;But it wasn&rsquo;t just in the movie that we banned the word. We also banned it on the set. No one could say it at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first it was difficult, but we really stayed on top of each other,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;By the end of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. filming, I don&rsquo;t know if it was something that even came up. We just didn&rsquo;t say it, and had no desire to. I hope that other people will start trying to find new ways to express themselves as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Benny Boom directed film revolves around the story of ten people, who are effected by the decision of two criminals who mistakenly receive a package, via courier, stuffed with kilos of grade-a cocaine.</p>

			<p>Saw the trailer to this movie. I think they banned Whites from the production. Never see the reverse &#8220;All White Movie&#8221; coming out of Hollywood.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It was our way of making a statement&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>My goodness, how pretentious and corny. </p>
<p>Mos Def.  Wasn&rsquo;t he the guy in The Italian Job remake?</p>
<p>I watched that with my South American girlfriend (keep in mind she is from a place that is only now getting wind of Political Correctness, and given the demography, in very small doses; so talk on Race there is refreshingly direct, even a bit naive and innocent). </p>
<p>In any event, his character in the movie was supposed to be a cultured bookworm who wanted to use part of his money to build a private library filled with &#8220;first editions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The look of sweet, innocent confusion, on my girlfriends face, the look of sheer puzzlement, was absolutely priceless, and unforgettable.  </p>

<i>&ldquo;At first it was difficult, but we really stayed on top of each other&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>As with diversity, tolerance, inclusion and every PC buzz word, blacks not using &#8216;the word&rsquo; is unnatural. It takes conscious effort, personal vigilance, and self-control.</p>
<p>So they achieved this during the production of this film.</p>
<p>How does this then translate in post-production real life? Does this commitment only apply to this film or the rest of their personal and professional lives? Will this unnatural, conscious effort, and hyper personal vigilance be carried on in their daily lives? Will they personally abstain and admonish bothers and sisters to watch their words now and forever?</p>
<p>Hardly. As with any unnatural act of self-control, it can&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>The real test will be each and every film and rap song they participate in from now on. Personally, I believe they set themselves up for failure. Will they be held accountable in the future? No.</p>

<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s rich.  How does one make intellectuals out of rappers?  Why, simply show them as such.  Truly, we live in an age of brass.</p>
<p>Mr. Def, if I may call him that, also believes in causes.  Here he is calling for a national school boycott in support of the &#8220;Jena 6&#8221;:</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s a movie about cocaine, but they&rsquo;re not using the n-word. I&rsquo;m so impressed.</p>
