			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lesley Ciarula Taylor, Toronto Star, May 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Poised, articulate, educated and confident, Kirunda, a black woman, can dissect and analyze why Canadians treat her differently.</p>
<p>But all bets were off when schoolmates called her 10-year-old son Sean a n  &mdash;    &mdash;  -. Three times. Three different children.</p>
<p>&#8220;I anticipated this would happen, but it breaks my heart. Something is wrong when children say these things. On top of everything, I&rsquo;m not going to have my child degraded,&#8221; said the Mississauga resident.</p>
<p>The &#8220;everything&#8221; she refers to includes being sent to an Adult Learning Centre when she arrived, even though English is her first language, and getting passed over for a college spot in favour of a white friend. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve never understood people who believe they are more superior. It&rsquo;s based in idiotic ideologies. And it&rsquo;s not just white European people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirunda and her son, Canadian citizens who emigrated from Kenya six years ago, face exactly the sort of walls a major study of multiculturalism and society pinpoints.</p>
<p>Crunching thousands of numbers from 41,666 people interviewed in nine languages, the just-published study found skin colour  &mdash;  not religion, not income  &mdash;  was the biggest barrier to immigrants feeling they belonged here. And the darker the skin, the greater the alienation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were surprised that religion didn&rsquo;t have more effect,&#8221; said lead author Jeffrey Reitz. &#8220;It came down to race, with Asian people reporting some and with young black males the most stigmatized. The data is consistent with that.</p>
<p>&#8220;We tend to believe racism is a minor problem in Canada, of little consequence. Someone looked at them funny. Or that many immigrants are doing well, so it must be their fault if they aren&rsquo;t. There is a reluctance to investigate the issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>The University of Toronto professor of ethnic, immigration and pluralism studies added that a lack of trust was also higher among the successful, Canadian-born, Canadian-educated children of visible minority immigrants.</p>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t multiculturalism, spawned in 1971 by then-prime minister Pierre Trudeau, the study concluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people in Canada revel in diversity. They were happy to say goodbye to liver and onions, hello stir-fries and samosas,&#8221; said Reitz. But the original idea of multiculturalism saw integration as the marker of success: A second generation equally accepted in the mainstream and in the ethnic community.</p>
<p>The study found:</p>
<p>The more discrimination someone faced, the more they were likely to identify with their ethnic group, rather than as Canadian.</p>
<p>Visible minorities identified themselves much more strongly by their ethnic origin through the second, third and fourth generations.</p>
<p>While 65 per cent of recent black immigrants, 70 per cent of South Asians and 52 per cent of Chinese felt they belonged in Canada, those numbers dropped to 37 per cent, 50 per cent and 44 per cent in the second generation.</p>
<p>A third of Chinese, South Asians, Filipino and Southeast Asians reported discrimination; half of blacks did and 40 per cent of Koreans and Japanese did. In fact, a schoolyard fight in Keswick that made national news involved a Korean boy retaliating for a racial slur.</p>
<p>Discrimination was most common in applying for jobs and at work; a store, bank or restaurant were the next most frequent.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to address these feelings of isolation,&#8221; said Reitz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Among minorities born in Canada, blacks have the lowest sense of belonging, the lowest level of trust in others and the weakest sense of Canadian identity. They are the least likely to vote,&#8221; Reitz and Ryerson University assistant professor Rupa Banerjee wrote in the book Multiculturalism and Social Cohesion. &#8220;Among recent immigrants, blacks have high levels of volunteers but among the second generation this has disappeared.&#8221;</p>
<p>Should we worry?</p>
<p>Reitz pointed out that the first wave of migration of blacks from the south in the United States were embraced for their culture and differences in the north, creating places such as the prosperous, dynamic Harlem in New York City.</p>
<p>A few generations later, Harlem was a ghetto that exploded into race riots.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not saying that is going to happen here. But we have indications of social problems in communities. There is the perception of a crime problem. Some children of immigrants have high dropout rates. We ought to be asking why.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study used data from Statistics Canada&rsquo;s 2002 Ethnic Diversity Survey. In the last seven years, said Reitz, &#8220;attitudes have improved in race relations. But they aren&rsquo;t reflected in reduced discrimination. Better is not good enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirunda, a registered nurse who is taking graduate nursing courses at Ryerson University, would agree.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m a single black mum with a black boy. In Canada, there is more compassion for that than in the States. Here, I knew I was going to be supported.&#8221; She pauses. &#8220;If I did most of the hard work.&#8221;<br>

			<p>&#8220;Reitz pointed out that the first wave of migration of blacks from the south in the United States were embraced for their culture and differences in the north, creating places such as the prosperous, dynamic Harlem in New York City.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>This first wave of Southern blacks into the North began in 1915 as Southern Blacks fled poverty and tightening Jim Crow restrictions for the relative freedom and prosperity of the North.</p>
<p>They quickly swamped the native Northern Blacks, who by this point had been free in some cases for more than a century and a half. (Native Northern Blacks first began to move to Harlem around 1905). A mostly illiterate peasant people, unsuited for life in a modern industrial urban environment, they were forced into a handful of crowded urban slums. Harlem, a majority white middle class area suffering from an oversupply of housing in 1910, quickly became an overcrowded slum, overwhelmingly black by the &rsquo;20s.</p>
<p>Social, economic, and racial tensions brought by this wave of unwanted and uninvited Southern blacks caused numerous violent race riots to break out in many Northern cities in 1919.</p>
<p>In the &rsquo;20s, during Prohibition, Harlem clubs and speakeasies did draw White tourists to sample this new &#8220;diversity&#8221; (these clubs and bars were frequently segregated, only White customers allowed), and Black music and literature did draw an increasing number of White fans, but, generally, this influx of Blacks was lamented and ignored as much as possible.</p>
<p>Black Harlem was &#8220;a ghetto that exploded into race riots&#8221; for the first time in 1935, hardly &#8220;generations&#8221; after Blacks first began to displace Whites there. </p>
<p>But why let reality intrude on a pleasant multiculti tall tale!</p>
<p>(And why do we not hear the opinions of indigenous White Canadians on their accelerating displacement by this ever-enriching diversity?)</p>

<p>So&hellip;is he admitting that what naive white Canadians believed was &#8220;diversity&#8221; (a wider food palette), and what the anti-white social engineers believed was &#8220;diversity&#8221; (the slow devolution of a white majority to a &#8220;melting-pot&#8221; minority), are two entirely different concepts?</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t EVER recall that Harlem was a prosperous neighborhood, after blacks displaced the original inhabitants. As far as I can remember, Harlem was a dirty, filthy, crime-infested slum populated by black people, who kept re-electing the infamous crooked minister, Adam Clayton Powell to the U.S. Congress. Leave it to a Canadian to think Harlem, NY was a prosperous black neighborhood. Maybe he compared Harlem to some place like Gonaives, Haiti.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never understood people who believe they are more superior. It&rsquo;s based in idiotic ideologies. And it&rsquo;s not just white European people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its not a belief, its fact. Show me where non-Western countries have flourished and produced all that America/Western Europe has. All other countries finally wake up to material need and pursue it American/Western European style (hello, we did invent and perfect representative government, capitalism and the idea of individuality). No other civilization has done more for human kind to advance political, religious, and material gains than that of America/Western Europe. This even includes you ancient civilizations in China and India.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more discrimination someone faced, the more they were likely to identify with their ethnic group, rather than as Canadian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yep, and you should, too. If you entered the west, probably to enjoy any of the three improvements to humanity stated above, you should honor that civilization and integrate into it. If doing it the way you did in your country was so successful, than why leave for the West? The more ethnic you act in the West, the more you are discriminated against for your non-conformity to the West.</p>
<p>The ethnic food and festivities can stay, the ethnic &#8216;way&rsquo; of life can stay in the countries they are found in.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s another wonderful example of the diversity of Canada.</p>
<p>Thursday, May 14, 2009<br>
 <br>
A former researcher at the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg is facing charges in the United States after allegedly trying to smuggle genetic material from the Ebola virus across the Manitoba-North Dakota border. </p>
<p>CBC News reports:</p>
<p>U.S. authorities allege Konan Michel Yao had 22 vials of the substance in the trunk of his car when he tried to cross the border on May 5. He is charged with smuggling merchandise, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 US.</p>
<p>U.S. customs officers allegedly found the vials wrapped in aluminum foil inside a glove and packaged in a plastic bag, along with electrical wires.</p>
<p>In his affidavit, the 42-year-old researcher said he was hired by the Public Health Agency of Canada to work as a PhD fellow at the Winnipeg facility. Yao told officers he was working on a vaccine for the Ebola virus and HIV.</p>
<p>On Jan. 21, his last day at the lab, he said he stole 22 vials, which he described as research vectors, according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>Yao told officers he was taking the vials to his new job with the National Institutes of Health at the Biodefense Research Laboratory in Bethesda, Md., because he didn&rsquo;t want to start from scratch in his research.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank Plummer, the scientific director of the Winnipeg lab, said the genetic material taken was not the full Ebola virus and does not pose a risk to the public.</p>
<p>Plummer said theft has never happened at the lab before. Researchers are reminded they cannot take any lab property without permission, and they sign documents asserting that they know the rules, he said.</p>
<p>The lab is now reviewing its biosecurity protocol.<br>

<p>This is a chicken-or-egg problem.  On the one hand, you can say that facing discrimination leads to ethnic identification.  But what if it&rsquo;s the other way around?  What if your ethnic identification made you more sensitive to (or paranoid about) &#8220;discrimination,&#8221; in that you interpreted slights and events as &#8220;discrimination&#8221; when others would not?</p>

			<p>How many reports and studies must be made about the problems that multi-culturalism causes until the leftist finally admit that multi-culturalism does not work? Will they ever admit it? It&rsquo;s doubtful. Obviously the problem is that we are not multi-cultural enough. Once all the Western nations are full of people from every single nation on the globe then it will finally work. Clearly that&rsquo;s their goal.</p>

			<p>From Kenya to Canada and the main thing she feels is discrimination. Not one word of gratitude for the miracle of being allowed into a first world nation and the incomparable improvement in her and her child&rsquo;s standard of living just by dint of being in Canada.<br>
Whatever happened to the love of immigrants for America and Canada? </p>

			<p>The white political class in Canada, Europe and the US is incredibly self-destructive.  However, the dark immigrants, if they are so wonderful, should have stayed in their own homelands and tried to clean them up.  Instead they come to a western country where the dirty work of building a civilized society has been done for them and then whine because someone doesn&rsquo;t like them.  Until third worlders are forced to stay home they will have no incentive to build their own societies.  They will just come and mess up ours.<br>

<p>Here is a hint Kirunda, how about returning to Kenya, then no problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying that(ghettos) is going to happen here.</p>
<p>Of course it will. Wherever you have black communities, you have crime, dysfunction, destruction etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reitz pointed out that the first wave of migration of blacks from the south in the United States were embraced for their culture and differences in the north,&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense. Blacks moved north and created ghettos and crime and the north didn&rsquo;t like it one bit.</p>

<p>Yes, how dare she have to work hard, she should just have it handed to her. Also, this woman obviously knows nothing about the USA which is not less &#8220;compassionate&#8221; (read givng handouts). Single black moms with kids have the US government bending over backwards for them. Here in the US, we just have lot more Kirundas then Canada does draining us.<br>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s translate-</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirunda, a registered nurse who is taking graduate nursing courses at Ryerson University&#8221;</p>
<p>At Canadian taxpayer expense.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a single black mum with a black boy. In Canada, there is more compassion for that than in the States.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Canada, I feel there are even more handouts for me than in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, I knew I was going to be supported.&rdquo; She pauses. &ldquo;If I did most of the hard work.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here I knew I was going to get lots of handouts&hellip; she pauses but I have to work really hard, didn&rsquo;t expect that and don&rsquo;t like it, just thought it would be handed to me.</p>
<p>Really, why should someone have any more compassion for a single black mom than anyone else. Ok, so she&rsquo;s black, she didn&rsquo;t use birth control and she had a baby with an irresponsible fellow african sperm donor. Why should she get more help than a responsible married white man or woman with kids struggling to get by or a white divorcee or widow and there are plenty of those. She made her choices and deserves no more compassion or handouts than anyone else.</p>

			<p>There were extremely few non-Whites in Canada before the late 1960&rsquo;s. This was all Trudeau&rsquo;s doing. I am old enough (sigh) to remember going about my business all over Toronto and spending WEEKS, even MONTHS without laying eyes on one single non-White. I would point out for the benefit of AmRen&rsquo;s non-Canadian readers that the Toronto Star is an extremely left-wing, ultra socialist, die-hard Liberal newspaper. And oh yes, they just LOVED Trudeau.</p>

			<p>Why does the entire western world send nurses, physicians and other medical missionaries to Kenya and Kenya exports its own nurses?</p>
<p>According to vdare.com, there are more Ethopian physicians in Chicago than there are in  Ethopia.  That&rsquo;s just the city of Chicago, not the metro area.</p>
<p>Send her back home where she can nurse her own people.  Give the job to a real Canadien </p>

			<p>Among the various Egyptian monuments there is an inscription on a large stele erected by some pharaoh (I think his name was Sesostris, he lived around 1870 B.C.), on which he forbids Nubians (blacks) to ascend Nile, and states the Egyptian opinion of them: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Nubians cower before mere words, and one has only to challenge them to make them retreat; if one attacks them, they run. But if one draws back, they become aggressive. They are not a race worth consideration. They are degraded creatures and cowardly.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Canada had only a few thousand blacks in 1970, mostly in communities in Halifax and Montreal.  Most Canadians only encountered blacks if they road the train, because blacks were very respected porters.</p>
<p>The greed of Prime Minister Mulroney in the 1980&rsquo;s was responsible for pushing immigration to a quarter million foreigners per year, and that number has been sacred doctrine ever since.  China, India, Pakistan, Africa and the Caribbean have been the most numerous source regions.</p>
<p>Africans living in Canada now number between 750,000 and one million.  Many naive Canadians are just beginning to realize that all blacks aren&rsquo;t like Bill Cosby or Nelson Mandela.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Among minorities born in Canada, blacks have the lowest sense of belonging, the lowest level of trust in others and the weakest sense of Canadian identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps this is because Africans don&rsquo;t belong in Canada at all. Why should a black African develop a &#8216;Canadian identity&rsquo; in the first place? How do Africans &#8216;belong&rsquo; in a country created by Europeans whose descendents adhere to European morality and law? Perhaps this is why Canada is a successful wealthy country and Africa is a hellhole. </p>

The WHITE MAN created Harlem. And to this day, the WHITE MAN is the ONLY one responsible for any prosperity that may take place there. And since when has trashy, crime ridden black neighborhoods been considered &#8220;dynamic&#8221;? </p>

			<p>Maybe Kirunda! will become president (or whatever) of Canada with such esteemed heritage as Kenyan.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a single black mum with a black boy. In Canada, there is more compassion for that than in the States. Here, I knew I was going to be supported.&rdquo; She pauses. &ldquo;If I did most of the hard work.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>How dare you have to work hard and take care of yourself!  It&rsquo;s not like poor, single white mothers don&rsquo;t have to struggle, right?  I guess giving you free handouts and feeling sorry for you is compassion.  I guess us Americans are &#8216;mean&rsquo; for expecting others to make it on their own without the help of government.<br>

			<p>&#8220;The more ethnic you act in the West, the more you are discriminated against for your non-conformity to the West.&#8221;</p>
<p>Someone hasn&rsquo;t been to a university in awhile. About like 60 years. Even white folks are rewarded for non-conformity to the West - military industrial complex, imperialism, expansionism, colonialism, corporate oligopoly, patriarchy, racism, rampant government experiments, materialism, invasions of privacy, patriotism, nationalism, military protectionism, moral backwardness, and just plain old sin and evil.</p>
<p>A nice introductory course at a state school could clear you up on that.  <br>

			<p>How many times have we heard this story?</p>
<p>Blacks leaving their schools, neighborhoods, countries and moving to white schools, neighborhoods, countries etc.</p>
<p>Once there they complain about how they are treated. The blacks don&rsquo;t want to leave the white areas mind you they just want to complain.</p>

			<p>It looks like she understands how to work the system: use the right buzz words: &#8220;immigrant&#8221;, &#8220;unwed mother&#8221;, &#8220;victim of racism&#8221;, &#8220;blah blah&#8221;.</p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;A lot of people in Canada revel in diversity. They were happy to say goodbye to liver and onions, hello stir-fries and samosas,&rdquo;</i> said Reitz.</p>
<p>Wrong!  The only people that &#8220;revel in diversity&#8221; are those whose jobs depend on promoting the nation-destroying product of <i>multiculturalism</i>. Just under the thin veneer of <i>real</i> Canadians, you&rsquo;ll find varying degrees of doubt (finally!) of just where our country is headed. Nobody consulted with ordinary taxpaying Canadians in whether we needed to change our entire racial monocultural structure to suit somebody else&rsquo;s utopian dream. </p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Canada had only a few thousand blacks in 1970&hellip;.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>This is true, but unfortunately somebody left the floodgates open allowing masses of third-world victimology groups to pour into a homogeneous country that was once comprised of a 97% White population in those days.  </p>

			<p>I travel around the Toronto area frequently and I am utterly amazed at how rapid the entire area (suburbs included) has changed.  Even areas that have up until recently been predominately European have begun to change rapidly into shades of brown, black and yellow.  </p>
