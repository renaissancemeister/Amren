<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-beverlycenter19-2009may19,0,2507826,full.story">Rapper Dolla Is Shot, Killed at Beverly Center</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Quinones, Rong-Gong Lin II, and Andrew Blankstein, Los Angeles Times, May 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Atlanta-based rapper was fatally shot in the valet waiting area of the Beverly Center mall Monday by a suspect who fled in a silver Mercedes SUV, according to police. Officers later detained a &#8220;person of interest&#8221; as he approached the ticketing area at Los Angeles International Airport armed with a gun.</p>
<p>The shooting occurred about 3:10 p.m. in the parking garage of the popular Westside mall, sending diners in nearby restaurants diving for cover.</p>
<p>Dolla, a rapper whose real name is Roderick Anthony Burton II, was shot in the head as he and several other people stood near the center&rsquo;s La Cienega Boulevard entrance, according to police, witnesses and Dolla&rsquo;s publicist, Sue Vannasing. A friend of the rapper&rsquo;s who was at the Beverly Center and a Los Angeles Police Department official also confirmed the victim&rsquo;s identity to The Times.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The LAPD has not announced a motive for the attack or identified any suspects. Detectives are questioning a woman they detained at the scene and a man who allegedly drove from the mall to LAX in a rented silver Mercedes SUV.</p>
<p>About an hour after the shooting, the LAPD issued a bulletin for a 20-year-old man considered a &#8220;person of interest&#8221; in the shooting. Los Angeles Airport Police officers spotted a man fitting the description in the ticketing lobby of Terminal 1.</p>
<p>&#8220;The suspect was detained without incident [and] discovered to be armed,&#8221; said Los Angeles World Airports spokeswoman Nancy Castles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The killing comes 12 years after another shooting in Los Angeles threw the rap music business into turmoil. In that case, the rapper Notorious B.I.G. was shot to death outside the Petersen Automotive Museum, about two miles from the scene of Monday&rsquo;s killing. Theories over the motivation for that killing have caused controversy ever since.</p>

Another dead rapper I never heard of.</p>
<p>While I know there have been feuds in rock-n-roll between individuals and I recall hearing bands wrecking hotel rooms or shooting a tv, I don&rsquo;t recall any level of violence in RnR comparable to what goes on with rap.</p>
<p>At least he&rsquo;s got his street cred.<br>

Guess you could say that this unlucky young brotha was &#8220;a day late and a Dolla short.&#8221; </p>
<p>But seriously, folks, I&rsquo;ve shopped at the Beverly Center. Being an upscale mall on the west side, it&rsquo;s one of LA&rsquo;s last bastions of retail civility where the dwindling white SoCal population can get away from mestizos families waddling along hand-in-hand, ten abreast, at least for a couple of hours. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough to have these moronic hip-hop shootings occurring in Darktown (south of the 10 Freeway), but if they&rsquo;re gonna start doing it in the 310 area code too, then every caucasian in LA who doesn&rsquo;t absolutely NEED to live there is gonna join the White Flight and just LEAVE. </p>

			<p>Never heard of this kid so I checked youtube for videos and wicki for info.  Absorbed in the rap culture to the bone.  To bad.</p>
<p>But I was right.  &#8220;Dolla&#8221; is half-black, half-Puerto Rican. </p>

			<p>FYI, a White rocker, Bobby Fuller, of the Bobby Fuller Four was murdered in L.A. about 1966.  Supposedly a drug deal gone awry.  His big hit was &#8220;I Fought the Law (and the law won)&#8221;.  Life imitates art.  </p>

Your point is well taken.  I&rsquo;ve said this before, but I believe it is worth repeating.  I think the reason Rap music and black culture is so popular amongst white kids is that most young white kids are in a racial identity crisis.  </p>
<p>Whites are taught from a very young age that their history is evil and laced with horrible atrocities while minority cultures are celebrated.  People general want to identify with a group and black culture is the most promoted by schools and the media while then own ancestry is shunned.  Until kids are taught to take pride in their heritage, things are never going to change.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Aspiring rapper&#8221; seems to be the new media code words that they now use instead of &#8220;he was a good boy, an honor roll student, and an outstanding &#8216;afawete&rsquo; who just happened to fall in with the wrong crowd.&#8221;  I think the media stopped with that canard when too many people realized that it was nonsensical for everyone in the wrong crowd just happening to fall in with the wrong crowd (who, then, was the wrong crowd?), and too many stories about grade and course title inflation in &#8220;minority&#8221; schools convinced enough people that being an &#8220;honor roll student&#8221; in a black school meant that you showed up to schools more days than not.</p>
<p>Now the media use &#8220;aspiring rappers,&#8221; not being mindful of the egalitarian drivel they push.  It won&rsquo;t be too long until one of us brainless schmucks asks the obvious question   &mdash;   of the black boys or men that get murdered, why are they all &#8220;aspiring rappers?&#8221;  Why no aspiring chemical engineers, or aspiring neurosurgeons, or aspiring stockbrokers?  If everyone&rsquo;s equal, lame media, then there should be some of those that become chalk outlines.  Also, aren&rsquo;t any of these murder victims actually doing something rather than &#8220;aspiring&#8221; to do something?  Eating your mother&rsquo;s food stamp-acquired food isn&rsquo;t a profession, though.  My bad.</p>

			<p>Use a certain popular internet search engine whose name starts with &#8220;G&#8221; and enter &#8220;aspiring rapper&#8221; into its search box.  The results will always involve robbing, killing, or getting killed.</p>

<p>You are so right.  Here&rsquo;s an email I got regarding advertising for a children&rsquo;s museum.</p>
<p>I&#8221;n Seattle there is the Pacific Science Center in the old 1960<br>
world&rsquo;s fair area (now called the Seattle Center). The advertising for the PSC one year was billboards all across town showing kids in a roller coaster wagon. The front rows were all Blacks and the back row had a European-American boy and girl. The boys face was obscured by a Black fist. </p>
<p>Different versions of the same photo shot appeared in ads<br>
in magazines: although the angle from which the pictures were taken was different in each instance, in every one the black fist overlaid the European-American boys&rsquo; face. The fist was carefully posed in each photo to be in front of the European-American boy&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>The next year, or so, the ad campaign had a photo of kids at one of their science camps. A line of blonde girls were following the<br>
leader: a dark Mexican. The last person in the line was a European-American boy. You could tell than from his arms, which were raised. But his head was covered by a bag!!!.</p>
<p>Pacific Science Center itself (which is pretty good) rams home its multicultural message with the large photos of children that decorate the facilities exhibit halls: Every single one on my last visit was of Blacks, Mexicans, Asians </p>
<p>Of the children visiting the Pacific Science Center, 99% plus are<br>
European-Americans.</p>
