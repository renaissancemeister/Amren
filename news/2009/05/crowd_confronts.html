<h1><a href="http://pressherald.mainetoday.com/story.php?id=255867&amp;ac=PHnws">Crowd Confronts Police Making Shoplifting Arrest</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Portland (Maine) Press Herald, May 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police responded to a report that a man had stolen two bottles of vodka at 7 p.m. Friday at the Hannaford on Forest Avenue.</p>
<p>Workers at the store provided a description of the suspect and the car he left in, and police pulled the car over at Franklin Arterial and Fox Street a couple of minutes later, police said.</p>
<p>As police were arresting Jimmy Odong, 19, of Portland and recovering the stolen merchandise, a group of about 15 to 30 people gathered, with about 10 of them becoming aggressive toward police, officers said.</p>
<p>A number of other officers were dispatched to the area, which is alongside the Kennedy Park housing development. Members of the gathering group, some of whom are Sudanese, like Odong, and some who are from other African countries, began calling the officers names, including &#8220;killers&#8221; and &#8220;murderers,&#8221; in apparent reference to the police shooting of a Sudanese immigrant, David Okot, last month.</p>
<p>When police prepared to tow the car Odong had driven, some of the crowd jumped on the car to try to prevent it from being taken, police said.</p>
<p>Three juveniles eventually were arrested, two of them on charges of assault after they allegedly punched the officers, police said.</p>
<p>Police also charged Yannick Mulongo, 21, of Clark Street with unlawful interference with a law enforcement dog, after he allegedly taunted a police dog named Taz; and Sara Langoia, 18, of Anderson Street with obstructing government administration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The shift commander reported that additional arrests were warranted, but officers opted not to arrest others so the confrontation would not escalate.</p>

			<p>Blacks always stick up for black criminals. In my area, a much loved middle school teacher was recently killed by a single punch for coming to the aid of white women being harassed by a gang of blacks outside a club, yet the next day on the news one girl from the black community said it was just &#8220;a fight&#8221; and the &#8220;white man was talking junk&#8221;. This was in Kenosha, WI.</p>

			<p>Ah the joys of diversity!,look for these situations to occur all over the U.S.,starting in city areas,and spreading to the suburbs,Somali-Bantus are all over the country with many more on the way,Africa will dump as many &#8220;citizens&#8221;on us as possible,and that will be followed by a staggering amount of mexicans,and as many non-whites that can squeeze into the country to steal our benefits,and destroy our infrastructure,don&rsquo;t forget folks,they come here with a grudge against Whites!</p>
<p>Want to complain White man?,hate speech legislation is being prepared for you as this is written,want to protect your family?,back door firearm restrictions and firearm confiscation will render you helpless!anyone here starting to see our South African future?</p>

			<p>Should be more than just assault charges.  This sounds to me like obstruction of justice, or interference with law enforcement, or something like that.  Throw in some inchoate charges relating to gang activity, see if there are any links between this mob and AQ, and boom!  A really mad piper to pay.</p>

			<p> Situations like this must serve as a warning to the future of white Mainers if non-whites increase their numeric foothold within the state. By not arresting those who expressed their tribalism upon the police emboldens them. </p>
<p>On a positive note, the state is more than ninty- six percent white and its small cities still remain fairly civil; its non-white population little more than token.</p>
<p>Northern american blacks and africans are highly urbanized so the racial demographic distribution of Maine won&rsquo;t realy change. <br>
Since Maine is largely rural, cold and historically white, non- urban areas will continue to be so. Many blacks consider cold rural regions no-go zones anyway.</p>

			<p> It&rsquo;s good to see that the officers didn&rsquo;t tolerate the interference with their performing of their duties by these thugs. But they made one mistake: Refraining from making further arrests, supposedly to &#8220;keep the confrontation from escalating.&#8221;</p>
<p> The way to deal with aggressive mobs is to bust as many chops as possible. Make them see that causing that kind of trouble is not going to be just a big &#8220;lark&#8221; and a chance to give the police a hard time. The knowledge that you may wind up with painful injuries, AND in jail, is enough to give pause to many of such people bent on causing trouble.</p>

</i></p>
<p>Taunting a police dog? As someone who worked as a police officer, I have to say, this is asinine. When I hear of absurd laws like this it only reinforces my belief that we have arrived at a time when we simply make laws up without any regard for sound reasoning.</p>

			<p>In MAINE, no less!!!  Isn&rsquo;t this an answer to those dreamers who talk about escaping to some idyllic all-white nirvana somewhere over the misty horizon?  Wake up!  There is no such nirvana waiting for you.  There is nowhere left to run and hide. Every last pocket of whites will be seeded with its colony of Africans.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;On a positive note, the state is more than ninty- six percent white and its small cities still remain fairly civil; its non-white population little more than token. Northern american blacks and africans are highly urbanized so the racial demographic distribution of Maine won&rsquo;t realy change.&#8221; -  GNW</i></p>
<p>I find the above naive statement depressingly optimistic.  How many other places that were barely familiar with a black face,  said the same thing 30,40, 50 years ago &hellip; ploaces which are now over-run?</p>
<p>The point is that Maine is 96% white   &mdash;    and that&rsquo;s exactly the problem:  it&rsquo;s got to be changed, too darn many whites!  Various Powers That Be don&rsquo;t like that.  It will not be left to remain as it is now.  A coalition of starry-eyed idealists, mushy-brained churchmen, and the odd marriage of calculating communists and short-sighted capitalists, plus other self-serving groups with a private agenda, will see to it. Too many whites in one place make them nervous. Whites can be dangerous. They can get out of control, as history has shown. The seed colonies of Africans have already been planted (and not by accident!); now all they have to do is grow. Given the enormous disparity between white and African birthrates, nature will simply take its course from here. And of course Maine&rsquo;s taxpaying citizens will be made to pay for it all, subsidizing their own dispossession.</p>
<p>Only a few blacks?  Just a tiny percentage? What a ridiculous, naive argument! People were saying the same thing in France less than 40 years ago (&#8220;Oh, there are only so few of them! And all they want is a better life.&#8221;)  Well, now there are millions of them encircling the cities, and no one is saying they are so few any more. All this came about, under our noses, within a lifetime!  I&rsquo;m sure it was once the same in Detroit, and Toronto, and Harlem, and Michigan City, etc., etc., etc&hellip;..   It&rsquo;s an endless list.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t people wake up until it&rsquo;s too late?</p>

			<p>A similar situation happened here in Melbourne, Australia in our western suburbs when our police tried to arrest some Africans<br>
who were causing trouble&hellip;a large crowd of other Africans gathered and police had to backtrack to avoid a riot happening.<br>
Of course these Africans claim they are victims of police harrasment or brutality   and never acknowledge its their bad<br>
behavior that is the real cause of the problem<br>
 <br>
Its the same everyhwere you go,,,they cause trouble and then expect the bleeding heart liberal dominated mass media to<br>
help them gather some predictable sympathy (for the devil!)<br>
   Many of them come from Somalia and other East African countries<br>
Seeing the havoc their pirate brethren are causing of the coast of Somalia there are no surprises here <br>
 I think the recent publicity of these pirates and the fiasco unfolding in South Africa and with the upcoming World Cup there  is showing the  world how much Afica is a real nightmare hell hole and how much of that hell hole is being exported around the world coming to a city near you! <br>

			<p>The following exchange took place in the comment section of the original article. The response to the soft-headed feel good liberalism of the defender of the Sudanese is worth reposting here. I believe it expresses the opinion of those of us who see this madness clearly and without the rancor that often mars discussions of this type:</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
Syzygy of Chicago, IL </p>

You see these Sudanese and you see the color of their skin and the cut of their cloth, but nothing else. <br>
You do not see people trying to make the best of their lives in a strange land. <br>
You do not see their cultural contribution to the community. <br>
You do not see their fear of the system that so recently killed one of their own and has done nothing to solve a murder of one of their own. </p>
<p>And you have the audacity to criticize them for wanting to protect one of their own when unjustly confronted by armed men wearing black uniforms and boots? </p>
<p>Shame on you! </p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  - </p>
<p>Yes, shame on us. Shame on anyone who would place the safety of their own children above that of illegal aliens and refugee &#8220;guests&#8221; who disrespect the laws of the country you expect us to believe they care so much about. </p>
<p>Cultural contribution? Are you smoking crack? Does anybody care about facts anymore? Does anyone bother to look at the statistics? The crime rates of illegals? Of refugees? </p>
<p>Shame on YOU, I say, and anyone else who says we must continue to watch our tax dollars stolen to support people who break our laws, suck our medical and social services dry, and endanger the lives of our children instead of standing up and saying GET OUT NOW. </p>
<p>What will it take? How many more crimes committed? How many more billions in stolen tax dollars? You can keep pretending that events like these are isolated and that &#8220;all cities have crime&#8221;. But statistics do not lie. They are pouring into the country like never before, and they are becoming more aggressive, more demanding. We offer them virtually every single thing they could want or need, free of charge, and still it is never enough, and we are blamed for their bad behaviors. </p>
<p>More and more Americans are waking up to this. In cities small and large, whether they are men, women, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives. If you are an American citizen, it is time to say ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>I echo that sentiment. Enough is enough!</p>

			<p>I hope all AmRen followers write a letter to their representatives each time they post on this site. And don&rsquo;t stop there. Phone, fax (through numbersUSA) and any other means you can think of to stop the complete overthrow of this country by poor, uneducated illegals. Not only that - we need to stop all immigration until those who&rsquo;ve come correctly can be assimilated. Have you noticed the invaders speaking English? No, they are aided in every way to keep their language and culture. We have become about as diverse in the last 25-30 years as any country can be and still call itself the UNITED States. We are truly a Tower of Babel and it will never stop until our government quits being addicted to votes and &#8220;other compensations&#8221; from special interest groups.</p>

			<p>Blacks then whine &#8216;racism&rsquo; when businesses either close in their neighborhoods or don&rsquo;t open at all.  Detroit now lacks any large supermarkets because of the theft rate.  If there was a profit to be made, these stores would be jumping over one another to open a business in a black neighborhood.  Instead, blacks support other criminals.  In the end times, the Bible says that right will be wrong and wrong with be right.  The black community proves this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/180035" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsweek.com/id/180035</a></p>
<p>Why, they are the refugees who &#8220;saved&#8221; Lewiston.  Any native Lewiston yankees who&rsquo;d like to comment on that?</p>

			<p>  Fellow posters, allow me to go into a little more detail on the subject of Maine&rsquo;s blacks and other minorities. </p>
<p>Never said that &#8220;cold alone&#8221; would keep out black populations because it doesn&rsquo;t. But Maine&rsquo;s tough climate combined with it&rsquo;s &#8220;ruralness&#8221; does.  Ruralness (outside the southern US) is the most important factor here. This racial demograhic divide between urban and rural is current fact in Maine and will continue to keep black and other minorities numbers small compared to states like NY, PA and NJ. </p>
<p>Maine is only projected to slightly increase its population over the nest 20 years according to the latest census. Besides, the state lacks the urban infrastructure to support large minority populations on the dole unlike urbanized states. Without a large enough tax-paying citizenry federal subsidation can only go so far.</p>
<p>Could this all change in the future? Possibly, but not that much as long as Maine remains predominately rural and it will. Maine&rsquo;s economy would really be trashed if it weren&rsquo;t for it&rsquo;s tourism industry built upon its abundant natural resorces. Its outdoor economy has been well entrenched for many decades and will continue to be a central theme to the states identity.</p>
<p>Black populations (not individuals) existing outside cities is still the exception and not the rule, not just in Maine, but the northeast in general. Much thanks for the north&rsquo;s covert historical legacy of demographic &#8220;physical separation&#8221; between the races. Southerners should be so lucky.</p>
<p>One AmRen poster mentioned the Canadian cites of Toronto and Halifax with large black poulations(been there before). He helped make my point in that they are both &#8220;cities&#8221;. There&rsquo;s that urban connection again. Now drive outside those cities as they trasition from urban-suburban-to rural and the population trasform back into overwhelmingly  or at least predominately white with no compaints from me. </p>
<p>Me naive,- I&rsquo;d like to think not.</p>
<p>After all The Great North Woods, that biogeograhical region also includes much of Maine- my home state. </p>
<p>If you still disagree with my evaluation no hard feelings. Next topic please.</p>
<p>Regards as always,-GNW</p>

			<p>&#8221; This was in Kenosha, WI. &#8220;Posted by slickfifty at 6:15 PM on May 12 </p>
<p>Having destroyed Chicago and some of the suburbs in the 1950&rsquo;s, blacks moved to Wisconsin starting in the 1970&rsquo;s in search of more generous welfare benefits.  This is how they repay the Wisconsinites for taking them in and paying them to have their gangster children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>I lived in the northern suburbs of Chicago in the 1980&rsquo;s, just  a few miles from Kenosha and the Wisconsin border.  I remember reading articles about the mean old Kenosha school system having problems &#8220;adjusting&#8221; to the &#8220;cultural differences&#8221; of the transplanted black youth of Chicago.</p>
<p>And to think that many White Chicagoans driven out of their neighborhoods by black violence moved to Wisconsin in the hopes that &#8220;they&#8221; would never move so far as Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Now the cities of Wisconsin, not jsut Madison and Milwaukee but even Eau Claire, Kenosha and other once idyllic towns are violent crime ridden ghettoes.</p>
<p>Have they destroyed the landmark Frank Llyod Wright Johnson Wax headquarters building yet??</p>

			<p>Hmmm.  Let&rsquo;s see. The Sudan is hot and dry and is full of deserts and semi-arid areas and is full of black people.</p>
<p>What better place to put them than in cold and wet and woodsy Maine that is full of white people.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because there are people in the U.S. government who are trying to wipe out white people through miscegenation. Put blacks in one of the whitest states in the union and let nature take over and soon the white gene pool gets darker.</p>

You see these Sudanese and you see the color of their skin and the cut of their cloth, but nothing else. <br>
You do not see people trying to make the best of their lives in a strange land. <br>
You do not see their cultural contribution to the community. <br>
You do not see their fear of the system that so recently killed one of their own and has done nothing to solve a murder of one of their own. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if ALL of the black african immigrants are killed, it saves us taxpaying slaves a lot of grief. In fact, I hope it happens, it would be a &#8220;final solution&#8221; I support.</p>

<p>I see people who look nothing like me trying to take advantage of the prosperity MY ancestore - not theirs - created in MY land.<br>
If it&rsquo;s so strange and difficult here, they need to leave.</p>

<p>This was sounding like a perfect place to retire until you got to the &#8220;full of black people&#8221; part, if I wanted that! I would move to&hellip;any big city in the U.S.</p>
