	<p>In trying to adapt to a patchwork of often conflicting cultures, has civility become the casualty of accommodation? Illustration by Rebecca Yanovskaya In trying to adapt to a patchwork of often conflicting cultures, has civility become the casualty of accommodation?</p>
<p>When the landlady of my Toronto apartment building said an outraged neighbour had filed a complaint about me over an apparently inappropriate hallway interaction with his wife, my mind raced through the countless conversations I&rsquo;ve had with fellow tenants, none of which seemed a possible source of offence.</p>
<p>It turns out, it wasn&rsquo;t a salacious transaction that had caused the complaint, but rather a neighbourly and  &mdash;  to me  &mdash;  entirely forgettable greeting, little more than a brief &#8220;good morning&#8221; as I passed my neighbours on the way to work.</p>
<p>Still, it was enough of an affront for the man  &mdash;  once a doctor somewhere in the Middle East, my landlady clarified  &mdash;  to feel I had broken a cultural taboo. The incident started an awkward feud which has involved warnings not to repeat my indiscretion and one face-to-face shouting match, which included allusions to my impending death.</p>
<p>I expect the battle will wage on, as we appear to be stuck at an impasse.</p>
<p>His Muslim upbringing has ingrained in him a sense of entitlement to demand I not speak directly to his wife; and my prairie upbringing has ingrained in me a duty to strive for polite cohesion with my neighbours.</p>
<p>My landlady, who has handled the complaint with tittering trepidation, hasn&rsquo;t helped dispel the friction. She has told me to adhere to the demands because the man &#8220;could be dangerous,&#8221; directing me to literally turn my back to the couple as they pass, never make eye contact and never hold the elevator for them, no matter what.</p>
<p>Life among neighbours has become increasingly complicated by multiculturalism, in this case making even the most affable salutation or good Samaritan gesture a practice in walking on eggshells. But in trying to adapt to a patchwork of often conflicting cultures, has civility become the casualty of accommodation?</p>
<p>I grew up in Manitoba, where it was an affront to your neighbour not to be cordial. If you didn&rsquo;t greet them by name you could be talked about in hushed voices and risked being labelled standoffish. Community amongst neighbours was not something to consider, it was a way of life. Call it prairie law.</p>
<p>Since moving to Toronto, I have lived in condos where asking your neighbour for the proverbial cup of sugar is greeted by skeptical, confused faces and closed doors.</p>
<p>But the majority have been open to the time-passing chats that break down barriers.</p>
<p>My midtown apartment building is home mostly to young professionals and is the definition of nondescript. I frequently hold doors for people carrying packages and say &#8220;you&rsquo;re welcome&#8221; if they show gratitude. I have run errands for unfamiliar neighbours because I was heading out into the rain anyway and there was no point in us both getting wet. I chat like a fool while waiting in the laundry room.</p>
<p>Of course, denying me the right to greet a woman in our shared hallway fails to measure up to reported conflicts that have caused a culture clash, such as Canada&rsquo;s reaction to a recent Afghan law allowing some husbands to withhold food until their wives agree to sex, or the case of a Toronto-area father and son accused of killing a daughter who refused to wear a hijab at school.</p>
<p>I discussed my situation with the head of a prominent Muslim women&rsquo;s rights organization, who was understandably more concerned with the living conditions of the woman in question. She described the segregation of sexes as one of the worst examples of fundamentalist Islamic misinterpretation and dismissed the idea that my greeting could be construed as an offence.</p>
<p>Keep smiling, keep saying hello, she advised. The successful cohesion of cultures requires concessions from both sides. Offence or not, I have continued to greet those I share a building with, although the couple next door continue living in reclusion.</p>
<p>The alternative to this is to live amongst strangers in an icy standoff, fearful that the slightest attempt at community might be viewed as an affront. The alternative is to abandon prairie law, turn your back and close your eyes. And that sounds terrible.<br>

		<p>A prominent Michigan &#8220;institution of higher learning&#8221; recently installed &#8220;footbaths&#8221; so that the muslims would not use the toilets or sinks to wash their feet.  I have found these footbaths to be excellent urinals.  I dare ANY muslim to challenge me on my use of these &#8220;footbaths&#8221; because they were paid for with MY TAX DOLLARS.</p>

<p>Just so.  Some might say that this would be a pointless gesture, that would accomplish nothing more than to make the immigrant in question uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Exactly.  The more uncomfortable they are, the less welcome they feel, the more likely they will be to leave, and the more of them who will leave.  That is an end in and of itself.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s best to make your friendly advances towards whites. We understand each other much better so the chances of having a nice outcome are best. Towards non-whites just be polite as the situation demands but otherwise be instrumental towards them.</p>

<p>Nice idea, but we know where the government would take a stand in muslims vs. ANYONE NOT MUSLIM! now don&rsquo;t we. Mustn&rsquo;t outrage the muslims. Muslims will NEVER, EVER return to where they came from, they are HERE and THERE to stay until death do they part.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s sad is his wife is probably in for some domestic violence by her &#8220;husband&#8221;, since she clearly invited the unwanted male attention. </p>
<p>What I find really appalling is the advice from the head of the woman&rsquo;s group, who said for him to &#8220;Keep smiling, keep saying hello.&#8221;  So now this guy gets involuntarily drafted into some weird culture war he never asked for, all in the name of &#8220;successful cohesion of cultures.&#8221;  So in addition to the daily struggle of working, keeping one&rsquo;s relationships on an even keel, paying taxes, and doing the myriad of other day to day things all of us must do, he now has to worry about some angry husband, all the while being encouraged to goad what may be a sociapath by continuing to smile and talk to his wife on every possible occasion.  I just find it disgusting that this guy has to now saddle his life with a burden he didn&rsquo;t ask for and something that no reasonable person should have to put up with.  </p>

		<p>If you see the man in the hallway, spit on the floor in front of him and dare him to look you in the eyes. This is NOT his country and it never will be. He can take his goat back with him to the Middle East on the next plane. He is fast becoming an unwelcome guest&hellip;..with no entitlement whatsoever.</p>
<p>If that does not work&hellip;..get a dog&hellip;..a big black dog, that slobbers uncontrollably, and wait for your uptight neighbor in the hallway.</p>

<p>As an American, I would no more cater to THEIR cultural mores than I&rsquo;d want to marry a Muslim immigrant. Time for all Whites to wake the hell up, draw the proverbial line in the sand and tell the damned immigrants to cross it at their risk. That they damned well adapt themselves to the White majority&rsquo;s lifestyle and not expect us to kowtow to them.</p>

		<p>Muslims cause problems wherever they go. If one goes to another country, it&rsquo;s up to the newcomer to adhere to the rules of the culture. If they can&rsquo;t, then THEY need to go home. Better yet, stupid Whites need to stop allowing immigration of people of different cultures. Common sense will tell you that you can&rsquo;t throw people of all different cultures, races and beliefs together and have peace and harmony. When are Whites ever going to wake up?</p>

<p>This is the future of whites here in the U.S. if we ever give up our guns. In fact, this future had already arrived for American whites in places with strict gun laws like California and Massachusetts. American whites need to get armed and get politically active. If you&rsquo;re not willing to &#8220;come out of the closet&#8221; (so to speak) as a white nationalist, then get active in the field of gun rights. It&rsquo;s much less politically incorrect than pro-white activism, and just as important, since probably the only thing standing between American whites and genocide right now is the Second Amendment. </p>

<p>Here in Arizona, you don&rsquo;t even need a permit to carry a gun, as long as it&rsquo;s not concealed. I had some problems with ethnic intimidation myself a while back. A few days spent strolling around the neighborhood with sidearm strapped to my hip put a stop to that real quick. Didn&rsquo;t even have to say anything. </p>

How odd   &mdash;   that by being friendly and pleasant,  we make them feel uncomfortable. And they complain about it!   <br>
What a crazy world we live in!  </p>
<p>PS. Anonymous made a very good point that I had not thought of:  that the unfortunate wife is likely to be in for some &#8220;domestic violence&#8221; for having attracted this unwanted attention.  <br>

		<p> I spent a number of years in other countries and lived in different parts of the United States. I found it better to respect the local culture while maintaining my own.<br>
 However, it seems that people are coming here from around the world, maintaining thier own culture and try to push ours aside and recreate the culture they left. To me, this is a form of pure and total disrespect.<br>
 The truly worrisome part of all this is how the majority of the white population seem to be powerless to stop it from happening.</p>

<p>Right. It doesn&rsquo;t matter for Muslims if you like them or not. They would prefer to be ignored as they want to form their islamic enclaves. They don&rsquo;t come to work and return but they come to stay and drain your money.</p>
<p>But you can ignore their demands. Make them understand that they live in a Western country. Forbid islamic veil everywhere, not only at public institutions. Cut off their benefits. If they commit crime or rebel, deport them immediately, the whole family if possible.  </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
Analyzing this dilemma, it seems to me that our problem is that westerners have been brainwashed endlessly about the need for tolerance of others and  with the presumption that all cultures are equal.  That all races are equal.  That all peoples worship the same God.  That all religions lead to Heaven.  Et cetera.  </p>
<p>Moslems, on the other hand, have been instilled with no such notion. They are told by their religion, and very explicitly, that their way of life is frankly superior  to all others and that non-believers are benighted and backward  (if not downright wicked and sinful).  Is it any surprise they are contemptuous? </p>
<p>Indeed, what they teach about others, would be illegal in many Christian countries today, if Christians taught the same about them. You would be imprisoned for  &#8220;hate speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>No matter how educated, cultured,  intelligent, accomplished, or rich you may be, you are still, to Moslems, their inferiors.   Therefore, they see no reason to adjust themselves to your heathen  way of life  (why should they?),  while you are constantly prodded, warned and admonished to adjust to theirs.</p>
<p>It is a very unbalanced situation. We have lost our cultural/racial self-confidence, stripped of our mental armor, while they have not.  Hence, we are at a great disadvantage in this current silent war that is being waged against us.</p>

		<p>I think I would be one of those who would do as suggested above: continue to speak directly to the couple.  In so doing, I&rsquo;d hope that the husband would get so angry as to have a stroke and drop dead right there on the spot.  Otherwise, the first time he tried to engage in a shouting match with me, I&rsquo;d just have to rearrange his face with my right fist - striking directly where his nose is (was?).  After that, a good free-for-all is good for the spirits. </p>
<p>Or, as Gemalo wrote earlier, the business end of a Colt would work, too.</p>
