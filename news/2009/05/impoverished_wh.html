<h1><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article6251838.ece">Impoverished White Afrikaners Pin Their Hopes on Jacob Zuma</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Clayton, Times of London, May 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a rundown squatter camp just outside Pretoria, Casandra Nell, an Afrikaner, is in no doubt who she wants to be South Africa&rsquo;s next President. &#8220;Zuma, Zuma, Zuma,&#8221; she repeats with a toothless grin accompanied by a little jig.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable testimony to the political charm of Jacob Zuma, who will be inaugurated today as the fourth black President of South Africa, that even the country&rsquo;s growing band of poor whites  &mdash;  the greatest losers since the end of apartheid  &mdash;  pin their hopes of a better life on a Zulu goatherd turned liberation struggle commander, whose election rally song, Umshini Wam, translates as &#8220;Bring me my machinegun&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;He came here to see us and promised water and electricity. He will come back when he is President, I am sure. If not, I will go to his office and see him. He said I can come and visit anytime,&#8221; Ms Nell said.</p>
<p>Mr Zuma was shocked at the poverty that he saw when he visited the camp a few months ago. Most black leaders deny the existence of real poverty among poorly educated, unskilled whites who used to get menial jobs simply because of their colour.</p>
<p>Esther Bloem, who lives in a nearby wooden shed, admitted that she was another convert. &#8220;Zuma is a good listener. He said he did not know there were poor white people in this country. He was shocked but he wants a place for all of us in South Africa. I wanted to vote for him but there was no transport,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As she spoke, military jets flew overhead  &mdash;  practising for today&rsquo;s multimillion-pound inauguration ceremony, which is set to be attended by at least 30 heads of state and lowerranking delegations from Africa and the rest of the world. Britain will be represented by Lord Malloch-Brown, the Minister for Africa.</p>
<p>Activists are angered that President Mugabe of Zimbabwe will attend but hopeful that Mr Zuma, who is supported by the strong unionist movement, will take a much tougher line on the crisis in that country than his predecessor, Thabo Mbeki.</p>
<p>The Sudanese President, Omar al-Bashir, is keeping away after he was told that South Africa would serve the arrest warrant of the International Criminal Court issued for his alleged role in atrocities and genocide in Darfur. North Korea, which is again accused of nuclear ambitions, will be represented by its No 2 official, Kim Yong Nam.</p>
<p>The swearing-in at the imposing Afrikaner-built Union Buildings, where Nelson Mandela became South Africa&rsquo;s first black President in 1994, will be followed by a sumptuous meal at which caviar and champagne will be served and a showbiz-style party at which the country&rsquo;s many leading musicians will play.</p>
<p>Mr Zuma, 67, has a lot to celebrate. His political obituary was written when he was dismissed as the Deputy President by his arch-rival at the time, President Mbeki, in 2005 after alleged links to an arms bribery scandal. He was later acquitted in a rape trial but widely derided for knowingly having unprotected sex with an HIV-positive woman and saying he took a shower afterwards to prevent infection.</p>
<p>The self-educated Mr Zuma, a consummate politician, fought back and two years later toppled the aloof, Shakespeare-quoting Mr Mbeki from the presidency of the African National Congress (ANC). His supporters then ousted Mr Mbeki from the presidency at the end of last year and replaced him with a caretaker leader.</p>
<p>Many blacks have seen little improvement in their lives since the end of apartheid 15 years ago and are deeply resentful of a flashy black middle class that emerged in the Mbeki era.</p>
<p>Mr Zuma, who served ten years on Robben Island alongside Mr Mandela before going into exile to lead the ANC&rsquo;s armed wing, steered the party to a landslide victory in elections last month. His charm offensive towards poor whites, most of whom opposed the end of apartheid, demonstrates his skill as a populist politician. There is virtually no minority group that he has not courted and won over.</p>
<p>He may now find that easy compared with trying to meet the expectations he has raised. Valentine Allen, surrounded by stray dogs and dozing pigs, who lost his job as a security guard because of affirmative action policies, said he voted ANC for the first time, such was his belief in Mr Zuma. &#8220;I know he will help us,&#8221; he said.<br>

			<p>I didn&rsquo;t have top read this to know the huge folly of &#8220;pinning their hopes&#8221; on a black. This statetment HAD to come from blacks because the White South Africans I personally know, KNOW BETTER.</p>

			<p>Wow. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that S. Africa is such a hell-hole that they are actually glad Zuma is president. I wonder when the blacks will finish off the Whites? I believe it&rsquo;s going to happen sooner rather than later. </p>

			<p>I have news for these Whites. They can pack it up. The only thing that will help them is to leave South Africa now that it is run by blacks. They should know from experience, like I do, that anything black-run, a country, a neighborhood, a school, whatever, is nothing but dysfunction and chaos. There is no hope for a black-run anything. If I were Ms.Nell, I&rsquo;d be looking to immigrate to a &#8220;white country&#8221; but it won&rsquo;t be easy, precisely because she is white. The same will hold true if we become mexican-run.</p>

			<p>This article is proof positive of the effectiveness and lethality of liberal leftist propaganda.  Even after seeing their nation collapse, seeing the economy and infrastructure crumble, and seeing themselves forced into slums, large numbers of South African Whites continue to support the diversity drivel and persist in the fantasy that the Black government will look after them.</p>
<p>Madness, sheer madness.  But troubling indeed for Westerners who have allowed their own children to be indoctrinated in the same fashion over the last few decades.  Our own younger generations harbor the same seeds of madness, and if we don&rsquo;t learn how to capture their hearts with truth, they will turn our nations down the same sorry path South Africa has taken.</p>

			<p>This is in the London Sunday Times.  What was their position on apartheid when apartheid existed?  And they have the audacity to note white poverty to ZA.  There wasn&rsquo;t much white poverty in ZA a generation ago.</p>

			<p>I think it&rsquo;s perhaps best not to think too much about Africa and Jacob Zuma.  Joseph Conrad summed matters up quite nicely:</p>
<p>The prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us, welcoming us-who could tell?  We were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings; we glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse.  We could not understand because we were too far and could not remember because we were travelling in the night of first ages, of those ages that are gone, leaving hardly a sign-and no memories.  </p>

			<p>This is sad, fortunately I left South Africa many years ago as the inevitable became obvious. A pity these people don&rsquo;t realize that Zuma is a wolf in sheep clothes. His background is hardcore communist and vehemently anti-white and anti-western values.</p>

			<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want this Zuma to be my saviour.<br>
From his rape trial&hellip;..</p>
<p>SA&rsquo;s Zuma &#8216;showered to avoid HIV&rsquo; <br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4879822.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4879822.stm</a><br>
<i>Mr Zuma&rsquo;s testimony that he did not use a condom during the encounter, despite knowing the woman was HIV-positive, caused dismay among local Aids activists.</i></p>
<p>A anecdote like this would not fill me with much confidence regarding the charactor of this leader or his judgement. Certainly not something you&rsquo;d associate with a iconic leader like Winston Churchill for instances.<br>
Biazzre really.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
Also from &#8216;Ross Kemps on Gangs&rsquo; on the South African &#8216;numbers&rsquo; gangs.<br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/qn9cqw" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/qn9cqw</a> (video)</p>
<p>Watch the first two minutes of this video, where Mr Kemp has gained the confidence of some of the Cape Flats Coloured/ Mulatto&rsquo;s (though they are mixes of Europeans, Indians, Malays, various Bantu tribes and indigenous Khoi/ San), most notorious gang members &#8216;the Americans&rsquo; (whilst they smoke meth).</p>
<p>For a classic quote about &#8220;the Black man is keeping us down&#8221;.<br>
Which reinforces one of my personal views that all races (except for us sucidial Whites), at the end of the day really just care about themselves. <br>
As should we, &#8220;charity begins at home&#8221;.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>

			<p>from a tactical standpoint it is interesting to note that Zuma is zulu whereas the ANC and the majority in ZA are xhosa. zulus and xhosas actually fought a tribal war around the time that apartheid was under pressure. therefore, its quite odd to see a zulu as head of the ANC. indeed, many xhosa are displeased with it and some are actually leaving the ANC because of it. Zuma needs all the supporters he can get which is why he is reaching out to ALL the minority groups in ZA. im sure he reached out to the coloreds and hindus as well as the afrikaners. im not sure this is a situation where he can just promise them something and stab them in the back. whether Zuma intends to treat the afrikaners fairly or not, hes the best chance they have. and i rather think he needs their political support, as well. at the very least, Zuma and the zulus wont be persecuting them the way Mbeki and the xhosa have been.</p>

<p>I have been told by White SA that they have been denied entry visas into the U.S. and certainly not as political refugees. Not really sure if this is true, but WHITE SA (Former co-workers) did tell me that. They have their families in Europe and Kuwait.</p>

<p><br>
Comrade Zuma is only now learning that there are white people in his country who aren&rsquo;t fabulously wealthy? I&rsquo;m sitting here on the other side of the world, never been within 1000 miles of SA, yet even I know that country&rsquo;s working-class whites have been Affirmative-Action&rsquo;d out of their jobs and reduced to squatting, begging, drawing their own water, and subjected to countless other humiliations and dangers. </p>
<p>So whatever Jacob &#8220;Mshini&#8221; Zuma might be   &mdash;   and what I personally think he is would never get past the AR moderator so I won&rsquo;t say it   &mdash;   the man is obviously NOT &#8220;a good listener,&#8221; or on top of the situation, or in command of the facts about the nation he&rsquo;s about to take over. </p>
<p>And any Afrikaners who delude themselves into thinking otherwise are, I&rsquo;m sorry to say, in for a very, VERY rude awakening. </p>

			<p>Ie&rsquo;s only a matter of time, and likely not much, before the remaining whites in SA are slaughtered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how the rest of the &#8220;civilized&#8221; world<br>
reacts to the genocide.  My guess is that, at least here in the US, there will no help forthcoming, but a great deal of pious tut-tutting to the effect that the murdered whites, whose great crime was being born in SA, are merely getting their just deserts.</p>
<p>I hope for their sake that better and more moral nations will take them in.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Do we even deserve to survive?&#8221;</p>
<p>Flamethrower, I was wondering something similar.  Shame on us for not having established funds for resettling poor whites from South Africa.  And shame on &#8216;our&rsquo; churches for not earmarking portions of our donations for white relief (from all the hundreds of millions they squander on the African Continent each year).</p>
<p>Jews divert sizeable portions of their estates toward relief efforts for fellow Jews.  Why can&rsquo;t WASPs do that?  The Rothschilds and the Warburgs would still be rich, had they not contributed so much to Jewish charities.  What do we WASPs have?  Race traitors like Rockefeller, who endowed all manner of subversive organizations&hellip;&hellip;.and the latest, Bill Gates, who gave away most of his money (and the power it could have given him) to causes that benefit non-whites in far-away places.</p>
<p>Maybe we should be helping South Africa&rsquo;s poorest fly in to whelp out their anchor babies, just like everybody else does.  Maybe white South African women would make good alternative mail-order brides for desperate American bachelors.  Maybe elderly white South Africans could become ordained ministers&hellip;.a huge immigration loophole.  Mississippi women used to take up collections to &#8220;feed the starving Armenians&#8221;.  Why can&rsquo;t we rally to save the emperiled Afrikaners?</p>

That one word &#8216;racist&rsquo;, is a very powerful word isn&rsquo;t it.</p>
<p>Once it is directed at you, there is no way to defend yourself using only a single word yourself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not the racist you are&hellip;blah, blah&#8221;.<br>
&#8220;Me a racist, after all I&rsquo;ve done for &hellip;.blah, blah&#8221;.<br>
&#8220;I have never judged anyone&hellip;..blah,blah&#8221;</p>
<p>But then &#8216;rapist&rsquo; is also a singular, powerful word.<br>
But I suppose &#8220;racist must trump rapist&#8221;, in the power stakes.</p>

			<p>Since the financial meltdown it has become almost impossible to move out of South Africa. Some South Africans are even repatriating due to job losses.</p>
<p>The solution would be to organize an evacuation for those who want to move out, alternatively to put pressure unto the ANC. </p>
<p>At present there are too many legal and practical obstacles to do it through official channels inside this country. </p>
<p>We are not able to do it on our own - we need foreign assistance.</p>
<p>Here lies the challenge to western nationalists - assist a brother nation in need.</p>
