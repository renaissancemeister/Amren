<h1>HIV Among Blacks Near Epidemic Levels, Advocates Say</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cheryl Wills, NY1 (New York City), May 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of local activists and ministers are pushing for President Barack Obama to declare HIV/AIDS a public health emergency in African-American communities. NY1&rsquo;s Cheryl Wills filed the following report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the latest Centers for Disease Control statistics are of great concern to many.</p>
<p>African-Americans account for 45 percent, almost half, of new HIV infections. HIV related deaths are also highest among blacks and is the fourth leading cause of death for black men and third for black women.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is more dangerous than the swine flu and I hope that the country will recognize that if we can solve this, then we can move forward in addressing other health disparities,&#8221; said Reverend Dr. Calvin Butts, chairman of the National Black Leadership Commission on AIDS.</p>
<p>Both Butts [Calvin Butts, chairman of the National Black Leadership Commission on AIDS] and Fields [C. Virginia Fields, president of the National Black Leadership Commission on AIDS] are behind new legislation which, for the first time, specifically addresses AIDS in the African-American community.</p>
<p>H.R. 1964, which is sponsored by Harlem congressman Charlie Rangel, calls on President Obama to declare HIV/AIDS an epidemic in the black community, directs the department of Health and Human Services to provide funds for outreach and testing, and requires a comprehensive study to explain factors that lead to higher rates of HIV and AIDS among black Americans.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that I can&rsquo;t think of the last time I went to a restaurant or grocery store where the people handling the food wasn&rsquo;t entirely Mexican (or occasionally Asian), and since I also don&rsquo;t fornicate with Africans,  my vote would be to worry about Swine flu and let AIDS burn itself out. </p>
<p>This probably would have happened long ago except do-gooders keep insisting we provide life extending drugs to chronically promiscuous disease spreaders.<br>

			<p>So now black leaders want to waste our tax $ on a &#8220;comprehensive study&#8221; to determine why blacks have higher AIDS infection rates than everyone else?</p>
<p>Are they unaware that blacks are more likely to:<br>
-have unprotected sex<br>
-have multiple parners<br>
-live &#8220;on the down low&#8221;<br>
-engage in prison sex</p>
<p>Do they really not know this or are they only pretending to be clueless?  </p>

<p>Perhaps those &#8220;factors&#8221; are poor impulse controls, low I.Q.&rsquo;s, inability to delay immediate gratification, greater promiscuity and lack of responsibility. </p>

<p>THE CURE for HIV/AIDS&hellip;&hellip;.AMBUSH</p>
<p>THE IDEA that AMBUSH cures AIDS<br>
is being proven by the more than 400 individuals who have taken a dose of 60 ml three times daily for 21 days. The result is that AMBUSH &#8216;KILLS&rsquo; the virus by causing the protein envelope to rupture and the viral particles are discarded by the white blood cells. AMBUSH is able to &#8216;KILL&rsquo; the virus that are &#8216;hiding&rsquo; in the lymph system by its &#8216;natural radioactive&rsquo; properties. This process allows the body to &#8216;return to normal health&rsquo; with a corresponding immunity to that or those strains of the virus.</p>
<p>What is AMBUSH ?<br>
AMBUSH is a radioactive isotope of uranium that is found in the &#8216;palm&rsquo; plant of which there are more than 3000 species. When ingested, AMBUSH causes the body temperature in the trunk area to rise to about 102 degrees when the individual is sleeping. The preparation takes four hours per batch, which is then given to the individuals for consumption 60 ml three times daily for 21 days. AMBUSH is a herbal preparation in this form but it contains an active ingredient which is a &#8216;NEW&rsquo; crystalline substance, a drug from the &#8216;palm plant&rsquo; similarly to ASPIRIN originating from the willow tree bark</p>
<p>RESULTS:<br>
After 21 days on AMBUSH, ALL the individuals experienced a decrease in viral load to undetectable, an increase in cd4, increase in RBC, an improvement in general health such as more color to the face, decrease in Buffalo hump, an increase in gluteal muscles, a decrease to having no joint pains whereby individuals can bend to touch their toes, and walk up steps are but a few examples. There is also a dramatic increase in their sexual appetite beginning after the first week of therapy</p>
<p>DISCUSSION:<br>
In any plant concoction such as percolated &#8216;tea&rsquo;, there are 30-40,000 compounds, whi ch would take the scientific community twenty years to isolate one particular ingredient if they knew what they were looking for. The LORD GOD has given me seven steps to isolate the active ingredient, which is soft and metallic in nature and has a carbon- uranium-sulfur-(classified)-phentolamine configuration or structure. This is similar to Federick Kekule and the discovery of the benzene ring where he dreamt the structure.</p>
<p>As an antiviral and &#8216;natural radioactivity&rsquo; producing agent, AMBUSH is also effective against leukemia, lupus and HPV. Here I am saying that I have &#8216;GIVEN&rsquo; AMBUSH in the same &#8216;strength&rsquo; and dosage to patients with leukemia, lupus and HPV. A 35 year old male with HIV found it difficult to impossible to urinate was put on &#8216;green tea&rsquo; and water while the doctors contemplated prostrate surgery. One of the doctors gave him my number, I sent him a supply of AMBUSH an d he has not been given any more ARV&rsquo;s, since taking AMBUSH 18 months ago, is in &#8216;good&rsquo; health and has expressed a willingness to be examined by HIV investigators like many others who have taken AMBUSH.</p>
<p>I have sent this &#8216;IDEA&rsquo; to most HIV research agencies, scientist of the field, universities, hospitals, clinics, politicians and news agencies to which it is REJECTED because the name of THE LORD GOD is mentioned. He has steered me scientifically through the processes such as which plant and how to produce the active ingredient. What are the odds of a Florida Pharmacist picking a plant would contain the CURE for HIV/AIDS ?<br>
I have never charged any of the people for their supply of AMBUSH but a life saving has been spent on the project with NO renumeration from any sources because AMBUSH falls outside the walls of modern medicine and research.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL:</p>
<p>My proposal is that I PROVE that AMBUSH CURES HIV/AIDS by giving it to a number of END-STAGE or DRUG-RESISTANT people and the scientific community watches their recovery. This proposal addresses the problem in that I have already outlaid the results to be obtained.</p>
<p>This IDEA is unconventional in that the scientific community has rejected AMBUSH because I say it is GOD given. Secondly if I wrote it according to certain standards, then it might be peer reviewed. However, THE LORD GOD has also shown me that there are five enzyme systems associated with the virus, reverse transcriptase, protease, fusion and two more of which causes the virus to be AIRBOURNE. This means that without DIVINE intervention mankind and ALL warm- blooded mammals will be extinct in a number of years.</p>
<p>The PROOF of what I am saying is found in scientific papers wherein it is found that when the protease cuts the viral strands, it cuts it at DIFFERENT lengths EVERY time, to which it should always be a valine at the end but is a different amino acid every time. This is why it is IMPOSSIBLE to produce a VACCINE.</p>
<p>Since this is NOT a hypothesis but there are about 400 individuals who have taken AMBUSH, here lies a vast area in which to check, recheck and confirm that AMBUSH CURES AIDS. Let it be mentioned that during the HIV reproductive cycle, reverse transcriptase converts viral RNA into DNA compatible to human genetic materials. Thus the human DNA has been &#8216;hijacked&rsquo; and since each person has a DIFFERENT DNA, then the new viral copy is unique to that person which shows that each individual has a DIFFERENT STRAIN of the virus. Consider two HIV positive people swapping viral strains and increasing its complexity with multiple partners.<br>
It can also be proposed that they be revisited as proof that the strain or strains that they had were &#8216;killed&rsquo; at the time of taking AMBUSH considering that a person can catch as many different strains as there are people who are infected by HIV.<br>
I am also willing to work with the scientific community in identifying those individuals who took AMBUSH and wish to be identified with this process notwithstanding that some are stigmatized while others are jubilant,</p>
<p>Once AMBUSH is verified as being able to accomplish that which is aforementioned then the next stage might be the natural and artificial synthesis of the substance.</p>
<p>Finally, if this is accepted or not, believed or not, THE LORD GOD always wins and this is the heavenly truth to which AMBUSH was divinely given to mankind for the CURE of HIV/AIDS and it will be here forever. Apostle Shada Mishe.</p>

<p>Maybe when they get this one figured out they can move on to trying to figure out whey the Black illegitimate rate is over 70%. It might have something to do with why the HIV/AIDS rate is so high among Blacks. Ya think?</p>

			<p>This is not going to change. A change would require the people to change their behavior. That won&rsquo;t happen because they are incapable of changing their behavior and because the liberals won&rsquo;t tell them to change - can&rsquo;t be judgemental.<br>

			<p>Not surprising at all, what did the general community expect? It is extremely unfortunate that black men have such high rates of HIV/AIDS but why don&rsquo;t they look after themselves? It is not just in the US but Britian, Sth. AFrica, Africa and anywhere else that blacks live; AIDS, tropical diseases, STD&rsquo;s are always much higher in the black community. It is suicide to have sex with black men esp. considering that they disease ridden. Under the U.N. refugee charter it is&#8221;discriminatory&#8221; to deny access of HIV/AIDS infected people into the US, Australia and Europe. Our Govts. are allowing thousands of disease ridden Africans and Asian into our nations, what a joke.</p>
<p>Here is Australia, Afrcians still only make up a small percentage of the population but it is growing due to this stoopid humanitarian programmes whereby disease ridden Africans come here under the UN refugee programme and the white taxpayer foots the bill. Aren&rsquo;t there better and much more urgent matters to spend our hite money on? Spending money on these misfits is racist and against my people. </p>
<p> Proverb: &#8220;The Left riot and shout babyish things. Well, that is what you are talking about isn&rsquo;t it? The Right, however, is very ominously quiet. &#8220;Beware the anger of a patient man.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Right is coming back, indeed beware you left wing do-gooders. I am patient and waiting.</p>

			<p>Like the Compton blacks vs hispanic garage conversions, this is nothing more than a fight between privileged interest groups over federal money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s White male gays vs blacks.  Who will get the most funds?  Not funds to cure the disease mind you, but funds to sit around offices earning $40,000 to $80,000 per year &#8220;raising consciousnes&#8221; with awareness campaigns.</p>
<p>National Review once did some research on the AIDS community.  It found that there were 11 AIDS workers to every 1 AIDS patients.  But only 1, just 1 of those AIDS workers had anything to do with medical research or medical care.  </p>
<p>Medical care included all hospital and nursing home workers, clerks, janitors etc, not just medical occupations.</p>
<p>It came out to 10 tax funded people sitting around community organization offices allegedly raising awareness for every <br>
1 AIDS patient.</p>
<p>A similiar study in England found the same thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s Gay White males against the blacks in the struggle for well paid do nothing jobs blithering and blathering about AIDS.</p>
<p>Ever heard of AIDS support groups?  They are volunteer.There are 2 kinds of groups, practical support and spiritual support.</p>
<p>The practical support people actually do some good.  They shop, clean, do laundry and cook for people who are so disabled by AIDS they can&rsquo;t take care of themselves any more.  The spritual support group just visits and blathers on about nothing.</p>
<p>Even in San Francisco, incubator of the AIDS epidemic there are few takers for the practical support groups. No liberal wants to soil their hands with cleaning, shopping or cooking for AIDS patients.</p>

			<p>A &#8220;comprehensive study&#8221;?  Are they kidding?  The cause of the spread of HIV has been ANYTHING but a secret for the last quarter-century.</p>
<p>What they are saying when they pretend they don&rsquo;t understand this phenomenon is &#8220;We are idiots and we think you are idiots as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a non-idiot, the spread of venereal diseases is no mystery to me.</p>

			<p>Just think of all the money that has been spent (wasted?) on AIDS research and care. AIDS is both an easily preventable and largely black disease. We are rewarding irresponsible and promiscuous people (largely blacks or Africans) for their bad behaviour with our &#8216;health dollars&rsquo; while millions of Whites (and others) suffer with cancer or alzheimer - through no fault of their own. Even worse many of those who have their lives extended by AIDS treatments just continue to spread the disease to others instead of being grateful for a second chance and altering their lifestyle. This also means the illness never gets a chance to &#8216;burn itself out&rsquo;. These people generally do not deserve our tax dollars.</p>

			<p>See, this is my Number One Pet Peeve concerning black people, in a nutshell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ll never get anywhere as long as the attitude persists, encouraged by their &#8220;leaders&#8221; and by the liberal mindset, that if a group isn&rsquo;t doing well, it&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s fault but their own.</p>
<p>When HIV was first discovered, it was mainly attacking gay people.  Even they, who are good at victimization themselves, took a realistic attitude about it, and began spreading the word that the way to prevent the spread of HIV was to stop all the mindless promiscuity.</p>
<p>So now HIV is mainly attacking black people.  Is the message being sent out to stop the mindless promiscuity?</p>
<p>No, of course not.  The message, as always, is it&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s fault but their own.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s due to institutionalized racism.  It&rsquo;s due to black people not having equal access to health care.  And among the real whackos, such as Rev. Wright, it&rsquo;s due to the evil white people *inventing* HIV in the first place, for the express purpose of wiping out black people (apparently, according to this theory, the evil white people sneak into black peoples&rsquo; homes in the middle of the night and inject them with HIV.)</p>
<p>As we all know here, the reason HIV is spreading among blacks more than any other group is that mindless promiscuity mentioned above.  Period.</p>
