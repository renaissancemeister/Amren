<h1><a href="https://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/may/13/foreclosures-immigration-linked/">Foreclosures, Immigration Linked in Report</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Timothy Pratt, Las Vegas Sun, May 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Counties with high foreclosure rates also tend to have large immigrant populations, according to a Pew Hispanic Center report released Tuesday.</p>
<p>The study ranked Clark County sixth nationwide in foreclosure rates last year with 8.9 percent of the valley&rsquo;s houses in the courts. Nearly 1 in 4 heads of household locally were foreign-born, much higher than the national rate of 4.7 percent. Half of those immigrants were Hispanic.</p>
<p>But the study&rsquo;s main author, Rakesh Kochhar, cautioned that focusing on those factors can lead to a &#8220;chicken and egg situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The two things appear together, but is there a causal relationship? Not necessarily,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Kochhar noted that jobs building houses drew many immigrants to the Las Vegas Valley in the past two decades. An unknown number of those workers bought homes.</p>
<p>The report also shows that Hispanics, blacks and minorities in general entered subprime mortgages at higher rates than the rest of the population. Nationwide, for example, 27.6 percent of home loans to Hispanics in 2007 were high-priced and a third of loans to blacks were in the same category. Only 1 in 10 loans to whites were high-priced. So areas with higher shares of minorities tend to have higher numbers of homeowners with loans at risk of entering foreclosure.</p>
<p>Kochhar&rsquo;s report, titled &#8220;Through Boom and Bust: Minorities, Immigrants and Homeownership,&#8221; shows that counties with high foreclosure rates exhibit other factors, including rising unemployment rates and sinking home values.</p>
<p>Clark County&rsquo;s unemployment rate for March was 10.4 percent, tenth-highest among major metropolitan areas nationwide. The Pew report looks at unemployment rates only for 2008 as a whole, which in Clark County was 6.5 percent. The construction sector is among the hardest-hit in terms of job loss. And home values in Las Vegas dropped 31.7 percent in 2008, second most in the nation behind Phoenix, according to a recent Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s report.</p>
<p>So there are several factors related to high concentrations of immigrants, each somehow related to another.</p>
<p>As Kochhar wrote, &#8220;the presence of immigrants in a county may simply signal the effects of a boom-and-bust cycle that has raised foreclosure rates for all residents in that county.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Foreclosures and High Concentrations of Immigrants Somehow Related&#8221;</p>
<p>You bet. You bet they are. In California farming communities, in Las Vegas, Nevada, all thourghout Southern California in the 1990&rsquo;s, developers built hundreds of thousands of houses and those houses were almost immediately occupied by hispanics, mostly illegal aliens. It was kind of like when grass, suddently has dozens of mushrooms on it that weren&rsquo;t there the night before. </p>
<p>This was all planned. This was all planned by the U.S. government. It was accepted by the mainly Southwest States and never investigated. But in any case, it was all planned. As I wrote on a previous posting, the plan is to fill the United States with the third world, and to send the riches and capital of the United States to the rest of the third world. The plan has been ongoing for at least two decades and it is still going strong, since the Obama administration is doing zilch about the borders. Mexicans, for example, did not just come to the U.S. and suddently find new housing to move into that they could in no way afford. It was planned and done for them. Americans are simply too asleep to notice any of it, and many don&rsquo;t give a care, anyway.</p>

			<p>Crime is completely out of control here in Las Vegas. Yesterday a White male who is a waiter at Caesar&rsquo;s Palace was beaten to death. His bloody body was found behind one of the Strip&rsquo;s oldest hotels. The foreclosures and unemployment are intertwined with the extreme violence.</p>

<p>If the policy to give homes to minorities who couldn&rsquo;t pay for them had been written about in an investigative report 5 years ago and posted here, many posters to this site would have responded by warning that it was a recipe for disaster, and that coming unavoidable defaults would be devestating for this country.</p>
<p>Likewise, past reports of black inability to learn and the achievement gap WERE responded to on this forum by forecasting that the achievement gap would never close, because blacks have hit their pinnacle so far as intellect is concerned.  We were right about that.  </p>
<p>We were right that black crime wouldn&rsquo;t decrease, but only get worse.  We were right that all pathologies in the black community would worsen.  We were right by warning that too many illiterate immigrants from Latin America would dumb down the country and reduce the wages to a point where it would be hard for some to earn enough to support a family.</p>
<p>We were also right in saying that blacks and Hispanics would be fighting and killing each other more so with each passing year, and we were right about that.</p>
<p>Now many are saying that this country is headed for breakup, along lines of politics, race, and ethnicity, and we will be right about that, also.  We will be proven right about this present economy tanking to the point where it will cause the aforementioned  break up.</p>
<p>Why am I so confident we will be proven right, about the things we warned of that haven&rsquo;t yet occurred?  Well, it isn&rsquo;t because we have ESP oracles posting on here.  </p>
<p>Quite simply, it&rsquo;s so easy to see almost any intelligent person would arrive at the same conclusions, if he could reach an objective state of mind before considering all the evidence.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re converging to a point of conflict.  That&rsquo;s a universal observation that has occurred under similar circumstances for thousands of years.  And one other thing.  Human nature hasn&rsquo;t changed one iota in all that time.</p>

			<p>A link between lots of foreclosures and large numbers of immigrants? How much rocket science intelligence did it take to come up with that conclusion. Anyone smarter than a retarded turnip could have explained that to our economics whiz kids.</p>

<p>One more example of the irrelevancy and idiocy of the msm.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll print a stupid story warning caution about connecting home ownership and loans given to those who in no way (and had no intention) of paying them back with innocent &#8216;minorities.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Of course, the msm would NEVER print Steve Sailor&rsquo;s article, &#8220;The Minority Mortgage Meltdown (contd.): How The Community Reinvestment Act Fits In&#8221;  which explains clearly and concisely, backed by hard data,  why lending large amounts of money to the irresponsible was such a bad idea  &mdash;  and oh yeah!  The vast majority of those who were &#8216;given&rsquo; these loans &#8216;just happened&rsquo; to be minorities (in California, in most areas, that would be WHITES)  &mdash;  especially innocent immigrants.</p>
<p>According to everything I&rsquo;ve read/heard in the msm, it&rsquo;s all the evil White bankers&rsquo; fault  &mdash;  they knowingly gave out these loans, and with evil intentions.  Therefore, they must forfeit their businesses to the government!</p>
<p>Not one word about the REAL reasons behind the meltdown  &mdash;   CRI and ACORN, with the complicit backing of government force.</p>
<p>May the Internet Live Long and Prosper!!  (Can you tell I just saw the new Star Trek movie?).</p>

			<p>I recall I started reading articles about the housing bubble almost four years ago.  Typically mentioned in these articles was real-estate speculation that was driving prices up far faster than any reasonable rate, a construction industry that massively overbuilt - trying to cash in on the runaway real-estate inflation, and home loans that were given to people with miserable credit.</p>
<p>This was so predictable four years ago that I cashed out a bonds and mortgages account in a mutual fund I invest in, and probably avoided a major financial haircut.  If this was so predictable, Kochar&rsquo;s statement about a &#8220;chicken and egg situation&#8221; is only another multicultist saying &#8220;I am an idiot and I think you are an idiot, too.&#8221;  Of course the impending disaster was under the MSM&rsquo;s radar because they&rsquo;re not very bright people, and they don&rsquo;t tend to care too much about complicated things like money; they&rsquo;d rather report about where Madonna is adopting her new non-white fashion accessory, but the point is that the information was available - online - for anyone who cared to look for it, and in publications like the Wall Street Journal for any regular reader with enough insight to add up the clues from multiple articles.  Kochar is either wildly delusional or deliberately dishonest here; whichever the case, he clearly needs to find another line of work.</p>

<p>Actually, it was crooked hispanic loan brokers who gave out the mortgages to immigrants with no income.  The loans were then turned over to the banks.  The banks had no control over the loan brokers.</p>
