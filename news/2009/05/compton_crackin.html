			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jessica Garrison, Los Angeles Times, May 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Up and down Castlegate Avenue and other streets in East Compton, some of the garages show signs of the city&rsquo;s recent crackdown on blight. Some gleam with fresh coats of paint. Others have clearly undergone remodeling, with doors newly fitted into the frames.</p>
<p>This pleases Marlene Townes, a 45-year resident of Compton. She sees it as yet another sign of her city&rsquo;s transformation from nationwide symbol of urban violence and decay back into a proud, working-class city.</p>
<p>To Justa Ramirez and some of her neighbors, on the other hand, what has happened to their garages is an injustice with racial undertones that is taking money out of people&rsquo;s pockets at the worst possible time.</p>
<p>Compton is cracking down on garages that have illegally been converted into living spaces. That includes, according to city manager Charles Evans, as many as a third of all the residents&rsquo; garages, some of which house entire families who can&rsquo;t afford to rent a house or apartment. Others think the number could be even higher.</p>
<p>Compton, a city of about 93,000 south of Watts, is hardly unique. Across Los Angeles County, officials estimate that hundreds of thousands of people sleep each night in quarters originally built for automobiles  &mdash;  although they say it&rsquo;s impossible to know for sure how many because the units are, by their nature, hidden behind closed doors.</p>
<p>In a region with a deep shortage of affordable housing, officials have long struggled with what to do about illegal garage units. Strictly enforcing all building codes could result in tens if not hundreds of thousands of people pushed onto the street, according to housing experts. But it is not good public policy to have children and families living in unsafe units  &mdash;  especially ones that do not have proper fire exits.</p>
<p>Los Angeles officials are considering a different approach. City Council President Eric Garcetti said he planned to propose that one neighborhood participate in a voluntary pilot project to help residents bring illegal units up to code and get them properly permitted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Compton city officials, pointing to a 2007 fire that killed children living in a Long Beach garage, have said the converted garages pose a health and safety risk  &mdash;  and they have been putting liens on people&rsquo;s properties until they turn their garages back into spaces for cars or formally legalize them with building permits.</p>
<p>City officials say they don&rsquo;t know how many people have been cited, but said it has been hundreds.</p>
<p>In a city where tensions between blacks and Latinos have simmered for years, this has led to charges that the crackdown is not hitting the two populations equally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bennett [Anita Bennett, a communications consultant] also said officials do not want to make anyone homeless. &#8220;It is a question of liability,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If the city knows there is an illegal conversion and they do nothing, then the city is liable.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But other longtime Compton residents say that the huge numbers of converted garages create blight and parking problems, the last things the city needs as it tries to overcome a negative image arising from years of violent gang-related crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be better for people to not live in a garage,&#8221; [Monsignor John S. Woolway, administrator of Sacred Heart church in Compton,] said. But the bottom line, he said, is &#8220;people need a place to live.&#8221;<br>

			<p>&#8220;They dont want to make people homeless&#8221;. Their home is in Mexico.There s a lot of room for them there.I have seen places where there were tens of Mexican illegals living in one unit.The US does not owe anyone who is not here legally housing.</p>

			<p>This is not the first time that a government measure has been taken that seems sort of inane, but it doesn&rsquo;t take much digging to discover race, especially Hispanic.  Several years ago, Fairfax County, Virginia wanted to limit the number of people that slept in a bedroom, or it was something like that.  I didn&rsquo;t know what the deal was until the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) started complaining, then I figured out it, that it had to do with the Indoamerican propensity to cram-jam residential domiciles.</p>

			<p>This has been going on in Queens, NYC for decades w/South Asians from India and Guyana living in one-car garages.</p>
<p>And since many of these garages have no heat you can imagine how cold they are during winter. A garage on my block caught fire because the the Indian family living there used the bbq grill for heat.</p>
<p>At least Compton has warm weather.</p>

			<p>For quite some time now, certain areas in the Southwest have been degenerating to third world status.  This is just more of the same, and it&rsquo;s an indication that the problem is growing, and creeping deeper into the heartland as well.</p>
<p>As the economy continues to go deeper into depression, there will be an acceleration of these types of conversions. Tent cities on vacant lots are already up and running.  Next it will be storage units with two and three families in each one for about $120 per month.  For Mexicans used to living in a Mexican slum near the border, a storage unit is a class A condo. That&rsquo;s why I now think very few will return home.</p>

			<p>Garages are just one aspect of the problem.  Recently I have been looking to buy a nicer home in the Southern California area.  Some homes that once sold for $700k cannot now be sold for $400k because they have been thrashed by three and four families having lived in them.  Entire families take up one bedroom and convert it into a studio apartment. You can see the rust stains on the carpet where the refrigerators were stationed.</p>
<p>When the &#8220;boom&#8221; was going on, the realtors were advertising in Spanish that large homes would be affordable and ideal for two or three families.</p>
<p>More signs that we are becoming a third world banana republic.</p>

			<p>In a way, why focus on Compton. For those who don&rsquo;t know, it is a city a few miles from Los Angeles. We have dozens of cities surrounding Compton and they have allowed garage conversions by the thousands. Some examples would be Downey, Bellflower, Bell Gardens, South Gate, Pico Rivera, Lynwood, etc. etc. All of these cities once had strict zoning and building codes and were lawabiding places. Not today. As I have said for a hundred or more times,  almost any law the illegal alien Mexican population violates in California&rsquo;s cities, is ignored. Where it was once illegal to do this that or the other, it is now A OK. The reason is that too many Mexicans are in local government and don&rsquo;t care to bother their brethren, and whites in local government are too cowardly. Take my word for it, I&rsquo;ve watched it going on for years. It is breathtaking what the illegal alien population is allowed to get away with.</p>

<p>Lucas   &mdash;   this point had come up in a discussion from the other day about DC   &mdash;   about how the fate of suburban McMansions is going to be precisely this.  By and by, the new, outer suburbs will fill up with groups of Hispanics illegally subdividing the homes, and the neighborhood will turn into a slum.  California is leading the way in this regard, since it&rsquo;s been so overbuilt over the last several years, but it&rsquo;s happening to the rest of the country too.</p>

			<p>I have been warning about this for years, that once minority immigrants move in to an area, they will change the laws to accommodate their third world ways, until our country has been totally transformed into a third world country. In addition, they will use the lie of racial profiling as a means to guarantee their success in the transformation of all first world laws and rules of ethics.<br>

			<p>This is not a new issue for southern California.  We are only hearing about it because of the racial tension underlying it.  My cousin once lived in a converted garage in a white neighborhood on the prestigious west side of L.A.  It was a pretty nice apartment too.  The only drawback was that headlights shined right in the living room when a car parked in the driveway.</p>

			<p>   Anyone seen Slumdog Millionaire? The slum scenes are very graphic. It seems that L.A. is about halfway there.5 more years of unfettered invasion,L.A. will be a giant fetid slum.</p>

<p></p>
<p>That is a complete oversimplification describing the situation of converted garages. Yes, there have been people who have violated zoning and building codes, even when California was 90 percent white. But this has been few and far inbetween. Their is undoubtedly a racial element to the anger now but why? It is because it is totally out of control now. Whereas a converted garage formerly may have held a bachelor, or at most a couple, it now has 7-8 people living in it etc. Small narrow streets are inundated with cars on both sides, the privacy levels are zero and vital resources are stretched over the limit. That is why housing codes were created in the first place.<br>
No, the reason people are mad, very mad, now, is because of the total blight created by the overwhelming number of illegal aliens living  &mdash;  illegally. As always, illegal immigration is making the former laws a farce and void wherever it occurs on a large scale.</p>

			<p>I once saw one of these garage conversions when I was a student in Santa Cruz about 25 years ago.  Since Santa Cruz is far cooler in the winters than Compton, the &#8220;remodelling&#8221; job had included tacking corrugated cardboard to the walls and ceiling.  If you add a space heater to this environment, what you get is a lethal firetrap.</p>

<p>Glad to see I&rsquo;m not the only one from Richmond Hill here. Yup, they stuffed the garages with them, the, ahem, one-family houses (three families plus some other bums), the two-family&hellip;</p>
<p>One of my neighbors burned himself and his family up because of those religious candles. Remember when you rarely heard a fire engine or cop? After they showed up it was sirens all the time. I also remember when you could come home at 3 AM on a hot July Saturday night and, other than maybe a few errant teens or some people sitting on their stoop talking quietly, you could hear yourself breathing. Now you see those friggin&rsquo; blue tarps everywhere and they&rsquo;re all underneath blasting that godawful music. especially when there are weddings (the record once was 19 hours straight).</p>
<p>But hey, it&rsquo;s really nice to live in such a vibrant community of color. So much better than the old neighbors with their American flags flying (the racists!). Thank God those are gone&hellip;</p>

			<p>The S. California garage conversions are nothing to the San Francisco asian overcrowding.  There are 1,000 sq ft houses over a garage of the same size in San Francisco that house as many as 30 asians.  The garage is often used as a workshop for the family business, including food processing.  All without permits of course.</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t building inspectors object to illegal alien slaves slaughtering and cutting up chickens on a garage floor in a residential neighborhood?   Not if the building and zoning inspectors are all asians like those committing the zoning violations.</p>
<p>When I was looking to buy a house on Russian Hill, I was shown 4 houses occupied by asians who had converted the living room to barracks, 6 sets of triple decker bunks, meaning that 18 people slept in the living room.  Each of the bedrooms were obviously occupied by a couple and children, 4 or 5 people in each bedroom.<br>
With 3 bedrooms, that means at least 30 people lived in those 3 bedroom, 1,800 sq ft houses.</p>
<p>Most of the asians who have back yards have built illegal extensions out into the small city back yards, thus filling the entire lot with a building.  But no one may object to this, it wuld be racist.</p>

			<p>Remember that AFrican illegal alien family in New York City somewhere.  The man actually bought a 2 flat building.  He remodelled it into I think 6 separate apartments, 3some rental income and the others so each of his 3 wives and their kids could have a private cubicle.</p>
<p>The place caught fire because of his amateur electrical work.  The NYT &amp; other media sobbed and sobbed because one of the kids died in the fire.  NYFD was at first blamed for racist response to the fire. The New York Post (evil racist voice of White New Yokers) revealed the illegalities.  I think the guy was from Ghana. </p>

<p>What you described is incredible, but sadly, not unbelievable. It only goes to show that there is no leadership in this nation and that, sadly, it is probably too far gone to be saved. Unbelievable!! The only possible way of saving this nation is a no-confidence vote EN MASSE, for the whole Senate and Congress and a complete replacement of them both with new people. This of course will be impossible for a citizenry that can barely get off the couch to vote out just one scoundrel.</p>

			<p>Anonymous at 9:12 PM made another good point about these &#8220;remodelings&#8221;: none of the wiring is ever up to code, so one doesn&rsquo;t really need a space-heater for a fire to start.</p>
<p>I occationally see a local electrician&rsquo;s van on the road.  It has a bumper sticker that says &#8220;Electrical Work is Not a Hobby&#8221;.</p>

			<p>A point that also ought to be made is that many of these units being illegally remodeled are rentals.  When non-code, no-permit alterations are made to a building, it is difficult to sell later on.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working for a guy some weekends this year, helping him finish his basement.  He didn&rsquo;t get a permit.  Fortunately for him, the house plans filed with the city already say &#8220;finished basement&#8221;, and he&rsquo;s already an electrician, so the wiring is up to code (I&rsquo;m just doing the carpentry and sheetrock work.)  If his plans didn&rsquo;t already say &#8220;finished basement&#8221;, he&rsquo;s have to rip all that stuff out if he and his wife ever wanted to sell their house.</p>
<p>Most of the skilled trades have very subtle tricks one must know.  I&rsquo;ve seen amateur welding, for instance, in which the mill scale was not removed prior to the weld.  Mill scale will create internal porosity in a weld that will not be detected by visual inspection.  Of course, this part failed.  Of course also, the work was done by an illegal alien who either didn&rsquo;t know or didn&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t care if these people leave as a bag of ashes, dirt or on a bus, just so they leave. I remember Santa Cruz well, my sister still lives there and I visit when I can, but I no longer recognize the place. Santa Cruz Hotel and the Catalyst were great places to go, USED TO BE great places.</p>
