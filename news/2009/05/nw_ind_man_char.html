<h1>NW Ind. Man Charged in Fake Hate Crime</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, May 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police arrested a northwestern Indiana man on charges that he set a fire at his mother&rsquo;s home and tried to make look like a hate crime by spray-painting a racial slur on the garage door.</p>
<p>Portage police say 21-year-old Brandon Bennett argued with his mother late Thursday, then after she went to sleep painted the slur and used gasoline to set fire to her bedroom door just after midnight Friday.</p>

			<p>No photo or mention of race in the original article.  The Indianapolis Star made it clear several years ago that they don&rsquo;t want you to know the race of criminal suspects because they&rsquo;re afraid of white racism.  Which of course is much worse than violent crime.</p>

			<p>Thank the insurance companies for the crackdown on false hate crimes. The police must grovel to the blacks and grievance &amp; grudge keepers, but the insurance companies are free to act against fake hate crime.</p>

No doubt there&rsquo;s no system in place to amend the original police report.</p>
<p>This was listed as a &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; and it will forever remain on the books as one.</p>

			<p>I was surprised to see in the printed version of the local paper a picture of the perpetrator and he appears to be white. I think he is mentally challenged. He should have known that any claim of a black hate crime would be viewed with skepticism by the police and investigated vigorously.</p>

<p>Blacks seem to have a strange fascination with setting people (particularly their &ldquo;loved ones&rdquo;) afire in their sleep for revenge, and with covering their tracks via a hoaxed &ldquo;hate crime.&rdquo; I can understand the &ldquo;hate crime&rdquo; angle, as the media and political elites encourage such deviant behaviors through their fawning obsession with the mythological &ldquo;persecution&rdquo; of nonwhites in this country; however, the incinerating of family members in their sleep, always escapes me. Why is that such a preferred method of reprisal in the black &ldquo;community?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Is it is because fire still remains a new and unique discovery to most of them?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

			<p>The insurance companies are putting a stop to fake hate crimes. The police are totally handicapped by ADL, AJC, SPLC,NAACP etc, but the insurance companies are not.</p>
<p>Hate Crime Hoaxes</p>
<p>Hate crime hoaxes are rampant in our society today. They are almost completely unpunished, even though they should be punished similarly to the punishment that would have been given to the hate criminal. The perpetrator of a hate crime hoax, after committing the most egregious defamation against the diverse white American peoples that is possible, is given counseling, not a jail sentence.</p>
<p>The media seem to simply forget about hate crime hoaxes as they are exposed, and never inquire as to whether the next big hate crime story is a hoax. The alleged victim is always &#8220;believed&#8221; until it has become clear that he or she was simply attempting to defame the diverse white American peoples, and then the victim is forgiven by the dominant media culture, the formerly outraged politicians and college administrators, and the friends and supporters of the alleged victim.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, any alleged hate crime that meets these three criteria is frequently a hate crime hoax:</p>
<p>(1) There is no witness. </p>
<p>(2) There is a political or academic pay-off in terms of public recognition, pending criminal legislation, financial gain,such as insurance compensation or canceled tests.</p>
<p>(3) The criminal act is limited to writing, whether on the body of the alleged victim or on property. </p>
<p>There is now such a large number of documented hate crime hoaxes that the best way to learn about them is to go directly to the Google search engine (&#8220;Hate Crime Hoaxes&#8221;) to see its links to 155,000 items. This item count is accurate as of 12/19/08.<br>
 </p>
<p>Some Congressional testimony on hate crime hoaxes <br>
Testimony of Dennis Jay Executive Director, Coalition Against Insurance Fraud Judiciary Committee U.S. House of Representatives August 4, 1999. Quote:</p>
<p>Good morning and thank you for the opportunity to testify here today. My name is Dennis Jay and I&rsquo;m the Executive Director of the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud. We are a Washington, D.C.-based national alliance of public interest groups, government organizations and private insurance companies who are dedicated to fighting all forms of insurance fraud. We seek to curb fraud through public advocacy, consumer education and research. Our organization takes no position related to federal solutions to curb hate crime. </p>
<p>Our goal is to spot new or changing criminal behavior so law enforcement and victims can better prepare to counter these economic crimes, or at least be aware of them when they do occur. </p>
<p>In late 1997, our national data showed a small but certain rise in the number of arrests and convictions of people who stage hate crimes for the purposes of illegally collecting on insurance policies. These cases involved property damage to homes and cars, either by burning, defacing or damaging them in some other way. During the preceding years, our systems logged few, if any, of these types of cases. We perhaps saw one or two cases a year. </p>
<p>In 1998, we started logging one or two faked hate crimes a month. While these numbers still remain very small compared to the total number of reported hate crimes, it was enough for us to develop an initial inquiry into whether these few cases might be the beginning of a trend. </p>
<p>From our inquiries to law enforcement and insurance companies, there is some evidence to suggest that many more hate crimes may have been staged by alleged victims for either financial gain through insurance proceeds or to evoke community sympathy. The numbers are not great, but enough to raise concern about whether this crime will grow and what affect it could have on community response to real victims. </p>
<p>Effective deterrence includes thorough investigation by law enforcement and insurance companies to uncover any evidence that a hate crime might be staged. Insurance companies also should be encouraged to cooperate fully with law enforcement when they have a suspicious case. While hate crime victims should always be given the benefit of the doubt, insurers need to be ever vigilant to scam artists who prey upon the insurance system for financial gain. Public education also is a key to reinforce deterrence. These people need to understand that if they commit this crime, there&rsquo;s a good chance they will get caught. And if they get caught, they will be punished severely. Currently, there is a large minority of Americans who tolerate insurance fraud, and unfortunately, that seems to encourage a few to take the desperate act of staging fake hate crimes.<br>

			<p>Whenever the police discover that the perpetrator of a hate crime is also a member of the victim group, the police and the media drop it at once. This is wrong. The perpetrator should be prosecuted exactly the same way that a White Christian male would be.</p>

			<p>Actually there is nothing &#8220;fake&#8221; about &#8220;fake hate crimes&#8221;. They are done in an effort to increase hatred against the &#8220;oppressor&#8221; group. They stage the events to get the &#8220;victims&#8221;  to fear and hate the &#8220;oppressors&#8221; and to get the &#8220;oppressors&#8221; to feel more ashamed or afraid of a backlash against themselves, and thus to stop standing up for themselves.</p>

			<p> These people need to understand that if they commit this crime, there&rsquo;s a good chance they will get caught. And if they get caught, they will be punished severely.</p>
<p>Evidence in recent years suggest this is not true, at least the punishment part is not relative to &#8220;ethnic minorities&#8221;</p>

<p>Where in your link does it refer to any race, white or black?</p>
<p>Your &#8220;man bites dog,&#8221; analogy, &#8220;Bernie?&#8221;, is not logical.  There is NO parallel there even if the perp happened to be white.</p>
<p>What is the point of your post?  I mean, your link gave us no additional information than the above story. </p>
