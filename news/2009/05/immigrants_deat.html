<h1>Immigrant&rsquo;s Death May Be Labeled Hate Crime</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gary Martin, San Antonio Express-News, May 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Justice Department acknowledged Wednesday it has launched an investigation of the death of a Mexican immigrant in Pennsylvania to see if it should be prosecuted as a hate crime.</p>
<p>The Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Hispanic rights groups had been pressuring for such a probe after an all-white jury acquitted two teenagers on state charges of ethnic intimidation and third-degree murder, convicting them on a lesser charge of simple assault.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, D-San Antonio, said the CHC raised the Pennsylvania case with Attorney General Eric Holder during a meeting at the Justice Department.</p>
<p>Gonzalez is chairman of the CHC civil rights task force.</p>
<p>The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund has been assured that investigators &#8220;will make whatever determination is appropriate to make, regarding filing any federal civil rights violations,&#8221; said Henry Solano, MALDEF interim president and general counsel.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>MALDEF and the National Council of La Raza, which monitored the Pennsylvania case, want it reclassified as a hate crime.</p>
<p>Luis Ramirez, 25, an immigrant from Guanajuato, Mexico living in Shenandoah, Pa., was attacked on July 12, 2008 by six high school football players. He later died from injuries suffered in the beating.</p>
<p>Witnesses heard the assailants shout ethnic epithets at Ramirez during the late night attack.</p>
<p>Brandon Piekarsky, 17, and Derrick Donchak, 19, were later acquitted on the more serious charges.</p>
<p>Janet Murgu√≠a, NCLR president, said she was unsure why jurors acquitted the teens, whether the prosecution failed to prove its case or whether the credibility of other assailants, who were prosecution witnesses, was at issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last week, the U.S. House passed federal hate crimes legislation, 249 to 175. The bill, which would allow the Justice Department to assist local authorities in investigating and prosecutirng hate crimes, now goes to the Senate.</p>
<p>Latino rights groups said the legislation would help prosecute future cases of hate crimes against Hispanics and other minorities.</p>

						<p>
							<i>AP, May 5, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Two Pennsylvania teens acquitted of the most serious state charges in the beating death of a Mexican immigrant could still face federal charges.</p>
<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s civil rights division is reviewing evidence surrounding the fatal fight last summer between high school football players and illegal immigrant Luis Ramirez in predominantly white Schuylkill County, spokesman Alejandro Miyar said Tuesday.</p>
<p>A county jury last week acquitted Brandon Piekarsky, 17, of third-degree murder and ethnic intimidation and Derrick Donchak, 19, of aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation. Both were convicted of simple assault.</p>
<p>Both defendants are from the small, blue-collar town of Shenandoah, where the July 12 fight occurred when Ramirez, 25, was walking with a 15-year-old girlfriend and encountered a group of teens, at least some of whom had been drinking.</p>
<p>The case has exposed racial tensions in the area, which has attracted Hispanic immigrants in search of farm and factory work. Ramirez moved to the town about seven years ago from Iramuco, Mexico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another defendant, Colin Walsh, pleaded guilty to a federal civil-rights charge before trial and testified at trial, admitting he threw a punch that knocked Ramirez unconscious. He could be out of prison in four years. Another defendant, 18-year-old Brian Scully, is charged juvenile court with aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The simple assault convictions carry possible one- to two-year prison term. Sentencing has not been scheduled. Donchak was also convicted of corruption of minors and an alcohol charge.</p>
<p>Immigration-rights advocates attended the trial on behalf of Ramirez&rsquo;s family, and later called for federal charges.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luis&rsquo;s death reflects a steady increase of hate crimes targeting Latinos,&#8221; said Gladys Limon, a staff attorney with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. &#8220;This drastic rise of hate crimes against Latinos must be addressed by the new administration and Congress.&#8221;<br>

			<p>&#8220;White kids have to be guilty of a hate crime, they just have to be.&#8221; </p>
<p>Yeah, they do. As some of the posters on this forum have pointed out it&rsquo;s even more serious than that, since just being white makes you guilty of a hate crime.</p>

<p>Yep. Hate crimes against minorities and perceived hate crimes against minorities. But what of hate crimes against whites?</p>

While I know this isn&rsquo;t true in it&rsquo;s purest definition, this is a way around our former protection of double jeopardy.</p>
<p>In the alleged advancement of &#8216;civil rights&rsquo;, we can not be tried again and again until we&rsquo;re convicted of something. All in the name of &#8216;justice&rsquo;.</p>

			<p>Is it just ME or do they NEVER pursue this type of justice when it is blacks or hispanics torturing, raping and killing whites?<br>
Why is there such a Push On to protect this minority or that minority? Should the rules be don&rsquo;t do these evil things to ANYONE, PERIOD.</p>

			<p>Reminds me of the double jeopardy trial of the officers who apprehended the dangerous drug addicted, drunk Rodney King who was driving over 100 miles per hour in a 25 mile per hour zone.</p>
<p>They were found innocent retried inviolation of double jeopardy and imprisoned.</p>
<p>Luckily, the hispanics are probably not citizens thus cannot pack the Jury.</p>

<p>Many differing points of view on this case.</p>
<p>I know it has no bearing on the case but&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;when Ramirez, 25, was walking with a 15-year-old girlfriend&#8221;</p>
<p>He also has a &#8220;fiancee&#8221; with two kids? </p>
<p>Only one article refers to his residence status - that would be illegal for 6 years.</p>

			<p>As a Australian, I am a bit ignorant to American law. In Australia, if you are tried for murder and are found innocent, then you can never EVER be tried for that murder again in any capacity. Anything less would be considered double jepardy and would go against the entire basis of the western criminal code. Am I to assume that in the Untied States you have only a partial double jepardy law? The question I pose is a serious one. If anyone knows then reply.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right, but the technicality being used here is of the jurisdiction.  They can never be charged with the *state* criminal charges that they were vindicated of for the incident which generated the charges.  But they could be charged in the Federal system with something relating to that incident.  If they are found not guilty of that, then they can&rsquo;t be charged Federally with those charges relating from that incident again.</p>
<p>It would be like if an incident in Sydney, NSW, Australia brought both state (New South Wales) and Federal charges.</p>
<p>Now, even though it technically violate the letter of dub/jep, I think it violates the spirit of dub/jep.</p>

			<p>Hate crimes, open borders, self defense(gun control), repeat criminal offenders, increased taxation, are all part of destroying European Americans. Why? Because European Americans are the last obstacle to complete domination by the New World Order. Things are only going to get worse. We are to be destroyed by attrition. The murderous criminals and gangs are doing the dirty work of the globalist. Yes, there is a strategy behind all this so called insanity.</p>

			<p>I love how yet again 9/10ths of the newspapers that post this story are leaving out the fact that the mexican kept the fight going by running up and suckerpunching one of the teenagers in the back of the head after they had already walked away.  After he had called in his friends, of course.</p>

As an American, I don&rsquo;t understand it either. I am completely perplexed at how they get around this prohibition.  We are supposed to have guarantees against Double Jeopardy - at least we once did. But since the Civil Rights mania overtook this country a few decades ago, they now manage to find loopholes and technicalities to get what they want anyway. It seems they can bend the law as much as they want to, when they&rsquo;re in control.<br>

			<p>Unfortuantely for the accused, they just became a source of votes for Obama and Holder. </p>
<p>Obama has done nothing for blacks other than the tax cut for people who don&rsquo;t pay taxes now. Most blacks are too dumb to realize this and may never get the money if they don&rsquo;t file a return. But they will hear on the street or on their r and b radio that Obama is going after white &#8220;racists&#8221;. They will like that. </p>
<p>After all, in two years, with most blacks unemployed or underemployed, and inflation, caused by Obama and his white Harvard advisors, surging, Obama will need some white meat to throw to the black masses to get them to he polls.  All about &#8220;change&#8221;, right?</p>
<p>These will not be the last white &#8220;civil rights&#8221; scapegoats the Obama thought police will find to throw to the Latin and black masses. </p>

			<p>&#8220;investigation of the death of a Mexican immigrant in Pennsylvania to see if it should be prosecuted as a hate crime.&#8221;<br>
Here&rsquo;s how the investigation goes. Find suspects. Determine race/ethnicity of suspects. If White/anglo, go on evening news crowing that suspects have been found and they are White/anglo. The media and the race pimps will then take care of the evidence and conviction.<br>

			<p>Are they going to charge the illegal alien for staturtoru rape, corruption of minors, or any of those charges that a 25 year old &#8220;man&#8221; gets charged with when they have a 15 year old girlfriend? Maybe those sex crimes will be overlooked because that sort of thing is just part of &#8220;their culture&#8221; that we whites don&rsquo;t understand?<br>
I&rsquo;m just saying&hellip;</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know about Pa., but in Michigan there is the saying, &#8220;15 will get you 20&#8221;.  It refers to the &#8220;age of consent&#8221;, which in Michigan is 16.  If a 25 year old has a 15 year old &#8220;girlfriend&#8221;, he is supposed to be in major trouble with the law. </p>
<p>Then again, so are any foreigners who are in the country without permission.  And yet, all the authorities will busy themselves with is crucifying the white boys, by whatever means it takes- constitutional or not.  As are the so-called &#8220;rights groups&#8221;, who openly state that their aim is to prosecute white people for crimes against non-whites, rather than the non-whites who are by far the leading contributors to our crime problem.  Their aim is clear, and it has nothing to do with respect for the law or justice:  they are out to destroy white peoples&rsquo; lives!  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for protecting those illegal &#8220;immigrants&#8221; from violent citizens, though: by getting them back home where they belong, without delay! </p>

			<p> It&rsquo;s just a clever, shabby lawyer&rsquo;s trick. They didn&rsquo;t manage to convict you on the original charge, so they just change the wording a little and, presto! it&rsquo;s a brand-new charge: &#8220;Violating their civil rights.&#8221; What that means is, &#8220;You think you dodged the bullet, White boys, but we&rsquo;ve got another one all waiting and ready for you, and we&rsquo;re going to keep re-loading and firing until we get you, with one charge or the other.&#8221;</p>
<p> Plus, if someone suggests it&rsquo;s &#8220;double jeopardy,&#8221; the feds under the Mulatto Messiah can say, &#8220;Oh, no, no! They were found not guilty of (fill in the blank). This is a totally separate and different charge!&#8221; And everybody knows that&rsquo;s just a load of codswallop. But to their ilk, that doesn&rsquo;t matter: What matters is to get those White kids, by hook or by crook!</p>

			<p>I guarantee you, the Federal PC Police are chomping at the bit to collar these White boys with so-called &#8220;Hate Crimes&#8221;. </p>
<p>As another commenter stated earlier, if is CLEARLY double-jeopardy if they try and pull a &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221; out of their hat to nail these kids. I&rsquo;m sure they were very confidant that they would be convicted at the State/local level, and surprise, surprise, someone had some common sense left and didn&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>Our Federal government had become an enemy of the common people.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m afraid the &#8220;double jeapordy&#8221; law here in the US does NOT prevent someone from being tried separately for different aspects of the same crime.  While the defendants have been acquitted of murder, the criminal alien pedophile sympathizers are saying they may have violated Ramirez&rsquo;s civil rights.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a real case here.  The prosecutor would have to prove to a jury that Ramirez was attacked only because he was a Mexican, rather than because he was a loudmouth who yelled racial epithets and who wanted a fight as well.</p>
<p>Will a grand jury indict Piekarsky and Donchask?  Probably.  A grand jury would indict the lunch I ate today for the Kennedy assassination.  Since these guys have already shown they have the stones to take a case to trial, I doubt the local feds will bother.</p>

			<p>To SCV, yes it is true that whites are being targeted for destruction by the NWO.  This is happening in the USA as well as other western nations.</p>
<p>One part of the problem has to do with our liberal immigration policies and the other part has to do with the liberal justice system.  The liberal immigration system concocted by the Democrats and led by Ted Kennedy in 1965 was designed to make whites a minority over time.  The messed up justice system that we have today became dysfunction due to fifty years of persistent effort by the ACLU.  Many judges are actually members of the ACLU as is Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the Supreme Court justices. Other judges are not actual members of the ACLU but are of the same far left ideology.  When you think high crime, think Democrat politicians.  The communist front groups are all nicely nestled in the Democrat party as well.  BE very, very careful before you vote for a Democrat.  Remember how many foolish people have voted for Obama because he has a nice charming personality and seemed so moderate when he was playing to the cameras?  </p>

			<p>re: Robert-</p>
<p>The US does not allow double jeopordy.  There is the state( ie. one of the 50 states} and then there is the federal government. The 50 states are under the federal government. One can face state charges or federal government charges, though with crime, this seldom happens. Usually if a crime is committed, it is prosecuted by the state only. If the state, say the state of Texas, charges you with murder and you are acquitted, then no, you cannot be tried for murder again, either by the state or the federal government. However, the federal government can step in if you are acquitted and charge you with another crime related to the incident, say civil rights violations or a hate crime. As long as the charge is not murder, the federal government  can charge you with something else. </p>

			<p>&#8221; &ldquo;Luis&rsquo;s death reflects a steady increase of hate crimes targeting Latinos,&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t targeted because he was Latino. The boys yelled to Luis&rsquo; 15-year-old girlfriend that she was out a little late. Luis went bezerk on the boys and started cursing them and challenging them and calling his friends to fight. They got into a brawl and Luis got killed. I&rsquo;m not condoning what happened but he was a brawl that escalated and got out of hand, not targeting someone becuase he&rsquo;s Latino. Whites are beaten and killed by Blacks and Hispanics, especially Blacks, at much much higher rates than the reverse but these are NEVER prosecuted as hate crimes, no matter how brutal they are.</p>

			<p>The notion that motivation for a crime should affect the judgment of guilt or innocence and/or the sentence is a incredible perversion of the most basic tenets of our justice system.</p>
<p>Now we have murders, assaults, and robberies, and socially reprehensible murders, assaults, and robberies, the latter of which must be punished much more severely should it be suspected that the perpetrator was a racist, sexist, or some other ist.</p>
<p>This is a attempt to criminalize thoughts as opposed to actions and places us on the road to murderous thought-control.</p>

			<p>Having lived around blacks and hispanics I have seen and heard them talk trash and also physically fight.  Guess what epithets are being voiced. Do they hate one another? I guess so by government standards. </p>
<p>What a freak show our governments have become; all by design our laws (government) and entertainment industry cheapens our very existence with thought police and actual police putting us inside mental internment camps.</p>

			<p>If there is a federal prosecution for &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; or &#8220;violation of civil rights,&#8221; then someone reasonably close to the case geographically should think about starting a legal defense fund.  The lefties would do at least as much for one of their own who was being subjected to double jeopardy.</p>

			<p>If this were an election year (like 1992) and if this case received the national airplay that Rodney King did; then a civil rights case would ensue. </p>

			<p>  I don&rsquo;t know about Pa., but in Michigan there is the saying, &ldquo;15 will get you 20&rdquo;. It refers to the &ldquo;age of consent&rdquo;, which in Michigan is 16. If a 25 year old has a 15 year old &ldquo;girlfriend&rdquo;, he is supposed to be in major trouble with the law.<br>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>
Maybe I&rsquo;m getting up in years and am just old-fashioned, but I was not aware that merely having a (quote) &#8220;girlfriend&#8221; carried any implication of sex being involved anywhere in the picture. When I grew up, that certainly was not so!  A girlfriend was just that, not a wife. After all, he and she weren&rsquo;t married, they were just talking in the park. Is there any law against talking?  Does talking to a 15 year old constitute Statutory Rape???  Anyway, I thought her SISTER was his &#8220;girlfriend&#8221;?  Unless he could have multiple girlfriends from the same family???  Very bizarre.  As I said, this whole messsed-up thing leaves me confused. </p>
<p>Also, the notion that one person would provoke a fight with SIX husky young men and would attack them seems highly improbable. I think we WN&rsquo;s should take pains to pick our battles more carefully, and I don&rsquo;t think that this is a good one to get involved in. Furthermore, kicking someone in the head when he&rsquo;s down and unconscious in completely indefensible.  Just like those lacross players in North Carolina, it seems that nobody in this case was a saint. They all have a bad smell. I&rsquo;ll stay out of it.</p>

			<p>The notion that motivation for a crime should affect the judgment of guilt or innocence and/or the sentence is a incredible perversion of the most basic tenets of our justice system. <br>
This is a attempt to criminalize thoughts as opposed to actions and places us on the road to murderous thought-control.<br>

I share your concern about the frightening specter of &#8220;thought crimes&#8221;, but the fact is that intent and awareness have always been essential elements in determining the severity of a crime or incident.   </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, for example, what distinguishes a murder from manslaughter.  Or an accident from a crime.</p>

			<p> In Australia, if you are tried for murder and are found innocent, then you can never EVER be tried for that murder again in any capacity. </p>
<p>OVER HERE we have a clever thing called &#8220;Wrongful Death&#8221; it is usually used to circumvent a jury&rsquo;s INNOCENT verdict and imprison the chosen victim. As &#8220;contempt of court&#8221; A rich person (or politician/mafioso) can use the 5th ammendment and get away with it, if a poor person uses it, they can be held in contempt FOREVER!! Pretty clever legal system we have here, Right!</p>

			<p>julie, I love your post. It covers very profoundly, and concisely, how the legal system in the U.S. has been co-opted by radical leftists, and Democrats. You put it well and I wish people would read and think deeply about your message. It describes present day America&rsquo;s dilemma precisely. Thank you.</p>

			<p>It is really amazing how all the Hispanic &#8220;rights&#8221; groups are up in arms over this case but yet when a white was killed in Hazleton -which is 15 minutes away- by a bunch of illegal Hispanics which prompted Mayor Barletta&rsquo;s IIRA the Hispanics were up in arms how they were &#8220;victims&#8221; of Barletta&rsquo;s &#8220;racism&#8221; then.  Of course, nothing was said by them about the killing of the white who was shot in cold blood.  They always want to play the &#8220;victim&#8221; crying &#8220;civil rights&#8221; and &#8220;hate&#8221; but yet Hispanics are nothing but invaders in the United States trying to take over.  Had this Mexican not been in PA to begin with and had stayed in his OWN country he&rsquo;d still be alive.  He got what he deserved!  </p>

			<p>As unwanted, unwelcome and unneeded culturally incompatible Mexicans continue to swarm across our boarder in their bid to colonize this nation, the level of violence against them will escalate proportionately until it reaches ethnic cleansing proportions&hellip; </p>

			<p>Jenna 6 thugs attack a white student and cry racism, get off after a media frenzy. Teens defend themselves and media declares it to be murder because of racism. <br>
   Anyone see the pattern?<br>

			<p>&#8220;The liberal immigration system concocted by the Democrats and led by Ted Kennedy in 1965 was designed to make whites a minority over time.&#8221; <br>

<p><br>
Maybe it was concocted by certain Democrats, but let me disagree on one major point.  I do not think you could say it was &#8220;led by Ted Kennedy&#8221;.   More likely, that soused up boozer was led BY them and was barely aware of what he was doing. </p>

<p>Sounds pretty Orwellian to me.  Wonder when such a &#8220;task force&#8221; will start knocking on doors and performing neighborhood sweeps&hellip;       </p>

			<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard,and you probably haven&rsquo;t because MSM will not report it The chigger in the Lacrosse case admitted that she lied,no one issued an apology to the players.Yes talking to a 15 year old can get you in big trouble if you are 25,look at the number of people that has been arrested for talking to you girls on the net.They can call it coercion.</p>
