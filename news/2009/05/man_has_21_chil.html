			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amber Miller, WVLT-TV (Knoxville, Tennessee), May 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On paper, he has 20 possibly 21 children.</p>
<p>With a minimum wage job, he can&rsquo;t afford to support them all.</p>
<p>What is the state to do?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hatchett&rsquo;s children range in age from newborn 11.</p>
<p>There are at least 11 mothers; probably several more.</p>
<p>Constitutionally, there is nothing the state can do to limit him from having more.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Friday, his name appeared on the docket 11 times; Representing about 15 of his 21 children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hatchett&rsquo;s name is pretty controversial at the old courthouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;The children can&rsquo;t be supported all by Desmond, so the state of Tennessee has had to step in,&#8221; Hatchett&rsquo;s attorney Keith Pope said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your tax dollars at work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s due process  &mdash;  the state is only allowed to take 50% of Hatchett&rsquo;s paycheck.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 50% split multiple times.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, Hatchett says the women knew what they were getting into.</p>
<p>They were all aware of his large family.</p>
<p>One said, she doesn&rsquo;t like it but she deals with it. &#8220;It&rsquo;s about the kids. Not the parents,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t intend to have this many. It just happened,&#8221; Hatchett said.</p>
<p>Desmond Hatchett spent part of Friday afternoon jailed while a child support referee decided how to split up the $400 he brought to court.</p>
<p>If he doesn&rsquo;t pay what he owes, he will go back to jail because he is on an automatic jail order.</p>

			<p>St. Louis can beat that.  A north St. Louis County gas station owner (black) had to dispatch a local thug (black) several years ago.  The Post-Dispatch story about the matter mentioned in passing the he (the owner) had 31 children by 20 women.  He himself is one of 23 children of his mother by a number of fathers.</p>

			<p> What a joke! The height of irresponsibility! He has a minimum-wage job, and 21 children by 11 different mothers? Here&rsquo;s my suggestion: Either give him a court-ordered vasectomy, or keep him in jail without bond until he&rsquo;s too old to function sexually any more! At least then the taxpayers won&rsquo;t have to pay for any results of further foolishness on his part.</p>
<p> My grandfather sired 13 children, but they were all by my grandmother; and he supported them by farming and preaching. That&rsquo;s called &#8220;responsible parenthood.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This is one case where I agree where the &#8220;father&#8221; should be put in prison for &#8220;Non-support&#8221;, probably won&rsquo;t slow his sex life down all that much but at least he won&rsquo;t spawn anymore of these &#8220;precious children&#8221; that will be a burdon to socoity.</p>

<p>Of course about the kids&hellip;and how much money the state will give her for them. AND!! this jewel,<br>
 &#8220;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t intend to have this many. It just happened,&rdquo; Hatchett said&#8221; I wonder what he thought would happen, but we know he didn&rsquo;t think of that at all.</p>

			<p>Blacks place a very low value on each individual child harkening back to living in africa where high fertility was needed for survival. That same instinct uncorked in a Western country produces multiple bastard offspring on a large scale. Welfare and &#8220;community services&#8221; will no doubt ensure all the needs of the children and their mothers will be met. Whites surrender their entire lives for sake of a few children and give everything to them. The difference couldn&rsquo;t be more stark.</p>

<p>Despite his pioneering work as a fertility doctor, I&rsquo;m sure that this budding &#8220;genius&#8221; qualifies for a free state-provided mandatory vasectomy under the old legal standard.</p>

			<p>Disgusting!  I probably make less than this dingbat, but own my own home and have one child with one woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t intend to have this many.  It just happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is idiotic.  Does this mean he wasn&rsquo;t having intercourse with these women?  The rest of us not only know how kids are created, but we have mastered the strange and mysterious arts of birth-control.  </p>
<p>At least jail will make it more difficult for Hatchett to produce more.</p>

			<p>Stories like this make me wonder&hellip;.since so many black women have multiple children by multiple men that means the black community has a heck of alot of &#8220;half-siblings&#8221; who are raised in different households.  I wonder how many of those &#8220;half-siblings&#8221; end up mating?  And could that be an explanation for why mental retardation/learning disabilities seem to disproportionately affect blacks?</p>

			<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t have this problem if there was no government welfare entitlement.  </p>
<p>Hatchett should be castrated and sold to some African tribe as a slave, just like every other black who cannot take care of himself or refrain from crime.  His &#8220;baby mommas&#8221; should also be dealt with, especially if they are White.</p>
<p>If you really want to get the public concerned about Hatchett, just drop a hint that he&rsquo;s really a Mormon.  Whites aren&rsquo;t afraid to castigate Mormons.</p>

			<p>Hey, I like to give credit where credit is due.  </p>
<p>Demond, much respect to you for working a minimum-wage job even though you are taking home $2 an hour.  </p>
<p>That ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; much, but it&rsquo;s something.</p>

			<p>The reality is that his 20+ children will be supported by you and I through WIC, SSI, AFDC, Medicare, Foodstamps, and any number of other &#8220;programs&#8221;.  Think about what that means.  He breeds.  You pay.  He breeds more, you pay more.  You pay more, you breed less.  Pretty soon, the future looks more like him and less like you.</p>
<p>In no way do I wish to support the bastard offspring of this reprobate, and if that means that they starve - tough.  I honestly don&rsquo;t care.  The little tyke&rsquo;s baby-mamas should have thought of that prior to coupling with this swine.  I have no sympathy for them either.</p>
<p>And how many of this louse&rsquo;s spawn will end up doing the same thing - siring untold numbers of bastards?  How many will become menaces to the rest of us - thieves, rapists, and killers?  I&rsquo;d place the odds as pretty high.</p>
<p>To take from Me and Mine in order to give to Him and His is theft.  But it&rsquo;s actually worse than mere theft.  It diminishes the long-term life-prospects of my family in order to increase those of his family.  It is a kind of soft genocide.</p>

<p>Contrary to what you might think with all the media&rsquo;s obsession over our vaunted first lady, Black women are not highly desired even by their own men. </p>
<p>A few sweaty minutes in the sack with a fine specimen like this winner here is about the best a lot of them can hope for. They probably forgo the prophylactics at the gentleman&rsquo;s insistence.  <br>

<p>That means he has 21 times as many genes as you in just the next generation!  So far!  (And who knows how many times more in generations thereafter?).  </p>
<p>Indeed, the poor shall inherit the earth.  And that is why this country is inevitably sliding downhill.  Civilization contains the seeds of its own destruction; civilization is a self-destructing phenomenon. Civilizations burn themselves out when their creative gene pool is exhausted.  </p>
<p>But his great-grandchildren will be demanding aid from your great-grandchildren, and preaching guilt while threatening violence.  And whatever yours produce will go to his.</p>

			<p> A few years ago, I read an article about the &#8220;20 / 20  club&#8221;. The goal of the club members was to have 20 children by 20 different women. The club members were all black males and started fathering children at a very young age.</p>

			<p>Please support higher local, state, and Federal Taxes.  There are so many poor children who are disadvantaged in our communities.  This article is just one example   &mdash;   these 21 innocent children   &mdash;   all of them without a father.  We need to dig deep into our pockets to help these kids.  I realize that it is tough for you to pay more taxes, especially in these difficult economic times.  For you White people out there, you should consider getting a second job, living in a smaller house, not heating your home in the winter, or not having children.  By not having children, you can save more money to contribute to taxes to help Demond&rsquo;s 21 children.  Remember, that across America, there are tens of thousands of similar cases, and as we continue massive immigration from Mexico, Haiti, and Africa, we can expect many, many more needy children.  </p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think there is a constitutional right to father so many children irresponsibly like that, and so I don&rsquo;t see why states can&rsquo;t pass laws limiting the number of children fathered out of wedlock with penalties for violators. Wish they would try - sure they would be taken to federal court on this law but I think the public would want to their state to try to stop this costly irresponsibility. </p>
<p>The real problem is that evidently there is absolutely no shame any more in the black community about out of wedlock children and multiple sex partners, and they probably feel they have the right to taxpayer&rsquo;s support for any number of illegitimate offspring they produce. Write you state representative.</p>

			<p>This is one of those great local stories that lends itself to all kinds of &#8220;code words&#8221; politics.</p>
<p>A White candidate can run on a platform of &#8220;Welfare reform&#8221; to limit men from fathering more than 8 children they can not support.</p>
<p>A 70s TV Show was called &#8220;8 is Enough&#8221;. Political campaigns can feature welfare reform where &#8220;8 is enough&#8221; - no specific race is mentioned, but some critics will say these are &#8220;Code Words&#8221;.</p>
<p>Local candidates can win power for our side using&hellip;..</p>
<p>Code words.</p>

<p>It would have been a lot cheaper to just pay for his sterilization than for 21 kids. The state should offer free sterilizations for poor minorites. Perhaps we could sell some liberals on the idea if we market it just right.</p>

			<p>Twenty-one children at $400/month, that&rsquo;s $4,800/year, and for, let&rsquo;s say, 28 years of support, assuming all children have been born within the last ten years, will be a total of $134,400 to support 21 kids for their entire childhoods (0-18).</p>
<p>The average white family, by contrast spends about $204,000 to raise ONE child to adulthood.  If the kid gets into a good college, tack on another 120 grand to that bill.</p>
<p>As far as passing the maximum amount of his genes on for the smallest cost, I&rsquo;d say this guy is a winner!</p>

			<p>1. Welfare is to be used to feed people who really need the food. If you do not sign a statement claiming that you have not had sex in the past 2 months you should not get welfare.  Recieiving welfare while having recently had sex, or lying on that statement should be prohibited by law.  It takes energy to have sex. Energy comes from the food you eat. When someone has sex while on welfare they are wasting money that should be used to feed the poor.</p>
<p>2. It should be a crime to risk reproduction with someone who is not likely to be able to support the child that may arise.  Having a child you cannot afford is very unpleasant.  We can prohibit sex to protect people from hurting themselves in this manner.  We already have laws against having sex with minors for the protection of the minor. Why not also have a law against having &#8220;pregnancy risking sex&#8221; with an adult who would be severely financially inconvenienced by such, if that adult were left alone to care for the child?</p>
<p>3. Perhaps the government would be forced to do something if enough of the self supporting people who do not receive public assistance went on strike  &mdash;   working just enough to live safely.<br>
If everyone started doing it all at once, in coordinated waves what would occur?</p>

			<p>Reply to Istvan:</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point and is something I have wondered about too.<br>
There are so many blacks out there who have no idea who their fathers are. There are undoubtedly a lot of unknown half-siblings in the black community. I&rsquo;m sure it plays a part in what you say.</p>

<p>I think I know the point you&rsquo;re trying to make, and I think you mean well, but in this instance, I think you&rsquo;re misguided.</p>
<p>There are very few jurisdictions in the United States the require you to get a license to own a gun.  If I had a dime for every real world person I hear say about &#8220;registering&#8221; a gun, I&rsquo;d be rich.  But it&rsquo;s not true   &mdash;   even fewer places require formal registration of guns.  It&rsquo;s the damned media and TV shows that have people fooled.</p>
<p>As far as drivers licenses, I&rsquo;m sure you got your drivers license from a DMV or Revenue Office or Dept. of Transportation Office whose authorities and driving test cops/highway patrolmen/women have standards.  In black jurisdictions, the standards are not so set in stone, nor are they very well followed.  Especially since they&rsquo;re state agencies, they hand out drivers licenses to blacks like candy, in fear of being called the dreaded r-word.  In St. Louis City, the Dept. of Revenue office that serves the heavily black northern part of the city is infamous for having black clerks that pass a written test even if you failed, and black male &#8220;Highway Patrolmen&#8221; that pass the driving field tests of black girls just because, or for other &#8220;considerations.&#8221;</p>
<p>If your idea of parental licensure actually came to be, people like Mr. Hatchett and all the members of his &#8220;harem&#8221; would get licenses, white right wingers, esp. &#8220;racists,&#8221; wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to have kids.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I wonder how many of those &ldquo;half-siblings&rdquo; end up mating? And could that be an explanation for why mental retardation/learning disabilities seem to disproportionately affect blacks?&#8221;<br>
Posted by Istvan</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting thought. But think it&rsquo;s far more likely that those natal disabilities are due to the mothers&rsquo; abuse of alcohol and drugs, which are both rampant among blacks. All three taken together do present a massive problem   &mdash;    all due to sheer, thoughtless improvidence, all of which is avoidable.<br>

			<p>I think that compulsory sterilization will be inevitable in the countries that are presently White.  The only question is who will be sterilized.</p>

			<p>This is a poster story that explains why multiculturism does not work. Now that USA has adopted foreign cultures the government had to develop  funding for the what was once irresponsible behavior.  The UNsustainable entitlements are biggest reason USA will have to succumb to socialism/communism.  When government adopted multiculturism/immigrations it subordinated USA social contract for foreign interests.    Agree with Stringtheorybob.<br>
There has never been a dialogue about the kind of government blacks want.  It sure does not look like white government. It appears most blacks want central government sponsorship. Our entire social structure/culture is torn apart by this behavior.   V</p>

			<p>I find the irresponsible behavior of the mothers more reprehensible! Woman that decide to have children but can&rsquo;t take care of them are the real problem. This guy just wanted to sex up any disgusting female me could.</p>
