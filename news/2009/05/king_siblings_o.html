<h1>King Siblings Oppose Film Deal Struck by Brother</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Errin Haines, AP, May 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>DreamWorks plans the first big-screen portrayal of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s life, the studio announced Tuesday, but two of King&rsquo;s children immediately threatened legal action because the film deal was brokered without their blessing.</p>
<p>DreamWorks touted the project in a press release as the first theatrical motion picture authorized by the estate using King&rsquo;s intellectual property, including copyrighted speeches and other works, as the basis for the film. Steven Spielberg was listed as a co-producer. {snip}</p>
<p>Dexter King, one of the late civil rights leader&rsquo;s sons, said in a press release that he hoped the movie would &#8220;be the definitive film&#8221; on his father&rsquo;s legacy. Two other King siblings  &mdash;  Bernice King and Martin Luther King III  &mdash;  said they had no input in the deal.</p>
<p>Dexter is the chairman and chief executive officer of King, Inc.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a deal that Mr. Spielberg and his people .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have entered into believing that they have the blessing of The King Estate. They don&rsquo;t have the blessings of Bernice and Martin King,&#8221; Bernice King told The Associated Press in a telephone interview on Tuesday after finding out about the deal in an e-mail from Dexter King.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The three siblings have been involved in several legal disputes regarding their parents&rsquo; intellectual property in the past year. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III have accused their brother of tarnishing their parents&rsquo; legacy with his business decisions, and say he has been operating The King Estate for years without their input.</p>
<p>Martin Luther King III said the matter was typical of an ongoing pattern of exclusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not that we are against a film,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s very interesting to me that a company would engage in a business arrangement knowing that there&rsquo;s severe controversy around many issues pertaining to the estate of Martin Luther King Jr.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In March, Dexter King brokered a deal with EMI Music Publishing for his father&rsquo;s words and image. Last month, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III took issue with an $800,000 licensing deal their brother struck with the foundation tasked with building a memorial to their father on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The siblings still haven&rsquo;t settled three lawsuits involving their parents&rsquo; estates, including one attempting to force Dexter King to open the books of their father&rsquo;s estate. Another would determine who should control Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s personal items  &mdash;  some of which were at the center of a $1.4 million book deal about their mother&rsquo;s life that fell apart last year.<br>

			<p>I hope the King family kills this golden goose, such that this movie never gets made.  I hardly think we&rsquo;re suffering from a lack of MLK movies.</p>

Will this film spark the black revolution just as X was supposed to do but didn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>The sooner this film is made, the sooner we can forget it.</p>

			<p>The film may never get made because the King &#8220;heirs&#8221; will fight like cats in a bag over the rights and money. It&rsquo;s probably a good thing anyway. Any version of a film on MLK would reek of political correctness and liberal whitewash  &mdash;  they&rsquo;d have the guy walking on water and raising people from the dead. It could be as nauseating a spectacle as his heirs squandering his legacy. </p>

			<p>Dreamworks had a done deal, and then two siblings come out of the woodwork to try to screw things up.  The siblings should watch their step.  I cite the Boxing Helena lawsuit, which resulted in a 8.1 million dollar judgment against Kim Basinger when she backed out of the movie, and resulted in her eventual bankruptcy.  I can see the same thing happening here.  The Dreamworks lawyers aren&rsquo;t dumb.  I&rsquo;m sure they made sure whomever they inked the deal with had authority to bind the King estate.  Dreamworks will take a dim view of siblings, without legal authority to act on behalf of the estate, trying to interfere with the movie.  Moviemaking is a big deal involving  millions of dollars.  Dreamworks is not going to sit still for being shaken down by this family. </p>

			<p>I hope this film will be made. I was looking forward to Brad Pitt playing MLK.</p>

			<p>Like Question Diversity I hope this film is strangled in its cradle by the endless greed of the King clan.</p>
<p>I recall a recent amren article detailing the King kids&rsquo; plan to sell their late parents&rsquo; love letters. How crass and tacky can you get?</p>
