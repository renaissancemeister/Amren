			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carrie Johnson, Washington Post, May 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.&rsquo;s emphatic public comments on racial equality since he took office have prompted several plaintiffs to ask the Justice Department to intercede in employment discrimination cases and civil rights disputes, according to interviews and court filings.</p>
<p>Among the most well known of the petitioners is Donald Rochon, who 20 years ago became the first black FBI agent to tangle publicly with the agency over racism within its ranks. Rochon ultimately won a landmark $1 million financial settlement after he blew the whistle to lawmakers about his alleged mistreatment. That opened the door for lawsuits by other black employees, which transformed the way the bureau handles discrimination complaints.</p>
<p>Now Rochon is again clashing with the FBI, this time in a complicated disagreement over his retirement benefits. Rochon and his lawyers have written Holder seeking help, citing the attorney general&rsquo;s February speech in honor of Black History Month in which he called for &#8220;a more open discussion&#8221; of race.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re hopeful that with a new administration, a new attorney general who in our view made a very courageous speech about race relations, that things will change for both Don and more broadly,&#8221; said Michael Rubin, a lawyer at Arnold &amp; Porter who is handling Rochon&rsquo;s case pro bono. &#8220;But we don&rsquo;t think that things will change on their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other people suing government agencies and contractors over alleged civil rights violations have also lodged similar requests, underscoring the lofty expectations for the nation&rsquo;s first black attorney general.</p>
<p>For example, lawyers for a defense contracting company asked the Justice Department to intervene and support them with court briefs in an appeals court case. They want to overturn a lower-court ruling that they say could make it harder for plaintiffs to proceed with race-discrimination allegations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Career lawyers at the department decided not to weigh in on the contracting case, which has yet to be argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. The company, Worldwide Network Services, did win support from the Lawyers&rsquo; Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the National Urban League. But its advocates say they are disappointed that the Obama administration did not lend its voice to the effort.</p>
<p>Patricia A. Millett, a lawyer at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld who represents the contracting company, said the decision by the department&rsquo;s civil rights division raises the question, &#8220;Do the actions match the words?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what I thought the civil rights division was supposed to do,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is important that these matters, which mean so much to individuals, not get lost amid all the other pressing issues before the administration.&#8221;</p>

We all knew when Mr. Holder talked about a dialogue what he meant was a monologue on black grievances.</p>
<p>Donald Rochon is a classic. He starts out with a chip on his shoulder by forcing himself on the FBI. Naturally, the people around him are angry, resentful, and likely don&rsquo;t like the jerk very much. He attributes peoples&rsquo; reaction (and not his attitude) as &#8216;racism&rsquo;. He opens the door and other blacks make issues of trivial slights, real or imagined. More resentment from whites. More real or imagined perceptions of &#8216;racism&rsquo;. </p>
<p>When he retires, all the painful memories of the past come flooding back and someone has to P-A-Y . Yet another spin of the Black Lottery. After all, he has nothing to lose and millions to gain. The FBI is left in the unwinnable position of proving they&rsquo;re not racists.</p>
<p>This is an example of diversity in the workplace.</p>

			<p> &#8220;A more open discussion of race&#8221; appears to be African-American for &#8220;easier, more lucrative ways to shake down the White folks.&#8221; Eric Holder, who is supposed to be attorney general for all Americans, seems to be bent on a lot of special pleading on behalf of his own racial group, at the expense of the White majority.</p>
<p> And note how in typical Washington Post fashion, no dissenting voice is allowed to be heard in the article   &mdash;   no one to suggest that, just possibly, this is not the right path for the Justice Department to be tramping down. It seems to me that the unending lawsuits Holder and his department are encouraging are just a way to provide more excuses for blacks to claim &#8220;discrimination&#8221; so they can collect big bucks.</p>

			<p>So far as blacks whining about imagined &#8220;injustices,&#8221; I see no difference between now and the last several years; however, on one note, something no black will like, I&rsquo;m seeing many more cases filed&hellip;and won&hellip;regarding discrimination against whites.  That will continue to increase.</p>
<p>The trek toward the multicultural utopian paradise keeps getting more contentious than ever, rather than less, as the leftist liars would like us to believe.</p>
<p>Soon, there will be actual fights, like the ones between blacks and Hispanics throughout the country, but especially the Southwest.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism has failed throughout history and it is failing right now all over the globe.  The bottom line is that, generally, all groups want to be among their own kind.  Only the mentally disturbed faction insists we would be a paradise if we all lived together as one big, happy family.</p>
<p>They will soon see their pipedreams go up in smoke, if you&rsquo;ll pardon the pun.</p>

			<p>Eric Holder&rsquo;s preference for blacks and mulatto&rsquo;s over whites is just one more piece of evidence supporting the reality that people prefer their own kind.  The one and only exception to this appears to be white liberals. </p>

			<p>Multiculturalism is an oxymoron. How could there be a culture of many cultures? It makes no sense. And yes, people do not want to associate with disparate groups. Why is it that the utopian Left cannot understand that it is human nature to want to be with one&rsquo;s own kind, and that anger, disdain, and even hate are built into our genetic code? It only takes a cursory look at the divorce rates and civil law suits to understand that people can and often hate each other&rsquo;s guts. We are only higher order animals whose base proclivities are kept in check by a thin veneer of civilization. All of us are, in effect, only a few meals away from violence and anarchy; I have been around a long time, and it is only recently that I have begun to believe that such a future is inevitable.</p>

			<p>It is time for Whites to line up and sue for every black, hispanic, etc. that got the jobs that Whites were qualified for and did not get due to affirmative action in all workplaces. I am tired of all the whining from blacks and assorted minorities while they rob us blind. We are the ones on the losing end. We pay with loss of jobs and with our tax dollars. Now that is a two-fer, is it not?  Until we quit being the nice guy and the total fool, we will continue to suffer and so will our children. Time to stand up for ourselves and our children.</p>

			<p>One of the biggest problems when dealing with blacks in any capacity is that no matter what happens to them, they will manage to convince themselves and others that they have been wronged, no matter what the circumstances.  I worked in a grocery store out &#8220;west&#8221; for many years, and we actually caught one on camera taking grapes off of a display, throwing them on the floor and stepping on them, then laying down and screaming that he&rsquo;d slipped and fell and was going to sue the company.  No doubt, in his mind, the grapes on the display were part of an evil plot to restrict his access to funds needed to redress past wrongs inflicted by an evil, repressive society against him, and throwing them on the floor and pretending to slip and fall were actions justified by these past wrongs.  The end will always justify the means when blacks need something.</p>

			<p>Invitation to a discussion on race is a trap. They wait for the many phrase or word traps they place and then they point fingers and site the pathetic numbers of black failure. Any sign of disapproval from one white man is seen as representing all whites. And temporary relief comes from payout only. The Marxist use &#8220;satire&#8221; and various humiliation techniques (pies in the ace, banner with childish phrases)  to stifle debate.  How can you fight that.  Tuck and run has been the order of battle.  When will that stop.</p>

			<p>Here is what Thomas Jefferson wrote about the Judiciary:</p>
<p> &#8220;The Constitution [would become] a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary which they may twist and shape into any form they please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jefferson warned: </p>
<p>&#8220;The opinion which gives to the judges the right to decide what laws are constitutional and what not, not only for themselves in their own sphere of action but for the Legislature and Executive also in their spheres, would make the Judiciary a despotic branch. &hellip; </p>
<p>It has long been my opinion &hellip; that the germ of dissolution of our federal government is in the constitution of the federal judiciary; working like gravity by night and by day, gaining a little today and a little tomorrow, and advancing its noiseless step like a thief, over the field of jurisdiction, until all shall be usurped.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all too true.  From Brown vs. Topeka to the affirmative action rulings it has been the Judiciary that has done the most to destroy White Americans.</p>
<p>Go back in history to 1630&rsquo;s Maryland and Virginia?  Who was it that legalized chattel slavery for blacks?  Not the British officials, not the colonial legislatures, but Judges.</p>
<p>Those rulings made the importation, ownership and buying and selling of blacks very very profitable.</p>
<p>Later, in the early 1800&rsquo;s, slavery was legalized in Georgia and  Mississippi not by legislatures but by Judges.</p>
<p>In the early 1800&rsquo;s some territories and states such as Illinois made it illegal for blacks to live in the state or territory.  The early settlers knew what would happen, the same thing that happened in Georgia.  Rich elites would move in with their black &#8220;servants&#8221;.  Sympathetic Judges would be elected or appointed.  Then would come the lawsuits requesting that the blacks be made slaves.   So keeping blacks totally out of the new states insured that no pro slavery Judges would create slavery where there was none.</p>
<p>The importation of black African slaves led to the civil war and 400 years of racial problems which seem to be getting worse and worse as we enter the 5th century of dealing with the problems created by those Maryland and Virginia Judges almost 400 years ago.</p>
<p><br>
90 years after the civil war the Judiciary, well trained by 2 generations of marxist racist law school professors sent black youth to terrorize the schools, encouraged, aided and abetted black on White crime, destroyed entire cities with their fair housing decisions, have banned Whites from working at about 90 percent of the jobs available, and have created  federal, state and local government agencies that are dedicated to the extermination of White Americans.</p>
<p>The anti White racist left has used the Judiciary against us for 70 years.  <br>

			<p>With our country continuing its inevitable slide into Fascism and depression, such alleged grievances, by, and on the part of Blacks everywhere, which are now being filed with the various federal courts, will be taking on a totally new dimension. With middle class Whites being taxed to death the mantra: &#8220;yes we can&#8221; will soon be losing its moral authority. More and more, Whites are going to resent being expected to support Blacks at the expense of themselves. Moreover, these types of lawsuits will begin to be viewed in the light for which they are: politically correct, governmental sanctioned ripoffs, designed to placate Blacks!  </p>
<p>In short, when the money runs out, Blacks will find that they are going to be expected to pay their own way. You think there is screaming now? One would think that after fifty years of politically correct, affirmative active gibberish, this race could support itself   &mdash;   but those &#8220;ones&#8221; do not reside here do they? Get ready for the riots and new governmental actions!    </p>
<p>Furthermore,this Presidency, this Opera sponsored bad joke, issued at the expense of the American middle class tax payer, is about to come to an abrupt end as well! In my view, the four Marx brothers now in charge of our country&rsquo;s economy, are more than abysmally incompetent, they are blatantly criminal. The bill is coming to our table to the tune of two trillion dollars. Our Chinese waiter is tapping his feet, shuffling about, getting nervous, while Barny and his boyfriends are trying to decide if he will take yet another worthless check! [Hint: Barney - he won&rsquo;t   &mdash;   and these T-Bills our country is now being forced to buy back will soon be causing hyper inflation    &mdash;   just what we need along with the six hundred thousand new unemployed every month - but it&rsquo;s nothing that an even larger government can&rsquo;t cure is it Barney]        </p>
<p>Blacks need to carry their own water. The difference between Black and White is more than mere pigmentation. In order to insure that the ten per cent of the blacks who are competent is not being discriminated against the White race is expected to support the ninety percent which is totally incompetent. I&rsquo;m quite sure that this would make perfect sense to Eric    &mdash;  just not to anyone here who has actually had to make a living in the real world! </p>
<p>Apparently, it has never seemed to occur to anyone that the ten percent which is capable of taking care of itself doesn&rsquo;t need our support; and, irrespective of any amount, or degree, of our help, most of the remaining ninety percent never seem to move into this ten percent, do they? What the government is of course trying to do is to perpetuate a totally dependent class for political expediency! It&rsquo;s expensive. And there ain&rsquo;t no more money guys! None! Zero! Zilch! It&rsquo;s gone! Blacks are expensive and the race as a whole costs nearly as much as bailing out your hand full of rich wall street amigos most of whom are pssssst: White. But after all our President is half white isn&rsquo;t he?         </p>
<p>This social agenda, by this lifetime government employee posing as a lawyer, can only work when money is not the issue. This lawyer might not know it, but money is now the issue with everything!  </p>
<p>Eric, liberalism might be able to get you into heaven   &mdash;   but soon, very soon, it ain&rsquo;t gonna be doing much to keep you alive here on earth.  </p>
