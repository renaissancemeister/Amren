<h1><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/11/AR2009051103503.html">Hispanics See Stars Aligned on High Court</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Barnes and Michael D. Shear, Washington Post, May 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Justice David H. Souter&rsquo;s departure from the Supreme Court gives the first African American president a historic opportunity to break another barrier by appointing the first Hispanic to the nation&rsquo;s highest court.</p>
<p>Those involved in the process inside the White House and those advising from outside say President Obama would relish such a choice. He studiously and successfully courted Hispanic support during the campaign and has maintained close ties to Latino leaders since coming to office.</p>
<p>But the White House is constructing its appointment strategy on the belief that this will not be his only appointment to the court and that he need not reach his goal of changing the racial, ethnic and gender balance on the court with just one pick.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>White House officials believe that Obama may get at least two more appointments. Justices John Paul Stevens, 89, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 76, are most often mentioned as possibilities to leave, though neither has given such an indication.</p>
<p>That would give Obama more freedom if he decided Judge Sonia Sotomayor or another Hispanic is not the right choice in the short term. He could appoint a woman this time, the thinking goes, and appoint a Latino or Latina later.</p>
<p>The pressure to name a Hispanic justice is building, with Hispanic legal groups calling  &mdash;  ever so gently  &mdash;  for the court&rsquo;s first Latino member. That call was backed up by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which told Obama that &#8220;appointing our nation&rsquo;s first Hispanic justice would undoubtedly be welcomed by our community and bring greater diversity of thought, perspective and experience to the nation&rsquo;s legal system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Congressional aides said Obama&rsquo;s administration has been reaching out to Hispanic members in recent days to get their input on the president&rsquo;s choice. Obama aides have talked with the leaders of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Chairwoman Nydia M. Velázquez and Vice Chair Charles A. Gonzalez.</p>
<p>But both the White House and the groups are taking pains to avoid the perception that putting a Hispanic on the bench would be either a demand or a reward, and Obama advisers warned that pressure campaigns can caricature potential jurists as purely ethnic choices.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The most prominent Hispanic candidate is Sotomayor of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York. She is under serious consideration by the White House and would not only become the court&rsquo;s first Hispanic member, she would also meet Obama&rsquo;s goal of naming a woman.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Would there be a disappointment in the community&#8221; if Obama does not choose a Hispanic, asked Gabriela Lemus of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda. &#8220;I would say so.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she added: &#8220;We&rsquo;re politically mature enough to know there&rsquo;s going to be another chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of the seven Hispanic appeals court judges appointed by Democrats, only Sotomayor and Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw of the 9th Circuit in California are younger than 60. There are only 15 Hispanics at the district court level appointed by Democratic presidents, compared with 33 appointed by Republicans.</p>

			<p>The good news is that Souter turned out to be an almost all the way leftist, so Obama replacing him with Sotomayor or anyone he would pick will make very little difference.</p>

<p>Well, that is beyond laughable!</p>
<p>Hispanics, &ldquo;politically mature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These after all are the &ldquo;indigenous peoples&rdquo; who either advocate for the &ldquo;rights&ldquo; of, or are in reality themselves alien invaders, while demanding that whites &ldquo;go back to Europe.&rdquo; They burn the flag of the USA or worse, while expecting that they be seen as legitimate equals to decent citizens. Moreover, they demand that even the lowest of their numbers: perverts, predators, murderers, dope peddlers, and gang-bangers, all have a &ldquo;place&rdquo; in our society and to say otherwise is &ldquo;racist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is about as &ldquo;mature&rdquo; (politically or otherwise) as a kindergartner who willfully and repeatedly soils himself, just to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; what a big and independent boy he is!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

			<p>I personally don&rsquo;t believe in giving hispanics, especially Mexicans positions of high authority in the U.S. It isn&rsquo;t because I believe that SOME of these people aren&rsquo;t up to the jobs, it is because Mexico being on the border, and Mexicans as a rule, being very loyal to Mexico. It is as simple as that, for me. In other words, just like all dual citizens, I don&rsquo;t believe they would have the United States&rsquo;s best interests at heart.</p>

			<p>The problem with all of this &#8220;hoopla&#8221;, and that&rsquo;s EXACTLY what it is, is that OUR RIGHTS are getting pushed farther and farther into the background. Who is the most qualified?? Depends on whose agenda you&rsquo;re pushing&hellip;Are we talking about expanding affirmative action, rewarding those who are non-white, while pushing whites further into abscurity? (Well, then obviously a mexican or black would be more &#8220;qualified&#8221;). </p>
<p>This political correctness, while our birthrates, jobs, communities, and culture all dwindle is our downfall. And I think that MOST OF US deserve it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can put any faith in this hope. I have heard Christians say that God helps them that help themselves. Well!! the 3rd worlders are helping themselves to our country.</p>

<p>An interesting point SKIP, but there even more interesting solutions to that conundrum you pose above. It would seem that the West having forsaken both God and themselves (at least at the &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; levels,) continues to suffer from these plagues of Third World locusts and toads. Keeping that in mind, it would be best to see these &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; removed from power and replaced with those who would prefer that the helping hand be restricted to whites and quite the reverse with its application to nonwhites.</p>
<p>That most certainly would be my solution to the problem, both in practical and theological terms!</p>
<p>All the best to you SKIP,</p>
<p>John PM!!</p>

<p>I think dogmatic belief systems are the problem- they discourage examination and discussion. Diversity I think we would all agree is a dogmatic belief system so let&rsquo;s not think that replacing one for another is the right way to go.</p>

<p>A, I could not agree with you more here!</p>
<p>However, one thing that you must never forget, is that as a dogmatic belief system such as multiculturalism and diversity worship moves to the point of  total enforced senselessness, it tends to have repercussions that are not altogether predictable, let alone controlled by rationality over time. Moreover, reactionary trends against such dogmas gone despotic, tend to have violently spontaneous: germinations, flowerings, and harvests.  </p>
<p>Or put another way, history repeats itself; the multicultural Marxists in this country have sown the wind of insanity, and shall reap only a whirlwind of lucidity gone phantasmagoric in return.</p>
<p>Read up on Europe after World War I A., particularly Weimar Germany.</p>
<p>All the best to you,</p>
