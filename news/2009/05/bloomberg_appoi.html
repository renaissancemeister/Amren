	<p>A prominent member of the city&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s Issues Commission resigned Monday, a week after she wrote an online essay advising Mexico to &#8220;get a grip on its banditos&#8221; among other disparaging remarks about the Central American country.</p>
<p>In a letter to First Deputy Mayor Patti Harris Monday, Betsy Perry, who was appointed to the commission by Mayor Bloomberg, officially stepped down from her post from the commission.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After her essay was published on The Huffington Post, where she called Mexico a nation of &#8220;guns, drugs, kidnappings and swine flu,&#8221; many lashed out at Perry, calling her remarks &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;stereotypical.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.wpix.com/landing/?blockID=280274&amp;feedID=1404">Bloomberg Appointee Apologizes for Snide Remarks About Mexicans</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Stephanie Barish, WPIX-TV, April 30, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A member of New York City&rsquo;s commission on women&rsquo;s issues is in hot water for remarks she made about Mexico in an online column she wrote for the Huffington Post Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the web essay regarding the recent pandemic of swine flu, Betsy Perry, who was appointed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg in March 2007, warns that the United States might need to &#8220;get a grip on its banditos&#8221;  &mdash;  referring to Mexicans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A slew of angry commentors responded to the essay, slamming the writing as &#8220;uninformed&#8221; and &#8220;xenophobic.&#8221; Mayor Bloomberg is also outraged, saying he had not read the essay but called the words inappropriate.  He said he doesn&rsquo;t know what Perry was thinking.</p>
<p>For her part, Perry issued an apology Thursday for her controversial remarks, via the Huffington Post.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the challenges for any blogger is to write fast, write short, and get people to find your way of thinking sharp and funny,&#8221; Perry explains. &#8220;No question that my post today was written too fast, wasn&rsquo;t short enough, and turned out to be neither sharp nor funny. I see now that it crossed the line between cute and offensive. For that, I really do apologize, and I have asked that the post be taken down.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This is reminiscent of the Francis Semler issue in Kansas City, Missouri.  Mayor Mark Funkhouser appointed her to the city&rsquo;s parks commission, knowing full well that she was a Minuteman activist.  Yet, once the usual suspects, including the NAACP, started whining, he started making mild demands for her resignation.  She didn&rsquo;t for awhile, but eventually did.</p>

			<p>Yeah, I can understand why Mayor Bloomberg would be upset,</p>
<p>&#8220;Mayor Bloomberg is also outraged, saying he had not read the essay but called the words inappropriate. He said he doesn&rsquo;t know what Perry was thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>My own personal comment on Mayor Bloombergs comment is this:</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it just so doggone sad, how people like Mayor Bloomberg, another so called &#8220;representative&#8221; of the American citizenry, become all defensive and &#8220;outraged&#8221; when they hear that illegal aliens have been smeared, etc. I said ILLEGAL ALIENS, as in Title 8, Section 1325 U.S. Immigration Law Code. But then, why really should I be surprised. Mayor Mike is the guy who said that  &mdash;  if illegal aliens were deported from New York, the golf courses would suffer.   help me!!</p>
<p>I admit that this last &#8220;outrageous&#8221; comment by Mayor Mike reveals the real purpose behind my commenting on this article. MY LORD!! If only our elected representatives would be as concerned with the American citizenry and defend them as they do with people who are here illegally, and most likely haven&rsquo;t contributed two cents in taxes, commit rampant I.D. theft, along with every other crime under the sun.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant, I&rsquo;ll hit the shower now.</p>

			<p>All she has to do is say was just talking about supporters of the right wing in Mexico, or about the corporations in Mexico. It doesn&rsquo;t have to make sense. She could go from zero to hero in no time. </p>

<p>  &mdash;  </p>
<p>The reaction is classic sheep&rsquo;s bleating.  She probably merely said that all that stuff is rampant in Mexico, which it is.  Nothing stereotypical at all, just telling it like it is.<br>

<p>No, &#8220;banditos&#8221; is referring to Mexican bandits, not to Mexicans in general.  Only an racially blinded idiot would think otherwise.</p>

			<p> The left loves to call certain speech &#8220;racist,&#8221; &#8220;xenophobic,&#8221; and &#8220;dealing in racial stereotypes.&#8221; Most of the rest of us call it &#8220;the truth.&#8221; And I wish that all White officials in this land of the free would take a public pledge never to publicly apologize for a controversial statement, ever again, amen. Once you&rsquo;ve said it, let it stand, no matter how loudly they scream.</p>

			<p>Over and over and over again,  and not just this case specifically, white people who tell the truth are castigated and then quit or are fired from thier jobs, and I assume their job will be filled with a black or at least a liberal pc correct person.  I see nothing wrong in these comments. They are the truth. Why wont whites fight for thier rights instead of just apologising and apologising more and leave thier job.  I would love to see some whites fight for thier rights, not apologise, and be fired while giving all they have fighting. Then, after being fired file a termination lawsuit and take it before a jury for deliberation. Unless they had an all black jury they may have a chance and show the pc libs a thing or two. We once had freedom of speach.  I just cant understand why whites will not fight for thier rights, but will often fight for the rights of thier enemies. We are slowly and ever increasingly doomed until we take a stand. We whites are sheep heading for slaughter.   KF     </p>

<p>I would have to agree with that. You can&rsquo;t just appeal higher up on the company ladder. The problem would be finding a lawyer willing to take up your case.</p>

<p>Right! most MEXICANS in fact are CAUCASIAN, the ones from further South, Guatemala, Hondo, El Salv, Nic are more like Indo/asians and are the bigger social/financial/criminal problem for both of our countries.</p>

			<p>Why do whites caught in this kind of situation always grovel &amp; apologize?  It&rsquo;s not going to help.  Remember radio shock-jocks The Greaseman and Don Imus?  If the multi-culti crowd has decided it&rsquo;s going to make an example of you, why help them? It&rsquo;s like Stalin&rsquo;s show trials   &mdash;   it wasn&rsquo;t enough to shoot you, he wanted to make you admit you deserved to be shot first.</p>
<p>Betsy Perry should have stood by what she wrote and forced Bloomberg to fire her.  </p>

<p>This ancient but in my opinion, valid viewpoint, at least in this world, is something so many, many Americans cannot get through their heads, and they suffer accordingly, don&rsquo;t they?</p>

			<p>I am stereotyping this woman but; if she is on some sort of Women&rsquo;s Issues Committee in NYC and appointed by Bloomberg she is probably the generic White hating, feminazi that has done so much to move the extermination of Whites forward.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t undo what the liberals did to me through affirmative action, but I can enjoy the irony when her beloved non Whites turn on a a White hating eviliberal feminazi.</p>
<p>Good </p>

			<p>Time and again, over and over, we&rsquo;ve seen all sorts of people, all over the country, get caught up in the same sort of thing: they say something honest but indelicate or not sufficiently PC, and in every case they end up apologizing and backing down. (Often it does them no good and they&rsquo;re fired anyway.) </p>
<p>I am STILL WAITING for someone with backbone enough to stand by their words and refuse to retract them.  I&rsquo;m waiting, but I&rsquo;m not holding my breath.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;I see nothing wrong in these comments. They are the truth&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Criticism does not equal hate.</p>
<p>What is so dangerous in this NWO is that valid criticism of ANYTHING non-Whites don&rsquo;t like is instantly considered hate speech, racism and xenophobia.  The hostile elites who now run this country are happy to use their powerful, well-funded organizations such as the msm, $PLC, ADL and ACLU to threaten and intimidate Whites into silence.  </p>
<p>Free Speech? Criticism?  Not For Whites except against other Whites.</p>
<p>These criticisms of non-Whites must be true, otherwise they&rsquo;d be easy to debunk and rebuke via facts, research, and other valid methods of study and argument.  </p>
<p>Rational thought, logical argument, and scientific inquiry, three of the main tenants of Western Civilization, are what is being destroyed.  These tenants along with the Rule of Law and Private Property (also being destroyed) have allowed Whites to  create the freest, healthiest, most prosperous countries ever known.  </p>
<p>Of course, Western Civilization is a White conceit, therefore it must be torn down by the hostile elites who believe it equates with White Supremacy.  </p>
<p>Because these criticisms of non-Whites cannot be refuted, they must be vehemently stifled and the individual uttering the criticism subject to termination of his livelihood and smearing of his reputation  &mdash;  as a warning to others who might be tempted try the same thing. </p>
<p>Dark times are ahead.</p>
