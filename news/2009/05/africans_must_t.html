<h1>Africans Must Travel to the Moon: Uganda President</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, May 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Africans must travel to the moon to investigate what developed nations have been doing in outer space, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Americans have gone to the moon. And the Russians. The Chinese and Indians will go there soon. Africans are the only ones who are stuck here,&#8221; Museveni said, addressing a meeting of the Uganda Law Society in Entebbe.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must also go there and say: &#8216;What are you people doing up here?&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Museveni urged the assembly of Uganda&rsquo;s top lawyers to support East African integration, arguing that one of the region&rsquo;s goals should be to develop a space programme.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uganda alone cannot go to the moon. We are too small. But East Africa united can. That is what East African integration is all about,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then we can say to the Americans: &#8216;What are you doing here all alone?&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Museveni has vocally campaigned for a common East African economic and political zone.</p>
<p>Negotiations to establish a tariff free trade zone including Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda have been ongoing for months.</p>
<p>Museveni on Saturday also called for enhanced political integration among the East African nations, suggesting the region would be strengthened by becoming one country.<br>

			<p>All these countries combined probably don&rsquo;t have the GDP of any one U.S. state.</p>
<p>There are posters here on AR that joke about the far off day that whites start colonizing space, that minority advocacy groups and/or their white fellow travellers like ADL and SPLC would start demanding that space be integrated, in order to give the Earth-stuck minorities a better environment.  Turns out that not everyone thinks it&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>BTW, the Russians have not landed men on the moon.</p>

I beg everyone&rsquo;s forgiveness, but I can&rsquo;t get the image of Wile E. Coyote out of my mind. I can see them strapping an Acme rocket to the rear end of one of their first &#8220;astronauts&#8221; and watch it fizzle and crash into a mountain! <br>
All joking aside; an ambitious man who lacks prowess brings nothing but ruin to himself and those around him. </p>

			<p>Didn&rsquo;t I read an Amren article on how South Africa could not find qualified black pilots and mechanics for their air force?  Even if Africa unites and tries to go to space they will just blame Whites for their failure in that gaol.  </p>

<p>No matter where we go, the African seems determined to follow!</p>
<p>Are they afraid if whites all leave the planet for the moon and Mars, that their free lunch will be over? More interesting, is this question: just how do they hope to build a spaceship to get to the moon, when they cannot even maintain decent commercial airlines?</p>
<p>I guess: Europe, North America, and Asia, are just supposed to give them spacecrafts and of course magically &ldquo;transfer the knowledge&rdquo; as to how to fly them?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

<p>You just can&rsquo;t make this stuff up. If you did, you would be keelhauled as a racist.</p>
<p>Well Yoweri, it&rsquo;s like this. We Whites have this incredible urge to explore, to know, to catalog, to understand, to achieve, to overcome, to fight and even risk death to lift ourselves to other worlds. This urge causes us to explore everything from the deep ocean to the deep jungle, the frigid cold of the North and South poles to the eternal cold of Space, from the tiny Atomic world of Advanced materials to the gargantuan structure of the Universe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a White thing.  </p>

			<p>I almost spit my margarita all over the screen when I read this. This is funny on too many levels. First, you got the black paranoia running rampant. Then you gotcher delusions of grandeur. Please spare me. As though ANY African nation could supply the planning, manpower and resources necessary for such an effort. Worthy of Saturday Night Live!  LOL!<br>

			<p>I wonder what this guy was on when he said this? In africa going to the moon is still considered by many to be white man&rsquo;s juju! These countries can barely make a telephone system work across their country let alone handles the complexities of going to the moon. How stupid and out of touch! </p>

			<p>This is a very good idea. I really do think that Eastern African nations should get together and build themselves a space program, using all African-educated engineers and pilots, and then send a team of African astronauts to the moon. African communities around the world will witness this, and will pull themselves up out of the depredation and violence and self-pity and the Western world will not have to care for them or be prey to their crimes any more. </p>

			<p>Oh, I see! They can&rsquo;t cooperate enough to create a modern highway system connecting their countries but they can go to the moon by cooperating. There is an old saying, &#8220;when pigs fly&#8221;! Actually, they should ask one of the flying pigs what the Americans &amp; others are doing on the moon. That way they could hear it from the pigs mouth &amp; not have to waste all that brain power on something so far beyond their comprehension.</p>
<p>Sounds like there is going to be a bumper Ganja crop in East Africa this year.</p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t this often the case with black thinking? They put &#8220;bling&#8221; over providing for their own family. In this case, the &#8220;bling&#8221; is going to the moon rather than feeding their own impoverished nation.</p>

Maybe they could turn this into a &#8220;reality&#8221; show. I would watch it. Maybe they could get thoe black &#8220;geniuses&#8221; I already see in movies I mean it must be real I see it on the screen all of the time.</p>

			<p>Not driven by a thirst for knowledge or a sense of adventure, Africa must go to space for one reason and one reason alone: everybody else is doing it. And when that golden day arrives sometime in the distant future, those poignant words will be spoken by Africa&rsquo;s first spaceman, &#8220;What are you people doing up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is why I love Africa. The laughs.</p>

Theyre just late comers in the space race.  Actually their such a truly brilliant people theyve just been too busy here on earth to take time out to explore the heavens.  Too busy getting their president elected, protesting the justifiable incarceration of 6 black youths for trying to kill an innocent white boy and singing rap diddys. </p>

			<p>A multi-million dollar Nigerian satellite launched in May 2007 has been shut down to prevent it spinning out of control and damaging others in orbit.</p>
<p>Chinese-built NigComSat-1 cost the African oil producer $340m (£228m). The Nigerian government said insurance would pay for a replacement and Nigerians should still be proud of the country&rsquo;s satellite programme. But telecoms experts told the BBC it was a &#8220;white elephant in space&#8221; and the whole operation was a &#8220;debacle&#8221;. NigComSat-1 was launched 18 months ago to much fanfare from the government, but it has been mired in controversy ever since. On Tuesday, controllers shut the satellite down because it was having problems with its power supply, the government announced.</p>
<p>The satellite was meant to provide communications for government agencies and broadband internet. &#8220;This has been a real debacle from day one,&#8221; a telecoms engineer told the BBC. The engineer, who works as a consultant for a multinational communications company, did not want to be named. The satellite was limited because the type of frequency it used was disturbed by clouds in the atmosphere, and did not work properly in Nigeria&rsquo;s rainy season or during the Harmattan, when clouds of dust blow down from the Sahara, he said. The satellite also operated on frequencies already allocated to other companies and interfered with other providers&rsquo; equipment.</p>
<p>But Information Minister John Odey denied the satellite was not worth investing in. &#8220;No technology can be a waste of money,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is a worthy investment, and Nigerians should see it as desirable. It has served a purpose and will continue to do so.&#8221; Local media initially reported that the satellite had &#8220;gone missing&#8221;. But on Wednesday Minister of State for Science and Technology Alhassan Zaku told journalists it had lost power and had to be &#8220;parked, like you would park a car&#8221;.&#8221;If it wasn&rsquo;t parked and it lost all its power there would be no energy to even move it and it would be like a loose cannon and would keep rolling about and hit other satellites in the orbit,&#8221; he told reporters.</p>
<p>According to analysts, Nigeria has made nearly $2 trillion in oil revenues over the last 30 years, but its population are mostly poor. Africa&rsquo;s most populous nation lacks basic infrastructure like power and water, and many Nigerians thought the satellite showed the government did not have its priorities right.The news that the satellite could not get enough power to run has led to jokes that, as one e-mail doing the rounds put it: Nigeria has &#8220;exported its electricity generation problems to space&#8221;. </p>

			<p>At first, I blew beer on my keyboard too. But once you think about it&hellip;<br>
JFK´s motivation was the same - to show Nikita Sergejevich that he had the bigger pipi.(the need to prove it does not speak well of JFK´s and Yoweri´s - but I digress)<br>
Let´s face it, the Apollo program was a colossal waste of money. All the moonwalkers (except Michael Jackson, who is an alien) were Air Force officers capable of little a robot probe could not have done at one per mil of the cost (except Harrison Schmitt, geologist; the only scientist ever to set foot on the moon). The Russians realized that - and acted accordingly.</p>
<p>As for the sneers about lack of technology, the US laughed Goddard off the stage. Honouring him posthumously cannot undo that. Without the Germans, there would have been no space program, whilst the Russians already had thinkers and engineers at work in the 20s.</p>
<p>- On third thought, it´s still hilarious. &#8220;What are you people doing up here?&#8221;  hmpfff :)</p>

<p>This is actually typical reasoning of the black mind.</p>
<p>If you read the black press, listen to black talk radio, or complaints from black grievance groups, a common thread is a &#8216;what is the white man doing&rsquo; paranoia.</p>
<p>The black mind rationalizes it&rsquo;s inability to compete for equal outcome with whites with elaborate conspiracy theories. That&rsquo;s why they believe their only hope for advancement is to be around whites in white schools and white neighborhoods. But when that fails to raise their status, the explanation turns to the evil conspiracy of &#8216;institutional racism&rsquo; and &#8216;white privilege&rsquo;. Basically, they can&rsquo;t accept their own failure so it MUST be something whites are doing to them.<br>

			<p>Further to my earlier post regarding NigComSat-1 (yes, that&rsquo;s really what it was named, by the Nigerian government) I later heard a story from a telecoms engineer in South Africa which I am unable to verify. Apparantly, the Nigerians approached the Chinese to provide the  satellite for a knock-down price of $US380 million but the Chinese wanted their own too. So they took the money, launched their own very successful COM-SAT then told the Nigerians that theirs didn&rsquo;t work properly so recommended &#8216;parking&rsquo; it to ensure the Nigerian government would not get sued if it collided with another satellite. Of course, the Nigerians can see it anytime they want. After all, there aren&rsquo;t that many up there, are there? I suppose that one day, when a piece of space junk falls to earth in a spectacular shower of sparks, it will inevitably be identified as NigComSat-1 by these clever Chinese. </p>

<p>Good analysis. But the conclusion from that is that there are only two  possible outcomes for us: either total separation, or becoming dragged down into their morass.  </p>
<p>As pointed out by others, the destruction of our once-great industrial base -  and eventually of our entire economy - are the inevitable result of all this cultish commitment to diversity. But that is taboo to mention in the public forum, so we keep slipping downhill to Third World status.</p>

Talk up the accomplishments of whites whenever possible.  Whites created modern civilization and made the world better for everyone.  They create wealth wherever they go.

<p>Interesting your &ldquo;majesty,&rdquo; but which do you think will come first?</p>
<p>I mean, you surely do realize that should any black tribe in Africa actually manage to achieve even the most basic of nuclear devices through their &ldquo;science&rdquo; or any other &ldquo;procurement&rdquo; procedures, what the most likely outcome will be, right? They will use it on the tribe(s) that they see as their historic rivals; normally, since the tribe or tribes in question are within about a 5 to 15 mile distance from them, they will either incinerate themselves in the initial detonation, or die from radiation poisoning a short time afterwards. </p>

<p>Just because the Chinese may bring such technologies to Africa, does not mean Blacks get to take credit for developing them.<br>
Well no more than a street criminal who happens to possess a  -Austrian built and designed, 17-round/9mm Glock pistol made of a lightweight, high-strength nylon-based polymer. <br>
Sure possessing such a piece of advanced killing technology may make them feel like &#8216;the man&rsquo; or &#8216;a big man&rsquo;.<br>
But it doesn&rsquo;t make you any more evolved, just more dangerous.<br>
And gaining fear is different to gaining respect.</p>
<p>For humanities sake I would not wish Nuclear weapons to be in the hands of any African state (for the record I&rsquo;m also not &#8216;over the moon&rsquo; about Pakistan having 100 of them either).</p>
<p>Or by the same way I know that if I gave a loaded revolver to either my one or three year old, it would mean the end of my family and house as I know it.</p>

<p><br>
It&rsquo;s not that this wasn&rsquo;t realized by the USA but even though robots could be used, it was desired for a person to actually walk on the moon. The Russians did have engineers and thinkers in the 20&rsquo;s but so did the USA and other countries. While von Braun certainly did make a big contribution to the space program at the time, saying that there wouldn&rsquo;t have been a space program in the USA without the Germans is totally false. Most of America&rsquo;s space program in the past and just about all of it today is created and run by Americans.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;They will use it (the bomb) on the tribe(s) that they see as their historic rivals; normally, since the tribe or tribes in question are within about a 5 to 15 mile distance from them, they will either incinerate themselves in the initial detonation, or die from radiation poisoning a short time afterwards</p>
<p>Call me names if you must, but I personally see no down side to this scenario! CIA couldn&rsquo;t come up with a better one. Lets give all the African tribes a low yield nuke and see what happens.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s  difficult to understand  what  the fuss all  about. Launching a  big rocket into space is not a  conceptually difficult  thing  at all. In theory it&rsquo;s  just a  matter of a proper application of the  laws of classical mechanics.</p>
<p>To convince  the  naysayers that Africans are  capable of  such, one  only  has  to  note  &mdash;  the evidence is right  there  &mdash;  that  there  are  at  least 500 African engineers, chemists and  physicists[all  with doctorates] teaching  in U.S. universities. If  they  were teaching and  researching  adequately there  would  be  no  obligation to retain them. [I  must  too  that there are universities in Africa  that have doctoral programs in engineering, mathematics and physics.] </p>
<p>These 500 scientists would  be  more  than enough to manage a space exploration program in Africa.</p>

I think you forgot a &#8220;not&#8221; after &#8220;were&#8221;, otherwise it makes no sense.<br>
And I´m afraid most of these 500 are in the soft noggin sciences (&#8220;African studies&#8221;). Short of finding one in the ruins of Zimbabwe (not improbable if they are to be believed), good luck with rockets.<br>
Besides, you´d need a few thousand for the project alone, not counting the necessary industrial and engineering infrastructure - easily meaning tens, if not hundreds of thousands of a literate workforce and a few decades.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is called &#8220;affirmative action.&#8221; Only a fool would believe that these &#8220;scientists&#8221; (provided they exist, which is doubtful) are capable of sending a rocket to the moon. Occupying a classroom and launching rockets are not the same thing.</p>

			<p>The Apollo program was not really a waste of money.  One of the things that it accomplished was massive improvements in manufacturing quality-control.  In the pre-Apollo days, nobody would think of buying a used car with 50,000 miles on the odometer.  Today, nobody thinks twice about it.</p>
<p>The electrocardiogram also had to be developed for the space program.  How many lives have those saved since then?</p>
<p>The real shame was that we didn&rsquo;t follow through with permanent installations.</p>
<p>Even when viewed as a competition with the Russians, it was a far more productive use of money than building additional tanks and armored personnel carriers.  What technological payoffs do you get by simply producing more of those?</p>

			<p>I agree with Michael C. Scott.  Necessity is the mother of invention.  IMHO, Al Qaeda needs to get a space program and an Olympic team.  That way, American interest in Space and the Olympics will suddenly rejuvenate.</p>

			<p>50,000 miles? The old VW beetle with indium bearings easily topped that.<br>
And the electrocardiogram was invented by some unknown little physician in the Netherlands - long before Apollo.<br>
Of course there were technology spin-offs, but they didn´t justify the cost (Marxist economists at the time even theorized the Americans had gotten tired of war as a means of destroying surplus accumulated capital - as in their view is necessary to avoid crises - and found a more efficient way. If they were right, Africa has even less of a chance - the last thing they have is surplus capital).</p>
<p>OK, I´ll concede that our satellite-dependent hypercivilisation now reaps the fruits of the research done then. However, this is the point: Satellites, not puerile games.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s really humorous.  Such shallow thinking.  Trying to make Aeronautical engineering related to space vehicles in such simplistic terms is truly the same as one would expect from a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;To convince the naysayers that Africans are capable of such, one only has to note &mdash; the evidence is right there &mdash; that there are at least 500 African engineers, chemists and physicists[all with doctorates] teaching in U.S. universities.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there is even one such professor as you claim, let alone 500.  At my university we didn&rsquo;t have one single black in physics classes, and likewise I knew of not one single black taking an engineering course.  Even algebra was blaringly devoid of blacks.  Some would start out the semester and be gone in two weeks.  Even knowing that they would be &#8220;awarded&#8221; favorable grades as AA attendees didn&rsquo;t help them any.</p>

<p>The 500 scientists you write of don&rsquo;t exist and you know it.  And with the average black I.Q. in Africa at about 70 do you think you are going to convince anybody here that they have qualified people?</p>
<p>Africa is STILL in or very near the stone age as the cities the white man built for them are turning to ruin, because they don&rsquo;t have the ability to maintain them.</p>
<p>There is no nation in history that has failed to produce at least some kind of creative civilization except for Africa, and the Aborigines in Australia.</p>
<p>Claiming otherwise is just deluding yourself. One just can&rsquo;t argue with failure.</p>

			<p>Are these &#8220;500&#8221; African &#8220;scientists&#8221; currently teaching at US universities the same ones who left Africa because the place has been utterly ruined by its current owners?</p>
<p>I have 79 US and foreign patents awarded, and I work as a welder out of my garage.  The stay-at-home dad thing is a bonus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have my own space program before any African nation does.</p>
