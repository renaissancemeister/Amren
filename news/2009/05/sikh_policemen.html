			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), May 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police are trying to develop bullet-proof turbans for Sikh officers to wear instead of helmets.</p>
<p>The headwear would allow those who insist on always wearing turbans to join gun or riot squads for the first time.</p>
<p>Scientists are investigating whether bullet-proof Kevlar could be used for the 15ft strip of cloth a turban requires.</p>
<p>British Police Sikh Association vice-chairman Gian Singh Chahal said: &#8216;Sikh officers have been prohibited from becoming firearms officers because our religion does not allow us to remove the turban.</p>
<p>&#8216;Nor can we wear the NATO helmet for public order policing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said research had already begun into finding the perfect material to create a ballistic turban, but that the high-tech headgear would need to pass Home Office tests before being used by officers.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;There has been some research done into producing a ballistic material for turbans and we would like to follow any opportunity where we could manufacture a ballistic product  &mdash;  made out of something like Kevlar  &mdash;  that would ensure a certain degree of protection so Sikh police officers could take part in these roles.</p>
<p>&#8216;We need to approach the Home Office and police forces and to gain their acceptance so that Sikh officers could become firearms and public order officers whilst wearing turbans.</p>
<p>&#8216;There needs to be a recognition from the Home Office that would allow Sikh officers to carry out these roles.</p>
<p>&#8216;The will is there from chief constables but perhaps not yet from the Home Office.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One Sikh PC, who didn&rsquo;t want to be named, said: &#8216;It would be incredible if they developed a bulletproof turban.</p>
<p>&#8216;It would make life a lot easier for us and would mean we could go for jobs as firearms and public order officers  &mdash;  which a lot of Sikh officers would like to do, but are currently not allowed to go for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last year West Midlands Police spent tens of thousands of pounds trying to find protective headgear to fit over a turban after a Sikh officer applied to join the counter-terrorist Operational Support Unit.</p>
<p>The force spent 18 months looking for a solution, but failed to find any suitable equipment.</p>
<p>The officer was rejected from the job because he couldn&rsquo;t fit a helmet and respirator over his turban, and instead returned to his job on the beat.</p>
<p>The unnamed officer reportedly claimed to have been discriminated against and was on long-term sick leave suffering from stress.</p>
<p>Dr Indarjit Singh, director of the Network of Sikh Organisations, said Sikhism is the only religion in the world in which wearing a turban is mandatory for all adult males.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;It is mandatory for adult Sikh men to wear the turban.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Turbans consist of around 15ft of cloth wound around the head.</p>
<p>Sikh men wear them to cover their hair, which they leave uncut in accordance with their religion. They often wear their long beards rolled up.</p>
<p>As well as being a sign of spirituality, the turban is also a symbol of Sikh identity and of courage.</p>
<p>There are more than 750,000 Sikhs, the only religion allowed to ride motorbikes without crash helmets, in the UK.</p>
<p>Sikh soldiers serving in the British Army refused to wear helmets during the First and Second World Wars.</p>
<p>They fought with their turbans on, several receiving the Victoria Cross for acts of gallantry.</p>
<p>Legendary British General Sir Frank Messervy praised the Sikh soldiers who laid down their lives in the two world wars.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;In the last two world wars 83,005 turban wearing Sikh soldiers were killed and 109,045 were wounded. </p>
<p>&#8216;They all died or were wounded for the freedom of Britain and the world, and during shell fire, with no other protection but the turban, the symbol of their faith.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Home Office spokesman said: &#8216;The Government wants a police service that reflects the diverse communities it serves. </p>
<p>&#8216;It is down to individual forces to make reasonable adjustments to accommodate the religion or beliefs of individual officers, as far as operational requirements permit.&rsquo;<br>
