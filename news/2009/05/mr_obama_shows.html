<h1>Mr. Obama Shows His Hand</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> May 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama has surprised no one by appointing a vividly race-conscious Hispanic as his first nominee to the United States Supreme Court. Some of Sonia Sotomayor&rsquo;s choicer observations have now been widely reported: &#8220;I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/us/15judge.html" target="whitemale" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>reach a better conclusion than a white male</b></a> who hasn&rsquo;t lived that life.&#8221; She also says sex and race &#8220;may and will make a difference in our judging.&#8221; (These remarks appeared in a publication that is called  &mdash;  apparently with a straight face  &mdash;  the <a href="https://www.boalt.org/LRLJ" target="LRLJ" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b><cite>Berkeley La Raza Law Journal</cite></b></a>) Miss Sotomayor is certainly no stranger to identity politics. She is a <a href="https://www.abanet.org/publiced/hispanic_s.html" target="PRBA" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>member</b></a> of the Puerto Rican Bar Association, the Hispanic National Bar Association, the Association of Judges of Hispanic Heritage, and the National Council of La Raza.</p>
<p>Miss Sotomayor&rsquo;s record bears out her self-proclaimed bias. She dismissed the right of New Haven&rsquo;s white firefighters to bring suit when their promotion exam was thrown out because only whites got the top scores  &mdash;  and she <b>didn&rsquo;t even think it necessary to write an opinion explaining why.</b<> </p>
<p>She clearly thinks her role is to rule, not to ensure that the laws are Constitutional. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfC99LrrM2Q" target="policy" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>another of her well-circulated comments</b<> she said that a &#8220;court of appeals [the level at which she sits] is where policy is made.&#8221; No, Sonia, the legislative branch is where policy is made. It would be hard to think of a statement that so blatantly demonstrates a lack of what we used to call &#8220;judicial temperament.&#8221; This woman has sharply liberal politics and exercises her power in an attempt to advance those politics. Not surprisingly, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/27/60-reversal-of-sotomayor-rulings-gives-fodder-to-f/" target="reversed" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>her opinions are frequently reversed on appeal.</b> </p>
<p>Miss Sotomayor&rsquo;s record shows that, like Justice Ruth Ginsberg, she is likely to give foreign legal opinions considerable deference. One European legal flourish much admired by liberals is to justify hate speech laws by arguing that some opinions are so loathsome they are not protected by the right of free speech. Miss Sotomayor has not yet had a chance to try this argument out on the First Amendment, but I suspect she would love the opportunity. If she is confirmed, she will end up like Thurgood Marshall, a justice whose racial preoccupations and biases eventually became so simple-minded as to be almost comical.</p>
<p>And there is little doubt she will be confirmed. As noted above, she is on record as saying, in effect, that Hispanic women are wiser and better than white men. The spineless white men we call senators will prove her right by confirming her.</p>
<p>Of course, justices such as Sonia Sotomayor are what Americans, whether they knew it or not, were voting for last November, and we can count on more nominations of the same stripe: unapologetic race and sex quotas designed to turn the Supreme Court into an engine of increasingly blatant dispossession. If a majority-white court has repeatedly shown itself capable of finding that equal opportunity requires discrimination against whites, what level of creativity will an increasingly non-white court bring to the job of interpreting the Constitution? Mr. Obama will no doubt do his best to make sure we find out.<br>

		<p>It won&rsquo;t be Mr. Obama doing his best to make sure we find out what level of creativity a leftist and increasingly non-white court will use in order to further the unending attacks from all sides on whites in the US. It will the Mr. Obama&rsquo;s string pullers like Rahm Emanuel, Peter Orszag (brought in to destroy the US economy) and others of the elitist NWO crowd who will tell Obama, Sotomayor and the rest of their hand picked tools how far to go in their campaign against whites, mainly the white middle and lower classes. </p>

If her appointment is a foregone conclusion, I&rsquo;d like to see some Republicans with backbones challenger her on her documented comments. The least they can do is ask her straight out if she&rsquo;s going to make decisions based on sex, race, and ethnicity. They can ask her about La Raza and what they stand for and espouse for the [Hispanic] &#8220;Race&#8221;. They can ask if she&rsquo;s going to be an activist judge. At least we can have her answers on the record.</p>
<p>Even if one maverick Republican had the guts to ask substantive questions, I&rsquo;m sure other Republicans would denounce the former and feel compelled to approve the nomination in a vain effort to salvage the GOP [non] standing with Hispanics.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor once asked what fanciful interpretations of the Constitution Lani Guinier would make if she were on the Supreme Court. I fear we&rsquo;re going to find out but with Sonia Sotomayor instead.</p>

		<p>Absolutely all the worst traits and character deficiencies one might ascribe to a judge, and she doesn&rsquo;t even try to hide them. She flaunts them.  Fair and impartial? Not a chance. Sure wouldn&rsquo;t want to be the unfortunate White male petitioner whose last legal remedy would be dependent on a justice who had already declared White males to be inferior. But for Obama, she is the perfect pick&hellip;someone whose disdain for the constitution matches his own. </p>
<p>&#8220;As noted above, she is on record as saying, in effect, that Hispanic women are wiser and better than white men. The spineless white men we call senators will prove her right by confirming her.&#8221;</p>

		<p>And I thought that our &#8220;national goal&#8221; was that race would be irrelevant; so why is her being &#8220;Latina&#8221; worthy of a headline?  Why the triumphant posing?  Because &#8220;Babylon is falling.&#8221;  Many none-whites see the white man&rsquo;s world as an evil-empire that should be ovethrown.  And many whites agree with them.  </p>
<p>Look for more references to words like &#8220;white privilege&#8221; that must be destroyed.  See Noel Ignatief and his publications urging the eradication of &#8220;whiteness&#8221; as an unearned privilege. </p>
<p>Long ago, after her graduation party, when the guests had left, and a young woman was sitting around a dying fire with her family and close friends, they spoke of a rosy future in relaxed and mellow tones and how they would bring about a better world.  &#8220;What are we going to do about world peace?  What are we going to do about poverty?  What are we going to do about the blacks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&rsquo;t have to worry what you are going to do about the blacks,&#8221; her father said.  &#8220;What you have to worry about is what the blacks are going to do about YOU.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m actually a fairly level-headed guy. I&rsquo;m not prone to outbursts of anger or frustration, and my chosen profession has instilled in me the patience of Job. </p>
<p>However, this whole Sotomayor business - and the broader anti-white implications it has - are actually leading me to a point where I&rsquo;ll be so furious I&rsquo;ll slip into brain-lock.</p>
<p>Forget racial politics and whatnot&hellip;why is it that the average white citizen doesn&rsquo;t demand fairness? Regardless of race, why do white people tolerate out-and-out second class status? Why will a white person let the other team have six downs per possession but take only two downs for their own? </p>
<p>I just simply want to scream. If average white Americans (i.e. those not already racially aware) don&rsquo;t get angry over this, the lambs are already en route to the slaughter. </p>

		<p>This is what I most feared about an Obama administration.  A president&rsquo;s Supreme Court choices can wreak havoc on the nation for many years after the president is gone.  You can be sure that Ms. &#8220;La Raza&#8221; Sotomayor will rule in favor of illegal immigration every time.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn&rsquo;t lived that life.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Not one word about actually upholding the Constitution of the United States.  Instead, we&rsquo;re supposed to believe she&rsquo;ll make better decisions than Scalia simply because she&rsquo;s not white and not male.  Unfortunately, with the Democrats now a majority there is little doubt her nomination will be accepted.<br>

<p>Night is descending on America, and I am not kidding.</p>
<p>In my younger days, I would laugh. But now I can&rsquo;t, because I see that all the fools that voted for Obama drilled holes in the boat in which my family and I are also floating.</p>
<p>So be it.</p>
<p>The four-year-long Halloween is getting scarier, pretty quick, and White people had better join in, with masks and costumes that celebrate OUR side!</p>

		<p>Our opponents are quite smart about most things, but I think they making a big mistake with Obama. I&rsquo;ve seldom seen a hand so over played as this thing with shoving Obama&rsquo;s face in front of us so much as this is. They leave themselves very little room to maneuver if/when this poor slob slips up. Sort of like having all their eggs in one basket.</p>

<p>I normally do not disagree with Mr. Taylor, but here I am forced to!</p>
<p>If this Red creature Comrade Sonia is a member of La Raza, there is nothing comical (nor will there ever be) about her views. She is at best, an internal terrorist sympathizer and a stealth traitor; at worst, she is an open traitor and a downright internal terrorist herself, who simply wishes to &ldquo;mask&rdquo; her outrages from the bench. </p>
<p>Given her known ramblings, I would go with my latter assessment of her.</p>

<p>Quite the contrary, Obama, Sotomayor and the left wing laywers guilds that support them both do mention &#8220;upholding the Constitution.&#8221;  What they mean by that is:  (1) Abortion, and (2) Not hurting the feelings of AQ and Taliban terrorists in our custody, (3) birthright citizenship for illegal aliens. (4) Abortion.  (5) Federal prosecution of white cops who dare lay a hand on a black criminal suspe, er, discrimination victim. (6) The right of Democrat Presidents to veto Republican congressional &#8220;budget cuts&#8221; (i.e. reductions in the rate of increase of spending).  (7) Did I mention Abortion?</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s &#8216;funny&rsquo; is that it&rsquo;s only controversial if a nominee doesnt have bias, and very controversial, although the recent one, Judge Roberts claimed something like, &#8216;the way to stop discriminating by race, is to stop discriminating by race&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>The confirmation process will be interesting.  Will any Republicans or conservative Democrats vote against her?  Or will the white majority Senate help in their own children&rsquo;s extermination.  WW II all over.  White America rather reminds me of the Jewish security officers who guarded fellow Jews for the Nazis.  Or the Jewish Poles who joined up with the invading Soviets and helped kill Catholic Poles.  You never win by betraying your own, you might gain some breathing room, but you never win.</p>

<p>Within the context of a multicultural society, it&rsquo;s just a run-of-the-mill mediocre speech, muddled in parts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s underlying assumptions of the correctness of multiculturalism is what I find most disheartening.</p>
<p>Our Federal and local governments are in the process of becoming a collection of small U.N.&rsquo;s, with members concerned with the whole, but also very conscious of their status as representatives of their cultural group. That&rsquo;s not assimilation.</p>
<p>Not that I want assimilation or think it possible&hellip;I want whites to somehow regain our country.</p>

<p>This gives me the idea of forming an organization called &#8220;White men of Westchester&#8221;. I am seriously considering such a move. I feel so much excitement and energy from the mere thought of it. </p>

		<p>We already know how the census will become a tool to increase the power of the Left.  The decade&rsquo;s count in 2010 will have repercussions in assigning new legislators and in the Feds formulas for sending funds to states by population.  This is why Obama sought to move the census from one Cabinet department to another.  And he will probably be hiring Acorn workers (those who registered so many &#8220;new&#8221; voters) to work their miracles in counting for the next census.  Although the Constitution declares enumeration for the census, Left-wing, politically motivated guestimates, will be used instead.  And the Supreme Court will have to decide.  Any guess as to how Senora Sotomayor will vote when this issue comes to the court?  Sadly, we can guess how she will vote on most important issues.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -HM</p>

		<p>Keep in mind that Supreme Court justices are subject to the same punishment that the President &amp; Co are   &mdash;   impeachment. </p>
<p>This punishment was levied against Justice Samuel Chase in 1805, and while he was acquitted on the charges, the power still exists. And it only requires a simple majority in congress.</p>
<p>The spirit of this power is to remove judges who show that they are involved in a great deal of political activities&hellip; which Ms. Sotomayor seems to be. </p>

<p>&#8220;She spoke at a UC Berkeley School of Law symposium titled &#8216;Raising the Bar: Latino and Latina Presence in the Judiciary and the Struggle for Representation.&rsquo; The symposium was co-hosted by the La Raza Law Journal, the Berkeley La Raza Law Students Association, the Boalt Hall Center for Social Justice, and the Center for Latino Policy Research.&#8221; </p>

<p>On this page of a random issue of  the La Raza Law Journal, check out the titles of some of the other articles:</p>
<p>&#8220;Reparations Theory and Postcolonial Puerto Rico: Some Preliminary Thoughts&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Osmotic Borders: Thinking Locally, Thinking Globally about the Causes and Effects of Labor Migration&#8221;</p>

<p>Hopefully she&rsquo;s not going to be so bad on free speech issues.  According to an article in the New Republic by a Gordon Silverstein:</p>
<p>&#8220;She has even issued a passionate defense of the right of a police employee in New York to send &#8220;patently offensive, hateful and insulting&#8221; racist communications on his own time: The &#8220;concerns about race relations in the community,&#8221; she wrote in a dissent, cannot and must not &#8220;gloss over&#8221; three decades of jurisprudence and &#8220;the centrality of the first amendment in our lives just because&#8221; the government or the court is &#8220;confronted with speech it does not like.&#8221; </p>
<p>Not sure what case he is referring to, but assuming he&rsquo;s not making this up, it is reason not to fear the worse in this particular area. <br>

		<p>The current headline on World Net Daily is reporting that the American Bar Association is stating that based on their records, Sotomayor is a current/long time member of La Raza.</p>
<p>It just gets better and better.  Weren&rsquo;t they the ones that ran the Mexican flag up the flagpole at a US Post Office in California?  I am sure she will enforce the border law in Texas and Arizona and California and New Mexico to keep out those pesky Mexican illegals.  One couldn&rsquo;t dream this stuff up!  Its amazing!</p>

		<p>I always ask myself the followong question:&#8221;Why does it continue year after year&#8221;. I am sure the rest of you have asked the same question. The answer is fairly obvious. The full-blown revolt against race replacement requires a critical number of Native Born White American having their teeth kicked out by reality. WE are moving to that point in time. Critical mass will be reached. When critical mass is reached their will be a full blown revolt against race-replacement. I think Peter Brimelow wrote once that when the revolt arives it will be total. I have no doubt that the revolt will arrive and that it will be total.WE have not even flexed our muscle yet!!!!!</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans do not need the permission of post-1965 asians,hispanics,muslims,carribeans,nigerians and american blacks to poltically organize around their legitimate racial interests. This is what Jared Taylor should say in a debate with a liberal,a leftist and a post-1965 hispanic,muslim,asian or black. And I would follow it up with&#8221;And what are you going to do about that&#8221;.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor needs to comming out &#8220;swinging&#8221; in all future debates. Enough of the nonesense.</p>
<p>I have been a fighter my whole life. I am not backing down to these bullies.</p>

<p>Of course! These liberal elites know what&rsquo;s best (at least for minorities) and don&rsquo;t have to explain matters to us unenlightened peasants.</p>
<p>It looks like her feelings as an Hispanic women will trump constitutional law should they conflict. If she is as bad a choice as she seems then  a few more Supreme Court judges like her and our constitution is just a piece of paper. </p>

		<p>There is only ONE white, male, protestant on the US Supreme Court (Stevens). If anyone lacks representation on the highest court, it would be the biggest majority in this country. When Stevens is gone, there will be none of the founding stock on the supreme court.</p>

		<p>IMO whites need to become one issue voters.  The ongoing and strengthening attack on white people is going to get worse. Any candidate who does not support equal treatment for whites is unacceptable.  They must oppose immigration.  Only after that consider other issues.  Whites are already being murdered, raped, framed and denied legal rights.  If you&rsquo;re lying on the ground in a pool of blood do other political issues matter?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been coming to this site regularly for a couple months now and I pour over these stories and all of the related comments. I&rsquo;m relieved to see that there are many out there who feel the same as I do and state it in an articulate manner but what can be done anymore?</p>
<p>The media has successfully branded any Conservative as either an out of touch, rich white man in a three piece suit, a swastika covered skinhead, or a NASCAR &#8216;redneck&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As a result most young people, minorities and naive women won&rsquo;t even listen to the common sense coming from the right and blindly follow what SNL and jon stewart say in order to be cool or hep or whatever social void they are trying to fill.</p>
<p>There has to be a way to combat the hatred and bigotry the left churns out just to open a small crack so level headed people will just begin to &#8216;listen&rsquo; to what is really happening around them.</p>
<p>The culture today is so obsessed with pop culture and the ignorance of the youth (in general) is so astounding I don&rsquo;t see good things for the future?</p>

<p>Curiously, you mentioned Nascar and various stereotypes of whites by anti-white bigots.  The NAACP is thinking of calling a boycott against Miami-Dade Motor Speedway because it dares let white Southerners don Southern flags.  </p>

<p>If the blacks started boycotting the speedway, how could anyone tell?  For all we know, they could have started the boycott 20 years ago.</p>

		<p>Liberals try to defend Sotomayor&rsquo;s racist/sexist statements by pointing out &#8220;that everyone has their biases&#8221;. It is true that we all have our biases, but Sotomayor and her ilk seem think that their biases are virtues rather than vices. They embrace them as &#8220;rich experiences&#8221; rather than things to overcome in the interest of objectivity, justice and fairness. It is pretty clear that Sotomayor sees herself as a representative of Hispanic interests in this country and not as a disinterested arbiter nor an upholder of that &#8220;white male&#8221; document called the U.S. Constitution. <br>
If she is confirmed, we can expect nothing but left-wing, anti-white judicial activism on her part. We are paying for the stupidity of allowing decades of non-white immigration into this country. We are surely Balkanizing the U.S.A. and we can look forward to enjoying all the &#8220;blessings&#8221; that diversity brought to the former Yugoslavia.</p>

   Logic and sane thinking dictates that we as a thinking people want leaders in an important job like that of firefighters who know what they are doing because lives of people both in the fire department and in the citizenry are at stake and those that passed the promotion tests proved that they have the knowledge to save lives in a tough situation.  To hold these people back because of the color of their skin is not only flagrant and &#8220;in your face&#8221; racism and discrimination but it also puts all of us at risk.  No doubt these blacks and Hispanics that flunked the tests never wanted to be firemen in the first place and were the result of affirmative action which also breaks our laws on discrimination in the work place.  </p>
<p>   But according to thoughtless Judges like Sonia Stotmayor it&rsquo;s perfectly ok to break the law as long as it stomps on the rights of whites.  With this line of sick racist thinking the obvious next step will be to trash diplomas in high school and college if more whites graduate than blacks and Hispanics.  This will all fit the agenda of our anti-white, anti-American, and anti-constitutional President.                    </p>

     Years ago, I read where some Chinese big shot said, after the death of Mao, that the generation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will have to be passed over.  So twisted had their minds been that the Old Reds would have to stay in power until their grandchildren were ready to rule.  That&rsquo;s about where we are.  Fortunately, when we take over, we won&rsquo;t need any witch hunts to decide who ought spend their lives serving obediently in the fields.  The worthless and the mindless won&rsquo;t be able to hide, they&rsquo;ve been publicly boasting of their misdeeds for years.  </p>

		<p>Sonia Sotomayer and those like her are the result of our 1965 immigration reform act and the all pervasive cultural Marxism taught in schools.  She&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg of millions of non-white racial minorities who, although they live very well in America, have a burning resentment and hatred of whites and America&rsquo;s European origins and traditions.</p>
<p>As an activist Supreme Court justice, Sotomayer will legislate from the bench and she&rsquo;s said as much from her past public pronouncements.  The first and second amendments will be in jeopardy. She has the same jaundiced view of America as does Obama and will be all too happy to oblige him in his ongoing war against white America.  </p>
<p>The Republicans won&rsquo;t oppose a bigoted Latina since that might alienate Hispanics.  That speaks volumes about the mindset and character of our nation&rsquo;s Hispanics if they agree with Sotomayor.      </p>
