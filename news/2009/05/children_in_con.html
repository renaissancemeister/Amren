<h1><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-05-20-childwitch_N.htm">Children in Congo Forced Into Exorcisms</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Harris, USA Today, May 20, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a United Nations report issued this year, a growing number of children in the Democratic Republic of Congo are being accused of witchcraft and subjected to violent exorcisms by religious leaders, in which they are often beaten, burned, starved and even murdered. The relatively new phenomenon has become one of the main causes in Central Africa for humanitarian groups, which are organizing programs to protect children&rsquo;s rights and educate pastors on the dangers of accusing children.</p>
<p><b>Ties to poverty</b></p>
<p>Liana Bianchi, the administrative director for the humanitarian group Africare, says the trend is partly the result of decades of war and economic decline in the Congo. The non-profit group Save the Children estimates that 70% of the roughly 15,000 street children in Kinshasa, the capital, were kicked out of their homes after being accused of witchcraft.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my opinion,&#8221; Bianchi said, &#8220;poverty is really at the root of child abandonment. Accusations of witchcraft have become socially acceptable reasons for why a family turns a child out on the street.&#8221;</p>
<p>The practice, which has also been reported in Nigeria and Angola, can be lucrative for the priests who perform them.</p>
<p>Pastor Tshombe charged Julie Moseka $50 to exorcise her emaciated daughter, Noella, 8. The average annual salary in Congo is $100.</p>
<p>During the ceremony, Pastor Tshombe and three of his aides held Noella&rsquo;s spindly limbs down and poured hot candle wax on her belly while she screamed and cried. Then the pastor bit down hard and pulled the skin on her stomach, pretending to pull demonic flesh out of her.</p>
<p>In an interview afterward, Tshombe acknowledged the ritual can be painful, but he says it&rsquo;s necessary because otherwise the children would not be &#8220;cured.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The pastors who conduct such rituals are non-denominational, and most have no theological training, says Matondo Kasese of the humanitarian group Reejer. According to Arnold Mushiete, a social worker with a small Catholic organization called Our House, Congo&rsquo;s atmosphere of religious fervor, minimal education and rampant poverty makes for fertile territory for pastors who convince desperate parents that their children are the cause of their financial, medical and romantic problems.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Congolese legislature recently passed a law that makes it illegal to accuse children of witchcraft, but many activists, including Bianchi, say the law is not enforced.</p>
<p>Even the head of a special government commission to protect children accused of witchcraft said he thinks it is possible for children to be &#8220;sorcerers.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Was this sort of thing happening when the Congo was a Belgian colony?  These do-gooder humanitarian libs, the same kind that demanded white decolonization, can&rsquo;t have it both ways.</p>
<p>As whites retreated from South Africa and Zimbabwe, various sorts of pseudo-religious nonsense was re-established, legally and otherwise.</p>

			<p>There was a Nightline episode last night devoted to this topic. The most telling moment (apart from the various exorcisms, sometimes performed by enema) was the interview with some local official who decried unauthorized exorcisms, but added that there are recognized symptoms of witchcraft, such as &#8220;large bellies&#8221; and &#8220;large eyes,&#8221; which would warrant government action. </p>

			<p>Question Diversity,</p>
<p>Sir, you ask if this sort of thing was going on under belgian rule and my answer to you is no.</p>
<p>However, unfortunately, much worse things were going on when the Congo was known as the Free State under owner, Leopold of Belgium. It was actually his property. They did all sorts of lousy things to the natives to get rubber.</p>

<p>I would bet that nothing was as bad as what African blacks do to African blacks in Black Africa, or Detroit etc. etc. and the usual suspects. AND!! I don&rsquo;t care.</p>

			<p>The article implies that many, if not most, of these parents don&rsquo;t really believe their kids are possesed. They just use it as an excuse to abandon their children so they can save $. </p>

			<p>Washington, DC  &mdash;  The introduction of legislation in the US Senate and House of Representatives earlier this week to commit the United States to comprehensive efforts to help civilians threatened by one of the world&rsquo;s longest-running and brutal insurgencies is a crucial step forward for US policy in the region, a coalition of 22 human rights, humanitarian, and faith-based groups said today.</p>
<p>If passed, the Lord&rsquo;s Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act would require the Obama Administration to develop a regional strategy to protect civilians in central Africa from attacks by the rebel Lord&rsquo;s Resistance Army (LRA), and enforce the rule of law and ensure full humanitarian access in LRA-affected areas. The act additionally commits the United States to increase support to economic recovery and transitional justice efforts in Uganda. The coalition of supporting organizations includes groups in Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, and Uganda, where communities are currently threatened by the LRA.</p>

			<p>we are told poverty is the root of abandonment, then in the next sentence that exorcisms cost 1/2 the average annual wage.</p>
<p>These statements contradict one another.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe aid workers know whether it is a new phenomenon or not, or anything else about it, for that matter.</p>
<p>We know and understand very little about Africa, or the African mind, we have always assumed that &#8220;our&#8221; blacks were blank slates to be inscribed with western values. </p>
<p>African Americans are unlike African, but also unlike white  Americans.</p>
<p>We do not uderstand black Americans simply because we do not understand anything at all about where they came from.</p>

<p>Well, yeah, as another poster previously mentioned the symptoms of severe malnutrition (swollen bellies, large eyes etc.) also indicative of witchcraft so it kind of works itself out. </p>
<p>Being a superstitious lot, a good percentage of Africans probably actually DO believe that starving children are possessed or whatever. However, deep down, I think that it is probably understood that accusing your own starving children of &#8220;witchcraft&#8221; is a way of abandoning children you aren&rsquo;t able to support while still saving face. </p>
<p>From what I understand of Africans, for both men as well as women, the amount of offspring you are able to produce is indicator of your social status.  In my line of work where I have to deal with African immigrants on a fairly regular basis, it seems like every African I ever meet, even the most wretched and impoverished, is eager to tell tales of having multiple &#8220;wives&#8221; and scores of children back in Africa. I am assume that since monogamy is pretty much unheard of, you typically have four of five males claiming credit for each child born since its not like claiming paternity will give rise to any responsibilities or obligations.<br>

			<p>This witchcraft nonsense is just an excuse for these Africans to absolve themselves of their responsibility to feed and clothe their children.</p>
<p>It is a mark of status in Africa for women to conceive many children and for men to impregnate a lot of women and have an ungodly amount of children.</p>
<p>However, taking care of these children is another matter. First, they starve their children and when the children manifest the symptoms of starvation (large eyes, swollen bellies), they accuse the children of having the characteristics of being witches (aka starvation). Second, they turn the children out of the house so that they don&rsquo;t have to take care of them anymore.</p>
<p>Then, the have more children to increase their status.</p>

<p>Pretending? Tut, tut. Doesn&rsquo;t this writer realize that he is imposing his own Western standards of science on Congolese culture? Why does he think &#8220;pretending?&#8221; Isn&rsquo;t that simply a display of bias towards white Western standards of evidence? We can&rsquo;t have that! Terribly judgmental!</p>
<p>You see, the multiculturalists want to have it both ways. They want to embrace multiculturalism when it seems harmless, but stamp it down when it shows its barbaric side. Of course, you can&rsquo;t have it both ways. You must either accept multiculturalism or reject it. How is it &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; when it is adulterated and oppressed by outsiders?</p>
<p>The whole point of different cultures (one per country) is that each can express itself in the laboratory of reality and see which works best. That conflicts with the whole  concept of multiculturalism.</p>
