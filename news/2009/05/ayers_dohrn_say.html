<h1>Ayers, Dohrn Say Racism Not Dead</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Abdon M. Pallasch, Chicago Sun Times, May 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>So how do a couple of ex-radical anti-war activists spend Memorial Day?</p>
<p>Former &#8220;Weather Underground&#8221; activists Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn held a discussion about whether President Obama&rsquo;s election moved America past racism  &mdash;  far from it they say  &mdash;  at the Hyde Park Arts Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Memorial Day, we hear that the anti-war movement just pisses people off and makes them pro-war and that&rsquo;s insane,&#8221; Ayers told the crowd of 24 white, black and Hispanic men and women. Ayers and Dohrn wore blue jeans and black tops and Ayers drank iced coffee from a plastic Starbucks cup.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Michelle Obama has become the queen, not just of America, but of the world,&#8221; Ayers said. &#8220;Just a few months ago, she was being dragged through the media in what one New York Times person called &#8216;Round Two of the sulfurous national game of Kill the Witch.&rsquo; She was the &#8216;Black Nationalist&rsquo; who was &#8216;dangerous&rsquo; and &#8216;frightening, unlike her husband who was cool.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ayers found himself in the news again this weekend because he was one of 60 college professors to sign a letter to Obama asking him not to send a wreath to be laid at the graves of Confederate soldiers. Obama compromised and sent one to the graves of African-American soldiers, too.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ayers and Dohrn declined to give Obama a grade on his first 100-plus days, saying it will all depend on whether activists in the streets push him to do great things. &#8220;The election of Obama was an astonishing moment. We were in Grant Park dancing in the streets,&#8221; Ayers said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty-seven percent of white voters did not vote for Obama,&#8221; Dohrn said. Referring to hers and Ayers new book, Race Course: Against White Supremacy, she said, &#8220;That was the impetus for writing this book. We&rsquo;ve got a big job to do to change those numbers.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Whenever these people speak their commentary reeks of racism, only it is racism against Whites.  In a nation where Whites are the majority, it would be normal for Whites to dominate the culture and the governance of that nation.  But not in America, we had to take our sense of fairness to the most ridiculous extremes&hellip;. as ridiculous as Ayers proclaiming Michele Obama &#8220;the queen of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>When will &#8216;white supremacy&rsquo; end? Their answer seems to be as soon as they finish their job making everyone think and act as they do.</p>
<p>The liberal, Marxist agenda is clear; eliminate white consciousness and white resistance to black rule.</p>
<p>But is it really black rule they&rsquo;re after or is it rule by black figureheads? I&rsquo;m sure Bill Ayers, David Axelrod, and Rahm Emanuel know the answer.</p>

			<p>Ayers and Dohrn are insane. Perhaps they should seek an appropriate venue in which to live, such as say, North Korea or Cuba. They would not last long in either place. Anyway, no democratic presidential candidate has received a majority of the white vote since Lyndon Johson in 1964. This includes those who won the office such as Carter, Clinton. Indeed, if whites voted republican in the same percentages that blacks and hispanics vote for the democratic party as well as candidates of their own race, the demos would be dead in the water. </p>

<p>I find it darkly amusing that - had Ayers used his devious cunning for a terroristic &#8220;pro-white&#8221; organisation instead of a far-Left group - he would be serving a very lengthy sentence.</p>
<p><i>Ayers found himself in the news again this weekend because he was one of 60 college professors to sign a letter to Obama asking him not to send a wreath to be laid at the graves of Confederate soldiers.</i></p>
<p>One of the often-unmentioned coming tragedies of white extinction is <i>what will happen to those whites that died in wars predating World War 2</i>? Does anyone think </p>

<p>Why don&rsquo;t we start an &#8220;Afrikaner-for-an-Academic&#8221; project instead:<br>
By which the U.S. will exchange a white Afrikaner living in grinding poverty in South Africa for one of the hordes of Ivory Tower white academics in the U.S. espousing these ridiculous notions of &#8220;white privilege&#8221;.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be too much to ask these guys to live in the self-same &#8220;multi-cultural&#8221;, &#8220;plural&#8221; and &#8220;diverse&#8221; societies this lot espouses, as opposed to torturing them with their own horrifying reality of living in majority-white neighbourhoods and states right?</p>

			<p>     Maybe those 57 percent didn&rsquo;t vote for Obama because they thought he-lacked experience-was too liberal-was absent from the Senate too often-had too many connections with the Chicage political machine-was a racist along with his reverend-spoke a lot but said nothing-was friends with violent criminal sociopaths-. I could go on and on, but you get the idea. Now that 57 percent must be sent to reeducation camps where all traces of freedom and individuality must be stamped out.</p>

			<p> So 57 percent of White voters rejected Obama in the 2008 election? What percentage of black voters cast their ballots for John McCain, I wonder? But of course, minorities always get a pass on issues like that. If they support one of their own, it&rsquo;s &#8220;Black Pride&#8221; or some such. If Whites support one of THEIR own, it&rsquo;s &#8220;White racism.&#8221;</p>
<p> On another issue address in this column, I was glad to see that the Mulatto Messiah at least had enough backbone to go ahead and send the wreath to the Confederate Memorial. That&rsquo;s precisely what he should have done. And I have no problem with his honoring the black Union soldiers. But how about a separate honor for the estimated 30,000 to 65,000 blacks who fought for the Confederacy? Oh, I forgot: The leftist professors would not even admit that they existed, let alone approve their being honored.</p>

			<p>So, just because we don&rsquo;t vote for someone means we&rsquo;re wrong?  We&rsquo;re entitled to our opinions.  And everything isn&rsquo;t about race like they want it to be.  Some people don&rsquo;t like his thoughts and plans on how to run the country.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a childish way of thought.</p>
<p>If there wasn&rsquo;t race, they wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to complain about and make money off of.</p>

			<p>Where the bubbleheads Ayers and Dohrn don&rsquo;t figure into their insults of whites is that while 57% of white voters voted for a candidate other than Barack Obama, that&rsquo;s a nationwide average, and there are widely varying regional, cultural and ideological reasons for those differences.</p>
<p>For instance, I&rsquo;m sure that Obama got at least 80% of white votes in San Francisco, but he got almost no white votes in Mississippi.  Meanwhile, you can bet that the black vote was near monolithic for Obama in San Francisco, Mississippi and everywhere else.</p>
<p>The reason why Obama ultimately won is because David Axelrod&rsquo;s triangulation on foreign trade (phony as it was) shifted enough white voters in critical swing states like Ohio, and a general visceral reaction to the state of the economy.  In freakish tragedies like Indiana and North Carolina, I am told that white conservatives in those states were especially despondent about the Republican Party&rsquo;s putrid nominee.</p>

			<p>Curiously, Ayers and Dohrn do not examine the voting patterns of non-whites, which are vastly more monolithic than those of white voters. Isn&rsquo;t the fact that 95% or so of blacks can be counted on to support black politicians a symptom of &#8220;racism&#8221; in &#8220;the black community?&#8221;<br>

			<p>The fact that 43% of whites voted for a left wing black with no experience, radical friends, a racist pastor and a bigoted wife is amazing.  At most, no more than 25% of whites should have voted for him.  The fact that almost half of the whites voted for Obama shows that whites have no racial solidarity or identity.  That&rsquo;s the problem.  All the other groups have no hesitation showing racial unity.  How bad does it have to get before whites wake up and unify.</p>

			<p>Obama and his wife endorsed Bill Ayers&rsquo; book on juvenile justice. IIRC the book lamented that too many blacks were in prison and called on the police to stop harrassing these innocent victims of &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>

<p>This is true, but we must not forget that many conservatives are aiding race mixing.  Looking at most right wingers today, they are either supporters of diversity, or they simply give lip service to white people.  </p>
<p>A few nights ago, Bill O&rsquo;Reilly was saying that the whole firefighters incident was discrimination against white people.  That&rsquo;s all well and good, but do you see Bill supporting something more radical like the preservation of white lands?  He wouldn&rsquo;t touch that with a 20 ft. pole.  Like most conservatives, he gives lip service every now and then, but is not at all dedicated to aiding white people.</p>

			<p>So now we are told that we have to vote for a Black or else we are racists? I say, go ahead and call me that word all you want, it is just a word to try to lay even more guilt on Whites and bleed us dry. I have never felt any guilt for being White, just the opposite as a matter of fact. I am a proud White who is totally proud of my heritage and proud of those who created and built this nation.</p>

			<p>In fairness, when asked about white privilege I use these two idiots as an example. If you think of the crimes they commited, if they were black they would still be in jail not working for a law firm and whit imortant universities. They are the prime example of white priviledge. Any liberal hearing this tends to become uncomfortable. </p>

			<p>So 57% of whites didn&rsquo;t vote for barack hussien, ok, well what about the almost 97% of blacks who voted for him? I suppose his skin color had nothing to do with that. So less than three percent of all of the blacks in America voted for John McCain. If that is not an example of anti-white racism, I don&rsquo;t know what is. And furthermore, why people even care what those two criminals say is beyond me. America needs to wake up and realize the direction these people are taking this nation.</p>

			<p>Okay, so 57% of White Americans might not have voted for Obama, The Magnificent&hellip; So what does that really mean? That they voted against him because of his race? Or they voted against him because he was a Democrat? Or they voted against him based on Obama&rsquo;s outspoken socialist views?</p>
<p>Or could it have been something as simple as the reality McFumble being seen as little more than a geriatric clone of G.W.B. and Bush&rsquo;s ill-conceived wars; Palin as hopelessly inept and incompetent should McCain have died in office?</p>
<p>Claiming Obama failed to win 57% of White votes&hellip; without providing solid reasons is in itself an empty, even provocative statement</p>

			<p>So almost all blacks who voted had voted for Obama because he was black, yet the whites who didn&rsquo;t vote for blacks are &#8216;racist&rsquo; automatically, period, no argument, end of statement.  Isn&rsquo;t that racist to assume because of one&rsquo;s skin color that they should vote for someone/not because of their skin color?  I would rather have a conservative black like Thomas Sowell or Larry Elder or Jesse Lee Peterson.</p>

			<p>How come they never analyze non-white behavior?  Many blacks are racist - very racist - and many were so racist they never voted until a black man ran for office.  Last year, how many stories did you read about how blacks were voting for the first time???  Far too many.  And they can&rsquo;t say they didn&rsquo;t have opportunity to vote for a white that didn&rsquo;t pander to blacks.  For crying out loud, they&rsquo;re all over the country   &mdash;  - and in office!<br>

			<p>Ultimately the racism of the Chinese will be the issue for the left in the USA. As the century proceeds on its way, and we see and experience the force of Chinese National Socialism, it will become harder for the left to argue for its universalist ideals; there won&rsquo;t be a Socialist country anywhere that is not falling into dust. Chinese forces are going to conquer Africa and do it boldly; any arguments Ayers et al can muster to appeal to Socialist &#8220;brotherhood&#8221; will be laughed at. Come to think of it, they are laughing at Obama now.</p>

<p>Just exactly what media is he talking about? Even though he doesn&rsquo;t qualify his phrase &#8220;the media&#8221; it can&rsquo;t be the MSM he&rsquo;s talking about. </p>
<p>A YouTube video had a great example of how the MSM operated in the last election. Two issues of <i>Us</i> magazine: the one with Michelle Obama on the cover featured the gushing puff piece &#8220;Why She Loves Him&#8221; (Mr. Obama). The cover of the same magazine with Sarah Palin featured the shock headline &#8220;Palin&rsquo;s Baby Scandal!&#8221; The fact is, Palin was portrayed by the MSM as a narrow-minded &#8220;aw shucks&#8221; backwoods idiot.</p>
<p>Of course, in the bizarro, inverted world of people like Ayers and Dohrn, the only thing one would expect is the complete opposite of reality.</p>

			<p>The people such as Ayers are so incredibly despicable that I actually hope that a fairly significant number of them continue to exist. Because regular, red-blooded Americans are still incredibly ignorant of the SDS/Weather Underground types (you truly have to meet them in order to know how bad they are), most Whites still buy into the notion that we can live in a multiracial/multicultural society peacefully and happily. But as soon as said red-blooded Americans start realizing the people behind the invention of such notions, they will certainly be driven to white nationalism.</p>
<p>I was attacked very severely by the SDS back when I was in college, and the kind of sinister vileness with which they conduct themselves is truly stomach-turning. I only wish that more Whites could have that experience, not because I want to see them suffer, but because I think that that is the only way by which Whites will actually wake up. They need shock treatment, and God knows that the media won&rsquo;t give it to them  &mdash;  the establishment culture definitely fosters such radical leftism, but it doesn&rsquo;t advertise that fact because it knows the consequences. It allows weak and powerless Whites to get mauled, but it never really reveals the true nature of the Dragon. In other words, even though from time to time the media reports on conservatives&rsquo; getting mauled, it focuses almost solely on the mauling itself, not at all on the groups and the kinds of people conducting such attacks. If those people were ever exposed, there truly could be a huge backlash against them.</p>

			<p>I refuse to vote for a non-White on the same racist premise that non-Whites use to vote for their own kind.  </p>

			<p>Who feeds these people? Is there a job called acting like a horse`s rear end stirring up the rabble to burn down the town.<br>
     I am politcally close to Attila the Hun; however these geeks have nothing on me when it comes to anti-war. You all know that I think the entire thing was a conspiracy to use up, grind up, and bury up all our Scots-Irish seed corn. The only people who will resist the Ivy League hegonomists and their Chineeze masters when the take over starts.<br>
     I don`t see these race traitors mourning the kids weekly being sent home in pieces and in boxes to Gatlinburg; Beckely; Darlington; and every other place where poverty and patriotism encourge the descendants of Daniel Boone, David Crocket, and Abraham Lincoln to wage war so the rich white Ivy leaguers can sit on their behinds this summer at the Hamptons.<br>

			<p>Ayres and Dohrn harbor genocidal intentions towards Native Born White Americans. It is as simple as this. The scary thing is that millions of Native-Born White Americans have no idea what&rsquo;s in store for them in future.<br>

<p>Exactly. Dohrn has even said so. It&rsquo;s documented. Many people will have to be disposed of. She states she is still a radical today, every bit as much so as ever. She repents nothing.  These are two committed fanatics who have devoted their lives to the &#8220;cause&#8221;.   </p>
<p>I consider that Mrs. and Mr. Bernadine Dorhn are two of the most dangerous people in America today.  And our current White House occupant is beholden to them. That&rsquo; scary!<br>

			<p>I am a WASP who absolutely refused to vote for Obama because he defended the L.A. rioters and the Jena 6, plus he very much ignores his white heritage. I&rsquo;d respect him more if he were all black. At least then there&rsquo;d be no problem with his identifying himself entirely with that race. </p>

			<p>I am certain that over 90% of all black voters voted for Obama.  Somehow that&rsquo;s never cited as proof of their racism.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Michelle Obama has become the queen, not just of America, but of the world,&rdquo; Ayers said.</i></p>
<p>Earth to Ayers:  This country is supposed to be a republic.  We don&rsquo;t have queens.</p>

			<p>Reasons I, a white woman, did not vote for Obama:</p>
<p>1.  He&rsquo;s a liberal Marxist.<br>
2.  There is a lot of doubt concerning his citizenship.<br>
3.  Like the Bushes, Clinton, etc., he won&rsquo;t uphold the Constitution.<br>

			<p>Why are Ayers and Dohrn not in prison? Surely there are active warrants for their arrest? didn&rsquo;t they kill people in the &lsquo;70&rsquo;s? There&rsquo;s no statute of limitations for murder.</p>
<p>Yes, people were killed and they are not in jail now because they are the ones that made the current BLACK President. Like Pakistan having nuclear weapons now which makes Pakistan UNTOUCHABLE MILITARILY their association with the pres makes them UNTOUCHABLE.</p>

			<p>Reasons I, a white woman/man, did not vote for Obama:</p>
<p>1. He&rsquo;s black<br>
2. I have seen evidence of how a black run government works<br>
3. He&rsquo;s black<br>
4. He will appoint as many blacks and muslims as he can.<br>
5. Did I mention he&rsquo;s black?</p>

			<p> Last year, how many stories did you read about how blacks were voting for the first time???</p>
<p>Right, even DEAD ones, and some liked the experience so much they voted multiple times!</p>

			<p>Obama could arm his buddies to form a militia for the next election. White precints would have minimum turnout as residents would be &#8216;persuaded&rsquo; by the Ayers/Dohrn militia to stay home.</p>
<p>Trust me. This scenario is mild compared with what this duo of lunacy did and advocated in the late sixties and early seventies. Dohrn especially was a very violent lady. It is amazing that the government was unable to send her to jail for life, but apparently the case was botched under who? Oh yes. Jimmy Carter. How did that phony get away with aiding and abetting these dangerous terrorists? </p>
<p>Something stinks also about Obama that has never been fully revealed. I believe this odd fellow who was a nobody until an organizing meeting and fundraiser at Ayers home was held. This was the launching pad for Obama&rsquo;s legislative campaigns. How could two fugitives from the FBI have achieved such prominence in Chicago&rsquo;s financial, academic and political circles? Who else was at the initial Ayers organizing meeting? What pledges were made? What obligations secured?</p>
<p>Obama as a political being was shaped by Dohrn and Ayers. He now is their remote control weapon. What they ultimately have planned given Obama&rsquo;s access to nuclear and bio weapons no one knows, but this is a dedicated gang that will never relinquish is dream to destroy America. Is Obama their tool?</p>
