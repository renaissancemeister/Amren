<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-everify14-2009may14,0,7963143.story">E-Verify Program Confirming Workers&rsquo; Legal Status Grows in Popularity</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anna Gorman, Los Angeles Times, May 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 124,000 businesses, including nearly 10,000 in California, are signed up for the Web-based identification program that enables employers to check whether an employee is authorized to work, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Among the employers enrolled in the state are restaurants, hospitals and temporary employment agencies.</p>
<p>Last week the Obama administration announced that it wanted Congress to allocate $12 million more to the program in the next fiscal year, bringing its budget to $112 million. And Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in a congressional hearing that the program was &#8220;a cornerstone of workplace enforcement across the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Napolitano said the government planned to improve the accuracy of the databases and strengthen the training of employers to protect workers against discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the end of June, all federal contractors and subcontractors will be required to begin using it. Last fiscal year, more than 6.6 million names were checked under the program, according to the citizenship agency.</p>
<p>E-Verify is an effective way to attack the jobs magnet for illegal immigrants, said Roy Beck, executive director of Numbers USA, which favors stricter controls on immigration. Beck said he hoped the increase in funding would result in more employers signing up.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Angela Kelley, vice president for immigration policy at think tank the Center for American Progress, said E-Verify was not &#8220;ready for prime time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Supporters frame this as an immigration enforcement solution,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s really American workers having to ask the government for permission to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Business groups generally support E-Verify but criticize the error rate. The government reports that the program has a 96% accuracy rate. But even a small error rate could disqualify millions of workers if the program were to be expanded to the entire workforce, said Randel Johnson, vice president of labor, immigration and employee benefits for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Despite that, many businesses want to be on the right side of the law and are willing to try out the system if it helps protect them from inadvertently hiring undocumented workers, said Tamar Jacoby, president of ImmigrationWorks USA, a national federation of employers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why many agricultural companies haven&rsquo;t signed on, said Bryan Little, director for labor affairs for the California Farm Bureau. Little said he worried about having enough people to work the fields.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not in our benefit to hire illegal workers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The way the marketplace looks right now, farmers don&rsquo;t have a better option available to them.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I would like to bet anyone that this fails. In fact, in the present political climate, I would bet anyone, that nothing substantial at all, is ever going to be done to stop the invasion of foreign nationals from Mexico mainly, and other places as well. Americans are NOT, in control of their own nation. Some of them just can&rsquo;t get that through their heads. Going out and voting, isn&rsquo;t being in charge of your nation, when your vote is negated by the traitorous actions of your &#8220;rerpresetatives&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Business groups generally don&rsquo;t support E-Verify and the lobbying before Congress bears witness to that.  If they did there would be 100% voluntary participation.</p>
<p>I also belive that the Center for American Progress will never support it even if it were 100% accurate.  Just like La Raza or the SPLC.     </p>

			<p>I think the reason it is so popular is that it extricates many employers in illegal alien heavy areas from the Catch 22 they are in.  On the one hand, they can (and should) be punished mightily if they hire illegals.  On the other hand, if they ask prospective employees re immig status, they&rsquo;ll sue for racial profiling.</p>

			<p>Any statistics or testimonials to verify if this does or does not work? Does this system cross reference Social Security numbers for fraudulent use? Anyone know?</p>

			<p>&#8221;&rsquo;&hellip;many businesses want to be on the right side of the law and are willing to try out the system if it helps protect them from inadvertently hiring undocumented workers,&rsquo; said Tamar Jacoby, president of ImmigrationWorks USA, a national federation of employers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tamar Jacoby is a traiterous open borders shill who thinks Americans should have to compete for their jobs in the domestic economy with everyone in the world. It certainly doesn&rsquo;t occur to her that this might jeopardize our national security, wreck salaries for white collar jobs (like computer programing), and raise unemployment and depress wages for blue collar workers.</p>
<p>The economic value of immigration to US citizens is a wash at best   &mdash;   in the public sector and in the economic long term, it&rsquo;s definitely a huge negative, filling America with inassimilable foreigners who don&rsquo;t believe in rule of law and are here just for the cash.</p>

			<p>I would guess it&rsquo;s going to take The American People to do a job The American Government won&rsquo;t do&hellip; to rid our nation of 30 million illegal aliens. For starters, REPORT any business you suspect of hiring illegal aliens. Law of averages being that if a business has ten Mexican employers, several at the very least will turn out to be illegal aliens.</p>

<p>Sadly, I have to agree with Bobby. Our representatives all to often demonstrate that they don&rsquo;t care about their constituents as soon as they get elected. It also seems that, like a Somali refugee that can NEVER be deported, these treacherous politicians can NEVER be UN-elected.</p>

			<p>I saw this article when it was originally posted on the LA Times website. Accuracy is still a big issue with E-Verify, and until they get that worked out to much more acceptable error rate (as well as a mechanism to dispute the results in a timely fashion) this program will be a tough sell. Here&rsquo;s another article with more information: E-Verify - The Complete Guide</p>
<p>Despite the drawbacks (which I think will be worked out in time) I think E-Verify has potential. It certainly beats the current hodge-podge of laws and practices that are currently in place.</p>

			<p>Last year, there was a bill in the house of reps. called the SAVE act, which would have required all employers to check the legal status of their workers. Naturally, san francisico nancy would never allow such a bill to be voted on so a &#8216;discharge petition&rsquo; was circulted which would have forced a vote on the legislation if it got a certain number of signatures.  But a significant numbers of dems. who supposedly &#8216;supported&rsquo; SAVE refused to sign it, so the bill eneded up dying. Employers should be required to check the status of workers and as a side note, birthrighht citizenship, free public schooling and non-emergency medical care should be denied to all aliens.Of course, both parties refuse to do this(or anything)to stop the invasion. </p>

			<p><i>&#8220;On the other hand, if they ask prospective employees re immig status, they&rsquo;ll sue for racial profiling.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>A provision of Reagan&rsquo;s &#8220;ONE TIME ONLY&#8221; amnesty was proof of legal residency.</p>
<p>I have changed jobs many times since Reagan was in office and this &#8220;ONE TIME ONLY&#8221; plan was passed. Although I&rsquo;m a native born, white male, I&rsquo;ve been asked by every employer to provide legal documentation. It&rsquo;s an annoyance for me because I know the reason behind it but I accept it because it&rsquo;s supposed to be the standard employer practice in the US. If this system had been followed since day one, we wouldn&rsquo;t have this problem right now with illegals. This provision was supposed to stop illegals from being hired.</p>
<p>My point about your point is that if this system had been followed by everyone (including others like me), then there&rsquo;s no way of claiming racial profiling. If everyone has to follow the same procedures, no one is being singled out.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s the theory. I&rsquo;m sure even if it was applied to everyone, it&rsquo;s &#8216;disparate impact&rsquo; on illegal aliens would be used as &#8216;proof&rsquo; of racism; even if the results were the purpose of the provision.<br>

			<p>E-Verify is actually even more accurate than reported here.  99.6% accuracy rate currently and will get even better when DHS finishes putting passport data into database.  Takes less than one minute per employee, with almost all LEGAL employees verifying on the system in 5 seconds.  Those who get flagged by the system have a 2 or 3 month window to get their proper documents in order, or they are deemed as non-authorized to work here.  It&rsquo;s FREE to employers, Web-based, and is the absolute best kryptonite we have in the fight against illegals&hellip;it takes the job magnet and REVERSES THE POLARITY!</p>
