			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Los Angeles Times, May 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s no excuse for legalizing discrimination, which is precisely what would happen under a state ballot initiative now in the signature-gathering stage and targeted for next year&rsquo;s June election. If passed, it would require all parents of newborns in California to prove U.S. citizenship or legal residency in order to receive their baby&rsquo;s birth certificate. Those who could not would have to pay a $75 fee for a certificate noting the child&rsquo;s &#8220;Birth to a Foreign Parent.&#8221; The U.S. Department of Homeland Security would be alerted to the discrepancy. And finally, in willful ignorance of previous California Supreme Court rulings, the measure would attempt to deny health benefits to illegal immigrants. Those are federally mandated benefits, beyond the reach of state law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although neither the U.S. Supreme Court nor Congress has ever explicitly ruled on whether the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants are entitled to citizenship under the 14th Amendment, the assumption has long been that they are. If there are genuine doubts about whether that assumption is wrong, then let&rsquo;s have that debate. But don&rsquo;t sneak it into an initiative promoted as a tool to &#8220;reduce crime&#8221; and keep deported criminal &#8220;aliens&#8221; from returning to the U.S. because their citizen children are here.</p>

			<p>&#8220;California ballot initiative to require parents of newborns to prove legal status.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way too late to make any kind of difference at all.</p>
<p>However, my advice to California Democrats is to take into serious consideration the fact that California is imploding right this minute and will be bankrupt totally in two years, maybe less.</p>
<p>Too, I would like to ask each of them this: How are you going to feed the hungry masses you are encouraging to come to your state?</p>
<p>When people are hungry, have no jobs, and no hope, nor visible means of support, they will lose it completely.  Desperate people are the stuff armed insurrections are made of.</p>
<p>If it unfolds as I expect, there will be many Democrat demagogues who will lose their wealth to mob action.  And, it couldn&rsquo;t happen to a more deserving bunch.</p>
<p>What goes around, comes around.</p>

			<p>I have always marveled at the Los Angeles Times skill in how they make headlines sound, for example, </p>
<p>&#8220;Targeting Illegal Immigrants&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds so heartless,so inhumane. Let&rsquo;s change the title a bit to,</p>
<p>&#8220;Targeting Illegal Immigration&#8221;,</p>
<p>now this just wouldn&rsquo;t do it for the Times. There&rsquo;s no emotional impact. No tear jerking response. In fact, most people would probably agree, &#8220;Illegal immigration? Sure, let&rsquo;s target it&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Fancy the L.A. Times calling for debate on this issue. The entire tenor of Times immigration coverage is mixed outrage and bathos  &mdash;  for opponents and immigrants, respectively. As for racial issues, it is the standard MSM &#8220;hit them with Hitler&#8221; hysterics. Judging from the above clips it seems they are gearing up for more of the same. But there is good news, the ethnic and racial issues behind immigration are discussed openly now, and arbiters of taste, like the Times, can no longer halt the flow of factual information.</p>

			<p>I hope the ballot spreads to other states. Most states, unlike the border states, are ill equiped to deal with or even recognize illegals and there is little enforcement or even questioning of a persons resident status. Local construction sites, grounds works and road crews look like southern cali already here in S.C. One mobile home with apparently 15 people living in it with 5 or 6 BRAND NEW Ford trucks in front!! AND two soccer vans. I say get legal or get the hell out.</p>

			<p>If being a foreigner who has illegally entered the country and who is trying to use free services paid for by Americans is not a justification for discrimination, what is?  Answer: Being a White man.  </p>

			<p>I love it when illegals whine that you shouldn&rsquo;t break up families.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s an idea  &mdash;  Everyone head back to Mexico or wherever you came from, you can all be together there!</p>
<p>BTW an &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; is not an American citizen.  First off, the 14th Amendment was never really ratified.  Secondly, even if it were, whoever wrote it never intended for it to mean that anchor babies would be citizens.</p>

			<p>I can only say that lines have to be drawn somewhere.  Even if the ballot initiative fails, just getting it out for the vote is much better than just griping about it on sites such as this.</p>
<p>I personally believe that there are a great number of liberals who WANT to see the U.S. (or at least California) to implode so they can &#8220;re-make&#8221; it in the Marxist-Leninist image they seem to love so much.</p>
<p>Look at the bright side - the socialist liberals who truly support illegal immigration will only be forced more into the light if they have to campaign against the ballot initiative!</p>

			<p>&#8220;t would require &#8220;all parents&#8221; of newborns in California to prove U.S. citizenship or legal residency in order to receive their baby&rsquo;s birth certificate.&#8221;</p>
<p>If it requites &#8220;all parents,&#8221; then how can it be discriminatory? But I&rsquo;m sure the liberal courts will find a way to twist the meaning.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;If there are genuine doubts about whether that assumption is wrong, then let&rsquo;s have that debate&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>YOU in the LA Times want a debate?  This from a decidedly leftist rag that constantly champions the rights of illegal immigrants at the expense of taxpaying Whites?   A cat box liner that prints 10 pro-illegal immigrant &#8216;rights&rsquo; editorials and letters to the editor for every one from an anti-illegal immigrant writer?  </p>
<p>YOU in the LA Times that fall all over yourselves to print incessant illegal sob stories on the front pages and refuse to report the massive amount of crime, including drunk driving, that illegals have brought into California?  Why do you refuse to report the massive financial burden illegals cost the taxpayers of the state of California  &mdash;  costs such as educational services, welfare, section 8, food stamps, medical care?  </p>
<p>Why not blast a story on the front pages of your paper of all the neighborhoods that have been destroyed due to unfettered, decades-long, Third World illegal immigration?   You could include before and after pictures illustrating how entire cities have &#8216;morphed&rsquo; from quiet, clean and crime-free to gang-ridden, graffiti covered, weed-filled hell-holes marked by broken down cars on blocks, run-down houses, trash filled gutters.  How about interviewing a few White Californians (for once)  &mdash;  ask them how they feel about the changes in their quality of life.  Ask them, for once, what they think of the high, confiscatory taxes that are used to pay for services for illegals and their children. </p>
<p>You will never print such stories because it does not fit your agenda of multiculturalism, open borders and especially the goal of the destruction of White Western Civilization.</p>
<p>Ironic, isn&rsquo;t it, that the group you pander to, low IQd, unskilled, non-English speaking parasites, cannot read your paper.  The group you daily insult, Whites in general and White Californians in particular, have dropped their subscriptions in droves.</p>
<p>USA Today reports, in its April 27, 2009 edition:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Circulation declines at the nation&rsquo;s newspapers are accelerating.<br>
The most recent drop was faster than the 4.6% fall in April-September 2008, and the 3.6% fall in October 2007-March 2008.</p>
<p>The New York Times&rsquo; daily circulation fell 3.6% to 1,039,031, while the Los Angeles Times saw a drop of 6.6% to 723,181&hellip;&#8221;</p>

			<p>This state ballot initiative is a good sign and needs to be supported.  As many states are now working on state laws to strengthen them against further Federal intervention and control it will take sometime but this insanity has to stop before we are buried.  </p>
<p>Our country is broke and is going into massive debt on a daily basis, the fat is long gone and economist don&rsquo;t see this recession ending with a large jump, if at all in GDP.</p>
<p>This let the world in and stay forever policy has not been a good idea for the past 40 years.  Now uncontrolled immigration is a suicidal policy.  The madness must stop.</p>
<p>Remember, the good ole 9th circuit is in Califronia just waiting to to impose their insanity on us as well.   While the Messiah is looking for a soclialist lefty for the SCOTUS opening and planning for another 2 replacements in his first term.</p>

<p>Right on!!!!!</p>
<p>I started thinking about that 25 years ago when I moved to Los Angeles. The Times did nothing but trash Whites and exhalt immigrant and black criminals and job thieves who reduced formerly well paid jobs such as construction to starvation wages.</p>
<p>I did write a letter to the editor about that subject.  What will you do when the last White person who can read English leaves Los Angeles??  Needless to say, the letter was not published.</p>
<p>Looks like my prediction has come true.  And all I can say is good, good, good.</p>

			<p>Leave it to the left wing LA Times to say that this ballot measure is &#8220;legalizing discrimination&#8221;.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it passes or not though, because the left wing California judges will toss it out.  We have been living in a dictatorship of the left for some time now.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the article gives me another reason to feel a warm, fuzzy glow when I read about the dismal financial state of our newspapers.</p>

<p><br>
Then that shows that they (whoever they are) who run the L.A. Times have put ideology above all else, so great is their commitment to Multiculturalism/Pluralism/Diversity. Obviously their &#8220;agenda&#8221; comes first.</p>
