<h1><a href="/articles/2009/05/11/news/local_news/localnews0000000001.txt">President Obama Pushes to Close Black Farmers&rsquo; Lawsuit</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>St. Louis American, May 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama has announced plans to include $1.250 billion in settlement funds in the 2010 budget to bring closure to the long-standing Black farmers&rsquo; lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the White House has announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an issue I worked on in the Senate, and I&rsquo;m pleased that we are now able to close this chapter in the agency&rsquo;s history and move on,&#8221; the President said in a release. &#8220;My hope is that the farmers and their families who were denied access to USDA loans and programs will be made whole and will have the chance to rebuild their lives and their businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>The White House is describing the potential settlement as &#8220;just one part of a larger strategy at USDA to improve civil rights enforcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very pleased that President Obama is taking swift action on this matter as it is something that will help us chart a new course at USDA, one on which all USDA customers and employees are treated equally and fairly,&#8221; says Agriculure Secretary Tom Vilsack said.</p>
<p>A White House statement describes the sins of the U. S. government.</p>
<p>&#8220;For decades in the last century, USDA had a spotted history of discriminating against black farmers in its loan programs and subsidy programs. In 1999, the USDA entered into a consent agreement with black farmers where the agency agreed to pay these farmers for past discrimination in lending and other USDA programs. While thousands of those claims have been adjudicated, thousands of other black farmers never had a chance for their claims to be considered on the merits because of problems with the notification and claims process that made it very difficult for many farmers to participate,&#8221; said a White House statement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the White House statement, the $1.250 billion will be used to allow those farmers who filed a claim in the original Pigford case, &#8220;but whose claim was never considered on the merits because the claim was found not to be timely, have the right to file a new claim in federal court.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lase week, Vilsack detailed plans to promote civil rights and equal access at USDA. A memo issued by him announced the following:</p>
<p>o &#8220;The temporary suspension of all foreclosures within the Farm Service Agency&rsquo;s farm loan program, {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>o &#8220;The creation of a Task force to conduct a review of a sample of program civil rights complaints that have been processed or that are currently being processed  &mdash;  the complaints and inquiries total over 14,000, including over 3,000 that have not been processed;&#8221;</p>
<p>o and &#8220;Granting greater authority to USDA&rsquo;s Office of Civil Rights. {snip}&#8221;</p>

		<p>Maybe it is harder to get a loan because black people are not the most credit worthy race. This is how the subprime scandal wrecked the economy. It became &ldquo;racist&rdquo; to verify credit worthiness. Banks don&rsquo;t care about the color of your skin, they want to lend money! Provided the person is credit worthy. This is just going to sink the economy even further! Probably kill it all toghter. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The temporary suspension of all foreclosures within the Farm Service Agency&rsquo;s farm loan program&hellip;. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet the &ldquo;ALL&rdquo; does not include foreclosures on WHITE PEOPLE. I guess taxpayers get to pay their mortgages too? <br>

		<p>This lawsuit has always been a giant rip off of taxpayer money with no basis in fact.  AmRen did a masterful job in its investigation that exposed this fraud for what it is.  AMREN&rsquo;S investigation &#8220;Who wants to be a Black Millionsaire?&#8221; is located in its February 2001 archive.  Recommended reading!</p>

		<p>The only &#8220;black farmers&#8221; I&rsquo;ve ever seen were the convicts working on Prison Farms in TX.  I suppose there are a few blacks growing patches of marijuana here and there, or have a tomato plant in a pot, but how many real farmers are there who are black?</p>

		<p>This program is nothing but a giant scam, like some form of reparations, handing out taxpayers money to people who in no way deserve it. Any politican who voted for this program is absolutely shameless. </p>

		<p>Why is it that I&rsquo;m not surprised he&rsquo;s doing this? Oh, right, take a look at his skin   &mdash;   he&rsquo;s just serving his own people. </p>
<p>Right, because who really cares about $1.25 billion? Obama won&rsquo;t have to pay for it, but us working folk will.</p>
<p>Disgusting.</p>

		<p>My family farmed next to several black farmers. They would take the gov. money plant and never return to the field again. They never harvested a thing. To be participate the farmer must plant and then was left alone to farm as best they could. It made me angry to be working our fields and watching their &#8220;weed patches&#8221; grow. Some years they came out better than we did. <br>
I cannot tell you how happy we were after many years when the gov. figured out that these guys were not real farmers and discontinued their farm loans and subsidies. Hey way to go US gov, ten years plus of loans and payments and you can not show one ear of corn or boll of cotton harvested. You are not a farmer but a con artist. They should have been jailed for fraud. <br>
So my hard working 73 yr. old dad works on. The black farmers will be made wealthy and relax. Dad has made tons upon ton of food and fiber sine 1961 he gets nada. Those who never produced a thing get rewarded. Sounds like an analogy of liberalism.<br>

<p>No one reading this could mistake the culprit as anything but the U.S. government. Anyone remember when a Secretary of Agriculture was appointed for D.C.!!!!! NO FARM LAND IN D.C. hahahaha the position caused lots of &#8216;outrage&rsquo; but was typical of the U.S. government then AND now.</p>

		<p>Black farmers??? I have lived in Africa all my life and I have seen a multitude of black subsistence farming, if you can even call it that but I am still waiting to encounter a commercial black farmer.</p>

		<p>Black Farmers probably enjoy attending the Black Rodeos that their brethren the Black Ranchers put on. Afterwards, they fly together in Magical Black Egyptian Pyramids to some successfully administered, black-run Country in Black Africa where they spectate at either one of the successful launchings or landings of the Black African Space Program. After all of this, the Black Farmers and Black Ranchers retire to their farmhouses and bunkhouses to rest and round out the evening by some light (or should I say dark?) studying of Ancient Black African Architecture and Sub-Saharan Black African Literary Masterpieces.</p>
