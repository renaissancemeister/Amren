			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Coen, Chicago Tribune, May 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A transcript of a secretly recorded phone call between the brother of former Gov. Rod Blagojevich and U.S. Sen. Roland Burris was released in federal court today, a call in which Burris, then seeking the Senate seat, was recorded offering the Blagojevich campaign a campaign check.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I could give him a check,&#8221; Burris said. &#8220;Myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in the same call, Burris tells Robert Blagojevich he is concerned he and Rod Blagojevich will &#8220;catch hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I do get appointed that means I bought it,&#8221; Burris said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, and God knows number one, I, I wanna help Rod,&#8221; Burris says later in the call. &#8220;Number two, I also wanna, you know, hope I get a consideration to get that appointment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Burris was recorded saying the timing would be crucial to how the fundraising would be perceived.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Burris did not specifically mention offering Blagojevich a check in affidavits he filed in Springfield in connection with hearings on Blagojevich&rsquo;s impeachment. On a &#8220;good will&#8221; tour around the state in February, Burris addressed a conversation he had with Blagojevich&rsquo;s brother, Robert, during the fall timeframe.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>Before you get so quick to toss Roland Burris to the side, you better be careful what you wish for, as you might well get it.  Guess what they&rsquo;re running up the flagpole to replace Burris?  None other than Chris Kennedy, RFK&rsquo;s fifth son.  Evidently, he moved to Chicago so that the Kennedy Empire could colonize Illinois, and did something semi-important at something called &#8220;Merchandise Mart,&#8221; which happens to be Kennedy family owned.</p>
<p>All those years RFK pandered to blacks, and here his son wants to disenfranchise a black man.</p>

<p>Not gonna happen, this seat belongs to blacks now and they will NEVER give it up. Roland Burris will NEVER be removed no matter what he is guilty of, if anything, BECAUSE!! he is black. Jackson Jr. may replace him possibly BUT!! the seat will remain black.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s a case of a black who has been caught doing something which could be illegal, if more info comes in proving that contention, or, at the very least, he is guilty of gross ethics violations, yet he is disingenuously rapidly chattering in the face of all reason and logic, thinking he can con whitey into believing he&rsquo;s always been on the up and up.</p>
<p>Typical black behavior when they get caught with their hands in the cookie jar.  Yes, there are whites who do this too, but blacks far and away engage is such silly attempts.  In fact, most of them do.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m from Illinois, and let me tell you what is commonly known here: No one makes it into higher office in the Chicago area unless they are corrupt   &mdash;   unless they &#8220;play the game.&#8221;  Honest politicians simply cannot make it, because of the way the system works there.  You should immediately suspect ANY politician who came out of Chicago.  </p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t one Senate seat in Illinois all but a set aside for blacks? Democrat Carol Moseley Braun. Democrat Barack Hussein Obama. Democrat Roland Burris. And the Republicans, ever mindful of the necessity of racial pandering, put Alan Keyes up for that position. <br>

			<p>An honest US Senate would have simply refused to confirm anyone appointed by Blagojevich.  That&rsquo;s not what we have, however.  We have a Senate that has repeatedly voted for more H-1b visas and more entitlements, and wants illegal alien amnesty.  </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be so certain that Burris is going to skate on this one, howeever.  Political corruption is an actual felony, as I am sure Vietnam ace and former congressman Randy &#8220;Duke&#8221; Cunningham understands.  If a grand jury indicts Burris, the matter is out of the Senate&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>Randy is White, Buriss is BLACK! wanna re-think that statement given current political circumstances? One mustn&rsquo;t outrage the blacks.</p>
