<h1>Commissioner Peter Lawson Jones Demands Legislation to Encourage Minority Hiring</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Guillen, Cleveland Plain Dealer, May 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Cuyahoga County Commissioner Peter Lawson Jones pledged this morning to vote against all future requests for county assistance to fund private construction projects until the county passes legislation to encourage minority hiring by contractors.</p>
<p>Jones&rsquo; declaration ignited a heated debate during this morning&rsquo;s board meeting during which the commissioner accused the county prosecutor&rsquo;s office of not pursuing the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the conviction,&#8221; Jones told David Lambert, chief of the prosecutor&rsquo;s civil division that represents commissioners.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Lambert defended his office, saying federal and state laws prohibit counties from imposing race-based hiring programs of the kind demanded by Jones.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jones, who graduated from Harvard Law School, said the resolution would not mandate minority hiring quotas, which would be unconstitutional. He added that requiring compliance with the county&rsquo;s SBE program also is not unconstitutional.</p>

		<p>The only difference between formal race quotas and affirmative action is the difference between the objective and the subjective.  In fact, faced with the Hobson&rsquo;s Choice, I would rather have the hard and fast quotas than affirmative action, because at least white people would get something for sure.</p>

		<p>It should be whites that are demanding that the county government practice fair hiring. The Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority is 90% black. No whites need apply. The Regional Transit Authority is  at least 70% black. The rest of the County government is disproportionally black.</p>
<p>The blacks just don&rsquo;t have the apptitude or work ethic for construction. See Amren for &#8220;Blacks and Steel&#8221;. I&rsquo;m an engineer who has worked for decades in Cuyahoga County on various construction projects. The blacks are worse than incompetent. They are dangerous and devious. One job I was on hired a black and paid him union scale. (Davis-Bacon act). Naturally he couldn&rsquo;t actually work so they had him sit at a desk and attempt to be the time keeper. He ended up breaking into the tool room and stealing all the contractors power tools. This was some small contractor trying to make a living. Another job I was on, a school job, hired some black roofers. We had our inpection and it was unbelievable. Roof tar splatered all over architectural brick walls, major pieces of roof equiopment actually buried in the roof tar, and my favorite, a hammer embedded in the new roof. I looked at the contractor and school board rep and said &#8220;The only thing missing here are the empty 40 ouncers&#8221;. They didn&rsquo;t laugh!</p>
<p>The average white construction worker is a pretty resourceful person. On many of my projects I would go out in the field and get the opinion of the foreman on how best to approach a problem. They usually had good insight into how to the structure should fit together. They understand trig, math, and basic engineering concepts. The average black is just unable to perform trigonometry calculations which are required for many construction projects. Would you want to drive across a bridge put together by black ironworkers? The reality is the white guys would figure it out and the blacks would get some token job.</p>
<p>When I see this combined with all the misdeeds of the Obama administration, it just makes my blood boil. This country is being stolen from us, and the news mwedia refuses to print anything remotely critical of any black person. <br>
What will this country look like in ten years?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Harvard Law School grad says race-based hiring constitutional if done &ldquo;without quotas.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&#8220;Race-based and not quotas?&#8221;</p>
<p>Does everybody see what I mean when I say blacks get AA degrees and they can&rsquo;t reason in coherent terms?</p>
<p>Degrees from ANY university are becoming absolutely meaningless because so many of these kinds of blacks are awarded them on a quota system, yet display just plain stupidity, making it perfectly obvious they have less on the ball than a white janitor.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Jones, who graduated from Harvard Law School&hellip;&#8221; - no doubt after having gained admission, and graduated, due to the color of his skin.  Read &#8220;The Affirmative Action Hoax&#8221; and you&rsquo;ll realize how little a degree from an Ivy League school, in the hands of a black man, means. </p>

		<p>Whites should demand affirmative action for all the years they&rsquo;ve been discriminated against.  Go beyond asking for equal treatment, ask for redress for past wrongs.  If they say no accuse them of racism.  R.K.S.</p>

		<p>If quotas are the new thing is should only follow mathematical balance,  blacks make up 13% of the population so they should only receive 13% of mandatory employment, the rest should be up to good ol&rsquo; qualification. </p>

<p>Actually less than that. The black population is, by a considerable margin, younger than the white population. These figures skew income averages. In the case of not enough black school teachers for the children - there will never be enough, as long as the population of whites is older and the majority of the black population heavier tilted toward the younger and school aged. Whites are being dispossessed and it ends up being just another excuse to champion non-whites.  </p>

<p>I must respectfully disagree.  Any system that awards opportunity based on anything other than excellence will fail period.  Whatever x% is deemed demographically fair, there will have to be a lowering of standards to normalize the group.  Otherwise, it will become official that those minorities that got the job through the quota system did so because of skin colour and not proven competence in the field.  This will water down the profession, lower moral and displace those that paid their dues and actually deserve the position.</p>
<p>Our world is on fire and only the thinkers are afraid.</p>

<p>Very simply Cindy, to them, there would NEVER be enough blacks! </p>

		<p>Where was all this black talent when a white was president, except old Bubbah and the peanut man who was a Sunday school teacher?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see a photo lineup of all Obama&rsquo;s picks&hellip;.and employees&hellip;..to reveal what I believe will be at least 25% black which will be twice the black representation in the population.</p>
<p>No wonder blacks decry oppression and discrimination.  All these wonderful black intellects were never appointed by whites.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m betting ten to one that not a one of them could pass a general test on academic knowledge on a high school level.</p>
<p>Degrees are meaninglass today among blacks.  </p>
<p>I heard a kid say the other day that he passed his high school GED tests and that SOME colleges would recognize it for admittance, and after seeing his test papers and the questions asked, it made me wonder how anybody could think this accomplishment was secondary to actual graduation, when it was MORE valid than a diploma freely give just for attending class because the GED test taker had to actually know the subjects he was tested in or at least have a high level of comprehension.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m betting anyone who will take me on, that 99% of Obama&rsquo;s black picks couldn&rsquo;t pass the average high school GED tests, especially the one above from the dumbed down Harvard University.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite serious.</p>
