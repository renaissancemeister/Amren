<h1>Mansfield Flag Controversy Draws Worldwide Outrage</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carol Cavazos, KTVT-TV (Dallas-Fort Worth), May 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Debbie McLucas is one of four hospital supervisors at Kindred Hospital in Mansfield. Last week, she hung a three-by-five foot American flag in the office she shares with the other supervisors.</p>
<p>When McLucas came to work Friday, her boss told her another supervisor had found her flag offensive. &#8220;I was just totally speechless. I was like, &#8216;You&rsquo;re kidding me,&rsquo;&#8221; McLucas said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McLucas said the supervisor who complained has been in the United States for 14 years and is formerly from Africa. McLucas said that supervisor took down the flag herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;The flag and the pole had been placed on the floor,&#8221; McLucas said. But McLucas also said hospital higher-ups had told her some patients&rsquo; families and visitors had also complained.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was told it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if it was only one person,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It would have to come down.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several dozen people protested outside the Mansfield hospital Wednesday. And a receptionist at Kindred&rsquo;s headquarters told us they received many phone calls.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But [McLucas] says when she was first told the flag had to go, nobody mentioned anything about its size being the root of the problem.</p>

		<p>Oh the wonders of diversity.</p>
<p>Is anyone surprised?  This is a for-profit corporation we&rsquo;re talking about here.  Your loyalty is supposed to be with it, and not any antiquated notion of geography or people.  Get with the New World Order program.  Corporations uber alles.</p>
<p>This is why I am not a pure paleo-libertarian and not a lassiez-faire capitalist.  All that would mean is is that we would be the slaves of big corporations and not the slaves of big government.  The hard truth of the matter is that, for the average white American (and many non-whites, too), the most acute threat and prior restraint to the exercise of civil liberties is not the Federal government, or state or local governments, but the dictates of their supervisor and the big corporation s/he represents, and the fear of losing their jobs.</p>
<p>One would think that this story puts the corporations uber alles crowd over at the neocon blog Crud State in a Catch-22.  On the one hand, they fulminate against anyone who would dare suggest that individual citizens have rights such that the rights of corporations must be curtailed.  On the other hand, they want you to wave the flag and be patriotic, i.e. towards the corporations that are making a fortune from our invade the world mentality and actual practice thereof.  My prediction is that said bloggers will come down on the side of the corporation here.</p>
<p>If this supervisor doesn&rsquo;t like the American flag and the country he immigrated to so much, then he should go home.</p>

		<p>How many times have I written here that Americans essentially get what we deserve? I know it is a comment that rubs some people the wrong way, and perhaps the statement is a bit strong. However, what is the purpose of this forum? Are we devoting our time to posting here in order to feel good about ourselves? Join the liberal/progressives, if that&rsquo;s your aim. They&rsquo;ll tell you anything you want to hear.</p>
<p>It is unbelievable to think that hundreds if not thousands of American citizens should not have been at the hospital protesting and demanding the immediate firing of the African supervisor. How many Americans on the battle field I wonder, had as the last thing in their field of view, before being killed or wounded an American flag somewhere? Perhaps it was on their uniform, on some equipment, or on something nearby, the only thing reminding them of what they were even risking their lives for. This is the state, that this nation has come to, thanks to the many traitors that have worked their treason on it, in the past and now, as they tear down America&rsquo;s symbols and spirit.</p>

		<p>I can only believe that the patients and visitors who were &#8220;offended&#8221; by our nation&rsquo;s flag were also anti-American as was the supervisor and worker who orignally complained and removed the flag.</p>
<p> This event has proved to the rest of the world that as long as our borders and ports are wide open to the world, we&rsquo;ll have people like this coming in. As for the native born who was involved, I&rsquo;ll just put it down to stupidity or anti-Americanism. </p>

		<p>I heard somewhere else that Mrs. McLucas has a son serving in Afghanistan.I also noted with both interest and consternation that the complainant was from Africa, having arrived here some 14 years ago.The gall of these people amazes me.My son invaded Iraq in 2003 on day one of the conflict, left in November, went back for a year in &#8216;05-&#8216;06 and is going to Afghanistan in 3 weeks. Let me assure you that this &#8220;immigrant&#8221; who complained about the flag, may thank God that he was dealing with this woman rather than me. I can assure you that after some consultation, he would be packing his bags in search of more friendly shores.   </p>

		<p>Not to worry, this is just the tip of the iceberg, the opening salvo, so to speak. Soon there will be so many immigrants from every corner of the globe that find &#8220;Old Glory&#8221; offensive that flying or displaying it anywhere where anyone can see it will be considered totally unacceptable. The USA will not split asunder and die in a shower of flames, but simply crawl off into a corner and die without so much as a whimper. What a glory it was, and what a sad, sad fate awaits.</p>

		<p>I think my main question is why the flag was offensive? Was the person offended by her patriotism? Was he/she upset about America itself and if so why did this person choose to come to America. They must have realized they probably would see an American flag in America. It is long past time we quit giving in to these malcontents. If you don&rsquo;t like America, as the song goes, then leave it.</p>

		<p>In recent years some of my fellow New Yorkers have asked me why I always defend the Conferate Flag, not having ever spent even a day in the South.</p>
<p>I tell them one reason is that after the Stars and Bars disappear the Stars and Stripes will be next.</p>
<p>After all slavery existed for 86 years under the US flag but for only 4 years in the Confederacy, a far worse sin to the p.c. crowd.</p>

		<p>First it was the blacks and the liberal commie pinkos in the US raising hell about the Confederate battle banner.  That makes me so angry that I could bite the heads off nails.  This, though, has to be the absolute LIMIT.  Since it seems the &#8220;aggrieved&#8221; supervisor is female, Ms. McLucas should have given her a good ole&rsquo; hair pulling extravaganza. If the supervisor were male,then Ms. McLucas should have done some serious backside kicking.  It&rsquo;s tough for me to keep my language acceptable in polite society.  Don&rsquo;t surrender our flag!!!!   </p>

<p>Dear Anonymous, </p>
<p>When the PC crowd went after the Confederate Flag some years back, I predicted that this was just the beginning and the American flag would be next. How right I was. All those brainwashed Whites never stood up for the right to fly the Confederate Flag because it was &#8220;racist.&#8221; Hope they&rsquo;re all happy now! </p>

		<p>If the Black Savage doesn&rsquo;t like the American flag, then why did he leave Africa? Put his butt on a raft and send him back to that disease infested, famine ridden place he thinks is Paradise; Africa.</p>
<p>If that was my office, and they removed my American flag, I would have worn it on a belt buckle, the next day. I also would replace the U.S. flag, with a Confederate flag, which the Savage would like even less.</p>

		<p>Blacks in America do feel threatened by the American flag.  I think it represents to them a symbol of a united force that does not condone their no-account life-style.  White neighborhoods can be identified by all the American flags that routinely fly.  Black neighborhoods rarely fly American flags.  </p>

		<p>I am tired of people in this country, whether they were born here or invaded-I mean &#8216;immigrated&rsquo; to the US-complaining about our culture and symbols. &#8220;I find it offensive&#8221;  really? Well, you can always leave if you don&rsquo;t like it.  Should I go to Africa and tell them their symbols offend me?  Oh wait! Never mind.  I guess all I have to is walk through an inner city in America to get a glimpse of Africa. </p>

		<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a black from Africa or a black from the U.S., they really aren&rsquo;t a flag-waving people.  How many - other than black veterans - do you see at Veterans Day and Memorial Day rallies?  How many had the flag waving from their cars after 9/11?  Obama shunned the flag in the beginning as well.</p>

		<p>Here are a few things we can do.  Buy and display more American flags everywhere you can.  Start complaining that Mexican flags are offensive.  Stop being defeatist by saying things such as &#8220;we&rsquo;re finished, we deserve it, there&rsquo;s nothing we can do&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s amazing that people who are ostensibly pro-white are parroting liberal anti-white propaganda.  R.K.S.</p>

		<p>This story was discussed on our local radio talk show this week.  The madness is apparent in asking the following logical question:</p>
<p>(1) Would this woman, had she been living in Mexico for 14 years (or for that matter, even if she was just visiting there), have complained about a Mexican flag being hung in a Mexican office shortly before some national military day of honor?  Of course not.<br>
 <br>
(2) Would she have objected to a Mexican or African or Rainbow flag in the Texan hospital office?  And would the higher-ups have made a person take down one of those flags, if someone else complained?  Highly unlikely. </p>
<p>(3) Why did the higher-ups not tell her to &ldquo;deal with it&rdquo;, rather than pandering to her offended demands?</p>
<p><br>
Unfortunately, the expedient declaration of being offended, coming from anyone but a white male, when directed at a white person, is automatic grounds for punitive action.  This theme underscores much that is wrong in the US today, and will inflict untold harm in coming years.</p>

		<p>If the ex-African woman took down the flag herself and set it on the floor, then didn&rsquo;t she commit some kind of crime?  Aren&rsquo;t there laws about what you can and cannot do to the flag?  Or, with flag burning OK these days in liberal quarters, maybe that&rsquo;s no longer the case.</p>
