<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>HOLLYWOOD star Jamie Foxx is set to play out of his skin  &mdash;  in a shock film role as Frank Sinatra.</p>
<p>Movie bosses want to prove the big screen is colour blind by casting black actor Foxx, 41, as Ol&rsquo; Blue Eyes.</p>
<p>George Clooney, 48, Leonardo DiCaprio, 34, Harry Connick Jnr, 41, and Justin Timberlake, 28, were tipped for the role.</p>
<p>But Foxx has emerged as surprise favourite to play the singing legend  &mdash;  who died 11 years ago aged 82  &mdash;  in the biopic directed by Martin Scorsese, 66.</p>
<p>An industry insider said: &#8220;Jamie would seem to be born to the role.</p>
<p>&#8220;Magnificent voice, convincing acting ability  &mdash;  like Frank himself  &mdash;  born the wrong side of the tracks, makes it big against the odds, has his brushes with authority.</p>
<p>&#8220;The guy&rsquo;s a gift.&#8221; Foxx shot to fame in 1999 in Oliver Stone&rsquo;s Any Given Sunday and won an Oscar for playing Ray Charles in the 2004 film Ray.</p>
<p>He has also had a string of hit music releases, including Gold Digger with Kanye West, 31.</p>
<p>He was adopted as a baby by his grandparents and raised a strict Baptist in a racially-segregated Texan community.</p>
<p>Sinatra, who was raised in New Jersey by Italian immigrants, also shot to fame despite a gritty upbringing during the Great Depression.</p>
<p>The My Way star, who won 11 Grammy awards, also combin-ed a music career with film roles.</p>
<p>For years agents at the FBI kept a 2,500-page dossier on the performer, because of his links to Mafia characters.</p>

<p>https://defamer.gawker.com/5259274/guys-we-were-just-kidding-about-that-jamie-foxx-as-frank-sinatra-thing</p>
<p>It was shown to be a hoax, one group put it up as a joke. The liberals in their drooling multicult lust, ran with it without so much as checking to see if it was valid. The usual suspects even touting how &#8220;colorblind&#8221; the choice made Hollywood. Its all very sick, but for once, its a joke.</p>

<p>Two quick points here:</p>
<p>First, while the Hollywood movie mafia may wish to prove that the big screen is &ldquo;colour blind,&rdquo; I wonder how many Americans of Italian descent will take to the idea? My guess is, not many; or for that matter, most other &ldquo;unpigmented&rdquo; Americans either. Thus, another multicultural Hollywood financial debacle is in the making. </p>
<p>Second, I wonder if one of the scorned Comrades: Clooney, DiCaprio, Connick, or Timberlake, will be cast as &ldquo;Ol&rsquo; Blue Eyes&rsquo;&rdquo; black buddy Sammy Davis Jr. as a consolation prize? After all, just how &ldquo;colour blind&rdquo; is Hollywood?</p>
<p>I bet, they are not that &ldquo;colour blind!&rdquo;<br>

			<p>If Scorcese makes a biopic of Sinatra with the black Jamie Foxx as Sinatra, we will see the birth of a new film genre: &#8220;psychedelic&#8221;. Some part of me actually has hope that, if Scorcese does the brain-dead thing of casting a black as Sinatra, maybe the &#8220;psychedelic&#8221; over-the-top nature of such insanity will rouse large numbers of White folks into defensive action for their kind.

			<p>Remember not long ago the outcry when Robert Downey, Jr. put on blackface for Tropic Thunder? How about in the classroom where only black teachers can teach black students? No whites allowed there! But I guess anyone can play an Italian-American crooner because whites are so used to roll over and play dead when asked. What an insult! Is Scorsese smoking something?</p>

			<p>Movies cost 50 to 80 million dollars to film.  that&rsquo;s amazing that a studio would actually film a movie that no one wants to see, just to prove a point.   Who would watch it?  And it&rsquo;s not like Sinatra-mania is at an all time high anyway.</p>

			<p> They can&rsquo;t be serious!! Can they? Of course they can   &mdash;   this world has gone crazy when it comes to the issue of race. Let&rsquo;s pretend it doesn&rsquo;t exist   &mdash;   until some black claims he&rsquo;s been discriminated against because he&rsquo;s black. Then it exists BIG TIME, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p> So if Jamie Foxx actually, truly, with a straight face, plays the Italian-American and very much Caucasian Sinatra; and the other people in the movie have to pretend, with a straight face, that this black is actually a White guy, are we all supposed to suspend our disbelief like it&rsquo;s never been suspended before and say, &#8220;Hey, looks just like Ole&rsquo; Blue Eyes, don&rsquo;t he?&#8221; Or maybe Foxx will &#8220;white up&#8221; like the two guys in &#8220;White Chicks&#8221; did   &mdash;   only this time we&rsquo;re supposed to just not notice. Or if he doesn&rsquo;t do that, assume he got a deep tan in that desert sun at Palm Springs. Or something.</p>
<p> If they&rsquo;re serious about this, how about them finding a White actor to play Martin Luther King in that worshipful bio that I hear Steven Spielberg is planning?</p>

			<p>This type of movie-making has sadly become typical (and predictable) of Hollywood, which is why I hardly watch movies and tv anymore.  Anyone remember the recently released (and laughable) movie &#8220;Obsessed&#8221;?</p>
<p>I predict Jamie Foxx&rsquo;s movie will be about as popular as Beyonce&rsquo;s, and in the theatres for about as long.</p>
<p>As for Martin Scorsese?  He wins the Stepin Fetchit Award for betraying his own kind in order to curry favor with his masters.</p>

			<p>Makes perfect sense. You see Sinatra is what they call a &#8220;cool guy&#8221;. Back in the day lots of cool guys were white. </p>
<p>Nowadays of course hollywood has shown us the truth  &mdash;  only black guys are cool.  But not to worry  &mdash;  white actors still have plenty of work available playing bumbling oafs, effeminate homosexuals and of course evil racists.  </p>
<p>But you have to admit a caucasian actor playing a masculine, charismatic, man&rsquo;s man in this  day and age would be pretty ridiculous.</p>

<p>Yeah, well, it&rsquo;s kinda like the rumors of cannibalism a few days after Katrina hit New Orleans.  It seemed extremely unlikely, but everyone seemed to consider it completely plausible, including most vocally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Robinson" rel="nofollow">Randall Robinson</a>.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me all that much that Jamie Fox would be picked to portray Sinatra.  Not in the day and age when you see <a href="https://coverawards.com/2009/04/22/news_heidi_klum_usmagazine_baby_cover_31971/" rel="nofollow">this</a> on the magazine rack in the check out line at the grocery store.  Or a Miss America contestant gets into bona fide trouble over a response to a direct question, as Ann Coulter said, an answer wrapped in so many layers of sugar it took 10 minutes to get to the point, that she doesn&rsquo;t approve of same-sex marriage. What is the benchmark for not-preposterous?</p>

<p>For some O.K. recent films check out the remake of &#8216;3.10 to Yuma&rsquo; with Russell Crowe and Christian Bale or &#8216;There will be Blood&rsquo; with Daniel Day Lewis.<br>
Admittedly they are both set pre-1930&rsquo;s, and since those titles were posted a few months ago on another movie related thread, no other &#8216;good ones&rsquo; have come across my radar since.<br>
But at least they have positive depictions of White males. <br>
&#8216;Saving Private Ryan&rsquo;, &#8216;300&rsquo;, &#8216;Master and Commander&rsquo; and the &#8216;Lord of the Rings&rsquo; of course, also come to mind.<br>
I guess you have to wait a while for the good ones.</p>
<p>Another film I caught the other night on cable that I&rsquo;m reluctant to mention as it&rsquo;s a low brow, C-grade science fiction<br>
was &#8216;Starship Troopers 3&rsquo;. Though it was very cheesy, it had a very pro-christian message that I enjoyed.<br>
Of the &#8216;onward Christain soliders&rsquo; tone that you get from V-dare&rsquo;s Chuck Baldwin or from the <a href="https://www.kinism.net/index.php/weblog/beliefs/" rel="nofollow">Kinism</a> movement, as opposed to the modern &#8220;we&rsquo;re making great inroads in Africa and South America&#8221; Christianity.</p>
<p>Hollywood has certainly come out of the closet a lot more these days. Two &#8216;entertainment news&rsquo; stories from the last week.</p>
<p>&#8216;Wanda Sykes&rsquo;s wife gives birth to twins&rsquo; <a href="https://tinyurl.com/qeamfp" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/qeamfp</a><br>
And&hellip;<br>
&#8216;Cynthia Nixon to wed Christine Marinoni&rsquo;<br>
https://tinyurl.com/p8luaa</p>
<p>All this progress in the modern World of &#8220;anything goes&#8221;, &#8220;we&rsquo;re all the same&#8221;,&#8221;do what ever you want, whenever&#8221; and &#8220;we believe in nothing&#8221; as &#8220;nothing matters&#8221;.<br>
Makes me feel like a dinosaur at the age of 36, and makes me wish for some social regression (not oppression). </p>
<p><br>
For some more conservative friendly titles, we can always go back in time.<br>

And even though the breeders may out number us at over 10 to 1 globally, we can still vote with our wallets and support the things we like and boycott those we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Also check out directors like Terry Gilliam, David Cronenberg or Tim Burton also.</p>

He bites the hand that has fed him, and all Whites with a backbone must boycott this ungrateful fraud. He is just another spoiled, overrated a**hole that made it big in an industry created by the very people he loathes.

			<p>Nobody would go to see this movie if Foxx played Sinatra. Of course this has to be a hoax.</p>
<p>Harry Connick gets my vote. He sounds most like Sinatra when he sings. I wonder if he can act. He would probably be good enough with the proper direction.</p>

			<p>Par for the course from Hollywierd, where truth is stranger than fiction. </p>
<p>The new Star Trek movie has just about every ranking officer in Star Fleet portrayed as Hindu or Black. The Star Fleet academy scene has maybe 25-40% black or brown faces, but the admiral is black of course. The joke is that the whole Star Trek is a twisted derivative of 1940&rsquo;s white frontier/adventure stories, a completely white Anglo Saxon genre. The kind of genre that would now be roundly condemned as &#8220;imperialist&#8221; and &#8220;chauvanist&#8221; and everything else. </p>
<p>Roddenberry consciously subverted other people&rsquo;s dreams and coated them with blacks, Russians (that meant Communists back then), feminism, you name it. The new movie even plays up the Wagnerian musical themes that appeal to white men. That kind of music stirs something inside our souls, so Hollywood makes sure to blacken (ruin) the picture. It&rsquo;s a way of thwarting our inner desires and impulses to achieve greatness as a civilization. </p>
<p>Star Trek is the classic example of the future that cannot happen, but it&rsquo;s a dream for some. Use white men as useful idiots who supply unlimited hard work, heroism, ingenuity, reliability, and tax dollars too I&rsquo;m sure, to run a society dominated by blacks and browns and women (the best anti-white weapon ever invented since the Garden of old). </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lie because the more black and brown a society becomes, the less capable and mobilized it can be to achieve real greatness. In reality all those blacks and browns grind the whole society down until nothing is left of value except the useful white idiots who keep the system running and tax funded. </p>
<p>Another over the top Hollywierd flick coming out soon is &#8220;Inglorious Basterdz,&#8221; where Tarantino expects all us useful idiots to get giddy and excited watching brutality against blond Germans. See it for what it is. It&rsquo;s an assault on the senses and the reasonable mind, but more than that it is an assault on the white man&rsquo;s soul. </p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s all remember that Sinatra was key to getting blacks, like Sammy Davis Jr. into all hotel rooms with Whites. Maybe Sinatra should be portrayed as a Black man. He made Whites feel &#8220;ashamed&#8221; for discriminating against blacks, did he not?  Anyway, this story is a farce. I also heard that the Honeymooners will now have an all black cast. Is that true?</p>

			<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me,Hollywood has done this before.I was watching a movie about an x-special forces real time hero.He took a job in Mexico as a guard and driver for a wealthy Mexicans daughter.He later in the movie gave his life to save hers on a prisoner swap.The special forces guy was black,but the name sounded like he was from Eastern Europe.When the movie was over,I googled his name and sure enough,the story was true and he was white.They also made a story of a famous horse,but changed the sex to a philly.I don&rsquo;t watch movies anymore,all the heroes are black and are the head honchos,and the stupid gangsters are all white.Of course real Americans know what is correct,for now anyway.The Liberals will try to ram anything they can down our throat.</p>

			<p>I believed every word in the hoax. We see this sort of &#8220;untraditional casting&#8221; done by the multiculturalists. My personal favorite was back in the early 1990s, the Metropolitan Opera ran a Ring Cycle. In the opera &#8220;Valkerie&#8221;, the Germanic princess Sieglinde was played by Jessye Norman, an African American. Now Norman is not a bad singer (she did a good job on the role), but&hellip; give me a break. Actually Disney is doing more to break the bounds of logic with its inter-racial Pocahontas and now some story about a (what?) New Orleans African American Princess???and a white(sort of ) guy. What is next? But Foxx as Sinatra, I did not give it another thought.</p>

			<p>i like to be careful about believing garbage like this. There was a rumor that eddie murphy was going to play the riddler in the next batman movie. it was on drudge and everything. sure enough it turned out to not be true. I think some blogger is making stuff like this up to rile up racially conscious whites. </p>

			<p>&#8220;I also heard that the Honeymooners will now have an all black cast. Is that true?&#8221;  This sounds a bit suspicious also.  In PC America, Ralph Cramden (sp?), who, if memory serves me correctly, was a bus driver, would have to be recast as the CEO, or some other executive, of the local transit authority.  Hey, I gots it.  He could be the chairman of the transit authority diversity commission.  Having black Ralph as a lowly bus driver would be uh, uh, racist!</p>
<p>If Hollyweird is REALLY going to show its stuff, then I nominate Rosie O&rsquo;Donnel, or Roseanne Barr, to play ML (Michael) King.</p>

			<p>Did anyone see and hear Jamie Foxx on the CMA broadcast a month or so ago? I was sickened by him and by the CMA..What happened to country? Too many tried to dress like Hollywood sluts and allowed this anti-White racist Jamie Foxx to speak?  They are &#8220;proud&#8221; to integrate blacks now into their flock?  Goodbye and good riddance to the NEW country.</p>

			<p>This must indeed be a hoax, but it is a point well made.  After all, in the 1980s, it became very popular to cast blacks in Shakespeare plays in both theater and in film.  (And Othello the Moor was a Moor, not a Sub-Saharan Black).  I heard and read every justification for it imaginable.  But the truth is they wanted to titillate the basest and crash taboos.  Now, in 2009 we have movies like &#8220;Black Snake Moan&#8221; and &#8220;Obsessed&#8221; and every &#8220;reality&#8221; show manages to regularly feature a White woman in some sort of pre-delecto or frank sexual situation with a black.  In a decade or two, after people like my mother who swooned over &#8220;Frankie&#8221; are long gone, a black will likely play him.  He will be the &#8220;Shaft&#8221; of the big band era.</p>
<p>But a lie is a lie, no matter how much you tout it as &#8220;truth.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This report is a hoax,but it could easily have come to pass.<br>
In England there is a concerted campaign to airbrush in anomalous<br>
ethnic characters into &#8220;historical&#8221; dramas,most notably &#8220;The Tudors&#8221;,in which Henry VIII was priviliged to be surrounded by <br>
Black and Pakistani courtiers.Black actors are also routinely<br>
cast in major shakespearian roles such as Hamlet and Richard III<br>
There is nothing to suggest that Hollywood is any more sensible on these matters so we can look forward to any number of cultural abominations in the future. </p>

<p>It might well be a hoax.  But the element of a successful hoax is elements of truth.  It&rsquo;s easy to fall for because it&rsquo;s something H&rsquo;wood would do.</p>

The Honeymooners was made with a black cast in 2005. I don&rsquo;t remember it getting good reviews or making a dent at the box office:</p>

			<p>i apologize for lack of cap&rsquo;s. my keyboard is malfunctioning.</p>
<p>this is vaguely reminiscent of will smith playing james west in &#8216;the wild, wild west&rsquo; where smith played a mid-nineteenth century character opposite - and upstaged a more seasoned actor -kevin kline. i have a problem with that. the movie is set in the mid-1800&rsquo;s&hellip;a time when blacks were either still slaves, scarce as hen&rsquo;s teeth in the west, or newly freed and not recognized as equal citizens with whites in such things as using the same restrooms, let alone riding trains or playing in a superior capacity to a white man, kline. it doesn&rsquo;t smack of the ridiculousness of jamie foxx playing sinatra, but it might as well be as unbelievable given the time era and setting. the movie was aimed at the young, who as we all well know, have been brainwashed into believing race is irrelevant. <br>
it wasn&rsquo;t irrelevant to them when they turned out in droves to vote for obama, where their main reason was to put the first black in the white house, irregardless of his lack of qualifications.</p>

			<p>If this is true, it is stupid.  I predict that should Foxx be chosen to play &#8220;ole blue eyes&#8221;, they better on plan on losing a lot of money.</p>
