<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Racially segregated proms have been held in Montgomery County [Georgia]  &mdash;  where about two-thirds of the population is white  &mdash;  almost every year since its schools were integrated in 1971. {snip} All students are welcome at the black prom, though generally few if any white students show up. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Earlier this month, on the Friday night of the white prom, Kera Nobles, a senior who is black, and six of her black classmates drove over to the local community center where it was being held. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The seven teenagers  &mdash;  a mix of girls and boys  &mdash;  slowly worked their way through two buckets of fried chicken. They cracked jokes about the white people&rsquo;s prom (&#8220;I feel bad for them! Their prom is lame!&#8221;). They puzzled merrily over white girls&rsquo; devotion both to tanning beds (&#8220;You don&rsquo;t like black people, but you&rsquo;re working your hardest to get as brown as I am!&#8221;) and also to the very boys who were excluded from the dance (&#8220;Half of those girls, when they get home, they&rsquo;re gonna text a black boy&#8221;). They mused about whether white parents really believed that by keeping black people out of the prom, it would keep them out of their children&rsquo;s lives (&#8220;You think there aren&rsquo;t going to be black boys at college?&#8221;). {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The next night, {snip} a girl named Angel checked her cellphone to see if any of the white kids had texted from inside their prom. They hadn&rsquo;t. {snip}</p>

Funny how blacks can mock whites with impunity. Blacks should be glad they don&rsquo;t have to mix with those &#8216;lame&rsquo; white folk.</p>
<p>The comments from the black boys seems to be sour grapes. I guess they&rsquo;ll have to wait until college to have free access to the white girls.</p>

			<p>This stuff is so damned tiring. Where is the freedom? Freedom is always held up as one of the highest ideals in life, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t hurt someone, right? Most of these kids, if asked, would probably say they&rsquo;d prefer to be with their own group anyway, because they could act more naturally, have more things in common,etc.etc. It reminds me of how adults are always trying to micro-manage kids. It is somewhat similar.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard this one quite a lot, but - if that&rsquo;s the case - then why are there so many &#8220;bottle blondes&#8221; around?<br/>
Surely, wanting to &#8220;look black&#8221; (sic) via tanning should also extend to dying one&rsquo;s hair black too.</p>

<p>I doubt 50%. Maybe 10-20% will and these will be the bottom feeders. A lot of intelligent White women are liberals,but even they have a &#8220;easy-to control&#8221; white boy not a White man. But if it is 50% then these black girls should be embarresed. Do they think White men will chase them and not the cute Asian girl?<br/>

			<p>Reading the whole article, as I did in it&rsquo;s original form, I came away with the feeling that this is more about jealousy on the part of blacks than anything else.</p>
<p>The blacks are resentful that whites dare to have their own prom and to have their families involved in it. Blacks want to stick their noses into everything that whites do as if they feel it is their right to do so. </p>

			<p>Freedom of Association - horrors. Imagine such a radical concept. And I bet the proms of the Time&rsquo;s writers children, up at private academies in Greenwich and the Hamptons and such, are as Lily-white or more so than the middle class folks in middle Georgia. When the hypocritical limosine liberals integrate, then perhaps they can start lecturing middle America about the virtues of miscegenation.</p>

			<p>Why on earth would self respecting white people want to lose their white Identity?????? Why should this not be the case??? Just as a healthy strong individual preserves his individuality why shouldn&rsquo;t the white race harken unto this same instinct&hellip; even at the dismay of those that want to steal into the white gene pool using every trick in the book  ??!</p>

			<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the New York Times have more important things than some prom down in Georgia? Yes, they have de facto segregated proms because the Blacks want it that way, if they didn&rsquo;t, it wouldn&rsquo;t happen. Whites and Blacks often have different musical and dance tastes and cultural differences and Blacks prefer a prom of their own culture.</p>

			<p>Each year there is a BLACK only Debutant Ball held in Newark New Jersey.  So if BLACKS can hold BLACK ONLY debutant balls, white kids have the right to hold private proms for WHITES ONLY too.  White power is beautiful too.</p>

			<p>Is there any reason to believe that the prom was not labled &#8220;White only&#8221; but two proms were held, one playing country and pop music and the other one playing hip hop? It may have been just a logistical thing. There are so many &#8220;Black Only&#8221; functions, beauty contests, scholarships, country clubs, debutante balls ect. In my hometown of Lake Charles La, there was a traditionally Black and traditionally White country club. Nobody told anyone that they could not join the other and others were common guests but nobody complained except transplanted Yankees. It surely sounded like these girls were harassing the White kids at their prom, if the races had been reversed there would have certainly been a beat down. BTW stay out of the tanning beds, they are horrible for your skin. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Some white students still prefer to have their own prom.&#8221; Well, despite AR&rsquo;s sub-headline, no, they don&rsquo;t, at least according to this NYT Magazine article.  Its author, Sara Corbett, claims  most of the white students and all of the black ones don&rsquo;t want separate proms.  Only some bigoted white parents are driving this whole thing.  And, as the young, probably white, authoress takes care to assert (by quoting the black students), half the white girls are dating black boys.  The white students themselves are quoted saying it&rsquo;s &#8220;only a tradition&#8221; and that except for the prom, they do &#8220;everything&#8221; with blacks. If this is all true, then time will solve this horrible problem of the segregated prom: in another generation many of the white girls will have married their black boyfriends and had mulatto children, who will become the students who will put an end to this racist nonsense once and for all.  Right?</p>
<p>Maybe not.  The article has some problems.  First, it&rsquo;s curiously short for a NYT Magazine piece, and for a topic (the benightedness of the Deep South) so dear to the hearts of the media in general and the NYT in particular.  It&rsquo;s as if large parts of the original version (or, at least, the raw material of the article) didn&rsquo;t fit the PC parameters of Sara and her editors.  Perhaps answers by students of both races that weren&rsquo;t multi-cultural enough.  Perhaps evidence that it&rsquo;s not just those cracker white parents who are responsible for this abomination of a whites only prom. (For, as Sara points out, the black prom is &#8220;open to all.&#8221;) </p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the one-sidedness problem.  Maybe the blacks&rsquo; claim that half the white girls date blacks should have been checked against what the whites themselves might have to say on the subject.  A confirmation would surely have been the big and glorious type of news the NYT would see &#8220;fit to print.&#8221;  And the central mystery of the article, how the white bigot parents are able to ram this horror down the throats of their own children year and year, when no student apparently supports it, should have been explored a little more thoroughly.  You know, Journalism 101.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just it. This isn&rsquo;t journalism, this is objective driven propaganda.  The objective: demoralize whites and destroy the last vestiges of their identity.  </p>
<p>Who knows, beyond the simple fact of its existence, if &#8220;some white students still prefer to have their own prom?&#8221;  You can&rsquo;t form a reasoned opinion from this article, but I&rsquo;m guessing that AR has it right, after all. </p>

			<p>I agree, it&rsquo;s harassment.  Too bad it&rsquo;s legal to harass whites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that the author tries to paint the whites as racists who don&rsquo;t want to mix with the blacks, and of course totally gives the blacks a pass for making racist comments about the whites.  Maybe these anti-white racist attitudes are the reason whites want their own prom?</p>

			<p>Proms are rites of passage into adulthood, and whites should always have their own proms where they can form relationships with whites of the opposite sex and eventually have white children and help with the survival of our people.</p>

<p>Indeed the white girls look like they walked off the set of a TV show  and the black girls look like they are a few buckets extra crispy past what anyone would consider attractive.</p>
<p>The fried chicken connoisseur, Kera Nobles, in particular seems to have had bad luck in love with the men. In her web page Kera  &mdash;   &#8220;Take Da GOOD W/ Da BAD&#8221;  &mdash;  Nobles loudly declares that &#8220;MEN R DAWGS&#8221; and her relationship status listed as &#8220;single&#8221;. I guess she has to blame white girls for stealing all her men rather then her negative attitude and over zealous poultry consumption.</p>
<p>Speaking of white hussies, the irresistible Terra Fountain who is  quoted as the pro miscegenation white girl living with her black lover looks pretty much exactly what you&rsquo;d expect a 18 year old girl cohabitating with a black guy to look like:</p>
<p>http://www.myspace.com/terra008</p>
<p>Showing off way to much skin and flashing a gang sign? What a gal!</p>
<p>Her life motto and nugget of insight to the world is : &#8220;Its getting Better I got everything just how i want it&hellip;.hahaha Maybe it will stay like this for awhile&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly a sensitive and intelligent young woman. I am sure she and her young african life partner are destined for great things in this world. </p>

			<p>What a laugh.   Since the New York Times loves stories on race you wonder when they&rsquo;ll get around to noticing the fact that there are vast and growing areas of New York that are no-go zones for whites.  Shouldn&rsquo;t the taxpayers who pay for those streets be allowed to walk down them without being assaulted and harassed because of their skin color?  Inquiring minds want to know why the Times never addresses the question.    And how many of the reporters and editors of the Times sent their kids to private schools?  Of course, I&rsquo;m not suggesting they sent them there so they wouldn&rsquo;t have to go to school with &#8220;those people&#8221;, oh heavens to Betsy, no!   </p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t feel bad y&rsquo;know, the fact that &#8220;squares&#8221;, &#8220;stiffs&#8221;, or &#8220;whites&#8221; are having a good time on their own without &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; and rubbish behaviour, is giving them the complete SH**S!<br/>
Great! Good to see white boys and girls having a nice time.</p>
<p>As a white male and a nerd (and proud of it, well&hellip;I&rsquo;m using the term in a flippant manner. I&rsquo;m a bit bookish, not the classic nerd. A fun-loving nerd if ye will) I would take that as the highest compliment. That a complete dimwit would go out of their way to call me &#8220;lame&#8221;, would please me greatly!</p>

<p>Also notice how the Blacks wanted to go and bug the White Prom&hellip; This is so typical of blacks who are endlessly fascinated with the White Race, after awhile it gets annoying though (not to mention dangerous given Black rates of Criminality) </p>

			<p>Jared Taylor often points out how kids gravitate towards their own race in school cafeterias. That&rsquo;s what I thought of when I read this article. These black kids, who at certain points in the article seemed to be trying to portray themselves as victims, probably prefer the company of their own kind in mixed race settings. Why, then, would they want an integrated prom? The answer to this question can&rsquo;t be found in the New York Times&hellip;</p>

			<blockquote>&ldquo;All students are welcome at the black prom, though generally few if any white students show up.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>That few whites show up to the black prom is not surprising at all. The reason is because whites and blacks generally have different cultures, which means different taste in music, and also different dancing styles. This is <b>not</b> a bad thing.<br/>
  <br/>
What is surprising is that the school is able to do it without outrage and vilification in the left-wing media. </p>

			<p> Now all we need is for a gay or Latina group of kids to have a prom.  I love it when Libs cant decide who to side with. Its a shame Sara Corbett didnt consider the white kids may just wanted to reduce the chance of being beaten or harrassed</p>

			<p>She would never send her kid to an all-Black prom but she expects the average american to.</p>
<p>I suspect the same could be said of most of our politicians (black or white) including the various &#8220;Board of Education&#8221; members in far to many states/counties and cities. If a board member doesn&rsquo;t have children in the particular system, they should not be on the board.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve heard this one quite a lot, but - if that&rsquo;s the case - then why are there so many &ldquo;bottle blondes&rdquo; around?<br/>
Surely, wanting to &ldquo;look black&rdquo; (sic) via tanning should also extend to dying one&rsquo;s hair black too.<br/>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>Whites getting a suntan does not turn them into Africans.<br/>
There&rsquo;s an enormous difference.</p>

			<p><i>&#8221; Since the New York Times loves stories on race you wonder when they&rsquo;ll get around to noticing the fact that there are vast and growing areas of New York that are no-go zones for whites. &hellip;.Inquiring minds want to know why the Times never addresses the question. And how many of the reporters and editors of the Times send their kids to private schools? &#8220;<br/>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>And when will the NYT do a story on the parts of Manhattan, such as where I live   &mdash;   and where many of their reporters and editors do too   &mdash;    which  are (thankfully) ALL white?   </p>
<p>Oh, you won&rsquo;t see anything about that.  They prefer to go farther afield into someplace like Georgia to find exotic specimens of lily-white racism flaunting its ugly head.  The Southern, Anglo kind is always more newsworthy, I guess.  More reprehensible.   At home, it&rsquo;s slightly embarrassing, but excusable.  After all  (as I&rsquo;ve heard it explained), their children need good educations, and you can&rsquo;t expect them to mix with  &#8220;those people&#8221;.</p>

<p>I sit in the park and observe how the sparrows and pigeons and squirrels all keep pretty much to themselves, going separately about their business.  You toss them some peanuts and they all scramble to grab their share, intermingling for a few seconds, then sort themselves out again and return back to their own kind.  Always to their own.  Sparrows with sparrows, pigeons with pigeons.  It is remarkably peaceful. There is no fighting, no animosity.   Birds do not &#8220;hate&#8221; each other. But they keep to their own kind.  They are segregationists without knowing the word. They are following nature&rsquo;s command.  Why have we gone so far astray?  Why have we forgotten what even the sparrows know?</p>

<p>The answer for this unnatural situation,  though it&rsquo;s deep-rooted  and complex and requires some study, can be found in the Frankfurt School, which has had enormous influence on America.   Its philosophical roots  go back two centuries into the Enlightenment;  and it&rsquo;s disciples can be found staffing the desks of the New York Times today.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s influence on reshaping  the American mind and imposing racial integration has been incalculable,  impossible to exaggerate.  It is perhaps the most successful take-over attempt of all time. They have all but conquered America, ideologically, without firing a shot.  And most Americans have never even heard of them.</p>

			<p>I went into a mostly black club and had to be padded down and saw stuff that not even loser white males would do to women, yet it was just common in this black club.  I left with my liberal white friend and we went to some white clubs where it was much peaceful and I felt safer there.  but, hey &#8220;it&rsquo;s racist&#8221; for me to point that fact out, right?</p>

			<p>The seven teenagers &mdash; a mix of girls and boys &mdash; slowly worked their way through two buckets of fried chicken. They cracked jokes about the white people&rsquo;s prom (&ldquo;I feel bad for them! Their prom is lame!&rdquo;). They puzzled merrily over white girls&rsquo; devotion both to tanning beds (&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like black people, but you&rsquo;re working your hardest to get as brown as I am!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Yet these blacks are the ones who showed up at the whites prom, to do what, cause trouble? They have a inferiority complex when they are excluded by whites and can&rsquo;t leave things well enough alone. The whites have no trouble staying away from the black&rsquo;s prom and not going over there to cause trouble. <br/>
Notice that they couldn&rsquo;t stay away from the fried chicken. That&rsquo;s what the whites have to do next time, is to leave no fried chicken lying around for unwanted blacks to show up. </p>

			<p>Gosh, what White students wouldn&rsquo;t want a bunch of annoying blacks at their prom, helping themselves to two buckets of chicken and making jokes about you at your expense? Can&rsquo;t think of anything better then that. (Sarcasm off).</p>

			<p>Proms are basically coming-of-age ceremonies. So, what would a &#8220;white prom&#8221; be like without any black influences at all? And what would a &#8220;black prom&#8221; be like without any white influences at all?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the second question put another way: What is done in traditional African coming-of-age ceremonies, and why are &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; not engaging in them?<br/>

			<p>As a black high school senior, what&rsquo;s wrong with the idea that whites who prefer all-whites proms, go to all-white proms; blacks who prefer all black proms, go to all-black proms; and those who prefer integrated proms, organize one and go to it instead?</p>
<p>FWIW, being a gym rat (restricted diet), a bookworm (I view an Ivy League education as the passport out of my lower middle class existence) and a poor (cannot afford the prom makeover) I didn&rsquo;t go any senior prom. </p>

			<p>As a southerner who has been around Blacks much of my life, I can tell you for a fact that Blacks very much want to have their own proms, their own culture, their own communities and churches and they do NOT want Whites or others non-Blacks to be a deep part of them. They find it ok associating with Whites and others on a superficial level but not one in which Whites and others ie.Latinos are an integral part of their community. </p>

			<p>&#8220;The photos that accompany the original article are interesting: €the black students all look kinda glum, while the whites are beaming with confident smiles. Maybe they&rsquo;re just hot, but who knows. Pictures often tell a story that the text carefully ignores.&#8221; Posted by JustPlainMean at 9:14 PM on May 26</p>
<p>Your post reminded me of something. I once worked at a place that employed a lot of blacks. I remember one black girl showing me some pictures of her wedding. What struck me was that none of the men were smiling. In the posed pictures most of the women were smiling, but all the men, including the groom, were scowling and even looked menacing.I thought it was very strange and not a little bit scary.  </p>
