<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30732546/">Less Immigration Slows Asian, Hispanic Growth</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, May 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Deterred by immigration laws and the lackluster economy, the population growth of Hispanics and Asians in the U.S. has slowed unexpectedly, causing the government to push back estimates on when minorities will become the majority by as much as a decade.</p>
<p>Census data released Thursday also showed that fewer Hispanics were migrating to suburbs and newly emerging immigrant areas in the Southeast, including Arkansas, Tennessee and Georgia, staying put instead in traditional gateway locations such as California.</p>
<p>The nation&rsquo;s overall minority population continues to rise steadily, adding 2.3 percent in 2008 to 104.6 million, or 34 percent of the total population. But the slowdown among Hispanics and Asians continues to shift conventional notions on when the tipping point in U.S. diversity will come  &mdash;  estimated to occur more than three decades from now. Black growth rates remain somewhat flat.</p>
<p>Thirty-six states had lower Hispanic growth in 2008 compared with the year before. The declines were in places where the housing bubble burst, such as Nevada and Arizona, which lost construction jobs that tend to attract immigrants.</p>
<p><b>Decreases seen in the Southeast</b></p>
<p>Other decreases were seen in new immigrant destinations in the Southeast, previously seen as offering good manufacturing jobs in lower-cost cities compared to the pricier Northeast. In contrast, cities in California, Illinois and New Jersey showed gains.</p>
<p>In Arkansas, manufacturing and poultry companies have cut hours and workers, leaving a growing number of Hispanics unable to cover their mortgage payments, said Maribel Tapia, a housing counselor in Fayetteville, Ark. Fathers are moving out of state, where other relatives have lines on menial jobs that support the families they leave behind, she said. Police in northwest Arkansas created an immigration task force with the help of U.S. immigration agents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The political effects can be high. Minorities turned out in record numbers last November to vote, largely for Democrat Barack Obama, and Hispanic groups are now flexing their growing clout in future elections as they push immigration reform.</p>
<p>More than a dozen states also stand to gain or lose House seats after the 2010 census depending on last-minute shifts in population.</p>
<p><b>People are staying put</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Census Bureau projected last August that white children will become the minority in 2023 and the overall white population will follow in 2042. The agency now says it will recalculate those figures, typically updated every three to four years, because they don&rsquo;t fully take into account anti-immigration policies after the September 2001 terror attacks and the current economic crisis.</p>
<p>The new projections, expected to be released later this year, could delay the tipping point for minorities by 10 years, given the current low rates of immigration, David Waddington, the Census Bureau&rsquo;s chief of projections, said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the latest data, the percentage growth of Hispanics slowed from 4.0 percent in 2001 to 3.2 percent last year; their slowed population growth would have been greater if it weren&rsquo;t for their high fertility  &mdash;  nearly 10 births for every death.</p>
<p><b>Fastest-growing minority groups</b></p>
<p>Asians also slowed their population increases from 3.7 percent in 2001 to about 2.5 percent. Hispanics and Asians still are the two fastest-growing minority groups, making up about 15 percent and 4.4 percent of the U.S. population, respectively.</p>
<p>Blacks, who compose about 12.2 percent of the population, have increased at a rate of about 1 percent each year. Whites, with a median age of 41, have increased very little in recent years due to low birth rates and an aging boomer population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Six U.S. counties saw their minority populations become the majority, including Orange County, Fla., the nation&rsquo;s 35th most populous county that is home to Orlando. Webster County in Georgia was majority-minority in 2007 but reverted back to white majority in 2008.</p>
<p>In all, about 309 of the nation&rsquo;s 3,142 counties, or one in 10, have minority populations greater than 50 percent. Other counties that become majority-minority in 2008 were Stanislaus in California; Finney in Kansas; Warren in Mississippi; and Edwards and Schleicher counties in Texas.</p>
<p><b>Top 10 in Texas</b></p>
<p>Other findings:</p>
<p>    * There are 48 majority Hispanic counties nationally; the top 10 were all in Texas. The gateway cities of Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Houston and Chicago had the greatest number of Hispanics.</p>
<p>    * Seventy-seven counties are majority-black; all were in the South. Atlanta edged past Chicago in the number of blacks, ranking second after New York City. They were followed by Washington and Philadelphia.</p>
<p>    * Honolulu County, Hawaii, was the only majority Asian county in the nation. New York City had the highest population of Asians, surpassing Los Angeles. Asians also numbered the most in San Francisco; San Jose, Calif.; and Chicago.</p>
<p>    * California, the nation&rsquo;s most populous state, also had the most number of whites. Maine and Vermont had the highest share of whites at 95 percent each.</p>
<p>In Nashville, Tenn., Maria Lopez, a 49-year-old Mexican immigrant, said business is down 80 percent at the restaurant she runs, and 10 to 15 people come in a day asking for jobs, mostly Hispanics.</p>
<p>Lopez said she had to cut back on the amount of money she was sending back home to her family in Mexico. Although she&rsquo;s been in the U.S. for 13 years, she is thinking about returning to Mexico.</p>

		<p>This refutes the conventional wisdom that the takeover of the US by minorities is &#8220;inevitable.&#8221;  </p>
<p>If a bad economy and Bush&rsquo;s half-hearted attempts to enforce immigration laws can have such a big impact, imagine what would happen if we truly rolled up our sleeves, closed the border, declared a moratorium on all non-essential legal immigration, and cracked down on those employing &amp; sheltering illegal aliens!</p>

		<p>This minority-majority propaganda is just psychological warfare against whites to convince them to give up against the &#8216;inevitable.&rsquo; Yes, the &#8216;inevitability&rsquo; factor in Marxist theories crop up again here. This article states flat out the last projection didn&rsquo;t take into account post-9/11 immigration policies or the currecnt recession. </p>
<p>The current projections also do not take into account ANY events that could transpire in the next 30 years. Such events could include: further terrorist attacks that unite patriotic Americans, immigrants being lured away by China or India, ethnic conflict within the United States, a tax revolt by whites, the U.S. military revolting against the rest of government, etc. Non-white immigration will stop when the freebies come to an end. And that will be long before they gain majority status.</p>
<p>One thing I think is certain; non-whites WILL NEVER takeover a functioning, first world United States. If they do become a majority, it will be in a country that is in ruins to which whites will have no loyalty. Whites will fight again when all pretense of legitimacy in government disappears. </p>

		<p>The &#8220;government&#8221; pushed back about a decade when minorities would become majorities?</p>
<p>Well, why didn&rsquo;t they factor in this possibility when they projected their demographs originally?  I mean, if they&rsquo;re going to issue demographic stats 40 years into the future, can&rsquo;t they at least factor in variables and report them at the same time they gleefully release their projections when whites will be a minority?</p>
<p>Too, why is it we never get any projections on other things?  Is it because a portion of the government that releases these figures are part of a cabal of mentally disturbed ideologues who want to see a conglomeration of different races, because it satisfies some sick obsession they have that has to do with multiculturalism?  (Over the objection of a majority of the people in this country too, incidentally, including many non-whites.)</p>
<p>Well, I think considerable pressure needs to be brought to bear on these federal demographers to include numerous foot notes and disclaimers regarding their figures to better inform all of us.  For example, there&rsquo;s a very good chance Mexico will fall to the drug lords, and the US will be involved in a war with Mexico. Will that be a plus or minus regarding mestizos?</p>
<p>Too, there&rsquo;s even a greater chance that we will literally collapse economically and states will either secede from the union or racial/political civil war will occur.</p>
<p>And, there are other VERY real possibilities that can occur which will effect the racial make-up of the population 40 years from now, one of which could be food and water wars, severe drought and the like.</p>
<p>The one certain way for these reports to stop coming out by the feds is if they see an unavoidable situation coming which will cause a sharp reduction in mestizos and a rise to 76% by the white population, with the promise of slight future increases.<br>
Not one word will be printed about what kind of racial makeup we will likely see in 40 years.</p>

<p>Good, but we need whites to wake up and halt further legal 3rd world immigration, demand enforcement of our employment laws to send the illegal packing, get rid of the h1b visa programs and get our country back. It&rsquo;s not too late.</p>

<p>What an odd turn of phrase, &ldquo;the tipping point in U.S. diversity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why not the &ldquo;enrichment point,&rdquo; or better still, the &ldquo;utopia point,&rdquo; of U.S. diversity?</p>
<p>How is it that the &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; future of a nonwhite majority USA, has such a strange angst about its &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo; establishment, that can make even some unnamed &ldquo;reporters&rdquo; at the dogmatically multicultural AP engage in such a journalistic faux pas? I mean, it is not as if some army of space aliens or zombies is about to dominate our country, it is only undocumented migrants and H1-B tech-virtuosos who will bring about this, &ldquo;tipping point in U.S. diversity,&rdquo; right?</p>
<p>Or did I miss something?</p>

<p>This article is misleading.  Many of us know that there are alot of groups encompassing the Census Bureau&rsquo;s non-hispanic White category that are not European in origin.  European-Americans are 60% of the population and will be a minority in the next 20 years, not by 2042.   </p>

<p>You mean they only wanted the money? You mean their immigration is only about economics? But it doesn&rsquo;t matter! Because only an American wants to make money! Why greed is a staple of the American character, unique amongst all the peoples of the world!</p>

		<p>The economic situation of the US will unfortunately continue to deteriorate due to too many asians, hispanics and blacks. It is the Whites who built America and made it great, if immigration and  multi-culturalism were good for the US, the US would be booming. America will eventually need to bring in tougher immigration laws as the country slids deeper into debt and chaos. </p>
<p>&#8220;The whites makes it and the asian, hispanic and black men destroy it, rob it, cheat it and third world it&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Ranger raises the the issue of the interaction of post-1965 immigration policy and ecology. It is a mighty serious issue that is hardly ever discussed. Those of you who think you can run off to a &#8220;your own private Idaho&#8221; somewhere in America-as Chronicles writer Sean Scallon does-are completely delusional. Allow the post-1965 non-white population to exponentially explode and they will destroy the life sustaining ecocosystems write up to the border of your &#8220;own private Idaho&#8221; somewhere in Wisconsin. These White private Idahos are not long term viable&hellip;.especially if you let China and India&rsquo;s borders extend deep into the American Heartland.</p>
<p>Whe we speak to or fellow Native Born White Americans about post-1965 immigration policy we need to combine both the race-replacement issue with the ecology-issue. It will grab White people more powerfully in the gut. The two issues really are inseparable. Ask our fellow White Americans how many amenities they are willing togive uo to accomdate a rapidly growing asian and muslim population. Amenities such as the bucolic country drive on a Sunday afternoon, weekend getaways to the Adirondacks. The waiting list to get into Yellowstone during the summer time is alreay quite long. </p>
<p>I beleive it is quite possible to repell the invasion and restore White Americans to 90 percent of the American population&hellip;as soon as a critical numeber of White Americans get over the denial phase..the revolt will be total.</p>

		<p>Is there any organization or group that is asking for the repeal of the law on automatic citizenship for any baby whose mother can step over the border and give birth moments later? If so, I&rsquo;d like to know and add my voice. I think this would be the biggest deterrent to illegal immigration. That first, then E-Verify mandated for all businesses, and a crackdown of benefits.<br>
We are known around the world as the biggest patsy of all. If you can get to the US, you&rsquo;ve got it made from birth to death. This is because it is so profitable to our elected representatives, greedy businesses and anti-American groups. Let&rsquo;s stand up for ourselves for a change. I just read an article this morning about the &#8221; US Hispanic C or C.&#8221; Are caucasians allowed? Can you hear the uproar of the regular C of C changed to &#8220;The Caucasian Chamber of Commerce.&#8221; That&rsquo;s just one small way in which we have bowed to a onslaught of poor, uneducated criminals and their supporters. Mr. President, you are fond of saying, &#8220;we can do anything.&#8221; Prove it. Rid the country of illegal aliens and put a moratorium on all immigration until we straighten out this mess our leaders have caused.</p>

		<p>For those who may be wondering about the author of this article, her name is Hope Yen (sounds Chinese). <br>
   I love how she says that &#8220;Minorities turned out in record numbers last November to vote, largely for Democrat Barack Obama.&#8221; This is what the left wants, more minorities -especially hispanics- who will be unable to provide for themselves and their families w/o government assistance in the form of things like foodstamps, WIC, substidized housing and head start. More money from the pockets of white taxpayers who are forced to substidize their own displacement by third-worlders. California is broke in no small part because incompetent tax-consumers are causing competent tax-payers to flee the state. An immigration slowdown maybe be good, but only an end to this horrendous immigration onslaught would warrant poping open the champagne and celebrating.  </p>

<p>It makes sense to those of us that are really White or should I say Europid?  </p>
<p>From the Census Bureau:<br>
White. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as &#8220;White&#8221; or report entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish.</p>

		<p>I read on another blog today that the governor of California was disturbed by the drop in taxes being collected. Maybe he should figure out how to collect it from all those illegals California was and is so eager to have? This is what happens when you force hardworking producers to leave your state and replace them with two or three non tax paying illegals for each of the productive individuals who left, Illegals who drain the system, not add to it? The next move will be to ask all other states to chip in to pay for California&rsquo;s Foolish Decisions?</p>

		<p>The main problem is our corrupt congress and our president both the Left and the Right. The Left worships multiculturalism and left leaning congress members want the mexican vote, the Right is in with big business who wants the cheap mexican labor. Together both Left and Right are in bed. Special interest groups and lobbyists run this country, not the people. Frankly, in my opinion, most of congress needs to be kicked out, lobbying where money is given needs to be done away with and we need term limits. Since immigration is so important, we need a national referendum on the issue after everyone is given ALL of the facts and costs, with crime etc.</p>

It includes people who indicate their race as &ldquo;White&rdquo; or report entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;..you are really mixed up anonymous. </p>
<p>If you knew anything about history and culture you would realise that white people came from the middle east. We had to wait until 5,000 years ago for the ice sheets to melt in Europe so colonisation and immigration were possible. White people ruled the Eurasian Steppe from North-West China all the way to the Atlantic, to be white you need to have Indo-European genetics which are found in many ancient civilisation in Europe, the Middles East and Asia becuase the whites were and are the torch bearers of culture. Many cultures and people have come and gone; the Tocharian Celts ruled the Tarim Basin in China and took civilisation to China when the Han Chinese were still hanging out in rice paddies. The Normans invaded England, Malta, Sicily, parts of coastal Italy and Lebanon and left their genetics in the local populations. This explains the Indo-European DNA in the arab gene pool. Don&rsquo;t forget that other Indo-European tribes; the Hittites, Philistines, Alans, Scythians, Ionians, Romans, Sarmatians also left their intelligence amongst the barbaric tribes of North Africa and Asia. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The next move will be to ask all other states to chip in to pay for California&rsquo;s Foolish Decisions?&#8221;</p>
<p>This has already happened. California wants a 6 billion dollar bailout from the federal governement. I don&rsquo;t think this should be allowed. California should have to live with its&rsquo; policies and the same goes for any other state. No federal bailouts.<br>

<p>80-90% of European DNA is from people who weathered the last ice age in Europe. They were already living in Europe 20 thousand years ago. They drove the Neanderthals to extinction. The other 10-20% is from Near Easterners who moved into Europe and brought agriculture with them.</p>

<p>I have to correct you Alan, the Neanderthals did not mix with the new Caucausian emigrants. The Neanderthals died out with climate change. Where did you get your incorrect information from, on the back of a Kellogg&rsquo;s packet?</p>
<p>There has been over 5,000 years of constant immigration into Europe. The Caucasian people colonised North Africa, Europe, the Middle East and the Eurasian Steppe but fortified their position in Europe to become the dominant peoples. </p>

<p>Anonymous&rsquo; opinion is shared by the vast majority of us Whites.  Arabs and other Middle Easterners are not White. In fact, the evidence is beyond questioning that the largest of the non-European caucasian groups in this country are responsible for the predicament we&rsquo;re in at this moment.    </p>

<p>Calling Middle Easterners &#8220;white&#8221; might be a problem in Europe (with France&rsquo;s Algerian problem and Germany&rsquo;s Turk/Kurd problem), but the reason they haven&rsquo;t been carved off from the white population (like Hispanics have been) is because there aren&rsquo;t enough of them here to make the Census do so (as with the Hispanics). Back in 1970s, Mexicans were &#8220;white&#8221;. I&rsquo;d imagine if we did get a flood of Muslim Middle Easterners, they&rsquo;d be carved off too into a separate &#8220;Muslim&#8221; category like the Hispanics have been.</p>
<p>And besides&hellip; most Middle Easterners in the United States right now are Christian Arabs from Lebanon and the rest of the Levant, and I&rsquo;d call them &#8220;white&#8221; and in the same general category as Greeks, Sicilians, Armenians   &mdash;   and Maltese, which are an entire country of partly Italianized Christian Arabs. The Iranians here are generally secular, Bahai, or Jewish. Most Muslims here are black or South Asian   &mdash;   Pakistanis are counted as Asian, by the way.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This article is misleading. Many of us know that there are alot of groups encompassing the Census Bureau&rsquo;s non-hispanic White category that are not European in origin. European-Americans are 60% of the population and will be a minority in the next 20 years, not by 2042. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to know that some people on here are aware of the true nature of our demographic plight despite government attempts at blurring the truth with phony census numbers.  Here&rsquo;s some food for thought.  Are they also counting Arabs and that which must not be named when calculating that only 53% of children are White?  I believe the answer is yes and that non-Hispanic White children are already a minority.  However, there are significant numbers of actual White hispanics in this country so whether White children are a minority or not depends on the birth rates of European descended Spaniards in this country. I believe White children still have a slim majority. </p>

<p>This is why White Nationalism is based on genetics not skin color.  If it were not, you could contort the definition of White to include half the world&rsquo;s population including Indians, Turks, Iraqis and even Japanese, Chinese and Korean.  I have no problem with Christianized Arabs and there were many that went through Ellis Island and have established a history in this country but most Middle Easterners in the world are not Christian.  At least a third in this country are muslims and at least 6 million are &#8220;something else&#8221;.  </p>

<p>It is suppose to have to do with the ruling elites wanting an unlimited supply of cheap labor so they can line their pocketbooks with more money. It also may have to do with them consolidating their power over more ignorant masses, which the 3rd world hordes represent. Unless something is done to change this trend, whites will become a minority in their own country and the 3rd world hordes will eventually take over. A bleak depressing prospect at best. </p>
