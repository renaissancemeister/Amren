<h1>Five Phila. Officers Fired, Three Over Slurs</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Moran, Philadelphia Inquirer, April 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Five Philadelphia police officers were fired yesterday for alleged misconduct, including two incidents in which officers were accused of using racial slurs.</p>
<p>Among them was William Thrasher, 24, who allegedly called African Americans in his 22d District &#8220;animals&#8221; and worse.</p>
<p>Thrasher, who had been on the force for two years, was quoted by a Temple University journalism student who was riding with him on patrol for a class assignment.</p>
<p>Shannon McDonald&rsquo;s article was posted on a Temple Web site. Philadelphia media picked up the quotes, which prompted demands for Thrasher&rsquo;s firing.</p>
<p>Officers Donald Swan and Anthony Ferriola were also dismissed on allegations that they used racial epithets on the job. The remarks allegedly were made toward students while the two responded to a fight March 13 inside Audenried High School in South Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The remaining two officers, John Safarowicz and Sgt. Paul Seeger, were terminated for alleged conduct in separate off-duty incidents. They also were criminally charged yesterday.</p>
<p>All five officers were officially suspended 30 days with intent to dismiss. The firings were announced in a news release. Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>John McNesby, president of Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 5, said the union would file grievances on behalf of the officers and then review the internal investigations that had been conducted for each of them.</p>
<p>As for the alleged racial slurs, McNesby said the police union did not condone such behavior but questioned whether discipline short of firing was more appropriate.</p>
<p>During the ride-along, Thrasher allegedly referred to the violence in his predominantly African American district as &#8220;typical n- s-&#8221; or &#8220;TNS.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chris Harper, the associate journalism professor at Temple who edited McDonald&rsquo;s article, said the commissioner&rsquo;s action vindicated the accuracy of McDonald&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>McDonald, a 21-year-old senior who is about to graduate, went on a three-hour ride with Thrasher on Jan. 30 for Temple&rsquo;s Multimedia Urban Reporting Lab, which is the final required course for a journalism major.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The article is still online at www.temple.edu/murl</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>James Golden, chief safety executive for the Philadelphia School District, said: &#8220;We are grateful for [Ramsey&rsquo;s] swift and direct action in this case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Golden said a large fight in Audenried&rsquo;s cafeteria had required a response from school and city police. During the response, students complained, and teachers and other staff allegedly heard Swan and Ferriola utter racial epithets at students.</p>
<p>Swan was a four-year veteran. Ferriola joined the department three years ago.</p>

<p>Ok.  Next time the honor students of this fine institute of learning decide to riot, make Mr. Golden and the ever-offended staff break it up.  <br>

			<p>You want LEOs to tell the truth.  And for the most part, they did tell the truth here.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this deflates the Mumia cause.  Philadelphia has always been a weird kind of city compared to the Germanic &#8220;Pennsylvania Dutch&#8221; country.  Even in the colonial era, Philadelphia maintained a snooty, holier than thou, Quaker/egalitarian pseudo-enlightenment attitude, spearheaded by Ben Franklin&rsquo;s hatred toward the Germans in his own state.  The Germans therefore had no use for Philadelphia.  Even today, the Philadelphia civic elite are the ideological (and sometimes literal) ancestors of that mentality.  Which is why I could never buy the &#8220;racist cops&#8221; contention of the Mumiabots.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m in the camp of those who think the firings were excessive.  Officer William Thrasher was very stupid and obviously trying to impress the college student who probably led him down that primrose path.  However, am I the only one who thinks PC is out of control, expecially with any mention concerning blacks. This is especially true when the mayor and police chief are both black.  Maybe the student is also black, who knows.  However, this could be an indelible teaching lesson for the young cop along with a suspension without pay.  The result would most likely result in a good cop.  I don&rsquo;t know about Philly but Los Angeles and Las Vegas are constantly trying to recruit police officers.  The competion is so strong that Los Angeles County constantly runs ads in Las Vegas to attract potential sheriff deputies. This young cop has learned a good lesson and is probably salvageable. Maybe, just maybe, the Philly Dept. may be just a little over sensitive.  </p>

<p>Well, seems to me like he&rsquo;s calling it how he sees it.  I understand that cops are quite knowledgeable about how most blacks tend to behave.  They have to deal with it on a daily basis.</p>

			<p>  Sorry, but if this spreads I would venture to say that 85% of all Whites would be have to be fired for this kind of thinking, the other 15% should be fired for lying.</p>

			<p>I knew that cop would get fired for calling blacks &#8220;animals&#8221;. I hope that the journalism student is happy. The next time she is harrased by a black man I wonder if she will call the cops? Would should they come to her aid?</p>

			<p>Yup- I knew this would end like this.</p>
<p>Spilling your guts to a female journaslism major from the northeast was career suicide.  </p>
<p>And she knew this would get hm fired. I know the type: She probably just sat there showing no indication she was offended. You know, smiling, asking questions and making small talk. Then she thanks him at the conclusion of the tour and proceeds to ruin his career. </p>
<p>In addition to majoring in journalism, toss in a few women&rsquo;s studies courses for good measure and stick-it to the white male.</p>

			<p>When I was on the job, I had a hard and fast rule: No reporters in my car. Period. If I had been ordered to take a reporter as a ride along, I was fully prepared to go the whole shift without saying a word. I would have gotten disciplined, but at least I wouldn&rsquo;t have been misquoted.</p>
<p>The way these things work, Officer Thrasher will probably get his job back after a few months, because management personnel almost always break their own rules (and the law) when firing someone. Then hopefully he will return to work, sadder but wiser. </p>

			<p>Reading the full article I can see some comments best left unsaid, but at the same time it echos what I have heard from police of all races.  Increased police presence is at the request of the law abiding residents, so the answer to what pushes what should be obvious.  No crime = no need for police.  The criminals are animals in that they will kill each other for a little bit of food or whatever, just as animals do.  This officer called a spade a spade and he is losing his career over it.  When will the silent majority actually figure out what is going on and do something? I&rsquo;ll answer, when they are effected themselves.  The masses are sheep, so spread this to everyone you know.</p>

			<p>Well, there&rsquo;s five other people and their families on our side.<br>
The pc crowd have no idea of the damage they do their own cause. It&rsquo;s good to have enemies like this.</p>
<p>I do realize how dangerous and vile they are, but in the long run, they hurt their own ideas more than they hurt us. We shall overcome these people in the end. Have no fear about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not insensitive to the plight of the police officers, but they&rsquo;ll be fine. They&rsquo;ll just get other jobs and move on from here. White people are exceptionally resilient.</p>

			<p>Apparently that &#8220;if the shoe fits, wear it&#8221; adage is still taboo in Philly. Never mind that even when I lived there, Officer Trasher&rsquo;s comments would have been spot-on.</p>
<p>I used to be a daily rider on the Market-Frankford El, and the view from 18 feet or so above street level would be one of destruction, vandalism and mindless grafitti. I would not be politically incorrect enough to name the racial group responsible. But will give at least this much of a hint: &#8220;It was not Philly&rsquo;s White citizens.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Shannon McDonald, the 21 year-old journalism student who sniched on officer Thraser really has no idea how frustrating it must be to be a ploiceman in large and &#8216;diverse&rsquo; city like Philly. Frustrating because a dispropotionate number of blacks engage in uncivil and anti-social behaviors that would rile anyone who has to put up with it day-in and day-out. While its best not to use derogatory names for poeple, just maybe if ms. McDonald was in law enforcement in a city like Philly, she too would be tempted to blurt out unkind words every now and then.  </p>

			<p>didnt his mother ever teach him not to tattletale, yet these same journalist give a blind eye to liberal shannanies.  how critical are we of our beloved president and his goons? </p>
<p><br>
Theodore Roosevelt had a great quote of the critic that sums it up.</p>
<p><br>
Man in the arena</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat.&#8221;  -TR</p>

<p>LAPD advertises so much because it is absolutely committed to hiring only non White minorities.  With the 4ft 10 in non White females being unable to pass the physical and the male minorities being unable to read at 2nd grade level and with felony convictions, LAPD has a difficult time getting enough candidates who are <br>
(1) physically fit (<br>
(2) able to read at 5th grade level and compose a sentence that will not provoke a laughing fit when read out loud by a defense attorney <br>
(3) Possessed of only &#8220;minor&#8221; felony records instead of lengthy serious felony records.</p>
<p>Then too, LAPD prides itself on having the smallest police force for any large city in the country, less than 10,000 officers for more than 4 million people spread over 465 sq miles.</p>
<p>White men have absolutely no chance of getting a job with LAPD.  Their preferred hispanic and blacks who can pass the felony checks are so few that LAPD has to advertise in Vegas.</p>

<p>I work with a White man who is one of the very few Whites in my government agency.  Needless to say, we are in our early 60&rsquo;s and were hired right out of college just a few years before the No Whites Need Apply Laws came into effect.</p>
<p>He says not one word when he is at work, not one word 40 hours a week.  By keeping his mouth totally shut, he has managed to avoid the accusations so often made by the black affirmative action things with whom we work.</p>
<p>Over the years, he has been the subject of many false accusations by the black women.  He managed to fight off the HR nazis and preserve his job.</p>
<p>I agree, it is best not to say a word to any minority or liberal because they will lie, cheat and do anything to destroy a White.</p>

			<p>I wonder if he really said what she accused him of?  Over the years I was often accused by White &#8220;community activists&#8221; and their black followers of saying insensitive things.</p>
<p>I always managed to refrut them, but it was often difficult, especially as my liberal County Supervisors were determined to purge the ranks of County employees of Whites.</p>

			<p>Assuming the officers fired were not as diverse as the population at large, or the ranks of the police&hellip;doesn&rsquo;t that make this policy &#8220;racist&#8221; under the &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; rule?  Oh wait, that only goes one way.  Which is why all these &#8220;laws&#8221; fall under the aegis of &#8220;equal protection&#8221; then?</p>

			<p>When are we whites going to realize en masse that we have to stop trying to fit into a diverse society?  We need to form our own society right here in the U.S. and right where each of us lives.</p>
<p>It starts with us asserting our right to be as we are and as we want to be and to associate with anyone want to associate with or not associate with.  And, it continues when we get over this aracial nonsense that so many of us think we must champion.</p>
<p>We are white people.  That&rsquo;s the way God (or nature)made us. We are fine just as we are.  We have our own genetic ways and we don&rsquo;t have to bend to others.</p>
