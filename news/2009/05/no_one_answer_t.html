<h1>No One Answer to Disparity in Black, White Infant Mortality Rates</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ashley Kelly, Daily Press (Newport News,  Virginia), May 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The gap between black and white infant mortality continues across the country  &mdash;  and in Hampton Roads it continues to be much larger than it is nationally.</p>
<p>Despite advances in medicine, no one answer definitively explains the disparity.</p>
<p>Black women in Virginia are 2.5 times more likely to experience infant mortality than women of other races, according to the state Department of Health.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Jerome Strauss, dean of medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University, has conducted research that found a connection between the environment and a genetic variation that causes the fetal membrane to rupture leading to pre-term births in black women.</p>
<p>The research revealed a genetic variant that appears to have arisen in Africa which triples the likelihood of the fetal membrane breaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s a significant risk increase. That&rsquo;s not going to explain all pre-term births that occur in African Americans, but it&rsquo;s going to be a factor that&rsquo;s responsible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nationally, infant mortality among blacks in 2000 occurred at a rate of 14.1 deaths per 1,000 live births, according to the Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities. This is more than twice the national average of 6.9 deaths per 1,000 live births.</p>
<p>Thursa D. Crittenden, of the Virginia Department of Health office of minority health and public health policy, points to chronic stress which predisposes theblack woman to poor health.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While this is the case, infant mortality does not occur only in those neighborhoods, she [Beth Kavinsky, coordinator of the Eastern Virginia Perinatal Council] said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have an African-American woman that makes $150,000 a year as a lawyer, and her rate does not decrease significantly just because she has a better lifestyle.&#8221;</p>

			<p><i>The research revealed a genetic variant that appears to have arisen in Africa which triples the likelihood of the fetal membrane breaking.</i></p>
<p>Could this be a consequence of Prof. Rushton&rsquo;s application of the r-K life history spectrum to race?</p>

			<p>Beating your babies to death has a lot to do with it.  So does the presence of so many psychotic, sadistic boyfriends who are not the Fathers of the babies in the home.</p>
<p>National Review has published many articles re the fact that step fathers and Mom&rsquo;s boyfriends are the main danger to children.</p>

<p>Where have they found one of these?</p>

			<p>&ldquo;You can have an African-American woman that makes $150,000 a year as a lawyer, and her rate does not decrease significantly just because she has a better lifestyle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since when is the high stress life of an attorney that makes this much considered better?  The error is that more money does not necessarily produce or prove a better &#8220;lifestyle.&#8221;  And I wonder if they looked at the diets of affluent Black women as well?  A monkey could construct a better set of statisticts.</p>

			<p>Why don&rsquo;t they compare some other group to blacks instead of Whites? What is the black / Asian comparison here? Why are Whites always the benchmark against which blacks (a failed and pathological race) are measured against?</p>
