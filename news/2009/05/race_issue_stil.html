<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/may/13/race-south-africa-black-players-de-villiers">Race Issue Still a Problem in South African Rugby, Insists Springboks Coach</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Guardian (Manchester), May 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The South Africa rugby union coach Peter de Villiers feels that the country&rsquo;s black rugby players are still not being given the chances they deserve and that the national team&rsquo;s development is being hampered as a result.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are still too many coaches that are not prepared to give black players a fair opportunity,&#8221; De Villiers said. &#8220;As with black coaches, black rugby players have to work 10 times as hard before they are given a chance to show what they are worth.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Villiers, who is currently preparing for the imminent British and Irish Lions tour, insists talent, irrespective of skin colour, deserves recognition.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my job to identify talent and to believe in it,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Players must have enough faith in their abilities and not be afraid to express themselves on a rugby field.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a coach is one-dimensional in his thinking, he will never be successful.&#8221;<br>

<i>&#8220;&hellip;black rugby players have to work 10 times as hard before they are given a chance to show what they are worth.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The canard heard &#8216;round the world.</p>
<p>It would appear that even if blacks have to work 10 time harder at anything, they still fall short when compared to whites. If they want to be equal, maybe they should shoot for 11 times harder.</p>

<p>How can anyone seriously claim that this is the case?  South African rugby is infected with the same stringent racial preference policies as the rest of the country.  DeVilliers is singing the same old &#8220;tale of woe&#8221; we hear every day, ad nauseum.</p>

			<p>lets cut to the chase and say what this is really all about. De Villiers is the national rugby coach. and he&rsquo;s probably been told that if he doesn&rsquo;t towe the ANC line that they can replace him with someone who will.</p>

			<p>Yes,<br>
What people dont understand is us whites in SA only form +- 8% to 9% of the population, so you have an affirmative action program against the minority in favour of 92% of population. Black peolpe mostly like soccer, whites mostly rugby. If they want to play rugby, fine! But why force the team to become 92% black????? I have stoped watching rugby and now play &#8220;juksky&#8221; on Saterdays. In other words, stoped watching multiCult sport and now practice a traditional white Afrikaner sport.  </p>

			<p>Sort of like how the All-white high school football teams that destroy the all black high school football teams are not given a chance under America&rsquo;s caste sorting system. There was a white kid in California (I forget his name) a few years ago that was the captain of a all white high school team. They destroyed a all black team in the California State championship while preserving their undefeated record. From the team 0 white boys were given a scholarship to a Division 1 univdersity for football. 0. Let me say that again. 0.<br>
From the black team that was beaten  the number of full ride scholarships was in the double digits. That is about as in your face as it gets when it comes to discrimination.</p>

			<p>Racist black South Africans should stop complaining about the &#8220;injustices&#8221; done by &#8220;whitey&#8221;; there won&rsquo;t be any whites in South Africa in a few decades from now if the anti-white genocide and white exodus don&rsquo;t reverse.</p>

			<p>How do you prove blacks have had to work 10 times harder than whites?  How do they know whites don&rsquo;t have their own personal and family issues that they to suck up while they go about their daily lives?  How can these blacks that say that just be so arrogant and full of pride about it? </p>

			<p>Is this perhaps what he has to do to get a promotion,  or maybe even to maintain his present position?  Does he have to show that he&rsquo;s more politically correct than anyone else?</p>
<p>Oh, but Fred already answered me above.  Yep, I guessed it!</p>

			<p> They need not worry, they&rsquo;ll probably end up in England where the RFU are deliberately &#8216;diversifying&rsquo;the national side with any number<br>
of mediocre black players,the vast majority of whom were not even born here. </p>

			<p>I remember when I was in high school, whenever our predominantly white football team ( I was not on the team) would beat an all-black football squad, there would always be fights between the students of both schools. At first, I thought it was because of taunting, but then I realized that blacks had an inferiority complex, and hated to be shown up in any way, by a superior squad, ESPECIALLY one that was predominantly Caucasian.. </p>
<p>In my first year in high school, my brother and a couple of his friends were heading home after our school whipped an all-black school in the city playoffs (by 20-6). He and his friends were set upon by a pack of blacks from the rival school. They fought with the blacks before the police broke it up. The blacks were arrested, and my brother and his friends had to go to court to testify against them.</p>
<p>By the way, our school beat two other all-black schools in football that year, by a 12-0 score in one game, and 68-0 in the other. In both those instances, there were post-game fights.</p>
<p>Blacks just can&rsquo;t lose with any semblance of grace or dignity.  </p>
