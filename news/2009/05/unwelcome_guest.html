<h1><a href="https://www.thestar.com/comment/article/640224">Unwelcome Guest Workers</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gillian Steward, Toronto Star, May 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In Alberta&rsquo;s tight job market the rumour persists: some employers are hiring temporary foreign workers while shutting out Canadian applicants. &#8220;I usually work in landscaping during the summer, but my boss is bringing in Mexicans, so I am out of luck this year,&#8221; a Calgary woman told me last week.</p>
<p>For Yessy Byl, an Edmonton labour lawyer, the situation has gone far beyond the rumour stage. In a recently released report prepared for the Alberta Federation of Labour, she points out that the flow of imported workers continues unabated in the retail, food and hospitality sectors. Byl has also received reports that some employers are laying off permanent residents but retaining temporary workers because they don&rsquo;t have to pay them as much in wages and benefits.</p>
<p>Temporary workers, most of them from the Philippines, Mexico, India and China have been pouring into Alberta for several years. According to Citizenship and Immigration Canada, there were 57,843 temporary foreign workers in Alberta by the end of 2008, a 55 per cent jump from 2007 and more than four times the number residing here five years ago. By contrast, permanent immigration has been relatively stagnant, with fewer than 25,000 immigrants coming to Alberta last year from outside the country, only a few thousand people higher than in 2004.</p>
<p>Alberta is not the only the province to import workers. In raw numbers, Ontario has the highest number at 91,733. B.C. has about the same number as Alberta. Quebec has many fewer at only 26,085.</p>
<p>But relative to the population, Alberta has more foreign workers than any other province. When the program was focused on high-skilled occupations, the bulk of workers came from the U.S., Japan, Britain and Australia. Now most are low-skilled and find themselves working in restaurants, hotels, gas stations and cleaning operations.</p>
<p>Once the workers arrive, most become isolated in a subculture that affords them very little connection with the rest of society. For almost two years now, Byl has been listening to their stories in her office at the Edmonton Community Legal Clinic. But she fears that what she hears is really only the tip of the iceberg because most temporary workers don&rsquo;t speak English well, are afraid to speak out, or don&rsquo;t know who to contact.</p>
<p>What the workers tell her raises serious questions about how they are being treated. They don&rsquo;t seem to be covered by the same employment and safety standards as other Canadians. Their housing and health care are often substandard. Employer contracts are routinely broken, leaving workers adrift.</p>
<p>Many workers are willing to put up with these travails because they are told that they have a good chance of becoming Canadian citizens. But in reality, statistics show that in Alberta only 4 per cent are invited to stay.</p>
<p>Now they face another problem, an ugly backlash from people who believe &#8220;foreigners&#8221; are stealing jobs. I&rsquo;ve certainly heard many of those sorts of comments lately and the people making them don&rsquo;t seem to distinguish between temporary workers and recent immigrants.</p>
<p>Byl believes that the provincial and federal governments urgently need to revamp immigration policy. &#8220;If we need more unskilled workers we should encourage them to immigrate. Otherwise we are going to create an underclass of guest workers, just as they have in Europe .&Nbsp;.&nbsp;. this is not what we want to do in Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither do we want the racial tensions, scapegoating and riots that have erupted in Europe. But that&rsquo;s likely what we will get if governments and employers persist in creating a two-tier labour market.<br>

<p>A &#8220;two-tier labour market&#8221; had already been implemented the same day that government sanctioned employment-equity (affirmative-action) policies came into force. </p>
<p>Unlike the United States with its large Black minority, Canada had no need to implement such race-based policies based on preferential treatment for visible-minorities &hellip;.until we began <i>importing</i> vast numbers of NON-white people!</p>
<p>Our draconian <i>hate laws</i> were designed to mitigate probable hostilities arising from Canadian White males who may have the temerity to object to their job displacements and also their rightfully earned promotions being given to less qualified racial minorities. </p>

<p>The main problem is greedy White people who don&rsquo;t care about their country or culture, just making a few extra bucks. These employers make more money by getting these migrants while the rest of society is left picking up the bill. The problem is the employers as well as politicians, mostly white, who want cheap labor and see potential votes.<br>

		<p>The &#8220;ugly backlash&#8221; isn&rsquo;t coming from people who believe foreigners are stealing jobs. It&rsquo;s only common sense to restrict immigration during a recession. The ugly backlash is coming from the authorities who persist with an unreasonable policy.</p>

<p>Very funny. Canada has not had the will for thirty years to send any illegal over-stayers packing. Only four percent may be invited, but the other ninety-six percent can stay anyway.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really sad to see the citizens lose work &amp; wages to foreigners.  The &#8220;temporary&#8221; workers will most likely become &#8220;permanent&#8221; replacing the Canadians.</p>
<p>What are the Canadians supposed to do for food, money, bills for themselves and their families&hellip;.<br>

<p>This statement is so utterly ridiculous.  Aside from maybe some in the business elite, I don&rsquo;t ever recall hearing the average Canadian tell Americans to welcome hordes of Mexicans and others.  How you even came to this conclusion is beyond me. Canadians aren&rsquo;t some collective like the borg that think and act all the same.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also interesting that you never fail in the opportunity to wallow in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude" rel="nofollow"><b>Schadenfrede</b></a>. </p>
<p>You appear to take delight in rubbing our collective national noses in the landscape, as you have on several other occasions beforehand. The first time is acceptable, but when repeated ad nauseam, it becomes an obsession.</p>

		<p>The problem is the same as it was in the U.S.  Greedy, cheapskate employers hire illegals who lean on the taxpayer for supplemental support, (health care, food, education) while that employer gets away paying the sub-standard worker a substandard wage.  There is only one winner - the employer.  </p>
<p>Would any regular posters on Amren agree that this is capitalism and regulation gone wrong?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a Canadian, and while the average Canadian identifies with the average American on these race and immigration issues, definitely we have a regime and elite that think Canada is superior and more progressive than America on these issues. </p>

===========================================<br>
anting and raging against companies will never change one iota that Companies are in the business of making profits. Period.</p>
<p>The real problem is with the government that gave the companies such incentives as a large pool of illegal labour. And the real problem with the government is that the vote has become a universal franchise so Beavises and Buttheads have the same power at the poll as the most eminent and learned people in society.</p>
<p>So in the end, it comes back to what no one wants to talk about, people are unequal&hellip;even whites. And if you treat them as equal in spite of this (like giving everyone the same voting power regardless aka democracy), the politicians respond to that to get elected and society becomes a mess. </p>

<p>&#8220;Foreigners&#8221;?  Why the quotes?  They are not Canadians, are they?  So they are indeed foreigners, and not &#8220;foreigners&#8221;.  And they ARE taking jobs which would otherwise be held by Canadian citizens.</p>

		<p>An effective solution to this problem might be more workplace shootings.  A bunch of dead corporate big-shots might convince the rest to shape up, and even if they didn&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;d still probably be ahead.</p>

		<p>From experience, I&rsquo;ve found that &#8220;temporary foreign workers&#8221; almost never return to their homeland. It&rsquo;s like here in the USA with Mexicans. They stay, have kids, put down roots and when their numbers get large enough, start making all kinds of demands for change and accomodation in the host country.</p>

<p>&gt; The likely answer is that the journalist is injecting personal opinion, which would make him a &#8220;yellow journalist.&#8221;  The personal opinion is likely that he doesn&rsquo;t believe that anyone can be a &#8220;foreigner&#8221; or an &#8220;alien.&#8221;  That is, until they come to their own nation of birth.  Then, they are &#8220;Gringos,&#8221; &#8220;Whites,&#8221; &#8220;Imperialists,&#8221; etc.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Worker shortages&#8221; </p>
<p>This is Economics 101.  The value of anything is in the scarcity.  There is no job which will remain undone if someone is willing to pay enough.  When there are no takers for a job, raise the wages.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, people did their own gardening and brought a thermos of coffee to work, because it wasn&rsquo;t economical to hire a landscaper of buy from a coffee shop.  Now it&rsquo;s considered a &#8216;worker shortage crisis&rsquo; if there aren&rsquo;t enough migrants around willing to work for slave pay.  </p>
