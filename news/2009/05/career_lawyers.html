			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Seper, Washington Times, May 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Justice Department political appointees overruled career lawyers and ended a civil complaint accusing three members of the New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense of wielding a nightstick and intimidating voters at a Philadelphia polling place last Election Day, according to documents and interviews.</p>
<p>The incident  &mdash;  which gained national attention when it was captured on videotape and distributed on YouTube  &mdash;  had prompted the government to sue the men, saying they violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act by scaring would-be voters with the weapon, racial slurs and military-style uniforms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The career Justice lawyers were on the verge of securing sanctions against the men earlier this month when their superiors ordered them to reverse course, according to interviews and documents. The court had already entered a default judgment against the men on April 20.</p>
<p>A Justice Department spokesman on Thursday confirmed that the agency had dropped the case, dismissing two of the men from the lawsuit with no penalty and winning an order against the third man that simply prohibits him from bringing a weapon to a polling place in future elections.</p>
<p>The department was &#8220;successful in obtaining an injunction that prohibits the defendant who brandished a weapon outside a Philadelphia polling place from doing so again,&#8221; spokesman Alejandro Miyar said. &#8220;Claims were dismissed against the other defendants based on a careful assessment of the facts and the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Court records reviewed by The Times show that career Justice lawyers were seeking a default judgment and penalties against the three men as recently as May 5, before abruptly ending their pursuit 10 days later.</p>
<p>People directly familiar with the case, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because of fear of retribution, said career lawyers in two separate Justice offices had recommended proceeding to default judgment before political superiors overruled them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Justice officials declined to say whether [Attorney General Eric] Holder or other senior Justice officials became involved in the case, saying they don&rsquo;t discuss internal deliberations.</p>
<p>The civil suit filed Jan. 7 identified the three men as members of the Panthers and said they wore military-style uniforms, black berets, combat boots, battle-dress pants, black jackets with military-style insignias and were armed with &#8220;a dangerous weapon&#8221;and used racial slurs and insults to scare would-be voters and those there to assist them at the Philadelphia polling location on Nov. 4.</p>
<p>The complaint said the three men engaged in &#8220;coercion, threats and intimidation, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. racial threats and insults, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. menacing and intimidating gestures, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and movements directed at individuals who were present to vote.&#8221; It said that unless prohibited by court sanctions, they would &#8220;continued to violate .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Voting Rights Act by continuing to direct intimidation, threats and coercion at voters and potential voters, by again deploying uniformed and armed members at the entrance to polling locations in future elections, both in Philadelphia and throughout the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>To support its evidence, the government had secured an affidavit from Bartle Bull, a longtime civil rights activist and former aide to Sen. Robert F. Kennedy&rsquo;s 1968 presidential campaign. Mr. Bull said in a sworn statement dated April 7 that he was serving in November as a credentialed poll watcher in Philadelphia when he saw the three uniformed Panthers confront and intimidate voters with a nightstick.</p>
<p>Inexplicably, the government did not enter the affidavit in the court case, according to the files.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my opinion, the men created an intimidating presence at the entrance to a poll,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;In all my experience in politics, in civil rights litigation and in my efforts in the 1960s to secure the right to vote in Mississippi .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have never encountered or heard of another instance in the United States where armed and uniformed men blocked the entrance to a polling location.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Bull said the &#8220;clear purpose&#8221; of what the Panthers were doing was to &#8220;intimidate voters with whom they did not agree.&#8221; He also said he overheard one of the men tell a white poll watcher: &#8220;You are about to be ruled by the black man, cracker.&#8221;</p>
<p>He called their conduct an &#8220;outrageous affront to American democracy and the rights of voters to participate in an election without fear.&#8221; He said it was a &#8220;racially motivated effort to limit both poll watchers aiding voters, as well as voters with whom the men did not agree.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three men named in the complaint  &mdash;  New Black Panther Chairman Malik Zulu Shabazz, Minister King Samir Shabazz and Jerry Jackson  &mdash;  refused to appear in court to answer the accusations over a near-five month period, court records said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Court records show that as late as May 5, the Justice Department was still considering an order by U.S. District Judge Stewart Dalzell in Philadelphia to seek judgments, or sanctions, against the three Panthers because of their failure to appear.</p>
<p>But 10 days later, the department reversed itself and filed a notice of voluntary dismissal from the complaint for Malik Zulu Shabazz and Mr. Jackson.</p>
<p>That same day, the department asked for the default judgment against King Samir Shabazz, but limited the penalty to an order that he not display a &#8220;weapon within 100 feet of any open polling location on any election day in the city of Philadelphia&#8221; until Nov. 15, 2012.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Efforts to reach the Panthers were unsuccessful. A telephone number listed on the New Black Panthers Web site had been disconnected.</p>
<p>The complaint said that the three men were deployed at the entrance to a Philadelphia polling location wearing the uniform of the New Black Panther Party and that King Samir Shabazz repeatedly brandished a police-style nightstick with a contoured grip and wrist lanyard.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Malik Zulu Shabazz, a Howard University Law School graduate, said the placement of King Samir Shabazz and Mr. Jackson in Philadelphia was part of a nationwide effort to deploy New Black Panther Party members at polling locations on Election Day.</p>

		<p>This is unfortunate as far as it goes, but why were there only civil lawsuits bought by the DOJ at first?  Where was the criminal prosecution?  Do you think there would or wouldn&rsquo;t be if the NBPP were white and in Mississippi trolling a black county&rsquo;s polling places?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been a police officer for several years now, and having watched the included video clip, I&rsquo;ve determined that the only thing missing is&hellip;the cops! </p>
<p>For crying out loud! Citizens will call us over parking complaints, barking dogs, kids playing basketball, loud music&hellip;an endless stream of annoying but nonetheless non-emergency matters. </p>
<p>But three black thugs, up to no good, one of whom is armed with a stick? Are you serious? Blocking the entrance to a public facility, impeding the free flow of pedestrian traffic, disorderly conduct, trespassing, depending on what they said and how they said it, maybe even simple assault (especially considering possession of the stick). </p>
<p>Why weren&rsquo;t the local police all over that? Why weren&rsquo;t the citizens flooding the 911 lines? Why why why?</p>
<p>Cops like me come to work hoping for events like this! I don&rsquo;t expect the average citizen to confront malicious, racist, worthless thugs like this&hellip;but let the scrawny one with the stick take a swing at a uniformed officer! </p>
<p>I can only tell my fellow AmRen readers&hellip;use your local cops! Not all of us are worthless affirmative action hires.</p>

		<p>As Obama said, &#8220;you ain&rsquo;t seen nothing yet&hellip;&#8221;  In a way this is good.  Let the government openly declare its position on free elections by tacitly legitimizing black criminal thuggery.  Better to air this out quickly, just so we know where everyone stands.  </p>

		<p>Welcome to Zimbabwe!!!!!!!! Interesting how Mr.Panther is upset about being filmed and acts like his rights are being violated by the person recording him.If the philadelphia police were thumping a black drug dealer or murder suspect while Mr Panther was around I think He would have his cell phone or camera recording at the speed light.</p>

		<p>This black administration knows it can get away with this, because they rightly perceive whites as too cowardly to confront these kinds of assaults and racial slurs.</p>
<p>If whites fought back at this polling place or at least challenged these illegal actions, certainly this black criminality would never have been ignored.</p>
<p>Fighting back tells the black administration that if they don&rsquo;t enforce the law, whites will do whatever is necessary to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Whites are sheepishly being led to the slaughter house without any attempt to stop their cruel shepards from butchering them.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson and his brothers in arms would be ashamed of us.</p>

		<p>Dismissed or not, in 20 years textbooks are going to be recording this as an intrusive government plot to break up the Panthers. Maybe even connected to anti-Obama sentiment/an anti-Obama plot.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s still democracy, looks like. It is edging closer to Africa where there is almost never democracy. Was reading about a small African country on Wikipedia. The country was proud to boast they were the first country in Africa where an elected head of state stepped down to be replaced by another elected official. It was some time during the late 80&rsquo;s to mid 90&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>Department of Justice has taken the &ldquo;unprecedented&rdquo; step of dropping a case which they had already won by default judgment. Political appointees at Justice pressured career prosecutors into giving up on the case of voter intimidation by the New Black Panthers group in Philadelphia, who attempted to frighten voters away from the polls in the presidential election:<br/>
This certainly does not bode well. No crime is committed by those that support BHO, as long they don&rsquo;t bring a weapon to the polling places. Just another reminder of who won and is in charge, and who is on the list of extremist enemies of the state and who is not. Maybe those secrative talks with Chavez were more about how to remain in power than about state matters. In that case it would not make sense to decriminalize voter intimindation at the polls.<br/>

		<p>I&rsquo;m no fan of the Black Panthers, I quite dislike them actually, but it should be noted that this group is NOT associated in any way with the original Black Panther group. They just stole the name, which the members of the original (but defunct) Black Panthers are not at all happy about partly because of this group&rsquo;s black-supremacist ideology.</p>

		<p>Lets say they tried to intimidate the wrong white man and a knock-down, drag out fight ensued&hellip;</p>
<p>The white man would be the one arrested and criminally prosecuted,(or should I say persecuted)?</p>
<p> Then,some white liberal trial lawyer would sue him civilly if he had money through &#8220;discovery of assets&#8221;,- cha-ching!</p>
<p>Whats the choice? Fight with minority thugs and then be prosecuted by a white liberal system &#8220;hell bent&#8221; on minority appeasement completely out of fear of violence, protests, boycotts,etc. </p>

<p>NOT entirely correct. If you, or anyone, think the &#8220;original&#8221; black panthers were not a militant, racist group of murderous, robbing, raping thugs, you live in LaLa land. I knew many of them in the early 70s L.A. in and out of jail and they ALL were EXACTLY as I just spelled out.</p>

		<p>SKIP:</p>
<p>In Juan Williams book Eyes on the Prize he discusses the fact that the Black panhers of the 60s attempted to include poor Whites and Hispanics in their movement as well. </p>
<p>They saw capitalism as the major enemy. They saw the Vietnam War as one where poor White boys in Appalachia were dying alongside of poor non-White boys while rich boys wer able to secure deferments. This is why a number of them had such a disdain for upscale Blacks as well as upscale Whites. </p>
<p>There are a number of other history books that discuss this as well. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what is going on here. There has to be a story-behind-the-story that will come out at a later date as to why this clearly winnable case was abruptly terminated before it could come to trial.</p>
<p>My first thought is that the political appointee lawyers for the Justice Department did not want to make martyrs of these thugs and give them more attention than they deserved. By going to trial, it might have re-stimulated these thugs to become more militant, thereby attracting a lot of sympathetic press attention. </p>
<p>The press would, no doubt, have trumpeted how &#8220;oppressed&#8221; these poor &#8220;Black Panthers&#8221; were and stated how we all need to just give them more love. My sense (based on nothing concrete, I admit) is that these men may have backed really backed down from their militant position in the presence of attorneys for the U.S. government, and the government attorneys felt that that was enough.</p>
<p>Of course, try being a white Christian who home-schools the children. You can guarantee you will be harassed by the government because they know such people are too civilized to fight back. Our government is afraid of these uneducated &#8220;Black Panther&#8221; thugs and dismissed their case.</p>

		<p>Just because Juan Williams writes something, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s true. Read &#8220;Read Radical Son&#8221; by David Horowitz. Although Horowitz is a neocon shill, his stories about the black panther &#8220;party&#8221; put the lie to the claims of the panther&rsquo;s wanting to join with whites among other PC lies now tossed our way because the Marxists are in complete control. The &#8220;law&#8221; let these panther goons off because no one was &#8220;hurt&#8221;, as in physically hurt. No doubt authorities figure it can be swept under the table and they can then continue their battle against the average white person in the US. </p>

Posted by Quiet Professional at 5:54 PM on May 29 </p>
<p>They should have phoned 911 immediately, and I think there&rsquo;s something more to this as to why somebody did not.  But, more importantly, there was adequate evidence available, including witnesses that would have enabled a prosecutor to bring charges of physical intimidation and intimidating as a hate crime, because it was only whites they were trying to scare off.  </p>
<p>I suspect there&rsquo;s more to that also, and I further suspect it has to do in some way with the influence of Holder&rsquo;s office.  The incident was outrageous and should have been the topic of conversation on every talk radio show in the country, as well as Fox News and Glenn Beck.  (It was given a slight mention in both places, however.)</p>
<p>&#8220;I can only tell my fellow AmRen readers…use your local cops! Not all of us are worthless affirmative action hires.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re right.  The majority of bad cops are in political circles worried about saying the wrong thing that will doom their careers.  After Ruby Ridge and Waco in the mid 90&rsquo;s I knew several Deputy sheriffs who were absolutely outraged over the injustices that occurred, and more than a few were the most vocal activists, declaring (anonomously on talk radio) that they wouldn&rsquo;t stand by while innocent civilians were killed if they were a part of similar situations.</p>
<p>If these Black Panther incidents keep occurring, however, I doubt the police will need to be called, because the whites will have their uniformed militias as before, and the intimidation and threats by ANY black group will be challenged.</p>

<p>Anyway, the night the Phillies won the 2008 World Series I bought a copy of The Philadelphia Daily News (a low brow tabloid if ever there was one) outside Citizen&rsquo;s Bank Park.  On page two was a picture of his royal highness and an article about the New Black Panther Party.  Inside was a vitriolic diatribe against the White race.

		<p>The Bible reads one part, &#8220;By their fruits, ye shall know them.&#8221;  I am of a similar mind when it comes to cities:  By their civic elites, ye shall know them.</p>
<p>That several black military-implied thugs can intimidate white voters in a city like Philadelphia does not surprise me.  Philadelphia&rsquo;s civic elite is, and has been for a long time, Quaker and universalist, and ever so opposed to &#8220;racism&#8221; (i.e. on the part of whites), drawing on the same enmity that Philadephia&rsquo;s original Quaker, Ben Franklin, had toward German immigrants in his state.  This is why I don&rsquo;t buy Mumia&rsquo;s arguments.</p>
<p>Neither Mumia&rsquo;s arguments nor this act of polling place proto-terrorism would have taken place in a half-and-half county in Mississippi.  </p>
