<h1>The Real Pandemic in America Is Hate Crimes Targeting Blacks</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Ward, Imagine 2050, May 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Much has happened since federal hate crime legislation passed out of the U.S House of Representatives two weeks ago. Last week similar legislation, the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, was introduced on the floor of the U.S. Senate. The bi-partisan legislation, named after hate crime victim Matthew Shepard, would allow the U.S. government to prosecute hate crime violence within areas of federal jurisdiction.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since 1995, when hate crime statistics were first collected at the national level, one thing remains clear. Blacks are more likely to be victims of hate crime than any other identity group in the United States.</p>
<p>In the last decade alone nearly 40,000 hate crimes against Blacks have been recorded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That&rsquo;s over 3,000 incidents targeting blacks per year. While the reporting of hate crimes over all continues to decline, hate crimes against blacks have remained fairly consistent (hate crimes against Latinos are on the rise).</p>
<p>While 40,000 incidents in a decade should be alarming news, the actual fact is that that number is closer to 600,000 (that&rsquo;s nearly 45,000 per year). Why? Because hate crimes are notoriously undercounted in the United States. A study done in 2005 by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that hate crimes were actually 15 times higher than reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Marcie Morin in a Sunday guest column for the Denver Post wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;In my mind, I can&rsquo;t reconcile locking people up not just for what they did but for what they were thinking when they did it, and I can&rsquo;t help but feel that it sets a dangerous precedent.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her column, Morin ignores the fact that hate crimes laws, including proposed federal legislation, do not criminalize free speech. Instead they criminalize the action that is motivated by bias, not the bias isolated from the crime. It is no different than enhancing the penalty for a murder that was pre-meditated (i.e. thought out in advance). Simply put, the intent of the perpetrator enhances the crime. Hate crimes should not be judged any differently.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Will federal hate crimes legislation stop all hate crimes? Probably not. But nor do laws criminalizing white collar crimes stop all white collar criminals. The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act is an inclusive law that sends a loud message that it is unacceptable to victimize someone because of who they are perceived to be. Hate crime convictions bring justice which helps the healing process for the survivors of the crime, including the community to which the victim belonged.</p>
<p>Opposition to current hate crime legislation is really a debate about who is an American and more importantly who we believe is not. Hate crimes seek to divide communities based on race, religion, sexual orientations, ethnicity and nationality and is a direct assault on the concept of being an American  &mdash;  &#8220;out of many one.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve always said that if, say, a guy named Bob murders a guy named Charlie it&rsquo;s pretty much a foregone conclusion that Bob hated Charlie.  So classifying it as a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; seems to my mind to be an absurd redundancy.</p>
<p>And on another note.  The phrase &#8220;out of many, one&#8221; has been co opted by the leftist/multi cultural-for-lunch-bunch. It oriinally meant out of many colonies, one nation.  It had nothing whatsoever to do with race or culture.)</p>

			<p>Perhaps blacks are on the receiving end of 3000 racially-motivated incidents a year, but if true, it raises two questions:</p>
<p>1.  How many of these reported incidents are genuine crimes and not &#8220;he looked at me funny&#8221;?</p>
<p>2.  How many of the perpetrators were Hispanics and not whites?  We&rsquo;ve all read about how poorly they get along with blacks.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act is an inclusive law that sends a loud message that it is unacceptable to victimize someone because of who they are perceived to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is the real story about Matthew Shepard.  His killers, like he, were all gay. it was not a romantic triangle or any gay issue.</p>
<p>Matthew was a gay and a retail drug dealer on his college campus.  His killers were gay wholesale drug dealers.  They were involved in the meth trade, both manufacturing it and selling it.  Matthew owed his killers money.  They gave him drugs to sell and he did not pay for the drugs.</p>
<p>The gay issue rose when the killer who actually beat him to death decided to plead self defense against sexual assault on Matthew&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>The media ran with the Matthew was gay story, ignoring the fact that his killer and the accomplices were also gay.</p>
<p>The anti White old and new commies used this killing to ram through a federal hate crime law.  </p>
<p>Had Matthew not been killed, the anti White ADL, AJC, SPLC Tim Wise types would have found another case with which to ram through their hate crime legislation:</p>
<p>Which is aimed at the extermination of most Whites so that a few Whites may rule over a &#8220;boarding house of squabbling nationalities&#8221; </p>

			<p>Those statistics are rediculous. The media keeps repeating the Duke Rape Case and James Byrd because they have no where else to go. If there had been 40,000 reported hate crimes in the US they would have been reported ad nausium. The true hate crimes occur on buses and in parking lots where blacks assault whites and rape women. </p>
<p>They are documented by cameras. </p>

			<p>Does anyone have any actual examples of what is being considered a&#8221;hate crime&#8221;? Does this include incidents of someone saying a racial slur as a punch is being thrown during a mutual fight or is it the &#8220;perception of the victim&#8221; that s/he was attacked because s/he was black or another minority? This number does not ring true. </p>

<i>&#8220;&hellip;nearly 40,000 hate crimes against Blacks have been recorded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Besides not counting hate crimes by blacks against whites, no mention is given to how many of these hate crime reports turn out to be hoaxes or fantasies. Little mention of actual physical violence since most &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo; are little more than graffiti tagging or using a forbidden word during a fight.</p>
<p><i>The American Psychological Association says of hate crimes &ldquo;&hellip; not only is it an attack on one&rsquo;s physical self, but it is also an attack on one&rsquo;s very identity.&rdquo; This is what makes these types of crime so uniquely dangerous. The whole group becomes a victim of the crime.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>SOCIETY itself is guilty and we&rsquo;re all now left to prove we&rsquo;re innocent.</p>

			<p>Add me to the list of those who think hate crimes laws are ridiculous. It is already illegal to murder, assault, etc. To make it an additional crime depending on what you are thinking while commiting a crime is insanity. Especially considering hate crimes laws are not equally applied. I still wouldnt like these laws, but I would be far more receptive to them if they were applied equally across the board.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since 1995, when hate crime statistics were first collected at the national level, one thing remains clear. Blacks are more likely to be victims of hate crime than any other identity group in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Of course blacks are more likely to be the victim of a hate crime. That is because MOST hate crimes commited against whites are not prosecuted nor counted as a hate crime. All here at AMREN are well aware of countless examples where a minority commited a crime against a white, specifically because he was white, and yet no hate crimes charges are forthcoming. A gang of blacks, for example, can target a white, beat him senseless and call him all kinds of vile racist names. And the common response from police is that &#8220;there is no evidence indicating that this crime was motivated by hate&#8221;. </p>
<p>Just what does a black or other minority have to do to a white to be charged with a hate crime? And who is behind this bigotry, giving the police and prosecutors their marching orders to NOT file hate crimes charges when a minority targets a white for a violent crime?</p>

			<p>Its telling that 40,000 supposed hate crimes   &mdash;   over a decade   &mdash;   against blacks by people of any race can be considered a &#8220;Pandemic&#8221;, whilst 40,000 rapes of white women every year by blacks is simply forgotten. </p>
<p>It also shows the conscience of American liberal society&hellip; Black people are the ultimate victims, white people are expendable. Including those white women who often constitute a majority of their constituency. I wonder how long it will take before white women understand that their forced separation from white men by feminism, voiding the usual protector role white men would play has left them terribly exposed in society.</p>

			<p>If the number of &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; against blacks should alarm so shouldn&rsquo;t the 37,000 white women that get raped by blacks every year be cause for alarm, as well?</p>

			<p>When the FBI REFUSES to admit that whites are victimized by blacks, in far greater numbers than attacks on blacks, then it is impossible for the reported numbers to be anything other than black victimhood. The refusal to admit to black attacks on whites as hate crimes, makes a sham out of hate crime laws.</p>
<p>Even if hate crimes were honestly reported, whenever they occur, there is still a fundamental problem with the concept. Why would anyone victimize a person that they LIKE? For many classes of crimes, would it make sense that the victim would be someone disliked by the attacker?<br>

			<p>If you want to curb interracial crimes just up the penalty whenever a criminal crosses racial lines to victimize someone then we would easilyy see who the true perpetrators of hate crimes are.</p>
<p>How exactly can you prove if a black man for example, targets a white woman due to her race for rape? How exactly do you prove if a mugger targeted his victims for muggings by race? Since when is mindreading accepted science? Plus there is no hate crime that was not already considered a crime to begin with. These laws make no sense at all and should be ruled unconstitutional. <br>

			<p>&ldquo;While 40,000 incidents in a decade should be alarming news, the actual fact is that that number is closer to 600,000 (that&rsquo;s nearly 45,000 per year). Why? Because hate crimes are notoriously undercounted in the United States. A study done in 2005 by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that hate crimes were actually 15 times higher than reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well Comrade Ward, let us for the sake of argument agree that indeed there are nearly 45,000 &ldquo;hate crimes&rdquo; targeting blacks per year. My reaction and response to that is, so what and who cares! Every year there are about 35,000 to 40,000 black on white rapes alone in this country, as reported by FBI statistics, and my guess is that this excludes interracial rapes in prisons (which are highly under-reported.) Thus, using your rather fuzzy mathematics we might assume that the number is closer to about 55,000 to 75,0000 per year or greater. </p>
<p>Now we need to consider the fact that so-called &ldquo;hate crimes,&rdquo; can be a very nebulous category of criminal activity; they range from &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo; acts (such as the use of racial slurs or the displaying of particular symbols) to actual acts of violence. Moreover, they assume to decipher motive and specifically single out only one race as the possible perpetrators of them, whites.  From here, we will not even get into the issue of how those specific circumstances perpetuate &ldquo;hate&rdquo; hoaxes in any number of ways, ranging from attempts at monetary and political gains to advantages in criminal cases by nonwhites. </p>
<p>In short, &ldquo;hate crimes laws&rdquo; are nothing more than affirmative action in the criminal justice system, that seeks to advantage nonwhites over whites within that structure. It seems to want to &ldquo;equalize&rdquo; whites to the same level of interracial criminality in this country by way of Marxist fantasy, that comes so naturally to nonwhites in harsh reality.</p>
<p>What more to say, other than God help us all!</p>

			<p>As the saying goes, figures don&rsquo;t lie, but liars can figure. An instance of &#8220;racist graffiti&#8221; (played to full effect in the full-text article) is a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; (and probably a hoax); that little incident in Knoxville and the Wichita massacre are not hate crimes. That tells you all you need to know about &#8220;hate crime&#8221; legislation and the noxious leftists who write and promote it. I think it was Sam Francis who said that the goal of hate crime legislation is to turn criminal courts into political guerrila theater, where ever nook and cranny of the defendant&rsquo;s mind is probed for unacceptable, illegal thoughts. He was right, as usual.</p>

			<p>What planet is this writer living on? It&rsquo;s common knowledge in my part of the country that any time a group of young blacks are congregated together in a public place, they&rsquo;re going to hassle any lone white person who doesn&rsquo;t have enough sense to go someplace else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been mock-assaulted any number of times at the taco shop down the street, that charming African-American custom where one of them stands directly behind you and waves his arms around your head, hoping you&rsquo;ll respond so a dozen of them can jump you. The other day a black female was standing at the counter there, blathering and babbling on her cell phone, refusing to get out of the way so people could order and just HOPING someone would shove her aside so her homies could jump in.</p>
<p>Blacks have one thing and one thing on their mind 24/7: Whitey, how much they hate him, and how much they&rsquo;d love to have an opportunity to start an altercation with him. But it&rsquo;s not a hate crime when blacks do it&hellip;</p>

			<p>from the Bureau of Justice Statistics:</p>
<p>94% of blacks are murdered by other blacks.<br>
86% of whites are murdered by other whites.<br>
85% of interracial crimes involve black perpetrators and white victims.</p>
<p>this indicates that not only are the vast majority of crimes INTRAracial as opposed to INTERracial, but even when crimes are INTERracial that whites are victims 85% of the time. and yet that chucklehead says, &#8220;The Real Pandemic in America Is Hate Crimes Targeting Blacks&#8221;. can you say, &#8220;Racebaiting&#8221;? </p>

			<p>this is none other than a witch hunt to prosecute whites. this law in effect makes every confrontation between a white and a black a federal hate crime against the white. it is designed to over-rule local law enforcement who have decided to dismiss a dispute between a black and a white. blacks can now openly hassle you and start a fight with you and you cant protect yourself without being charged with a hate crime, and this is all sponsored and supported by white democratic politicians(durbin of il., and kennedy of ma.), and supported by the rest of the democratic politicians.  the only way to  get this country back is to vote every democratic politician out of office forever and always. they are so hung up on the slavery issue, it consumes their every waking hour. they continue to live in the 1840s,and its all revenge driven.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;hate crimes laws, including proposed federal legislation, do not criminalize free speech. Instead they criminalize the action that is motivated by bias, not the bias isolated from the crime. It is no different than enhancing the penalty for a murder that was pre-meditated (i.e. thought out in advance). Simply put, the intent of the perpetrator enhances the crime. Hate crimes should not be judged any differently.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is incorrect.  &#8220;Hate&#8221; crimes laws actually do criminalize thought and/or speech.  The author completely misses the fact that enhanced penalties for other crimes (e.g. murder)are not imposed for motive.</p>
<p>Premeditated murder receives a harsher penalty than second-degree murder because of the degree of the actor&rsquo;s intent.  The actor&rsquo;s motive is not figured into the penalty, as with a &#8220;hate&#8221; crime.  </p>
<p>If one plans to murder someone for money or out of jealousy the sentence is enhanced because of the deliberate act of premeditation, not because of the motive for the murder.  If someone kills someone without pre-planning for those very same reasons, the sentence is not enhanced even though the motive is the same. In other words, sentences are enhanced not because someone committed murder for money or out of jealousy but because the person pre-planned the murder. That is what makes the person more culpable or blameworthy, not their thoughts or motives.  Likewise, enhanced penalties for the commission of a crime with a weapon do not penalize the motive for the crime or the thought behind the crime but the act by which the crime is committed.  If someone commits a crime with a gun, for example, they are more culpable because their actions put the victim and others at greater risk.  The reason for the crime is immaterial; the act of causing greater harm or risk of harm is the reason for the enhanced penalty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hate&#8221; crimes laws seek to punish thoughts and/or speech, unlike any other category of law.  And that is a truly dangerous precedent.  <br>

			<p>Interesting numbers.  As soon as I saw that &#8220;40,000&#8221;,  I recognized it as the number of whites raped by blacks in America every year.    Perhaps this is an attempt to finally regard these horrible attacks as something actually involving hate.</p>
<p>You may ask: &#8220;But how do these black rapists become counted as victims?&#8221;  Counting perpetrators as victims is nothing new to liberals!  Particularly black ones. </p>
<p>Maybe they are counting any resistance or revulsion on the part of these whites towards their attackers constitutes criminal hatred, for which their rape was well-deserved but insufficient punishment.  </p>
<p>Or maybe they count any negative reactions: words, facial expressions or body language on the part of the white fiance, father, mother, sister, brother, child or neighbor of those who hear of the rape- as racial hatred that must be spotlighted, criminalized, punished &amp; eliminated from our (?) society. </p>
<p>Maybe they are counting any crime committed against any black, even when perpetrated by a black criminal, under the proposition that it is after all whitey&rsquo;s racist system that makes blacks become criminals in the first place.  </p>
<p>For a second, I wondered if they were counting all the utterances of the word which must not be named, which rhymes with &#8220;bigger&#8221;, including by blacks (for the &#8216;reason&rsquo; mentioned above), but in that case the numbers would be beyond counting&hellip;</p>
<p>The most likely thing, however, is the most obvious: they are full of sh..  (Sorry! How about:   They lie. )</p>
<p>The nature of the lie (and the incredible amount of effort to cover up and deny the obvious truth ) betrays the agenda of those who propagate it.   <br>

			<p>This &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221; legislation will bring the final reckoning just that much closer. That&rsquo;s fine with me.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is the stupidity of the people in power.<br>
They got a wakeup call with these &#8220;Tea Party&#8221; demonstrations and blithely choose to ignore them and go along as if nothing happened. Oh well, as they say, &#8220;you can lead a horse to water, but you can&rsquo;t make him drink.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Opposition to current hate crime legislation is really a debate about who is an American and more importantly who we believe is not.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s easy. An American is someone who is an American citizen. Also, hate crime legislation is not necessary because it already is against the law to murder, assault or harass someone. </p>

			<p>There a number of black men who rape white women because they are white.  These women are being targeted because of their race and gender (obviously).  Why are those not listed as hate crimes?  How many laws and programs do we have to create and enforce to pamper anyone who is not a white, heterosexual, able-bodied, Christian, two-eyed, non-transgendered male?  I&rsquo;m so sick of all these groups claiming to be victims just to get power.</p>

			<p>They got it half-right. Federal hate-crime laws are necessary. They&rsquo;re needed to expose and prosecute the blatant and overwhelming higher proportion of crimes committed against whites. They couldn&rsquo;t be needed more. But, I suppose attempting to defend the rights of set upon whites folks is considered some kind of hate speech.</p>

			<p>Every reader of AmRen should print out Jared Taylor&rsquo;s &#8220;The Color Crime&#8221; and read it from time to time.  Black on white crime is overwhelming greater than the obverse, though blacks constitute &#8220;only&#8221; 13% of the US population,</p>
<p>Are we to believe that these are &#8220;love crimes?&#8221;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what discrimination is?</p>
<p>Hm.  Twenty years ago I got my first job at a fast-food place in the Detroit area.  I was the ONLY white person working there. One manager rode my back constantly and I dreaded going to work.  On top of that, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I was supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>One time my dad asked her why I wasn&rsquo;t getting more hours and she had the nerve to tell him &#8220;white girls don&rsquo;t work as good as black girls.&#8221;  Yes, that&rsquo;s what she told him!  (And looking back, she&rsquo;d told a bald-faced lie to boot.)</p>
<p>Dad took action there, since I was only 16.  That manager wound up getting transferred, last I heard.</p>
<p>So, yes, I&rsquo;ve experienced discrimination based on race.</p>

<p>Great point. And what&rsquo;s equally if not more disturbing, is the number of white men who are raped in prison every day by black and hispanic inmates. One primal function of the penal institution, is to give men, and women, the &#8220;right&#8221; to rehabilitate and reform themselves while being incarcerated before being released back out into society. </p>

			<p>Here is something about the very first anti White liberal propagandist, Heinrich Graetz.  There is a lot more about him on google, mostly adulatory articles about what a wonderful historian he was.</p>
<p> ResistDefamation.org</p>
<p>Graetz Legacy</p>
<p>The ideology and techniques of the campaign of defamation may be traced back to the vulgar activities of a man named Heinrich Graetz who launched a propaganda campaign of &#8220;scourging&#8221; and &#8220;flogging&#8221; the majority demographic in his home country (Germany) in 1868, as well as a parallel propaganda campaign &#8220;to shatter Christianity.&#8221; </p>
<p>[Information about Heinrich Graetz may be found at pages 91 and 141 in Alfred S. Lindemann&rsquo;s 1997 book, &#8220;Esau&rsquo;s Tears.&#8221;]</p>
<p>The Graetz campaign is one of calumny and hatred against the majority demographic (whatever it might be in the area where the defamer chooses to live) and the majority religion (whatever it might be in the same area) to destabilize and silence members of that group and religion. </p>
<p>Heinrich Graetz (1817 - 1891) began a new era, a mean-spirited ideological, defamatory, and propagandistic legacy that endures to this day. His bashing program has been in place for 141 years since 1868. Understanding his legacy of hate speech and propaganda explains why so much media and entertainment agitprop in the USA attacks the diverse white American peoples and Christians simultaneously. Others of his ilk have other demographic and religious targets depending on their whereabouts.</p>
<p>The Graetz legacy is displayed by writers and editors for the dominant media culture who embrace their craft to silence, smear, and destroy people who are disfavored by left-wing racialists. </p>
<p>Howard Zinn and Noel Ignatiev are followers of (and the late Susan Sontag was a follower of) and competitors with Heinrich Graetz in seeking to out-do him and each other for the most stinging comment and the most demoralizing phrase to destroy our children&rsquo;s right to a decent sense of self-respect.</p>
<p><br>
The Graetz legacy cannot be placated. The Graetz legacy will never stop. The diverse Euro-American peoples must come to recognize and understand this. </p>
<p>The reason the Graetz legacy will never die is because it is based on the deformed mental and emotional characteristics of his followers who find pathological excitement (a &#8220;fire in the mind&#8221;) in destruction and defamation. They have no positive program for a better society. There is no appeasement that would end their campaign of defamation. </p>
<p>Other techniques favored by the Graetz legacy are the venomous application of so-called critical theory (deceptive theoretical constructs that &#8220;criticize&#8221; in the most malignant way possible), ridicule, historical omissions and deceptions, the techniques of deconstruction, universalist claims, and the legacy&rsquo;s always useful devices of artful anecdotes and Big Lies.</p>

<p>This is the FIRST TIME I have heard that Matthew Shepherd was a dope dealer on campus, and that his killers were ALSO GAY. Can you provide a link for your accusations?</p>
<p>The way I understood it, (or how the MSM presented it) was that Shepard made overtures to these two men who were enraged that he would do so. In addition, these men were portrayed as &#8220;straight, macho cowboy&#8221; types. I knew that Shepard was also HIV - positive (from an Amren article), something else the MSM conveniently ignored.</p>

			<p>What lies will be told next? I read the net daily and all the cities and towns throughout America and I haven&rsquo;t come across one story where Whites have committed a crime against blacks. But the reverse is a daily event many times over! The media lies over and again to keep stupid Whites in the dark about black on White crime. Why is that, do you suppose?</p>

			<p>      Blacks will benefit from this, but they didn&rsquo;t come up<br>
with it. Liberals, like Kennedy, have put it forward-but they<br>
didn&rsquo;t write it either-although they will enjoy the coming per-<br>
secution immensely. No friends-the ADL wrote it and have backed<br>
with all their immense powers of finance and propaganda. We can&rsquo;t<br>
defeat them if we aren&rsquo;t willing to name the Enemy. The naming<br>
of names comes first. All else flows from that.</p>

			<p>The author, Rod Druher is a gay activist.  This is a great article summing up what is wrong with hate crime and goes as far as a liberal can to point out that it will be directed against Whites and Whites only. Meanwhile hispanics and blacks will continue to be encouraged, enabled and abbetted to continue their war of extermination against Whites by liberal Whites.</p>
<p>The hate crimes law scam<br>
Wednesday May 13, 2009 <br>
 <br>
I completely agree with Andrew Sullivan that hate crimes are a left-wing, thought-policing scam. Here&rsquo;s Andrew:</p>
<p>The real reason for hate crime laws is not the defense of human beings from crime. There are already laws against that - and Matthew Shepard&rsquo;s murderers were successfully prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law in a state with no hate crimes law at the time. </p>
<p>The real reason for the invention of hate crimes was a hard-left critique of conventional liberal justice and the emergence of special interest groups which need boutique legislation to raise funds for their large staffs and luxurious buildings. Just imagine how many direct mail pieces have gone out explaining that without more money for HRC [Human Rights Campaign, a gay lobby   &mdash;   RD], more gay human beings will be crucified on fences. It&rsquo;s very, very powerful as a money-making tool &hellip;</p>
<p><br>
How do you prove intent? If a black man rapes a white woman, do we really want to inquire as to whether or not her whiteness was a factor in his decision to rape her? Is the injury to her greater, and the offense against society larger, than the black woman who is raped by a black man? These are the kinds of questions that the crazy &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; designation call up. As Nat Hentoff writes:</p>
<p>This bill would make it a federal crime to willfully cause bodily injury (or try to) because of the victim&rsquo;s actual or perceived &#8220;race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability&#8221; - as explained on the White House Web site, signaling the president&rsquo;s approval. A defendant convicted on these grounds would be charged with a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; in addition to the original crime, and would get extra prison time. <br>
The extra punishment applies only to these &#8220;protected classes.&#8221; As Denver criminal defense lawyer Robert J Corry Jr. asked (Denver Post April 28): &#8220;Isn&rsquo;t every criminal act that harms another person a &#8216;hate crime&rsquo;? </p>
<p>Then, regarding a Colorado &#8220;hate crime&#8221; law, one of 45 such state laws, Corry wrote: &#8220;When a Colorado gang engaged in an initiation ritual of specifically seeking out a &#8220;white woman&#8221; to rape, the Boulder prosecutor declined to pursue &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; charges.&#8221; She was not enough of one of its protected classes.</p>
<p>Corey adds that the state &#8220;hate crime&#8221; law - like the newly expanded House of Representatives federal bill - &#8220;does not apply equally&#8221; (as the 14th Amendment requires), essentially instead &#8220;criminalizing only politically incorrect thoughts directed against politically incorrect victim categories.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a Republican or Democrat, think hard about what Corry adds: &#8220;A government powerful enough to pick and choose which thoughts to prosecute is a government too powerful.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
What about equal justice under the law? For backers of these Orwellian statutes   &mdash;   and these supporters are all on the Left, are they not?   &mdash;   some victims are more equal than others. Good on Andrew Sullivan for standing up for what&rsquo;s right.</p>

<p>I agree. Foxman and Morris Dees are basically  con men, and extortionists. Unlike other extortionists, they don&rsquo;t have to do anything but make up lies about imaginary enemies.  Real extortionists have to occasionally hijack a truck, or trash a business to keep the payments coming.</p>
<p>100 years ago an ambitious young person who couldn&rsquo;t find a good job started his own business.  Nowadays an ambitious young person creates a liberal cause and forms a non profit foundation supported by the White taxpayers he wants to exterminate.</p>
<p>We always have a spate of &#8220;hate&#8221; graffiti about a month before certain fundraisers come to town.  Wonder why</p>

			<p>Here is an insurance company hate crime fraud check list.</p>
<p> Hate Crime Hoaxes</p>
<p>The media seem to simply forget about hate crime hoaxes as they are exposed, and never inquire as to whether the next big hate crime story is a hoax. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, any alleged hate crime that meets these three criteria is frequently a hate crime hoax:</p>
<p>(1) There is no witness. </p>
<p>(2) There is a political or academic pay-off in terms of public recognition, pending criminal legislation, financial gain, or canceled tests.</p>
<p>(3) The criminal act is limited to writing, whether on the body of the alleged victim or on property. </p>

			<p>I have often wondered why almost any group of people coming to America have a certain distrust and distaste for American blacks, this includes black themselves coming from place like Sudan? I wonder if these poor mistreated American blacks have any responsibility at all concernig the way so many others seem to feel about them?</p>

			<p>The Leviathan has, as its principle objective, the elimination of its greatest threat, White Advocacy.<br>
It goes about making this an impossibility in many ways knows to all here at AR.<br>
And this Matt Shepard Hate Crime Act is one of them.<br>
They are going to morph into paranoid prevention in no time flat.<br>
They will be introduced with the idea of prosecution of crimes committed so as to send a message to anyone thinking of hurting a non-white.  But they will be applied to Whites the second we organize as a &#8220;prevention&#8221; against &#8220;possible&#8221; hate crimes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of a well-orchestrated attempt to eliminate Freedom of Speech (which keeps us from talking about what one writer from VDARE refered to as &#8220;Hate Facts&#8221;) and Assembly.<br>
Once that is done there won&rsquo;t be much stopping non-Whites from dealing with Whites as they see fit.</p>
<p>If they have no problem slandering us in History books they won&rsquo;t have a problem slaughtering us in the streets.  In fact, an argument could be made that the former was re-written to inspire the latter.</p>
<p>So, it really looks like a race to the finish, ie; Can we organize before it&rsquo;s too late?</p>

			<p>When Malvo took up his rifle and muttered &#8220;I&rsquo;m going to kill 10 white people a day&#8221;, that still wasn&rsquo;t enough to even bring in the idea of hate-crime charges. </p>
<p>A 20 to 1 assault of a white woman on a bus opening with &#8220;Stupid white bitch&#8221; was not enough to invoke hate-crime charges.</p>
<p>A 6-1 beating death on a *93 year old woman* exiting a supermarket on camera with audio of perpetrators shouting &#8220;Get the white bitch&#8221;, &#8220;You are a white devil&#8221; and &#8220;Kill the white bitch&#8221; was also not enough to invoke hate crimes charges.</p>
<p>Pretty much the only way hate crimes charges get filed if the victim is a white is if the victim is also gay, and even then its rare. </p>
<p>We need to fight this one, and instead ask for a lynching law. Lynching being defined as when two or more people attack or kill someone of another race. It will still fly and be salable to the multicults, but it might actually do the job of enhancing these types of assaults in a fair way. </p>
