<h1>Black-Ruled Town in Danger of Dying in Alabama</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, May 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The cafes, the school and the roller rink are long gone from Alabama&rsquo;s oldest black city. Empty homes and businesses line the narrow streets.</p>
<p>Hobson City has no police or fire department, and weeds have overgrown the oldest part of the cemetery and a park.</p>
<p>But this small town once thrived as a place where black people were in charge in the midst of the Jim Crow South.</p>
<p>Now, with the town on the verge of dying, preservationists have put the east Alabama landmark on the critical list. The Alabama Historical Commission this month included the town of 878 people on its annual inventory of &#8220;Places in Peril.&#8221;</p>
<p>The commission&rsquo;s list typically includes historic structures, such as old homes and abandoned theaters. Hobson City is an exception: an entire town that in recent decades has seen its foundation collapse.</p>
<p>Incorporated in 1899, Hobson City was formed 12 years after Eatonville, Fla., which calls itself the nation&rsquo;s oldest black city.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hobson City&rsquo;s residents created &#8220;a thriving municipality, which people at the time said couldn&rsquo;t be done because blacks couldn&rsquo;t govern,&#8221; said Dorothy Walker, public outreach coordinator with the Alabama Historical Commission. &#8220;If it is someday absorbed into another city, it will lose that historic identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A two-mile-long sliver about 60 miles east of Birmingham, Hobson City is as narrow as a few hundred yards in places. Wedged between two predominantly white cities, Oxford and Anniston, it has a few white residents.</p>
<p>During the 1800s, Walker said, it was an all-black section of Oxford called Mooree Quarter, a possible reference to old slave quarters in the area. Residents were allowed to vote, but whites maintained control.</p>
<p>The racial relationship shifted in the 1890s when the people of Mooree Quarter swayed an election, Walker said. The state had not yet disenfranchised blacks  &mdash;  that wouldn&rsquo;t happen until 1901. So, Walker said, whites petitioned state leaders to de-annex Mooree Quarter.</p>
<p>Kicked out of Oxford, blacks incorporated a new city and named it for Richmond P. Hobson, a white Spanish-American War hero from Alabama who was later elected to Congress. The 1900 Census put the new town&rsquo;s population at 292.</p>
<p>Hobson City grew to about 1,500 people by the mid-1900s, with restaurants, laundries, stores, a skating rink and other businesses. The town was poor, but had a vibrant culture centered on the all-black vocational school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Federal anti-poverty money flowed to Hobson City in the 1960s, and federal aid helped build a modern municipal complex in the 1970s. But in an ironic twist, McCrory said, the end of racial segregation sent the city into a tailspin around the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I think I wouldn&rsquo;t have gone out and done all that marching if I realized how much we were going to lose,&#8221; said McCrory, 61, who participated in civil rights protests as a young woman.</p>
<p>The all-black Calhoun County Training School became an integrated elementary school in 1972, and fair housing laws meant blacks could live elsewhere. Many who could afford to move away did so, costing Hobson City hundreds of residents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city still has a police car and a fire truck, but it can&rsquo;t afford officers or firefighters. County deputies handle police calls, and neighboring cities help with fires.</p>
<p>Being tabbed a &#8220;Place in Peril&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t include any special funding, but McCrory hopes it will increase public awareness of the town&rsquo;s plight.</p>
<p>She dreams of a campaign to raise $1 million in donations, which could lead to federal and state matching grants.</p>

			<p>How could it be so prosperous when it relied so much (and wants to continue to rely) on Federal money?  Seems more like a collective welfare client than anything.</p>

			<p>Blascks really are capable of running a city and governing themselves-but thet just cant do it as well as any other race on the planet.So they migrate to places that are run better by non blacks, and afterward they complain,moan and blame all of their woes on Whitey or anyone else.</p>

<p>Interesting.  It would appear that Ms. McCrory is insinuating that once given the choice, blacks chose to live amongst whites instead of each other.</p>

			<p>This happens all over the place. People move away from small towns and they eventually dry up and blow away, it is human nature. It is only considered newsworthy when it is a historically Black town that this happens to. </p>

			<p>The kind of integration blacks need is integration with the black professional, white collar and trades people classes.  When segregatioin was allowed the different classes of blacks had to live together.  This gave lower class blacks inspiration from their own kind on how to move up.  It tempered the lower classes  tendency towards crime.  It isn&rsquo;t white flight, it is black flight from their own that has really doomed black America.</p>

<p>Most Blacks prefer to be around their own. They want to be able to integrate with whites on their terms only but don&rsquo;t want whites to have the same right. Yet, usually blacks want to be around their own.<br>

			<p>my daddy always said my hometown of memphis was at its very best during segregation - especially for the blacks where their side was kept up nicely with great shops, thriving black-owned businesses including banks and department stores.  everyone cared for their side of town because it was theirs.  schools in memphis were among the best in the nation, and that included all-black schools - sources of pride in the community.  sadly, most of the memphis i grew up in is now dangerous ghetto, or close to it.  i guess that&rsquo;s what our famed civil rights movement has done to a once great urban municipality.  very sad</p>

			<p>The death of an all-black town is not surprising.  After Jim Crow, aspiring and upwardly mobile blacks were more free to enter the wider economy and compete outside their insular communities.  Educated and monied black professionals moved out and the remaining residents were increasingly low income recipients of the burgeoning welfare state.  Franchise restaurants and chain stores tested these black towns, found them mostly unprofitable and left, including black owned businesses like Church&rsquo;s Fried Chicken. With empty commercial properties and so many low income families, the tax base quickly eroded and the towns died.  This same pattern is exactly what happened to a city that was once one of America&rsquo;s largest metropolitan centers, Detroit. The Motor City today has lost more than half of its population and looks like a war-torn wasteland where much of its real estate is essentially worthless. Gary, Indiana, is in its own death throes for the same reason.</p>
<p>There is an all-black town in North Florida that has been glorified by historians and multiculturists. American Beach in fact remains the only predominantly black community on Florida&rsquo;s considerable coastline. Tour buses regularly ply into town to hear of its history. Through the early 1960s, there was a thriving boardwalk, restaurants, jazz clubs, and a massive bath house (part of which still stands) where thousands of blacks from Jacksonville and beyond congregated, socialized, and bathed in the beautiful Amelia Island sea. Segregation made the place boom, but integration led to its incremental demise.  Alas, today American beach boasts no amenities, no beachfront restaurants, or jazz performances.  There are weedy empty lots, dilapidated housing, and the lowest priced oceanside properties in Florida.  Yes, there are a few brave black Atlanta attorneys building there, but big developers can&rsquo;t buy anything due to the thorny problem of &#8220;heirs&rsquo; property&#8221; wherein clear titles are impossible to obtain. Phantom owners coming out of the woodwork to claim partial ownership of a resort hotel inhibits development, but dispersed deed holders  do keep American Beach black.  The tour buses are mostly filled with black college students or African Americans on heritage tours.  How sad it must be for them to see this pathetic beach town hemmed in between upscale Amelia Island resorts to their north and south. On the upside, American Beach is a relatively peaceful and safe community with ample beach access for all residents. The tallest sand dune in Florida, named &#8220;Na Na&#8221;, is there. It is far more livable than Detroit, at least since the Jamaican druglords were run out of town.</p>

			<p>A million dollars?  And a million to match? Well, if you can trust what you see on Google Maps Street View(and you can&rsquo;t), that would by you the entire town and neighboring Anniston and Oxford, as well!  Rural America is full of dying, dilapidated towns that look exactly like this, however, it looks like the Google guys were doing quite a bit of touch-up on this one.  </p>
<p>An amusing side note:  if you look on the corner of Pyle Ave. and Constantine, you can see where they forgot to block out a couple of convicts doing road work!</p>

			<p>Of course blacks can run governments successfully.  Just look at how Africa has thrived since the white man left, especially Zimbabwe and South Africa, the rape and crime capitols of the world.</p>
<p>And just look at the great successes of the black cities in the US are, especially, Detroit, New Orleans, and Los Angeles.</p>

			<p>It is very very sad but true, towns seemed to do better for all races under segregation. It is awful that Blacks now have what they want but do not understand that with rights come responsibilities and have not kept up their end of the bargain. A good book to read is &#8220;Stupid Black Men&#8221; by Dr Larry Elder. He tells it like it is and in a way that most White people would not dream of. I have known some very intellegent Black people but unfortunately the angry and relatively unintellegent ones tend to stick out more in my memory. </p>

Blacks complain about this all the time. They go on and on about segregation and in the next sentence pine about the way things used to be in their communities &#8216;back in the day&rsquo;. Segregation was supposedly bad but integration destroyed black communities.</p>
<p>These people can&rsquo;t get what they want because they don&rsquo;t know what they want.</p>
<p>And again, when can I lay claim to my historically white neighborhood? Oh yeah, whites can&rsquo;t make that claim. Silly me.</p>
<p><b>The Black Golden Rule: That which is white must be made black. That which is black must remain black.</b></p>

			<p>Government action is like a steroid, and once the federal money started flowing in during the 60s and 70s they got hooked and forgot how to take care of themselves.  You wish them luck but now they&rsquo;re sitting waiting for another bailout.  The government is a giant ham-handed oaf, handing out a million dollars here an there, letting a good thing die through desegregation, and then letting a bad thing live through life support by throwing more money on a dead ideal.</p>

			<p>I have lived in Anniston for over a year and have heard of Hobson city but never knew&hellip; and still don&rsquo;t, know where it is. The story should focus on the destruction blacks caused to Anniston and the soaring crime rates and destruction of schools in this small town.</p>

<p>Like returning combat veterans from Viet-Nam (like myself) that re-adjusted easily to civil life (I spent 3 1/2 years there) we didn&rsquo;t make good news. But the few that did NOT adjust well, those poor souls are the ones the news was all about. and laid the groundwork for the public perception of all combat veterans then and now.</p>

			<p>One consequence of ending segregation was that the better-off and more educated blacks (what was once known as &#8216;the talented tenth&rsquo;) were free to leave the black areas and settle in White ones. This was a &#8216;brain drain&rsquo;.</p>
