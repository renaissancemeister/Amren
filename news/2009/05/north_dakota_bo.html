			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Mytelka, Chronicle of Higher Education, May 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>North Dakota&rsquo;s State Board of Higher Education stepped up the deadline for the University of North Dakota to resolve the long-running dispute over its &#8220;Fighting Sioux&#8221; nickname today, voting unanimously to require the university to either drop the nickname or persuade two Sioux tribes to endorse its continuing use by this fall, the Grand Forks Herald reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The board&rsquo;s action today would move the deadline to October 1, apparently because of the university&rsquo;s eagerness to join a new athletic conference, the Summit League. According to the Herald, the league has told the university that it will not consider North Dakota for membership until the &#8220;Fighting Sioux&#8221; dispute is settled.</p>
<p>One of the two Sioux tribes in North Dakota, the Spirit Lake Sioux, has already voted to let the university keep the mascot, but the leaders of the other tribe oppose it. A vote by that tribe, the Standing Rock Sioux, has not yet been scheduled.</p>

			<p>Why would White people want to name a sports team after a stone-age people like the Lakota?</p>
<p>I suggest that the Fighting Sioux be abandoned for &#8220;The Pioneers.&#8221;  After all, the pioneers ended up winning the deadly game played against the Lakota more than one hundred years ago.</p>

			<p>By now the white european community knows the drill. My advice -think of a much better mascot that does not HONOR the Souix but instead honors the fighting pathfinders or fighting white men.<br>
I tell you the Souix will demand we take their name back as mascot.</p>

			<p>Fine, get rid of the fighting Sioux. And the Fighting Illini. And the Washington Redskins. Its a conspiracy by the white man to make people forget that Indians were ever here. The same people who removed Sacajawea from the dollar coin.</p>
<p>One day soon there will be no Indian symbols in public life and all the Indians who are left will be out on the Res getting drunk. When someone then refer to Indians people will think of Sanjaya.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m Norwegian and live in Minnesota.  I am proud to have the Vikings represent Minnesota even though they did not have horns on their helmets.<br>
We need to tell these whiny minorities to kiss off.</p>

			<p>They should rename the team the Redskins. The Washington team won&rsquo;t be using that name much longer.</p>

			<p>Agree with the above. </p>
<p>You want to take the name Fighting Krauts I won&rsquo;t object.</p>
<p>On second thought, that might cause even more trouble from the PC crowd. Just imagine the logo. </p>
<p>So, safer to just go with the Invisible Purple Unicorns. </p>

			<p>What is this insatiable desire on the part of Whites to not offend? Does any other race in the world have this psychotic need to destroy themselves and their lands? I don&rsquo;t care what Indians think or want, nor do I care what Mestizos, Arabs, Asians, or Blacks think and want. Did I leave anyone out? If so, I am sooo sorry to &#8220;offend&#8221; ya&rsquo;all.</p>

			<p>A few years back there was a high school team named &#8220;The Fightin&rsquo; Whities&#8221;  The PC people thought that this would be kind of a &#8220;see how you guys like it&#8221; sort of thing.  However, White people took to it and were rooting for them and buying memorabilia.  Since Whites weren&rsquo;t offended, the Fightin&rsquo; Whities were made to change their name.</p>

			<p>I have a T-shirt that my mother gave me that says &#8220;Eliminate Racism  &mdash;  Stop Using Native Americans as Mascots.&#8221;  Then it shows Chief Wahoo, then a white guy with the similar goofy grin, then a black guy with a comb in his hair, and some Asian guy looking squinty-eyed, same idiotic grin.  I wear it just for the fun of it  &mdash;  to me it&rsquo;s tongue-in-cheek.  Oh  &mdash;  and I live in Ohio.  LOL</p>
<p>I have Cherokee ancestry and my mother looks Native herself.  I personally don&rsquo;t care who/what you use as a mascot, but a caricature  &mdash;  like Chief Wahoo  &mdash;  goes a bit too far.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m hardly a bleeding-heart liberal, but does it really hurt to get an opinion on things like this?  Why needlessly offend people?  If you want to honor a Native tribe, then what&rsquo;s the harm in asking a few chiefs, hey, what do you guys think of this?</p>
<p>This reminds me of when an Akron baseball team wanted to name their team the Blasts, in honor of Challenger astronaut and Akron native Judith Resnik.  Some objected because &#8220;blast&#8221; reminded them of how she died.  So, they worked things out and the team is called the Aeroes.    </p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not saying people should be hyper-sensitive&hellip;but don&rsquo;t go out of your way to provoke people either.  I just generally believe in considering the feelings of others.  I find Chief Wahoo, for example, a bit offensive, but as I indicated in another thread, there are bigger fish to fry.  We don&rsquo;t need to major in the minors.</p>

			<p>Alexandra&hellip;..I don&rsquo;t know where you have been in the last few decades.  Go out of our way, to provoke? Who provokes who in this country? I believe Whites are provoked daily 24/7 by ALL other races and Whites are constantly backing down so as not to &#8220;offend&#8221; any other race of people. Yet all these &#8220;other people&#8221; have no such concern for offending us in our own land that was formed and built for White Europeans and their progeny.</p>
<p> This wasn&rsquo;t a country until they came and made it one. There most certainly was no law and order anywhere to be seen. Indians killed Indians and warred against each other way before the White man came. Put down that book about the Noble Red Man and read what Amren has on file for once.</p>

			<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean any specific race when I say don&rsquo;t provoke.  I&rsquo;m not saying be a doormat either.  I&rsquo;m just saying don&rsquo;t go *looking* for trouble.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read any books about the Noble Red Man.  Sorry.  And I recognize that there was no nation here until we colonized it, then declared independence  &mdash;  I know that already and keep telling that to these goofs who claim the colonists were the first illegals.  (So there were no illegal immigrants prior to 1776.  Or any immigrants!)  And I know the tribes were warring against each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like having a bully in your class.  You don&rsquo;t want to start something with him, but if he starts bothering you, you don&rsquo;t back down, and you put up a fight if necessary.  See what I&rsquo;m getting at?</p>
