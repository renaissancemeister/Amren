			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Spencer S. Hsu, Washington Post, May 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Obama administration is expanding a program initiated by President George W. Bush aimed at checking the immigration status of virtually every person booked into local jails. In four years, the measure could result in a tenfold increase in illegal immigrants who have been convicted of crimes and identified for deportation, current and former U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>By matching inmates&rsquo; fingerprints to federal immigration databases, authorities hope to pinpoint deportable illegal immigrants before they are released from custody. Inmates in federal and state prisons already are screened. But authorities generally lack the time and staff to do the same at local jails, which house up to twice as many illegal immigrants at any time and where inmates come and go more quickly.</p>
<p>The effort is likely to significantly reshape immigration enforcement, current and former executive branch officials said. It comes as the Obama administration and Democratic leaders in Congress vow to crack down on illegal immigrants who commit crimes, rather than those who otherwise abide by the law.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has made it &#8220;very clear&#8221; that her top priority is deporting illegal immigrants who have committed crimes, said David J. Venturella, program director at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The effort differs from programs in several Northern Virginia counties where local law enforcement officers have been deputized to question suspects about whether they are in the country legally. In Montgomery County, police provide immigration authorities the names of those arrested on charges of violent crimes and handgun violations.</p>
<p>Under the new program, the immigration checks will be automatic: Fingerprints currently being run through the FBI&rsquo;s criminal history database also will be matched against immigration databases maintained by the Department of Homeland Security. The effort would not catch people who have never been fingerprinted by U.S. authorities.</p>
<p>Based on the pilot program, the agency estimates that if fingerprints from all 14 million bookings in local jails each year were screened, about 1.4 million &#8220;criminal aliens&#8221; would be found, Venturella said. That would be about 10 times the 117,000 criminal illegal immigrants ICE deported last year. There are more than 3,100 local jails nationwide, compared with about 1,200 federal and state prisons.</p>
<p>The program, known as Secure Communities, &#8220;presents an historic opportunity to transform immigration enforcement,&#8221; said Julie Myers Wood, who launched it last year while head of ICE.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics say that deporting the worst criminal illegal immigrants, by itself, does not go far enough because it would not fully address the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in the United States or deter further illegal immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Amnesty International and immigrant advocates warn that the change could lead to immigration checks in other arenas and the &#8220;criminalization&#8221; of illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Tom Barry, an analyst for the Center for International Policy, a nonprofit research and policy institute in Washington, said the initiative could sweep up foreign-born U.S. residents who have served time for offenses but were not deported.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many, many legal immigrants are going to be pulled into this net even for minor violations that they&rsquo;re booked for  &mdash;  traffic violations, drunk driving, whatever  &mdash;  and after they&rsquo;ve lived here 10 or 20 years, they&rsquo;re going to be deported,&#8221; Barry said.</p>
<p>By checking all people who are booked, supporters say, the program avoids racial profiling. It also could stem what some see as overzealous efforts by some local authorities who, through a $60 million-a-year ICE training program, have stepped up their pursuit of illegal immigrants through measures such as neighborhood sweeps and traffic stops.</p>

			<p>This is the left&rsquo;s contribution toward pretending to care about responsible immigration.</p>
<p>They think they&rsquo;re just going to see a little over a million illegals identified as criminals and kicked out of the country, but they&rsquo;re not taking into consideration the fact that the increasing jobless rate is going to encourage more of the growing unemployed to turn to crime and that 1 plus million, more likely than not, is going to really be about 5 or 6 million.</p>
<p>But, if DHS is really sincere about identifying these people on the local jail level, I DO have to say that they at least are doing something right.  It remains to be seen, however, if they really follow through.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of pro-illegal kooks on the scene today.  Geraldo Rivera is constantly sputtering, stuttering, getting red in the face, nearly in tears, wanting everyone to believe mestizos have a lower rate of crime than anyone else. Maybe that&rsquo;s true if they&rsquo;re compared to blacks, but mestizos, legal and illegal, have tremondously high crime rates throughout the country.</p>
<p>I lived in the L.A. area, Colorado, Nevada and Texas, and I KNOW first hand that where mestizos are it isn&rsquo;t safe to keep anything in an auto overnight, nor anything outside the house or garage, or it will be gone by morning.</p>
<p>The theft in heavy mestizo areas is legendary.</p>
<p>Geraldo is a nut case that should see a shrink for his sick infatuation with mestizos.  I think his real name is Jerry Rivers.  But I&rsquo;m not sure. He must have changed it to a Hispanic one because of his illness.  He has went on SEVERAL unreasonable rages on Bill O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s show, at least once with O&rsquo;Reilly in a screaming match and once with Michelle Malkin, where he said he&rsquo;d like to spit in her face because she quoted stats which verified high incidents of mestizo pathologies.</p>
<p>Several days ago he referred to &#8220;people of color, like me,&#8221; yet if he isn&rsquo;t Caucasian it mystifies me just what he might be.  </p>
<p>These people absolutely love to refer to the right as having something &#8220;wrong&#8221; with them, but the obviously mentally unbalanced prople are all on the PC left.</p>

			<p>Amnesty International and immigrant advocates warn that the change could lead to immigration checks in other arenas and the &ldquo;criminalization&rdquo; of illegal immigration.</p>
<p>When I read this I had to scratch my head and take a second look at it. <br>
Are you kidding me? Illegal immigration is a crime and those that break said law are criminals. <br>
How can you decriminalize a crime? Only in a PC left hand bizzaro world does this rule apply. <br>
The open borders crowd will be pushing hard to thwart this feeble to little to late attempt to enforce the law. <br>
What is next on the crowd pleaser menu? Maybe voting reform? Get those dead people and illegal voters off the roles? </p>

			<p>To the above poster. Geraldo is not Caucasian. Maybe check wiki to see what his ethnicity is.</p>

			<p>I lived in what&rsquo;s known as a poor White town for 16 years. Never got ripped off once. Then I moved to a poor Hispanic city. Got ripped off 6 times in little over a year and had some property damaged to boot. The thefts were minor but still. And there was a lot of loaning money and then never having it come back. Hispanic areas are not really dangerous if you ask me, but there is a lot of theft.</p>
<p>Jerry Rivers is some kind of Puerto Rican who is mostly White. He is also part Jewish. He changed his name from Rivers to Rivera to cash in on being the being ethnic fad.</p>
<p>This should be easy to do. I went to traffic court the other day and 80% of the cases were obviously illegal aliens driving without licenses. Around here, they pretty much all get remanded to ICE after they get booked if they are illegal, and I&rsquo;d say about 1/2 the town is illegal aliens. </p>
<p>I wish they would deport the ones who have not done any OTHER crimes either. Obviously being an illegal invader is a crime?</p>
<p>Amnesty International warned that this will lead to the &#8220;criminalization of illegal immigration.&#8221; That has to be one of the funniest sentences I have read in a while. It&rsquo;s already against the law, dummies!</p>

			<p>My daughters&rsquo; neighbors used to live in a Texas border town.  They said that when they came to live here in a nice suburban town far from the border, they were so surprised to see how people had nice things like wreaths on their doors and lawn ornaments.  Where they lived in Texas anything like that would have been stolen. They were also surprised to see houses that had no iron grates over the windows.  </p>

			<p>This is a good first step, if they are really being honest with us.  Of course, there should be a lot more done, but this will have an effect on the illegal community.  First, there is a generally lawless attitude among many illegals.  They just seem to think that the laws don&rsquo;t apply to them.  They engage in many petty crimes such as driving without a license, driving drunk, using false documents, selling drugs, fighting etc.  I think they have a much higher rate of criminal behavior than Americans.  This will allow for many opportunities for arrests.</p>
<p>Also, many illegals who gets arrested, finger printed and deported will have some dependents living with them such as a wife and kids.  So when the man gets arrested and deported, the wife and kids will also leave with him.  </p>
<p>It would also effect a broader circle of people as word of the deportation will spread throughout the illegal community.  Each deportation can effect perhaps hundreds of illegals who will hear about it either first or second hand.  This will encourage some others to self deport as they will come to the conclusion that the government is finally getting serious about immigration enforcement.  Furthermore, word will get back home to Mexico discouraging others from attempting to migrate here.</p>

			<p>The figure of 11 million for illegals has been used for seven years. Has there not been any illegal immigration for the past 7 years? Anybody who uses that figure has an agenda. That agenda ain&rsquo;t good for Americans.</p>
