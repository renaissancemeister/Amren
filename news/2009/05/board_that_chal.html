<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An advisory board that addressed racial issues in Homestead and Florida City has been dissolved, leading some residents to question whether the move was an attempt to stop their fight against the Confederate Flag.</p>
<p>Led by Homestead Mayor Lynda Bell, all seven members of the Homestead City Council voted on April 20 to shut down the Homestead/Florida City Human Relations Board (HRB).</p>
<p>Bell said the HRB was not taking on matters that are important to the city&rsquo;s residents. The board&rsquo;s members, however, said they believe the city council was trying to block their efforts against the display of the Confederate Flag at taxpayer-funded events.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t help what others think; I will repeat what I stated in public,&#8221; Bell said in an email to the South Florida Times. &#8220;The city of Homestead is no longer a small town. We are 60,000 residents, and are in need of a community relations board of our own, that is more inclusive.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Patricia &#8220;Pat&#8221; Mellerson is one of the founding members of the HRB, and was also its vice-chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;They do not want to deal with the Confederate Flag, and they think that by getting rid of the board, it will go away,&#8221; Mellerson said. &#8220;But I can tell you, it won&rsquo;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>The controversy flared up after black residents complained that they were surprised by Confederate States organizations that were allowed to participate in the November 2008 Veterans Day parade.</p>
<p>The Greater Homestead/Florida City Chamber of Commerce organizes the parade, which receives financial support from the city.  The chamber invited the Sons of Confederate Veterans to participate.</p>
<p>Group members wore Confederate Army uniforms and displayed the Confederate battle flag as they made their way along the parade route, down Krome Avenue. Some black residents who attended the parade said they were offended, and sought to have the organizations and their memorabilia barred from future events.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Citing freedom of speech concerns and the fact that Confederate soldiers received presidential pardons, Chamber of Commerce officials refuse to ban them.</p>
<p>The HRB took up the issue, and sided with black residents who want the groups banned. Homestead officials, however, said it was out of their control because they are not the organizers.</p>
<p>In April, the Miami-Dade County branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) joined the fray. Fearing the possibility of unrest at future events, the civil rights organization petitioned the Miami-Dade County School District to keep students and school bands out of events where the Confederate Flag is displayed.</p>
<p>A week later, on April 20, the Homestead City Council voted to dissolve the Human Relations Board.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Human Relations Board was created in September 2002 after black city workers in Homestead complained of discrimination. Those allegations led to several community meetings where the exchanges often became heated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mellerson said the board has successfully resolved any number of issues brought before it without the support of Bell, including those that involved race, immigration, police profiling, employment and housing.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it was not for us taking a stand on the Confederate Flag, she would have allowed us to continue our work,&#8221; Mellerson said.</p>
<p>Bell, however, said her motives had nothing to do with the Confederate Flag, but rather was a part of streamlining all of the city&rsquo;s boards so they focus on matters within the city of Homestead.</p>

<p>What elsedid she expect when they were appointed?</p>
<p>Has any black group appointed to see to government business done anything at all besides concentrate solely on imagined injustices blacks receive?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example of the elites wanting to give the blacks a token voice, hoping they won&rsquo;t riot and cause them to lose their money, power and positions.</p>
<p>Now, during downtimes they don&rsquo;t have the funds for them, and when crash and burn times get here shortly they&rsquo;re going to have to deal with black riots anyway, no matter how much they were placated.</p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s funny is that some blacks and a good number of Cherokees fought on the side of the Confederacy.</p>
<p>So what are blacks whining about?  They don&rsquo;t like it, they can go live in Africa.</p>

			<p> The South Florida Times appears to be a by-blacks-for-blacks publication, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that their coverage of this seems just a tad biased. The board claims it &#8220;took a stand&#8221; on the Confederate flag, but to most non-blacks it will seem more like &#8220;making an issue&#8221; out of something that should not be one.</p>
<p> Blacks need to &#8220;get over it&#8221; and quit worrying about that flag. Far more slaves were bought and sold under the American flag than ever were under the Confederate flag in the Confederacy&rsquo;s four brief years of existence. If descendants of Confederate veterans want to honor the flag, they should have the right to. Besides, it&rsquo;s a right pretty banner.</p>

			<p>Does it ever, ever&hellip;ever occur to Blacks that everything in this world is NOT somehow about them and only them? Is it possible that certain things, certain ideas, certain symbols may in fact mean many things to many people, and just because Blacks take offense to that something(or indeed to everything)that it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean those things are inherently &#8220;hateful&#8221; or what have you? </p>
<p>This idea that everything on earth must be filtered through and given widespread approval by one dusky &#8220;victim&#8221; group or the other, is the single most obnoxious idea to ever be foisted upon the White race! Why we stand for this is utterly beyond me!!  </p>

			<p>But it is always ok for the New Black Panthers to march, shouting their hateful slogans against White people. And I think no other country&rsquo;s flag should fly in the U.S. other than at their embassies. State flags as usual, fly below the U.S. flag.</p>

			<p>If one doesn&rsquo;t like a certain flay, then don&rsquo;t fly it!  Other than that, it is none of anyones business. Blacks get all over the Confederate flag, but they were slaves under the US flag- doesnt make any sense!</p>

			<p>Confederate soldiers were veterans, therefore they should be commemorated.  </p>
<p>This has nothing to do with 21st century blacks.</p>

<p>Black Africans enslaved more black Africans than EVER did any of the White race. They have no excuses whatsoever in Africa for their abject failure at everything. We see the Congo is at it again and will be forever, as is Burundi and Rwanda. But seriously, what African nation is not at war with it&rsquo;s neighbors.</p>

			<p>If only the reporter did his homework, he would have discovered the Confederate flag is protected under state statute. </p>
<p>He also would have discovered Pat Mellerson lives in Kendall and is not a Homestead taxpayer and or resident. </p>
<p>You see everyone not in the reporters world does not have freedom of speech. The liberals cherry pick who has the right. Very poor job of reporting. </p>
<p>Did he know there is an African-American who voted to reform the Homestead Human Relations Board, again it is all weak reporting and editing to fill the need of the bigotry in the reporters mind. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he is incompetent or lazy or both. I&rsquo;ll leave that to others who have the freedom of speech not granted by Elgin Jones and the non-existent Human Relations Board even though it is protected by Florida law. If you want to serve on a Board in Homestead at least know the law.  </p>

			<p>less than 5% of southerners had anything to do with slavery. its ridiculous to think the other 95% would fight a war so that a measely 5% could own slaves. which leads one to ask why the black obsession with the flag? i personally believe it started during reconstruction when there was still sporadic resistance between union and diehard confederates. union agitators would stir up trouble between blacks and whites in hopes that they would be too busy fighting each other to stage another rebellion. at the time, there was actually a congressional investigation that found this to be the case. now, they continue to make the south the whipping boy to keep the &#8220;state&rsquo;s rights&#8221; argument at bay. there&rsquo;s no way big government is going to let that genii out of the bottle again.</p>

			<p> Maybe I&rsquo;m wierd but couls this flag nonsense be because the HRB board has accomplished it&rsquo;s anti-discrimination goals and is desperatly fishing dor a reason ti exists at taxpayer expense?<br/>
 Maybe it should be disolved simply because it&rsquo;s served its purpose and has become a vestigal organ looking for a reason to continur?</p>

			<p>The Confederate Flag is a legitimate symbol of states that decided to break away from the the inclusion into a larger group, the &#8220;united states.&#8221;   In the beginning, each of them voluntarily requested admission to and were given permission to join.  Who ever on this earth could maintain that any entity&hellip;state or otherwise&hellip;.could not back out of their original agreement to be a part of a larger body?  </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to conclude they have no right to change their minds and opt for exclusion from a larger group that is self-destructing, whether it&rsquo;s a state or any entity that might want to go its separate way, even an individual.  </p>
<p>The constitution does not exclude the right of states to secede.  In fact, the founding fathers believed it was the duty of citizens to cast off a government that evolved to a point where it was no longer operating for the interest of citizens and certainly if it were detrimental to their well-being.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a pertinent quote from Joe Sobran: </p>
<p>&#8220;How can the federal government be prevented from usurping powers that the Constitution doesn&rsquo;t grant to it? It&rsquo;s an alarming fact that few Americans ask this question anymore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our ultimate defense against the federal government is the right of secession. Yes, most people assume that the Civil War settled that. But superior force proves nothing. If there was a right of secession before that war, it should be just as valid now. It wasn&rsquo;t negated because Northern munitions factories were more efficient than Southern ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are right now witnessing the incremental process of states declaring their right of sovereignty through resolutions passed, making it clear that the tenth amendment gives them the authority to do so and that the federal government is imposing power on states it was never granted by the constitution.  State legislative bodies are making it clear that their resolutions are just the first step in declaring themselves as separate political entities that are free of any kind of federal control.</p>
<p>Secessionist movements are springing up everywhere and the &#8220;S&#8221; word has been getting more discussion and play than the &#8220;C&#8221; word.  Peaceful separation is much preferred by people than open civil conflict.</p>
<p>So, wouldn&rsquo;t blacks have a shreiking hissy fit if a cabal of states won the right of exclusion from the US and adopted the banner of the confederate flag as their symbol?  If a state is successful in leaving the union, blacks could always move to a state that is of a more liberal bent, if their imagined injustices are too overwhelming for them, and drag that area down to a third world levels, just as they&rsquo;ve done to every city they&rsquo;ve controlled in recent times. </p>
<p>After that they could continue on with their contentious, unintelligent babble between each other all they want, as their world slowly implodes, as it does everywhere in the world.<br/>
