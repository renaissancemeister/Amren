<h1>Mass Exodus From UK</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Catherine Deshayes, The Move Channel, May 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Britain is experiencing the greatest exodus of its own nationals in recent history while immigration is at unprecedented levels, new figures show.</p>
<p>In 2007, 207,000 British citizens  &mdash;  one every three minutes  &mdash;  left the country and currency specialist Foreign Currency Direct has revealed that one in four working Brits are now looking to leave the country for sunnier climes and better job opportunities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An increase in tax levelled at high wage earners coupled with rising UK unemployment is thought to be partly behind the mass exodus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With the number of unemployed in Birmingham higher than in any other major UK city, people living in the Midlands are subsequently the most likely to look for a job overseas  &mdash;  17 per cent of them compared to just 13 per cent in Wales and the South West.</p>
<p>The majority of people planned to head for a country with a warmer climate, more days of sunshine and those that were English speaking. A fifth of people named Australia as their top choice; one in six selected the USA and one in ten chose New Zealand. Canada was also a popular choice.</p>

			<p>Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States? Hate to say it, but all four of those countries are also being overrun with third world immigrants. And as the experience with Somalis shows, you can&rsquo;t just avoid the big cities to avoid third world immigrants - witness what the Somalis have done to Maine and small towns in Colorado and Tennessee. I don&rsquo;t blame ethnic Brits one bit for wanting to leave their country - given that the exorbitantly high taxes levied on them are being used to support the third world immigrants - but there are very few truly white countries left in the entire world.</p>

			<p>Fools! Take your own country back! There is no place left to run. America? No. It is as bad here and in all White nations as it is  there. We have nowhere to go, and we shouldn&rsquo;t ever have to leave our own lands that we built and our ancestors built. So why are we so afraid to stand and fight? Our Founders sure weren&rsquo;t afraid, were they? What happened to White people? They have become such wimps and cowards and so afraid to stand up for their own people.</p>

			<p>first, let me apologize for no capital letters, exclamation points or question marks. i spilled water on a part of my keyboard and short-circuited it.</p>
<p>people leaving england/britain saddens me. the first sign of breakdown was them removing the union jack from their airlines because of complaints from non-white immigrants. that demand should have been ignored.<br>
england has one of the most proud heritages of any nation on earth.<br>
i don&rsquo;t know when they relaxed their immigration laws, but the day they did was the first day of the beginning of the end of england. common sense should tell any person of english descent that letting the third world settle there would eventually spell doom. what were they thinking. not only the third world, but ethnicities who swear to kill the citizens of their adopted country. they congregate in the streets, burn effigies, carry signs, chant, and build mosques - which preach hate and teach terrorism and promote jihad. <br>
i know this sound unrealistic but it could be done if implemented right away. a british nationalist law should be passed where all non-white persons rounded up and given a one-way ticket back to their country of origin, then the passport revoked. sound draconian, huh. it could be done under the guise of protecting the economy and preservation of the union.<br>
 <br>
at this point, nothing short of this will save england.</p>

			<p>These people will tend to have come from the professional middle classes, many of whom have a history of rootlessness (in earlier times they would have been the ones staffing the outposts of the British Empire). Such people - essentially carpet-baggers - have never had particularly deep emotional ties to Britain (or, more usually, England), although they usually make patriotic noises when called for. There are also a sprinkling of the more affluent working class, who have decided to cash in (or remortgage) relatively valuable properties in Britain (again, mainly England) and move to Spain or France (largely, it has to be said, to escape the immigrants).</p>
<p>As the immigrant numbers (especially the Muslims) become even more visible and assertive than they are at present, the remaining rump of indigenous whites will be compelled to realise the gravity of the situation, and take appropriate action, either via the ballot box or, quite possibly, through civil disobedience, boycotting of immigrant-run and -owned businesses  and vigilantism. Unless the BNP makes strong electoral gains pretty soon I think that civil war is inevitable in England within the next five to ten years.</p>

			<p>The remarkable fact is not only are many White Britons leaving because they despise New Labour&rsquo;s mass non-White immigration policy, but the numbers of White Britons leaving is couterbalanced, equally and oppositely, by the inflow of non-White immigrants.<br>
 This, of course, effectively doubles the published rate of non-White immigration and ratchets up the exponential growth of the nob-White population of Britain to ever more unacceptable heights.</p>

			<p>Another classic example of &#8216;revealed preference&rsquo;: none of these Brits are moving into non-white countries, are they? <br>
That&rsquo;s because what they REALLY want, is to live in an ALL WHITE country again - and what a crime that is, according to the unelected tyrants who run the media, and tell us what to think and do&hellip;</p>
<p>The same &#8216;revealed preference&rsquo; is shown in house buying choices - it is impossible for concentrations of non whites to form in any majority white country, unless MOST whites avoid buying houses in &#8216;enriched&rsquo; areas&hellip;</p>
<p>And since we&rsquo;re supposed to live in a democracy, the wishes of the majority should prevail - and it is clearly the wish of the majority that we have our country all white again.</p>

			<p>Even with the mass immigration that the UK has experienced in recent years it is still whiter than most of the top spots on the expatriates&rsquo; potential destination lists.  I think this has more to do with the economy than race.  The UK is essentially a socialist country with very little opportunities for ambitious young people; plus the country is so crowded that it is hard for large families to find housing.  Despite Obamanomics, America is still a place where smart, ambitious people can prosper.  I am as pro-white as they come but even I have looked into moving my family to an Asian country for better economic opportunities if things get worse here or if Obama succeeds in his war on prosperity.</p>

			<p>The reporter managed to furiously avert his eyes from the obvious:  white Brits are leaving because Britain is getting less and less white.  Seeking a warmer climate has nothing to do with it.  (As proven by the popularity of Canada as a destination.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a &#8220;pry it from my cold, dead fingers&#8221; type of guy myself.  &#8220;Come and take it&#8221; works for me also.  I forget the name of the Russian pundit that stated that the US would be divided into multiple regions by the year 2010.  Although that&rsquo;s a bit early, I could see the South&rsquo;s re-secession coming to fruition at one point.  I would have passed that off for &#8220;crazy talk&#8221; a year ago.</p>

			<p>A country like Great Britain with the population still over 90% White and people still want to move to a third world garbage dump formerly known as the USA? Go figure.

<p>It is simply not that simple, Julie.  The Republicans have embraced and promoted anti-White policies as well.  The rich capitalists want cheap labor and spoiled middle-class American kids don&rsquo;t want to work hard.  Look that the Black leader of the GOP now.  Republicans are not such a pure-hearted bunch, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>

<p>Aside from Dickens and Shakespeare, the other ones were probably multi-cultis and self hating Whites.  They also sounded like Blacks when they &#8220;sang&#8221;.</p>
