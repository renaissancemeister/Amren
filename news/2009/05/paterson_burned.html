			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fredric U. Dicker, New York Post, May 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gov. Paterson, who raised state taxes by $8 billion last month, just cost state taxpayers $300,000 more.</p>
<p>The state has secretly settled an embarrassing federal racial-discrimination lawsuit, The Post has learned. The suit accused Paterson, back when he was Senate minority leader in 2003, of firing a white Senate photographer in order to replace him with an African-American.</p>
<p>The lawsuit had been scheduled to go to trial in federal court Monday in Syracuse, with Paterson, the state&rsquo;s first black governor, as a key witness. The case was settled earlier in the week, although a few glitches delayed the final deal until yesterday, legislative sources said.</p>
<p>The settlement ends a civil-rights action first filed in 2005 by Joseph Maioriello, 56, of Schenectady, a 26-year Senate employee who originally sought $1.5 million.</p>
<p>He was fired from his $34,000-a-year job as a photographer two years earlier and replaced by a black employee, El-Wise Noisette. The shakeup happened after Paterson ousted then-Sen. Martin Connor (D-Brooklyn) as the minority leader.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The settlement was initially delayed when Senate Majority Leader Malcolm Smith (D-Queens), Paterson&rsquo;s successor and a fellow African-American, refused to give his approval.</p>
<p>Smith had veto power over the settlement since the suit was filed against the Senate. He was in the awkward position of either authorizing a large payment for alleged reverse discrimination or holding out for a trial, which would have forced Paterson to testify under oath.</p>
<p>Austin Shafran, a spokesman for Smith, said he delayed the final settlement to determine if the cost &#8220;was acceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, Maioriello claimed he was told by John McPadden, then Paterson&rsquo;s chief of staff, that he was being fired because a number of minority senators wanted to replace him with &#8220;a minority photographer, a black photographer.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he was also told, &#8220;You got to remember who Sen. Paterson is. Sen. Paterson is black.&#8221;</p>

			<p>There they go, using the racist term &#8220;reverse racism&#8221; again.</p>
<p>One wonders how many white victims of discrimination actually favored such discrimination until they, personally, became victims of it.  One wonders if Mr. Maioriello now understands that ALL &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; policies have white victims.</p>

<p>Speaking as an Italian-American New Yorker I can state with an almost certainty he does.  Almost all Italian-Americans I have met in this state (males, anyway) understand that Affirmative Action policies are a zero-sum game.</p>
<p>My only criticism of Mr. Maioriello is why he chose to take a settlement instead of going to trial, which is what I would have done.  Undoubtedly that was due to bad advice from his attorney.  He had a strong case.</p>
<p>The trial would have been another major political embarrassment to our &#8220;first black governor.&#8221;  No matter.  His popularity in the polls is the lowest of any governor in memory.  I stand a better chance of being elected governor in the next election than he does.  Good riddance!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Reverse racism&#8221; or, even more nonsensical &#8220;reverse discrimination&#8221; (how can one &#8216;reverse&rsquo; discriminate?), is just more rhetoric from the left intended to distinguish discrimination against whites from discrimination against minorities.  Just like the phrase Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity.  Aren&rsquo;t the two a contradiction in terms?  Doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;equal opportunity&#8221; mean the most qualified person gets the job; or is it the most qualified person who happens to be black or latino gets the job?  </p>

<p>Not unless you are black, blacks will never, ever give up a political position without a big fight. We Whites will never get the blacks out of the white house now without a big race fight.</p>

			<p>[He said he was also told, &ldquo;You got to remember who Sen. Paterson is. Sen. Paterson is black.&rdquo;}</p>
<p>Worse than the low intelligent blacks who get elected are the stupid whites who vote for them.</p>
<p>Having blacks in any positions of power means their jurisdictions are going to degenerate, and pro-black bias will run amuck.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re obviously not from New York State.  Back in 1989 David Dinkins was elected the first black mayor of the city of New York to great fanfare.  He presided over one of the most inept administrations in the city&rsquo;s modern history.  </p>
<p>Charges of racial polarization (the Crown Heights riots &amp; black boycott of Korean-owned grocery stores), mishandling of the city&rsquo;s economy (300,000 private sector jobs were lost during his administration), and of course, his own Rangel-like inability to file an income tax return (&#8220;I haven&rsquo;t committed a crime.  What I did was fail to comply with the law.&#8221;) left a bad taste in the collective mouths of New Yorkers, who couldn&rsquo;t vote him out of office fast enough in 1993.  Neither party has even proposed a black candidate for mayor since.</p>
<p>David Paterson, our first black governor, has the lowest approval rating of any New York State governor in history (&#8220;It&rsquo;s deja vu all over again!&#8221;).  If either Rudy Giuliani or Mike Bloomberg choose to run against him, they will crush him in the polls.  Let the blacks fight all they want; only a fool bails water on a sinking ship.</p>

<p>It always seems like it is Italians who are willing to stand up for whites in this country. Everyone else sits back and lets the eggplant people (mulignan) walk all over us. </p>
<p>Same with the fire fighters who sued New York. Italian. Ditto for Sheriff Arpaio in Maricopa Co. Arizona. Same with Tom Tancredo. Same with Geraldine Ferraro who pointed out the emperor has average clothes. All Italian. </p>

			<p>I am from Albany, NY. Remember that Patterson could not have been elected dog catcher. He was appointed after Eliot Spitzer had his call-girl shenanigans exposed. </p>
<p>Thanks for the posting on Alice Green. The comments were priceless! That windbag Green has agitating in this area for 30+ years. Funny thing is that she&rsquo;s married to a white guy!</p>

			<p>One of the things I hate about our political system is that a politician or bureaucrat can do something illegal and then in the ensuing lawsuit it is always the tax payer who has to foot the bill for his malfeasance.  Paterson should have to have that $300,000 bill deducted from his bank account.</p>

			<p>No, happily I am not from New York state, but I still stand by what I said. The worm has turned and the blacks will no longer give up a political office without a big fight and the usual rants about racism if they do loose a political position. I also think Obamaster is going to appoint a black to the Supreme Circus. Whites are so afraid of being called racists (with the attendant destruction of their careers) that we won&rsquo;t do anything to stop them.</p>

			<p>This story got very little press coverage. Of course we all know, had it been a white governor who fired a black photog to make room for a white photog, he&rsquo;d have been forced to resign. We all know it   &mdash;   the US is being inexorably changed and the white race has been targeted for extinction. The saddest part of that is its by our own on the Left.</p>

			<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t get too worried about black rule because blacks can&rsquo;t rule and whites will eventually wake aup and realise that blacks = regressive policies, bankrupt ideas and stoopid decision making. Now that whites are a minority in many parts of the US attitudes will start changing too as they are increasingly on the receiving end of racism. Blacks don&rsquo;t have the political maturity needed to create real leaders. </p>

Don&rsquo;t forget the late Mayor Frank Rizzo of Philadelphia, PA who when Police Commissioner stood up to the Black Panther Party, or the late Anthony Imperiale of Newark, NJ, who organized his own private militia to protect his area from black thugs.  Let&rsquo;s also not forget Mayor Louis J. Barletta of Hazleton, PA and his ongoing fight to keep his city free of illegal aliens.</p>

<p> I can agree with all you&rsquo;ve listed but Geraldine Ferraro. She was always a strong feminist and ultra-liberal but was condemned for telling some unfortunate truths about the Obama candidacy. I hope it was a final wakeup call for her. </p>
<p>Yes, Frank Rizzo, Philadelphia&rsquo;s last great mayor should be included. Being a former cop, he knew a thing or two about criminals. From what I&rsquo;ve been told the Paisans used to be some of the toughest inmates in prison and would stand up to minority thugs. I knew a lot them that were good boxers. </p>
<p>My late uncle was born in Italy and had no use for black criminals. He was a successful engineer but was wise to the ways of the world. His whole family worked their way up from poverty to success. They never got one bit of help from &#8220;our&#8221; government and never would have accepted any if offered. They were a proud bunch, who loved opera, great food and the fine arts.   </p>
