<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30502963/">Africans Have World&rsquo;s Greatest Genetic Variation</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Randolph E. Schmid, AP, April 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Africans have more genetic variation than anyone else on Earth, according to a new study that helps narrow the location where humans first evolved, probably near the South Africa-Namibia border.</p>
<p>The largest study of African genetics ever undertaken also found that nearly three-fourths of African-Americans can trace their ancestry to West Africa. The new analysis published Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the fact that modern humans arose in Africa, they have had time to accumulate dramatic changes&#8221; in their genes, explained lead researcher Sarah Tishkoff, a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>People have been adapting to very diverse environmental niches in Africa, she explained in a briefing.</p>
<p>Over 10 years, Tishkoff and an international team of researchers trekked across Africa collecting samples to compare the genes of various peoples. Often working in primitive conditions, the researchers sometimes had to resort to using a car battery to power their equipment, Tishkoff explained.</p>
<p>The reason for their work? Very little was known about the genetic variation in Africans, knowledge that is vital to understanding why diseases have a greater impact in some groups than others and in designing ways to counter those illnesses.</p>
<p>Scott M. Williams of Vanderbilt University noted that constructing patterns of disease variations can help determine which genes predispose a group to a particular illness.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody&rsquo;s history is part of African history because everybody came out of Africa,&#8221; Ibrahim [Muntaser Ibrahim of the department of molecular biology at the University of Khartoum, Sudan] said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Overall, the researchers were able to study and compare the genetics of 121 African groups, 60 non-African populations and four African-American groups.</p>
<p>The so-called &#8220;Cape-colored&#8221; population of South Africa has highest levels of mixed ancestry on the globe, a blend of African, European, East Asian and South Indian, Tishkoff said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study also found that about 71 percent of African-Americans can trace their ancestry to western African origins. They also have between 13 percent and 15 percent European ancestry and a smaller amount of other African origins. There was &#8220;very little&#8221; evidence for American Indian genes among African-Americans, Tishkoff said.</p>
<p>Ehret added that only about 20 percent of the Africans brought to North America made the trip directly, while most of the rest went first to the West Indies.</p>
<p>And, he added, some local African-American populations, such as the residents of the sea islands off Georgia and South Carolina, can trace their origins to specific regions such as Sierra Leone and Guinea.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>White slaveowners raping black slaves is often cited as the reason for this, but I think a more accurate explanation is that the Union Army occupying the South after the WBTS were well-paid and a long distance from their women, while formerly enslaved black women with no prospects, few skills and no money were in the same area.  Occupying soldiers from a rich country and poor indigenous women?  Put the two together and you can figure out what inevitably happens.</p>

<p>I think a more likely explanation is that mulattos have been marrying blacks for centuries, thereby increasing the percentage of white genes in the black population.  I would be curious to know the percentage of black genes in the American white population though.</p>

			<p>I cannot see what the Cape Coloured have to do in a study like that, except if its purpose was to extol the joys of diversity.<br>
The praise for genetic variability as &#8220;adaptivity&#8221; is a dead giveaway.<br>
Technically, it means LESS selection pressure from without, not more as insinuated in the article. Intraspecific selection (i.e. you do not have to fight Nature, only your neighbour) can yield some interesting results (say, birds of paradise) but usually it is an evolutionary dead end.<br>
When our ancestors left Africa 100,000 years ago (kind of a prehistoric White flight?), as countless waves had done before them, the winters of Niflheimen (lit.: &#8220;Home of the Fog&#8221;,north) gradually, over untold hundreds of generations, burned the incompetent, the antisocial and the ugly out of their gene pool - they simply died from cold, hunger and scurvy.<br>
- Those left behind were spared that genocide (or what did you think evolution is?).</p>
<p>The problem the Lefties have is that Leonard Jeffries is right - though not exactly as he meant it:<br>
We ARE the Ice People :)</p>

			<p>Steve Sailer has talked about the black admixture in whites:</p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/sailer/strom.htm</p>
<p>&#8220;And the average black admixture among whites is only 0.7 percent. That&rsquo;s the equivalent of having among your 128 great etc. grandparents, 127 whites and one black. It appears that 70 percent of whites have no African ancestors at all. Among the 30 percent who do, the black admixture is around 2.3 percent, which would be like having three black ancestors out of those 128.&#8221;</p>

			<p>That 15 percent White admixture number is thrown around quite a bit, but it seems many people misinterpret that to mean that all Blacks have 15 percent White ancestry; this is not true. That number is just an average. Some American Blacks have zero percent White ancestry while others may have as high as eighty percent. People seem to forget this fact and dream up all kinds of theories about why Blacks have White ancestry when the answer is much simpler - it&rsquo;s just an average.</p>

			<p>We need another name for the birthplace of human evolution. Africa is a name loaded with negative connotations in the modern world. The word Africa originated either with the Greeks or Romans (I forget which) and no one knows where the word came from. Before then, people living there would not have known themselves as being African. I feel insulted when people say my ancestors evolved in Africa. They did not. They evolved in the  territory now known as Africa, but they would have little in common with the people now living there.</p>

			<p>Slaves for the Trans-Atlantic slave trade were initially sourced in Senegambia and the Windward Coast. Around 1650 the trade moved to west-central Africa (the Kingdom of the Kongo and neighboring Angola). The transport of slaves from Africa to the Americas forms the middle passage of the triangular trade. Several distinct regions can be identified along the west African coast, these are distinguished by the particular European countries who visited the slave ports, the peoples who were enslaved, and the dominant African society(s) who provided the slaves. Researchers discovered the genetic DNA of The San people was more diverse than any other group, suggesting they have survived longer than any other group. The first humans evolved in southern Africa, probably near the South Africa-Namibia border, and today the continent has more genetic variation than anywhere else on Earth.</p>

<i>&#8220;&hellip;over untold hundreds of generations, burned the incompetent, the antisocial, and the ugly out of their gene pool&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This nicely ties into something I&rsquo;ve thought for years.</p>
<p>Blacks complain that the criminal justice system doesn&rsquo;t work for them because it&rsquo;s based on a white belief system. They claim it was created by whites for whites and simply can&rsquo;t work for blacks. They also note that Africans never created such a system.</p>
<p>This, in a sense, may be true.</p>
<p>Whites have long known that there are bad white people. As such, they created a system of laws and justice to weed out miscreants and remove them from their communities so as to keep communities safe from such bad influences. Since a great deal of violent criminality happens during the same age period as the height of sexual reproduction, locking away violent white criminals during their reproductive years would have resulted in breeding of fewer criminals.</p>
<p>Blacks like to say that too many black men are in jail. I believe just the opposite. Not enough black men are in jail. </p>
<p>Blacks have never had this weeding of criminals from their genetic pool which is why I believe violent black youth are vastly over represented in the criminal justice system where ever such a system is in place.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Africans have more genetic variation than anyone else on Earth,&#8221;</p>
<p>SO?????</p>
<p>It may be true that humans evolved in Africa.  There is much evidence to prove that the first modern humans evolved in S. Asia around 800 thousand years ago instead of AFrica.</p>
<p>Humans may have evolved in Africa first.  But I believe nothing about race but what I see and experience.</p>
<p>Back in the early 20th century black supremecists and their white allies had the theory that Whites evolved first and were the most primitive of all humans.</p>
<p>The idea was that animals and have White skin because they are covered with fur and hair.  Thus the earliest and most primitive of humans had White skin like animals.</p>
<p>Black and tan people evolved later.  They were not covered with hair so their skin became dark.</p>
<p>That theory may be right, it may be wrong.  But it is no more valid than the current one that blacks are in some way superior because mankind evolved in Africa.</p>

<p>No, no, Cassiodorus.  You&rsquo;ve got it all wrong.  Race is only a genetic reality when it reflects favorably on blacks and the dogma of diversity.  Otherwise, it&rsquo;s only a &#8220;social construct&#8221;.  Also, we&rsquo;re not talking about &#8220;race&#8221; here.  Not at all.  Here, we&rsquo;re only speaking of &#8220;population groups&#8221; specific to geographical areas.</p>

			<p>The out of Africa theory is flawed.<br>
This is how Africans were formed<br>
<a href="https://erectuswalksamongst.us/Chap26.html" rel="nofollow">https://erectuswalksamongst.us/Chap26.html</a><br>
Africans have the greatest diversity as they have the collective genes of waves of Eurasian invaders. Besides a large part of the non African population died out during the Toba supervolvano eruption in Indonesia causing a bottle neck and loss of genetic variability among Eurasians<br>

Political and social theories of human equality are ideas invented by western peoples very used to dominating and being dominated by other ethnic groups, some the same race and some not the same race. </p>
<p>DNA and genetic analyses and ancestral lineage research is the best of current scientific information available on human races and genetic similarities. </p>
<p>The National Geographic &#8216;Genographic Project&rsquo; has a narrative cultural chronology of human relatedness on their website,</p>
<p>and provides a way you can know your own genetic lineages, by <br>
submitting your DNA for analysis, (Y and X). It will open a huge area of information to you, about biology, evolution and political geography. Hope you check it out at:</p>

			<p>Most apologists for West African black incareration, poverty, and anti-intellectualism point to overt or hidden discrimination and racism as the cause.<br>
     It has long been my hypothesis that it is geographical. Modern civilizationas arose simultaneously in the Yangtze, Indus, Nile, and Tigres &amp; Euphrates River valleys about 6500 years ago. Cultural diffusion commenced among all three. Egyptians traded down the east Coast of Africa all the way to Zanzibar. The war horse driven chariot was invented 4000 years ago in China and a scant 500 years later appeared in the Arabian Pennisula. People have been trading goods and dna for 40 centuries from Hong Kong to Mogadishu; however west Africa never had cultural contact with other civilizations until Arab caraavans in the 14th century crossed the Sahara trading salt and Portugeze explorers in the 16th looking for a quick route to the Spice Islands.<br>
     This was caused by the jungles of Central Africa and the fact that until the Arab invention of the Lateen sail, easterly winds blowing off the Sahara made sailing south from Gibralter almost impossible. East Africans, Caucasions, Mongolians, and Semites have relatively the same IQs and crime rates. This is because no matter how much we may find the idea diconcerting, we share the same values toward education and morality.<br>
     West Africans are mostly neolithic in out look. It is like an entire population of folks fell into an ice crevasse during the last ice age and were melted out last Friday.  Think what kind of person you would be if your family values that had been passed down for 50 centuries contained no Confucion, Bhuddist, Pharonic, Hindu, Summerian,Cannanite, Greek, Roman, Hittite, Persian,Mongolian,Moorish, Anglo-Saxon, or Celtic and Germanic, mores, folkways, and taboos.<br>
     It is frightenly simple. The farther your forebarers arose from the East Coast of Africa south of the Sahara, the more primitive, atavistic, and aggressive you will behave at least for another 2 thousand years. <br>

			<p>No kangaroos,<br>
The  first humans left  Africa not 100,000 years ago but ~50,000 years  ago. Some of the  first  groups  went almost  due  East to Arabia, Southern India, New  Guinea, Australia, Tasmania, etc.</p>
<p>A later  group travelled  a  bit  more  to  the  North to settle in Eurasia. And migrations into  what  is  now Europe took place  only some 40,000 years  ago.</p>
<p>For those  who  believe  that  there  were more  selctive  pressures in cold Eurasia  than  tropical and  sub-tropical Africa  should  note  that  the  Neanderthal  humans  were  in Europe for  more than 300,000 years but were certainly not more  cognitively able than the incoming African migrants  &mdash;  despite  having larger  crania. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s often cited as an historical justification for today&rsquo;s outrageous number of sexual assaults against white women by Black males as though every black rapist were thinking about a possible ancestor of his who was raped by the Massa. IF that is the motivation then I think that 30,000 interracial rapes of white women over the last 40-50 years have more than &#8220;evened the score&#8221;.<br>
 Why is there always an excuse, that dare not be challenged, for every black pathology?<br>
Why aren&rsquo;t Jews in this country roaming in bands and assaulting everyone with a German surname? Why aren&rsquo;t Armenian Americans waging a Guerilla war against Americans of Turkish descent. Why aren&rsquo;t Chinese, Filipino and Korean Americans assaulting Japanese Americans.</p>
<p> What&rsquo;s the excuse for the horrendous number of rapes that occur each day in almost every African country. European colonialism?</p>

			<p>I for one am not completely convinced that all mankind started in Africa.  There are some Chinese findings that may suggest that all the races originated in different places.<br>
However for the sake of argument let&rsquo;s say that the first argument is true. It&rsquo;s then apparent that the most intelligent and curious migrated out of the continent in search of something better or fled because they couldn&rsquo;t tolerate the predations of the least intelligent and most barberous.  The primitives who had no vision stayed behind where they&rsquo;ve advanced little since those days 100,000 years ago.</p>

			<p>OCCAM,<br>
what are a few tens of thousands of years when you regard anything younger than 10,000 as &#8220;recent&#8221;? Human evolution is not my forte :) Besides, the density of human fossils in time and space should dicourage one from getting apodictic.<br>
I just tried a slightly humorous evolutionary biologist interpretation. Grossly simplified: I hold that Europe selected for the intelligent and cooperative and Africa for the violent and oversexed. (and all our current problems accrue from that; well, not all) That idea of course is at least as old as Darwin himself.</p>
<p>- Sbuffalonative´s idea that it is the judicial system that makes the difference has some merit. H.K.Erben (paleontologist) holds that a &#8220;code of conduct&#8221; remarkably similar to the Ten Commandments must have been present already at the Australopithecus stage, otherwise society could not have evolved. I think he is overdoing it a little here. There ARE cultural influences, but I´d say they´re superficial. (our own women treating us as eunuchs and going after the ferals is such a recent problem, resulting from both culture and diversity)<br>
Otto Koenig, whom I had the honour of hearing, put it this way: We have in us 10,000 generations of paleolithic - and 200 since then; what did you expect?</p>
<p>However, what I meant was the evolution of the Europids was extraspecific (adaptive, but with genetic constriction), while that of the Negrids was intraspecific. Through civilization, we have eliminated extraspecific selection pressure. As a result, all kinds of undesirables thrive. Eugenics Now!<br>

			<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s the excuse for the horrendous number of rapes that occur each day in almost every African country.&#8221;</p>
<p>What rapes? Outside of SAfrica? Africans in africa living with extreme poverty, for the most part are warm, giving, sharing and peacable. It is only with integration that all hope is lost for Africans. And all hope is lost for their &#8216;benefactors&rsquo; too, for that matter. </p>

			<p>I suspect the reason for Africa&rsquo;s great genetic diversity is the fact that it is large - twice the land area of South America - that humans have been there the longest, and that until relatively recent history the population lived in small, isolated settlements (genetic drift always works the fastest in isolated communities.)</p>
<p>Take a look at a map and compare Africa with Europe.  Europe has a very convoluted shoreline with major islands offshore, so people would have naturally taken to the water.  Africa&rsquo;s only major offshore island is Madagascar, and that was originally settled by Malays, not Africans.  Even most of Africa&rsquo;s rivers are not very navigable, as most of Africa consists of a plateau, so the rivers tend to have waterfalls not too far from the coast.  Under primitive conditions even the Zambezi and Congo would have been as much a hindrance as a benefit to traffic; they&rsquo;re full of dangerous wildlife, thus are nothing much like the Rhine, Danube, Volga or Don rivers in Europe.</p>

With all these mixtures and diversity, in theory, and I do stress THEORY, blacks should be at the top of the food chain (unless, of course, the THEORY that diversity is an advantage is wrong).</p>

<p>By way of self correction, that 30,000 figure is a yearly average; not a total over several decades.<br>

			<p>Reply to Taurus 689:</p>
<p>That was a good post. The truth is blacks would have very high crime rates, including rape, even if there had never been any slavery. They are actually just engaging in rationalization and self-deception. Note the very high black crime rate in other countries with very different histories from the United States, e.g. Great Britain, France, Canada etc.</p>

<p>Well said and very true. It is remarkable how little sub-Saharan Africa has developed over the millennias. It was never part of any great empire or civilization. No significant inventions or scientific discoveries were made there. Black Africans did not build ships to sail the great seas like the Vikings or the Chinese. Almost everything in sub-Saharan Africa today that is &#8216;modern&rsquo; (but now decaying), was built by European colonialists, roads, railways, bridges, etc. No great religion, philosophy or culture had its origins there. Had it not been for Arab and White contact sub-Saharan Africa would probably be just like it was a 1,000 years ago and would return to that level if the world left the continent alone. Undoubtedly this lack of social, cultural and technological progress can only be posited on the low levels of intelligence of the populations residing there. </p>

<p>No, it was over 30,000 raped in just the year 2005.  Over 40 - 50 years who knows what the number is, could be millions.</p>

			<p>During the historic era of white rule in African nations, an era that gave these nations the first glimpse of civilized society, it was considered by blacks, an honor to give their daughters to whites, it was very much a status symbol among blacks to have a daughter who was a concubine for a white landowner or businessman, in some African nations this is still practiced, but very much concealed by governments and liberal media.</p>

			<p>I read a Scientific American article in the early 90s that stated American blacks are losing 5% of their unique African genes every generation they stay in the US.  Genetic variation is greater in African mainly because for 200,000 years Africans have had to deal with coevolving diseases; microbes that the rest of the continents don&rsquo;t burden the human race with.  Africa is the the place humans have benn longest and even today have smallest populations because the other life forms there have had more time to learn how to deal with them.  Africans have the shortest average life spans on the planet now and without Western medicine and food shipments their populations would crash.</p>

			<p>It  seems  as if  most of the  posters  above  pay no  attention at all to the  findings of  scientific research. Of course, scientific findings can  be problematic or wrong sometimes but you have to show  &mdash;  also  by the  empirical methods of science  &mdash;  that whatever  theory is  wrong. But  you don&rsquo;t do  it  by dogmatically clinging  to a  position  &mdash;  because you happen to  like  it.</p>
<p>Facts: humanity lived  exclusively  in Africa  for 75% at least  of  humanity&rsquo;s life  span. It&rsquo;s only  relatively recently  that humans migrated out  of  Africa  &mdash;  after  having migrated  to its  4  corners. Humans migrated  not only to West Asia then Europe but also  to India, Andaman Islands, Fiji, New  Guinea, Australia and  Tasmania  &mdash;  BEFORE  they  ever set  foot  in Europe.</p>
<p>The  key  African haplogroup of  E3b  &mdash;  and  others too  &mdash;  are  present  not only  in Africa  but also  in Europe  &mdash;  Greece especially.</p>
<p>Humanity  became humanity  because it was  able  to  develop  human  languages, creatively use stone then  metal tools, use fire, invent  clothing, etc. All these crucial  steps  took place  in Africa.</p>
<p>If one  goes  strictly  on phenotype  then  Africans were  the  first  to build  in stone, use  writing, domesticate animals, use  agriculture(the  African Natufians in the  Levant).</p>
<p>And  those  who don&rsquo;t  keep  up  with  archaelogical  findings  should  note  that part of  Egypt and Kush(Nubia) are both in the  Sahara and so-called  &#8220;sub-Sahara&#8221; Africa. </p>
<p>And  those  who have  the  time  should  research  on the African history as  written by serious  historians.</p>

			<p>Humanity began in Africa as well as Civilization.</p>
<p>That said, European ancestors also originated from Africa and mixed with the local Neanderthal population (who were more primitive than the human evolving in Africa at the same time).  You will find that the straight black hair, pale underskin, and certain bone structure are derived from these Neanderthals.</p>
<p>It is a matter of archeological fact that earliest vestiges of modern Civilization began deep in Africa and migrated down the Nile (that&rsquo;s north with those unfamiliar with the Egyptian paradigm) eventual producing the jewel that was Ancient Egypt.  Ancient Egypt then provided the template of (urban) Civilization that would be copied throughout Asia Minor, Europe, and the World.</p>
<p>Africa&rsquo;s incredible genetic diversity is a result of the nearly 200,000+ years of mutation and variation in the genome, variations that would eventually produce the &#8220;other races&#8221; of humanity.</p>

Interesting comments&hellip;. but I wonder if this is so much a genetic thing or more of a combination of genes and conditions?  A Princeton Psychologist wrote a book several decades ago that has been at the forefront of explorations into the origin of consciousness and he lectured for the remainder of his life at many locations for the rest of his life.  Today, there is still a Julian Jaynes Soceity that still serves as a forum for further exploration on the ideas he proposed regarding how human beings developed their unique consciousness.  That book is titled, &#8220;The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind.&#8221;  Not a lightweight book.  </p>
<p>Among those ideas is one that I think I agree with;  Consciousness is learned by every new generation.  This would mean that although we might inherit the capability for intelligence and with it a broader and expanding capacity for conscious thought - self - conscious thought, every new generation must learn and is therefore limited by their culture as well as their genetically inherited capacity for consciousness.  Where the transitory frontiers may be is up for discussion, but I think I agree that consciousness is learned from birth on.  This is why I think it is clear that we are actually (the human race) going backwards in our level of consciousness.<br>

<p>Every bit of this contention is utterly false. Civilization began in the Near East and filtered west to Egypt. Sub-saharan Africa had nothing whatsoever to do with it. It&rsquo;s remarkable that people continue to question so basic and established a fact.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blackamoor&#8221; is a much later coinage than &#8220;moor,&#8221; the original meaning of which is merely a native of Maure, now Algeria and Morocco. The term had no distinct racial significance in the ancient world, which lacked modern racial and ethnic terminology, but was applied generally to Arabs, Berbers and (later) north African muslims generally.</p>

			<p>What domesticated animals were these, Black Emperor?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the common domesticated animals of the world.</p>
<p>1.  Dogs.  These were bred from wolves in Asia.<br>
2.  Chickens.  These were originally native to what is now Vietnam, and were first domesticated there.<br>
3.  Pigs.  Domesticated separately in Euope and China.<br>
4.  Horses.  Originally native to the Central Asian steppe, and domesticated there by nomadic people.<br>
5.  Cattle.  Ditto.<br>
6.  Goats and sheep.  Originally native to the Middle East, and first domesticated there.<br>
7.  Cats.  First domesticated by Arabs in ancient Egypt.<br>
8.  Ducks and geese.  Europe and China again.<br>
9.  Turkeys.  Amerinds.<br>
10.  Llamas and alpacas.  Ditto.<br>
11.  Camels.  Native to the Middle East, and domesticated there by Arabs.<br>
12.  Dromedaries.  Native to west China, and domesticated there.</p>
<p>How many of the large, strong sub-Saharan African animals were domesticated by blacks?  Absolutely none.  Some of those ruminants would probably make decent beasts of burden, but they were exploited only as game animals.  Even elephants, domesticated in India were ignored as draft animals by African blacks.  Civilization moved UP the Nile, from the north, rather than the other way, and the dividing line between Arab north Africa and black Africa is still pretty much at the seventh cataract, south of which the ancient Egyptions couldn&rsquo;t sail their ships (the prevailing wind blows from the north, so they&rsquo;d sail against the current, and for the return trip, they&rsquo;d simply drift downstream.)</p>
<p>Civilization had several separate origins - the Middle East (what is now Iraq), India, China, and Mesoamerica (what is now Mexico), but none of these places are in sub-Saharan Africa.  If, as you claim black Africa produced great civilizations, where did they go?  Keep in mind that it is impossible to &#8220;steal&#8221; knowledge from someone in such a way that they no longer possess it.  The old Zimbabwean ruins look very much like similar structures in India, so the safest bet is that they were built by Indian traders.  Even Timbuktu was built as a slaving outpost to supply labor to the Arab north, and civilization there was built as a frank imitation of what Arabs and Berbers had already created.</p>
<p>What about sea travel?  Africans built no seagoing ships; even Madagascar was originally settled by Malays - blacks being brought there in numbers only later as slaves.  Did ancient black Africans create a written language, a system of mathematics or a calendar?  No.  The ancient Greeks on the other hand knew not only that the earth was round, but actually calculated pretty accurately how big it was.</p>
