<h1>SPLC Advising Local Hispanic Group</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Clemons, The Reporter (Albertville, Alabama), May 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A civil rights group is working with local Hispanic residents who want bilingual signs for Albertville businesses.</p>
<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center is &#8220;serving in an advisory capacity&#8221; to La Voz de la Comunidad, according to Jose Cardenas.</p>
<p>Cardenas is an outreach paralegal for SPLC&rsquo;s Immigrant Justice Project. He released the statement Thursday that said members of the group  &mdash;  whose name translates to the Voice of the Community  &mdash;  want businesses in Albertville to put Spanish on their English-language signs.</p>
<p>The proposal answers Mayor Lindsey Lyons&rsquo; plan to require English translations on Spanish signs. The mayor cited &#8220;public safety&#8221; issues in the plan he suggested when he was running for City Council last year.</p>
<p>The Montgomery-based SPLC monitors what it calls &#8220;hate groups&#8221; and works to teach tolerance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Albertville is mentioned for the 2006 shootings of windows in businesses owned by Mexican or Guatemalan immigrants. Police at the time said the shootings may not have been related to race because a senior center bus and a business not related to Hispanics were victims of similar crimes.</p>
<p>SPLC did not list any hate groups in Marshall County on its list of such things for the state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Aylene Sepulveda, who attends Albertville City Council meetings as much as anybody, is a member of La Voz. She said SPLC is acting as attorneys for La Voz.</p>
<p>Sepulveda said she reached out to SPLC, not the other way around.</p>
<p>She admitted to me Monday that she doesn&rsquo;t expect the requirement of Spanish on English signs to pass.</p>
<p>Sepulveda said she just wants more understanding for Albertville&rsquo;s Hispanic residents.</p>

								<h2><a href="https://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/albertvilles_mayor_wants_busin.html">Albertville&rsquo;s Mayor Wants Business Signs Now in Spanish to Include English Translations</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>AP, May 5, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The mayor of Albertville, Alabama, wants to require all local businesses with signs in Spanish to include English, saying it is a matter of public safety. </p>
<p>Mayor Lindsey Lyons, whose proposal to amend the city&rsquo;s sign laws has been questioned by some Hispanics, said Monday it could take longer for officers who don&rsquo;t read Spanish to answer a 911 call at a business if the sign is in Spanish. He said many of the businesses downtown are Hispanic and have such signs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If the city adopts the mayor&rsquo;s proposal, Sepulveda [Aylene Sepulveda, a leader of a newly formed Hispanic group] said, the city should also require all English signs to include Spanish translations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lyons called Sepulveda&rsquo;s suggestion to make all signs in both English and Spanish &#8220;ludicrous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does she mean we&rsquo;re living in Mexico?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;This is not Mexico or any other Latin American country. It&rsquo;s the United States of America the last time I looked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Albertville, a town of some 20,000 that is about 20 percent Hispanic, has 52 registered businesses operated by Hispanics, Sepulveda said. She said many of them could be hurt if relations between city government and the Hispanic community does not improve.</p>

			<p>This stuff is so outrageous that a class action lawsuit should be filed against the SPLC for aiding and abetting illegal immigration, as is prescribed in Title 8, Section 1325 of the United States Immigration Law Code. This nation is turning into a free for all, where the law is concerned.</p>

			<p>A few months ago, the Poverty Palace announced it it was going all immigration, all the time.  Fine by me, let&rsquo;s see the SPLC collect the donations that it is currently when America becomes Aztlan.  Doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that Dees and Co. take in many Mexican pesos.</p>

			<p>There is NO group that is a greater danger to the peaceful co-existence of the races in America than the SPLC.</p>
<p>And there is NO group in this country that fabricates so much under the guise of love and tolerance as the SPLC.</p>
<p>Their anti-white agenda is a Cultural Marxist one, with a lot of it based in outright communism.</p>
<p>I was hoping the collapse of the economy would dry up their funding, but one of their largest donors, George Soros, actually earned a billion dollars last year manipulating currencies, as he always does.</p>
<p>Before he creates another debacle jeopardizing the economic soundness of a country&rsquo;s currency, nations would be wise to pass laws against what he does.</p>
<p>Until his funding dries up or he passes (He&rsquo;s 78), he will continue to fund the SPLC, the ADL, Move On.org and the Daily Kos, plus other hate AMerica organizations.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Sepulveda said she just wants more understanding for Albertville&rsquo;s Hispanic residents.&#8221;</p>
<p>And less understanding for Albertville&rsquo;s American residents, presumably&hellip; (that&rsquo;s if there are any left.)</p>
<p>America will soon be a third world country. Third world people = third world country. What else could cause a country to be a third world country? Magical properties of different land masses?</p>

			<p>Bilingual signs&hellip;. so then where do we stop?  Why are we favoring Spanish when we have many more language groups living within US borders?  I can just immagine the eye clutter.  This is why nations should have official languages.  If you want to live somewhere, learn the language.  Doing that will teach you about the region&rsquo;s culture too.  I did that when I lived and worked in Slovenia and I expected it.</p>

			<p>As usual, &#8220;understanding&#8221; means &#8220;utter capitulation to the demands, culture and folkways of primitive aliens.&#8221; Will the SPLC explain to these mestizos that in America kidnapping, urinating in the front yard and sexual advances upon underage girls are considered antisocial? That would be a genuine example of &#8220;understanding.&#8221; Will Sepulveda and Cardenas explain to their amigos the importance of being sober while driving a car, and that having liability insurance is not only a legal requirement, but a sensible and fair thing to do? That would help everyone get along. But it is always white Americans who have to accommodate others, never the other way around. </p>

			<p>some questions..does the splc building have its name in spanish on its building? does morris dees, and cohen, and mark potok live in all white neighborhoods?..does any real americans know where dees, potok, and cohen live? is the splc building left unguarded at night? should race traitors like morris dees be allowed to live among the people he is destroying? should services delivered to him by white employees of the water, sewer, power, electric, policeman, and hospitals be eliminated? does he drive to work? how about his wife? does his children play with white kids? does he deserve to live in this country? can a group of citizens call him on these things? can he be sued by 25000 different people? can demonstrators surround his building and block commerce? can they surround his house 24 hours a day?  just questions for thought. </p>

<p>Slight correction, cultural ethnic one.  There was a recent article in Vanity Fair that mentioned SPLC.  It seems that many of Bernie Madoff&rsquo;s investors and victims were big SPLC givers.  Now that that money is gone, SPLC donations are way down.</p>
<p>Memo to FBI monitors.  You finally figured out that those so called neo nazi skinhead groups were SPLC front groups.  Why don&rsquo;t you investigate SPLC and Tim Wise for hate thought?</p>

			<p>Soros and Foxman are the biggest arguments against any immigration at all.  Both came here after WW2 when their beloved marxist Russians conquered their native lands, Hungary and Lithuania.  They should have stayed their and joined the Soviet prison service instead of coming here to destroy the country.</p>

			<p>Maybe the SPLC can teach the local hispanics that people don&rsquo;t like competitors.  They don&rsquo;t like it when people steal jobs, commit identity theft, send remittances home rather than spending the money locally, and sending their children to local schools that they did not pay for. I will be holding my breath.</p>

			<p>Since the European Union now allows the free movement and residency of all European countries within any country in the Union by all its citizens, almost a million expatriot British citizens (mostlt retirees) have settled in Spain to escape from not only the dismal weather in Britain but the high prices, and over-crowding there due to indiscriminate massive immigration in recent decades.</p>
<p>Many of the new Brit expats have opened bars and small restaurants and placed on signs outside and on printed menues what is offered, but far too many have until recently only used English for such information.  Local Spanish uthorities are insisting that although the bars may mainly cater for Brits, as they are in Spain, they must also be available for the Spanish and licences to trade will be refused if this anomoly is not corrected and quite rightly too.  </p>
<p>Far too mnay expats come to Spain and make no attempt to learn Spanish which is worse than the Hispanics in the USA not learning English as the Brits can legally move here, but road signs, etc. here are all still in Spanish although most are graphically easy to understand, but a very few name ones here on the Costa del Sol are also in Arabic for those tourist visitors from nearby North Africa.   But the old saying when in Rome&hellip;. must apply.  So it could be suggested that the only signs needed in Spanish in te sourthern states are the ones to help Spanish speaking tourists and especially perhaps ones showing directions back to Mexico?</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been familiar with Albertville, AL., and the general Marshall County area for twenty years. As is so often the case, it&rsquo;s a d@mn chicken processing plant that brought in the illegals. </p>
<p>Knowing the natives of the &#8220;Sand Mountain&#8221; area, I don&rsquo;t doubt windows were shot out of Mexican businesses. But that Albertville is now 20% hispanic just goes to show who has the power.  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m just guessing here, but I suspect the last thing bringing in the SPLC will do is create &#8220;understanding&#8221;, unless that word has been redefined to mean &#8220;indimidation via threats of litigation&#8221;.</p>

<p>Ranger, While some of the style of these groups recalls some of Karl Marx&rsquo;s ideas, to say the above just reveals mis-information.  Communism is anti-fascist and there is more of that in our present Western form of cultural socialism.  So much so that the name almost does not fit.  The new terms ought to be Multiculturalism and Disceptive Diversity.  Have you ever actually read Das Kapital or The Communist Manifesto?  Most of the greatest anti-communists have never read either, but taken their attitudes from other mis-informed, politically driven demigogs like Joseph McCarthy.  </p>
<p>I know that this will attract accusations of being a communist sympathizer but I am no more that than a capitalist sympathizer.  I hope for something in between that focuses on a racial national feeling that also sees the wisdom of bringing along as many of our own kind as possible through a government that supports our kind, rich and poor.  I have seen this work abroad and have written about it before.  But I just don&rsquo;t know if the American mindset can comprehend such a thing.  If it cannot, then my opinion is that we are truly doomed.</p>

			<p>W&rsquo;Plight:</p>
<p>I could knitpick all day about your particular viewpoint here, but AR&rsquo;s servers only have so much disk space, and I have a life beyond posting at AR.  I would implore you not to mix up Joe McCarthy with most of the rest of the anti-Communist movement of the day.  I agree with you that most anti-Communists had less than pure, less than bona fide and ulterior motives.  (See:  Richard Nixon, and others.)  But as the mainstream media then and today treated the anti-Communism of Richard Nixon and other with curiousity, they absolutely rip into McCarthy.  Why?</p>
<p>I think McCarthy&rsquo;s anti-Communism was different.  His was with the spirit of populism, opposition to the incumbent elites and their goals.  Unlike most a-Cs of the day, he didn&rsquo;t and never bashed labor unions.  He was on the precpice of linking the communism of the USSR with American elites, both in and out of government.  It is that very same elite which in the years after they assassinated McCarthy, both figuratively and literally, that they would start demanding the end of the segregated South and of &#8220;national origin&#8221; immigration restrictions.</p>
<p>But for most a-Cs, that called themselves &#8220;conservative&#8221; and &#8220;liberal,&#8221; their &#8220;anti-Communisms&#8221; were merely fronts for letting big corporations doing whatever the hell they wanted (in the case of &#8220;conservative&#8221; anti-Communists) or worldwide Keynesian economic schemes (LBJ&rsquo;s &#8220;TVA on the Mekong.&#8221;)</p>

			<p>The agenda of SPLC is the same as ADL, ACLU and other anti-Christian, anti-White-European culture organizations.  It&rsquo;s the old divide and conquer technique used by Marxist&rsquo;s since 1850.</p>

			<p>Whiteplight needs to examine history. In the end, as shown by the facts, the &#8220;demagogue&#8221; Senator McCarthy has turned out to be correct. The people he was after in DC, Hollywood and other places now run the US, never mind the SPLC. Look around. Also, having actually read DK and the CM among other collections of verbose reasoning dedicated to actually rationalizing one group&rsquo;s rule over all others, it would seem that most of the so-called misinformed commie bashers you slight actually have it right. The only reason the &#8220;Marxists&#8221; push this garbage is because they believe it&rsquo;s ok as long as they are in charge, which means they can live like kings while everyone else lives like a third world peasant, lives to serve those running the show, to put it in simple terms. The SPLC is nothing more than an anti-white, pro-Marxist hate group. It is anti-white because the people running this racist organization see whites as the only threat to the full control they dream of. They see non-whites as the perfect slaves for their marxist utopia, unable to ever mount a serious rebellion. </p>

			<p>Follow your own advice 1:42AM May 10, you are so positively correct about Marxism, whether it be small examples, or large ones, like the Soviet Union, etc. None of the people who benefitted from the Marxist doctrine, believed in it, in any sincere way. Also,of course Mr.McCarthy was right. We know today, from all kinds of new information that has popped up from that era, that he was 100 percent correct in his charges. When it comes to a specific example of the innanity of Marxist clowns, I always love to cite Fidel Castro and his goons. It is so funny how they have walked around their whole lives wearing those fatigues in public, and yet living in magnificient villas, and wearing expensive suits in private life. </p>

			<p>What&rsquo;s there to not understand about these illegal hispanics and their &#8216;leaders&rsquo;?  They don&rsquo;t respect our laws, they run our institutions into the ground, they don&rsquo;t respect our culture, they bring in gang violence, kidnapping, child molesting, drunk driving, and they can&rsquo;t speak our language nor do they even care to.  There&rsquo;s nothing more to &#8216;understand&rsquo; about their culture.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m making reference to &#8220;some&#8221; communism. How did you arrive at anything else?</p>
<p>In fact the Frankfort School bunch converted Marxism from economic to cultural terms, making deviations along the way, but many concepts and policies are unequivocally based in communism.  </p>
<p>I think you automatically drew the conclusion that I&rsquo;m ignorant of communism and Marx&rsquo;s writings and am the type who screams accusation of communism without knowing anything about it.</p>
<p>Not so.  </p>
<p>And, your &#8220;Deceptive Diversity,&#8221;  describes nothing but Cultural Marxism, but just a part of it.</p>
<p>What I wrote was absolutely right on.  Like the conversion of Ak47 semi-automatics from semi-automatic fire to fully automatic, I think you jump into the fray without having the necessary basic knowledge to counter effectively the points you don&rsquo;t agree with.</p>
<p>I would reccommend that you read William Lind&rsquo;s essays on the Frankfort School.  They&rsquo;re on the internet.  </p>
