<h1><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D984QGDO0&amp;show_article=1">Surgeon General Novello Pleads Not Guilty in NY</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Valerie Bauman, AP, May 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former Surgeon General Antonia Novello pleaded not guilty Tuesday to forcing state employees to work overtime to handle her personal chores when she was New York&rsquo;s health commissioner.</p>
<p>Novello entered the plea in Albany County Court, where prosecutors unsealed a 20-count indictment that included a charge of defrauding the government, a felony. Novello could face up to 12 years in prison if convicted of all charges.</p>
<p>Novello, originally from Puerto Rico, was released after being ordered to surrender her passport to her lawyer, E. Stewart Jones.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Novello used state workers to chauffeur her on shopping trips and rearrange heavy furniture at her apartment while she was New York&rsquo;s top health official from 1999 to 2006.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;She is here because she has a bull&rsquo;s-eye on her back,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because politics is a contact sport. Because there are people who are vindictive and who wanted to get her ever since she left the state.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The state inspector general said the 2,500 hours of overtime put in by the workers cost taxpayers about $48,000. Novello was paid $256,000 annually while she was health commissioner.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The investigation against Novello started in July 2007 under former Inspector General Kristine Hamann, an appointee of Democratic former Gov. Eliot Spitzer. Soares, the district attorney, is also a Democrat.</p>
<p>Other public servants and politicians have &#8220;done much worse&#8221; yet weren&rsquo;t pursued as aggressively as Novello, Jones said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>It sounds like an open-and-shut case; all the prosecutor will have to do is subpoena the other employees and have them testify under oath.  If Novello is smart, she&rsquo;ll take a plea deal if one is offered.</p>

Yet another example of diversity in the workforce.</p>
<p>Why do these people believe we should like them when they cause nothing but problems for us at work?</p>

			<p>Blacks and mestizos believe this type of behavior is normal and that they are in fact entitled to personal privileges once they reach &#8220;the big house&#8221;.  This corrupt mentality is also the norm in most third world countries.  Then again, third world status is where the USA is headed.  </p>

			<p>Remember her renaming her &#8220;Minority Health&#8221; department the &#8220;Office of the Emerging Majorities?&#8221;</p>
<p>She did that, of course, because she obviously doesn&rsquo;t feel comfortable with Gringoes being more numerous and in control, and the new name was something that she desired so much she wanted to let everybody know about it.  Like the blacks who are given positions by the grace of whites who are quick to say afterward that &#8220;&#8216;We&rsquo; in control now,&#8221; this mestizo bigot wants to feel as if &#8220;her people&#8221; are in control&hellip;or soon will be.</p>
<p>The really unfortunate thing about the situation when it occurred is that there was at least one Republican who said she did so as a way of making non-whites &#8220;feel good.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s no wonder these gullible, naive Republicans keep getting their butts kicked.  They can&rsquo;t recognize non-white racism when they see it.</p>
<p>We truly need a third party.  If the collapse comes as expected, that would be a great time to start one, so we can prepare to try secession as a last resort before we erupt into racial warfare with non-whites and their self-hating white supporters.</p>
<p>Jim Trafficant got several years in prison for about the same thing, only his transgressions amounted to far less than what this disgusting creature is guilty of.  I look for her to get just a slap on the wrist and probation.</p>
<p>We have no leaders right now who are equipped with spines.</p>

			<p>Novello was an affirmative action hire appointed by Republican Governor George Pataki in another failed attempt to attract minorities to the GOP.</p>
<p>The GOP likely considered her a &#8220;two-fer&#8221; since she&rsquo;s hispanic AND female. Now that Obama is being pressured to appoint a Latina to the Supreme Court he should consider Antonia Novello. </p>

			<p>Flamethrower, you&rsquo;re exactly right. The mindset of entitlement is something these criminals seems to be born with. The &#8220;macho&#8221; image is a thing of the past, if it ever existed. What they and their leaders believe is that the good old USA was established to take care of them and their families for generations. While the Hispanics are the largest group of offenders, most of the world&rsquo;s unfortunates have decided we owe it to them to care for them from birth to death, and our government does nothing to change their minds. From the misinterpreted anchor baby law, the gravy trains roars on. And guess who foots the bill?</p>
