<h1><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/19/steele-associates-pay-spurs-questions/">RNC&rsquo;s Steele Associates&rsquo; Pay Spurs Questions</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ralph Z. Hallow, Washington Times, May 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Michael S. Steele took over as chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier this year, he brought along longtime personal assistant Belinda Cook and gave her a salary nearly three times what her predecessor made.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cook&rsquo;s son, Lee, also landed an RNC job.</p>
<p>Mr. Steele hired another family friend, Angela Sailor, to be the party&rsquo;s outreach director at a salary of $180,000, more than double her predecessor&rsquo;s compensation, though new responsibilities have been added to the job, according to a high-ranking RNC official and Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings.</p>
<p>Mr. Steele&rsquo;s early record and personnel decisions figure to be hot topics at a special meeting of Republican state party chairmen Tuesday and Wednesday at National Harbor in Washington&rsquo;s Maryland suburbs. His hiring of friends and the salaries he is paying them already helped to instigate a struggle over who controls the party&rsquo;s purse strings, one that forced the new party chairman to relinquish some control to elected RNC members.</p>
<p>&#8220;These salaries we hear about are way out of line for what staff should be paid for working for a political party, which most of us think of as a cause,&#8221; said Hawaii Republican Party Chairman Willis Lee. &#8220;And if certain staff at the national committee are making that much, then the public understandably might think they are examples of cronyism.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But many complaints will focus on staff compensation. Some party officials have said that the salaries appear generous compared with those paid for similar positions under previous RNC head Robert M. &#8220;Mike&#8221; Duncan.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we are talking about paying someone three times what his predecessor made, it would be wise to make sure all 168 members of the national committee know who these people being hired are and what their qualifications are for being paid that much,&#8221; Texas RNC member Cathie Adams said.</p>
<p>According to take-home-pay figures that the RNC filed with the FEC for March of this year, Mrs. Cook, Mr. Steele&rsquo;s personal assistant, earned $7,134.66 for the month, after withholding for federal and state taxes, which would amount to $85,615.92 over 12 months.</p>
<p>The person who held the same post under Mr. Duncan took home $2,436.74 monthly, or $29,240.88 over 12 months, FEC reports showed. The RNC official, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because he wasn&rsquo;t authorized to disclose the figures, said Mrs. Cooks salary before deductions is $125,000.</p>
<p>As for Lee Cook, he earned $3,251.77 in March, about $39,021.24 a year after taxes, according to the FEC.</p>
<p>The salary being paid to Ms. Sailor, a former White House aide, is $180,000 a year, according to the RNC official. That is $40,000 more than the $140,000 paid to Jan Larimer, the elected RNC co-chairman, the second-highest elective post in the party directly behind Mr. Steele, the official said.</p>
<p>Ms. Sailor&rsquo;s salary is also $97,000 more than the $83,000 Mr. Duncan paid to his outreach director, Shannon Reeves.</p>
<p>The RNC reported to the FEC in 2008 that Mr. Reeves&rsquo; salary in May was $4,755.07, which would total $57,060.84 over 12 months. The FEC report lists Ms. Sailor&rsquo;s take-home pay as $8,557.59 for March, which would total $102,691.08 in yearly salary after taxes. The figures are lower than their actual salary because the party reports to the FEC the take-home pay after taxes.</p>
<p>Ms. Sailor&rsquo;s job has been upgraded from what the position was under Mr. Duncan, the RNC says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under the &#8220;good governance&#8221; pact that he reluctantly agreed to last week, Mr. Steele will retain sole say over who is hired and at what salary at the RNC. State party leaders typically have both their staffs and salary scales approved by executive committees and by the larger state GOP central committees.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The three resolutions on the agenda will be debated and voted on in open session.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not up for discussion or a vote is a resolution to limit Mr. Steele&rsquo;s control over the spending of hundreds of millions of dollars from donors across the nation. Mr. Steele agreed to abide by the essence of that resolution until it is debated and voted on at the regularly scheduled annual summer RNC meeting in July in San Diego.</p>

			<p>A black man getting a position of power and using it to hook his &#8216;bruthas&rsquo; up with high-paying jobs?  Where have I seen this before?<br>
Steele is an absolute joke.  He&rsquo;s not even a conservative but he was made head of the RNC simply because of his race.  Just another reason why I am no longer active in the GOP.  All the time and money I used to give to the GOP now goes to race-realist groups and anti-immigration groups.  If some clown like Jeb Bush get the GOP nomination in 2012 I think enough people will be ready to bail on the GOP that we may finally have a chance to put together a populist third-party with a legitimate chance of success.</p>

			<p>Black skin costs extra.  A lot extra.  But don&rsquo;t worry folks, black skin means a pass from the media so no biggie (that includes covering for lack of ability, odd behavior, criminality - just about anything you can think of!).  Just get all the white moms and pops who fund the RP to dig a lil&rsquo; deeper.</p>

			<p>Hiring Steele to bring &#8220;hop hip&#8221; to the party was the most desperate, embarassing idea since New Coke.  Now Steele is in the hen house and he didn&rsquo;t even wait three months before he started looting it.  Not only is he embarassing to watch on TV and embarassing to listen to, with his talk about making the party &#8220;off the hook&#8221; (whatever that means in English), but now they have to acknowledge that he&rsquo;s basically stealing by hiring friends and family at up to three times the standard salary for a particular position.  I guess that&rsquo;s what he meant when he said it was going to be &#8220;off the hook,&#8221; a license to loot other peoples&rsquo; money.  All this further illustrates my belief that America is no longer a serious country, and that it is basically in the hands of children.</p>

			<p>Steele is one of the reasons I left the GOP.  Well, to be precise, the culture within the GOP that felt that the party had to name an unqualified black to this position is why I left.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost patience with the nerdy bloodless types in the GOP who constantly look for cover so they won&rsquo;t be called racists.</p>

			<p>Because no Whitie&rsquo;s good to lead the G.O.P.<br>
They found a Black man of  ultimate degree.<br>
He happened to be Sir Michael Steele<br>
Whose honesty is hard as steel.</p>
<p>Not losing time for playing fun,<br>
He brought at once his loving son.<br>
Detesting stupid Whitie bums <br>
He hired the best his loyal chums.<br>
Because the honest Michael Steele<br>
Exactly  knows all ways to steal. <br>

			<p>These scandals are constant. I&rsquo;m from a town that had the held the state prison. Cops were in the paper for being taken-down for corruption constantly. In the town I live now, the sheriff from a neighboring county was on TV almost every night about a news or crime story. After around a year or more of being on local TV news all the time he found himself arrested and behind bars on a scandal of his own. It must make us little folks feel better seeing the popular and powerful getting their comeuppance.</p>

			<p>The way this article sounds Mr. Steele should be chairman of the ANC not the RNC.</p>

			<p>I recently dropped out of the Republican party and changed my registration to Independent. When Steele is gone, depending upon who replaces him, I&rsquo;ll be back</p>

			<p>After the most honest and iron-clad conservative was chosen to provide national leadership for the Republican Party of the United State I got a <br>
call from the office to continue my donations.</p>
<p>Below is the respond I gave. </p>
<p>My honest friends, that would not be a problem I said and let me, my honest friends, give you my the most politically correct honest reply. <br>
You honestly had come to the conclusion that no white honest man can chair his party, from now on, my honest friends, go and ask money<br>
 from the honest black conservatives who all those years generously had been supporting the honest G.O.P. Cross out my name from the list <br>
and, while you honestly rely on blacks and Latinos for support don&rsquo;t honestly contact me in any honest possible and impossible way. </p>
<p>So are no givin&rsquo; me no thin&rsquo;, ma-an?</p>
<p>Well, ma-an, you are wrong. I have a broken penny for you. How would you like to get it?</p>
<p>The ma-an did not appreciate my honest generosity and hung up on me. </p>
<p>The broken penny is Steele waiting. <br>

			<p>I was recently given info about joining a local Republican women&rsquo;s group.  I thought about it, even though I voted for Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution party.  I decided not to do so, and now this story confirms I was right.  I guess my membership dues would have partially gone to support the Steele rino and his cronies.  Not me, no sir.</p>

			<p>I remember reading quite a few comments on here from people declaring they would rather have had Steele in the White House than Obama. When I read those comments I thought, some people still don&rsquo;t get it. It&rsquo;s never a good thing when a black gets into a position of power.</p>

			<p>Let this be a lesson.  If you give money to the RNC it goes straight into the coffers of overpaid affirmative action hires and their homeys.  While they&rsquo;re at their annual meeting in San Diego maybe they should discuss how that hip hop thing is working out.  Maybe they should also discuss voting for a new Chairman.  A new Gallup Poll shows only 20% of people self identify as Republican now and my local headquarters says the RNC is in big financial trouble. I get a form letter every two weeks from the RNC with Michael Steele&rsquo;s name in big print on the envelope asking for donations to renew my membership.  The first one I pitched in the trash then the second one came and somebody in marketing wisely decided to take his name off the envelope just to get people to open it.  I gave it back to the Postmaster saying &#8220;refused, return to sender&#8221;.  After three of these I get another form letter from the Treasurer himself asking if I&rsquo;ve deserted the party and pleading for donations.  A week later I get another membership card!  Unbelievable.  I put the whole thing in a mailer and sent it back to them.  </p>

			<p>The revolt against race replacement has to start at a very fundamental level. It starts with individual Native Born White Americans being committed to two things:1)opposing there race replacement at the hands of post-1965 hispanics,asians,muslims and africans and 2)a committment to restoring Native Born White Americans to 90 percent of the American population like it was before the passage of the 1965 immigration reformm act.</p>
<p>From here the next step is emergence of small support networks of Native Born White Americans in commuities across the nation. Then after this the networking of these small cells across the nation. This has to much more fundamental than voting at this point in time.</p>
<p>A highly recommend that yo all go to Ralph Nader&rsquo;s website. He hs a grassroots blueprint that easily be adapted to the White Nationalist revolt. Nader lays out a blueprint for developing grassroots democratic political structures that would act as a very powerfull force to keep politicians acountable. I&rsquo;m not talkng about republican and democratic polticians. I&rsquo;m talking about holding White Nationalist polticians accountable. The temptation for selling out will always be there. This is where it all starts:at the bottom,not at the top.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m just shocked, shocked.  And I thought only Southern whites practiced ethnic nepotism and blacks are here to instruct us on how to be fair and post racial.  </p>
<p>This reminds me of when, in the mid 1990&rsquo;s, a black superintendent was hired in a neighboring city school district.  He hired a couple of his &#8220;bros&#8221; who in turn hired several of their bros, and well you kind of get the picture.  The school district was over 65% white at that time but they were emphasizing black self esteem and black pride.  This was followed by an exodus of whites into surrounding areas and an explosion in home schooling and private school enrollment.</p>
<p>When the district began verifying the credentials of all these fine black people it was revealed that many falsified their resumes and/or purchased their college degrees.  A few even had criminal records, imagine that.  It&rsquo;s the same story every time blacks ascend to positions of power.   </p>
