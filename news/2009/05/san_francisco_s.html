			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Swift, Mercury News (San Francisco), May 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Along 24th Street in Noe Valley, the BabyBjorn carriers are out in force.</p>
<p>In this predominantly white enclave of San Francisco that some locals quip should be dubbed, &#8220;Strollerville,&#8221; parents walk past upscale shops with infants snuggled in the fashionable Swedish chest carriers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Births in the 94114 Zip code, which includes Noe Valley and the Castro, the historical center for San Francisco gay life, were about 50 percent higher in 2007 than in the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>Urban enclaves like Noe Valley and the Castro may sound like unlikely places for a baby boom. But they are at the vanguard of a national urban trend that, according to U.S. Census estimates, has given San Francisco its biggest brood of young children since the early 1970s.</p>
<p>&#8220;All you have to do is stand out there for five minutes and you&rsquo;ll see a stroller,&#8221; said Carol Yenne, the owner of Small Frys, a specialty clothing store for young children in Noe Valley.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been a demographic boom in the gay community having kids,&#8221; said San Francisco Supervisor Bevan Dufty, a gay man raising his 21/2-year-old daughter with a lesbian partner.</p>
<p>San Francisco has seen a 24 percent jump in its under-5 population since 2000, recent census data shows. Three-quarters of the increase was among whites. But even cities like Portland, whereas in San Francisco, local officials were wringing their hands a few years ago about the lack of children, are seeing a surge in children.</p>
<p>San Jose, where the child population has been flat since 2000, is a notable exception.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there is a new generation of white, well-off parents who want to stay in the city, in high-amenity cities like San Francisco, New York, Washington, D.C., and Portland,&#8221; said Bill Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution. &#8220;They are willing to pay for private schools and child-safe neighborhoods in order to do this. It&rsquo;s a trend that wasn&rsquo;t apparent for the baby boomers, who left for the suburbs when they started having kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>While San Francisco has had perhaps the most dramatic kid increase relative to its overall growth, the number of infants, toddlers and young children is growing faster than the overall population in most big cities.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean big cities are poised to reverse the pattern of post World War II America, where young middle-class parents moved to the suburbs to raise their children.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a trend that&rsquo;s going to sweep the country,&#8221; Frey said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s going to sweep pockets of wealth and privilege and upper middle-class lifestyles.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in San Francisco, Seattle, Portland and even Manhattan, all cities where officials worried a few years ago about the dwindling number of children, white families are fueling increases in the child population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city has seen an influx of highly educated professionals, a &#8220;creative class,&#8221; Adams said. &#8220;Like Seattle and San Francisco and the Bay Area, they care a lot about the sustainability and quality of life. That has attracted a lot of the younger, creative types who now are of childbearing age.&#8221;</p>
<p>Relative to other big cities, children remain a relatively small share of the population in San Francisco. But the city topped 9,000 births in 2007 for the first time since 1994, and the San Francisco Unified School District received 500 more applications for kindergarten spots this year than last, the second year kindergarten applications surged.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some, like Yenne, say children are back for good in San Francisco. With private commuter buses from Google and other Silicon Valley companies cruising Noe Valley to pick up tech workers each morning, Yenne says the tradition of working in a city and raising kids in the suburbs has flipped for some.</p>

			<p>I have noticed this for some time now in San Francisco.It is something that I am not used to seeing, and  it actually seems weird to me. But I hope that I will get used to it soon.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed more babies in the Portland, OR area recently too - but not enough of them.  When I meet a white couple with two kids, I&rsquo;ll smile, give them a thumbs up, and say &#8220;that&rsquo;s GREAT!  Only one more to go for replacement level&#8221; or something to that effect.  Yesterday I told a white woman friend of mine, who is to wed a very intelligent white man soon, that it is their DUTY to have children.  Just as many of us scowl at mixed race couples and avoid them, so too should we show our approval and encouragement toward white couples who have white children.</p>

			<p>There is already great concern about black flight from San F. and attempts to stop it:</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-08-26-urban-blacks_N.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-08-26-urban-blacks_N.htm</a> </p>
<p> Now too many white babies are being born there! Wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the blacks demanded forced sterilization for San F. white women - must maintain diversity no matter how much crime &amp; deterioration it brings.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad to hear someone saying this.  When I&rsquo;m in public with my young children, most of the positive comments and smiles I get are actually from black women.  Many whites, particularly older whites, just scowl and act like they&rsquo;re annoyed that I had the nerve to take my kids in public. (And, no my kids aren&rsquo;t loud or bad-behaved.)</p>
<p>It seems from this story that what is actually going on here is that more whites are staying in the city limits and having kids rather than moving out to the suburbs.  This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that more white children are being born; it simply means that they are being born in a different location.</p>
<p>Still, I would be interested in seeing some updated stats on the white birthrate.  My own observations make me think that something unexpected and positive is going on.  I am in my mid-20s and already have 2 kids (and plan on having at least 3 more).  Almost all of my colleagues and buddies from back in college are getting married and having children.  When I dropped my son off at his all white daycare last week, I overheard one of the daycare workers say, &#8220;What is going on?  It seems like all the mothers here are pregnant.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is often said that generations tend to behave similarly to their grandparents&rsquo; generation.  Maybe people my age are turning their backs on the &#8220;me first&#8221; attitude of the baby boomers and opting for large families.</p>

			<p>Nature screams out: MULTIPLY YOUR KIND (whatever your kind is). Over the past decades, whites seem to have overridden their natural instincts (where that message from nature is stored), but maybe, just maybe, that&rsquo;s changing. I hope so.</p>
<p>Can never have too many white people.</p>

<p>Dear Lord, what a horrifying thought.  Every time you think the urban liberal cannot become more perverse nor more detached from nature, they do exactly that.  I shudder to think of how indoctrinated this generation of liberal gay-babies will be.</p>
<p>Question:  Since gay men cannot produce children (lesbians pretty much can), how much of this baby boom is actually imported from other areas?</p>

			<p>When I was in SF 10 years ago, I was told that gays were moving out of SF. Now that homosexuality was tolerated in the US, the gays were moving out. Arizona and New Hamshire were the favored places.<br>
   Before they left, they integreated a few black neighborhoods. Gays took advantage of the low real estate prices and bought homes. Groups of gays would invest in homes, so there was always some strong man watching the place. The blacks would move elsewhere. More gays would move in, then real estate values would soar because blacks left. Gays sold these houses for a big profit to straights and move to arizona or NH.<br>
   The Castro district is shrinking. They do have the Fulson street fair, but each year people are voicing their opposition to it. In ten years it will be gone due to lack of interest.<br>
   If this keeps up, I am thinking of moving to SF for retirement.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s great!  I hope it is the beginning of a much larger trend among white people  &#8220;who care about the quality of life&#8221;.   &#8220;White families are fueling increases in the child population&#8221; : music to my ears! </p>
<p>Long way to go though.  May all capable whites recall the joy of large families, which were typical of previous generations.     </p>

			<p>Well, this is good news in more ways than one:</p>
<p>First the obvious: more whites are being born.</p>
<p>Second:  Much of the increase is in the well-educated community.</p>
<p>Third:  Gentrification appears to be alive and well.</p>

			<p>More Whites from San Francisco stock is not necessarily a good thing.  I doubt these children will be raised to be proud of their heritage.  Rather, they will be taught the evils of those that came before them and how they must feel guilty for the flesh that they were born into.</p>
<p>If we hear of an increase in child birth from places such as that town in Georgia that has White proms, then that would be reason to celebrate.  However, an increase in future progressives doesn&rsquo;t excite me at all.</p>

<p><br>
Unfortunately, these are probably all ardent left-wingers who will raise thoroughly indoctrinated chilren who will in turn support all the very policies that are destructive to them and their kind.  <br>
I hope I am wrong.</p>

			<p>Perhaps some of the New Policing policies instituted by the likes of Mayor Giuliani are having the effect of making some places actually livable again for Whites!!  </p>
<p>Also I think some Whites aren&rsquo;t buying the &#8216;have less kids for the enviroments sake&rsquo; line of thinking when they see hordes of Browns crawling over the border every year and so do not take this leftist notion into consideration anymore.  </p>

			<p>I wonder how much the crime will drop?  I lived in SF for 9 years and it will be a much better place once the blacks and white liberals leave.  No blacks, know peace.  They were the worst people I encountered in SF due to their entitlement attitude.</p>

			<p>I wonder what percentage of these children of homo-sexual creepy couplings, along with the children of upwardly mobile young professionals are from West Virginia or Eastern Tennessee, Kentucky, Western Pennsylvania, or Western North Carolina?<br>
     I doubt if the entire horde of high enders produce a  single private first class. Our seed corn is being ground down by poverty, neglect, and imperialistic wars fought by these precious folks while the trendies make money on it and cruise bars trying to hit on them..<br>
     Our Scotch-Irish back bone needs to at last wake up from being the Highlanders of the English Throne and turn their weapons against their real oppressors, the rich power elite who wax hot in un-natural lust, greed, sloth, and avarice. It would be refreshing to see the Walter Reed parking lot full of limos with grieving parents in the back seats instead of broken hearted hilly billy mothers getting off the Greyhound after a 16 hour ride.<br>

<p>Right! if people can afford it, it seems to be the  fashion statement to &#8220;adopt&#8221; black or OTHER kids, usually from Africa&hellip;thank you Madonna, Bradjolina&hellip;FN idiots.</p>

<p>Well, guess what Bill Frey   &mdash;   if enough white people move back into the city, they won&rsquo;t all need to pay for private school anymore since the public school will have flipped back to a majority white demographic.  The school isn&rsquo;t bad because it&rsquo;s &#8220;urban,&#8221; it&rsquo;s bad because it&rsquo;s majority black.  </p>
<p>Once that milestone has reached, a massive financial burden will have been lifted from the shoulders of white families and fertility should rise further.  I wonder if this very scenario is not what has been responsible for the otherwise mysterious rise in the white birth rate in these cities?</p>
