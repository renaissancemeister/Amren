			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Murray Wardrop, Telegraph (London), May 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An aspiring model and television presenter who was raped by a man she met on Facebook and then had acid thrown in her face described her ordeal as &#8220;worse than death&#8221;.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old was left partially blind in one eye, suffered third-degree burns and can now only eat through a plastic tube after a cup of sulphuric acid was thrown in her face.</p>
<p>A court heard her harrowing testimony as martial arts expert Daniel Lynch, 33, and Stefan Sylvestre, 20, were jailed for life over the two attacks which have left her a &#8220;broken woman&#8221;.</p>
<p>The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was beaten and raped by Lynch in March last year after he met her on the social networking website.</p>
<p>A few days later, his accomplice Sylvestre calmly approached her in the street in Golders Green, north London, and threw a cup of sulphuric acid in her face.</p>
<p>She suffered severe burns to her face and neck which have left her disfigured for life and can no longer swallow after some of the acid spilt down her throat.</p>
<p>In an impact statement read to London&rsquo;s Wood Green Crown Court, the woman said: &#8220;I have lost my future, my career, my spirit, my body, my looks, my dignity  &mdash;  the list goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I am left with is an empty shell. A part of me has died that will never come back. This is worse than death. Being beaten, raped and mutilated with acid has left me feeling like a living corpse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lynch, who had become obsessed with the woman after seeing her on television, was found guilty of rape at a trial in March. The steroid addict, of Shepherds Bush, London, admitted actual bodily harm and was found guilty of grievous bodily harm at previous hearings.</p>
<p>Sylvestre, also of Shepherds Bush, pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm for the attack at an earlier hearing.</p>
<p>Passing sentence, Judge Nicholas Browne QC said: &#8220;(The victim) had a face of pure beauty. You, Danny Lynch and Stefan Sylvestre, represent the face of pure evil. The facts of this case are chilling and shocking.</p>
<p>&#8220;You planned and then executed an act of pure, calculated and deliberate evil.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This happened where I used to live. A woman was raped, blinded, and left for dead in her burning house. She came to our class at university to talk about her ordeal. She never said, but I&rsquo;m almost certain her attacker was black. Statistics certainly bear that assumption out. </p>

<p>This is a quote from the previous article, entitled: &#8220;RAPED BECAUSE I&rsquo;M WHITE<br>
QUOTE: &#8220;Six-footer Moobeng then invited the girls back to his flat for a nightcap. It was there he pounced. Sarah said: &ldquo;He jumped on top of me and started kissing my neck but I kicked him off. I told my friend I wanted to go home before storming into the bathroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do any of you see a pattern with stories like this???</p>

			<p>This is horrible, but two points make me wonder:  Did she know he looked like that from Facebook?  And what motivated the second man, who threw acid on her a few days later?  How was he an accomplice of the first man?  </p>
<p>A double beheading is warranted.  Maybe they can be tried under Sharia law, since it is the UK we are talking about.<br>

			<p>What a coincidence. Last night on the &#8216;ripped from the headlines&rsquo; FOX show &#8216;Lie to Me&rsquo;, they had a criminal case just like this. Multiple women were raped and blinded. Very similar, except that the rapists portrayed on the TV show were white guys.</p>

When will England ban acid?  After all, acid is dangerous and disfigures people.  Without acid England would have a peaceful, law abiding country and all crime would cease to exist.</p>

			<p>Young ladies:  be forewarned.  Third World men have been raised in cultures where women are not put on pedestals or valued as people.  These men often interpret the SLIGHTEST INTEREST shown by you as an agreement to have sex.  If you refuse they become outraged because 1) you wasted their time, and 2) their egos are bruised.</p>
<p>Their worldview is that White women are sexual libertines and too independent, unlike their pure women who are kept under wraps.  They lust after your unique beauty but do not actually like you.  You are a conquest to them.</p>

			<p>What, no mention of the rapists&rsquo; quite obvious &#8220;admixture?&#8221;  We can&rsquo;t do a story about Tiger Woods or Lewis Hamilton here without it.  I&rsquo;d say these guys are probably 50-75% white, the guy on the right looks like a muslim.</p>

			<p>ANOTHER VICTIM OF DIVERSITY&hellip;.<br>
While this story is sad, it&rsquo;s hard to have much sympathy for this woman. Maybe I&rsquo;m just old-fashioned but I think getting with someone you met casually over the internet is risky regardless of the situation. She obviously knew what this guy looked like and though I don&rsquo;t want to say she deserved it, she certainly used bad judgement. This just goes to show that the white &#8220;progressives&#8221; who love dating non-whites and having non-white friends are often the first to get hurt. It also reveals that white women are often multiculturalism&rsquo;s biggest victims.</p>

			<p>Sadly, in Britain a life sentence actually means about 7 to 8 years in conditions no one in US would recognize as a prison, that is they are very comfortable.  </p>

<p>In the interest of correctness, I&rsquo;d like to state that they&rsquo;re in all likelihood African-American. The names are enough to give it away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Third World men have been raised in cultures where women are not put on pedestals or valued as people. These men often interpret the SLIGHTEST INTEREST shown by you as an agreement to have sex&#8221;</p>
<p>Some cultures value the sanctity of women. Many African crowns have been known to be only passed to women. In Africa, women are likely to be treated as equals, although they must be wary of men&rsquo;s sexual desires. Check up the case of the ongoing &#8220;sex strike&#8221; by Kenyan women. In Asia, women are seen as delicate and needing care, and are accorded great respect, though not equality. It seems the older a woman gets the greater the respect, especially after widowhood. This is best demonstrated by the fact that the mothers of Asian monarchs were given more respect than the sovereign themselves (causing them to wield as much power as their reigning son). In the middle-east (an area synonymous with misogyny in these times), honour is important to a family; in many cases they take this too far and murder daughters or wives who dare defy the will of her father or husband. These are known as honour killings and were once seen as acceptable in the eyes of middle-eastern law. Although the founding of Islam has granted women many rights (they were even more oppressed before Mohammad came along), the Middle-East has lagged in women&rsquo;s rights and the rest of the world must do more to convince the responsible Governments to convince the masses that this is not acceptable, and by doing so creating a more tolerant world.</p>

			<p>The article begs the question, &#8220;What was this woman thinking when she decided to go out with a Third-Worlder?&#8221;</p>
<p>Has Britain somehow run out of white men?</p>
<p>I can work up only a little pity for the gal.  She was dim-witted enough (or brainwashed) that she had to learn something firsthand about the Third World that most of us implicitly understand.  </p>
<p>Quite a lesson!  She took white men for granted, and now can&rsquo;t even take being able to swallow food for granted.</p>

			<p>Pete is right.White women date some black or muslim and expect them to act like a civilised white man. Then when it blows up in their face, they are standing there looking like a burnt Wile E. Coyote. Like the comedian said &#8220;everybody is for diversity til you start pointing out people are different&#8221;. My 11 year old already understands these fundamental diferences&hellip;and what is allowed by Dad. I point out often that the reason the news is virtually all black violent criminals is because in Memphis virtually all violent criminals are black!!??   </p>

			<p> Honestly, have the women gone mad in London? Looking at their pictures, Mr. Lynch and Mr.Sylvestre are two pretty scary looking thugs. One is a martial arts expert. What would a &#8220;model&#8221; and &#8220;television presenter&#8221; want with them? I guess they could all go together to a Shakespeare play at the New Globe Theater? The acid assault by Sylestre hit a new low in human behavior.</p>

			<p>The man in the right photo has something wrong with his face and neck.  Did the acid splash on him, or did he resist arrest?  We need more details on this case especially about the ethnicity of the woman harmed.</p>

			<p>When I traveled in UK years ago, there was a bill-board ad campaign promoting seat belt usage. It featured people with faces covered with fresh sutures &amp; horrific bruises, saying things like &#8220;Gosh, I wish I&rsquo;d used my seat belt.&#8221;  What UK needs now is a similar ad campaign showing these newly scarred victims, saying &#8220;I wish I had avoided non-whites&hellip; I would not now be blinded, disfigured, &amp; all but destroyed.&#8221; </p>
<p>Seriously: Why not?  If using seat belts save lives, so does the simple act of avoiding non-whites.  I do both, myself.  It&rsquo;s common sense. I say, let&rsquo;s put those stomach-turning, gruesome bill-boards back up. Let&rsquo;s all be schocked back into reality.</p>

			<p>Acid attacks are epidemic throughout the Muslim world&hellip;.. which now includes Europe.</p>
<p>Immivasion in Europe has turned the average European into a closet &#8220;fascist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The failure of assimilation has been absolute, and Europe is now awash in violent crime the likes of which would have been utterly inconceivable even 20 years ago.</p>
<p>WE already see the beginnings of a massive political shift here, but even if borders are sealed up tight, two questions remain: </p>
<p>1) Can a significant number of invaders be induced to leave? Will any country accept them? (I&rsquo;ll answer my own question; NO!)</p>
<p>2) Can they be prevented from outbreeding Europeans to the point of conquest? Their Achilles heel is that most live on handouts from working Europeans, so shutting down the welfare system might cause a large percentage to either leave or have fewer children.</p>
<p>Most whites will remain in a PC daze until there is a breakthrough in the popular culture on both sides of the Atlantic, which will begin with enough people simply speaking up and breaking all the current rules of &#8220;etiquette.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Curiously, Michael Savage, banned for life from the UK, has - to the best of my knowledge - never beaten, raped or acid-burned any women, either in Britain or anywhere else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to know the Home Office has their priorities straight over who should be allowed to visit their rain-drenched country: Third-world rapists - yes.  Self-impressed talk show hosts - no.</p>
