			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Heather Mac Donald, New York Post, May 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THE New York Civil Liberties Union last week lodged another &#8220;racial-profiling&#8221; complaint about the NYPD, pointing to statistics for the first three months of 2009: 52 percent of all people stopped for questioning by the police were black, whereas 9 percent were white.</p>
<p>It would be illuminating if the NYCLU suggested what the proper percentage of stops should be for the various racial and ethnic groups. Doing so might force it to acknowledge the following facts about crime in New York: Blacks commit about 68 percent of all violent crime in the city, according to police records, though they are just 24 percent of the city&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>That crime number comes from victims and witnesses when they report attacks to the police. According to data from victims and witnesses, blacks commit about 82 percent of all shootings and 72 percent of all robberies. Whites commit about 5 percent of all violent crimes, though they make up 35 percent of the city&rsquo;s population, and commit 1 percent of shootings and about 4 percent of robberies.</p>
<p>Now, given these crime rates, whom exactly does the NYCLU think the NYPD should be stopping? Police enforcement activity can reflect criminal behavior or population ratios  &mdash;  not both.</p>
<p>If stop-and-frisks mirrored the city&rsquo;s racial, rather than crime, demographics, as the NYCLU seems to think they should, the police would be ignoring where crime is actually occurring and who its victims and perpetrators are. Recall that victims and witnesses report in 1 percent of all shootings in the city that the perpetrator was white.</p>
<p>When the police are trying to track down a shooting suspect, therefore, only 1 percent of the time are they looking for a white suspect. If the police were pressured into racial parity for gun stops, they would be ignoring victim identifications and misallocating their resources in a massive way.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wherever a rash of shootings or robberies breaks out, commanders will respond by flooding the zone with officers. The highest-crime areas of the city are those with the highest proportion of black residents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The same proportion of stops of blacks and whites  &mdash;  12 percent  &mdash;  results in a summons or an arrest, suggesting that the police use the same behavioral factors in deciding whom to stop. The NYCLU claims that this summons and arrest rate is too low, without revealing what a proper rate might be.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New York&rsquo;s sky-high crime rate of the late &rsquo;80s and early &rsquo;90s was turned around when the police started proactively using their powers to get criminals off the streets and to deter others from engaging in crime. Being stopped, questioned or frisked by an officer when you have done nothing wrong is an annoyance, which the police must mitigate by courteous behavior and an explanation for the stop. Getting shot, however, is more than an annoyance; it can be a life destroyer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a suggestion for the NYCLU: If you want to lower the rate of police activity in black neighborhoods, put some effort into lowering the crime rate. Attacking the police for fighting crime is a dangerous distraction.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s the flip side of all of this.  If the NYPD (or any PD) race-norm their frisks, then they&rsquo;ll have to frisk a white for far less than they frisk a black.  This means they&rsquo;ll have to pick on more whites, or ignore more blacks, or both.  It&rsquo;s like the airline searches, TSA must search more white elderly women so that CAIR/ACLU don&rsquo;t whine.</p>

			<p> They fail to mention it is also sexist, otherwise 52% of those stopped would be female and how about 0% females in prison for raping males, where is the justice in this? We need &#8220;equality&#8221; not common sense.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t know which surprised me more about this article:</p>
<p>1) That it ran in a major New York city periodical (the New York Post) or</p>
<p>2) That the author didn&rsquo;t engage in the obligatory &#8220;black crime is due soley to poverty and evil White racism&#8221; malarkey.  She just let the facts speak for themselves.</p>
<p>I am sending the editors at the Post an e-mail commending them for printing a refreshingly candid look at black crime in New York.  Others should do the same.  This type of journalism should be encouraged.</p>

<p>You must not be familiar with her work.  She&rsquo;s about as big-time as race-realists (relatively speaking) get.</p>

			<p> Ms. McDonald has hit the nail right on the head. The percentages of a given population made up by any racial or ethnic group do not necessarily correlate with the percentages of anything else   &mdash;   including stop-and-frisk and arrest rates.</p>
<p> These claims by the ACLU of &#8220;bias&#8221; on the part of patroling officers ignore facts such as that, a significant proportion of officers in urban areas are themselves black and presumably wouldn&rsquo;t deliberately discriminate against their own racial group; and that with today&rsquo;s heavily tinted vehicle windows, easily telling the race of a driver of a moving vehicle can be difficult to impossible.</p>

			<p>Reminds me of an episode of COPS. A blck guy was dealing drugs right in front of where children were playing, in a black neighborhood. The cops went after him, he ran, threw a gun and drugs near the kids, and after a short chase was tackled hard and bloodied up a bit. After he was in cuffs, several of the parents of the playing children came up to the cops, initially i thought they were going to thank them. They they started screaming at how hard the drug dealer was taken down. A riot almost broke out. 50-60 people were there yelling at the po po about how hard they took the guy down&hellip; It was like an alternate universe. There seems to be little reason in those communities.</p>

			<p>Joseph Wambaugh, perhaps the most realistic police writer ever to put pen to paper, said it best when discussing race-based complaints against police enforcement in his novel &#8220;Hollywood Station.&#8221; </p>
<p>The whimpering and whining of cry-baby outfits like the NYCLU brings along things like federal consent decrees, which essentially tell police departments, &#8220;We don&rsquo;t care how you do it, just bring down the percentage of blacks that get stopped.&#8221; </p>
<p>What this ultimately results in is falsified contact reports (i.e. ficticious white people stopped in black ghettos where no white person would EVER go), and/or &#8220;de-policing.&#8221; The former is outright lying, and the latter is just plain dangerous. </p>
<p>However, the dimwits who currently shape American cultural imperatives have somehow told the rest of us that placating blacks is the name of the game. </p>

			<p>Anonymous at 1:41 PM hit the nail on the head.  <br>
Out of one side of their mouths, blacks complain that there isn&rsquo;t enough police in their neighborhoods and that the cops take too long to respond to calls etc., etc. Then when the cops actually do their job they scream &#8220;racial profiling!&#8221;  and &#8220;police brutality!&#8221;.  <br>
I feel sorry for White cops stationed in black districts&hellip;</p>

			<p>It is refreshing to finally see articles that aren&rsquo;t afraid to look at the truth. Maybe this is a sign of change? No more political correctness nonsense! For too long we have listened to groups like the NYCLU and ACLU. These organizations are only a crutch for minorities to cling to. Why try to change your situation, when you can cry victim and have someone else fight for you? Blacks commit the majority of crime, yet they complain about being arrested and put in jail?  But it&rsquo;s not right to profile????? </p>
