<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Allan Hoffenblum gave a roomful of mostly Republicans a hard look in the mirror at the Balboa Bay Club today. The major cause of the continued deterioration of the GOP in California is that it has done little to attract minorities, women and youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s become a white man&rsquo;s party,&#8221; he said at the Newport Beach luncheon.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The Latino and Asian populations continue to grow, and they&rsquo;ve stopped voting Republican,&#8221; said Hoffenblum, former political director for the state GOP and now an elections handicapper.</p>
<p>Among the state&rsquo;s white, non-Hispanic voters, 40 percent are Democrat and 42 percent are Republican. Among Latinos, 57 percent Democrat and 19 percent Republican. Among Asians, 30 percent Democrat and 29 percent Republican (and a whopping 39 percent independent).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the state&rsquo;s 33 Democratic members of Congress, 54 percent are women. Five are Latino and three are black. Just nine are white, non-Hispanic men.</p>
<p>Among the state&rsquo;s 19 Republican members of Congress, there are 18 white males and Mary Bono. Hoffenblum ran down similar ratios in the state Legislature.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to Latinos, I think it&rsquo;s because of the shrillness of the debate on illegal immigration,&#8221; he said for that minority&rsquo;s reluctance to join the Grand Ole Party. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not the message  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s delivered. Latinos and younger voters think we don&rsquo;t like them.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Correction, the Latino and Asian minorities NEVER voted Republican. It has been the Republicans who have foresaken their<br>
natural base of white Christians. George Bush couldn&rsquo;t schmooz enough with the Mexican Kleptocrats and couldn&rsquo;t invite enough<br>
Hispanics to partake of welfare and free education and medical care. Who needs &#8220;Republicans&#8221; if they are no different from the<br>
Democrats.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Non-white populations continue to grow, and they&rsquo;ve stopped voting Republican.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written this many times, but it bears repeating.  The greatest incindiary bomb we have in this country, behind the economy, is the population explosion.  </p>
<p>The least little event that occurs, whether it&rsquo;s a drought or a manmade disaster, is going to seriously affect food and water.</p>
<p>And, it is the big bonus takers, the self-described hotshot corporate types who push for economic growth, rather than self-sufficient sanity, because of their past and present desire to satisfy their insatiable greed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big come uppence for them to have to endure the loss of incoming revenue, as well as being now thought of as the instigators of our present depression.</p>
<p>Now, they hold a status below used car salesman and politician, and it&rsquo;s a common sight to see one of them taken away in handcuffs.</p>

			<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter who whites vote for, because the government discriminates against Whites:<br>
	Under the guise of protecting racial minorities, government laws, programs, and practices discriminate against white Americans: in hiring and promotion, in access to loans for business and housing, in college admission and scholarships, and in numerous other ways that affect livelihoods of Whites. Showing favoritism to any individual due to race is not only incongruous, but harmful&hellip; true equality may only be achieved by merit, and intellectual capacity<br>

<p>Nope, not quite right there at all Comrade Hoffenblum.</p>
<p>The more accurate quote would be: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s become a white man&rsquo;s party, far too late in the game to matter in California anymore!&rsquo;</p>

			<p>One of the &#8220;too White, too male&#8221; members of the audience should have done what I have done in similar situations: Agree, and say that to increase Republican Diversity, your policy will be to not vote for any Republican candidate. </p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do it to Republican reps, but I have done it to salesmen for companies that brag about their Diversity, such as Ford, Verizon, and GM. I told them that while I liked their product, I would not consider its purchase because I wanted to help the company become more Diverse. &#8220;Diversity&#8221;, I said. &#8220;must include the consumers, not just the producers&#8221;.</p>

When Reagan took a hard line against Castro, the Cuban exile community feel in love with Reagan and the GOP. On this, the GOP &#8216;Hispanic strategy&rsquo; was born.</p>
<p>Of course, the Miami Cubans were a small slice of the hispanic pie but the GOP extrapolated countless votes from &#8216;conservative&rsquo; hispanics (a true minority) based on this one group and their anti-Castro hate.</p>
<p>The GOP was lied to and they fooled themselves into believing hispanics were an untapped gold mine of conservative voters. I still don&rsquo;t believe they want to give up that dream.</p>
<p>The GOP no longer talk about attracting the conservative hispanic vote (as I said, a true minority), but now talk about getting the hispanic vote by being &#8216;inclusive&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The dream and self-delusion lives on.<br>

			<p>The Republican Party are so afraid of the word, racist, that they have sold out a long time ago. John McCain and Michael Steele is proof of that. The Republican Party has no use for Whites, only for their votes and money, period. Notice how Rush, Hannity, Levin, Billy Cunningham, etc. hate to mention the hard facts of race and if race comes up how they pander to their black callers and give them plenty of air time?  But let a White speak out some truths and they are quickly disconnected and ridiculed and labeled a racist, nazi, etc&hellip;.</p>

			<p>The Republicans are just Democrat-lite (and not even that light).  If the Republicans would focus on what is good for the USA (which incidentally  is also what is good for whites and non-whites alike) they might just pick up a vote or two.  And who wants to vote for a party that is self-deprecating?  Can you imagine the Democrats saying that Detroit Democrats were too black and too female?<br>

<p><p>How typical of the Golden State GOP, compulsively disparaging their most consistently loyal voting base: white men.<p>But don&rsquo;t worry, Hoffenblum: this white man has left the California GOP, never <b>ever</b> to return, and I&rsquo;m confident that there&rsquo;re many thousands more like me to follow.  Soon you and your opportunistic party hack buddies can have a No Man&rsquo;s Party in California to whine about, if there&rsquo;s still anyone around here that knows enough English to understand you. </p></p></p>

<p>A sign of what is to come throughout the U.S. as so many posters here have pointed out. As long ago as Plato, it was feared that the weakness involved in democracy, as a political system, representative or otherwise, is that, the &#8220;common rabble&#8221;,(this is how is is often described) will vote for whoever gives them more of the States riches. California is an example.</p>

			<p>California Republicans obsessively whore after the hispanic vote, spending big bucks and tons of time pandering, all to little avail.   </p>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t the &#8220;shrillness&#8221; of immigration alone (by the way, &#8220;shrillness&#8221; in an article like this means &#8220;we should enforce our laws&#8221; and &#8220;reasonable&#8221; means &#8220;we should not have a border and pay for everything illegals want&#8221;), it&rsquo;s the spending-union-race axis that dominates minority votes in CA.</p>
<p>If you want to hear real shrillness, read a translated transcript of what CA Mexican politicians say to spanish language outlets like Univision or La Opinion.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Too White, Too Male</p>
<p>The same point could be made in several different ways. </p>
<p>Perhaps the nation (or the voting populace) is &#8220;too black&#8221; and &#8220;too female.&#8221; </p>
<p>Maybe blacks and females are too enamored of socialism, abortion on demand, and wild-eyed political demagoguery such as we find in the current rulers. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s true that the vast majority of Republicans are white.  But rather than realize that the solution to their shrinking share of the population is to stop flooding the country with non-white immigrants, the Stupid Party has come to the conclusion that they have to join the Democrats in wanting to keep increasing immigration, giving amnesty to illegal immigrants, and favoring affirmative action, all in a fruitless effort to gain the votes of non-whites.  Face it, given a choice, the non-whites will always vote for the true anti-white party, the Democrats.</p>
<p>It would also be a good idea to not favor a totally unnecessary war just because an idiot Republican started it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Did non-whites ever vote Republican?&#8221;  Yes, Mr. Denver.  In the period following the civil war, blacks supported the party of Lincoln.  However, when FDR created the modern welfare state of America, blacks switched to supporting the Democrats. </p>
<p>Of course, that was not really a switch at all: they consistently voted for whoever promised them the biggest chunk of the white man&rsquo;s pie, as do all other non-whites.   As will they ever.  Self-interest is natural law, and race matters. </p>
<p>This weak, sniveling: &#8220;What can we do to get them to like us?&#8221; trend is as disgusting for its weakness as for its ignorance.  They never did, they never will.  Nature&rsquo;s rules.</p>
<p>The line: &#8220;It&rsquo;s become a white man&rsquo;s party&#8221; is not an accurate assessment, because it suggests an increase in white involvement, and/or an increase in the concern for white people on the part of the party, neither of which is true. This is in no small part because of whites who abandon the party rather than fight for their own interest.</p>
<p>Both major parties were very white through most of their history.  This reflected the population as a whole.  Until very recently, thanks to the Kennedy (D!!) immigration reform act of &#8216;65. </p>
<p>It would be more accurate to say that &#8220;It&rsquo;s become the last refuge of the white man in American politics.  It is the last remaining place where the white man may have a significant voice. &#8221;  This is changing, too, as disappointed whites abandon ship (rather than take the wheel) and allow those with the same program of pandering to non-whites to take control.  It is being targeted, and those who should fight are fleeing. </p>
<p> I can&rsquo;t believe the number of times I&rsquo;ve heard the sentiment: &#8220;To hell with the Republicans, because they aren&rsquo;t paying enough attention to the concerns of white people. They&rsquo;ve sold us out!&#8221;    Gee, why doesn&rsquo;t the party leadership pay more attention to these &#8220;supporters&#8221;?   And just who do these steadfast defenders of the white race think WILL do more for us?  Or at the least, do less harm, giving us greater chances to get the country moving in the right direction-   Obama? The party of Ted Kennedy?  <br>
As Dr. Phil might say: &#8220;How&rsquo;s that working for ya?&#8221;   </p>
<p>The Democrats have clearly gone way beyond rejecting representing whites, to oppressing and dispossessing them in favor of any &amp; every-body else.  They are the champion sell-outs!  And they have been so for a long time. This article is really about how the Republican party is under pressure to do the same, and there are indications that it is sitting on the fence.  It is up to white people themselves to see to it that the GOP comes down on their side. <br>
 Again: nature&rsquo;s rules.  No one else will, and the party itself is a merely a political beast: it must be tamed, trained and put to work.   Whoever will sit on his hands has no right to complain about what they will be full of.  </p>

<p>The cubans should not have been allowed into America. The cubans transformed miami into utterly corrupt spanish speaking country. The Cold War may turn out to be a death sentetnce for Native Born White America&hellip;.may as in very high probability. Native Born White Americans foolishly went along with the Cold War&hellip;they are now going to live to regret it. America could have lived in peace with Cuba. Vdare.com should have focused on the cubans im miami with a laser beam like focus. What happened down in Miami is a powerfull indictment of US immigration policy. Despite thee has been 0 commentary on vdare.com about the cuban occupation and take over of Miami.</p>
<p>If you voted for Ronald Reagan, you voted for the race-relacement of Native Born White Americans. The Cubans are not our kind.<br>

<p>&#8220;Black&#8221; Insurgent, white males are losing because we play by the rules and pull our own weight in an orderly and reliable fashion. All those who are less able, less organized, less reliable, and less intelligent rely on white male tax monies to fund their lives through welfare, Club Fed vacations a/k/a prison, protected legal status in the workplace, preferential access to all kinds of grants, programs, and education. Not to mention the peace and tranquility that comes from living in a white created law abiding society. </p>
<p>The more incompetent blacks and browns that flood white institutions, the greater the strain on the white male taxpayers who make it all possible. The house can only bear so much of that load before it all comes falling down.  </p>

<p>Posted by Black Insurgent at 12:17 AM on May 20 </p>
<p>Whites are failing POLITICALLY and now economically because only they of all the people on earth, evolved high enough to have compassion for others not like them.  They gave into complainers like you.  The devolopment of Christian &#8220;ethics&#8221; caused it and continues to be the bane of White Europeans everywhere.</p>
<p>Africa, like Japan has not encountered problems of world opinion as it drives Whites and other &#8220;non-natives&#8221; out of their indigenous lands.  Only Whites have allowed a guilt complex to overcome their biological urge for tribal survival.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the British Empire went out into the world to play cricket with all peoples, but then those people figured out that they could win by violating the rules.  As Rudyard Kipling illustrated, good intentions sure to fail.</p>
<p>My having to &#8220;esplain&#8221; that you to proves that Whites are still superior. </p>
<p>What will the future be like?  Since you cannot fathom that, or read enough to envision the world without Whites, that is, White intellectualism - I suggest you do the culturally dominant chore of renting a movie that makes it easy for the lazy to comphrehend it, if in a non-intellectual way.  Rent the film &#8220;Idiocracy.&#8221; </p>

			<p>This is what is wrong with the Republican party leadership. They don&rsquo;t really believe in the basic beliefs of the party.  They really believe the Democrats and they try to follow them in every way.  Republicans have to get over this and understand the principles of their party which is supposed to be about small government and low taxation as well as strong defense.</p>

			<p>I think one thing that we all have to remember is that the journalist of today is an ersatz burger flipper in real life. They excel in nothing except praise of black americans no matter how nominal, and degrading whites no matter how exceptional. <br>
The brainwashed journalist don&rsquo;t even know what they are doing. </p>

			<p>This issue really has nothing to do with either political party per se, the real issue is the sustainability of a democratic republic experiencing large demographic changes over a short period of time.  If history is any indicator, the country faces grim days ahead.  </p>

			<p>Perhaps if the Democrats haven&rsquo;t been denouncing Republicans as racists for all these years, then some nonwhite voters who believe in the same common sense things that the Republicans believe would be attracted to the Republican side.  But when the Democrats keep the &#8220;racist&#8221; name calling all the time, the sensible Asians, Hispanics, Blacks etc. shy away from the Republican party.  The Republicans should call the Democrats on that.</p>

			<p>&#8220;State GOP&rsquo;s Problem? Too White, Too Male&#8221;</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same problem the mass media has.  After 40 years of taking care of every possible group but the White heterosexual male, the Republicans are shocked, shocked that the White males don&rsquo;t turn out for them.</p>
<p>I agree that the Republicans are doomed.  The last leader was Ronald Reagan.  He was a lifelong leader in the battle against communism starting in the 1930&rsquo;s when he was involved in exposing the communists in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>But in domestic affairs, Reagan was as anti White as every President since Truman.  He promised to get rid of Carter&rsquo;s Department of Education.  he didn&rsquo;t.  The DofE has been the leader in anti White propaganda since then.  Reagan did nothing about affirmative action.  He could have ended it with a few executive orders.</p>
<p>Let the Republicans die.  They have done nothing to save me and mine from the extermination affirmative action no Whites need apply agenda of the Democrats.<br>

			<p>Let the GOP die and its carcass rot.  Back in the 1850s, the Whig Party died.  The Republican Party was built on its ruins, with many of the same characters.  The reshuffling did allow a relative newcomer to rise to the top, and the War Between the States resulted.  Hopefully, we can do better than Lincoln in any reconstituted right wing party, replacing the likes of McCain and Spector with some activists.</p>

			<p>White male? Like Sarah Palin?  Let&rsquo;s just call it white, huh?  Granted, Palin was a shill for The Lobby and El Lobby just as McCain was but at least there was a white woman out on the front lines to counter the &#8220;ugly women&#8221; politics of the Dems.  I never understood how half the female population could turn on one of their own so fast and so viciously.  We need our white women to be with us in the struggle.  Let&rsquo;s not let GOP sabateurs divide us!</p>
