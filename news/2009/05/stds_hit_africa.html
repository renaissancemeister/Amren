<h1>STDs Hit African-Americans at Higher Rate</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Templeton, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2008, 49 of 89 cases of syphilis in Allegheny County [Pennsylvania], or more than 60 percent of all cases, involved African-Americans, who make up 13.5 percent of the county population.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, about 1,585 of 2,164 cases of gonorrhea last year (or 73.3 percent of the county total) and 3,070 of 5,206 cases of chlamydia (about 60 percent of the total) also involved African-Americans.</p>
<p>Regarding HIV/AIDS, 52 of 92 cases countywide in 2008, or 56 percent of the total, involved African-American citizens.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, already working to address the national problem of disproportionately high numbers of STD cases among African-Americans, describes the task as &#8220;a daunting undertaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;STD disparities reflect socioeconomic disparities, which in turn reflect deep-rooted racial inequalities that continue to exist and are metastasized throughout American society,&#8221; states a CDC overview on STD prevention.</p>
<p>Last year, the CDC said, nearly half of all young African-American teenage females, aged 14 to 19, were infected with an STD, compared with 20 percent of young white females.</p>
<p>STD totals statewide, based on 2007 numbers, also show racial disparity in the number of African-Americans with infections. About 52 percent of all chlamydia cases, 65 percent of all gonorrhea cases and 51 percent of all syphilis cases in the state involve African-Americans, who make up 10 percent of the state population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To reduce STDs, local health officials also must address other problems affecting the minority population to break down social barriers and earn its trust.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people at highest risk are the most socially and emotionally isolated, and they are suspicious,&#8221; Dr. Smith [Walter H. Smith, executive director of Family Resources of Allegheny County] said. &#8220;There is an increased rate of STD in their community? Surprise! Surprise! We&rsquo;re not reaching them.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>STDs hit African-Americans at a higher rate because promiscuous unprotected sexual behavior hits African-Americans at higher rate. </p>
<p>from the article: &ldquo;STD disparities reflect socioeconomic disparities, which in turn reflect deep-rooted racial inequalities that continue to exist and are metastasized throughout American society,&rdquo; states a CDC overview on STD prevention.</p>
<p>Deep-rooted racial inequalities? Would that be an outright admission of the IQ gap by the CDC as the root cause? </p>

		<p>Oh my! This data comes as a complete shock to me as I&rsquo;m sure it does to all readers! How is it possible that the most promiscuous and sexually irresponsible group of people on the face of the earth also have the highest rates of STD&rsquo;s? This same group also births 70%+ of its children out of wedlock. This is clearly the white mans fault.<br/>
At least African-Africans have the excuse of being overwhelmingly illiterate and subject to incompetent governments led by people who think that lemon peels will cure HIV. American society is bombarded on a daily basis with scientific facts about STD&rsquo;s and their spread. Its not possible for any American to claim that they were ignorant of these facts; that is unless its willful ignorance.</p>

<p>Translation: &#8220;I got syphilis because the white man is racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks will never have a chance of improving their condition until they take responsibility for their actions (which is unlikely so long as you can blame someone else).<br/>

		<p>Jews make up around 2 % of the USA&rsquo;s population, yet make up 100% of those afflicted with Tays-Sachs disease. Yet, one never hears Jews whining about &#8220;religious inequalities&#8221;, regarding Tays-Sachs. Why? Would they feel better if 80% of Tays-Sachs sufferers were Protestants or Catholics? Of course not?</p>
<p>Why is it so hard for the medical community to comprehend that STD&rsquo;s are diseases that can be prevented by behavioral modification, and that certain races are more susceptible to STDs, as a result of reckless and risky behavior? That would be akin to blacks developing trichinosis if they ate uncooked pork, compared to almost no Caucasians getting it; because the latter cook pork more thoroughly. This is a case of blacks developing tapeworms because of eating improperly cooked pork - a clearly risky behavior.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an even better illustration. Why does Kuru, or laughing sickness; affect only certain tribes in Papua New Guinea? Why are Italians, Irish, Brazilians, Japanese or Icelanders not affected by laughing sickness?</p>
<p>Because Italians, Irish, Brazilians, Japanese or Icelanders do not eat the raw brains of their enemies. </p>

  &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Nice try CDC. These disparities are a result of the reckless sexual behavior of African-Americans and nothing else. In fact, reckless sexual behavior is at the root of almost all disparities between Afican-Americans and other groups.</p>
<p>I wonder how many of the 20% of the young, white females with an STD received that STD from an African-American. What would be VERY revealing is releasing statistics on infection rates for black males and white males. I would not be suprised if it were on the order of 75% to 10%.</p>
<p>Just another objective set of data that demonstrates why interracial dating is a very bad idea.  <br/>

		<p>When I was a juvenile probation officer, practically every one of the black girls and many of the black boys detained in juvenile hall had some sort of STD.  Most of the girls were prostitutes, basically abused slaves of black pimps.  They were more in the 12 to 15 age range than the 16 to 18 year age range.</p>
<p>The Dr. used to joke that he was going to get some interns for their gynecology and urology rotations as there was more STDs in the juvenile hall clinic than any other facility in the area.</p>

		<p>Blacks have higher rates of STDs for the same reason gay men do: higher rates of promiscuity.  It is also the reason they have a 75 per cent illegitimacy rate.  Unless people are willing to address the REAL causes of societal problems the problems can never be solved.  When mean old whitey disappears, who do they blame it on then?<br/>

<p>STD&rsquo;s are often caused by unprotected promiscuous sex. These people are responsible for their own behavior and  need to chanage THEIR sexual behavior in order to stop or lower their STD rate. Surprise! Surprise!<br/>

		<p>Reading this article one would get the impression that behavior has no bearing whatsoever on STD rates. Of course no news service could publish an article saying so.

		<p>To help close the STD gap, white students will no longer be able to attend classes warning of STD&rsquo;s. Instead, white girls will be allowed to wear short shorts showing off nice thighs and calves, sleeveless shirts and even cut off jerseys showing as much smooth stomach muscle as possible to be ever inviting to the white males in an effort to close the gap. What isn&rsquo;t considered is that the rapes of white girls by black boys (can we say that either?) will increase and then there will be a mixed race baby gap that will need closed as well as an unpolitically correct rise in black prisoner population that will cause excessive whining also!</p>

		<p>No surprise here, (blacks are hugely over-represented in STD&rsquo;s) but the usual spin (&#8216;it&rsquo;s not their fault&rsquo; / &#8216;racism/inequality is to blame&rsquo;).</p>
<p>In fact blacks have much, much higher rates of STD&rsquo;s because they are much, much more promiscuous. Desire for immediate gratification, poor impulse control, irresponsibility and low I.Q.&rsquo;s are the real, but unadmitted, reasons.</p>

		<p>It never stops, does it?  We cannot state facts or proof of those who are considered a racial minority in this country anylonger, can we? Blacks have been promiscuous for eons. Africa is proof in and of itself. We are not to believe our own eyes and to question any lie will become against the law. We are almost there, as the &#8220;hate&#8221; crime laws have been put into to place to achieve this end. Ask yourself why they want to censor truths? To make a lie become a truth. </p>

		<p>The sentence: &ldquo;STD disparities reflect socioeconomic disparities, which in turn reflect deep-rooted racial inequalities that continue to exist and are metastasized (sic) throughout American society,&rdquo; is a great example of weasel words. Notice how the word <i>reflect</i> is used: in this context, it  means correlation, and if cornered the writer of the CDC overview would probably admit it. So the sentence transformed into non-PC English is: In the U.S., STD disparities correlate with socio economic disparities, which in turn correlate with race differences.</p>
<p>Of course, many readers will not get this meaning, instead they will get the impression that U.S. racial policies have caused the higher STD rates among Blacks. This is the impression the CDC wants to project.</p>

<p>My question to those in the CDC is, if socioeconomic factors are the reason for the astronomical levels of STD&rsquo;s in the Black community, why are there not twice as many in the White community, since there are twice as many Whites in poverty as there are Blacks?</p>
<p>Could it be that &#8220;socioeconomic factors&#8221; are nothing more than a convenient excuse put forth to avoid revealing the true reasons for the disparity?</p>

		<p>That blacks have very high rates of STD&rsquo;s is not in the least bit surprising to anyone who has spent any time around them or interacting with them. Only the most naive, clueless people who have never been around blacks would find this in anyway surprising.</p>
