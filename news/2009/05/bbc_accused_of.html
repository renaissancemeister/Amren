			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Shipman, Daily Mail (London), May 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>BBC bosses were last night accused of going soft on the far-Right British National Party.</p>
<p>Campaigners and MPs said news chiefs were guilty of a &#8216;whitewash&rsquo; for delaying a programme investigating the group&rsquo;s extremist views until after next month&rsquo;s European elections.</p>
<p>The June 4 poll could see the party gain seats in the Brussels Parliament for the first time.</p>
<p>The programme, produced by BBC Wales, investigates a senior BNP activist with links to the South African security services.</p>
<p>The shelved investigation, being produced by BBC Wales, features Arthur Kemp, the South African head of  BNP election distribution, who was arrested following the murder of anti-apartheid activist Chris Hani, in 1993.</p>
<p>Although subsequently released, Kemp admitted producing a list of names of prominent ANC activists that was found at the home of one of Hani&rsquo;s killers.</p>
<p>Searchlight is also angry that a Newsnight report titled &#8216;the rising power of the BNP&rsquo; broadcast last week concluded: &#8216;It looks like a more moderate BNP courting voters this spring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The programme failed to mention that Clive Jefferson one of the BNP activists it interviewed was arrested two years ago for an alleged public order offence, following a complaint from a member of the public that he had been threatening and abusive whilst distributing BNP literature.</p>
<p>A second BNP figure featured in the report, Martin Wingfield, was arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in 1985 under the Race Relations Act, following distribution of racist literature.</p>
<p>His criminal record was not mentioned either and BNP Deputy Leader Simon Darby advised his members to watch the broadcast, claiming it was, &#8216;not a bad piece overall&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The anti-fascist group Searchlight yesterday called for an explanation as to why it would not be shown earlier.</p>
<p>The group claimed the BBC were &#8216;being played like fools&rsquo; for treating the BNP like &#8216;any other political party&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;If the BBC want to cover the BNP that&rsquo;s fine, but they have to challenge them and properly expose their agenda of prejudice and hate,&rsquo; a Searchlight spokesman added.</p>
<p>The BNP&rsquo;s leader Nick Griffin has already been offered a one to one chat with the BBC interviewer Andrew Marr if his party acquires its first MEP.</p>
<p>Senior Labour MP Jon Cruddas joined the outcry, writing to BBC News director Helen Boaden.</p>
<p>&#8216;Membership of the BNP is proscribed in a number of public sector organisations, such as the police and the prison service,&rsquo; he wrote. He added that &#8216;their activists were featured, but not challenged&rsquo; by the BBC.</p>
<p>A BBC spokesman said the programme was always meant to be shown after the elections and denied the corporation failed to scrutinise the BNP.<br>

		<p>And the Daily Mail is that much more credible when dealing with the BNP?  The Mail = Tory Party.  The Mail, like me, does not believe the CW that BNP draws all its blood from Labor, and that the BNP just might draw enough blood away from the Tories to keep Tories from flipping enough constituencies away from Labor so that the Mail&rsquo;s precious David Cameron won&rsquo;t be PM.</p>

I&rsquo;m sure that this has never happened to a member of any other political party in the UK.</p>

		<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been trying to find some anti-bnp viewpoints on the internet that are not in some way connected to searchlight, and it&rsquo;s been immensely difficult.  </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t understand why people who dislike the BNP associate themselves with searchlight, it&rsquo;s like defeating their cause before they&rsquo;ve even started.  The founders and people who run searchlight are ex-cons, communists and have been caught lying multiple times.  One of which cost the BBC (and by extension the british taxpayer) one million pounds.  Of course the BBC is at fault for giving these loons the time of day, and trusting their &#8220;research&#8221; (which was entirely fabricated), but that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that they lost an immense amount of taxpayer money.</p>
<p>Any newspaper that quotes Searchlight and tries to show them in anything but a negative light should be ignored.  As Simon Darby said, the only thing you can believe about british newspapers is the price.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the BBC is concerned that showing the BNP as a &#8220;racist&#8221; organization before the election would increase their share of the votes?</p>

		<p>No political party is responsible for acts its members or activists committed long ago. If it were otherwise, the party would be obliged to check the background of everybody who wants to join it -birth certificate, marital status, sexual orientation, professional morals, criminal record etc. Since a private organisation does not have access to these data, and rightly so, it cannot be held responsible.<br>
Another point: of the three cases mentioned, two cases are thought crimes &#8220;distributig racist literature&#8221; and &#8220;public order offence &hellip;distributing BNP literature&#8221;. You need a totalitarian mindset to see there a crime or a misdemeanour.</p>

&#8220;&lsquo;If the BBC want to cover the BNP that&rsquo;s fine, but they have to challenge them and properly expose their agenda of prejudice and hate,&rsquo; a Searchlight spokesman added.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
As the (rather fascistic) &#8220;antifascists&#8221; at Searchlight very well know, the BBC or ANY OTHER MSM covering the BNP has NOT been &#8220;fine&#8221;   &mdash;   it has been the OFFICIAL POLICY of the UK&rsquo;s National Union of Journalists! The NUJ rulebook spells this out very clearly: &#8220;The BNP will be covered either negatively or not at all.&#8221; </p>
<p>So the very fact that the BBC (of all places!) is giving a more-or-less balanced look at this party is itself an historic first! I&rsquo;ve been predicting cracks in the Cordon Mediatique (hat-tip: Vlaams Belang) that has banned the BNP from British airwaves up till now. Now prepare for the floodgates to open   &mdash;   meaning that, yes, the media will finally treat BNP as &#8220;just another political party&#8221; rather than as something the reporter found under a rock. </p>
<p>So when Searchlight says journalists covering the BNP &#8220;have to challenge them and properly expose their agenda of prejudice and hate,&#8221; what they&rsquo;re REALLY saying is that they&rsquo;re upset that the BBC has failed to live up to the NUJ guidelines by giving BNP coverage without superimposing devil horns and tails onto their spokespersons or otherwise demonizing them, slandering them, portraying them as skinhead thugs, and generally LYING about this brave and unabashedly British young party. </p>
<p>A party that will, I predict, win not only one seat in next month&rsquo;s EUros but several. Maybe even a half-dozen. June 4 can&rsquo;t come soon enough for me. </p>
<p>Any AmRen reader, of any nationality, who has never visited BNP&rsquo;s elaborate and highly professional-looking website, please do so: </p>
<p><a href="https://bnp.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">https://bnp.org.uk/</a></p>
<p>They enjoy hearing from sympathetic Americans and others. And if you REALLY like what you see, you might even drop a few pennies in their tip-jar toward their June 4 fund. </p>

		<p>If you click on bnp.org.uk one of their news items on the front page states that up to 2 million unemployed Romanians have been approved by the European Union to enter England because they are impoverished!  Oh - my - gosh!  Isn&rsquo;t &#8220;Romanian&#8221; often used as PC codespeak for &#8220;gypsy&#8221;?  It is obvious the EU wants to destroy England, utterly and completely.  I guess it isn&rsquo;t happening fast enough so the EU is picking up the pace.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Searchlight&#8221; is in fact a Communist Party of Great Britain front organisation, whose leader stook as a COGB candidate in 1962 when the Soviet Union was at its height   &mdash;   invading Czechoslavakia, suppressing dmeocracy etc. etc.   Seems like nohting chnages.<br>
Searchlight works closely with the SPLC in the USA, birds of a feather etc.<br>

		<p>The BNP is a legally constituted Political Party.</p>
<p>It exists to protect and defend the rights of indiginous Britons within the British Isles.</p>
<p>This is a right upheld by the UN - indiginous peoples have rights.</p>
<p>In the UK only ethnic minorities have rights.</p>
<p>If the British stand up for themslves they are branded &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>If ethnic minorities stand up for themselves they are &#8220;celebrated&#8221;.</p>
<p>Institionalised racism exists in the UK. It is directed against the indiginous peoples.</p>
<p>Membership of the BNP means that you can lose your job, your social standing and your liberty.</p>
<p>The British Government is a Marxist cabal - soon to be swept from power.</p>

		<p>This &#8216;Searchlight&rsquo; magazine is a terrible thing full of gobble-de-gook and non recyclable rubbish. There is hardly a modicum of truth in it but plenty of links to other websites that do not stand up to scrutiny. And as for Gerry Gable, just look him up on Wikipedia. It is rumoured that he is paid a pittance by another UK political party just to keep going and make the most outrageous claims but it&rsquo;s a waste of time suing him, he&rsquo;s broke. The UK media are very wary of reproducing any of his material as they have been sued, lost, and paid out a fortune in the past.</p>

		<p><i>A second BNP figure featured in the report, Martin Wingfield, was arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in 1985 under the Race Relations Act, following distribution of racist literature.</i></p>
<p>I have no doubt that <i>American Renaissance</i> is counted as &#8220;racist literature&#8221; and banned under Great Britain&rsquo;s Race Relations Act.  For that matter I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Murray and Hernstein&rsquo;s <i>The Bell Curve</i> is also in violation of the Race Relations Act.  It is sad to see the totalitarianism that diversity has brought to the once free country of Great Britain.</p>
<p><i>Although subsequently released, Kemp admitted producing a list of names of prominent ANC activists that was found at the home of one of Hani&rsquo;s killers.</i></p>
<p>So, if somebody mentioned in the SPLC&rsquo;s <i>Intelligencer</i> is later found murdered, can we blame Morris Dees for the crime?<br>
