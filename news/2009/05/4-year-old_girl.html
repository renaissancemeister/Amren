<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Josie Bluhm, 4, was in a 2007 Chrysler Town &amp; Country driven by her mother when the crash occurred. Her mother&rsquo;s minivan was southbound on 180th Street about 7:25 a.m. Tuesday when a 2007 Ford F-150 pickup driven west on West Center Road by Eleazar Rangel-Ochoa, 27, ran a red light and slammed into it, authorities said.</p>
<p>Josie was the most severely hurt of those injured in the crash. She suffered brain hemorrhaging and was eventually declared brain dead. Life support was withdrawn, and she died of her injuries at 5:50 p.m. today, police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rangel-Ochoa, whom police arrested after he was treated for his injuries, remained in jail today, accused of driving with a suspended license. He is not in the U.S. legally, according to police; they did not know his country of origin.</p>
<p>Authorities said Rangel-Ochoa&rsquo;s license had been suspended and revoked numerous times for offenses ranging from failure to complete driver improvement classes to driving under the influence. In 2003 his driver&rsquo;s license was revoked for 15 years following a conviction for third-offense DUI. He now will face a charge of misdemeanor motor vehicle homicide, Sgt. Doug Klein said in a police press release.</p>

			<p>This guy is breaking the law by being here, who in their right mind expects him to stop driving because of a suspended license?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking capital punishment.</p>

			<p>My word, could you imagine that was your child? My sincerest condolences to the parents of this little angel.</p>
<p>This is a situation that could be TOTALLY avoided! If our immigration laws were enforced. America is on the verge of lawlessness and anarchy over this.</p>
<p>I truly hope the parents sue the STATE for allowing this invasion to occur unimpeded. What a beautiful little girl that will never grow up, get married and have lots of babies! This is just plain wrong. </p>
<p>And why is it that every time an illegal kills an American via a car accident due to drunk driving or just not being able to drive at all because of a lack of English and understanding basic American traffic law that the person is usually of the white race? WHY? I do realize that illegals have killed other races via car accidents as well, it just seems like the white race is much higher in numbers. </p>
<p>US Constitution - Article IV - Section 4.</p>
<p>The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened) against domestic violence.<br>

			<p>HOW did he get a legal driver&rsquo;s license and what social security number was he working under, WHO hired him, WHY was he not in jail in the first place, WHY was he even in the U.S. WHY was HE not killed or crippled in the crash. There is NO justice, and god will not help us, as usual.</p>

			<p>In some states this would amount to 2nd degree murder.  This is based on the concept of &#8220;implied malice&#8221;. California, amoung many other states, have this law.   The implied malice is based on the person&rsquo;s overall driving record, including DUI&rsquo;s and driving on suspended license.   Despite the very bad driving record and suspended license, the person continues to drive&hellip;that is implied malice.  In California and probably other states the sentence would be 15 years to life.  Sounds like this guy qualifys./<br>

			<p>As the father of a blond, blue eyed five-year-old girl this story breaks my heart and enrages me at the same time. Just last year in Minnesota an illegal ran a stop sign and plowed into a school bus killing about six elementary school kids, all white except for an Asian adoptee. She lied about who she was and it was determined she had a stolen identity. These are not isolated incidents. They are part of a nationwide pattern that we are not allowed to address and our government at every level is complicit in these deaths. I wish I could win the lottery so I could spend my time compiling all of these tragedies and then dropping it in the lap of La Raza and all the rest.</p>

			<p>What is the price this illegal mexican alien will pay for taking the life of this little white girl, injuring her mother, and destroying her family? Though there is a $1 million bail set on him, he faces only 1 year in jail for killing this little white girl!!!! The state, on the other hand, is upset because he has 4 other dui&rsquo;s and was driving with a suspended liscense. He faces up to 4 years for those violations for a total of 5 years for all charges. The federal and state governments should be severely taken to task for this travesty of justice. If either one of them had done their respective jobs and arrested and deported this drunken alien animal little Josie Bluhm would be alive today. </p>

			<p>How can you get your license suspended multiple times? I got caught without insurance once and going to court sure scared me straight. I don&rsquo;t understand how something like that couldn&rsquo;t have an effect on people. </p>

			<p>Just remember that the reason that so many illegal aliens are here driving around and being a threat to everyone is because of all the many politicians you&rsquo;ve elected who are sell-outs for the Mexican &amp; other minority vote - the last few presidents included. Enforcing our immigration laws and keeping the borders secure are things they just pretend concern but about which they have done little or nothing for many decades. Your congressmen know they can just pacify you with the earmark goodies they bring in and just get re-elected anyway. For these sellouts It&rsquo;s all about getting re-elected and that little girl is just part of the cost.</p>

			<p>&#8220;He now will face a charge of misdemeanor motor vehicle homicide, Sgt. Doug Klein said in a police press release.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Misdemeanor???&#8221;  He kills a little girl, and it&rsquo;s a misdemeanor?  </p>
<p>Surely that&rsquo;s a misprint.  The charge in other states would be &#8220;Reckless Homocide,&#8221; or &#8220;Involuntary Manslaughter,&#8221;<br>
both felonies that would give him several years hard time.</p>
<p>This is really hard to believe.  I&rsquo;ve read reports of drivers driving on a suspended driver&rsquo;s licenses getting a couple years in prison, without even injuring anybody.  But they were white, so that&rsquo;s probably why.</p>
<p>Surely this information is incorrect.  <br>

			<p>This is a <i>misdemeanor</i> homicide?!  Historically those were crimes were the criminal served a year or less time.  Nebraska will lock him up, and then turn him loose to drive in Omaha again?  </p>

			<p>We spent years to finally(!) get drunk drivers off the road, making good headway I might add, and now we have a whole other clueless population group who are not on the same page bringing us back to probably the same high number of alcohol-related deaths of years past. Talk about a giant step backwards. Are there numbers to reflect this? A real shame for such a beautiful child. </p>

			<p>After a third DUI, an illegal alien gets a 15 year suspension of driving privileges, kills an American when he blows a red light, and is charged with MISDEMEANOR homicide?  <br>
     Exactly what does a foreign criminal have to do to get expelled, kill someone?</p>

			<p>When thousands more American citizens have been killed by illegal aliens, as they regrettably will be, as millions of more illegal aliens are &#8220;allowed&#8221; to enter the United States with impunity,(thanks to the many traitors to the U.S. citizenry in Congress), Amnesty and illegal immigration will become a moot topic. As people on this post so well know, the demographics will make it so.</p>

			<p>Here on eastern Long Island the local paper publishes arrests for the week. Seventy five percent of the driving while intoxicated arrests are hispanics,(illegals). The same percentage is in the paper for driving without a license. Apparently these things are no big deal where they come from. </p>

			<p>Omaha just held its mayor election and Hal Daub the Republican lost by a few thousand votes.  He opposed allowing Omaha to become a sanctuary city while the Dimocrat Jim Suttle said he didnt know what a sanctuary cit was.  Since Suttle won we are in for another 4 years of ignorant city non-leadership on immigration.</p>

			<p>WHY are our Washington legislators afraid to take action against illegal immigration? Where does their loyalty belong? To criminal illegal aliens (and the pro-immigrant lobbying groups)&hellip; or to the American citizens and voters?</p>
<p>(Don&rsquo;t bother answering this rhetorical question&hellip; we already KNOW the answer.) Unless the American citizens take appropriate action, the immigration problem will never be solved.</p>

			<p>One of the bitter fruits of the Latin American swarm of the United States is the rise of drunk driving and the deaths resultant to illegal immigrants from south of the Rio Grande.  The Indians and Mestizos of Latin America have not developed a tolerance for alcohol as they have only been exposed to alcohol only for a few centuries as opposed to the thousands of years Europeans have imbibed.</p>
<p>In the end, Josie Bluhm&rsquo;s death can be laid at the feet of the Wall Street Journal, the Bush family, John McCain, the Weekly Standard, Lindsay Graham and almost the whole Left in its entirety.</p>

			<p> I hope the family sues the city/state/and the Feds for allowing this illegal to stay in this country after numerous deportable offenses. This government cares nothing about its people, only about its profit.<br>
 And in the future, all police/judges/federal authorities should be held accountable as accessory&rsquo;s to any illegal aliens crime after they did not report or deport that illegal individual.<br>
 5 years for killing an innocent American girl, after his long criminal track record&hellip; what a monstrous JOKE!!!! </p>

<p>Omaha just loves our illegals. You have to speak Spanish in order to work most any of the State jobs or private sector social service oriented jobs in Omaha. Suttle will likely make Omaha a sanctuary city, just as Dale alluded.</p>

			<p>Here is another story of Mexican behavior.  If he is an immigrant, the family should sue his employer.  Being 23 however, he may very well be an anchor baby.</p>

<p> <br>
Man Facing Rape Charges In Toddler Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>UPDATE: Oxnard Police have confirmed that Carlos Garcia Morales, 23-years-old of Oxnard is under arrest in connection with the kidnapping of Oxnard toddler.</p>
<p>Police say, Morales is facing charges of kidnapping to commit rape, Sexual intercourse or sodomy with a child 10 or under and burglary.</p>
<p>Detectives working the case believe that Morales acted alone and is the only person responsible for the crime. </p>
<p>The young girl was returned to her parents late Friday morning.</p>
<p><br>
Oxnard, CA  &mdash;   Police are trying to piece together what happened early Friday morning, when a man allegedly kidnapped a 1-year-old girl from her family&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>Police say an intensive manhunt was on after the girl&rsquo;s parents reported a man came into their home, and took the baby girl from their bed while sleeping.</p>
<p>Immediately Oxnard Police with the assistance of the Ventura County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department began a street by street search on foot. The Sheriff&rsquo;s Department helicopter was called in to search from above.</p>
<p>According to police, the child was taken from a home on the 100 block of S. McKinley Road. Three hours into their search officers discovered the suspect and child in a car just a 3/4 of a mile from her home on McKinley.</p>
<p>David Keith with the Oxnard Police Department told KEY News an individual is in custody and is currently being questioned by investigators. He also went on to say, &#8220;this is one of the worst cases he has seen in the last 25 years.&#8221;</p>
