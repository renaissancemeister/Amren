			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), May 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Scotland Yard is scaling down its use of controversial powers which allow officers to stop and search people without reasonable grounds for suspicion.</p>
<p>Stung by criticism that the practice has alienated ethnic minorities, the Metropolitan Police is changing its policy on when Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 can be employed.</p>
<p>In future its use will be restricted to policing &#8216;iconic&rsquo; or strategically important sites, such as Buckingham Palace and Parliament, and to specific operations.</p>
<p>In other cases officers will be told to use Section 43 of the Act, which requires them to have reasonable suspicion that the person they are stopping is a terrorist.</p>
<p>The Met increased its use of the Section 44 powers following the car bomb attacks on a nightclub in Haymarket, Central London, and Glasgow Airport in June 2007.</p>
<p>Since October of that year the force has carried out 154,293 stop and searches.</p>
<p>But Government figures released last week showed that black and Asian people were targeted disproportionately.</p>
<p>Assistant Commissioner John Yates, who took over as the force&rsquo;s anti-terror chief last month, highlighted the concerns in a recent report to the Met Police Authority.</p>
<p>He wrote: &#8216;The power is seen as controversial and has the potential to have a negative impact, particularly on minority communities.&rsquo;<br>

			<p>&#8220;Officers Stripped of Stop and Search Terror Powers Over Fears of Angering Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a shame that Muslims are unable to create a civilization themselves and must come to Western countries to find work.  And it is a further shame that their own ruling elites want them out of their own countries, because they regard them as dead wood that can&rsquo;t provide for themselves.</p>
<p>We should be conducting studies and having polls to try to determine just why these countries are such abject failures, because most of them are wealthy from the trillions of oil revenues they receive.  It certainly must have to do with their incompetence as a people.</p>
<p>Can we be blamed every time we see a non-white in a white country we think of incompetence and failure, since even their own governments don&rsquo;t want them?</p>

<p>Keep in mind here that when the British use the term &#8220;Asian&#8221; they do not mean Phillipines, Japan, China or Thailand. They mean Pakistani, Indian, Bangladeshi, Sri-Lanka and such and basically all muslims.</p>

			<p>To &#8220;truth&#8221;:</p>
<p>Muslim immigration to the First World is not driven by the economic or governmental incompetence of currently Muslim nations. It is driven by the desire of Muslims to colonise and subjugate the entire world.</p>

			<p>Reply to Johnny English:</p>
<p>What you say is true but I would add the real enablers are the treason lobby of marxist-liberals who let them in and betray their own people. In the U.K. this would be the Labour party.</p>

<p>Absolutely correct, there is no room for any, ANY!!! non muslim <br>
in a muslim dominated world, Christians are NOT taking the muslim threat seriously enough. I have also preached to the military about the danger of the Taliban/AQ getting Paki nukes and was pooh-poohed, NOW LOOK AT THEM SWEAT and THREAT!!</p>

<p>While I agree that Muslims who migrate to other societies desire to take over their host countries, the impetus to relocate is definitely one that has to do with living under a regime in an environment that is so backward and poor they want to get out.</p>
<p>Like the Mexicans here who are from a society that is so corrupt they have no legitimate government, because their officials don&rsquo;t have the intelligence to create a successful society, and even if they did they couldn&rsquo;t do it anyway because the vast majority of their elites are on the drug cartel payrolls.</p>
<p>So, instead, they come here waving the flag from their failed country on flag poles and in their work places, advocating free entry for every other Mexican still there in Mexico, claiming that this land is their land and we should go back to Europe, even though our ancestors built and settled this nation over a period of about 500 years.</p>
<p>The Muslims and all the other third world rabble are exactly the same, with slight varying differences.</p>
<p>The Mexican intent, of course, just like the Muslims, is to &#8220;steal&#8221; a successful country, because that&rsquo;s the only way they&rsquo;ll ever get one they can call their own.</p>
