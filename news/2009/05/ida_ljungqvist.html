<p>Along with the title of 50th Playmate of the Year, the 27-year-old (who was previously know as Miss March 2008) was given $100,000 in prize money, a new Mazda6 car, and a big bottle of Patron.</p>

			<p>She&rsquo;s about as black as &#8220;The Rock,&#8221; which is to say just a trace.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very misleading to read an article about a black this or that, then turn to the photo and see someone who is obviously mostly non-black.</p>
<p>When is the census and the media going to start another &#8220;mixed race&#8221; category to keep us from being fooled all the time when no photo is available?</p>
<p>Incidentally, this woman is really nothing exceptional.</p>

			<p>Finally!</p>
<p>At long last, a Playmate all African women can look up to &amp; emulate as one of their own!</p>
<p>Light brown skin, straight light-brown hair, narrow nose, flat face, yes, just what comes to mind whenever one thinks of native Tanzanian women.</p>
<p>And that name!</p>
<p>Ida Ljungqvist - surely in the months to come we&rsquo;ll hear of many black babies named after this role model, and they will grow up strong and proud with such a noble Afrocentric moniker!</p>

			<p>Isn&rsquo;t it funny how she does not look black, but instead looks like she has a little black in her, with mostly European features, including the white invention of inmplants?</p>

			<p>hmmm&hellip;I wonder how many white parents and grandparents this &#8220;african&#8221; has.</p>
<p>Why is it that so many of the &#8220;africans&#8221; (especially females) who appear in sitcoms, commercials, movies, beauty pageants look like white women with suntans?</p>

			<p>What a historic year for Africans  Wow!!!!  Another example of black is beautiful. We can expect more of this in the coming future.  She has a Tanzanian mother and a Swedish father who met while he was working for UNICEF.  I  can&rsquo;t believe this man would marry  a pure african woman. She looks nothing like her blonde hair blue-eyed father, she looks like a typical blackwoman born here except she straightened her naturally curly hair. Another example of why not to race mix. </p>

			<p>Playboys magazine&rsquo;s  subscriptions are down they have to do something new.  They needed more diversity in their magazine. All the blonde white women look the same and they want to reach a wider ethnic audience. Men like a variety of different woman. No one wants to turn page after page to see the same woman over and over again.  There was a black actress on the cover recently.</p>

			<p>Get real, Hugh Hefner.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what color, or tint, she is.</p>
<p>It is all fantasy.</p>
<p>Fantasy piled on top of fantasy.</p>
<p>Fantasy leading to fantasy.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t know what a person is supposed to do with this.</p>
<p>What can you do with it?</p>

			<p>On top of her obviously NOT being a legitimately native Tanzanian, I smell an obvious fix here. Simply stated, as Playmates go, she just isn&rsquo;t all that attractive or special to look at. I don&rsquo;t say this as a racial thing, but just a straight-up aesthetic observation.   </p>

			<p>Where did she get that Swedish name? Not to mention the semi-Caucasian looks.  <br>
She&rsquo;s typical of East Africa?</p>
<p>Just as I think countries like Belgium and Germany should be represented by Belgians and Germans,   so I also believe that Africa should be represented by Africans. She is not a typical African.</p>

			<p>Whenever black women have decent hair, it&rsquo;s usually a weave. Ida is biracial, but can we really be certain her hair is natural? Are her breasts natural?</p>
<p>The artificial look is always unattractive - not to mention ludicrous. A black woman with decent hair is somehow even less alluring, because it&rsquo;s obvious she&rsquo;s wearing a weave. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what racial features a woman is going for, if it&rsquo;s artificial it&rsquo;s unappealing. Malcolm X used to chastise black men and women for straightening their hair, claiming they were ashamed of their blackness. Not only is artificiality unattractive, but when it&rsquo;s taken in a direction that leads away from one&rsquo;s race it indicates a lack of racial pride. There is nothing wrong, in my opinion, with a white woman getting a tan as a result of her everyday outdoor routine; it&rsquo;s when they systemically set out to tan themselves, whether by visiting a parlour or just laying out in the sun, that their actions become unsettling. And I find white women with milky white skin just as enticing, if not more so, than white women with tanned skin.</p>
<p>The extreme example of racial shame in the white community, in this regard, is when white women grease up their hair and dye it brown. It looks awful and it&rsquo;s absurd from the point of view of race.</p>
<p>Playboy&rsquo;s selection of Ida is not the first example of their promotion of artificiality. The standard, from the magazine&rsquo;s inception, was a tanned, bleached blond white woman with fake breasts. The &#8220;white&#8221; features the magazine promotes, such as bleached blond hair, looks unnatural and unappealing; the non-white features, like heavily bronzed skin, is foolish from a racial standpoint. Their selection of Ida with her fake breasts and (in all likelihood) horsehair weave continues Playboy&rsquo;s dimwitted legacy. Does anyone else here suspect multiculturalism as a contributing factor to the emergence of artificiality as the aesthetic standard?</p>

			<p>The half-breed mulatto look is becoming the look of America. Tiger Woods, Barack Obama, and now Playboy is following the trend. Most of the younger white generation growing up today have no clue of race, history, or white heritage. If you mention Black&rsquo;s meager contribution to western civilization they scream &#8220;stupid, ignorant&#8221;, too ignorant to realize that they are the ignorant ones. It may sound cliche, but I&rsquo;ll be glad that I wont be around 100 years from now, when the white race in America is nothing but a distant memory.</p>

			<p>She looks like our President`s sister. Anyone who thinks East Africans have anything in common with African Americans is victim of political correctness. Who would have ever thought she was anything except a hot chick with a tawny complexion.<br>
     We are on a vast guilt trip as white folks. These stories make us all feel the hastle we gave to our slaves has at last been expiated. Obama got about 5 million extra votes from whites who knew if they voted for him, they could forget their great great grand parents made fortunes in the slave trade and for over 150 years we made their children drink from seperate water coolers.<br>
     In a way this may be a good thing for blacks. We may well quit giving them government largess that destroys their families and stuffs them in prisons.<br>

<p>I believe they are.  Black women naturally tend to have more voluptuous bodies than women of other races. Big breasts even on small black women are very common.  I believe &gt;90 % of the  women in this magazine have implants and aren&rsquo;t naturally blonde and have blue or green eyes, or have full lips. The majority of these women are artificial and look ridiculous.</p>

			<p>Hugh Hefner is a pornographer buy any other name. It has always amazed and amused me,how he has been given a break on this status that he should have earned. </p>
<p>P.S. Sure I&rsquo;ve looked at Playboy Magazines, but that doesn&rsquo;t change the truth about old Heff.</p>

			<p>Give me a White woman anytime.  I still say the White woman is the most beautiful of all the races.  </p>
<p>As a matter of fact, whenever a non White woman is touted as being beautiful her beauty is judged by the degree to which it approximates and exemplifies White standards of beauty.</p>

<p>That will not happen anytime soon. African blacks almost literally worship their half-breed mongrels and know their simian like features do not fare well in international beauty contests.</p>
<p>One could only imagine the glee of this half-breed&rsquo;s mother marrying a white male. </p>
<p>A white spouse is the ultimate status symbol in Africa, meaning less uglier children and the ability to live abroad, and ironically, in the nicer parts of their native country. </p>

			<p>Looks like some white genes died in one of her parents.</p>
<p>Given this woman&rsquo;s last name, it appears that it was a white male who has wiped out his family line and devolved back to Africa via miscegenation.</p>
