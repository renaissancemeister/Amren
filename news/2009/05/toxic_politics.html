	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Here in northwest England, disenchantment could deliver a first European Parliament seat to the British National Party, a fierce critic of Islam that wants to pay non-Britons to leave the country, clamp down on immigration, restore capital punishment and take Britain out of the European Union and NATO.</p>
<p>{snip} In France, Greece and Germany the far-left is gaining ground, while in the Netherlands, Austria and Belgium, nationalist, anti-immigration, and anti-Muslim parties have the chance to prosper.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Over lunch in a Carlisle pub he even suggested that a western economic and energy crisis might bring the far-right into government. &#8220;The horrible possibility is that one comes to power elected to solve a totally unsolvable problem,&#8221; [Nick Griffin] said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the other hand, a good showing in the European elections would bring the B.N.P. closer to respectability, giving it more access to the news media, and funding  &mdash;  &#8220;a totally different ball game,&#8221; Dr. Goodwin [Matthew Goodwin, research fellow at Manchester University] said.</p>

			<p>And the far-left and the &#8220;far right&#8221; winning seats and respectability is supposed to be a bad thing?  It would be a good thing, because it would eviscerate the fraudulent middle, which has been drifting leftward for decades, no small part due to the New York Times.</p>
<p>During the height of the 2000 Presidential elections, Tim Russert had on PJB (Reform Party) and Ralph Nader (Green Party) to debate each other.  I remember Russert saying that this was in a sense, the real Presidential debate.  I agree, it was far more substantial than the tweedledee-tweedledum Gore-Bush &#8220;debates.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I can think of nothing better for Europe, and especially Britain, than to give some of these right wing parties a chance. I think if the BNP were to gain significant power the Brits would find out that the BNP is not at all the horrible racist monster its enemies try to make them out to be but rather a very conscientious non-sell out party worthy of respect (though hated by the illegal aliens and non-assimilating arrogant Muslims), maybe worthy even a BNP prime minister. They couldn&rsquo;t be nearly as bad as the corrupt sell-out 3-ird world immigrant welcoming Labour party the Brits have suffered under so long.</p>

			<p>Long time reader, first time commenter &hellip; No longer will concern over someone, who can do real damage, digging up and finding out my true political leanings in the future hold me back from voicing my/our concerns and speaking the truth&hellip;</p>
<p>Minus the title which tries to paint the BNP&rsquo;s views as &#8220;toxic&#8221;, I was surprised at the fair coverage this article gave in describing the BNP&rsquo;s views and activities. Stephen Castle seriously needs a pat on the back for this one (at the New York Times no less). THIS is true journalism: informative yet unpersuasive from a lack of opinion (loaded adjectives are usually the culprit) and all-encompassing in its reporting </p>

			<p>An enlightened, sensitive-type columnist recently brought up the image of Nazi&rsquo;s and World War Two when discussing the BNP. Taking his lead, maybe it&rsquo;s a responsible idea to bring up beheadings and the twin-towers every time the EU discusses immigration. And aren&rsquo;t they always offering up a forum for immigrants who have already made it into the country? </p>

			<p>Note that the countries with succesful rightist prties tend to have more immigrants.</p>
<p>But in Germany too, where things are less severe, anti-immigration sentiment is at an all time high.</p>
<p>The only people left in Europe who (seem to) believe in multiculturalism are professional multiculturalists &amp; a handful of far left kooks driven by hated of western civilization, not love of foreignors. </p>
<p>In their souls, Europeans hate the new diversity and would give anything to turn the clock back 35 years.<br>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;The horrible possibility is that one comes to power elected to solve a totally unsolvable problem,&rdquo; [Nick Griffin] said&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The BNP needs to pick up this one phrase by this idiot and run with it.  The problems ARE solvable, the BNP has the only answers that will save Britain.</p>
<p>The &#8216;totally unsolvable problem&rsquo; Griffen speaks of WILL be solved when the demographics of Britain change irrevocably and the &#8216;answers&rsquo; to any problems  WILL be punitively enforced through Sharia Law.</p>
<p>Professor Lynn writes on VDare.com (about this &#8216;unsolvable problem&rsquo; in Britain):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;white fertility rate is 1.6 children per woman, while blacks and the Indians have about 30 percent more children than whites at 2.2 and 2.3. The Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Somalis have 5.0, more than three times the number of children as whites.</p>
<p>We see that the numbers of non-Europeans are projected to reach around 15.5 million by 2031 and 70 mi1lion in 2061&hellip;.by 2061 about two thirds of the population of Britain will be of non-European origin, while about one third will be white. ..&#8221;</p>
<p>Seems like the BNP has the answers to the &#8216;problem&rsquo; (pay non-Britons to leave the country, clamp down on immigration, restore capital punishment and take Britain out of the European Union and NATO)  &mdash;  it already may be too late for native White Britons because of the differing birth rates.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d ask Griffin this:  M. Griffin,   what do you think YOUR native country will be like politically, legally, economically when low IQd, high birthrate Non-Whites take control of the country your ancestors  fiercely defended?</p>
<p>How to you think those &#8216;wonderfully diverse&rsquo; Third World known for violence against Whites will treat the small remaining White population?</p>
<p>Which monuments, museums, buildings do you think they&rsquo;ll start with when the non-White hoards tear down and obliterate every last vestige of British culture?</p>
<p>Oh, and don&rsquo;t worry about the death penalty  &mdash;  it will be fully implemented, even accelerated, starting with the remaining White Britons.</p>

			<p>These figures about reproductive rates of immigrants (legal and illegal) is going to be the base of figuring out WHEN they will outnumber Whites. The figures are WRONG because they only include the figures for the current KNOWN immigrants. There are MANY, MANY others the bean counters do not know about. The reproductive figures for the aliens in their own countries MUST be taken into account too since MANY,MANY of them will ALSO END UP IN ENGLAND/U.S. via some sort of immigration (legal or not) and the family connections of those already living off of the White taxpaying slave. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Bon, Tax Slave of the NWO,&#8221; what are you trying to say?  Nick Griffin and the BNP want non-British people out of Britain.  What&rsquo;s your problem with their policy?  Are they not extreme enough for you or do just not understand the article ?  Do you think Nick Griffin is unaware of what Sharia law is or the higher birthrates of minorities?  Nick Griffin has been involved in racial nationalism since the 1970&rsquo;s.  He doesn&rsquo;t need American internet nobodies incoherently scolding him.    </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s true. But &#8216;professional multiculturalists&rsquo; are also known as K-12 - and sunday school, teachers. Also known as HR hiring managers. The press are de facto professional multiculturalists as well.  </p>

<p>None. </p>
<p>Mea Culpa.</p>
<p>Sorry, I wrote the post hastily, didn&rsquo;t have time to check it and wrote Mr. Griffin&rsquo;s name instead of  other idiots who have promoted Third World immigration into Britain since the British Nationality Act of 1948 conferred the right of citizenship on all members of the British Commonwealth and Empire.</p>
<p>I am a HUGE fan of Nick Griffin and believe HE and the BNP may be the Last Great Hope of Britain. </p>
<p> Gordon Brown:</p>
<p>Rather than recognize the folly of outlawing &#8216;hate speech,&rsquo; he proposed even more oppressive laws:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; I think any preaching of religious or racial hatred will offend mainstream opinion in this country and I think we&rsquo;ve got to do whatever we can to root it out from whatever quarter it comes&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And this from Joe:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;He doesn&rsquo;t need American internet nobodies incoherently scolding him&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, better to have those high-powered writers at the London Times and government mouthpieces in the British MSM &#8216;incoherently&rsquo; have at him and get the word out.</p>
<p>Sorry, I will be sure to double-check my writings in the future.</p>

			<p>If there is such a thing as an Internet political revolution then the UK is going through one right now. Demonised as racists, illegally denied jobs in local government, police etc., by the mainstream media &amp; its vacuous celebrities, the whole political Establishment, the churches and just about everybody else, the perfectly legal British National Party has, for the first time in its history, been allowed the privilege of having a 5-minute party political broadcast aired on TV in the run-up to the Euro elections on June 4. With such treatment they should continue to be the racist nothings that the mainstream media have made them out to be. Incredibly, local elections &amp; opinion polls indicate that the BNP have gatecrashed the Lib/Lab/Con three-parties-with-one-name hold on UK voters, polling almost 30%, which, if translated into votes, will most definitely see them win seats in the neo-Marxist European Parliament. </p>
<p>This is equivalent in the USA to a party being led by say, David Duke, coming from nowhere in a year to poll 30% in opinion polls and local elections. The indigenous people of the UK have most definitely awakened from their long slumber. Thanks to the Internet and word-of-mouth, the &#8216;Fascist&rsquo; &#8216;Racist&rsquo; lies no longer work and only make the Lib/Lab/Con politicians appear as fools and liars. Also helping, is the fact that the Daily Telegraph newspaper is gradually, a few each day, releasing the names and details of the MPs caught up in the expenses fraud where the majority of MPs have been defrauding the taxpayers over expenses by claiming for mortgages that don&rsquo;t exist, and everything else, including the kitchen sink. The politicians are now running scared of the people and that can&rsquo;t be bad. This has helped the BNP David square up to the Lib/Lab/Con Goliath and the BNP are now seen as bearers of the truth and, incredibly, now hold the moral high ground. What a turnaround. While the Lib/Lab/Con politicians are seen as the traitors and criminals that they undoubtedly are.</p>
<p>All UK parties are pro-EU except the BNP. UKIP, which already has EU seats, is increasingly seen as an Establishment safety-valve party who will not withdraw the UK from the EU, which is the only way to prevent the demise of the UK nation-state and its indigenous people from the increasingly Islamified multicultural European Union. Islamification is a deliberate EU policy implemented through the 1995 Barcelona Process, now the Mediterranean European-Arab Cooperation {MEDEA} (a name change to confuse the people) and other EU initiatives, where, as always, the flow of mass immigration is one way. Into white majority countries only. Muslims make little or no concessions while the neo-Marxist elites make all the cultural and social concessions as the Islamification of the European nation-states is made irreversible by mass immigration/multiculturalism. The MEDEA initiative includes an enlarged European Federal Superstate of the Regions, including Turkey (71m population), North Africa and some West African states. Hopefully June 4 will see the BNP and the other Nationalists of Europe make a huge impact in the Euro elections and begin the end of the criminal neo-Marxist project, the EUSSR.</p>
