			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Science Daily, May 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A study forthcoming in the Journal of Labor Economics suggests that high-quality teachers tend to leave schools that experience inflows of black students. According to the study&rsquo;s author, C. Kirabo Jackson (Cornell University), this is the first study to show that a school&rsquo;s racial makeup may have a direct impact on the quality of its teachers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Jackson&rsquo;s findings suggest that it&rsquo;s not neighborhoods keeping high-quality teachers away; it&rsquo;s the students  &mdash;  and it&rsquo;s directly related to their race.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is particularly sobering because it implies that, all else equal, black students will systematically receive lower quality instruction,&#8221; Jackson said. &#8220;This relationship may be a substantial contributor to the black-white achievement gap in American schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This study implies teachers may prefer a student body that is more white and less black,&#8221; Jackson says.</p>
<p>Black teachers were slightly more likely than white teachers to stay in the schools that experienced a black inflow, the study found. However, those black teachers who did leave black schools tended to be the highest qualified black teachers. So the decline in quality was somewhat more pronounced among black teachers than white teachers.</p>
<p>Just what it is about black students that pushes high-quality teachers away is hard to pin down, Dr. Jackson says. It could be that teachers are reacting to notions about black students&rsquo; achievement or income levels.<br>

<p>I wonder how Jackson explains the substantial contributing factors that results in the &#8220;Black&#8221;-Asian, &#8220;Black&#8221;-Brown, and the multitudinous &#8220;Black&#8221;-&#8220;other&#8221; achievement gap in American schools?</p>

Blacks often complain about the lack of black teachers to teach their black children. There&rsquo;s the standard black conspiratorial explanations for this; racism, actively preventing blacks from becoming teachers, using only white teachers so as to promote a white supremacy agenda, prevent black kids from having strong black role models, make black kids think only white people are smart enough to teach, etc. However, the reason there are few black teachers is far more simple.</p>
<p>I was listening to our local black radio talk show host who was interviewing a black woman who recently graduated with a teaching degree. The host asked why there were so few black teachers. She gave a blunt and straightforward reason which the host quickly ignored.</p>
<p>According to this black woman, blacks don&rsquo;t go into the teaching field because they know how black kids behave in the classroom and they want nothing to do with teaching black students.</p>
<p>For years, my sister taught at a Catholic school. She left to teach at a public school because she could more than double her pay and receive a choice retirement plan.</p>
<p>At first, she joked about what it was liking teaching black kids. She doesn&rsquo;t joke about it any more. Now, her and another teacher are counting off their days to retirement.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been around black kids knows they don&rsquo;t want to be.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It could be that teachers are reacting to notions about black students&rsquo; achievement or income levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Income levels mean nothing.  It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s behind the low achievement that is driving teachers away:  backtalk, the threat of physical violence, not taking school subjects seriously, being disruptive and loud, bringing the &#8220;rap culture&#8221; with them, etc.</p>
<p>And those are more than just &#8220;notions&#8221;.  They&rsquo;re reality, which is why teachers are letting their feet do the talking.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Police arrested three more students Thursday afternoon in connection with the Monday beating and stoning of a teacher at Portola Middle School in El Cerrito.</p>
<p>In total, police have arrested five teens   &mdash;   two 13-year-old girls, a 14-year-old girl and two 14-year-old boys, whose names are not being released   &mdash;   on suspicion of assaulting band teacher Tiffany Carrico on campus, El Cerrito police Sgt. Shawn Maples said.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the arrested students were black.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what it is about black students that pushes high-quality teachers away is hard to pin down, Dr. Jackson says. It could be that teachers are reacting to notions about black students&rsquo; achievement or income levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or it could be that teachers feel justifiably threatened when black students call them &#8220;stupid white bitches&#8221; and threaten to rape them.</p>

I have read here that many of the young &#8220;Teach For America&#8221; volunteers will quit after a few months of teaching at a school with a large minority population.</p>
<p>That should be pretty easy to gather statistics on, if it&rsquo;s true. But of course no one will report it.</p>

			<p>This is yet another of those utterly baffling sociological phenomena that seem to defy explanation.</p>
<p>The notion that highly qualified teachers would avoid environments in which they could be physically assaulted, stabbed, raped in the parking lot, or have to function as professional referees is puzzling, to say the least.</p>
<p>It would seem that vestiges of baseless racism persist even in those subjected to the highest ideals of liberal education.</p>
<p>A presidential task force to explore the root causes of this mindless prejudice is clearly indicated.</p>

			<p> Another one of those &#8220;We&rsquo;re trying to determine why everything turns to garbage when blacks move in, but we haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet&#8221; studies. What a joke! If they don&rsquo;t know, they&rsquo;ve been living in a cave for the last 50 years.</p>
<p> Perhaps these higher-quality teachers know that their time and efforts are more likely to be wasted trying to educate blacks. Perhaps they feel at that stage of their career it&rsquo;s not worth the risk of being beaten up in their classroom by one of the &#8220;home boys.&#8221; Perhaps they feel that finishing up their last few years teaching Whites (or Asians) will involve much less stress and strain.</p>
<p> But when all is said and done, the &#8220;studies&#8221; will reveal that, surprise, surprise, the teachers leave because of &#8220;White racism!&#8221;</p>

			<p> My initial impulse was to congratulate the study&rsquo;s author C. Kirabo Jackson (what sort of name is that, I wonder?) for, if nothing else, a keen grasp of the obvious. </p>
<p>But on reflection, I don&rsquo;t think s/he (?) deserves even that. We needed a <i>study</i> to explain this? Hilarious. I especially loved this gem: </p>
<p>&#8220;It could be that teachers are reacting to <i>notions</i>[emphasis added] about black students&rsquo; achievement or income levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>The use of language here is very interesting. I looked up the definition of &#8220;notion&#8221;, and number one was this: &#8220;a conception of or belief about something&#8221;. I think the inference here is clear  &mdash;  a &#8220;notion&#8221; is something not connected with direct observation or experience. If I observe that the sky is blue and the sun rises in the east, no one calls that a &#8220;notion&#8221;, because those are easily observable facts.</p>
<p>But any recognizable, predictable, unpleasant attributes of an easily distinguishable group of people can only be recognized as a &#8220;notion&#8221;  &mdash;  no direct connection with daily observation and experience permitted. No Occam&rsquo;s Razor. No, it must be that ubiquitous 24-7 anti-&#8220;minority&#8221; stereotype industry staffed by millions of white devils with nothing better to do all day, or night&hellip; (Did I mention that I just finished my shift? Long day!)</p>
<p>An interesting omission was any mention of &#8220;notions&#8221; about <i>behavior</i> of the &#8220;students&#8221; in question. I&rsquo;d bet all the teachers involved have some very definite &#8220;notions&#8221; on that subject. No connection to daily-observed reality, of course&hellip;</p>

			<p>No.  It&rsquo;s not &#8220;that teachers are reacting to notions about black students&rsquo; achievement or income levels.&#8221;  Aside from academics, where black students do no classwork or homework and don&rsquo;t pay attention, they are downright disrespectful.  The curse and insult the teacher, walk around the room and talk back when told to sit down or be quiet and then continue to ignore you.  They play and talk on their cellphones and refuse to turn them over to you when told even though such actions violate school policy.  They run the halls and graffitti the walls.  Food fights in the cafeteria.  (The very food they get for free, mind you.)  Academically they are about 4 grades below their current grade.  Not because of the teachers.  One cannot learn by acting such as described above.  And more and more money is thrown away on them to improve their academic performance. <br>

			<p>[&ldquo;Just what it is about black students that pushes high-quality teachers away is hard to pin down.&#8221;]</p>
<p>As a teacher whose had extensive education in the public school setting of Los Angeles, let me tell you:</p>
<p>1.) Black students are rude<br>
2.) They&rsquo;re pushy<br>
3.) They talk back to the teacher constantly<br>
4.) They continuously make jokes<br>
5.) They&rsquo;re always late for class<br>
6.) They verbally harass other students and each other<br>
7.) They don&rsquo;t want to learn<br>
8.) They refuse to do any classwork (don&rsquo;t even think about homework!) <br>
9.) They dress like thugs and sluts<br>
10.) Contrary to the lies that Hollywood and the movie industry puts out, blacks aren&rsquo;t waiting for good teachers to come along and save them. First of all, they resent that you&rsquo;re a teacher, they hate you for not being black, they hate that you learned something in school and they choose not to.</p>
<p>As soon as I got an offer to go to a predominantly-White and Hispanic suburban district, I was out of there like a bat out of hell. </p>

			<p>It has nothing to do with skin color but everything to do with BEHAVIOR. We have several friends who are retired teachers and they will all tell you that many black students are abusive,indolent,and totally unprepared for their grade level. Additionally they are very undisciplined, are absent very frequently, and some actually threaten teachers with violence and crude gestures. For example one of our friends said a male student grabbed his crotch with one hand and pointed at her with the other while hooting &#8220;You, you, you&#8221;. At other times some students would mock her and call her crude names when her back was turned.</p>

<p>Golly, it&rsquo;s always the elites who are last to know.  How about the possibility that teachers don&rsquo;t want to be insulted or threatened with assault, and want to work in classrooms where students can actually learn?</p>

			<p><i>Just what it is about black students that pushes high-quality teachers away is hard to pin down</i><p>It&rsquo;s no mystery at all, as anyone who has attended a school with more than a handful of African students can testify.  These students are not simply lacking in academically qualifying intelligence: they are devoid of intellectual curiosity, unambitious, incapable of planning, incapable of responsibility.  Add to that that they are incorrigibly disruptive and intractable discipline problems, and you&rsquo;ll realize that no sane person would want a teaching career if it meant teaching black students primarily.</p></p>

			<p>&#8220;It could be that teachers are reacting to notions about black students&rsquo; achievement or income levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>So earlier in the article they say that teachers do not seem to discriminate by neighborhood, suggesting that a white teacher would take a job in the poorest white neighborhood and then at the end of the article they say white teachers may not want to teach in black schools because of their low income levels?   What a ridiculous article, I can&rsquo;t believe they would publish something like this with a straight face.    The simple answer to this mystery is that black kids &#8220;act a&rsquo; fool&#8221; waaaay more than the white kids do.    Who would want to get paid $30,000 a year to put up with that?</p>

However, those black teachers who did leave black schools tended to be the highest qualified black teachers. So the decline in quality was somewhat more pronounced among black teachers than white teachers.</p>
<p>So.  The more qualified the Black, the more likely he or she would be to abandon his race to further his/her career?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a problem here.  It&rsquo;s called human nature, and I am glad that a few smart Blacks are realizing the long-term benefit of looking out for yourself, not your race.</p>

			<p>So according to the above article even the black teachers don&rsquo;t want to teach black students and would rather teach white kids.  It&rsquo;s not hard to figure out why.  Who would want to teach a class of blacks and be called names, verbally threatened or assaulted on a daily basis.  You would also be dealing with people who are overly disruptive, volatile, emotional, childish, not to mention less intelligent and more lazy.</p>

			<p>I know several teachers, including my sister, who taught in black schools.  I heard horror story after horror story from them and they left these shools as soon as they could.  The disturbing thing was that the parent or guardian of these black students were as bad as the kids themselves.  </p>

<p>Just pin the VIOLENCE, WEAPONS, ASSAULTS, RAPES, ROBBERIES, CAR VANDALISM, THEFT OF TEACHER PROPERTY and general disruptive behavior of blacks flags on this DONKEY, perhaps he can pin the problem down then. By this article&rsquo;s own admission, EVEN BLACK teachers know to leave.</p>

			<p>My high school that I dropped out of 6 months ago is 50/50 school as far as blacks and whites go.  And the teachers were lower qualified teachers, one didn&rsquo;t even speak English well enough for students to understand.  The black kids constantly harassed teachers and other students, making it impossible to learn anything and the teachers just put up with it.</p>
<p>I went to my principal many times because of conflicts in the classroom and they never did anything to solve the problem.  The teachers the black kids did get along with where young white men teachers and any black teacher.  They talked to them the whole class and we never learned anything once again.</p>
<p>I went from a straight A honor student in 8th grade to a failing student in 9th grade to a high school drop out in 11th grade because of so much conflict and non learning going on in the school.</p>
<p>When are we going to fix our schools and just separate the races.  That way we&rsquo;re all happy and learning what we need/want to.</p>

			<p>Most school districts have combat pay, extra pay for teachers who teach in majority black schools.  It goes by different names, all carefully not mentioning race, but it is the only way to keep a staff.</p>
<p>I taught for the worst year of my life in an 90 percent black ten percent hispanic school.  One 4th grade class had 6 teachers in 1 year.  One teacher only lasted a week.<br>

			<p>I had a white-hispanic friend who taught in an urban school.  One day a group of black kids were beating up a scranny Puerto Rican boy.  My Friend, a big guy, pulled the black kids off the PR kid and told the PR kid to get out.  None of the other teachers would do anything.  He didn&rsquo;t report the black kids to the Principal.  Next morning he was let go for putting a hand on the blacks.  His fellow teachers were of the opinion that he should have let the PR kid get beaten until the cops arrived or the blacks were done.</p>

			<p>Actually, in the 1950&rsquo;s, before Liberals took over my school system, there was no problem recruiting teachers, especially Black teachers to teach Black students. The reason was that disruptive students were isolated until they were 16, and then expelled. </p>
<p>The schools expelled all trouble makers without regard to race. Blacks, who are excellent compainers, never objected; they were not unhappy to be rid of them. Thankfully, there were no social psuedo-scientists &#8220;proving&#8221; that the disproportionate number of Blacks expelled was evidence of Racism. </p>

			<p>Mysterious, isn&rsquo;t it?  For the life of me I can&rsquo;t fathom why teachers would avoid black students.  Perhaps, after they solve this mystery, they can tackle the larger puzzle of just what might have caused some Jews to flee Nazi Germany.</p>

			<p>At the end of a school day, I want to feel good because I accomplished something, not relieved because I&rsquo;m off the hook until the next morning.  Why anyone would choose to put up with abusive children is beyond me.  It&rsquo;s probably a neurological deformity.  I&rsquo;d rather drive a dump truck.  </p>

			<p>Blacks and whites are equal, right.</p>
<p>Blacks say that they need to have white teachers.  They need to have the best white teachers.</p>
<p>But blacks and whites are equal.  So why do they need white teachers?<br>

			<p>&#8220;Just what it is about black students that pushes high-quality teachers away is hard to pin down, Dr. Jackson says.&#8221;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s incredible is he was able to say that with a straight face.  Here in Zoo York City, it&rsquo;s no accident the schools that have metal detectors at the front doors are the ones with the darkest student bodies.  You simply don&rsquo;t see them in predominantly White schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black teachers were slightly more likely than white teachers to stay in the schools that experienced a black inflow, the study found. However, those black teachers who did leave black schools tended to be the highest qualified black teachers. So the decline in quality was somewhat more pronounced among black teachers than white teachers.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Another in an infinitely long list of proofs that what I&rsquo;ve always said about blacks holds true: nobody likes them.  They don&rsquo;t even like each other.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It could be that teachers are reacting to notions about black students&rsquo; achievement&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;notions&#8221;? are you kidding? who knows better than a teacher? the teacher is at the very front lines, they see whats happening everyday, if teachers make a judgment about student performance, you can be sure that it&rsquo;s not based on  &#8220;notions&#8221;!</p>

<p>This study report belongs in the comic books section, not a scientific journal. </p>

			<p>One should congratulate these teachers for wanting to go to schools where the Student Body actually wants to learn!</p>
<p>At my high school (in the Pacific North West) in the &rsquo;90s we had exactly ONE black student who managed to single handedly always disrupt Philosophy class (sleep, talk, etc.,).  </p>
<p>Goodness I feel so sorry for todays White kids surrounded by blacks and mestizos in todays schools!  </p>

			<p>Could it be that White teachers are harassed, abused, beaten, raped and sued? Could it be that the White teacher is never accepted? Could it be that the students hate White teachers? Could it be that they don&rsquo;t want a White teacher? Could it be that the students don&rsquo;t want to learn because they are guaranteed to get &#8220;affirmative action?&#8221; Could it be that the White teacher soon realizes that she should get the hell out of there because she is not appreciated and will be harassed, abused, beaten, raped and sued?</p>

			<p>The only person who could possibly wonder why high quality teachers don&rsquo;t like to stay in schools with large numbers of Black students, is someone who has not spent any time trying to TEACH Black students.  </p>
<p>The good teachers leave because their talents and capabilities allow them to do so, and find employment in schools with more attentive, less dangerous, and less disruptive students.  They prefer to be teachers instead of wardens.</p>
<p>The less capable teachers stay because they have no options and are trapped.  Forced to endure an endless circus of disruption, chaos, and violence, they become apathetic and just go through the motions, their only goal retirement or the sweet release of death.</p>
<p>Not much of a mystery at all, IMHO.</p>

			<p>Hard to pin down? Well, let&rsquo;s see&hellip;</p>
<p>Last night, an acquaintance I&rsquo;d noticed absent from the gym finally returned.  He was on crutches with a broken leg, and one of his front teeth was missing.  He said this happened while he was &#8220;chasing a student&#8221;.  He works in one of our city&rsquo;s almost entirely black public schools.  He&rsquo;s been desperate to move up to college-level teaching, getting college certified, working on a second master&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I saw a special report on New Orleans TV, detailing physical violence against teachers by students.  One (black) woman described how a student had deliberately trapped her hand in a door and continued slamming the door on the teacher&rsquo;s hand, until the bones were crushed.  The teacher could not report the incident, because the student would then allege abuse, and the teacher would automatically be arrested and jailed.  Apparently, the students knew this, and saw this as open season on teachers.  This sort of thing was a sport for them.</p>
<p>I know a (white) teacher who was being threatened by a student (fresh out of Juvie for murder).  The student even drew cartoons of himself beheading, raping, etc., etc. the teacher&hellip;one with her severed head screaming &#8220;Help me!  Help me!&#8221;  She showed the note to the (entirely black) school administrators, who laughed it off, but confiscated the cartoons (maybe so she wouldn&rsquo;t have proof).  So, she took photocopies to the (almost entirely black&hellip;she taught in an inner-city school) police.  They laughed it off, too.</p>
<p>I could continue with this teacher&rsquo;s horror stories, but you get the drift.  Good teachers leave schools full of blacks, not because of subtle little things like students who cannot learn or who are rude and disruptive.  Those teachers leave because they fear being maimed or killed.  They leave because they are losing their minds.  I&rsquo;m sure the bad teachers want to leave, too.</p>

			<p>You can have a school that is 90% white and 10% Black, and the Blacks will cause 90% of your discipline problems. I know because I&rsquo;ve been there. I finally retired after 33 years of service, because I couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore. As soon as my house and car were paid off, I left like a bat out of hell.</p>
<p>P.S. My principal would routinely change the grades of the Blacks, so they could pass/graduate, and therefore make the school&rsquo;s graduation rate look good. I(and other teachers)saw kids handed a diploma who we knew we failed. </p>

			<p>It boggles the mind why teachers would rather work in a clean, drug free, gun free, violence free environment than in a school where the bath rooms are off limits to anyone not buying or selling dope.<br>
     A teacher in a school more than 33% black has a 100% chance of being battered by a student or parent every two years. Principals in most black schools have offices with security monitors and metal detectors.They are escorted to their cars by security guards.<br>
     On day 1 in Kindergarten, balck kids are at least a full year behind white kids and by year`s end it will be 18 months. By age 12 black kids read at a third grade level. After being held back they hit middle school at 15 are 6 feet tall and weigh 175 pounds and that is half the black girls.<br>
     I am surprised any white or black or Asian teacher even shows up at all.<br>

			<p>I sympathize with you Anonymous. I went to a 50% black school in 9th grade and spent most of my time trying to dodge harassment. I too was an honor student in 8th grade and barely managed to pass 9th but was able to go to a slightly more racially mixed school for 10th onward but I never got ahead and graduated about in the middle of my class. </p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s an easy way to solve the baffling mystery of why qualified teachers would want to leave da hood.</p>
<p>Put cameras in the classrooms, and in the hallways, and in the lunchrooms.  Just record their behavior.  Mystery solved, and without wasting millions of taxpayer dollars to try to figure out the cause (which will be Whitey&rsquo;s fault somehow).</p>
<p>The last thing they want is their behavior to be recorded.   They want no part of truly solving this &#8220;mystery&#8221;.  They just want to blame their failure on Whitey, first, last, and always.   </p>

			<p>Fot hose interested in further researching this mystery, there was an article in the New York Times Magazine in June 1993 about a suburban Chicago school dealing with an influx of black students. It was titled &#8220;We&rsquo;re All Racists Now,&#8221; a quote from a white student. One teacher was noted to have retired to a place where he would never have to see a black face again. There was also a Frontline documentary on Berkeley High called &#8220;School Colors,&#8221; and an HBO documentary on Frederick Douglass High in Baltimore recently, that may hold some clues to solving this question.</p>

			<p>I know a young man who taught high school English for three years.  Besides being crushed under the volume of weekly essays for four classes of students, many of whom wrote at elementary school level, he had to deal with constant classroom disruptions, racial insults and physical threats.  As a new teacher he decided he would write up every one of the misbehaving students. The amount of time in hearings added to his heavy grading load.  He was falling asleep at his desk at home 8 at night and not spending time with his wife and children.  Eventually he was writing up only the worst offenders.  After three years he realized that he couldn&rsquo;t not care, which is the only way many public school teachers put in their 30 years.   </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s now in financial services.</p>

			<p>If your kid is stuck in a bad school, let them drop out.  Send them to the local junior college.  If your kid looks like they might be 15, that&rsquo;s good enough; nobody asks for any ID, you pay and you&rsquo;re in.  They can start right at Algebra 1, and go from there.  There will be almost no Blacks and few Hispanics in any serious class, and those that are will either toe the line or drop out.  Any White who does not exhaust all possibilities to spare their children from diversity is abusive.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;Just what it is about black students that pushes high-quality teachers away is hard to pin down, Dr. Jackson says&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Gee, what teacher wouldn&rsquo;t want to teach aggressive, violent, impulsive, hyper-sexualized, low IQd blacks?  Even idiots from Teach For America find out within a day or two that  their dream of rescuing poor black children from White oppression is nothing but garbage they&rsquo;ve been force fed by the likes of the NY Times and the expensive colleges they attended.</p>
<p>Dr. Jackson and other &#8216;educational researchers&rsquo; well know the reasons teachers flee for their lives from black-majority schools.  But to say this or present the facts openly  will put an end to their research, grants, speaking engagements, book deals, and reputation.  </p>
<p>Never-mind that the research shows the exact opposite of the accepted doctrine.<br>
Who wants to end up like Galileo?  Better to keep one&rsquo;s mouth shut, get on the gravy train, stick to the current PC dogma and ride it out until retirement when you can collect your fat pension.  </p>
<p>Any &#8216;researcher&rsquo; who varies from PC dogma will join Charles Murray and others of his ilk who are roundly denounced as fools and charlatans by the PC overseers in the dept. of education and ed schools every where.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a &#8216;hilarious&rsquo; bit from Sol Stern writing in City Journal about Teach for America:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;many recounted one horror story after another from their rocky first year: chaotic classrooms, indifferent administrators, veteran teachers who rarely offered a helping hand. You might expect the required readings for these struggling rookies to contain good practical tips on classroom management&hellip;. Instead, the one book that the fellows had to read in full was Pedagogy of the Oppressed, by the Brazilian educator Paulo Freire. </p>
<p>This ed-school bestseller is a utopian political tract calling for the overthrow of capitalist hegemony and the creation of classless societies&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/c9oawk" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/c9oawk</a></p>
<p>As I written here before:  Education in the US has nothing to do with educating children  &mdash;  its primary purpose is to provide jobs for for blacks and other NAMs with college degrees, especially advanced degrees (remember the most PhDs earned by blacks are in the field of education).</p>
<p>Another, lesser purpose of the educational-industrial complex is to indoctrinate children into the Boas-Frankfurter school of leftist ideology, with Whites on the bottom of the NWO and every vestige of Western Civilization eradicated.  All of the textbooks adhere to this doctrine.</p>
<p>There is nothing to figure out at this point about how to educate blacks, how to educate those with average group IQs of 85 past a rudimentary level of reading and computing because it simply cannot be done.  And the researchers know it.</p>

			<p>I went to high school in the early 80&rsquo;s in Texas. Our school was mostly White then but had about 20% Black. Guess who caused 90% of the problems? The Blacks. I was in a class once that had all Blacks. They backtalked and harrassed the teacher constantly, were loud, rude and disruptive and tried to sexually harass and threaten me. They screamed racism if anyone attempted to discipline them. I couldn&rsquo;t wait until the end of the semester. It was a real nightmare, I didn&rsquo;t learn anything. Just a few years after I graduated, the school had become increasingly Black. Whites fled. I heard that girls couldn&rsquo;t even go to the bathroom because they were afraid of being attacked. This was the late 80&rsquo;s or early 90&rsquo;s. I would never send my child to a school with more than a tiny amount of middle class Blacks. It&rsquo;s child abuse.</p>

			<p>Believe me it isn&rsquo;t just the teachers. Anyone who is connected with schools in anyway has it worse when blacks are around. I was a school caretaker for several years. I worked as a replacement worker when other guys were off sick. Any largely black school was disgustingly filthy and had litter everywhere. There was far more vandalism, pilferage and theft. There was no pride or dignity. You were always made to feel like you were in a hostile environment. I always knew whether or not I would have a good or bad time of it within the first few minutes of arriving at the school by seeing how many or how few blacks there were. The more blacks, the worse EVERYTHING was at the school. But the thing was it was the behaviour of the blacks that made it that way. Had those same schools been inhabited by Whites, Japanese, etc, there would have been no real problems.</p>
