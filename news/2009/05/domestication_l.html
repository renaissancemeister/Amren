<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30628354/">Domestication Led to Horse Color Explosion</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Viegas, MSNBC, May 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The earliest domesticators of horses preferred their steeds colorful instead of color dull, according to a new study that determined breeding by humans caused horses to produce a veritable paint book of coat color shades and patterns.</p>
<p>Since the color explosion began around 5,500 years ago, researchers believe that&rsquo;s when domestication of horses really took off. But why would the ancients have been so obsessed with color?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe at the beginning, ancient farmers selected for tameness, but they realized very soon that colored horses had a greater value,&#8221; [Arne Ludwig, a scientist at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin.] explained to Discovery News, adding that old paintings often show kings and other VIP&rsquo;s riding gray, white and other colorful horses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For a study recently published in the journal Science, he and his team studied DNA differences among horse fossils from Siberia, East and Central Europe, and the Iberian Peninsula. They focused on genes responsible for horse coat color variation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Horses of late glacial times were bay (brown),&#8221; he said, and even this shade was &#8220;more dirty looking, a little bit like a mixture of gray and bay, like Przewalski horses today.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Przewalski&rsquo;s horse is a rare and endangered species of wild horse native to central Asia. &#8220;Wild&#8221; horses today, however, are actually feral horses descended from domesticated animals that at some point escaped and adapted to life in the wild.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the fifth millennium B.C., other horse colors emerged, according to the DNA findings. The first modification resulted in chestnut, a reddish shade. Silver, white, dark black, spotted, color-trimmed and numerous more patterns and colorations soon followed.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s likely prestigious individuals wanted to show off the most attractive mode of transportation, breeders might have been attracted to colorful horses since color can be tied to certain temperament and behavioral attributes.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, chestnut horses are described as not so full of spirits, which may be a big advantage for their taming,&#8221; Ludwig explained. &#8220;Dilutions and spotting patterns are linked to gene defects, or a less effective mode of operation of receptors, which possibly causes more tame behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study&rsquo;s pinpointed date for the first major domestication of horses supports yet another research team&rsquo;s findings. Alan Outram of the University of Exeter and colleagues recently studied ancient horse bones, and came to three conclusions.</p>
<p>The first was that horse domestication dates back to the Botai Culture of Kazakhstan circa 5,500 years ago. The second is that &#8220;bit damage,&#8221; caused by harnessing or bridling, reveals these early, domesticated animals were ridden. Finally, traces of horse milk fat on ancient pottery shows the Kazakhstan horse riders were consuming an alcoholic drink called &#8220;koumiss&#8221; made out of horse milk.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>I remember when a Disney movie paired up a horse, with a native American Indian, his perfect and natural match, and the only soul wise enough to understand him. Their bond making up a good part of the movie. The &#8216;irony&rsquo; being there were no horses in the New World until Europeans brought them here. </p>

			<p>The point of note here seems to be the too great of admixure created variations in color that came to denote genetic problems.  As a former horse owner, trainer and competitor (show jumping, hunter), I recall that horses with pink hoofs were known to more often have chronic hoof problems.  These horses were usually paints and Apolosa types, horses popular among Western riders and often used by Amerinds.  Those horses were taken from the wild after melding together with other escaped or captured horses.  This means they out of the control of the careful breeding that had produced strong and reliable horses for many centuries in Europe.  Interesting about how this works so well as a metaphor for what humans have been doing to their various racial (breed) types lately.  Another interesting point is that most human genetic trisomies come from areas like the Mediterranian where people have mixed most racially.</p>

			<p>Since there were no horses in the Americas before the Spanish brought them here, I wonder why the pre-Columbus Indians did not domestic the wapiti(elk), the moose, or even the bison itself as a riding and draft animal?</p>
<p>In South America, the Indians were able to domesticate the llama as a beast of burden, but a llama is not strong enough to carry a person.</p>
<p>The first horses to be domesticated were just as wild as these animals I mention above, yet in Asia man was able to domesticate them.</p>
<p>In India, man was able to domesticate an animal as wild as the elephant.  Is is foolish to try to keep as wolf as a pet, but dog breeds as gentle as the Golden Retriever, are all descended from wolves.  A dog is really a wolf that has, for thousands of years, been domesticated to accept its human owners as the alpha.</p>

Even more irony than that!  There WERE horses here &hellip; until the Indians arrived and ate them all.</p>

<p>If there was some type of correlation between humans and horse, this would imply that Blacks and Hispanics would be easier to educate and cause less crime. </p>

<p>The paleo-Indians, of thousands of years before Europeans arrived, who killed off the original American horses, mammoth, wooley rhinocerous, giant sloth, and other wildlife into extinction, can certainly debunk the liberal myth that the Indians were conservationists before the arrival of the man.</p>
<p>The early Indians, who killed off the original American horse into extinction, had no idea that they were sentencing their descendents to thousands of years of the drudgery of having to walk everywhere they went and having to carry all of their belongings on their backs.</p>
<p>It was the Spanish who brought back horses to the Americas and who were indirectly responsible for creating the famous plains horse-and-buffalo Indian culture by the year 1750.</p>
<p>Yes, we did, and still today, do our own extinctions of wildlife through habitat destruction, poaching, pollution, etc.  But at least we of the white race, beginning in the early 20th Century came to realize the error of our ways, starting with the early conservationsts like Teddy Roosevelt and John Muir.  Even today, most people in today&rsquo;s environmental and wildlife conservation movements are white.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed some temperament differences in cats according to the colors of their coats.  <br>
For instance orange or orange and white tabbies are mild tempered and timid, and have a proclivity to gaining weight and overeating.  They often have messier bowels and don&rsquo;t clean themselves as effectively as other cats.<br>
Siamese types are known for &#8220;talkativeness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereas unlike with humans of these colors:  Black cats tend to be sweet tempered and gentle; whereas all white cats tend to be irritable and snippy.</p>

			<p>I have often wondered why someone in Africa did not domesticate zebras.</p>
<p>Is this a fair question? I desire to ask in an unprejudicial way.</p>
<p>Perhaps zebras are not smart enough to be domesticated? But if Europeans can breed wolves into daschhunds &hellip;</p>

			<p>Actually, there were horses in North America before the Spanish brought them here, along with camels and rhinos and elephants.  Peleo-Amerinds hunted them all to extinction.</p>

<p>Interesting.  With humans, it&rsquo;s long been noted, though also scorned as just a folkloric notion, that redheads tend to be tempermental and hot-headed.  But the same is said also of Latins.  This may or may not be true, I don&rsquo;t really know. But we&rsquo;re constantly scolded that we shouldn&rsquo;t stereotype people; yet no stereotype would exist if there weren&rsquo;t some basic truth in it. </p>

There was an article in one of the magazines (Smithsonian or Natural History) in the 70s, before the current  PC leftist take-over of the environmental movement, in which it was estimated that the effects of the Central American Indians upon their environment were actually quite disastrous,  and were in fact limited only by their limited technological  ability to be more destructive.  Even so, they had a terrific impact on the environment.  Far from being the peaceful nature people living in harmony with Mother Nature that is the currently fashionable depiction, if they had bulldozers, dynamite, etc. they would have been much worse even than they were. </p>

			<p>Dogs are domesticated by having less fear of man. The ones that had the least fear got fed at the gabage dump. According to a reacent TV show, this happened in less than 100 years.(40-50 dog generations) The wolves with more fear were not domesticated. </p>

Europeans (well, Caucasians in general) have bred MANY kinds of domesticated animals from what were originally wild strains.  Among the Amerindians, the Incas (uniquely) did have the Llama, although I don&rsquo;t know if it was changed from the original; and I can think of NO such examples of animal breeding or domestication in North America.  </p>
<p>However, I can&rsquo;t think of a single example among sub-saharan Africans  (i.e.blacks).   Yes, some African tribes do have cows and goats, but those came from Egypt and perhaps even India. Same is true with most, or all, of their staple plant foods, virtually all of which were introduced by whites.<br>
