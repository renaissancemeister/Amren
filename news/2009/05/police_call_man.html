<h1>Police Call Man LA&rsquo;s &#8216;Largest Ever&rsquo; Serial Killer</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Watkins, AP, April 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police believe a 72-year-old insurance claims adjuster arrested earlier this month is the most prolific serial killer in the city&rsquo;s history, having raped and strangled as many as 30 older women over two decades.</p>
<p>The break in the cold case came in October when John Floyd Thomas Jr., who had twice been convicted of sexual assault, had a DNA sample taken as part of an effort to build an offender database.</p>
<p>Thomas was charged April 2 with murdering 68-year-old Ethel Sokoloff in 1972 and 67-year-old Elizabeth McKeown in 1976, both of whom were sexually assaulted and strangled. DNA matching Thomas&rsquo; was found at three other crime scenes in the 1970s and &rsquo;80s, police robbery-homicide Capt. Denis Cremins said.</p>
<p>Detectives now consider Thomas a suspect in at least 25 other killings, and the number could grow as detectives probe unsolved cases going back to the 1950s, Cremins said. It could not immediately be determined where the other killings took place.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he turns out to be the guy, he probably would be the largest ever (serial killer) in the city of Los Angeles,&#8221; Cremins said.</p>
<p>Deputy Chief Charlie Beck said police &#8220;believe that Thomas is likely connected to many more sexually motivated murders.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If convicted, Thomas faces life in prison without parole because the killings occurred before the 1977 reinstatement of the death penalty. Prosecutors may seek capital punishment if Thomas is charged in later cases.</p>
<p>Thomas was sentenced to six years in 1957 for burglary and attempted rape in Los Angeles. Two parole violations sent him back behind bars until 1966.</p>
<p>The victims in all 30 cases under review were older white women, mostly of lower incomes and often widows living alone, Cremins said. All had been sexually assaulted and most were strangled.</p>
<p>In the first wave of killings in Los Angeles in the mid-1970s, a man police dubbed &#8220;The Westside Rapist&#8221; entered the homes of dozens of elderly women who lived alone, raped them and choked them until they passed out or died. The 17 people killed were found with pillows or blankets over their faces.</p>
<p>During that time, Thomas was a social worker, hospital employee and salesman. The attacks stopped in 1978  &mdash;  the year Thomas went back to prison for the rape of a Pasadena woman.</p>
<p>After his 1983 release, he moved to Chino in San Bernardino County and took a job as a hospital peer counselor in nearby Pomona. That year, a series of attacks on elderly women began, including five slayings in the nearby Los Angeles County town of Claremont. The attacker also used blankets or pillows over his victims&rsquo; faces.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Investigators said the attacks stopped in 1989, when Thomas began working at the State Compensation Insurance Fund in Glendale. He was arrested at his South Los Angeles apartment on March 31 and resigned shortly afterward.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hutchinson said Thomas is married and has children.</p>

			<p>I keep hearing over and over again that all serial killers are white.  Not only is that not the case, but the worst serial killers, in terms of both the number of kills, the brutality of the kills, and the length of time of the spree, are black.</p>

			<p>&#8220;All his victims were white women.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been said and agreed to many times that there are more white serial killers than black ones, but I think an investigation will prove that there are MORE white serial killers, but, like every other criminal stat, black percentages are going to be higher.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that hasn&rsquo;t been brought to light before, because everybody ASSUMES it to be true due to the high profile white cases. But I&rsquo;ve accidentally stumbled across MANY black serial killers, while searching for other crimes, and the numbers are not small.</p>
<p>Somebody needs to take a look at that.  I&rsquo;m betting that there are more black serial killers&hellip;.and serial rapists&hellip;..percentagewise than whites.</p>

			<p>It is not very unusual for black rapists, even younger ones, to target white women in their 60s, 70s and 80s. They truly are perverse predators.</p>

			<p>I didn&rsquo;t find out that all his victims were white until after I read about it here on AmeRen. Honestly, I&rsquo;m not surprised.</p>
<p>When Jeffrey Dahmer committed his atrocious, sadistic murders, people in the media were calling him racist because most of his victims were black, depite the fact that a racial motivation was absent. Jeffrey Dahmer couldn&rsquo;t afford a middle class living working at a chocolate facotry, so he lived in an apartment in a heavily black area, hence the demographics of his victims reflected the demographics of his area.</p>
<p>But when the killer is black and the victims are white, as in this case, you don&rsquo;t hear anyone in the media crying &#8220;racist!&#8221;</p>

			<p>  How can this be compared to the travisty at &#8220;Duke University&#8221;?. This Thomas Jr. just made a mistake at least 30 times, but those at Duke may have called that african exocit dancer a &#8220;whatever&#8221; almost went to prison for 20 years. Duke will live forever, this Thomas story will go unreported in the MSN.</p>

			<p>A standard joke in the repetoire of black comedians is the notion that only whites are serial murderers (even though statistically their own race is so emblematic of homicide).</p>

			<p>     With all of his previous convictions, why was this guy walking the streets? We either should lock them up for life or execute them. For those who say that it is too expensive to house them for life, go tell it to Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The only reason we build expensive prisons is so that the politicians can get their mitts on more graft money.</p>

In Buffalo, we had a serial killer/rapist by the name of Altemio Sanchez. He committed rapes and murders over a 25 year period (though probably longer).</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s hispanic. All his victims were white:</p>

<p>I and others have posted a NYT article citing studies citing blacks as 12 to 20 percent of the serial killer population (and 12 percent of the general population) here and at a popular WN forum.  You should be able to find it if your searchfu is adequate.  I can&rsquo;t recall what, if anything, the article had to say about the white percentage.</p>

			<p>There was another african serial killer a few years back.</p>
<p>He was a maintenance worker in a hospital where his sister worked as a nurse.</p>
<p>He had the rotting corpses of nine (eight were white) women in his house that he raped and killed.</p>
<p>His mother and sister &#8220;claimed&#8221; that they didn&rsquo;t notice the stench of bodies because the african kept so much rotting garbage throughout the house. </p>

			<p>Ranger&hellip;<br>
In terms of rate, blacks are about twice as likely as whites to be serial killers. This is a negative outlier, as the overall proneness to murder ratio is around 7.<br>
It seems the mindset of the real serial killer (planning ability?) is rarer in blacks.<br>
Of course, most serial killers are white, but that´s only a matter of absolute number.<br>

			<p>Let me fine tune what ranger is saying and I think he might agree with me.  People are so conditioned to the fact that blacks are, proportionally, vastly over-represented in crime. We&rsquo;re used to the fact that most murderers and rapists are black and, though they won&rsquo;t admit it, so are the liberals.  Therefore, when it looks like there is one type of crime where blacks are LESS over-represented (serial killers), the hostile elite pounces on it and twists statistics/words around so that &#8220;less over-represented&#8221; turns into &#8220;under-represented&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s all relative but, no matter how you look at it, blacks are over-represented in all crime where they have equal opportunity to commit it.</p>
<p>As for me, I am confused and angry that the most likely victims of black crime: white women, are also the most vocal advocates of black criminals.</p>

<p>Is not the Associated Press the MSM?</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s interesting that the police would limit the geographical boundary to the Los Angeles city limits just to enable Thomas to achieve the status as &#8220;most prolific serial killer in the city&rsquo;s history&#8221; for the suspected murder of 30 women. That would seem to be doing the opposite of attempting to quash the story. As a matter of fact, back in 1983, my next door neighbor in Long Beach, just south of L.A,  was a serial killer by the name of Randy Kraft. When he was apprehended, his suspected tally was closer to 70 and few have heard of him. </p>

			<p> I&rsquo;m not even sure the LA Times mentioned the story  &mdash;  it was not up on the website when I checked (I did not search, shouldn&rsquo;t a story of this magnitude be the lead story, especially here in LA?).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the headline from LAs &#8216;other&rsquo; paper (just as left-leaning, if not worse).</p>
<p>&#8220;Accused Serial Killer Described as a Doll!&#8221;</p>
<p>The very first paragraph states:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The 72-year old man was described as a &#8220;doll&#8221; who loved his children by a colleague at the Glendale office where he worked for 20 years&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I am not making this up.</p>
<p>I fully expect the msm to bury this story by the end of the day.  After all, it seems all of the victims were expendable Whites.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how the media closed down the reporting about the &#8216;D.C. Sniper&rsquo; a few years ago and nearly every time I read something about this monster the article mentioned how surprised people were and how, &#8216;Oh something must have happened because he was such a nice man&rsquo;, sort of thing.  Obviously this is the liberal media&rsquo;s way of demonizing White people, especially White males.</p>

<p>A common canard among leftist journalists is your &#8220;typical&#8221; serial killer is a White male.  They disingenuously forget to mention the fact White males still vastly outnumber black males in this country.</p>
<p>When numbers are crunched, it turns out that on a per capita basis, black males are significantly overrepresented as serial killers.  The following link leads to a study done by La Griffe du Lion clearly demonstrating this fact.  Warning: the language is &#8220;technical,&#8221; but if you can understand it, it&rsquo;s well worth reading.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/serial.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/serial.htm</a></p>
<p>Though La Griffe doesn&rsquo;t address it in his study, I strongly suspect the well-documented White-black racial difference in IQ is a big factor in why you don&rsquo;t see more black serial killers.  Since White sociopaths are, on average, more intelligent than black ones, they can probably &#8220;cover their tracks&#8221; better and for a longer period of time.</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t forget Colin Ferguson who, under the auspices of &#8220;black rage&#8221;, killed 6 and injured 19 in Long Island, NY.  His soulless low-life attorneys, William Kunstler and Ron Kuby, (before he fired them) argued that Ferguson suffered from temporary insanity/mental illness through years of living in an oppressive and racist society.</p>

			<p>Let me guess: Hollywood is already planning the movie, in which the serial killer is white and preys exclusively on non-whites.</p>
<p>You can also bet that the $PLC is already writing &#8216;intelligence reports&rsquo; on anyone who dares mention him and his victims, because only &#8216;hate&rsquo; would be behind such speech.</p>

			<p>I suspect that a lot of Black or Hispanic serial killers go unnoticed, as long as they limit themselves to their ghettos and barrios.  When a drug addict or prostitute is found dead, no one is surprised.  The police might start to pay attention if they see a series of unusual killing with common traits, but if a killer just shoots some pathetic lowlife in an alley and leaves, the assumption will be that it was a simple robbery or drug deal gone off the rails.  The cops will gather evidence and question the locals, and file a report, and the Black or Hispanic serial killer can do it again in a few months.  The static of daily violence will obscure the crimes of an individual.  </p>

			<p>I wonder how many White women have been killed by blacks since the 1960&rsquo;s &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; era?  Without a doubt the total number would qualify as a racial genocide.    </p>
<p>One day I hope to write a book on this. &#8220;Black male predators  and their White female victims since 1964&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>I live near a college campus in Chicago and am routinely sickened by the ever frequent sight of blacks with their arms around White coeds as they stroll around the neighborhood. I&rsquo;m confronted with this sort of thing practically every time I go to the local movie theater as well.</p>

			<p>Generally, legitimate serial-killers operate in a far more methodical and deliberate fashion than Black murderers, who rarely put a great deal of thought into their actions, beyond perhaps simple planning for the immediate crimes themselves. The motivations and modus operandi are usually quite different, though the end results are, of course, equally horrible.    </p>

			<p>The Mayor of Los Angeles, Mexican Nationalist at heart, Antonio Villaraigosa, stated several times, while being backed by idiotic sycophantic police Chief Bratton, that crime in Los Angeles was lower now then it was in the 1950&rsquo;s. These are the kinds of statements that reveal the inner nature of the people in charge in Los Angeles.</p>

			<p>It has been a month since his arrest for murder, I have not seen his face on Nancy Grace or any national news service. One would think that exposure of this guy would  solve unsolved Killings all over the country, let alone freeing some unfortunates who were wrongfully convicted of his crimes, an event that freed three in Texas when  Abbott was caught.<br>
     Could it be our politically correct media want to bask in Obama`s glow of a non racial society for white tax payers and not expose another black monster, aka the Atlanta child killer, and Atlanta Court house butcher? If he is lucky he will get the death penalty, which in California will assure the best medical care, a private room, three squares and a tv set. He will have been dead about 10 years before his appeals run out.<br>

			<p>&ldquo;&hellip;The 72-year old man was described as a &ldquo;doll&rdquo; who loved his children by a colleague at the Glendale office where he worked for 20 years&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Thomas was a nice man who loved his kids, his acts bespeak a high level of hidden rage directed at white women. Which means this is yet another black on white hate crime that will go unprosecuted since whites &#8220;deserve&#8221; to be killed according to the [genocidal] liberal mindset. </p>
<p>Aside from the liberal-MSM angle, go back to the basic point. Contemplate that this black man who seemed nice to the people who saw him day to day hated white women enough to kill them one by one for a period of years. Really think about what kind of focused hate it takes to achieve something like that and keep doing it for 30 years. </p>
<p>Ask yourself what other &#8220;nice black men&#8221; you encounter have feelings like this. How do they act out those feelings? </p>

			<p>The reason that prosecutors have such little sympathy for such individuals is because they have to deal with the victims&rsquo; families!  He preyed upon the most defenseless among us. Women who must have had children, relatives, friends, co-workers, lives! Could it be that their only fault was to be have been born white?</p>
<p>Was this a way of his rationalizing his own mental dysfunctionality? Only white women so it&rsquo;s O.K.? I wonder? In passing, I also can&rsquo;t help but wonder how many of these women were liberal, black supporters?</p>
<p>As was said in the movie &#8220;The Unforgiven&#8221; he took from them everything they had been,  everything they were, everything they could ever hope to be! From the standpoint of these innocent women now, whether or not this man was black or white, lives or dies, is now irrelevant.    </p>

			<p>I read the story about this serial killer/rapist yesterday on the internet and my very first thought was how am I supposed to protect myself if the article doesn&rsquo;t give a description of the criminal and I knew that this guy was a minority, black, hispanic, whatever, it didn&rsquo;t mention it anywhere in the article but I knew.  I knew deep down inside that this guy WAS NOT WHITE. They would have mentioned that tidbit in the very first sentence of the article.</p>
<p>This is preposterous.  A serial killer loose but not a mention of his color who any type of description.  Maybe some of those women could have been saved from him had they known what to keep a lookout for.  But in the age of political correctness, the lives of men, women and children mean absolutely nothing.  They are to be sacrifical lambs on the altar of diversity and pc.  </p>

			<p>Will this story be covered on the MSM?  That&rsquo;s a laugh.  No, only here and maybe on VDare.com.  It was this site that I learned about the Carr Brothers in Witcha, KS and how they raped and murdered 4 young people, the 5th having been saved because the bullet meant for her brain, bounced off a barret she had in her hair.  It was here and on VDare.com that I learned all of the facts of the Knoxville murders by 5 black thugs.  Oh and on page 7 of our local Johnson City Press mentioned the murders.  </p>
<p>It has become increasingly obvious that the MSM and politicians will do everything they can to protect the colored classes in this country by any means necessary.  This story is just another example.</p>

			<p>I noticed that a poster above mentioned the DC Snipers.  Although never mentioned in public, I&rsquo;m sure that the authorities running that case were really mad when they found out it was 2 black men.  That&rsquo;s why they put Chief Moose out in front of the cameras everyday.  Everyone had to notice how the white FBI agents, who most certainly should have been in charge of that case, were silently standing behind Chief Moose.  Now what does the Chief of Police of Montgomery County know about running a case like the sniper case - absolutely nothing.  He was the token black and even more so when they found out that (what a shame) it wasn&rsquo;t some white guys shooting people.</p>

			<p>There are far more white serial killers than there are black  ones.True. Whites are more numerous than blacks in the US by a factor of six. That is why.Are there only one sixth as many black serial killers as there are white ones?No,they comprise considerably more than one sixth of all serial killers.And they have a far greater tendency to target whites than white serial killers target blacks.It is just like the lame argument that there are more whites on welfare than thare are blacks.Actually, in the last few years, blacks on welfare outnumber whites in sheer numbers.</p>

			<p>Blinkoncrime.com has a map of his victim&rsquo;s and his home address.  Surprise, surprise.  He lived right off Saint Martin Luther King blvd.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why he was called the West side rapist.  All his rape/murders were committed east of La Cieniega.  LaCieniega is considered the dividing line between West LA and the rest of the city.</p>
<p>The article hedged on where he worked, tried to give the impression it was a private insurance company.  His employer is the State of California Workmen&rsquo;s comp agency.  Thus he has access to all sorts of information, including the home addresses of everyone who has been injured at work.</p>
<p>Everyone of his employeers has been some sort of government agency.  So for those of you who don&rsquo;t believe that government agencies routinely hire blacks with serious, serious felony records, here is the prove.</p>
<p>He was a governemt worker for 40 years despite his serious felony record.</p>

			<p>I must say thanks to &#8220;anonymous&#8221; for the long list of black serial killers. That list finally and once and for all dispels the myth that only whites are serial killers which I have heard over and over throughout the years.  <br>
   However nobody knows about a list like the above because the liberal media has an agenda and that agenda is to portray that all blacks are victims of white racism and it&rsquo;s whites that are &#8220;evil&#8221; when the real truth is just the opposite.  <br>
   A good example of this is when I asked just about all the people I know including family and friends and co-workers if they ever heard of the Christian Newsome murders or the Wichita Massacre and I got 0 response.  It&rsquo;s a real problem when the MSM feeds America and the world nothing but propaganda to fulfill a political agenda instead of doing their job and reporting the news the way it is. But of course we all know that anybody that tells the truth is a white right wing racist hate monger that is a threat to the security of America. Just do a Google and read the Janet Napolitano DHS report!</p>

			<p>In my self-defense research, I have found little to no mention of Black serial killers and I thank &#8220;anonymous&#8221; for the list. After checking my library, I have found several books listing serial killers going back to the 1700&rsquo;s without a single black serial killer in the list. Books by the famous FBI profiler,John Douglas, sheds no light either. I note the reference to the Zebra killings vastly underestimate the numbers. The Nation of Islam &#8220;Death Angels&#8221; (See Zebra by Howard) conservatively noted that the California police alone had counted a few hundred killings in California alone that were directly linked &#8220;NOI&#8221;, but never enough to convict. It is also believed that the &#8220;Smiley Face&#8221; killers, who drown college age White athletes, are believed to be black.<br>

That &#8220;Black Serial/Mass/Spree Killer List&#8221; posted by Posted by Anonymous at 7:43 PM on May 1, is remarkable. I had no idea they were so prolific. I too had been of the understanding that serial killing was a white thing, but apparently not. </p>
<p>I always figured blacks didn&rsquo;t go in for serial slaying   &mdash;   as opposed to the dumb, unplanned, impromptu, spur-of-the-moment random stabbings and shootings that are the more familiar MO of African homicide   &mdash;   because all the planning and forethought needed for such multiple murderings would be too much like WORK. </p>

			<p>La Griffe Du Lion has a post up about this.</p>
<p>There ARE more white serial killers, because whites have a higher Standard Deviation in behavior. </p>
<p>So while blacks are more criminalistic on average by a large margin, when we are talking rare horrific crimes like serial killings, which are 4+ standard deviations from the norm, the white incidence rate is greater.</p>

			<p> If the man was white and women were black every main stream media outlet would have the murders as the lead story.After the news media slowed up the talk show hosts would talk about their outrage.The dimwits on the view would have experts on the show talking about new hate crime laws the government should pass.However the story will be quickly forgotten and if some so called expert talks about it on the boob tube,he would figure out a way to blame white people for oppressing blacks,by the time the expert psychologist was done the black perpetrator would also be looked at as a victim. </p>

<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s not 100% correct.<br>
The FBI devides serial killers into two broad catagories: organized and disorganized.  The type you are thinking about are the organized variety.  These are the ones who put alot of thought and planning into their crimes and who are the sort that are most depicted on TV and the movies.  The disorganized killers are the ones who commit their crimes on whim and put little if no thought into it.  </p>
<p>Think of the difference between Ted Bundy and Jack the Ripper.  The former was organized while the latter was most certainly disorganized.</p>
<p>This guy and the illegal Hispanic &#8220;railroad killer&#8221; that someone referenced above almost certainly fall into the catagory of disorgnanized serial killers.<br>

			<p>Black men commit many more murders than white men, per capita. No question.</p>
<p>However a lot of speculation, but no hard evidence, about serial killers here. Are there black serial killers. sure. Do they kill white women in proportion to white serial killers or in greater serial proportion than white serial killers?  I don&rsquo;t know. </p>
<p>Until I know, I won&rsquo;t make the claim black men are more prone to mass murder of white women. </p>
<p>To make such claims, if unproven, open critics of black behavior up to charges of &#8220;racism&#8221; because empirical evidence is absent. Let them hurl racism at us if we do have the evidence. Then the defense of black serial killers becomes as weak as the defense of black killers who murder as part of a felony scheme or gang behavior.</p>
<p> Don&rsquo;t give them an issue they can discredit white about, and then demand lower sentences for black killers.</p>

<p>What is up with the film Obsessed, wherein a psycho white woman stalks a saintly, gainfully-employed black man and a black woman, played by Beyonce, must defend her family from this threat? </p>
<p>This is little more than hate speech, rubbing off the stalkerish, sex-crazed behavior of black men  (see O.J. Simpson, John Floyd Thomas Jr., Curtis Lavelle Vance) on white women. </p>
<p>In other words this movie turns the victims into the victimizers, justifying yet more victimization. The kind of sick propaganda one might expect from a society bent on genocide. </p>
<p>Seriously, what is going on with this? Because on the face of it a sane reaction to this would be one of extreme hostility.</p>

There was such a commotion from the liberals because the Bush campaign had dare to point out how Michael Dukakis had let this black killer out on a weekend leave where he promptly escaped then held a couple hostage while raping the wife.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;However a lot of speculation, but no hard evidence, about serial killers here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There have been few studies of the race and ethnicity of serial killers, but the handful that have been done suggest that black serial killers occur in roughly equal  &mdash;  or even slightly greater  &mdash;  proportion to the number of blacks in the population. These studies estimate that between 13 and 22 percent of American serial killers are black. &rdquo;</p>

			<p>The law enforcement definition of a serial kille is someone who has murdered more than one person, using this definition, including drug related and gang crimes, blacks would certainly have a higher number of &#8220;serial killers&#8221;.</p>

			<p>My father used to say that whites top the serial murderer list because they&rsquo;re smart enough not to get caught. I&rsquo;m not sure what to make of this to be honest, perhaps stereotyping ALL serial murderers as middle-class whites was a serious mistake but if we don&rsquo;t use stereotypes we would have no where to start when looking for possible people.</p>

			<p>&#8220;No doubt that the insurance company this murderer worked for has no liability for his actions. And the cops knew he was guilty all along&hellip;&hellip;..&#8221;</p>
<p>The insurance company is a state of california agency, the State Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation agency.</p>
<p>This man is like many other black affirmative action government employees, a felon with a record.  That&rsquo;s affirmative action, hire a black with a dishonorable discharge and a felony record for a government job while qualified Whites are banned from government work.<br>

<p>A race crime can only be considered a race crime if the VICTIM(S) IS BLACK! But this must be blamed on the cultural insanity of politically correct thinking!</p>

			<p>&#8220;As for me, I am confused and angry that the most likely victims of black crime: white women, are also the most vocal advocates of black criminals.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you know 1970&rsquo;s Los Angeles demographics, you know that the neighborhood where this predator hunted his prey is more or less the Fairfax High School neighborhood.  Demographics have changed, but during his career that neighborhood was the absolute heartland of pro black anti white liberals.  This was one of the neighborhoods that supported black Mayor Bradley and marched and supported financially every pro black anti white activity that occurred.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the individual victims wanted, but I do know that their neighborhood was very, very pro black and anti white liberal during the time he was raping and murdering.</p>

			<p>Justice Department Statistics About Black On White Race Violence<br>
&#8216;The Race War Of Black Against White&rsquo; by Paul Sheehan<br>
The Sydney Morning Herald, Australia, 20 May 1995<br>
The longest war America has ever fought is the Dirty War, and it is not over. It has lasted 30 years so far and claimed more than 25 million victims. It has cost almost as many lives as the Vietnam War. It determined the result of last year&rsquo;s congressional election.</p>
<p>Yet the American news media do not want to talk about the Dirty War, which remains between the lines and unreported. In fact, to even suggest that the war exists is to be discredited. So let&rsquo;s start suggesting, immediately.</p>
<p>No matter how crime figures are massaged by those who want to acknowledge or dispute the existence of a Dirty War, there is nothing ambiguous about what the official statistics portray: for the past 30 years a large segment of black America has waged a war of violent retribution against white America.</p>
<p>And the problem is getting worse, not better. In the past 20 years, violent crime has increased more than four times faster than the population. Young blacks (under 18) are more violent than previous generations and are 12 times more likely to be arrested for murder than young whites.</p>
<p>Nearly all the following figures, which speak for themselves, have not been reported in America: </p>
<p>• According to the latest US Department of Justice survey of crime victims, more than 6.6 million violent crimes (murder, rape, assault and robbery) are committed in the US each year, of which about 20 per cent, or 1.3 million, are inter-racial crimes. </p>
<p>• Most victims of race crime &mdash; about 90 per cent &mdash; are white, according to the survey &#8220;Highlights from 20 Years of Surveying Crime Victims&#8221;, published in 1993. </p>
<p>• Almost 1 million white Americans were murdered, robbed, assaulted or raped by black Americans in 1992, compared with about 132,000 blacks who were murdered, robbed, assaulted or raped by whites, according to the same survey. </p>
<p>• Blacks thus committed 7.5 times more violent inter-racial crimes than whites even though the black population is only one-seventh the size of the white population. When these figures are adjusted on a per capita basis, they reveal an extraordinary disparity: blacks are committing more than 50 times the number of violent racial crimes of whites. </p>
<p>• According to the latest annual report on murder by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, most inter-racial murders involve black assailants and white victims, with blacks murdering whites at 18 times the rate that whites murder blacks. </p>
<p>These breathtaking disparities began to emerge in the mid-1960&rsquo;s, when there was a sharp increase in black crime against whites, an upsurge which, not coincidentally, corresponds exactly with the beginning of the modern civil rights movement.</p>
<p>Over time, the cumulative effect has been staggering. Justice Department and FBI statistics indicate that between 1964 and 1994 more than 25 million violent inter-racial crimes were committed, overwhelmingly involving black offenders and white victims, and more than 45,000 people were killed in inter-racial murders. By comparisons 58,000 Americans died in Vietnam, and 34,000 were killed in the Korean war.</p>
<p>When non-violent crimes (burglary, larceny, car theft and personal theft) are included, the cumulative totals become prodigious. The Bureau of Justice Statistics says 27 million non-violent crimes were committed in the US in 1992, and the survey found that 31 per cent of the robberies involved black offenders and white victims (while only 2 per cent in the reverse).</p>
<p>When all the crime figures are calculated, it appears that black Americans have committed at least 170 million crimes against white Americans in the past 30 years. It is the great defining disaster of American life and American ideals since World War II.</p>
<p>All these are facts, yet by simply writing this story, by assembling the facts in this way, I would be deemed a racist by the American news media. It prefers to maintain a paternalistic double-standard in its coverage of black America, a lower standard.<br>

			<p>Look at the actual crime statistics that the Justice Department has kept for 50 plus years, though the sociological psychological cause and effect variables need constant review, it still boils down to extreme violence, whether it be murder, rape or aggravated assault. </p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re dead you are dead, or a victim of any crime, you are a victim.  When you take the murder conviction data over the last 30 years (including an extrapolation of unsolved murders-over 600,000 murders in 30 years!) blacks(13% of population) account for well over 65% of all murders and now the violent hispanic (14% of legal population) crime rates are way over their percentage of the population. </p>
<p>In 2005 there were a reported 37,000 rapes of white women by blacks (rapes are way under reported) and less than 100 black women raped by white men). Whites out number blacks by approx. 5 to 1, so you can see the disproportionate ratio quite clearly. </p>
<p>These violent crimes are happening now, and have been disproportionately high since before the 60&rsquo;s. The murder of whites by blacks in just one year is more than the lynching count of all blacks in the approx. 70 years of records kept by the Tuskagee Institute (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_in_the_United_States)   &mdash;  -</p>
<p>These are big numbers. I&rsquo;ve been around a lot of racial murder victims and they have been particularly henious. They are going to get worse, read some of the African Baseline Studies (and other similar black ethnocentric curriculum) that are being taught on the taxpayers dime, and they may give you some insight on the hate that is being taught to black youth. </p>
<p>We are balkanizing and rigid law enforcement must be implemented immediately, or there really will be an out of control situation coming. You can&rsquo;t wish or explain away the black on White crime data. <br>

<p>Here are some more shocking statistics: <br>
  <br>
  </p>
<p>More than 1,600 Whites are murdered by Blacks each year. <br>
  <br>
  </p>
<p>Blacks murder Whites at 18 times the rate Whites murder Blacks. <br>
  <br>
  </p>
<p>About 1 million Whites were murdered, robbed, assaulted, or raped by Blacks in 1992. <br>
  <br>
  </p>
<p>In the last 30 years, 170 million violent and nonviolent crimes were committed by Blacks against Whites in the U.S. <br>
  <br>
  </p>
<p>Blacks under 18 are more than 12 times more likely to be arrested for murder than Whites the same age. <br>
  <br>
  </p>
<p>Some 90% of the victims of race crimes are Whites. <br>
  <br>
  </p>
<p>Blacks commit 7.5 times more violent interracial crimes than Whites, although they comprise only one-seventh of the White population. <br>
  <br>
  </p>
<p>On a per-capita basis, blacks commit 50 times more violent crimes than Whites. <br>
  <br>
  </p>
<p>Some 27 million nonviolent crimes were committed in the U.S. in 1992 alone. 31% of the robberies involved Black offenders and White victims; only 2% involved White offenders and Black victims. <br>
  <br>
  </p>
<p>1.3 million of the 6.6 million violent crimes committed in the U.S. each year are interracial.<br>
