<h1>Black CEOs Better Off If They Have a Baby Face</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Thomas, Chicago Sun Times, May 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A new study from Northwestern University&rsquo;s Kellogg School of Management indicates that a youthful face is more likely to help black CEOs, like Aylwin Lewis of Sears and Clarence Otis, Jr., of Darden Restaurants [see below].</p>
<p>But only if the baby face is black, according to a study spearheaded by Professor Robert Livingston of Northwestern University&rsquo;s Kellogg School of Management. His findings  &mdash;  titled &#8220;The Teddy Bear Effect: Does babyfaceness benefit black CEOs?&#8221;  &mdash;  will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Psychological Science.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s any feature, trait or quality of a person that makes them appear to be less threatening and less hostile, and we believe that&rsquo;s really critical for black males,&#8221; said Livingston, who has studied such areas as social inequality and institutional discrimination for nearly a decade. &#8220;Because the default, based on stereotypes in the society, is that many people perceive black males to be hostile and threatening. And so if you have some sort of feature that signals, &#8216;Hey, you don&rsquo;t have to be afraid of me,&rsquo; or &#8216;I&rsquo;m just like you,&rsquo; then that makes people feel more comfortable with these individuals in positions of power.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study asked non-black men and women to evaluate head-shot photos of 10 black men and 30 white women and men. The 10 blacks all were current or former CEOs of Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>Participants rated each photo based on perceived babyfaceness, attractiveness, age and appearance. {snip}</p>
<p>Across the board, the black CEOs were thought to be warmer and more baby-faced. In addition, the more baby-faced black CEOs were thought to draw higher salaries. {snip}</p>
<p>Conversely, past studies have shown that babyfaceness hinders rather than helps white males who aspire to positions of power.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s life.  Don&rsquo;t think your personal appearance affects your prospects and life&rsquo;s position?  Then you&rsquo;re naive.  A UCLA research study shows that a political candidate makes his first, strongest and most important impression in the first <b>one-tenth</b> of a second that his potential constituents see him or her.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;A new study from Northwestern University&rsquo;s Kellogg School of Management indicates that a youthful face is more likely to help black CEOs, like Aylwin Lewis of Sears and Clarence Otis, Jr., of Darden Restaurants [see below].</p>

<p>What a load of the typical anti-white &ldquo;psychological&rdquo; poppycock and &ldquo;sociological&rdquo; balderdash! </p>
<p>To begin with, neither Aylwin Lewis or Clarence Otis, Jr. look particularly &ldquo;baby faced&rdquo; to me. Ladies, I am not in the habit of judging other men&rsquo;s facial features (particularly on such criteria as that,) so please feel free to correct me if I am wrong here, but both of these guys look like your typical &ldquo;African-American&rdquo; males to me, except for the fact that they have mindlessly contented expressions on their kissers, and not the usual look of overtly roiling hatred that is expected. Is that what constitutes a &ldquo;baby face&rdquo; today for black males, the look of an intellectually challenged infant that is sanguinely blissful, because he was allowed to freely evacuate his bowels on the floor with a reward instead of a rebuke as the outcome? After all, who wouldn&rsquo;t be in such a state of  satisfied rapture, if they were obtaining millions of dollars for such scatological achievements?</p>
<p>My second point is this, how were the &ldquo;baby faces&rdquo; or non-baby faces of the whites determined here? Were the participants simply asked if they felt them to be &ldquo;warmer&rdquo; and more &ldquo;youthful,&rdquo; or more playful and outgoing? What was the criteria for white &ldquo;baby faces?&rdquo; Moreover, how were the non-baby faces of whites categorized and (as is apparent by the description above) since there were no non-baby faces represented, how do we know what reaction they might obtain? Could not a non-baby faced black male or a similar white man, be seen as more commanding in a leadership position?</p>
<p>Finally, where does Comrade BO fit into all of this? As a racial hybrid of the two races, does he or should he represent a mixture of both the baby faced and non-baby faced dynamic?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>As has been pointed out many times on this site, most stereotypes are based on reality.</p>

			<p>A quick correction, to all AR website posters and readers; please read this sentence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover, how were the non-baby faces of whites categorized and (as is apparent by the description above) since there were no non-baby faces represented, how do we know what reaction they might obtain?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Black ceo&rsquo;s were given their positions strictly as an appeasement to the affirmative action policies, just as other blacks are awarded positions they&rsquo;re not qualified for.</p>
<p>I can say with considerable experience that I NEVER met a black in the business world that had an understanding of even the basic concepts involved in simple debits and credits and certainly not complicated financial statements where a large number of departments and subsideraries were involved.</p>
<p>Further, I think it&rsquo;s disgraceful to appoint these people to high level positions, and I think the shareholders have to be real deadheads to allow it.</p>
<p>I guess their reasoning is that as long as the economy was booming, and their dividend checks looked goo and their stocks rose they didnt care.</p>
<p>During this downward spiral in the economy, which will continue on into 2014, in spite of the lies being told to us, It will be interesting to see how the field is culled.</p>
<p>There are presently 20% of ALL homeowners who owe more than there homes are worse.</p>
<p>Get ready.  The other shoe is about to drop.  &#8220;Gimme&#8221; time and AA are going to go be much less prevalent in the very near future.</p>
<p>Too, this messiah may eventually be as disliked as Bush was, which would be quite a feat, since he has a slobbering following that borders on cult worship.</p>

			<p>So Black executives require attractiveness including possibly, a &#8220;baby face.&#8221; Can that be interpreted to mean education, managerial skills and experience do not have to be guiding factors in promoting Blacks to upper-level management positions? That need to be &#8220;qualified&#8221; is only for Whites?</p>

			<p>I have worked at a senior level in the telecommunications industry for over thirty years. In all my time I never ONCE met a mid or upper-level black manager or supervisor who I honestly and sincerely felt DESERVED their postion. They were in my judgement advanced only because of their race, not due to their intelligence or abilitiy.</p>
