			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christian Toto, Washington Times, May 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>What&rsquo;s so unfunny?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what some comics  &mdash;  citing the scarcity of satire directed at President Obama and his administration  &mdash;  want to know.</p>
<p>Claiming that his peers are &#8220;panicky&#8221; about &#8220;being called a racist,&#8221; stand-up legend Jackie Mason said too many once-fearless satirists are settling for &#8220;hero worship&#8221; of the new U.S. president.</p>
<p>The Great Presidential Comedy Drought of 2009 can&rsquo;t be chalked off to a lack of satirical fodder, said comic Jeffrey Jena, founder of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy blog. (&#8220;Looking at politics and life from the right side,&#8221; proclaims its motto.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Letterman used to do a &#8216;Bushism of the Week.&rsquo;&#8221; Why hasn&rsquo;t he started one with Obama?&#8221; Mr. Jena said. &#8220;There&rsquo;s plenty of those moments, the &#8216;Ohs, and &#8216;Umms&rsquo; or &#8216;I don&rsquo;t speak Austrian.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Late Show&#8221; host David Letterman was scathing in his mockery of President George W. Bush. But on his show recently, he scolded those who would mock the new president&rsquo;s reliance on the teleprompter for &#8220;political nitpicking,&#8221; saying Mr. Obama is &#8220;at least out there trying&#8221; to cope with &#8220;impossible&#8221; political challenges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jon Stewart of &#8220;The Daily Show,&#8221; another erstwhile scourge of presidential foibles during the Bush years, has morphed into a political loyalist, rising to the defense of Mr. Obama with angry rants against critics of the president such as CNBC&rsquo;s Jim Cramer and Internet news aggregator (and Washington Times columnist) Andrew Breitbart.</p>
<p>To some, like self-identified Christian comic Brad Stine, the kid-gloves treatment of Mr. Obama is blatant political cheerleading.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because their candidate was elected, they&rsquo;re hesitant to mock that thing which they approve of,&#8221; Mr. Stine said.</p>
<p>Others see comics simply deferring to the sensitivities of audiences who aren&rsquo;t ready to a laugh at a president who&rsquo;s not just a political leader but a transcendent historical symbol of black achievement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Radio and Fox News Channel talk show host Glenn Beck, who kicks off a six-city stand-up comedy tour on June 1 in Denver, suggested that both fear and political calculation are inhibiting factors. Comedians like Mr. Letterman are &#8220;either afraid, or they know the power of comedy as a weapon and they like using it as that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. DiPaolo [comedian Nick DiPaolo], who mixes conservative-friendly material into his act, said the people behind the major entertainment shows &#8220;aren&rsquo;t going to let someone right of center jump into the arena.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Beck said society needs comedians to skewer those in power, no matter the party affiliation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We deflate everybody. As a guy who&rsquo;s been deflated lately, it keeps you in check,&#8221; Mr. Beck said. &#8220;Whoever the president is, they have to know that they&rsquo;re not a king.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Ironically satire is the only way someone can poke fun at our thin skinned President.  We need a new All in the Family for the new milenium.    </p>

			<p>I repeat what I said on a previous article about the guy getting fired for the watermelon patch photo - No public figure is above criticism and ridicule, especially in light of what a hard time these same defenders of Obama gave Mr. Bush. </p>
<p>This is cowardly, hypocritical, and pathetic.</p>

<p>Read that my friends, and then read it again!</p>
<p>The greatest humor, is to be found in the greatest folly; that &ldquo;transcendent historical symbol of black achievement,&rdquo; Comrade BO, is the greatest folly of yesterday&rsquo;s century, only 9 years turned into a new one. Moreover, he distinctly reflects such Red idiots as Comrades Letterman&rsquo;s and Stewart&rsquo;s abysmal worship of a dying dogma, that dominated the last 25 to 30 years of the old century in this country, that has now passed away! </p>
<p>They are supposedly &ldquo;cutting edge,&rdquo; but what edge do they really cut against?</p>
<p>Do they cut against an &ldquo;avant-garde&rdquo; that is obviously retrograde, or do they maintain an antiquated Hollywood Marxism that needed to be extinguished about 75 years ago, so that normal humanity might breath and thrive again?</p>
<p>You be the judge here and never stop laughing!!!</p>

			<p>This is why a black president is, and always will be, a terrible idea. As long as a lack of black accomplishment is defined as something that is done &#8220;to&#8221; blacks (due to &#8220;racism&#8221;) rather than due to their own shortcomings, it will be hard to criticize a black who is elevated to a high position. </p>
<p>And does anybody really think that it begins and ends with Obama? As long as the presuppositions of black innocence / white oppression are held, it will be difficult for any black leader to be criticized. This is the first step towards tyranny.</p>

<p>Oh stop it already!! The explanation is as follows:</p>
<p>1) They are terrified of being called or appearing &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>2) They are still so enamored with their leftist mulatto messiah that they just can&rsquo;t bring themselves to mock their savior. </p>
<p><br>
Simple as that. </p>

			<p> The extreme hesitancy of the likes of Leno and Letterman to lampoon their favorite mulatto is glaringly apparent to anyone who watches their shows. Jay Leno, on the other hand, has come up with a new monologue feature called something like, &#8220;What&rsquo;s President Bush Doing Now,&#8221; designed to ridicule George Bush yet again even though he&rsquo;s been out of office for over three months.</p>
<p> If one googles the one-liners of Will Rogers (a self-proclaimed Democrat) or Bob Hope (well known in the Hollywood of his day as a Republican), one sees that both Rogers and Hope poked fun in a bipartisan manner, sparing no stuffed shirt in the Oval Office, regardless of his hue   &mdash;   political or racial.</p>

			<p>E. B. White&rsquo;s words come to mind:</p>
<p>&#8220;In a free country it is the duty of writers to pay no attention to duty. Only under a dictatorship is literature expected to exhibit a harmonious design or an inspirational tone. A despot doesn&rsquo;t fear eloquent writers preaching freedom &mdash; he fears a drunken poet who may crack a joke that will take hold. His gravest concern is lest gaiety, or truth in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, somewhere gain a foothold, lest joy in some unguarded moment be unconfined.&#8221;</p>

			<p>President Obama is a great study for those who would see how utterly successfull the brainwashing of the leftists worldwide has been on race issues. If your&rsquo;e black in a position of great authority you can&rsquo;t be wrong? You must be given the nth degree of the benefit of the doubt?</p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d treat Obama exactly the same if - as I mentioned previously - his father was a white British colonial administrator in Kenya, right?</p>

<p>To be fair, we must acknowledge that Leno still also makes fun of Bill Clinton&rsquo;s reputation as a womanizer and Hilary Clinton&rsquo;s image as a frigid woman of questionable sexuality.</p>

			<p>Though I have friends who are Democrats and who voted for Obama (for whatever reason - that argument has only been useful for planting the Seed of Doubt), NONE of them has even bothered to disagree with me that the media treats Obama with kid gloves.  After all, isn&rsquo;t virtually any dissent casually dismissed with the tired accusation of &#8220;racism?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hinting at the reason only only begets a grudging admission, or at least no argument, to the implied reason:</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s &#8220;black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow.  The liberals, who have prided themselves on being anti-Racist, have elected, and now duly protect, a candidate, for one reason.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s &#8220;black.&#8221;</p>
<p>The victories abound, my friends.  We have only but to hold fast to the incredible patience we have maintained for decades now.  Our vindication approaches.</p>

			<p>There is a point that has been ignored in the commentary: This political comedy consists of mocking and disparaging not the president, but a caricature of the president. Neither Prez  Clinton&rsquo;s policies nor his competence were targets, only his sexual activities. Similarly, Bush II was derided as the &#8220;moron in the White House&#8221; for eight+ years. Actually, his I.Q. has been estimated by Steve Sailor as between 120 and 130, http://tinyurl.com/3vk2q  <br>
which is about average for presidents (and probably higher then the often disoriented David Letterman). </p>
<p>Therefore. since BO is a member of a protected minority, this type of comedy would not be possible without the incurring the career ending charge of &#8220;Racism&#8221;. Besides, BO is not very mockable. He is monogamous, somewhat articulate, intelligent without being intellectual, and aside from his race and presidency, uninteresting.</p>
<p>His policies do provide great material for ridicule, but this area is totally off limits for the American TV audience.</p>

			<p>I note that any humor about BHO is not directly aimed at him. The Onion had a good one on him. The story claimed that he had committed a double murder in Kansas. The article interviewed various fictional reporters who wondered if a presidential double murder is a newsworthy event.  I think it is hard to get good material on BHO. He is a phantom with no values.</p>

			<p>The thing is this, the people who think they&rsquo;re protecting obama by making it politically incorrect to make fun of him are only going to bring forth more ridicule. They&rsquo;ll be like the Dutch boy trying to plug leaks in the dike with his fingers. Once he plugs one leak another one springs up. Can&rsquo;t be stopped. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I love it. This type of thing is only playing into our hands. Nobody can stop wags. It&rsquo;s never been done in the history of mankind. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you do to people to stop them from poking fun. They&rsquo;re driven to it. Especially with such an easy target. It may not be nice, but it&rsquo;s the way of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting/fun to watch the obamists run around trying to stop this.</p>

			<p>Interesting how those identifying themselves as &#8220;conservatives&#8221; are always accused of spreading a &#8220;chilling&#8221; effect on free speech when it&rsquo;s actually those on the left who react furiously to any criticism, especially comedic criticism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no accident that the most horrific police states in human history have all been creations of the left, which at worst slaughtered their opponents, or at best imprisoned them, in the latter case both literally and also by effectively turning entire nations into a vast prison system, from which no escape was possible.</p>

			<p>I think much of the comedy world is in love with Obama.  They have their mulatto president now and either don&rsquo;t wish to be disrespectful or are afraid of being shunned if they say something mean about him.</p>
<p>Outside of the mainstream media, Obama jokes will flourish.  The vacum created by the PC or shy comedians will be filled by those who dare to cut against the grain.</p>
<p>If Obama really was competant, he could take all manner of racist jokes without missing a beat.  So could his followers.  </p>
<p>The fact that so many people are uncomfortable criticizing him suggests that he is as weak as a kitten in the mental arena.  </p>
<p>Somebody needs to stand up and say, &#8220;The Emperor has no clothes!&#8221;</p>

			<p>Kinda makes you ashamed to be sharing a country with these knaves, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>&#8220;Americans aren&rsquo;t ready.&#8221;  Hmm, plausible at first glance, yes?  So let&rsquo;s test the theory.  The only way they could know this is by experience.  Let&rsquo;s see the Obama jokes bomb with our own eyes.  Then we&rsquo;ll know.  Until then we should assume that it&rsquo;s a lie, an excuse to cover for their bias and cowardice.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be a man of character and make it in the media.</p>

			<p>When you&rsquo;re a comedian &amp; you refuse to go for what&rsquo;s funny, you cede the field don&rsquo;t you?  Obama - bereft of any sense of irony or self-effacement - is the Hoover Dam of political humour.  What will happen when it breaks loose?</p>
