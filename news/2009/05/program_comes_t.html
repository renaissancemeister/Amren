<h1><a href="http://www.canada.com/Health/Program+comes+foreign+nurses/1608727/story.html">Program Comes to Foreign Nurses&rsquo; Aid</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Derek Sankey, Calgary Herald, May 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dharen Brar spent three years earning a diploma to become a registered nurse in India and worked in the intensive care unit of a hospital there before moving to Calgary in 2003.</p>
<p>She knew there would be language barriers to overcome, but she decided to write the English challenge exam anyway. &#8220;I tried to do the English test, but it was a little bit hard,&#8221; says Brar.</p>
<p>She spent some time looking at her options, then she heard about a new program that just launched this May at Bow Valley College. It&rsquo;s called the Integrated Practical Nurse diploma for Internationally Educated Nurses. She was accepted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just want to work in my field because I miss my field  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s been almost 10 years now,&#8221; says Brar. &#8220;I want to be a help to everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>She is among the lucky first group of foreign-trained nurses taking the program, which was designed specifically with a heavy focus on English as a second language and learning the Canadian health-care culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where a lot of immigrants have problems, particularly in the hospital environment, is the rapid-fire language that&rsquo;s necessary in a hospital,&#8221; says Isabel Gibbins, dean of BVC&rsquo;s English as a Second Language department.</p>
<p>&#8220;In emergency situations, you have to comprehend very quickly what&rsquo;s being asked of you and be able to respond very quickly,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>The idea sprang from a pilot program offered at NorQuest College with funding from the province and federal government. Its success prompted officials at Alberta Employment and Immigration to expand the program to other parts of Alberta.</p>
<p>While it might seem like a step down to go from being an RN to licensed practical nurse (LPN), a lot of the students can&rsquo;t get into nursing because of their language skills or lose their jobs because they&rsquo;re not able to communicate at the level required.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you come in as a practical nurse, you&rsquo;re working in the environment, hearing the language, improving your skills and it is possible to then go back and do an RN exam,&#8221; says Gibbins.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what Brar intends to do, perhaps after spending some time in the workforce as an LPN.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s getting closer to your goal than if you didn&rsquo;t have the training and assistance,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>The college is offering an information session Aug. 12 for the next intake, which begins in January 2010. &#8220;We have high hopes for the program,&#8221; says Gibbins.</p>
<p>Potential students are assessed for their qualifications, English abilities and suitability for the program before they are accepted.</p>
<p>With an ongoing shortage of health care workers, especially RNs, and an aging population that will require an increasing amount of health care services, colleges and governments are beginning to invest more in these types of programs, just as they aim to expand the number of seats available to existing Canadians.</p>
<p>&#8220;Predictions are that on the current path we&rsquo;re on, we can&rsquo;t possibly meet our needs for health care workers in the future with our own workers in Canada, so we have to look to other sources,&#8221; says Pamela Nordstrom, director of the Faculty of Nursing at Mount Royal College.</p>
<p>Mount Royal recently partnered with Vancouver-based Intuto Canada Inc. to launch a new website called Englishforhealth.com,which provides internationally educated health professionals with five online tutorials to help them integrate even before they set foot on Canadian soil. &#8220;Sometimes, (immigrants) want to get started prior to even moving to Canada,&#8221; says Nordstrom. &#8220;This is a practical thing they can do to help them when the come here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nuances of English are a big enough challenge, but when you add onto that English within a health care context, it can quickly become bewildering.</p>
<p>Nordstrom says programs such as this one are proactive steps educational institutions are taking to help alleviate the current and forecasted shortage of health professionals, but it doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s only one part of a solution,&#8221; says Nordstrom. &#8220;First, we have to pay attention to making sure that we&rsquo;re getting Canadians who want to become nurses in the system, but we also need to provide support for those who want to move here.&#8221;<br/>

			<p>  The rather simplistic «this therefore that» «logic» which informs the tone of the narrative is terribly exasperating.  Lack of competence in the primary language of the profession in question may be be merely a symptom (or, one of an calendar of symptoms), the basis of which may be an fundamental incompetence to adequately perform  or to discharge the responsabilties of an health care professional, or an physician, or an lawyer, or an engineer.</p>
<p>   Even in circumstances where an physician or an nurse has received training and certification in an third world country, and can speak English,  problems are not, as an consequence, alleviated or resolved.  </p>
<p>  Yesterday evening on «CBC» Television,  an «story» was aired concerning an foreign «qualified» physician (an South African black).  This individual, who could, presumably speak English. (one assumes he spoke the accented South African English dialect, as well as Afrikaans).  </p>
<p>  He was grossly incompentent; he failed the qualifying examination for radiology twice. But, apparently, was allowed to continue to perform radiological examinations. His analyses were grossly in error; an total of 70,000 radiology assessments will have to be reviewed.  To determine whether an proper diagnosis was made. Physicians will have to be drafted from other parts of Saskatchewan (right next door to Alberta), as well as from Alberta, to review the slides. </p>
<p>   This is very expensive, and inefficient; physicians will have to temporarily abandon their practices,  surgeries will be cancelled and re-scheduled,  and, for an agrarian, rural state like Saskatchewan,  the cost will be enormous. </p>
<p>  One also must considers how, in an small population centre of 20,000, serving an rural hinterland of less than 100,000, this individual found the time to conduct 70,000 radiological examinations.  I believe that he was seeking to inflate his billing schedule. Which the taxpayers of Saskatchewan would have to pay. He was attempting to generate income; not adequately discharge his professional responsibilities.</p>
<p>  The «item» concluded with the information that the physician in question «has since returned to South Africa.» And «it is not known whether he will return.» (sic).</p>
<p>  In summary, to assume that proficiency in English will «magically» solve the problems specific to «integrating» foreign born medical «professionals» into «kanadian» medicine, is unreasonable and foolish.  The deficiencies of physicians and medical personal, with «overseas» qualifications will not be addressed or resolved merely by teaching them to speak English. And such an requirement will compound the expense of the ineffective, inefficient «public» system, even further. </p>
<p>  On an personal note; one of my own uncles was an foreign trained physician (Republic of Ireland). And, otherwise as competent as he (apparently)was - and an Anglophone, he could not pass the Ontario «Universal Final Examination» for the foreign born,  either. He was required to practice, under the supervision of an Canadian physician; unless or until he had successfully «passed the test.» </p>
<p> In fact, he could never pass the test (7 yelling, squalling children in the background may have «diminished» he ability to concentrate). He eventually gave up, moved to rural Manitoba, and became a small town country doctor. Manitoba, at that time, waived the «national» testing an licensing requirements; consequent to the «pressing need» to bring «modern medicine» into rural areas. </p>
<p>  He spent the rest of his career dressing burns,  excising benign tumours on ears, and stitching up the occasional cut and slash, on arms and hands, consequent to alcohol fueled «disputes» which occurred in the local beverage rooms. He invariably recorded (to save time and avoid irritating queries from the local constabulary), that such injuries had occurred while the individual concerned had been «skinning a bear.»</p>
<p>  If the Alberta/Bow valley «Health Authority» (sic), believes that teaching nurses and doctors from Bombay and Mysore an modified version of «kanadian» «Hinglish» will alleviate or avoid «medical complications» now or in the future, they are terribly mistaken. </p>

			<p>I recently suffered a stroke and became a patient at Fairfax Nova Hospital.  I found it a real challenge to comprehend the heavily accented English of the nursing staff; especially that of the orientals. The girls were competent and intelligent but I found myself wishing dearly for the attention of American nurses circa 1965.<br/>
