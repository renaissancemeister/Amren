<h1>Hawaii Lawmakers Pass Bill to Create &#8216;Islam Day&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, May 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hawaii&rsquo;s state Senate overwhelmingly approved a bill Wednesday to celebrate &#8220;Islam Day&#8221;  &mdash;  over the objections of a few lawmakers who said they didn&rsquo;t want to honor a religion connected to Sept. 11, 2001.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The resolution to proclaim Sept. 24, 2009, as Islam Day passed the Senate on a 22-3 vote. It had previously passed the House and now goes to Republican Gov. Linda Lingle.</p>
<p>The bill seeks to recognize &#8220;the rich religious, scientific, cultural and artistic contributions&#8221; that Islam and the Islamic world have made. It does not call for any spending or organized celebration of Islam Day.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are a state of tolerance. We understand that people have different beliefs,&#8221; said Sen. Will Espero, a Democrat. &#8220;We may not all agree on every single item and issue out there, but to say and highlight the negativity of the Islamic people is an insult to the majority&#8221; of believers &#8220;who are good law-abiding citizens of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lone Democrat voting against the bill opposed it on church-state separation fears.<br>

			<p>Hawaii appears to be a mess these days.  Its political atmosphere also proves that Asians - by and large - are by no means conservative.  Maybe the older Chinese and Japanese generations were but today&rsquo;s Asian-Americans are loving diversity just as much as the blacks and browns on the mainland in this self-destruction oligarchy.<br>

			<p>If you believe that turtles should be revered, then that religion should be tolerated.  But if your prophet made a living by killing people and taking their caravans, ordered his enemies heads cut off and their women and daughters sold into slavery (being raped every night), said women are worth half a man, and had sex with a nine year old little girl, then that religion should not be tolerated.  Remember, their religion says Muhammad is the &#8220;perfect example of a human being&#8221;. Where are the gay and women&rsquo;s rights group? It is almost like the devil is pulling the strings.</p>

			<p>&#8220;&ldquo;the rich religious, scientific, cultural and artistic contributions&rdquo; that Islam and the Islamic world have made.&#8221;  Yes, let&rsquo;s look at those contributions.  Religious?  The pedophile prophet.  Scientific?  Advanced methods of building human bombs.  Cultural?  Female genital mutilation.  Artistic?  Blood as paint and buildings as canvas.  Yep, he&rsquo;s right.  Gotta admit those Hawaiian legislators are pretty dagum smart!</p>

			<p>To top it off, Sept. 24 of the Gregorian calendar we all use today corresponds to Sept. 11th of the Julian (Byzantine) calendar.  </p>
<p>This idiotic political maneuver is yet another display of ignorance of islam, in a  continuing parade of such.  There is no excuse for such ignorance.</p>
<p>This is a treasonous act in support of enemies who have declared war upon us and are actively prosecuting that war on many levels.  How fitting that this comes from Hawaii, as does (though the claim is yet unproven)  Obama, B. Hussein. </p>

			<p>Please don&rsquo;t confuse the actions of elected officials with the will of the people.  I sincerely doubt that the people of Hawaii want this.  It is the unholy alliance between the media and the political class that allows things like this to happen.</p>

			<p>The 1st Amendment of the US Constitution mandates separation of church and state.  There is no exception for Islam.</p>

			<p>This is how it works. A violent, intolerant, arrogant world-domination movement flies occupied planes into occupied buildings, its members jump up and down and sing for joy in the streets, and it instantly becomes the latest and greatest privileged minority. <br>
Sick.<br>

People in Hawaii must demand &hellip;<br>

			<p>Yes, he&rsquo;s right.  People do have different beliefs.  And democracy isn&rsquo;t one of Islam&rsquo;s beliefs.</p>

			<p>My landlord and his 2 boys just came back after living 3 years in hawaii. The reason he left was because of the racism against Whites.  He had a good job, but the harassement and beatings was just too much for his kids.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s back now, no job and he and his boys crowded into the tiny little in-law apartment in the back.  But at least his kids can go to school in a White suburb where they won&rsquo;t be beaten and bullied for the crime of being White.</p>
