			<p>I find it interesting that a person can be &#8216;Hispanic&rsquo; when the government is handing out racial preferences or taking the census, but the same person will be White when the FBI is compiling crime statistics!</p>

			<p>I had a case where we used a native Guatemalan interpretor.  Instead of the usual short guy with crude facial features, our court interpretor was 6 foot tall with European features.  He was, I believe, a direct descendant of some Conquistador.  Living history. </p>

			<p>The term &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is a totally stupid politically correct designation for ANYONE from Central or South America, although it is sometimes applied to anyone world-wide from a Spanish-speaking country.  Throughout these areas, one can find every type of racial (genetic) mixture, ranging from 100% European to 100% African to 100% Native American to 100% Asian to any degree of mixture.  In fact most people from Central and South America are some sort of mixture.  In a loose sense, the name &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is applied to all of them (because they derive from Spanish-speaking countries)(except for Brazil, Guyana, &amp; French Guiana, of course).  In a strict sense, however, what people really mean by the word &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is someone with native Central or South American genes i.e., either a full-blooded Indian or a mixed-blood Indian &#8220;Mestizo.&#8221;   </p>
<p>The term is totally ridiculous, because its definition varies according to who is using it and because it can include, for example, Blond citizens of Spain, Blond Germans living in Argentina, full blooded South American Indians, full-blooded Japanese living in Peru, Africans living in the Dominican Republic or Brazil, or English-speaking people from Guyana.</p>
<p>In reality, the USA government uses it to describe the mostly mixed-race Mestizos (with mostly Native Central American Indian genes) who have invaded the USA by the tens of millions.  They use the term, because they don&rsquo;t want to use &#8220;Indian&#8221; or &#8220;Mestizo,&#8221; because those terms are &#8220;hateful.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Hispanics aren&rsquo;t a race. There a Cline, a hybridization of European Caucasion types crossed with a varying amount of Mongoloid Amerindians. Ranging from the tall light eyed fair haired cubans and brazillians to short, brown skined, dark haired mexicans and El Salvadorians.</p>

			<p>The ruling and upper classes of Mexico are European Spainish. They apparently also don&rsquo;t believe this multi-cultural nonsense, for they are working as hard as they can to ship their Mestizo lower class to the US. If they can send their least intelligent and productive people to the US and thereby raise the IQ of Mexico, what a plan!</p>

<p>Actually, I have Brazilian-American neighbors (two families), one of Ukrainian heritage, one of Italian-German-Native American heritage and they have advised that they are considered (officially) as &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; for whatever purposes the government or places such as schools consider.  The same for Argentinians of full Italian heritage.  </p>

			<p>Alexandra: Not all Puerto Ricans are of mixed heritage (European and non-European), a lot have married within their own racial group (European) over the generations as large numbers of Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Irish, Portuguese, Scottish and Maltese have settled on the island nation.</p>
<p>One thing that is not well known is that a lot of Spanish and Portuguese have blue eyes. In Portugal the percentage of light eye colours varies from anywhere between 20% and 49%. Spain is much the same except from where the Moors invaded and settled, who brought dominant brown eye colour genes with them.</p>

			<p>Anon 7:22, are you deliberately trying to confuse and distort the issue with irrelevant demographic trivia. Why don&rsquo;t you find me the &#8220;100% white&#8221;, &#8220;100% Asian&#8221;, or &#8220;100% black&#8221; face in that FBI line up? Somehow I see a bunch of average brown Mexicans, and somehow I think they could all recognize each other on sight as Hispanics too. </p>

			<p>The terms Native Indian and Mestizo (Mestizo means mixed) describe the majority of the people south of the USA better than the vague word &#8220;Hispanic,&#8221; which is undoubtedly why it is used.  Anything to cloud awareness of White racial dispossession.  This way, asleep at the wheel Americans will think of &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; as Spaniards, with just the TEENIEST, TINIEST bit of Native Indian or black mixed in.  </p>
<p>Subliminal indoctrination from Big Government:  &#8220;You have nothing to worry about; these hardworking people won&rsquo;t change America&rsquo;s culture or future destiny because they&rsquo;re primarily Caucasians, just like you!  Soon your grandchildren will marry their grandchildren and everything will be peachy!&#8221; </p>
<p>The next step will be to call the Blacks of the Caribbean &#8220;English&#8221; because their islands used to be English colonies and they speak English (sort of).</p>

			<p>The term Hispanic comes from the island of Hispaniola, which comprises Haiti and the Dominican Republic, of course. I think Haiti should not be considered a part of Latin America, because Spanish or Portuguese is not the official language there. Instead, Haiti, Jamaica, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, Bahamas, Grenada and ALL other non-Spanish or Portuguese-speaking jurisdictions should be regarded as &#8220;Euro-Caribbean&#8221;, without regard to what language is spoken.</p>
<p>Let me group it, this way:</p>
<p>Latin American - </p>
<p>All majority Spanish or Portuguese-speaking nations, and dependencies</p>
<p>Euro-Caribbean - </p>
<p>Suriname<br>
French Guyana<br>
Bahamas<br>
Belize<br>
U.S. Virgin Islands<br>
British Virgin Islands<br>
Grenada<br>
Guyana<br>
Aruba<br>
St, Kitts-Nevis<br>
Barbados<br>
Haiti<br>
Jamaica,</p>
<p>and all other non-majority Spanish or Portuguese speaking nations and dependencies</p>
<p>Any thought and comments, fellow Amrenners?  </p>

			<p>&#8220;Anon 7:22, are you deliberately trying to confuse and distort the issue with irrelevant demographic trivia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kind Sir, you misunderstand me.  I am making the point that &#8220;officially&#8221; the term &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; can include Europeans, Asians, and Africans living in Central and South America.  But, in reality, 95% of the &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; illegally crossing USA borders are in fact Mestizos (mixed-blooded Native New World Indians) or full-blooded New World Indians.  But, it is not PC to call them what they are (i.e., New World Indians), because that would be &#8220;racist.&#8221;  Instead, our government uses the very bland and ambiguous term &#8220;Hispanic.&#8221;  It is the same trick as when they group low-IQ Samoans and Papua New Guineans with high-IQ Japanese in the meaningless term &#8220;Asian/Pacific Islander.&#8221;  These 3 races could not be more different from one-another. Note also that when reporting those who commit crimes, &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; are counted as &#8220;Whites&#8221; (= European-Americans)   But the truth is that &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; are NOT &#8220;White&#8221;, but are mostly Native New World Indians. Our government tries to hide the truth.  It does not want us to know that low-IQ Indians from Central America have invaded the USA and are committing crimes.  Hence they classify them as &#8220;Hispanic,&#8221; and then combine them with &#8220;Whites&#8221; when reporting crimes.</p>

			<p>Yes, Hispanic is a pretty useless term for description of race.  It&rsquo;s like &#8220;Turkish&#8221;, which is also a racial non-descriptor.  Ethnic Turks in parts of Turkey - the Circassians for instance - look totally white, while in western China (Singkiang) they look quite Oriental.</p>

			<p>In California, I was classified as Hispanic by my company&rsquo;s HR department, due to my having a grandfather from Spain. Being classified as Hispanic never helped me get a job (I don&rsquo;t look mestizo), but it helped my company in the affirmative actions sweepstakes to show that they had &#8216;n&rsquo; number of Hispanics in responsible positions. </p>
<p>I did apply for jobs with companies who, as part of the pre-screening process, asked my race. I didn&rsquo;t get a call from any for which I listed my race as Hispanic rather than white. </p>

			<p>So in crime statistics hispanics are considered white?  So how does all that work? Ive never studied crime statistics.  When statistics regarding rape and murder for example are considered say at the national level,  Do the statistics show that whites committed a certain percentage or number of murders when in fact a portion of that is hispanics?  Are these statistics intentionally distorted by the classification of hispanics as white?  </p>

<p>Sir, we are in agreement. I am also in agreement with Anonymous at 9:49 AM who said: </p>

<p>Enough about the &#8220;totally white Cuban neighbor&#8221; or the &#8220;Ukrainian Brazilian co worker.&#8221; These exceptions are a drop in the bucket in a sea of brown Mexicans who are in no way white. </p>
<p>Not only that, I advise that posters here take a closer look at their &#8220;100% Spanish&#8221; acquaintance and find out what real Spaniards look like. Remember that those &#8220;100% Castilian&#8221; friends are in reality part of the very real &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; race and voting bloc that is dispossessing Anglo Saxon America. They benefit from your failure to recognize them as a unified racial bloc that wants your country. </p>

<p>Yes, you are quite correct &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; are not all of the same race - it is just a term for anyone who has ever lived in a Spanish speaking country or Spanish speaking community.</p>
<p>The rich elites of Mexico are very White and very racially conscious - though they play the game of being on the same side as the Mestizo masses and hating the American Anglos - the Mexican White elites strategy is to export as many poor mixed race Mestizos and even poorer Indians out of their country so there isn&rsquo;t a popular revolution against the White rich Mexican elite.</p>
<p>Spain is of course a White European country - though Spaniards are often considered darker, less White than Northern White Nordic Europeans. This is because of racial mixture from Arab Muslim Moors who occupied Spain for 700 years - same problem with Sicily.</p>
<p>As recently as 50 years ago, an &#8220;American&#8221; was perceived in the world as an English speaking White person with many common cultural characteristics.</p>
<p>Now an &#8220;American&#8221; could be just about anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hispanic&#8221; means anyone from a Spanish speaking South or Central American country.  Some of those people are of entirely or nearly entirely European ancestry.  But most of the Hispanics who pour across our borders are Mestizos, with a substantial (and sometimes majority) Indian ancestry.  The elites in Mexico are largely white.  Is it any surprise they are happy to see the half breeds move up here, and out of their own country?<br>

			<p>&#8220;So in crime statistics hispanics are considered white?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes!  In some City, State, and Federal crime reports, &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; are counted as &#8220;White&#8221; if they are the perpetrator, but as Hispanics if they are the the victim.  The &#8220;supposed&#8221; reason for this is because a victim may not always be able to tell who his aggressor was (the crime may have happened too fast and the perpetrator is gone).  In contrast, the police can always ask a victim what their race is.  The result is that &#8220;Whites&#8221; appear to commit a higher number of crimes, when in reality, it is the Mestizo invaders who are actually committing many of these crimes.  Even when a Mexican-American kills another Mexican-American, that will sometimes be &#8220;officially&#8221; reported as a &#8220;White-on-Hispanic&#8221; crime, once again, distorting reality.  Not all law-enforcement offices do this, but many do.  Some people (liberals, Democrats, socialists, and communists) favor this kind of lying, because they want to hide this nasty fact.</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Are these statistics intentionally distorted by the classification of hispanics as white?</p>
<p>Yes! The distortion is deliberate! On the part of the federal government agencies to downplay the extent and amount of crime by Hispanics (generally illegal Mexican or other Latin American immigrants). By the pretense that Whites rather than Latin Americans commit so many rapes and murders, American citizens are kept in the dark. So the citizen/voters don&rsquo;t get the idea to pressure Congress to seal the borders. Which would hurt the corporations and businesses thriving from hiring cheap (illegal immigrant) labor.</p>

			<p>The terms hispanic or latino are somewhat of a misnomer. Lets go back 600 years. There was a pure indian population in north, central and south america who was conquered by the spanish from the lower USA to the tip of south America. Remember at the time the Spanish were the worlds superpower.  The english and to a far lesser extent the french conquered what is now the USA and Canada . The Portuguese took Brazil. As armies often do, they mixed over the next 600 years until today most have at least some blood of indian and european. The lower classes today consist of pure indian to a darker mix. The upper classes in spanish speaking countries consist of pure european to a slightly darker but still white mix, kind of an italian looking mix. As long as the whites are in charge there are few problems, but when the darkers use democratic principles to come to power such as Hugo Chavez or Morales in Bolivia they seem to quickly adhere to communist principles. One notable exception is Castro who is a white. I lived in Costa Rica and now live part time in Colombia and learned to speak spanish. CR has an economy based on tourism and a little bit of exports such as coffee, bananas ect and is firmly controlled by the whites, although they have no army which may be a good thing, without an army to overthrow the gov they have been revolution free since 1948. Colombia is a very different country than CR. Little tourism and as the country was shut off from the world for 40ish years due to attempted communist takeover by the FARC, Colombia became self sufficient in many areas and now with the FARC all but beaten has an economy that is blossoming wonderfully. Construction cranes in every direction. A strong right wing president. An army that could easily wipe out Chavez, and Chavez knows it. Colombia is the worlds largest exporter of flowers, coffee, and possibly emeralds. It has gold and oil, just not as much oil as Hugo. Colombia is the best freind of the USA in all of SA but since it is a right wing country gets no airtime by the left wing press while commie Hugo is a press darling. Not fair, but the way it is. But back to the people. In Medellin, where I live there are probably 25% indian, 40%mixture, and probably 20% who look pure white. Then there is a smattering of africans, maybe 5% and some aisian/pakistani looking types. Colombia is a country that deserves a second look for any of you interested in moving out of the USA if things get too bad here. Africans have no power there and there is no AA as far as I know. The economy is good with western living standards. And whites are firmly right wing and in charge,, at least for the forseeable future.  KF               </p>

			<p> Just the other day I was watching a crime show on the History channel, the suspect was an illegal alien who senselessly shot a mother of two in a botched robbery attempt. <br>
 I laughed out loud as they showed the murder suspect a dark, small, punk with a shaved head&hellip; listed under his race was &#8220;White&#8221;. I actually paused the TV and took a picture, emailed the picture to a couple of friends for a good laugh. These statistics are truly garbage in, garbage out.. they are made to distort the true color of crime.<br>

			<p>Yes, Hispanic is a pretty useless term for description of race. It&rsquo;s like &ldquo;Turkish&rdquo;, which is also a racial non-descriptor. Ethnic Turks in parts of Turkey - the Circassians for instance - look totally white, while in western China (Singkiang) they look quite Oriental.</p>
<p>____</p>
<p>Original Turks were quite Caucasoids. Those who speak Turkic (not Turkish of Turkey) languages such as Singkiang, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, etc&hellip; but look Oriental are mixed with Mongolians.</p>
<p>As a full blooded Turk, I can say, Anatolian Turks are among the most ethnically (not racially) diverse people on earth. Circassians form one of the biggest group (around 1 mil.) They weren&rsquo;t Turkish, they arrived in Anatolia after being ousted from the Caucasus by Russians in the 17th century, but integrated quite well, many politicians, soldiers, etc.. were and are of Circassian origin.</p>
<p>Circassian women were sultan&rsquo;s favorite because of their porcelain white skin. The famous German anthropologist Blumenbach named the white race after the people of Caucasus because of their beauty (especially Georgians but Circassians as well).</p>

<p>&#8220;Spain is of course a White European country - though Spaniards are often considered darker, less White than Northern White Nordic Europeans. This is because of racial mixture from Arab Muslim Moors who occupied Spain for 700 years - same problem with Sicily.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the more popular myths handed down from generation to generation is that Southern Europe was a place filled with blonde-haired, blue-eyed, fair-skinned peoples until all those dark-skinned Moors came and changed the complexion of the place.  It&rsquo;s incredible how many still buy into that canard.</p>
<p>Fact: when the Romans first arrived in what is now Spain they encountered large numbers of people with dark curly hair, brown eyes and olive skin (just as they did in England &amp; Scotland, by the way, but in fewer numbers).  </p>
<p>Early physical anthropologists termed these peoples &#8220;Mediterraneans&#8221; due to their unique phenotypes.  Frescos and writings of Classical writers indicate these peoples were found throughout Southern Europe.  It is now believed they were the descendants of the pre-Indo-European inhabitants of Europe who came over during the Neolithic.  It was they who introduced agriculture &amp; civilization to Europe.</p>

That these peoples were able to thrive where they did is hardly a mystery.  Southern Europe is hotter, dryer and a lot sunnier than Northern Europe.  As such, you would not expect to find large numbers of fair-haired, light-eyed, fair-skinned peoples living in such a place (at least relative to darker peoples) due to the fact they are not acclimated to the place.  Modern conveniences, of course, have changed things considerably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moor&#8221;, like Hispanic, is not a racial term.  It encompassed a wide group of peoples, but most of them are known to have been Berbers (with Arab rulers); Caucasoid peoples, who while not Europeans, are closely related.</p>
<p>http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Moors</p>
<p>While there can be no doubt there are people scattered throughout Southern Europe who show resemblances to Moorish invaders, they are hardly the norm.  The same can be said for peoples living in Northern Europe who look like this.</p>
