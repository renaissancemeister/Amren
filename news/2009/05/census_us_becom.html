			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Les Christie, CNN, May 14, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau reported Thursday that the minority population reached an estimated 104.6 million  &mdash;  or 34% of the nation&rsquo;s total population  &mdash;  on July 1, 2008, compared to 31% when the Census was taken in 2000. Nearly one in six residents, or 46.9 million people, are Hispanic, the agency reported.</p>
<p>Even more telling for the future: 44% of children under age 18 and 47% of children under the age of five are now from minority families.</p>
<p>The quickly expanding Latino population is having a healthy impact on the economy, according to Ken Gronbach, author of &#8220;The Age Curve: How to Profit from the Growing Demographic Trend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Latinos have saved our country,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They represent 14% of the population but 25% of the live births. The United States is the only western industrialized nation with a fertility rate above the 2.2% replacement rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Growth of other minority groups is also outpacing that of the majority population. Asians, the second-fastest growing group, increased 2.7% year-over-year to 15.5 million. The African-American population rose 1.3% to 41.1 million.</p>
<p>Minority births, combined with high immigration levels, kept the nation&rsquo;s population growing dynamically, spurring the economy by adding to consumer demand.</p>
<p>They will also help to prop up the real-estate market once the economy begins to recover, according to Rakesh Kochhar, associate director of the Pew Hispanic Center/ {snip}</p>
<p>As it ages, the Baby Boom generation, the largest age cohort in U.S. history, will start to sell their castles as they look to downsize their empty nests. But the group that would be expected to buy those houses, Generation X, has about 9 million fewer members.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Minorities will help take up that slack. They are relatively youthful and looking to house their families. The Hispanic population, for example, posted a median age of 27.7 years in 2008. That compared to 36.8 years for the total U.S. population  &mdash;  which is a year-and-a-half older than the median age in 2000.</p>
<p>The number of 65-year-olds and older is nearing 39 million, or 12.8% of the population, up from 12.4% in 2000. {snip}</p>
<p><b>Biggest minority</b></p>
<p>Latinos and other minority workers contribute to keeping the Social Security system solvent, according to Monique Morrissey, an economist for the Economic Policy Institute. The undocumented workers among them often pay more into the Social Security pool than they will take out in benefits.</p>
<p>Morrissey said estimates of deficits in the pool&rsquo;s finances were reduced last year when a Social Security advisory board&rsquo;s technical panel revised some unrealistically low assumptions it had made about Latino immigration.</p>

		<p>We are supposed to cheer when we &#8220;reduce our carbon footprint&#8221; but also to cheer when Hispanics and immigrants come into the country to drive more cars, use more water and electricity and fill up our schools. To translate: whites should use less of everything so there are more resources to bring in more foreigners. Umm, Great.</p>

Who will the U.S. import next to prop up Grandpa Chan or Hernandez? What will the (white) environmentalists say when the forests, swamps and wildlands and all their inhabitants they so devotedly protect are consumed by the out-of-control immigration and birth-rates of the U.S.?</p>

		<p>The lies overwhelm me.  Ignorant, violent minorities that have cultural aversions to White norms of behavior are going to save the country?  Their going to buy the McMansions of the baby boomers, keeping up the neighborhoods of course, and thereby finance the boomers extravagant retirements?  Most of these people couldn&rsquo;t have graduated from a typical American high school, circa 1960, and they&rsquo;re going to sustain a First World nation?  And just what non-White slums have these experts chosen to live in, to better enjoy this salvation?</p>

<p>What a joke. It simply means the USA is well on its&rsquo; way to becoming a 3rd world Latin American country. Take a good look at Mexico, Mr. Gronbach, that&rsquo;s what it will be. The USA will exist in name only but will no longer be the same country. (Gronbach is a German name, what&rsquo;s wrong with whites)<br>

<p>Jeepers Comrade Gronbach, remind me to never shout to you for a lifejacket if I am drowning!</p>
<p>It always amazes me, when an &ldquo;educated&rdquo; idiot such as Comrade Gronbach makes these abjectly ludicrous proclamations about demographic trends, even in the best of times. However, in the current economic crisis, what the USA most certainly does not need is an ever expanding horde of entitlement seekers, who cannot even speak English. Right now, the USA needs a: coherent, cohesive, and composed  population. </p>
<p>We do not need 25% of live births being made up of low IQ aliens, spawned by parents that are best described kindly as incompetent interlopers!</p>
<p>Better the country should have the population drop back down to 275 million or less, when that is considered!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>Another one of these simplistic, pro-population growth articles, crowing about the staggering increase in the non-white population of course.  If these trends are leading us into utopia then California should be the most desirable state to live in the United States right now.  Obviously, it is just the opposite yet this article does not mention any downsides to these trends.</p>
<p>The most imbecilic statement in the article &ldquo;Latinos have saved our country,&#8221; again harps on the adulation of third world populations and associated living standards within our lifetimes.  If Ken Gronbach wants a taste of the future perhaps he should move to Mexico City so he can savor its crime, squalor, and pollution.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this CNN article does not meet the standards of professional journalism; rather it is a globalist propaganda piece that should have never been published.</p>

		<p>The increase in population the mestezos burden us with means we will have a larger percentage of less intelligent people, more crime and poverty, and a dangerous lack of food, water and natural resources, more polution, more smog, more environmental contamination, etc.</p>
<p>So, if that merits a &#8220;thank you&#8221; according to left wing whackos, then they have just made it more apparent with one more item just why they are referred to as brainless kooks and whackos.</p>

		<p>In the 1950&rsquo;s, America&rsquo;s Liberal intellectual leaders were fretting over population growth. The cause were the &#8220;evil&#8221; Catholics who refused to practice contraception. They predicted the population would exceed 250,000,000 by the end of the century; this was far in excess of what America&rsquo;s environment could sustain. </p>
<p>Today the Liberals sing a different tune. With a population in excess of 300,000,000 and pressing environmental degradation, an increasing population has become a good for the U.S. because of (short term) economic benefits. Any mention of the environmental impact is labelled &#8220;Racist&#8221; by the Liberals.</p>
<p>The rule seems to be that Liberal intellectuals decide what they want, and then come up with propaganda to promote it. They didn&rsquo;t like the (1950&rsquo;s) Catholic church, so it was destroying the environment. They like non-White immigration, so it&rsquo;s saving the economy.  </p>

&#8220;&hellip;They will also help to prop up the real-estate market once the economy begins to recover, according to Rakesh Kochhar&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t this already tried with disastrous results?</p>
<p>Is this not the same idiot that warned us in an article last night to NOT connect hispanics and immigrants with high foreclosure rates?</p>
<p>Said he:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;The two things appear together, but is there a causal relationship? Not necessarily,&rsquo; he said&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Who would hire such a fool to author any report?  How does Rakesh expect a low IQd, high fertility population group, one that is highly dependent on government services to suddenly become responsible home owners capable of paying the mortgage, upkeep, and insurance on a home?</p>
<p>Here are a few facts about the group he is championing as a replacement for White Americans:</p>
<p>Per capita income of Hispanics is one half that of non-Hispanic whites, and household net worth is less than one tenth.</p>
<p>Fifty percent of Hispanic households use some form of welfare, the highest rate of any major population group.</p>
<p>Hispanics drop out of high school at three times the white rate.</p>
<p>Even third-generation Hispanics drop out of school at a higher rate than blacks and are less likely to be college graduates.</p>
<p>The average Hispanic 12th-grader reads and does math at the level of the average white 8th-grader.</p>
<p>Source:  Hispanics:  A Statistical Report.</p>
<p>THIS is the population group that Rakesh (and the government) believes is going to successfully replace Whites?  Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Rakesh is welcome to visit California where he can see first-hand what happens when a safe, clean, crime-free White community is taken over by hispanics.  These communities become high-density, gang-ridden, graffiti-covered, trash-filled hell-holes marked by run down houses with weed-filled yards, streets with non-operative cars on blocks, dogs running wild, street vendors selling every type of un-regulated food from carts.  </p>
<p>All of the schools are failures with huge drop-out rates as it is futile to educate those with average IQs of 90 past a rudimentary level.  </p>
<p>In other words, hispanics recreate normal hispanic conditions wherever they settle, reproducing the conditions of mexico and central america.  Many hispanic areas of Los Angeles are interchangeable with cities in mexico down to the corruption of the locally elected government officials.  </p>
<p>Rakesh can have it  &mdash;  all of it.  But then I strongly suspect HE lives in a nice, clean, quiet White area&hellip;</p>

<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know about the country, but I do know about my personal finances. As I wrote a few blogs back, I have had a car stolen, car stereo, my side window broken at a park by some gangbanger latino that I and my dogs were too far away to get at, and an expensive bike. So, for me at least, Latino&rsquo;s have save me nothing  &mdash;  but sure cost me. I know liberals would get offended and accuse me of something, though I couldn&rsquo;t imagine what, I&rsquo;m just recounting what Latino&rsquo;s have done for me, etc.</p>

		<p>What minorities have saved is the justification for large government and non-profit organizations to feed of productive US citizens.</p>
<p>No government or organization wants to participate in any country or economy that is not expanding. The whole system, taxes, fire departments, federal reserve, police departments, taxes, regulations, laws, lawyers, federal reserve, medical industry, taxes, etc are built on the foundation of an ever expanding economy to hide inflation, tax bracket creep, and the destruction of the middle class. </p>
<p>But it is time to take responsibility: the white man gave it all away and lost his will to live. The tax system, immigration, the declining cultural and religious state of America ALL occurred under the management and control of the white man.</p>
<p>The question is where or when will leadership come forward to rebuild America OR where is the next great Western Civilization going to be located?</p>
<p>Before we can move forward we must take responsibility for our decline.</p>

<p>This is like saying that AIDS saved the country by directing funds into the health-care industry.  Or like saying fatherless families are saving the country by allowing fathers to devote more time to their careers of crime and indolence, which, incidentally, provide increased funding for law-enforcement agencies.</p>

		<p>From about 1955 to 1975 the liberals were weeping, wailing and caterwauling that children were ruining America.  How will we feed, shelter and employ them?  Furthermore it is a crime against the environment and its precious weeds and worms to have children.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t there a book written by one of the population control &#8220;experts&#8221; that mass famine would strike  by 1980?</p>
<p>Paul Erlich wrote it.  &#8220;The Population Bomb&#8221;  1968.</p>
<p>But now we suddenly need to increase our population by 100 million every 10 years.  Thank God the mass media is going under.</p>

		<p>SOMEONE HAS SAVED OUR COUNTRY?  That&rsquo;s great news, considering most of us thought we were in the biggest economic slump since the Great Depression.  Brand new houses in heavily hispanic towns are being bulldozed because they are unsellable, but the hispanics are saving us?</p>
<p>Or maybe &#8220;saved&#8221; means something so elusive a dumb redneck like me can&rsquo;t grasp it&hellip;.kinda like when I have trouble grasping how hispanics have &#8220;family values&#8221; that (according to W) are somehow more valid than my American family values.</p>
<p>Our present economic difficulties have everything to do with the percentage of &#8216;Americans&rsquo; who are now minorities.  They have, apparently, reached critical mass&hellip;.they are here in sufficient numbers, now, that we whites can no longer absorb/compensate for their presence with our industriousness and prudence.  As a Mississippian, I can attest to the enormous drag non-whites place on the machine of commerce.  Virtually my whole family got out of this state, moved to whiter places, and got rich.  </p>
<p>Nothing good was happening in Mississippi, because there were so many &#8216;minorities&rsquo;.  Minorities slow everything down, and make everything so hard to do, it&rsquo;s like trying to run through molasses.  My cousins blossomed in those white places, because they no longer had to fight that huge minority drag.  One cousin in Colorado said being out of Mississippi was like suddenly being free of gravity.  Everything was so easy, because everybody was so white.</p>
<p>I thrived here, only because my dealings are as much international as local.  But now, the world is in a big slump, and, while I&rsquo;m doing fine right now, I&rsquo;m beginning to worry.  I think the world is in a slump, because whites are now less than ten percent of the world&rsquo;s total population.  In the Gilded Age, we were around 25%.  We created the prosperity, but 10% cannot create enough prosperity (in economic terms, &#8216;surplus&rsquo;) to compensate for the deficiencies of the other 90%.</p>
<p>Worse than the total numbers is the fact that there is no nation on earth that is now totally white.  Browns are gumming up the mechanism everywhere.  EVERYWHERE!  Even Switzerland is being overrun.</p>
<p>But back to this article&rsquo;s central premise:  would someone please define &#8220;saved&#8221;?</p>

		<p>I believe that the current economic crisis that has wrecked economies throughout the World is traceable to one fact:<br>
  - Millions of Americans couldn&rsquo;t pay their mortgages.<br>
 Now, as tis report tellus, the USA, alone amongst developed nations has experience massive population growth.All of this growth is due to the (massive, non-White) immigration the authors of this report so laud - &#8220;It&rsquo;s saved the nation!&#8221; they scream.<br>
  Now, if some many immigrants never arrived, so many new houses would never have needed to be built (perhaps that cash would have been invested in more fruitful industries).If the houses were never built in the first place, so much wouldn&rsquo;t have been borrowed in mortgages that will never be paid back.<br>
 Perhaps the whole housing/mortgage bubble that wrecked the USA (and the rest of the World), would never have got started in the first place! So much for immigrants &#8216;saving&rsquo; the USA!<br>
  Just an opposing thesis to the conventional wisdom, bu deceit and lies must be challenged wherever we find them, as unfortunately they tend to become the &#8216;conventional wisdom&rsquo;.</p>

From margaret:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Paul Erlich wrote it. &ldquo;The Population Bomb&rdquo; 1968&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I well remember in the 70s having to read &#8216;The Population Bomb&rsquo; for two classes in high school and two in college  &mdash;  the college courses were entirely centered around Erilich&rsquo;s specious book.  Anyone who questioned Erlich&rsquo;s dogma was guaranteed a non-passing grade and was labeled as an &#8216;idiot&rsquo;, &#8216;ignorant&rsquo; and/or &#8216;uninformed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Erlich advocated:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; that population sacrifices must first begin in the U.S. He dismissed the responsibility of the two most populous countries, China and India, from having to adopt the drastic steps he advocated the U.S. must first take&hellip;.  One proposal often mentioned, according to Ehrlich, was &#8216;the addition of temporary sterilants [sic] to water supplies or staple food&rsquo; in order to achieve a zero population growth&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I recall how that stupid book was looked up to at the time as if it were akin to The Bible  &mdash;  however, as the Bible was very much out of favor on university campuses (or is it campi?), &#8216;The Population Bomb&rsquo; was the surrogate.</p>
<p>Of course, the book, by design, was aimed at Whites in order to scare them into limiting themselves to having either one, or preferably, no children.  What better way to limit, possibly eradicate the White population than to push this book and the 1965 immigrant flood bill?</p>
<p> Looks like it worked.</p>
<p>And, like Margaret Mead, Erlich&rsquo;s theories so lauded and praised at the time proved to be entirely bogus.  </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting note:</p>
<p>The Intercollegiate Review put together a list of the 50 worst books of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>According to Paul Greenburg, the books:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; had to have been &#8216;widely celebrated in their day but which upon reflection can be seen as foolish, wrong-headed, or even pernicious.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>Margaret Mead&rsquo;s book took top honors, with The Population bomb not far behind.</p>
<p>From the review:</p>
<p>  &mdash;   Paul Ehrlich&rsquo;s &#8216;The Population Bomb,&rsquo; which was all the rage in 1968, when it predicted that &#8216;hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death&rsquo; in the 1970s. .. The great famines of the 20th Century have been largely man-made, going under names like Mao&rsquo;s Great Leap Forward and Stalin&rsquo;s collectivization.</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/pcggap" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/pcggap</a></p>

<p>I appreciate your airing of this set of ideas.  I would like to point out something that often escapes the myopic, shoot-from-the-hip comment style; the rest of the &#8220;industrialized world&#8221; does not have a similar housing crisis.  The housing crisis was created by both left and right actors - that is, international capitalists and socialist reformers with both playing with the lives of ordinary people who just want to get a roof over their heads and also wish to imagine that government is overall working for them, not against them.  Recall that home ownership was regarded as a more sound financial model for EVERYONE as it leads to more stable neighborhoods, etc., by the Bush Administration AND the left.  But capitalists figured out how to dupe the average would be homeowner as others - most often Christian Conservative (in my own experience) realtors justified every kind of lie to make another sale.  Still others, (usually also of the New Christian Prosperity model) figured out how to make quick profits by &#8220;flipping&#8221; properties while the boom lasted.</p>
<p>So when we take the time to analyze the entire situation, we can find bad actors in every corner.  Meanwhile, my friend in Europe continues to go on nice vacations, receiving ongoing free health care that has stablized a very agressive form a cancer, while over nine years fathering more children and building a nice, new home without increasing his personal debt and ruining his life.  He has also been working part time at this government job for during his nearly nine years of ongoing cancer treatment.  He is a very happy man today.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we deny ourselves any such personal comforts and successes, blame each other and pretend that we are a great country that goes about the world, actively promoting democracy using non-extistent wealth and the blood of our best predominantly White male youth.</p>

		<p>I was interviewed by CNN&rsquo;s Les Christie for the above article. Once the story hit I began to get hate mail. It is very clear to me that many people do not understand the dynamics of shifting demography and the importance of understanding it. Between 1965 and 1984 the number of babies born in the United States dropped like a stone owing to a misguided belief that &#8220;Zero Population Growth&#8221; was beneficial. Roe vs. Wade (1973) also played a significant part and our fertility plummeted twenty-five percent after the Supreme Court decision. In 1985 we began to have children again at above replacement level fertility, but the damage was done. </p>
<p>We have a deficit in our population that is twenty years long. It&rsquo;s called Generation X. Generation X has nine million fewer people than the Boomer Generation born 1945 to 1964. This means that Generation X can not earn, consume, pay taxes or populate the labor force at the level of the baby Boomers because they simply do not have the critical mass.</p>
<p>When Generation X entered the entry level labor market twenty years ago they could not satisfy the demand. This sent labor costs soaring and jobs off shore.  Latino&rsquo;s poured into the country to fill the demand unmet by Generation X. Now the bad economy and our own homegrown labor force, Generation Y, born 1985 to 2004 is forcing millions of Latinos to return to their home countries. The remaining Latinos have conveniently filled in the deficit in our population between the ages of twenty-five and forty-four years old. </p>
<p>As Generation X, now fortified by the remaining Latino immigrants, ages into the stage of life when they will be required to do the heavy lifting in the United states by paying most of the federal, state and local taxes, it is paramount that the Latinos immigrants assimilate as quickly as possible. Most of this assimilation will occur naturally because their culture is very compatible with U.S. culture and they assimilate faster than any other immigrants in the Nation&rsquo;s history. Without the Latino immigrants our economy would crash in ten years making the current economic crisis look like a cake walk.<br>

              You write a load of rubbish - I am unashamed to say.<br>
 The fact is that average take home salaries for American workers have not increased at all since at least 1972 - so much for your notion that wages &#8216;soared&rsquo; due to a deficiency of workers.<br>
  If you care to study the paper written by Robert Rector et al. a few years back you will see that low skilled, low wage Mexican labor is in fact an economic liability to the USA in that taxes paid on the low money earned by Mexicans is insufficent to cover their manifold and expensive state-funded entitlements including welfare, medicare, medicaid, education, law enforcement etc.<br>
   In fact the state of California - with its horrific state finances bears this point out. California has mass unemployment (around 12% of the workforce), coupled with a horrible income distribution, in which something like only 5% of the top earners contribute 90% of all the taxes! - this is the economic profile of a classic third world nation and not an advanced society.<br>
 All down to mass immigration.</p>

		<p>Ken Grombach is foolish enough to believe, or dishonest enough to claim, that the masses of Mexican invaders are an adequate substitute for Whites.  He also says that they are the most assimilable of foreigners.  How can anyone imagine that a people so averse to education can sustain a modern society?  And how could anyone think that a people so rich in social pathologies, drunkenness, violence, irresponsible breeding, and all-around slothfulness for a start, are more assimilable than Europeans, or even Filipinos?  Particularly when they are taught that the Southwest is theirs by right, that Whites are interlopers who have no right to object to immigration. and expect us to accommodate them and their dysfunction?  <br>
     I think this is dishonesty, not foolishness.  I see in the news, for example, that the White voters of Mexico Norte did not pass a bunch of tax increases on the ballot, and Governor Schwartzenegger is pushing for big cuts in services.  The White goose that laid the golden eggs has been killed, and the Powers that Be are scrambling to deal with the consequences.  They are in too deep to admit their guilt, they are cornered, but all they can do is try to lie their way out and hope that enough people will buy it.  </p>

		<p>Ken Grombach is spouting nonsense about the labor market.  As Kenelm Digby points out, if there had been a labor shortage, wages would have increased, which did not happen.  And if there were a labor shortage, there are ways to deal with it that don&rsquo;t require the displacement of Americans by 3rd World or foreign techies.  <br>
     First on my list would be to cut funding for four year colleges.  Rather than educating people, they are primarily academic resorts where kids can slide along, outside of the labor market, by taking some classes and regurgitating their professors platitudes.  Abolish most of it, including the business departments, support science and engineering, and let the professors find real jobs.   Anyone who wants a liberal education can read serious books, something most adults, college grads or not, do not do.  Let the English and History departments remain open for that fraction of students who really show a desire for knowledge.  The rest of the kids can go to trade schools or apprenticeships.  Allow businesses to use tests, like the military does, to sort out job candidates instead of degrees.  Right there you&rsquo;ve got a few million young people out of the classroom and into the labor market.  <br>
     Second would be to reduce restrictions on small businesses.  For example, why should a mom have to get a license and put in a stainless steel kitchen in order to run a little day care operation for a half dozen kids?  <br>
     Third would be to encourage people to keep working.  That people ought work for 30 years and ride on the labor of others for another 20 or 30 is unsustainable, especially when they want a &#8220;comfortable&#8221; retirement that involves lots of golf and travel.  Instead of importing foreigners to &#8220;do the heavy lifting&#8221; of paying for social security and so on, older people should work part time.  They get paid something, they pay some taxes, they alleviate some of the labor shortage, and they have something better to do than sit around and talk about their aces and pains.  Instead of being  Old People, they remain just people, part of the community, deserving of respect rather than condescension.  <br>
     Fourth, we can follow the Japanese example and build machines to do more work. <br>
     Mr Gronbach seems to follow the ideology that endless growth is necessary for prosperity, and that the problems can be postponed indefinitely, or at least until he and his friends can get clear.  In fact, our immigration policies are the worst idea since African slavery, with even worse consequences to come.  </p>
