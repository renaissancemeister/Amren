<h1>Protester&rsquo;s Grant on the Line</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse James DeConto, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), May 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Student activist Haley Koch will meet with the head of the Morehead-Cain Foundation Monday to discuss the fate of her prestigious scholarship.</p>
<p>Neither Koch nor Morehead-Cain director Chuck Lovelace would say whether Koch has been temporarily denied access to some of her funding, but Lucy Hanes Chatham, chairwoman of the Morehead-Cain Board of Trustees, said that&rsquo;s likely.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s nothing more than standard procedure when one of our scholars has been arrested,&#8221; Chatham said.</p>
<p>Koch was charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct April 23, nine days after she and another young woman disrupted an event sponsored by the student group Youth for Western Civilization. They held up a 12-foot banner that read &#8220;No Dialogue with Hate&#8221; and forced YWC president Riley Matheson, a fellow senior, to move forward into the aisles to address the audience. YWC opposes &#8220;radical multiculturalism,&#8221; affirmative action and mass immigration.</p>
<p><b>Charges and hate mail</b></p>
<p>&#8220;The defendant held up a banner and refused to put it down, chanted and sang loudly whereby she did not allow the scheduled lecturer to speak at a school-group-sponsored event,&#8221; reads Koch&rsquo;s arrest warrant.</p>
<p>The event ended when a protester broke a window and Tom Tancredo, a former Colorado congressman, fled the building. Among hundreds who protested, dozens who pushed their way into a Bingham Hall corridor, several who shouted at the YWC speakers and four who held up banners in front of them, Koch was the only person charged with a crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Koch said she&rsquo;s received hate mail, but, so far, the criminal charge and the jeopardy of her scholarship are the only concrete repercussions of her activism. She declined to comment in detail on either one.</p>
<p>Funded by a private foundation, Morehead-Cain is the most competitive scholarship in the UNC system. It pays for full four-year tuition, fees, housing, meals, books, supplies and travel. It also covers four summer-enrichment programs starting before freshman year. For an out-of-state student such as Koch, the scholarship is worth about $140,000. John Motley Morehead III established the foundation in 1945 and started the scholarship program in 1951. In 2007, Gordon Cain donated $100 million to expand the program.</p>
<p><b>Exceptional background</b></p>
<p>Koch is a product of Sidwell Friends, the Quaker school attended by President Barack Obama&rsquo;s daughters Sasha and Malia and former presidential daughter Chelsea Clinton. Koch, of Cabin John, Md., was among 43 freshmen who received the Morehead scholarship in 2005.</p>
<p>Her parents are Susan and Christopher Koch, Emmy and Peabody award-winning filmmakers. Four of their relatives were killed on American Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001. A year later, Susan Koch produced an ABC/Nightline special on how families were honoring those who died in the terror attacks.</p>
<p>On the day of her arrest, Haley Koch received the 2009 Undergraduate Excellence Award from the APPLES Service-Learning program for her work organizing United with the Northside Community Now. UNC-NOW works to preserve the identity of the historically black neighborhood north of downtown Chapel Hill. The group also received the 2009 Engaged Scholarship Award from the Carolina Center for Public Service for their work collecting oral histories from the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Most recently, UNC-NOW has made demands on the developers of Greenbridge, a 10-story, eco-designed condo complex under construction at the edge of the neighborhood, saying they should work with the town to provide more benefits such as affordable housing, jobs, training and tax relief to long-time residents.</p>

			<p>So many of her relatives were killed in the 9/11 attacks, yet she hasn&rsquo;t learned anything from it.</p>
<p>It is extremely difficult for non-NC residents (other than illegal aliens) to get into UNC.  Was Miss Koch that good, or was there some legacy involvement?  </p>
<p>I predict she&rsquo;ll keep her scholarship.  Her benefactors agree with that kind of behavior.</p>

<p>Haley Koch is a self-hating leftist.  She even dressed up as an African (completely top-less!) and danced with African tribesmen!  Visit the above link to see for yourself.</p>

			<p>Ms. Koch is a smart, attractive white woman. She SHOULD be on our side. Maybe an encounter with the real face of crime in America will scare her away from the multi-cult. Lets hope she spends a few months in lockup with objects of her affection. This outcome was most likely caused by the agitprop indoctrination she received at Sidwell.</p>

			<p>Sidwell Friends. Filmmaker parents. Pampered, privileged liberal elite going through her campus radical phase. How precious!</p>
<p>Seriously, four of her relatives were killed in a terrorist attack and she only has words for anti-illegal immigrant patriots. I wonder if she ever even pondered protesting radical Islam. What a disgrace. </p>

			<p>What a shame that such a good looking and smart young woman is devoting her energies to undermine the Constitution of the United States. Truly a shame in every way. </p>
<p>This is what happens when two generations of our American best and brightest get a free ride through life with no first hand experience of struggle and no taste of what freedom really means. </p>

			<p>Four of her relatives were murdered by muslim terrorists on flight 77 and she still can&rsquo;t understand why political correctness and multicult is a death wish?  Like most insane liberals, she sees anyone that opposes the cult of PC and minority coddling as her true enemy.  Those that murdered her relatives, well they were just &#8220;acting out&#8221; because of the oppression of western civilization.  I would love to see an enemy of the constitution like this airhead be shunned and punished for her stupidity but I don&rsquo;t hold out much hope of that happening at the university of liberal non-thought.   </p>

Although there will be questions, they won&rsquo;t touch her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a liberal working for the betterment of humanity so she&rsquo;s immune to sanctions.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll beat the rap and become a hit on the anti-hate lecture circuit.</p>

			<p>Hopefully she gets kicked out of that school permanently. They need to follow through on the intolerance isseu. No disruption of people practicing free speech ought to be allowed on campus. Picket outside the hall and if you don&rsquo;t like what they say inside, stay out.</p>

			<p>Unbelievable.  Although four members of this girl&rsquo;s family were killed on 9/11, she has devoted her life to expanding the very cult of diversity and multiculturalism which made 9/11 possible.  Does she have no shame?  The effects of liberal brainwashing are strong indeed.</p>

			<p>A &#8220;scholar&#8221;&hellip;right.This is what constitutes an intellectual? Narcissistic buffoon, I&rsquo;d say. And probably not all that bright either. <br/>
The funny part of this is that one gets to take a look at the social background of violent college-age protestors, at least in this country. Are these people a send up or what? Why should this spoiled brat be given money for college? You could find thousands of hard working - and brighter - students who could make a difference because they wouldn&rsquo;t be wasting their time demonstrating, they&rsquo;d be studying a subject that would be relevant in the 21st century. Of course that implies this goof could handle science at the college level. <br/>
 I guess if you can&rsquo;t really do academically rigorous work at least you can impress the black folks and get by that way.<br/>
Bet ya she&rsquo;d fail a tough algebra class.</p>

<p>What a piece of work this Comrade Haley is!</p>
<p>She and her Communist cronies go on a rampage of anti-white hate and she has the gall to whine about any of these sanctions, or the so-called &ldquo;hate mail&rdquo; she is getting? I suppose she thinks she should be getting love letters and a free ride to graduate school instead?</p>
<p>Young Pioneers like Comrade Haley, are some of the most mindlessly vicious creatures to ever walk this planet; they have but one goal, the total genocide of the white race. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by her smiling cherub-like countenance in that photo, for it masks a soul as black as the average ghetto dwellers or gang bangers, that she most likely regularly frolics and fornicates with, as a display of her &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; for the whole world to witness.</p>
<p>It is a rare justice, that sees the fecklessly wretched Comrade Haley getting even as little of her deserved consequences, as she has. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br/>

Everyone please go to the link AmRen provided for photos of Koch &#8220;going native&#8221; in Africa (nudity alert!). </p>
<p>What this young white woman did during Mr. Tancredo&rsquo;s speech was bad enough; the pix of her attempting to reverse thousands of years of white evolution   &mdash;   by regressing to a dredlocked sub-Saharan tribeswoman baking away under the African sun   &mdash;   are worse. This deliberate devolution is a disturbing new form of postracial insanity that I&rsquo;ve never seen before   &mdash;   and I thought I&rsquo;d seen it all. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly shocking that we have among us young white people with not only no allegiance to their own blood, but an outright HOSTILITY to it! </p>
<p>I have seen the enemy, and she is Haley Koch. </p>

			<p>I can remember watching a movie about Patty Hearst and her SLA kidnappers. One of the kidnappers who was white had covered his face with black shoe polish. He was standing in front of a mirror acting like he was black taunting white people. Later in the movie he has an argument with other SLA members and then confesses in anger that he wishes that he was black. It was hilarious. When I see pictures of Haley from her trip to Africa I see the same hilarious mentality.</p>

			<p>Oh how nice, she works to preserve a &#8220;historically&#8221; black neighborhood. If she&rsquo;s so concerned, why doesn&rsquo;t she live in that neighborhood? She should also insist that her parents move there too. That way they could have a more &#8216;hands on&rsquo; experience. Why doesn&rsquo;t she work to preserve a historically WHITE neighborhood? Most of these places have only been &#8220;historically&#8221;  black for the last 30-50 yrs. and were originally built and maintained by our WHITE forefathers. I&rsquo;m sure the &#8220;oral histories&#8221; this little liberal will collect will be from some &#8216;old school&rsquo; thug about how they &#8220;ran those racissss White folks out the hood.&#8221; I sure all of you have had the privilege of driving thru such neighborhoods and, like me, have been heartbroken at the sight of stately victorian homes surrounded by trash and weeds that are boarded up/gutted. Is THAT the &#8220;identity&#8221; she wants to preserve? I&rsquo;m sure that one of these days one of these &#8220;historically&#8221; black neiborhoods will present her with an &#8216;Any biel?&rsquo; award.</p>

UNC-NOW works to preserve the identity of the historically black neighborhood north of downtown Chapel Hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Works to preserve the identity of the historically black Chapel Hill??? Does this mean she works to keep a black neighborhood black? Wouldnt his be called racism if she worked to keep a white neighborhood white?&hellip;.Apparently she doesnt feel the same about preserving the HISTORICALLY WHITE United States of America as she does about preserving Chapel Hill for blacks. </p>
<p>Perhaps an appropriate punishment can be handed down where this progressive American can retain her scholarship. Since she is concerned with maintaining the integrity of historically black neighborhoods, perhaps she could perform community service in the Chapel Hill area. Maybe even live there while doing such admirable work. Im sure this would be an eye opening experience for her. </p>

			<p>Think if this had been a porn star she would have interfered with the exercise of their free speech?  Of course not.  But then, is Haley Koch Morehead Scholar material?  No, and probably never was.  </p>
<p>When the best UNC can produce is being arrested for interfering with the exercise of a citizen&rsquo;s Constitutional rights, what does that say about the state of higher education!</p>
<p>As a mother of two who graduated as deer-in-the-headlights liberals from a state university system, I would advise anyone who thinks they are sending off their children to receive an proper education, consider a religious or military academy.</p>

<p>Sidwell is a private school in our nation&rsquo;s capital where liberals send their kids to keep them out of the all-black D.C. public schools.</p>
<p>She goes to a white school in the midst of D.C. yet calls the great Tom Tancredo a bigot.</p>

			<p>      I went to HeidiKochGoesToAfrica-great stuff. I&rsquo;d like her<br/>
to come and stay with me and get straigtened out. But seriously,<br/>
as gifted as she may be, her people have never been good for Am-<br/>
erica. They don&rsquo;t consider themselves White or European and they<br/>
intend to bring us down. Genetically she is very close to us-but<br/>
in her mind and heart she is a million miles away. This is typ-<br/>
ical of her people-however close some of them are to us genet-<br/>
ically. It has been this way for thousands of years and it will<br/>
be this way for the forseeable future. </p>

			<p>i feel sorry for these mindles children, but the real culprit is the educational system and their insaitable desire to vilify whiteness for the last 40 years&hellip;they should be put out of business&hellip;after j edgar hoover died these instututions went rampant with unamerican thought and anti-white hatred. they are so hung up on race it permiates their every waking moment. these black studies courses have become hot beds of anti white thought.even harvard has on their payroll a person named noel ignatiev that teaches these vulnerable kids that whiteness should be eliminated. they need to bring criminal charges against these universities and shut them down. also there should be rules made where there is absolutely no politics allowed on college campusus. this is a time for learning for these kids not politics. the communists have taken over our universities. </p>

			<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just the pampered upbringing that made her like this. Sidwell Friends really is a mental institution for rich kids. The last time I drove by it there was a big sign that said &#8220;Save Darfur&#8221;, and smaller signs assaulting one&rsquo;s senses with other stupid slogans. I almost feel sorry for these young people, being literally driven insane by the asinine priorities of  thoughtless parents. And then I remember that they fully expect to rule the rest of us someday. Intellectually, they are no match for the home taught young folks who now number in the millions. But just don&rsquo;t expect the Haley Koches of the world to give up thier power over the rest of us without a fight. I hope everyone knows what that means.</p>

			<p>Typical of these left-wing activists that instead of organising their own meetings, they disrupt the legal meetings of others they do not agree with by shouting down the invited speakers.  It happens everywhere.  They then call the legal speakers &#8220;fascists&#8221; or similar names, not realisng that the fascists are the ones who disrupt the meetings, that is themselves, when they interupt qith the aim to stop democratic discussions with various points of view being aired. Instead of debating the subjects in a civilised manner, they try to stop anyone else listening.  </p>
<p>As a non-American citizen, I politely offer my opinion that she should lose her scholarship as punishment for not being a good citizen deserving of such privileges.</p>

			<p>The most frightening part is that there are tens and tens of thousands of young &#8220;Haley&rsquo;s&#8221; just like her. Most of the generation of young people from roughly 13 to 30 are hopelessly liberal in their views, raised and inculcated as much by MTV, Hollywood, TV, and a parade of liberal/leftist teachers, preachers and assorted personalities who all religeously toe the PC line, as any parent they might still have in their lives(remember, two parent families are so out of style these days). These kids don&rsquo;t have a chance&hellip;    </p>

After reaching no answers that satisfied me, I resigned my self to Ms. G. Steins philisophical observation, that &#8220;a rose is a rose is a rose.&#8221; Haley Koch is what she is. There is no need to comment at length about her, because she has made a very clear statement about herself. Enough said.</p>

			<p>Haley&rsquo;s dad, Christopher Koch, was famous for his TV documentary &#8220;Blacklist: Hollywood on Trial&#8221;. He got an Emmy award for it. </p>
<p>You all know the story: Evil White McCarthyite Christians refuse to give jobs to Communist writers, etc.  If you ask the Koches they will say the TV show was to advance the fight for freedom of speech and thought.  </p>
<p>The real purpose is to encourage a profound sense of white gentile guilt.  Of course Mr. Koch and his wife would deny it.  One would expect that.  </p>
<p>But their daughter gives it all away.  Brownshirt Haley has suckled at the Koch breast for 20 years.  She is a Koch.  She knows the real Koch message.  And it isn&rsquo;t free speech and free thought &hellip; at least not for us.</p>
<p>You see, to the Koches of this world we are evil haters.  Our beliefs, our religion, our desire to continue our own culture are fundamentally illegitimate. </p>
<p>We are hate incarnate and, as Haley learned from her parents Christopher Koch and Susan Koch, we cannot be permitted to organize or speak. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the Hollywood communists for which the Koches proselytized and got their Emmy award, are different than us, better than us. </p>
<p>The Koches do ot have anything against suppressing OUR speech.  They are only against the suppression of THEIR speech.  We must be enlightened.  They are the enlighteners.  As far as they are concerned, the world would be a better place without us.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve made it a point not to date women that liberal.  It&rsquo;s funny because they say they are so open-minded, yet they won&rsquo;t date a man who is conservative. Just more liberal hypocrisy and &#8220;compassion&#8221; I guess.</p>

			<p>No matter what this pretend lefty looks like, she does not consider herself White.  </p>
<p>She is one of a long line of radicals who use blacks as a battering ram against &#8216;oppressive&rsquo; Whites  &mdash;  all the while retreating to safe White areas to live, wrapping themselves in  First Amendment rights for themselves (this will be her defense, no matter how lame), utilizing and exploiting the tenants of Western Civilization for their own ends (while at the same time harshly criticizing that system which made her little protest possible).</p>
<p>Not to worry, when the demographics of this country finally tilt, something radicals of her ilk are hell-bent on bringing about, her little antics will elicit a knock on the door  &mdash;  or a knock on the head.</p>
<p>Wonder if she&rsquo;d try such activity in China or South Africa?  Maybe she should ask Amy Biehl  &mdash;  Oh, that&rsquo;s right! Amy lost her life trying to bring about &#8216;Social Justice&rsquo; for blacks in South Africa  &mdash;  looks like those blacks weren&rsquo;t much interested in Social Justice:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Amy Biehl was murdered by radical members of the militant Pan Africanist Congress in 1993 while working to help South African blacks and women vote in their election&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>From GetBackJack:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;She&rsquo;d be a very courteous, well-mannered, highly-knowledgeable young lady within seven short days. Blame her parents. I&rsquo;ll volunteer to straighten them out, too!&hellip;&#8221;</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s a perfect example of the kind of white that is so easily duped into a particular mindset she could be the poster girl for white naivete and gullibility.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s led a privileged life, without knowing of the harsher realities of anti-white hatred, and she feels morally superior and smug.</p>
<p>It is whites like these that are not only our greatest enemies, they are their own nemesis, because they can never be straightened out, unless they are face to face for quite a long time, learning up close and personal the reality of hate that confronts them because they&rsquo;re white.  At least a five year stint in a black urban setting would probably be necessary to shock her out of her cult-like mindset.</p>
<p>To understand how she was molded the way she is, it&rsquo;s only necessary to study the progression of fanaticism within Mao&rsquo;s Red Guard, and Stalin&rsquo;s mind control subjects and others like them throughout history.</p>
<p>The radical left are masters of propaganda and deception, but this type of programmed advocate taxes not one iota of their abilities, because she is such an absolute fool she would likely get into a pervert&rsquo;s car if he offerred her a Rolaid.</p>

			<p>The little cutie pie exterior of Haley Koch doesn&rsquo;t fool me.  She has the mentality of a Joseph Stalin or a Karl Marx.  Any viewpoint that differs from her agenda needs to be shut down at any cost even if she lost her scholarship.  She says nothing about her relatives being murdered on 9/11 because obviously she is anti-American and most likely feels &#8220;they got what they deserved&#8221;.  She is anti-white as well wanting more than anything to be black as shown in her photos.  As far as I&rsquo;m concerned she should give up her scholarship and her American citizenship and go live in Africa where she can be free of &#8220;whitey&#8221; and free from that evil &#8220;America&#8221;.  Haley Koch is a traitor to her country and a traitor to her race and no doubt she is perfectly happy with that.  This disease called &#8220;liberalism&#8221; is destroying the minds of our youth at epidemic proportions and makes the &#8220;swine flu&#8221; look insignificant in comparison. <br/>

  I made the mistake of going to the Haley-Goes-to-Africa website.Those photos are comical if seen from a saturnine and jaundiced perspective. But, as a chivalrous man, I find them heart-breaking. I have no &#8220;new perspective&#8221; to add to the comments here. I do, however, have an old perspective  &mdash;  that is, the perspective of a caucasian person who,after reaching middle age, has concluded that our civilization came into being in order to make it possible for the best and the most beautiful to flourish and excel, the mediocre to be content, and the lowest to be kept under the benign control of their superiors. Here we have a beautiful and misguided young woman who is descended from a life of privilege that has been squandered in the lazy-minded affectations of self-infatuated &#8220;social conscience.&#8221; She is helplessly compelled to degrade herself on behalf of those who lack the capacity to even conceive of the civilizational qualities that raised her people to ascendancy. This is what Jacques Barzun meant when he reminded us that philanthropy is one of the enemies of intellect. The decadent and enfeebling dogma of egalitarianism has made a soft-headed barbarian out of her, and, sadly, there is no doubt that she will soon become a victim of her own, and her parents&rsquo;, misplaced charity.  <br/>

<p>I agree. In fact, this silly young girl can hardly be blamed for her foolishness.  Unlike most of us, she did not come to her views on her own.  She was raised in this atmosphere.  It&rsquo;s all she ever knew.  In her home and in her school/s she has been surrounded by this  exclusively far-leftist point of view that blacks are wonderful and superior and that we have so much to learn from them. And, of course, we owe them so much in return for all the harm we&rsquo;ve done.   Meanwhile, she&rsquo;s been kept sheltered far from the realities of urban blacks in the USA. And if it&rsquo;s acknowledged that they indeed have any pathologies, whether here or elsewhere, that&rsquo;s all considered  the fault of the wicked whites who have exploited and oppressed these poor, wonderful nature people. </p>
<p>What else would this foolish girl know in her few short years of life? It&rsquo;s all straight out of the sociology textbook or from her parents documentaries.  As we see, her ears have been closed by Marxist propaganda to any other point of view except the &#8220;correct&#8221; one.  And, good Bolshevik  that she is, she&rsquo;s determined not to let anyone else hear any other point of view that might corupt them. </p>
<p>Fussy old-fashioned notions about Freedom of Speech and constitutional rights are passé in her progressive 21st century, the outdated creations of old dead white male slaveowners concerned with preserving White Privilege.  <i>All that must go! </i>[By the way, ominously, that was the name of a bloodthirsty song sung by the Parisian mobs in the French Revolution: &ldquo;Tout Ça Ira&rdquo;.]   Coincidence?  It&rsquo;s history déjà vu.  Reigns of Terror happen when fatuous idealists like her   &mdash;   who know better than you do what&rsquo;s good for you   &mdash;   get the power to reshape your lives and are determined either to reform you or kill you trying.  Goodbye Constitution!  Hello chaos!</p>
<p>A mulatto president has been the first step in that direction.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s another black on white multiple murder.  Recently in Hoffman Estates, a suburb of Chicago, a 20 year old black male butchered a white family.  They were the family of the white mother of his child.  He murdered them with a butcher knife. He killed his &#8220;baby mama&rsquo;s&#8221; sister, father and grandmother.  He badly injured her mother.  He had a history of sexual assault.</p>

			<p>When I made my comments last night that Comrade Haley most likely, &ldquo;regularly frolics and fornicates&rdquo; with &ldquo;African-American&rdquo; transplants, they were made with a high degree of speculation, perhaps even a bit recklessly so. However, viewing those photos provided by: Posted by Haley Koch Goes to Africa at 6:19 PM on May 4, clearly show that I was far too kind in my assumptions about the proclivities of this godless little Red harlot.</p>
<p>To say that I am both nauseously amused and distinctly appalled would be understatements, to be sure!</p>
<p>Just when you think that the worthless Red idiots in this country couldn&rsquo;t possibly sink any lower, they do their very best and prove you wrong and in spades!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

			<p>To Black Emperor, regarding: </p>
<p>1.) &ldquo;Who said she is white?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not I Comrade, she is as Red as a rotting tomato in the August sun at high noon in my book!</p>
<p>2.) &ldquo;She embraces humanity. Also, I doubt she&rsquo;ll lose her scholarship. In fact, her activism demonstrates a conscientiousness that goes outside of the traditional rubric, a welcome asset to any institution of higher learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How do you know she &ldquo;embraces humanity;&rdquo; have you spoken with her personally? How do you define her &ldquo;humanity?&rdquo; Is it the fact that she &ldquo;rejects&rdquo; her whiteness at moments of rapturous Marxist frenzy; or is it the fact that she is willing to frolic with Africans for photo opportunities, worthy of the pages of Hustler?  Come on your &ldquo;highness,&rdquo; throw us with your insights into how she would be &ldquo;a welcome asset to any institution of higher learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.) &ldquo;Is it me or have you noticed that most individuals who have high IQs tend to be Liberal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>How do you know what her IQ is your &ldquo;highness?&rdquo; It isn&rsquo;t mentioned in the article at all. Were you given a copy of an intelligence test that she has taken? Also, it is funny that most Liberals are only portrayed as &ldquo;intelligent,&rdquo; when they have willing accomplices to &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; or &ldquo;edit&rdquo; a forum in which they spew their dogma. Get them in a one on one, no holds barred situation, and they quickly dissolve into spasmodic profanity and frantically clichéd vitriol. Now why might that be?</p>
<p>I await your response, with almost unendurable anticipation!</p>
<p>Take your time Black Emperor, I know that you are very busy helping to build the Ugandan space program with Comrade Haley at the moment,</p>
<p>John PM!  </p>

			<p>Many young whites (and some old ones too  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ve succumbed myself in some ways) don&rsquo;t do well when exposed to the strong life energies of some third world peoples.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the solution is, but it probably has to be considerably more sophisticated than focusing ONLY on the other important inducement to such behavior, whites&rsquo; conditioning to hate their own race and culture.</p>
<p>There has to be some sort of acknowledgment of the genuine grounds for the attraction many young whites feel toward third worlders.</p>
<p>Whites&rsquo; bedazzlement by third worlders&rsquo; more emotional way of living is part of the reason they are so easily led to hate their own race and culture.</p>

<p><br/>
That &#8220;more emotional way of living&#8221; is also a more dangerous way of living,inevitably producing the usual riots, revolutions, strong-arm dictators, personality cults, famines, coups,  etc.   </p>
<p>Our own, calmer, sober, &#8220;more rational way of living&#8221; has produced the advancements of Western Civilization as we know it today. It took us a long time to get here, but I wouldn&rsquo;t give it up for some frenzied singing and dancing that makes you feel good for the moment, that is before AIDS sets in or the latest famine or tribal war. </p>

<p>This is a good example of how those richly endowed foundations have been taken over and  perverted from their original intentions.   I&rsquo;m sure the philanthropists who set up those foundations had no idea how their money would someday be misused and misspent, or they would never have donated a penny.</p>

<p>Most blacks claim to be liberal and they have average IQs of 85 (70 in sub-Saharan Africa).</p>
<p>But then again, blacks have a much greater sense of race consciousness than whites. For them, justice is what is good for their own people. Whites should indeed copy this racialism from blacks.</p>

			<p>Harumphty Dumpty is on to something.  Many White youth quite rightly want something more out of life than suburban living with every imaginable electronic toy.  The word &#8220;vibrant&#8221; draws a lot of sneers on this site, but it&rsquo;s more than just a euphemism for gang violence.  To walk down a street and see familiar faces, to exchange greetings or stop and talk, is what living in a town is about.  That&rsquo;s why kids flock to the malls.  Kids also want adventure, more adventure than can be had while wearing safety helmets and knee pads.  I remember sneaking out at night to skulk about in the dark, engaging in petty hooliganism, throwing eggs at houses and the like.  Smoking dope at 16 was a thrill I gave up only  when I started riding motorcycles.  I wasn&rsquo;t bad, just bored.  <br/>
     The comfortable life we offer youth, the easy sex and drugs, the absence of real labor and the respect it earns them, and the 24/7 entertainment, does not engage the best of them.  Our enemies tell them that Blacks and other non-Whites have some undefinable essence, some special access to a full emotional life, and they  go looking for it.  Posters on this site object to the phrase &#8220;White bread culture&#8221;, but it&rsquo;s not entirely a slander.  Our culture has been stripped of much of its meaning, displaced by Hollywood/New York controlled amusements.  We will not wean our youth of multi-culturalism if we cannot offer them our own vibrant culture.  </p>

<p>Excellent point, Mr. Dumpty!   <br/>
You might also  mention  ticks, fleas, lice, bedbugs, Guinea worms,  hookworms, cockroaches all over the dung hut, plus spiders, clouds of  flies everywhere, snakes occasionally wandering in, abusive treatment from the men - and from the older women - as well as having to do all of the heavy work &hellip;.   and then, as icing on the cake, having her genitals excised with a rusty old  razor or pair of scissors.   Sounds like fun, eh?

Why are those same Africans so desperate to get away from all that and into Europe that they&rsquo;ll risk drowning in an overcrowded  little rowboat or raft?</p>

			<p>&#8220;The real question here is, what is such a priveleged white champion of the left doing using up a valuable scholarship place that could have been awarded to a more deserving minority?&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by Anonymous at 9:22 PM on May 4 </p>
<p>I think I have the answer; Being a woman, she is in a protected group. White women have benefited tremendously from the Protected Groups laws and this is a good example of how good looks and the right gender has so often gained priviliged programs and career outcomes.  I note all the good looking White female reporters and newscasters only increasing lately - along with Obama look alike &#8220;oppressed&#8221; males.</p>

<p>Students file formal complaint against DPS</p>
<p>&#8220;A group of students, faculty and community members have filed a formal complaint against the Department of Public Safety for police use of force at the April 14 protest of former U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo&rsquo;s speech and into the arrest of student Haley Koch nine days after the event.&#8221;</p>
<p>An excerpt from the whiny proclamation:</p>
<p>FORMAL COMPLAINT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY</p>
<p>We, the undersigned, establish a formal complaint with the Department of Public Safety concerning campus police use of excessive force, intimidation and harassment of students and community members on the night of April 14th and in subsequent weeks.  We believe that the actions of the campus police have been unwarranted, unnecessary and politically motivated with the intent of spreading a chill across campus to silence free speech and expression.  These actions should be fully investigated and appropriate actions should be taken against the police officers involved.  </p>
<p>Our complaint is substantiated on the following incidents:</p>
<p>Throwing a student to the ground:</p>
<p>A student was asked to leave the auditorium, and although she was cooperating fully with Lt. Twiddy and walked out of the room, Lt. Twiddy threw her to the floor.  She was thrown so forcefully that she slid across the hallway into a wall.  She was bruised for several days as a result of the excessive force used by Lt. Twiddy.</p>
<p>Pulling the hair of a student:</p>
<p>As officers were pushing and shoving students out of the hallway, one officer grabbed a woman by her hair to forcibly remove her, as she was attempting to exit the building.</p>
<p>Pepper spraying 8-10 students directly in the face:</p>
<p>Without delivering any verbal warning, several police officers began to release pepper spray.  They sprayed 8-10 students directly in the face, even though police reported to the media that the pepper spray was simply &ldquo;broadcasted&rdquo;.  Because the space was small and enclosed, even students who were not directly sprayed by police officers got particles in their eyes, noses and mouths, causing them to cough, gag and experience other adverse effects.  Passersby also were sprayed and affected.  Because of the small space, students could not escape the pepper spray despite trying.  Several students were in severe pain and had to be attended to by medics to rinse out their eyes, noses and mouths, even though police reports to media stated that no students were. </p>
<p>&ldquo;During the protest, I watched as some of my students were roughly pushed to the ground by police officers, sprayed with pepper spray, and threatened with a taser. I helped some students to the bathroom on the second floor of Bingham Hall to rinse the spray from their noses, mouths, and eyes,&rdquo; said Billie Murray, a Teaching Fellow and witness to the events.</p>
<p>Officers brandishing and threatening students with tasers:</p>
<p>Again without delivering a verbal warning, officers sparked their tasers to threaten students and chased them out of the hall.  These actions were taken even though students were already attempting to leave and caused further chaos and confusion.  Because of the large amount of people in a small enclosed space, using deadly weapons (tasers have killed over 150 people in the U.S. since 2001) was an extremely risky action as police easily could have harmed a student even by accident.  </p>
<p>Intimidation of a student:</p>
<p>On Tuesday, April 21st, Lt. Twiddy and another police officer came to a classroom where the primary contact of Students for a Democratic Society, UNC student Hannah Simmons, was in attendance. They then accused her of lying about her whereabouts during the Tancredo demonstration and erroneously claimed they had footage of her there.  The officers came and disrupted her during class even though she had already told them on the phone that she was not in attendance at the protest. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I had already told the police when they called me on the phone that I was not at the demonstration and was not involved in the organization of the protest. I also told them I would not speak to them without a lawyer present. But they cornered me outside of my class on Tuesday and tried to get me to answer their questions without my lawyer. Their behavior was very aggressive and confrontational, and I was nervous about coming to class today after being harassed in this way.  It was very shocking to me that they would come to my class as I was trying to finish my last week at school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arrests of six community members at the Virgil Goode speech:</p>
<p>On Wednesday, April 22, UNC Police arrested six people for allegedly speaking during a talk by Virgil Goode in the Union Auditorium. Many other people in the audience also vocally protested the content of Goode&rsquo;s speech, but the police targeted specific individuals for arrest and banned the protesters from campus for two years.  It should also be noted that since the six community members did not struggle when confronted by the police, escorting them out of the auditorium would have been sufficient; to arrest them was an excessive measure.</p>
<p>Arrest of a single student activist for attending the Tancredo speech:</p>
<p>Although media reports suggest that over 100 people were in attendance at the Tancredo protest, campus police have targeted a single student for arrest.  Morehead Scholar and Honors student Haley Koch was arrested for disrupting an educational event, &ldquo;holding a banner, chanting and singing loudly.&rdquo;  She was confronted by a police officer outside her class, handcuffed and led across campus.  </p>
<p>&ldquo;Another student and I were having a conversation after class with Haley just before she was arrested outside the Fred Brooks building. As soon as we walked away, a police officer who had been lurking near us approached and placed her under arrest. She was handcuffed and forced to stand there for several minutes before being walked away,&rdquo; said classmate Fola Goke-Pariola.</p>
<p>When Haley demanded to know why she was being arrested, the officer refused to inform her.  She was humiliated; forced to stand in front of her class in handcuffs for several minutes before being taken away for questioning.  This public handcuffing and arrest of a student 9 days after the event, while she was peacefully standing outside of class, was an unjustified show of force designed to intimidate other students.    No attempt was made to contact her and request that she appear at the police station to have the warrant served.   Instead, she was visibly and publicly humiliated to set an example that is designed to chill the speech and political activity of other students.  </p>
<p>Selective prosecution:</p>
<p>Although a window was broken at the Trancredo protests and there were attempts to disrupt Virgil Goode&rsquo;s lecture, there have been several other, more serious disruptive events that produced significant property damage and endangerment of student life. The NCAA Championship rush to Franklin St sent ten people to UNC hospitals and there were also reports of sexual harassment and vandalism.  Damages were estimated at over $100,000. Although two people were arrested after the NCAA championship, this token response does not compare to the police suppression after the Tancredo and Goode protests.  </p>
<p> A recent flash rave in Davis Library on UNC campus brought 3,000 students swarming into the library lobby, playing loud music, and disrupting students who were studying for exams.  Boisterous behavior resulted in a computer and a desk being damaged.  Campus police stood by and watched, and did not attempt to dispel the crowd for disrupting other students&rsquo; studies, or to take recourse for the damage done to university property.  It is clear that campus police are selectively targeting student activists, while allowing actual destructive student behavior to go by the wayside without investigation.  </p>
<p>False information:</p>
<p>Police reports to the media contained two statements that were patently false.  First, police stated that pepper spray was broadcast as a communication device.  In reality, campus police sprayed pepper spray directly into the faces of 8-10 students.  Second, police stated that no students were attended to by medics.  In reality, several students were so adversely affected by the pepper spray that a medic had to assist them in rinsing out their eyes, noses and mouths.  This falsification of information by the campus police is an attempt to mislead the public about the level of violence they used against students.  </p>
<p>Summary of police activity inconsistent with arrest:</p>
<p>The DPS website maintains a log of daily police activity.  On April 14th, the day of the Tancredo protest, all that was recorded was the broken window.  There is no record of disrupting an event or disorderly conduct.</p>

			<p>From Ranger:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;At least a five year stint in a black urban setting would probably be necessary to shock her out of her cult-like mindset&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Three weeks in Teach For America should do the trick.  </p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t imagine how these starry-eyed fools start off in September full of themselves, replete with tired old lefty canards, sure that they&rsquo;re going to show the gnarly old hands (who they believe to be oppressive White racists) like myself what we&rsquo;re doing wrong.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sure inner-city students will accept them fully as &#8216;one of their own&rsquo; as they prove they&rsquo;re &#8216;down with the cause&rsquo; of righteous indignation over a stifling, White-run system whose main purpose is to keep non-Whites down in the ghetto, poor and/or in prison for life in order to increase White power.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen one last past Christmas.</p>
<p>One sat at my table at a teachers&rsquo; meeting in October, about three weeks into the school year, a very young red-headed kid out of Harvard.  He looked so beaten down and destroyed that he could do nothing but stare at the table for the entire day.  I tried to talk to him but he wouldn&rsquo;t even look at me or answer my questions except to say he came from Harvard.  I imagine all his dreams of being a hero and savior were shattered during those three weeks in an inner-city school and all the dis-information he read about in &#8216;Pegagogy of the Oppressed&rsquo; or in Ayers&rsquo; books, and told in his training sessions were lies and damned lies.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t at the next meeting two weeks later.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;To understand how she was molded the way she is, it&rsquo;s only necessary to study the progression of fanaticism within Mao&rsquo;s Red Guard, and Stalin&rsquo;s mind control subjects and others like them throughout history&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Same tactics are employed today on our little children in the government-educational brainwashing system.  By the time they&rsquo;re college-age, the frontal lobes of their brains have been altered.  Remember the communist tenant &#8216;To Change Human Nature!&rsquo;     It&rsquo;s working  &mdash;  how else could a non-White radical be elected to the presidency?</p>
<p>The communists have done this by flooding our senses repeatedly and non-stop with messages that the perverse is normal and normal is abhorrent.  For example, notice all the TV shows, especially advertising, that depict White males as foolish, stupid, bumbling, no-nothing idiots until either a woman, little children or a non-White comes to his rescue.  </p>
<p>To object to this perversity is to have one&rsquo;s self branded as mentally ill, or soon, be brought into a show trial on charges of hate speech.</p>
<p>As to the origins of how this monster was unleashed into the US, WMD has this excellent article from William Lind entitled &#8220;Who Stole our Culture?&#8221;:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=55833" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=55833</a>  </p>
<p>And from Schoolteacher:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Many White youth quite rightly want something more out of life than suburban living with every imaginable electronic toy&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;ve extended childhood for them until age 23 or longer and childhood toys get boring.  In past generations, these &#8216;kids&rsquo; would have been hard at work at age 14 or younger.</p>

			<p>Haley Koch is more stunning proof of just how toxicly leftist the faculties in American universities have become, and the kind of ideologically brainwashed products they turn loose in society these days. </p>
<p>This girl has been absolutely wiped clean of any clue to the value and traditions of her own country, or any sense of urgency in protecting it, and instead has been trained to attack anyone possessing those loyalties - and equating THAT with moral courage, no doubt just the kind that will make mommy and daddy proud.</p>
<p>Of course she should lose her scholarship - her parents, being successful national media types can pick up the funding for her path toward eventually becoming America&rsquo;s version of England&rsquo;s grotesque Jacqui Smith.  </p>
