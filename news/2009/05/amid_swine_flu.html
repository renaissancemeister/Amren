<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30467300/">Amid Swine Flu Outbreak, Racism Goes Viral</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Alexander, MSNBC, May 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;No contact anywhere with an illegal alien!&#8221; conservative talk show host Michael Savage advised his U.S. listeners this week on how to avoid the swine flu. &#8220;And that starts in the restaurants&#8221; where he said, you &#8220;don&rsquo;t know if they wipe their behinds with their hands!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Thursday, Boston talk radio host Jay Severin was suspended after calling Mexican immigrants &#8220;criminalians&#8221; during a discussion of swine flu and saying that emergency rooms had become &#8220;essentially condos for Mexicans.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There is even talk of conspiracy. Savage speculated that terrorists are using Mexican immigrants as walking germ warfare weapons. &#8220;It would be easy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to bring an altered virus into Mexico, put it in the general population, and have them march across the border.&#8221;</p>
<p>As more than 140 cases of H1N1 virus, known as swine flu, have been confirmed across the United States  &mdash;  from San Diego to New York City  &mdash;  the growing public health concern has also exposed fear and hate.</p>
<p>Fear and blame are counterproductive and even dangerous in any disease outbreak because the more stigmatized any group feels, the more reluctant people in that group may be to seek medical care. That only helps propagate the disease.</p>
<p>The attempt to scapegoat Mexicans, immigrants and Hispanic Americans is no surprise to Latino rights groups, who are now mobilizing a countereffort.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Ignorant beyond the pale&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, called such comments &#8220;racist and ignorant beyond the pale .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. these so-called commentators shame themselves turning public health concerns into an immigrant bashing fest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we have seen is that the anti-immigrant groups are using this to shamelessly to promote their agenda,&#8221; said Liany Arroyo, director of the Institute for Hispanic Health at the National Council of La Raza.</p>
<p>While the war of words is mainly between the conservative commentariat and Latino advocacy groups, individual Mexican-Americas are beginning to worry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As swine flu fears have spread, the backlash has also affected some Mexican restaurants&rsquo; business, possibly fueled by disparaging comments like those of Savage questioning the hygiene of workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Blaming &#8216;the other&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Fearmongering and blame are almost a natural part of infectious disease epidemics, experts say.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a pattern we see again and again,&#8221; said Amy Fairchild, chair of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University&rsquo;s Mailman School of Public Health in New York City. &#8220;It&rsquo;s &#8216;the other,&rsquo; the group not seen as part of the nation, the one who threatens it in some way that gets blamed for the disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Americans have time and again responded to emergencies by clamoring to shut the borders and pull up the bridges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Fighting racism with information</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tamping down blame and fear isn&rsquo;t just the right thing to do morally, experts agree, it&rsquo;s also the right thing to do medically. Germs, Markel stressed, don&rsquo;t care about skin color or national origins or borders.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are naturally occurring events,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We expect flu pandemics every 30 to 40 years. It&rsquo;s the cost of living in a world of emerging infectious diseases. That&rsquo;s the folly of prejudice. They are wherever humans are.&#8221;<br>

			<p>Naturally occurring events?  What are the odds that a &#8220;naturally occurring event&#8221; would only occur among Mexicans and others who visited Mexico?   Cluster, not coincidence, por favor.</p>
<p>Michael Savage actually has an advanced degree in the relevant subject matter.  Most of the rest of the people are political hacks.  Guess who I would pay attention to first.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not beyond the pale that AQ is behind all of this.  We know that the H1N1 was never in pigs, that it is a hybrid of two different pig virii found in pigs on the opposite sides of the world.  Now who would have the ability and motive to fuse these two strains?  AQ&rsquo;s not stupid, they know that spreading flu in Mexico is tantamount to spreading it in the U.S., with our virtually open border.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We are supposed to pretend flu did not come from Mexico&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, at least the statements of the Mexican sycophants in the article are consistent with those of the governments. Afterall, we are also supposed to pretend that 20-30 million illegal alien Mexicans aren&rsquo;t living, working and committing every type of crime among us.</p>

<p>So now public health institutions are being according to the claptrap of postmodern literary theory. That gives me confidence.</p>

<p>Actually they do. That is one reason why Asians were hit by SARS much worse than anyone else. </p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;These are naturally occurring events,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We expect flu pandemics every 30 to 40 years. It&rsquo;s the cost of living in a world of emerging infectious diseases. That&rsquo;s the folly of prejudice. They are wherever humans are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No. These are naturally occurring events facilitated by open access between a developed nation with hygienic standards that took more than a century to get in place (the USA) and a third world dump where the uber rich live in condos next to shanty towns with no plumbing (Mexico). </p>
<p>Mexicans have brought many new diseases to the US. This is just one of them. Including lots of tropical diseases that have no business being here. If there was no human traffic to and fro, there would be far fewer &#8220;emerging diseases&#8221; showing up in temperate climates like this. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Those Chinese are just like the Gringos!,&#8221; scared of being accused of racism!  They think that the Chinese care one jot about accusations of racism.  They think there has been some sort of similar civil rights movement in China for the last 40 years.  They think the Chinese need Mexican laborers and Mexican food.  Just like Mexico and just like Hispanics, they are obvious and think no one notices.</p>

			<p>Mexico has always been a filthy place.  I cannot understand why anyone would go there for a vacation.  I did once and although a doctor aware of public health hazards there, I was visited by Montezuma&rsquo;s Revenge all the same.  It doesn&rsquo;t surprise me at all that Mexico City is a hotbed for new virus productions.  In this respect, Mexico is the new Asia.</p>

			<p>Yes, it was reported on our televised news here too.<br>
That it is no longer Mexican Swine Flu but H1N1.<br>
Renamed in a US congressional meeting admid fears it may damage the pork industry (and the Mexican people industry too apparently).<br>
And they also stated that the previousily reported 179 (ish) deaths that have occured in Mexico due to the flu has been downgraded to 19.<br>
And it now looks like it originated in California.<br>
But yet every Internation country I&rsquo;ve heard of that has confirmed cases of the disease, all have either had citizens return from visiting Mexico or has had Mexican nations visit them.<br>
<br>
Three examples&hellip;..<br>
Canada<br>

Hong Kong<br>

<i>Officials cordoned off the hotel on Friday after it was discovered that a Mexican who had been staying there had tested positive for swine flu</i><br>
New Zealand<br>

<i>The group of Rangitoto College students whose trip to Mexico sparked the first swine flu tests in New Zealand</i> <br>
<br>
It gives me deva vu on the first couple of days of reporting we got from Katrina, before the &#8216;spin doctors&rsquo;(not the sort of Dr&rsquo;s we need right now) got their hands on the story.<br>

			<p>&ldquo;And that starts in the restaurants&rdquo; where he said, you &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know if they wipe their behinds with their hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I never go to Mexican restaurants.  One reason is political, I do not want to encourage them.  The other reason is that Mexicans are dirty people, with poor sanitation standards as a cultural in general.  Aside from that, the very clear distain that they hold Whites in makes me wonder if they don&rsquo;t often spit in the food they serve to Whites.  It&rsquo;s not as if this isn&rsquo;t happening at all.</p>

			<p>As usual in this supposedly &#8220;balanced&#8221; news piece, the concerns of the supposed extreme right wing are reduced to mere snippets, while those on the left get extended quotations. Then any pretense of balance is discarded at the end with posturing about what is morally &#8220;the right thing to do&#8221; and the ridiculous claim that ALL &#8220;experts&#8221; are of one opinion about how the virus is spread and what to do to prevent it. Finally we are lectured that any concern must be the result of &#8220;prejudice.&#8221; If it were only this one article it would be one thing, but this is the kind of &#8220;balance&#8221; the media has been dishing out for the past 40 years or more.</p>

			<p>Probably this virus is going to turn out to be the usual garden variety, however, if, as Savage suggested, the bug was a lethal one, Homeland Security failed miserably to contain it by not closing the border and screening everybody coming in, especially those who came from Mexico.</p>
<p>The Obama radicals didn&rsquo;t want the border closed for political reasons and because it would hurt the economy, and Obama&rsquo;s  assertion that closing the border wouldn&rsquo;t help, because the bug was already introduced here by a few people, shows his lack of intelligence better than anything he&rsquo;s uttered so far.  It&rsquo;s never too late to try to contain a highly infectuous disease.  Too bad his teleprompter can do his thinking for him, also.</p>
<p>If we ever do have a deadly, highly contagious illness spreading rapidly, we might as well prepare to do what we can for ouselves, because this administration isn&rsquo;t going to lift a finger to protect its citizens, especially if it means slowing or setting back their agendas.</p>
<p>Tamiflu and antibiotics should be a part of everyone&rsquo;s preparedness stash.</p>

<p>I work in health care, and I&rsquo;ve been (pleasantly) surprised by co-workers&rsquo; awareness of why we&rsquo;re dealing with yet another pestilence brought to us over our open southern border.<br>

<p>But PLEASE DISREGARD the reality illegal immigration has re-introduced MANY diseases into our country that had virtually become extinct&hellip; Leprosy, tuberculosis, not to mention internal parasitic organisms.</p>
<p>Nor should you bother your head with the odds that that raggedy illegal immigrant trudging through the desert or wading the Rio Grande could very well be a carrier of yet another disease.</p>

			<p>As I have stated here many times over the past three years:the rage and anger towards post-1965 hispanics,asians,muslims and africans is right underneath the surface. 9/11 very briefly uncorked this anger and rage.</p>
<p>The immigration enthusiasts of the Republican and Democatic parties are playing with fire. Eventually there will be a several catastrophic events that will permanently uncorked the rage that is just below the surface in Native Born White America.</p>

			<p>The article starts out about disease and ends up being a misogynistic exorcise lambasting humanities shameful past. This is done by saying anyone who&rsquo;s scared of disease is ignorant and I would have to say evil.</p>
<p>The fighting against &#8216;ignorance&rsquo; ends up leading to an assault against reality. By the end it says we have nothing to fear from open borders, only the backlash of fear and ignorance, when in reality, only an isolated population would be safe from the transmission of disease. </p>

The top one has a sign that says &#8220;politicians&#8221; and the one UNDER it says &#8220;citizens&#8221;.  How perfect a statement is that?  Next time I go that way, I am taking my camera.</p>

			<p>One more time, boys and girls&hellip;.</p>
<p>Mexican is not a race. Mexican is a nationality.</p>
<p>While many Mexicans in the USA appear to be of American Indian origin, Mexicans come in all colors and races&hellip;..including white.</p>
<p>It is not racist to insist that the immigration laws of this country be enforced&hellip;..it is patriotic. </p>
<p>It is not racist to oppose the invasion of this country by foreign citizens (including Mexicans), who cross the border illegally. </p>
<p>It is not racist to resist the demands and claims of foreign citizens to several of the states of this Federal Union, for ultimate reunification with Mexico.<br>

			<p>It is a crime, bordering on treason, to allow sick and diseased persons to enter this country&hellip;..knowingly putting American citizens at risk. The fact that the disease has already crossed the border, does not mean that it does not matter any longer HOW MANY infected persons arrive in the future. </p>
<p>IT does not matter if the sick persons carry swine flu, e bola, hiv, or any other communicable diseases. Contaigon must be contained and the sick persons quarantined to protect the healthy populations.<br>

			<p>This whole swine flu scare is nothing but a WHO funding drive.  My guess is that this so-called pandemic will kill fewer than the common cold.</p>
<p>Just look at the total fatality rates of WHO&rsquo;s previous pandemic alarms.  This is just another group of self-serving criminal bureaucrats, who would, in a saner world, be put to death by slow fire.</p>

And this happened in Texas, of all places, where we know who makes up a huge part of the population. </p>
