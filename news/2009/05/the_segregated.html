<h1>The Segregated Greek System: Past, Present, Future</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brittney Knox, Changing Tides (University of Alabama), May 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It is the beginning of the fall semester and thousands of girls come to the University of Alabama weeks before the first day of school to participate in Rush.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As you look across the members&rsquo; faces you find that they are predominately white.</p>
<p>Similarly, as you look across the faces of a line that is seeking to pledge a historically black organization, you see little diversity.</p>
<p>Since the founding of Beta Lambda Kappa in 1973, the University of Alabama has found itself with two distinctly different Greek systems, one white and one black. The two have occasionally crossed to much attention and media frenzy, but on the whole the two remain separate. On a campus with an extremely active Greek community, it&rsquo;s no surprise that the segregated nature of the Greek system in many ways reflects the greater campus culture.</p>
<p>Attempts to Break Barriers</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Attempts to shatter racial barriers were not only individual but institutional. In 2001 the Faculty Senate passed a resolution before fall Rush in an attempts to integrate the fraternities and sororities. Some in the Senate even presented the idea of forcing white fraternities and sororities to move off campus, citing the fact that &#8220;discriminatory&#8221; organizations could not reside on the land of a publically funded school. Ultimately the proposition died at the hand of the board of trustees.</p>
<p>No similar resolutions have been put forward in the last eight years.</p>
<p>Gentry McCreary, director of Greek affairs, said that being a public institution the university has to give students the freedom of association. &#8220;We can&rsquo;t tell any organization who they can and cannot admit,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another alumnus of the University, who works in the community, said, &#8220;The reason why the Greek system is not integrated because it is all about who you are more comfortable with and things of that nature.&#8221; He added that it is the same concept of churches, which are also predominately one race as well.</p>
<p>In addition to some sororities making progress, the fraternities are as well.</p>
<p>Lambda Sigma Phi, a Christian based organization, admitted African American Calvin Johnson into their fraternity in 2001, the first white fraternity to do so.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Alpha Kappa Alpha was the first black sorority to move onto sorority row in 1986. Soon after someone burned a cross on the lawn, but those students were suspended.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Way Things Are</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many Greek students were unwilling to discuss racial issues because they said their sororities had banned them from discussing the issue with the media. The national arm of the National Panhellenic Conference also could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Recently, on a national level the NPC, which represents traditionally white sororities, has been promoting diversity through their Badge Day. During this event every woman wears her sorority&rsquo;s badge letters. The invitation was also sent to other organizations like the NPHC (the traditionally black sororities), NALFO (latino based organizations), NAPA (pacific islanders), and NMGC (Multicultural).</p>
<p>India Williams, an alumnae and formrer vice president of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically black sorority, said that education and continous dialougue among all organizations that fall under the Greek Life umbrella is key.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is also important to remember that Greek organizations are selective in nature and that aspect must be respected and embraced by both Greek and non-Greek individuals,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Currently, the amount of minority students that are applying to organizations that are predomintely one race are in small numbers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Different Approach: Multicultural Greeks</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With each incoming freshman class surpassing the last in enrollment numbers, the number of multicultural students has grown significantly. These students come from all different types of backgrounds. Around 17% of the University&rsquo;s students that fit into the minority category.</p>
<p>However, it has been a struggle for these multicultural students to fit into the Greek system as it is currently.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>President Alise Randolph, a junior majoring in studio art and geography, said, &#8220;Diversity in Greek Life is very important, because I feel that is what college should be about. It should be an experience of learning from people that are from different backgrounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It has been hard for the multicultural organizations to become as well accepted as other Greeks because they don&rsquo;t yet have the tradition and history. Sigma Lambda Gamma was founded in 1990, while Delta Xi Phi, another multicultural sorority, was founded in 1994 and has been on UA&rsquo;s campus since 2002.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reese [Tiffany Reese, a member of Delta Xi Phi] acknowledges that people in the Greek system may enjoy being with people with whom they have things in common. Yet she asked, &#8220;Who says that people in an organization like mine don&rsquo;t have anything in common with each other?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Recently, The University of Alabama added the United Greek Council (UGC) as a way for the multicultural organizations to have a governing body similar to the National Panhellenic Conference, the National Pan-Hellenic Council, and the Inter-Fraternity Council.</p>

<p>Except that they keep telling us that diversity is the most important thing of all.  Eventually, frats and sorors will be made to &#8220;integrate,&#8221; (i.e. white ones will be forced to accept blacks, certainly not the other way around).  What&rsquo;s bad for the goose of public facilities in Alabama in 1964 is also bad for the gander of U. of AL. frats and sorors in 2009.</p>

		<p>In California, most of the sororities are a blend of white, hispanic and asian girls.</p>
<p>One group of sororities however is racially discriminatory; I refer of course to the black sororities who are exclusively black. </p>

		<p>The only ones trying to &#8220;break barriers&#8221; are whites, and it never works. The first to self segregate in every campus are the ethnics themselves, starting with the blacks. Someone the melting pot has become the salad bowl, where apples and oranges are supposed to coexist forever without ever assimilating. </p>
<p>From the way things have gone in 400 years of American history, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that whites and blacks do not want to mix. <br>
Blacks want to keep their identity apart from us. They obviously do not want to mingle with us, because they set up all-black clubs for themselves the first chance they get. </p>
<p>We whites have bent over backward to accommodate them, and in return they tell us that it&rsquo;s &#8220;time for a change&#8221; because there won&rsquo;t be many &#8220;people who look like us&#8221; soon. Blacks should set up their own living space instead of trying to change our white society that we made for ourselves to suit their black way of life. </p>

		<p>When I was in college I looked at those houses just off the campus border, bedecked with Greek letters, and wondered, &#8220;Why not have fraternities with OTHER characters as well?&#8221;</p>
<p>What would happen if a bunch of college men or women decided to charter an assembly with some Cyrillic characters, or Viking runes?<br>
&#8220;You&rsquo;re from Sigma Chi Alpha? Pleased to meet you. I&rsquo;m from TIR-THORN-FEOGH.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What a joke. I love how the author makes sure to include the politically correct double-speak of &#8220;historically black sorority&#8221; when he mentions the uber-racist Alpha Kappa Alpha. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure AKA is working overtime to make sure there are plenty of young white women invited to rush next year&hellip;just like Bethel A.M.E. Church will soon be reaching out to invite more white families to worship with them.</p>

		<p>Having joined a fraternity in college I can say that it was one of the best decisions of my life.  I love my wife and kid but the times I had in the chapter were unforgettable.  One of the most important things we learned centered around unity.  The idea that what makes us the same is what makes us strong.  The idea that diversity is our strength certainly wasn&rsquo;t championed in our chapter and I don&rsquo;t know why anyone with half a brain would do so.  We had guys from different walks of life to be sure but we all came together and &#8216;unified&rsquo; under a common set of principles.  Those principles are still alive today.  Regrettably, my national fraternity like others runs around talking about the need for diversity.  &#8216;Who&rsquo; needs it?  I want my son to have the same opportunities I had and build friendships that last a lifetime - as mine have.  The blacks, the hispanics and the gays all have their own fraternities - good for them.  I liked my chapter being filled with guys like me, who looked like me, shared the same values and had similar backgrounds - like me.  The fraternity system, like the Western world, is becomining more and more feminized.  What a shame!  I wouldn&rsquo;t trade my experience for anything!  America needs men with guts, conviction, leadership and social skills.  Fraternities have been breeding grounds for these types of men over the last two centuries.  I hope that never changes but I fear that it will.  May the Greek system never die or wither on the vine - its far too valuable.</p>

		<p>I was in a fraternity at the University of Illinois. We had one black guy in my class when I was a pledge. At a football game, our fraternity had a whole section of seats, and he was sitting with us, one black face in a sea of white. I was sitting by the aisle when two black girls came up the steps. They were eyeing him with a cold hate. One girl said to the other, &#8220;What&rsquo;s he doing there with them?&#8221; They walked by slowly, looking daggers at him the whole time. I realized then it wasn&rsquo;t only white people who had problems with integration.</p>

		<p>In my experience, the only barriers that anyone wants to break down are the ones between White girls and black males! College and high school is probably the only chance they will get at White girls before most of them (the girls) learn about the black males and what can happen to them.</p>

<i>&#8220;What exactly is so wrong with people preferring their own kind?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s the most natural drive of all animals; to seek and bread with their own. That&rsquo;s why we have DIVERSITY. That&rsquo;s why we have cardinals, and finches, and jays, and penguins and not just one kind of all-purpose nondescript generic bird.</p>
<p>The only &#8216;problem&rsquo; here is political. Hence, anyone who follows their normal, natural, and healthy instincts is made to believe there&rsquo;s something mentally wrong with them.</p>
<p>The end result is that white women get raped by black men because white women are more afraid of being called racist than suffering physical violence.</p>

		<p>IMO, the &#8216;Greek system&rsquo; should be eliminated from the university structure altogether. Building community and developing a sense of belonging should take place in the lower grade levels, when young people are more spiritually malleable and capable of rapidly assimilating new attitudes. By the time you reach college level, you should be entirely focused on your chosen area of study, and you should be independent enough to pursue it solely through self-motivation and self-discipline. </p>
<p>Developing strong &#8216;bonds&rsquo; with fraternity or sorority friends is something that weakens the university experience, imo; films like &#8216;Animal House&rsquo; might stretch the reality of the situation a bit, but they still say something about the need to reform university education on a deeper structural level&hellip;</p>

		<p>I was in a fraternity in college and we were actually very diverse.  Most of the fraternities on campus had people from all racial groups.  The only exception were the black fraternities, who by definition, were all black.</p>
<p>If they want to integrate the Greek system, I suspect the strongest resistance will be from the black fraternities as all others have already been accepting members regardless of race for as long time.</p>

		<p>As a member of a traditional fraternity in the south I can say that this is not just limited to Alabama.  In fact, just about every respectable fraternity (respect within Greek Life) has no black members.  Just that same as Black fraternities do not have white members.  </p>
<p>What the article fails to recognize is the fact that a fraternity is not just a group of students on campus, but a large network that also includes past Alumni.  While the chapter is mainly a function of undergraduates, those students respect tradition and the importance of not upsetting alumni.  </p>
<p>On a different note, Hazing.  It was always amazing to me that certain black fraternities openly brand their members.  Just like cows&hellip; they heat steel over fire for a long period of time and press it against their member&rsquo;s bicep.  They then openly walk around with this mark that screams &#8220;I have been hazed&#8221; and nobody say&rsquo;s anything, not the administration, not the media.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, a white fraternity is caught at my university &#8220;egging&#8221; their pledges and gets put on probation.</p>
<p>Not that I have anything against the branding in black fraternities, it just always blew my mind how white fraternities get in trouble and criticized for much less.<br>

		<p>I was in a fraternity in college (just a couple of years ago) and there is no way my fraternity would have ever let a black member in, nor would any other respectable fraternity on campus.  Contrary to what some may think, young whites in the South are still very racially conscious.  Fraternities are about brotherhood.  Allowing blacks into a white fraternity (or allowing whites into a black fraternity) makes it impossible to have true brotherhood.  You have to be able to speak openly to your fellow fraternity brothers about anything - including race.  This simply cannot be done with a black person in the room.</p>

Doesn&rsquo;t anyone ever give any credit to the fact that blacks want freedom of association as well?<br>
Blacks do not necessarily want to live and breath whiteness(as the multicults assume) and so choose to join black fraternities.<br>
Why can&rsquo;t the multicults accept this?</p>

<p>You are probably the same person. The writing style is dramtiacally similar. </p>
<p>As someone who was a member of a fraternity in college from 1991-1995, I can attest to the fact that there were several fraternities on my campus that had Black members. These fraternities were respectable. There are amny Whites that we would not have let in as well.</p>
<p>It seems that you or both of you are the type of individuals that give the greek system the racist image that it is trying to get past. </p>

<p>Likewise. The same held true for my fraternity. I was in college from 2000-2005. There were a number of fraternities that had Black and Hispanic members. </p>
<p>In fact, my youngest brother who just graduated from Northewestern University last year told me that he had several Black and Hispanic brothers in his fraternity. This was supposedly one of the more desired fraternies to get into on campus.</p>
<p>In fact, from what I am hearing, I cannot speak for the University of Alabama, but it seems that a number of fraternities and sororites are becoming more racially integrated, slowly but surely.  </p>

<p>I think you are probably correct. I think that over the next decades and certainly next two decades, you will see the greek system become more racially diverse. The old alumni is getting older and will have less influence about what sort of members its chapters will let in. The growing number of bi-racial and muli-racial men and women will make this the case.</p>

		<p>African American greek-letter orgs do not discriminate; I&rsquo;ve seen white members of sororities and fraternities although it is rare. </p>
<p>The difference between white and black greek organizations is that for black frats and sororities, post-grad is where greek life actually begins. Black greeks are steeped in a tradition of community service, raising money for scholarships, doingmetor programs, etc. Do a google search if you&rsquo;re not convinced.</p>
