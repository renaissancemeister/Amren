			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Agence France-Presse, May 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>GOVERNMENT troops sodomised pygmies in March in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, believing they would gain supernatural powers, a regional rights group said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some soldiers from the 85th Brigade sodomised three male pygmies to gain supernatural powers and protection in Kisa village in Walikale territory,&#8221; the Human Rights League of the Great Lakes said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The village chief was stripped and (sodomised) in the presence of his wife, his children and daughter in-law.</p>
<p>&#8220;The children in turn were stripped and raped in front of their father.&#8221;</p>
<p>It said armed groups in the region also abused the pygmies.</p>
<p>Elderly citizens and children were also being raped by the armed groups and wayward FARDC soldiers in eastern DRC, it added.</p>
<p>The pygmies live essentially as subsistence hunter-gatherers in the forests in the DRC&rsquo;s equatorial zones and have been targeted by militia groups in the past.</p>
<p>Among the armed groups roaming the eastern part of Congo are the Rwandan Hutu Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda rebels.</p>
<p>Some of its members are accused of being among the main perpetrators of Rwanda&rsquo;s 1994 genocide by Hutus against the Tutsi minority.</p>
<p>The United Nations and global human rights organisations have accused the FDLR of engaging in mass murder, rape and pillage of locals&rsquo; property.<br>

			<p>This is mixed good and bad news.  While it is sad that this family was held and assaulted against their wills, I am heartenned to see that the villains seem to have found a less destructive way to obtain the supernatural powers than killing and eating the pygmys.  Whoever discovered that the powers could be obtained by merely raping them,  has inadvertantly saved the lives of many pygmy men women and children.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would prevent even more unnecessary suffering if a study were done which would determine whether the sodomy must be against the will of victim in order to be effective.  If the same degree of supernatural power could be obtained from merely paying a pygmy to let himself be sodomized, such would be a much less immoral choice.</p>
<p>Is there any description of which supernatural powers were obtained? (Please god don&rsquo;t let these villains get time travel!)<br>

			<p>I wonder if the Blacks would be so bold if the U.S. sent a shipment of M-16s to the pygmies and a few dozen Special Forces to train them.  I understand that the pygmies excel in field craft, tracking game and so forth.  Let them hunt Bantus.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m waiting on:</p>
<p>(1)  American immigration authorities to admit both the sodomizers and the Pygmy victims thereof into the U.S. for political asylum, and:</p>
<p>(2)  The Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL and Janet Napolitano to start fuming about anti-anti-sodomizing-of-Pygmies extremists.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s a terrible shame that this kind of babarism is going on in Africa and especially to pygmies, who pose no threat or harm to anyone. Though pygmies may be black in appearance, they are just simple beings, much like the bushmen, that really are not the cause of any major problems in Africa. It&rsquo;s the Bantus and all their descendants like the Hutus with their warlike nature and and unstoppable breeding that should be the worry of the world. The Western hemisphere would be a much better place without all the Bantus but it&rsquo;s too late now. They out breed all others and eventually will spread to all places that don&rsquo;t actively keep them out. </p>

			<p>Let&rsquo;s put the actions of these soldiers into social perspective. Male groups and individual men often engage in ritual activity to increase prowess and good luck. I went to a college where it was considered good luck to touch an ornament on a bannister before a test; the ornament&rsquo;s paint was worn off. If sodomizing pygmies puts the soldiers in a better mental state and provides some recreation, it is beneficial and in any event does the soldiers no harm.</p>
<p>Compared with the actions of the U.S. leaders, pygmy sodomy is rational and beneficial. Consider the following actions by Liberals in control of the U.S.:<br>
-Massive importation of non-Whites<br>
-Promoting Diversity<br>
-&#8220;Birthright&#8221; citizenship to all humans born in the U.S.<br>
-Schools devoted to Liberal indoctrination at the expense of education<br>
-Granting extra legal protection to homosexuals*<br>
-etc., etc.</p>
<p>Thus, compared to Liberalism, ritual pygmy sodomy is rational and beneficial.</p>
<p>*In my opinion, men who engage in homosexual acts should be given no more (and no less) governmental benefits than men who play golf, sing karaoke, or engage in any other hobby. <br>

Another absurd justification for the black man to have sex.</p>
<p>A few years back, an African gentleman claimed that his powers made him impenetrable to bullets. To prove it, he had people shoot him. Whatever powers he claimed to have didn&rsquo;t protect him from the bullets. A perfect candidate for the Darwin Awards.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope this group goes into battle believing they&rsquo;re unstoppable as well.</p>

			<p>There is a lesson here for Native Born White Americans:if and when the day arrives that non-whites are the majority in the military and police forces..they will go after Native Born White Males with a vengeance&hellip;.degradation,rape and murder in front of wives and children. This will be the price for spending decades sitting in front of a TV set watching young black mulitimillioniares in tight spandex running around a field.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in a recent post, I had first hand experience with the savagery of a recent arrival from  Africa. There are millions of Native Born White Americans who have no idea as to awaits them in the near future.</p>

<p>Since these are AFRICANS making victims of other Africans, why would anyone be surprised. The pygmie tribes had appealed to the U.N. for &#8220;protection&#8221; last year. The rebel troops were kiling and EATING them. But every time you figure Africans have hit the absolute bottom level, some Africans manage to go a bit lower still.</p>

			<p>Still another example of Africans too dim to know the difference between a REASON and an EXCUSE.  Those &#8216;Government&rsquo; &#8216;troops&rsquo; just wanted to engage in sadistic homosexual acts, and latched onto the nearest superstition as justification.</p>
<p>Sadism is behind the gratuitously horrific ways in which Hutus murdered Tutsis in Rwanda.  It&rsquo;s behind the unspeakable mutilations performed by Somalis upon their own daughters (in the name of religion), and an endless parade of atrocities too sickening to even mention.  The superstitions are just devices to enable the depraved acts.</p>
<p>That African mentality is an integral part of Mississippi&rsquo;s culture. People here who outrank me socially were raised by black servants, and seem to have been warped a little by that contact.  Male and female, they&rsquo;re like Blanche DuBois; frantically covering the lightblub of reality with a cheap paper lantern.</p>
<p>I love traveling to New England, and other IQ meccas, because the smart people who live there are less likely to live behind complex veils of ideologies, ruses, excuses, and justifications.  Other Mississippians find the direct and analytical nature of New Englanders and Mid-Westerners to be disturbing.  I find those things to be liberating.  And I&rsquo;m afraid you people living in those wonderful places will soon lose a lot of the clarity and rationality you now enjoy.  As blacks and browns move in, you&rsquo;ll find reality warped to fit their limited comprehension.  Kiss enlightenment goodbye.</p>
<p>As to those brave Bantu &#8216;warriors&rsquo;&hellip;..If you sodomize someone, it does not matter &#8216;why&rsquo;.  Sodomizing another person makes you a sodomite.  Sodomizing another male makes you a homosexual sodomite.  Rape and sadism cannot be excused, either: not by any justification.  Those things are what they are, and once you engage in those behaviors, they become what YOU are.</p>

<p>Very interesting post, Mavis.  But you must try to understand it from THEIR point of view, that sodomizing another person makes THAT person the sodomite!   And that&rsquo;s not just in Africa;  they have the same warped, self-serving attitude here too.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t find people in the Midwest or New England of higher IQ or more enlightened. I find them much more naive and sheltered than Southerners or Californians. People in Mississippi or other areas with large numbers of Blacks or Browns have lived with these people for years or centuries so know and understand them well through personal experience. People in all-white northern areas, like Iowa or New Hampshire don&rsquo;t have a clue and buy into the diversity-is-our-strength ideology nonsense and live in their pie-in-the-sky lily white world. Their intellectualism comes from their ideas, not from real world experience. I&rsquo;d love to take all the Blacks out of Mississippi and all of the Mexicans out of California and put them in Iowa or New Hampshire. They&rsquo;d awaken to a whole new world.LOL<br>

<p>That reminds me of a time when I was sitting having a coffee outside a cafe, accompanied by my 4 year old niece, my sister, her friend and her friends daughter, aged about 4-5.  Their was a 4-5 year old black boy with his father ( I assume) and fathers white girlfriend/friend/wife/casual lay/live in lover, whatever she was.  The boy quite literally, sexually assaulted my sisters friends daughter, pushing her against a wall and putting his hand up her skirt. Not once, but at least twice, maybe more. When she objected, he PUSHED HER DOWN A FLIGHT OF STEPS!! We (white) adults were outraged by this behaviour, and confronted the (mixed race) couple, who at first, told us to &#8220;chill out, dey is only kids ya knaa&#8221;, then when we got angry at their attitude, started yellin&rsquo; and cussin&rsquo; as they tend to do, and calling us &#8220;racist&#8221;.  Eventually they left and took their disgusting little brat with them.  The kid would be about 22 by now, no doubt an experienced rapist.  I used to be very tolerant, but the more I have contact with &#8220;them&#8221; the more I really do resent sharing a planet with them.    </p>

			<p><i>When she objected, he PUSHED HER DOWN A FLIGHT OF STEPS!! We were outraged by this behaviour, and confronted the (mixed race) couple, who at first, told us to &ldquo;chill out, dey is only kids ya knaa&rdquo;, then when we got angry at their attitude,[they] started yellin&rsquo; and cussin&rsquo; as they tend to do, and calling us &ldquo;racist&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p>What I find most interesting above is their attitude this reveals. When something goes amiss, instead of ever taking the blame or responsibility for it, they get huffy and defensive and accuse YOU of being the one who&rsquo;s at fault.  There&rsquo;s something wrong with YOU!   You can&rsquo;t win   &mdash;    you racist, you!</p>

			<p>Anonymous 8:26PM:</p>
<p>Being a Mississippi girl like &#8216;Mavis in the X5&rsquo;, I can tell you that we are definitely not clueless when it comes to blacks.  Mavis surely knows that.  I get the impression from her posts that she grew up poor,  went to a no-nonsense school like &#8216;Southern&rsquo;, got a money degree, married someone similar, and is now one of those people who live in rich exurbs like Madison (probably within a few miles of us). She said once that she wants to buy a Maybach, so I assume she&rsquo;s doing really (!really!) well.  She would have no choice but to rub elbows with people who went to Ole Miss, which is the kind of place that churns out prime Southern Poverty Law Center candidates (and &#8216;Soul Food&rsquo; lovers, and Blues fans).  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from the same sort of background as Mavis&rsquo;, and while not (quite) a potential Maybach owner, can empathize with her about all the Blanche DuBois types you have to deal with, when you&rsquo;ve made it into the &#8216;upper-middle-class&rsquo; in this state.  These people would not know reality if it bit them on the butt.  I always wondered why: but the black servants thing makes perfect sense.  How could that NOT warp you?  Elites here are hypocrites about race, just like rich New Yorkers.  But their unreal sense of reality&hellip;.and complete inability to communicate ANYTHING honestly&hellip;.like everything has to be phrased in the most evasive, &#8220;diplomatic&#8221;, vague, and cryptic way possible&hellip;.yeah, I can see how you would talk like that if you grew up in a house where blacks were listening to everything you said&hellip;.and could hurt you, bigtime, if you said the wrong thing.  I think she&rsquo;s talking about mental damage from growing up around blacks, and not about Southerners being unaware of the black threat.</p>
<p>But I would expand on what Mavis said.  We Mississippians have deep problems, and those problems are possibly in large part due to two centuries of contact between the white population and blacks.</p>
<p>I wish there were discreet AMREN stickers we could put on the windshields of our cars, so I could spot Mavis in her (no-doubt white) X5, and wave to her when our cars pass at Renaissance or Dogwood Marketplace.</p>
