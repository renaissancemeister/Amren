<h1>Pa. Teens Cleared of Serious Charges in Beating</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Rubinkam, AP, May 2, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An all-white jury on Friday acquitted two Pennsylvania teenagers of all serious charges against them stemming from the fatal beating of an illegal Mexican immigrant last summer.</p>
<p>Brandon Piekarsky, 17, was acquitted of third-degree murder and ethnic intimidation, while Derrick Donchak, 19, was acquitted of aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation. Both were convicted of simple assault.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After four days of often conflicting testimony, jurors were left to sort out the facts of an epithet-filled brawl that pitted popular football players against a 25-year-old Hispanic man who appeared willing to fight.</p>
<p>Prosecutors cast Ramirez as the victim of a gang of drunken white teens motivated by their dislike of their small coal town&rsquo;s burgeoning Hispanic population. But the jury evidently sided with defense attorneys who called Ramirez the aggressor and characterized the brawl as a street fight that ended tragically.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The case exposed ethnic tensions in Shenandoah, a blue-collar town of 5,000 that has lured Hispanic residents drawn by cheap housing and jobs in nearby factories and farm fields. Ramirez moved to the town about seven years ago from Iramuco, Mexico, working in a factory and picking strawberries and cherries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fight began late July 12 when a half-dozen teens, all Shenandoah residents who played football at Shenandoah Valley High School, were walking home from a block party and came across Ramirez and his 15-year-old girlfriend in a park.</p>
<p>Scully asked the girl, &#8220;Isn&rsquo;t it a little late for you to be out?&#8221; That enraged Ramirez, who began yelling in Spanish and dialing friends on his cell phone. Scully admitted to shouting ethnic slurs. The verbal sparring soon turned into a physical altercation as Ramirez and Piekarsky traded blows, though prosecutors and defense attorneys disputed who threw the first punch.</p>

			<p>But I thought that rural Pennsylvania didn&rsquo;t have an immigration question to contend with.  That&rsquo;s what they keep telling us when Hazleton, Penn. mayor Lou Barletta wants to pursue ordinances and higher office.</p>

			<p>You can read another version of this story on CNN and see a pro-Ramirez slant.  Either way, there are no winners.  These Liberals embolden these immigrants and then native-born Americans are expected to kowtow to them.  I consider the media to be enemies of the American people.<br>

			<p> What a difference different circumstances make! In the above story, the AP is at great pains to tell us in the first sentence that the two teenagers were acquitted by an &#8220;all-white jury&#8221; (&#8220;all-white&#8221; is liberalese for &#8220;racially biased.&#8221;) Also, a fight which escalated tragically is edited into a &#8220;fatal beating.&#8221;</p>
<p> And whose opinion is it that Piekarsky and Donchak were &#8220;popular&#8221; football players? &#8220;Popular&#8221; plus &#8220;all-white&#8221; equals &#8220;unjustified acquittal&#8221; in the AP&rsquo;s eyes, apparently. I also wonder what race the Mexican&rsquo;s girlfriend was. Could tensions over perceived miscegenation have contributed to the brawl? Notice that when it comes to a detail like that, the AP retreats into embarrassed silence.  </p>

This was just on Anderson Cooper, with Soledad O&rsquo;Brien doing the story. She referred Ramirez as an &#8220;undocumented&#8221; worker, said nothing about his 15 year old girlfriend, and nothing about him dialing friends on his cell phone for back up before the fight started. The way it was presented, it was clearly a hate crime, with the poor immigrant attacked solely because he was Mexican. CNN hasn&rsquo;t covered a story this badly since the Jena Six. Trust AmRen to give you the full story.</p>

			<p>Sadly, I suspect the racial make-up of the jury will see this decision overturned. Maybe the Feds will get involved in another case of &#8216;Get Whitey&rsquo;. </p>

			<p>Does everyone reading this understand that the boys involved PLAYED FOOTBALL? In case you dont, they did indeed PLAY FOOTBALL. The jury was also an ALL WHITE JURY. Somewhat hidden by this most fair and unbiased writer was the fact that the hispanic MAN involved was 25 and his &#8220;girlfriend&#8221; was 15. Notice how he gave their ages in the original story, 12 PARAGRAPHS APART. I wonder why? Admittedly some were very short paragraphs, but why not mention their ages together? My guess is the writer wanted to downplay as much as possible the fact that this mans actions constituted pedophilia. </p>

			<p>People are in jails all across the country for just this kind of STUPID stuff. When it&rsquo;s interracial, and whites are the victors, then and only then, which is rare, it becomes a racial incident (of course this incident has become a racial incident twice, because of the white jury). </p>
<p>Someones dead. Are they saying it&rsquo;s self defense? Kicking someone on the ground doesn&rsquo;t sound much like self defense. They&rsquo;re lucky to be getting such short jail time, if indeed that&rsquo;s how it works out. </p>

			<p>The federal government can still try Piekarsky and Donchak on the basis of alleged violations of Ramirez&rsquo;s civil rights. Because of the principle of dual sovereignty  &mdash;  the country and the states are separate entities, except where the states have voluntarily surrendered their powers  &mdash;  such a prosecution does not violate the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy under U.S. law.</p>

			<p>The 15-year-old female was a half-sister to pro-&ldquo;undocumented worker&rdquo; activist Crystal Dillman, 24, of Shenandoah.  Dillman was Ramirez&rsquo;s fiancé.</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/cfkaj3</p>
<p>Google Crystal Dillman&rsquo;s name, folks.  Here&rsquo;s a video of her holding a Mexican flag at an anti-immigration rally in Shenandoah:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/c4rqax" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/c4rqax</a></p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s an interesting bit of information concerning Crystal Dillman from the Republican &amp; Herald - McClatchy-Tribune News Service via COMTEX</p>
<p>Aug 22, 2008–FRACKVILLE  &mdash;  Borough police on Thursday charged a Shenandoah woman for stealing $50 worth of merchandise from Rite Aid Pharmacy at 452 S. Lehigh Ave., according to Chief Christopher Hand.</p>
<p>Hand said police will file a summary charge of retail theft against Kayla Weikel, 18, of 110 Pioneer Road, in the office of Magisterial District Judge Bernadette J. Nahas, Frackville.</p>
<p>At 2:05 p.m. Thursday, Weikel entered the store, picked up a package of Zantrex 3, a diet supplement valued at $39.99, and a First-Response pregnancy test valued at $9, and exited without paying, Hand said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The buzzers went off and store personnel stopped and questioned her. She stated she didn&rsquo;t have anything,&rdquo; Hand said.</p>
<p>After the store personnel found Weikel in possession of the items, she dropped them and got into a gold 2001 Dodge sedan, which pulled out of the parking lot and headed north, Hand said.</p>
<p>The driver was Crystal Dillman, 15 N. Main St., Shenandoah. The vehicle is owned by Ricardo Aviles Gomez, 340 S. Jardin St., Shenandoah. A 16-year-old female juvenile was also in the vehicle, Hand said.</p>
<p>Assisted by Gilberton and Shenandoah police departments, Frackville police stopped the car a mile away at Advanced Auto Parts, 6 Gold Star Plaza, Shenandoah, Hand said.<br>
Dillman was not charged in the incident.</p>

			<p><b>POTTSVILLE, Pa. (AP)  &mdash;  An all-white jury&hellip; </b></p>
<p>Highly post-racial opening there. No need to read the rest. </p>
<p>Apparently, the headline is inferring that, for the sake of fairness, there should have been illegal immigrants on the jury. </p>
<p>Searching the exact phrase &#8220;(AP) - An all-white jury&#8221; on Google yields 1,120 results. Many of the links are for the same stories, but it&rsquo;s probably fair to say the Associated Press has started at least a few DOZEN articles with the phrase &#8220;An all-white jury.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;Ethnic intimidation&#8221;? Yes, that only goes one way for white people. I&rsquo;m sure the Mexican was saying plenty or anti-white things to them.</p>

			<p>Yes, but now I hear on NPR that the Feds are considering pressing civil rights charges against these children. A conviction on civil rights charges can often carry more severe penalties than criminal ones. That would certainly be a bridge too far. A Hispanic criminalien in the act of statutory rape gets killed in a fist fight he starts, and the US government rushes in to lynch a bunch of white kids who were protecting themselves. Millions of citizen taxpayer dollars will be wasted on this travesty prosecution. And the costs to the parents for hiring lawyers will be staggering; remember, they aren&rsquo;t rich like the the parents of the falsely accused Duke Lacrosse players. </p>
<p>How is this NOT double jeopardy? Yet another outrage by our Minority Occupied Government.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think civil rights violation charges are going to stick here; prosecutors would have to prove that Ramirez was singled out because he was Mexican.  With Ramirez also yelling epithets at the time, this is going to be next to impossible to prove to a jury.</p>
<p>The good news here is that the boys had the guts to take their cases to trial; if I had my druthers, plea-bargains would be illegal and every case would go to a jury.  This would force prosecutors to prioritize their case work, thus eliminating the garbage charges they like to throw around.</p>

<p>Well, what else would one expect to find in a community that is 96% white?  Should the AP find that surprising? </p>
<p>I looked Pottsville up and found, furthermore, that &hellip; &#8220;Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 1.22% of the population.&#8221;</p>
<p>Therefore, an &#8220;all-white jury&#8221; is nothing newsworthy or even worth mentioning in this case.  </p>

			<p>For anyone who might be interesed in the girlfriend.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first day of testimony in Pottsville included the revelation that Ramirez had a sexual relationship with the 15-year-old girl who was with him in the park.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Roxanne Rector, testifying for the prosecution, said Ramirez had been her boyfriend for more than a year   &mdash;   since shortly after she turned 14   &mdash;   and they were on their way to spend the night at his apartment the night of the beating. She also said that days before, he proposed to her and gave her an engagement ring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That contradicted earlier statements that Ramirez was engaged to Rector&rsquo;s half-sister, Crystal Dillman, with whom he fathered two children. Judge William Baldwin would not let defense attorneys ask the girl about her relationship with Ramirez, saying he let her acknowledge it only to inform the jury of her interests in the case.&#8221;</p>
