<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8065583.stm">Archbishops Call for BNP Boycott</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, May 24, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Archbishops of Canterbury and York have urged voters not to let anger over the expenses scandal drive them to vote for the BNP in next month&rsquo;s elections.</p>
<p>Dr Rowan Williams and Dr John Sentamu said it would be &#8220;tragic&#8221; if people abstained or voted BNP at the local and European elections on 4 June.</p>
<p>They said disillusionment was understandable but voters should not allow their anger to be exploited.</p>
<p>The BNP said the bishops did not represent the public&rsquo;s views.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Great vigilance&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>In a joint statement, issued on behalf of the Church of England House of Bishops, Dr Williams and Dr Sentamu said the forthcoming elections were taking place &#8220;at a time of extraordinary turbulence in our democratic system&#8221;.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>BNP leader Nick Griffin said support for the party was now sufficient that is was time &#8220;the Church of England grew up and decided to sit down and talk with us about the issues that we are getting across for our supporters&#8221;.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>BNP spokesman</b></p>
<p>A BNP spokesman added: &#8220;We&rsquo;re the only people standing up against the new religion of multi-culturalism and the Islamification of Britain.</p>
<p>&#8220;These church leaders don&rsquo;t represent the views of the public. The archbishops were trying to make themselves relevant in the modern world and the Church should stay out of politics.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Rare direct intervention&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>On a European election campaign poster, the BNP has used an image of Jesus suggesting that he would vote for the party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Polly Toynbee, president of the British Humanist Association, supported the church&rsquo;s intervention to speak out against a party they considered to be unchristian.</p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s religious affairs correspondent, Robert Pigott, said the archbishops&rsquo; appeal had been a &#8220;rare direct intervention in the electoral process&#8221;.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In February the Church&rsquo;s general synod voted overwhelmingly in favour of measures to stop clergy joining the BNP.<br>

			<p>This is contradictory, because the CoE doesn&rsquo;t want BNP members to become clerical leaders.  If the CoE doesn&rsquo;t want the BNP to interfere with their business, then then it shouldn&rsquo;t interfere with the BNP&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>I have noticed that the long and relatively dormant UK Independence Party (UKIP) is now becoming &#8220;mainstream&#8221; all of a sudden.  My bet is that the establishment is astroturfing the UKIP to draw BNP votes away.</p>

<p>God Bless the BNP, if i lived in Britain, id know exactly who to vote for. A solid /good/ choice in an age of lesser evils. Best of luck to all who hail from the UK, in this election. </p>

			<p>Actually, I&rsquo;m glad they came out and said this as it will render the Church of England even more irrelevant than it has been. The sooner the Church is purged of these types, the sooner it can begin to regain some measure of credibility in what is becoming an increasingly post-Christian nation.</p>
<p>I always find it interesting that the BNP exploit circumstances for their own advantage, but the Lib-Lab-Con-UKIP cabal never do.</p>

I&rsquo;m sure plenty of other commenters will call out the Archbishops on the duplicity of their asinine statements   &mdash;   so please allow me to point out something else instead: </p>
<p>Notice how the BBC is now calling up the British National Party for QUOTES?  And they&rsquo;re now treating the BNP like the legitimate political party that they are! And they&rsquo;re quoting the party&rsquo;s charming and eloquent Chairman Nick Griffin like he&rsquo;s&hellip; oh, I don&rsquo;t know, like he&rsquo;s a human being or something!</p>
<p>As recently as ONE MONTH AGO the Beeb   &mdash;   like every other old-media outlet in UK   &mdash;   refused to do that. This is a MAJOR policy change on the part of the British MSM. </p>
<p>The NUJ&rsquo;s &#8220;Cordon Mediatique&#8221; against the British National Party   &mdash;   which EXPRESSLY FORBIDS British journalists from giving the BNP any coverage other than negative   &mdash;   is well and truly coming down. </p>
<p>And if the BNP win some seats in the June 4 EUros, some other things will start coming down, too&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d doubt a <i>single</i> monarch or Briton before Queen Elizabeth II began her reign would recognise the multi-kulti mess the &#8220;Church of England&#8221; (sic) has become.</p>
<p><i>BNP leader Nick Griffin said support for the party was now sufficient that is was time &ldquo;the Church of England grew up and decided to sit down and talk with us about the issues that we are getting across for our supporters&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost inconceivable that the &#8220;Church of England&#8221; (sic) <i>doesn&rsquo;t realise that the BNP may be it&rsquo;s only source of survival!</i> - or are they hoping that, if they appease the Muslims enough, they might make the Church the only &#8220;legal&#8221; dhimmi church in the Isles?</p>

<p>I wholeheartedly disagree.  The Church of England is an anachronistic and irremediably corrupt institution whose higher-ranking members seem more interested in touting the status quo in order to preserve their lofty positions than they are in tending to the spiritual needs of their core constituency (i.e. British Anglicans).</p>
<p>Nick Griffin and the BNP would better serve the people of the UK by simply ignoring the Church of England and focusing their energies and resources on building up their political following elsewhere.  If the current economic crisis continues, their membership (and influence) will rise, exacting an inevitable response from the government and its shills.</p>
<p>When that happens, British Anglicans will be forced to see once and for all &#8220;the Emperor has no clothes.&#8221;  They will then be faced with the following quandary: continue paying lip service to a dying institution that spews out a watered-down version of the Gospel, or throw their lot in with the only organization left in the country that offers them and their posterity hope for the future.<br>

			<p> If the nominal members of Britain&rsquo;s Church of England are as casual about observance, regular attendance, and the like, as recent history suggests, why would they suddenly pay such close attention to what a couple of &#8220;irrelevant&#8221; senior clerics, one of them not even British, say about a political matter?</p>
<p> If the two archbishops had suggested that the major political parties, mainly composed of incompetents, should be bypassed in favor of the BNP, I wager the leftists would be screaming that the church should &#8220;stay out of politics&#8221;! instead of the BNP&rsquo;s leaders saying it. It all depends on whose ox is being gored. </p>

			<p>At least the BNP is standing up for the rights of British people. The BNP can actually justify why British people should remain British. The Church of England, as far as I can tell, cannot make a case for why people should be Christian. When was the last time anyone heard the C of E actually say it was important for people to be Christian?</p>

			<p>its obvious that the elitists are determined to keep a boot on the necks of the people. the &#8220;established&#8221; parties closed ranks against the BNP. the media run smear jobs. and now the clergy is urging parishoners not to vote BNP. mind you, this is after they have all but driven the CofE into the ground with their nonsense and passed measures prohibiting clergy from supporting BNP. i agree with Question Diversity that the establishment is using UKIP as a decoy to siphon votes from BNP. clearly, there is only one party for change in this election. every other vote is for the establishment. so dont forget to vote BNP.</p>

			<p>That black Bishop [&#8220;Dr&#8221; John Sentamu] is an AFRICAN immigrant from Uganda that has NO BUSINESS telling the REAL British people how to vote. They get soooo brave when they come to White countries don&rsquo;t they. I&rsquo;d like to see the &#8220;Dr&#8221; try that stuff in Uganda- - he&rsquo;d have a &#8220;necklace&#8221; around his shoulders in a heartbeat! The BNP has already stated that should they come to power, &#8220;Dr&#8221; Sent&hellip;whatever, will be made irrelevant. He knows that if the BNP comes to power, there&rsquo;s a chance that he just might have to go back to-gasp- UGANDA!!!! No White girls\boys there, what WILL he do!!! Look at his face in the picture [original ar.], this guy is WORRIED!!!! GOD BLESS THE BNP!!!!!  </p>

			<p>When religion and politics mix it makes for bad politics and even worse religion.  In this instance Dr Rowan Williams and Dr John Sentamu should be quiet and realize that only the BNP can save Christianity in Great Britain from the Islamic hoardes that are invading that nation.</p>

			<p>Does the Queen actually have anything to do with politics in England or is the position just hereditary parasitism? The Queen used to be able to say &#8220;Off with his head&#8221; and OFF would come his head. Muslims fear no country&rsquo;s government and as soon as numbers are sufficient, they will challenge and even overthrow those governments.</p>

			<p>The churches are more interested in getting down on their knees to beg forgiveness for England&rsquo;s involvement in the African slave trade. Endlessly apologizing to coloured people sends them into rapture.  It&rsquo;s a comical display. </p>

			<p>The Christianity that I grew up with and hold dear does not dictate submission to the enemy in any way shape or form, else why did Europe wage the Crusades?  Why have Christian men fought for the right in conflicts such as WWII?  The Church of England can go to Hell, since that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s headed.  God bless the BNP.</p>

			<p>One would think that these Archbishops had plenty to think about without sticking their noses into politics. There&rsquo;s the Catholic child abuse issue, dwindling Church attendance, sell-off of Church property for conversion into mosques and disagreement about which one said what about the others. Now they want us to &#8216;forgive&rsquo; the corrupt Members of Parliament and let them get on with running (or ruining) the country. Anyway, if I have to account for all my income and pay tax, so should they. If American readers don&rsquo;t really understand what&rsquo;s happening in Britain, my previous sentence will explain everything!!</p>

			<p>The establishment politicians and the other new world order elites are trembling with fear because they know that the BNP are on the verge of a major breakthrough. These liberal nation wreckers know that if the BNP win seats in the  upcoming euro elections the party will have entered the mainstream of British politics. They are terrified! </p>
<p>It is very interesting living in England at the moment, there is a feeling that things are about to change. People don&rsquo;t buy in to the anti BNP propaganda of the liberal left in the way that they used to. They can see the destruction of the country before their very eyes and all the liberal excuses no longer hold water.I pray that my English brothers and sisters are waking up to the damage that has been done to our wonderful country. Time to punish the loathsome reptiles who are responsible. God bless the BNP!</p>

			<p>If we lived in a democracy the BNP&rsquo;s policies would be openly discussed and the public would be expected to make an informed decision.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we do not.</p>
<p>Both main party&rsquo;s now are pretty similar - the public is being given NO CHOICE.</p>
<p>We are the most law bound and watched people in the world (with the poss exception of North Korea). </p>
<p>Freedom of speech and association is gone. State Educational bodies brainwash our children. Private communications are surveilled. DNA is stored. ID cards on the way. We have a controlled media and a left wing State Broadcaster.</p>
<p>Even the State Religious Authorities are telling people how to vote and claiming that you cannot be a Christian if you vote contrary to their wishes - excommunication in affect.</p>
<p>These are the Mullahs of Multiculturalism, the Peachers of PC.</p>
<p>Dont forget - they support priest who engage in buggery and lesbian sex. They do not fight or even speak out about the persecution of Christians in muslim countries. they want Sharia Law in the UK.</p>
<p>They are barking mad.</p>
<p>Please, if you are reading this and not yet decided, vote BNP to break the mould. If you cannot vote then at least read their website.</p>
<p>www.bnp.org.uk</p>
<p>Give power back to the People. </p>
<p>This is the fight of our generation.</p>
<p>If we lose this then we, the white race, will be consigned to the history books - or slavery.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see. One of these prelates is an African, with no ethnic ties to Britain&rsquo;s indigenous peoples, and the other has advocated &#8216;shari&rsquo;a law&rsquo; as a possible alternative to Magna Carta.</p>
<p>What did St. John say, 2000 years ago?  &#8220;Little children, it is the last time, and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we now that it is the last time. they went out from us, but they were not of us; for it they had been of us, then would no doubt have continues with us, but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not of us.&#8221; - I John 2:18-19</p>
<p>May Almighty God have mercy on Britain, and may HE bless the BNP, who alone of all the fools in that foolish land, have the sense to see &#8216;Jerusalem in England&rsquo;s green and pleasant lands.&#8221; (with allusions to Blake and Parry)</p>

			<p>Will these two bishops give up their specialness, just as they want the British people to give up their specialness?</p>
<p>Will they put away their bishop&rsquo;s robes, their degrees, their special recognitions?</p>
<p>Will they open the doors of their churches to vodoo-doctors and jadoowallahs, just as they want Britain to open her doors to all, without discrimination? </p>
<p>Perhaps they would.</p>
<p>Christianity seems to have become a gigantic generator of egalitarianism.</p>

			<p>Fr.John is correct.</p>
<p> But do the Christians and pastors of today have any understanding at all about what the Good Book really says? Of course they do not. Just look around and see how &#8220;tolerant&#8221; the churches have become to our own detriment. They are a shallow of what there were meant to be.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Does the Queen actually have anything to do with politics in England or is the position just hereditary parasitism? The Queen used to be able to say &ldquo;Off with his head&rdquo; and OFF would come his head. Muslims fear no country&rsquo;s government and as soon as numbers are sufficient, they will challenge and even overthrow those governments.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am a member of The Monarchists League of which Queen Elizabeth ll is head.  My impression is that The Queen reigns in a time when the monarchy has symbolic significance for the sake of attempting to preserve British identity and tradition, but very little actual and zero direct power. </p>
<p>The Queen does have influence, however.  Just lately, something interesting has occurred.  When the BNP finally gained a few seats and the BBC was forced to acknowledge it, she was able to lend support by inviting its leadership to a royal function.  This is a good indication of the sort of way that the Crown may influence the fate of its people.  I have little doubt that if the British Crown had the power, it would have long ago put a stop to the policies that have now brought Britain - England in particular so near to national collapse.</p>
<p>As for the alleged parasitism, a study found that it cost the British subject the equivalent of ten cents a year to maitain the Royal Family (they have much wealth of their own).  Most British surveyed felt that so little was worth preserving the tradition of their Royal Family.  But that was about ten years ago&hellip;.  </p>

<p>Probably not, and the Christians are not taking the muslim menace seriously. Christians overall, don&rsquo;t seem to understand that there is no room, NONE WHATSOEVER!! for Christians or other religions in a muslim world and they will be treated so harshly that the Roman treatment will have seemed civil.</p>

<p>I was confused on such issues, until about 10 years ago when I had an Australian chat room buddy explain it to me.  Pushes in the UK for &#8220;de-monarchization&#8221; or &#8220;republicanism&#8221; isn&rsquo;t a freedom movement, it&rsquo;s a left-wing diversity/egalitarian thing.  Pushes in former colonies to &#8220;de-Britishize&#8221; institutions and the country&rsquo;s flags are the same thing.  At that time, Australia had a vote to un-Union Jack the flag, and it failed.  That&rsquo;s because regular people saw through the phoniness.  I therefore surmised that Canada once had a national flag with the Union Jack, and at CofCC conference several years ago, Paul Fromm confirmed my theory and even had various items for sale showing the former (&#8220;real&#8221; - Paul Fromm) Canadian Flag.  He told me that the move to change the Canadian flag to the maple leaf thing it has now was a Trudeauian putsch to &#8220;celebrate diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>In these instances, they don&rsquo;t oppose monarchy because they oppose monarchial power and support Jeffersonian republicanism.</p>

			<p>America desperately needs an equivalent of the BNP. The Republican Party has become a useless, impotent organism. No, I didn&rsquo;t mean organization; they&rsquo;re not organized. The Democrats, well, if you&rsquo;ve been in a coma for the last 50 years, you&rsquo;ll have to do some research on your own. The rest of you know what I&rsquo;m talking about. I pose a serious question. Has anybody heard of any grassroots political organizations who would challenge the insanity of multiculturalism and the extinction of the white society by non-whites in the U.S. today? Please, no smoke blowers. Anybody? Is there any hope on the horizon before it&rsquo;s too late?</p>

			<p>As an Episcopal, I can remember singing Onward Christian Soldiers every Sundy.  Now they sing Kum bhy ya.</p>
