			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Wallsten and Richard Simon, Los Angeles Times, May 27, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [T]he nomination Tuesday of Sonia Sotomayor to the high court brought a surprisingly muted response from the Republican senators who will actually vote on it.</p>
<p>The senators seemed to be taking their cues from quieter voices within the party who cautioned that opposing the country&rsquo;s first Latino Supreme Court nominee would amount to political suicide.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of Republicans are worried that [fighting the Sotomayor nomination] could be the last straw when it comes to the party&rsquo;s ability to reach the Hispanic community,&#8221; said Robert de Posada, a Latino GOP strategist who said he is advising Republican staff aides on the Senate Judiciary Committee. &#8220;Republicans are in a very awkward position.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lionel Sosa, a Texas-based Republican ad maker who designed Latino outreach for GOP presidents from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush, said that opposing Sotomayor &#8220;would be one more nail in the Republicans&rsquo; image coffin in terms of Latino voters.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The GOP&rsquo;s dilemma on Sotomayor is the latest example of the party&rsquo;s internal struggle over how to reinvent itself at a time that its voter base is increasingly dominated by Southern, conservative white men.</p>
<p>Some moderates have argued that the party must work to recruit more minorities and broaden its ideological foundation. But many leading conservatives have rejected that and see the latest Supreme Court vacancy as a chance to beat the drum on social touchstones such as abortion, gay marriage and affirmative action  &mdash;  while also revving up their fundraising machineries.</p>
<p>Only five years ago, President Bush won reelection by performing unusually well among Latinos for a Republican, winning more than 40%. Some Democrats were fretting over how they would respond if Bush were to nominate his longtime friend, Alberto R. Gonzales, who became attorney general shortly after the election, to be the Supreme Court&rsquo;s first Latino justice.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Obama] said that Sotomayor had shown that &#8220;it doesn&rsquo;t matter where you come from, what you look like, or what challenges life throws your way  &mdash;  no dream is beyond reach in the United States of America.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a Judiciary Committee member who also heads the GOP&rsquo;s Senate campaign strategy, told reporters that Sotomayor offered a &#8220;compelling American success story and something that we can all admire and respect about our country.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;While I celebrate Sonia Sotomayor&rsquo;s life story,&#8221; added Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), in a common refrain, &#8220;I am troubled by some of her statements. She deserves a fair and respectful hearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By falling in line and voting for the first Latino justice, some Republicans said, the party could create opportunity from the Sotomayor nomination. Supporting her might allow the GOP to regain enough credibility with Latino voters to neutralize any political benefit to be gained by Obama.</p>
<p>Then, De Posada said, if Obama does not act this year on his campaign promise to pass a legalization program for millions of undocumented immigrants, Republicans could make the case to Latinos that the president failed to deliver on their main issues.</p>

		<p>Again with the lie that Bush 43 got 40% of Hispanic votes in 2004   &mdash;   that has been proven false over and over again.  He got about 40% of Hispanic votes in certain Texas counties (none near the border), and in certain counties in Florida (read: Cubans).  Overall, he only got like 25 percent of Hispanic votes, and take out parts of TX and FL, even less than that.<br/>

		<p>&#8220;Sotomayer nomination splits GOP&#8221;</p>
<p>The GOP is dead. It is a party that will not fight for those who mainly support it  &mdash;  whites. The sooner it loses power the better. It will kill conservativism and conservatives, as sure as the sun comes up every morning. It will do so slowly, like the boiling frog concept. After what Ms.Sotomayer has uttered about white men, where is the justification for this so-called &#8220;split&#8221; in the GOP? The GOP is dead as a party that represents the interests of European Americans. Dead as a nail. That is why I previously wrote that I wouldn&rsquo;t even be surprised that they only continue to exist at the mercy of the Democratic Party. They sure as hell act as if they do.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not at all surprised that the voices of Republican senators are muted.  If anyone doubted the worthlessness of most of them, here is proof positive.</p>
<p>Unless whites wake up to the threat, we will eventually go the way of the American Indian.    </p>
<p>Democracy no longer works when a country is no longer homogeneous.  Giving alien people the vote results in conquest via the ballot box.  &#8220;Get Out the Vote&#8221; campaigns are not intended for us.</p>

<p>&hellip;and yet it has already been decided that the next Supreme Court justice will not be a white male.  So it DOES matter what you look like.  White males need not apply.</p>
<p>As for courting Hispanic voters, is nobody interested in courting WHITE male voters?  Obviously the Republican Party cares nothing for them.</p>

		<p>Pandering indeed.  If the Republicans in the Senate––or even a significant number of Republican Senators––support the Sotomayor nomination, the Republican Party will have betrayed its principles.  It may as well fold its tent and go quietly into the night.</p>
<p>But it is this amnesty angle that caught my eye: &#8221; if Obama does not act this year on his campaign promise to pass a legalization program for millions of undocumented immigrants, Republicans could make the case to Latinos&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>An amnesty bill is presently being drafted in Congress.  In its present form the bill would:<br/>
1.  grant amnesty to all illegals, including Central American gang members who promise to quit the gang if given legal status;<br/>
2.  free tuition for any alien who gets accepted to college;<br/>
3.  amnesty for nonpayment of past taxes and for filing fraudulent tax returns to obtain refunds or stimulus payments; and<br/>
4.  representation by a court appointed attorney in immigration court at taxpayers&rsquo; expense.</p>

		<p>I have not heard that Obama should pick the best qualified person, no matter who it is, and let the chips fall where they may. I have heard only from the media how swell it is that a Latina is the nominee. To heck with political suicide. We should not concern ourselves with filling affirmative action quotas.</p>
<p>Warning:  Leah Sears of GA (my lifetime home state) is a possible nominee for the next vacancy. She has been a justice here, including chief. She is black and was very lenient with a black thug who killed an older white woman and hurt her husband after they were kind but foolish enough to hire him as a yard worker. </p>

		<p>Republicans simply have to stand against the Sotomayor nomination on the basis of her own racist and judges-as-legislators comments.That alone would tell whites that their interests are being defended by the Republican Party. If Republicans can&rsquo;t even manage that it will signify that they are no defense against the racist Left and they will be abandoned.</p>

		<p>I was very heavily involved with a prominant &#8220;in your face&#8221; anti-illegal immigrant group here in California.  While it&rsquo;s members had the best of intentions, so many of them foolishly believed that it is still possible to &#8220;work within the system&#8221;.   I have come to the conclusion that &#8220;playing within the system&#8221; is a suckers game. Neither party stands up for Middle class White America, and both parties seem to be puppets for Globalists. At least Democrats seem to be getting something of long term value for its sellout. The GOP is doing it seemingly just for a few crumbs.   </p>

		<p>Yes, the Democrats are despicably playing the race card by insinuating that it would be racist to oppose Senora Sotomayer.</p>
<p>But is this any worse than the GOP in 1990 claiming that the Democrats were subjecting Clarence Thomas to a &#8220;high tech lynching&#8221; because of his skin tone?  </p>

		<p>Both sides are for the demise of the White American. Problem is most Whites are oblivious to this. Ever listen to the neocon talk shows and their hosts and callers? If a White caller happens to dare mention race and that it is the Whites that are losing their own country, all hell breaks loose. They are as bad as the leftists.  Never ever mention any truths about the blacks, mexicans etc or they will most certainly call you a racist. And please NEVER mention the fact that our Founders and the Constitution were for their own people (progeny) and never intended it to be used for nonwhites.</p>

		<p>This is terrific. The GOP must do what &#8220;Robert de Posada, a Latino GOP strategist&#8221; says to do. We MUST pander to the Hispanics or else the Democrats will end up with ALL 6% of these votes. It does not matter if they piss off and alienate 100% of the white base of the party. WE MUST have Hispanic voters!</p>
<p>Of course, this is nonsense. </p>
<p>So that MAYBE the Hispanic voters, all 6 percent of them, will MAYBE decide to quit the Democratic Party, and MAYBE vote for a Republican candidate, provided he (or she) is also Hispanic. </p>
<p>Lemmie see&hellip;..next we will go into a tailspin over the black vote? There are even more black voters than there are Hispanic voters. Well, maybe we need to go the extra mile to make sure the Somali pirates vote GOP too. Don&rsquo;t leave those votes for the Democrats! Make your base convert to Islam and pray to Mecca five friggin times a day or else the Democrats will get those votes.</p>
<p>The votes the GOP needs to win are not the Hispanics, or the blacks, or the illegal aliens, or the homosexuals, or the communists, or the Moslems. </p>
<p>The votes the GOP needs to win are its own party base&hellip;..which is rapidly slipping through its fingers. They need to win those white independent protestant and catholic voters, who were born in the USA, and really want it to stay that way. They need to win back the votes of veterans and patriots, conservatives and libertarians. They need the votes of professionals, business owners, middle class families, suburban housewives, and little old ladies in tennis shoes. The GOP has never &hellip;..as in NEVER EVER&hellip;..won an election by carrying the votes of ethnic minorities, communists, socialists, homosexuals, or atheists&hellip;..and now is not a good time to start&hellip;..as if they could.</p>

		<p>1)Republicans do not get the hispanic vote despite massive pandering to hispanics</p>
<p>2)Pandering to hispanics works;Republicans get a much higher percentage of hispanic votes</p>
<p>Either way Native Born Whites are written off by the Republicans. Suppose Republicans get the hispanic vote through hispandering, would this be a reason to vote Republican. Seems obvious to me that it would be reason to embrace White Nationalism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m supprised that some of you will concede so much to the enemy. Some of you here are allowing the enemy to define the terms of the debate. So if Republicans did get a higher percentage of the hispanic vote, it would be ok to write of Native Born White Americans? This is the framework that some of are buying into&hellip;whetther you know it or not.</p>
<p>Peter Brimelow foolishly accepts this framework for the debate. Who cares whether or not hispandering works or not for the Republican party..either way Native Born White Amerians are whited out of the Republiucan-Democaratic beltway consensus.</p>

		<p>Some of the posters above got it right. Republicans are expected to quietly accept this antiwhite racist because it would be politically impolite and offend potential Hispanic voters. What nonsense. </p>
<p>First of all, it affords an opportunity for the countercharge as Coulter, Gingrich, and Limbaugh have taken up, to blare out the &#8220;racist&#8221; mantra at her which often leveled at us! If nothing else it can make the reality of ethnopolitics more obviously visible to those whites who are in denial. Name-calling is the only thing these obtuse whites can comprehend.</p>
<p>Second, I held my nose and voted for McCain only because I figured he would choose someone better than Sotomayor. If the so-called conservative congressional republicans quietly confirm her, then vast numbers of white males like me will definitely sit out future elections and just wait for the total fall of the USA. The republicans have a chance to consolidate their white base or lose it along with an hispanic vote they&rsquo;ll never get.</p>

They might as well pack their bags, go home, and leave eveything to the Democrats and have a one party system.</p>

		<p>I was was watching an interview with Ron Paul explaining how difficult it is to run as a third party candidate and that you need a national brand to run for office.  It would be far easier for the right wing to take over the Republican Party than it would be to form a new party.  Look at what&rsquo;s happened since Michael Steele took over.  A gallup poll shows only about 20% of people identify as Republican now.  Donations are drying up and about half the base has abandoned them.  They aren&rsquo;t going to win very many races with those kind of stats.  The RNC leaders have to know that something is seriously going to have to give or they&rsquo;re finished as a political force.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Yes, but would YOU or any RATIONAL AMERICAN want the Democrats in full power for the next fifty years? A one-party system featuring the likes of Pelosi, Ted (All-American Traitor) Kennedy, or our current socialist prez, Obama?&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you understand that the GOP is just as dangerous to our people as the Dems are.  Right wingers support illegal immigration just as much as the left, and those conservatives that oppose illegal immigration are still for legal immigration.  They certainly do things a bit different than the left, but the end result is still the same - flood the country with non-whites, and screw white, working people.</p>
<p>The only good that can come out of politics is voting for staunch, white racialist candidates.  Other than that, don&rsquo;t vote.  We will never win by voting, and it only supports the system.</p>

<p>That will depend on how vigelent you aand millions of other Native Born White Americans are. The opposition against race-replacement has to occur from the bottom up..otherwise career politicians will move in and it will be more of the same.</p>
<p>Ron Paul is not an alternative to the Republican Party. Ron Paul&rsquo;s aracial free market politics is a blueprint for the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans. Ron Paul would do it through LEGAL IMMIGRATION.</p>

<p>This is why Ron Paul was not my first choice in the Republican primaries last year, Duncan Hunter was.  The racialist argument for Ron Paul, even though they admitted he was not one, is that his libertarianism would have the disparate impact of deconstructing anti-white government policies in employment, promotion, and so on, and that the hands of local white cops in the South and in big black cities would be untied.</p>
<p>Which is fine if you&rsquo;re in Mississippi, but that sword cuts both ways, the same sword which cuts fine if you live in Mississippi cuts horribly if you&rsquo;re a white doctor, accountant, or other professional in California, or if you are white and work in a call center in St. Louis (for not much longer, mind you.)</p>

<p>Better yet, don&rsquo;t vote at all. A vote for the Republican candidate only gives the Republican Party a false sense of hope that their pandering ways still have meaning. We need the American equivalent of the BNP, NOW!</p>

		<p> Forget about Hispanics. If the GOP has a future, which I doubt, they must pander to white people, and white people only. If McCain would have got more white votes he would be president today. This is how he lost it, a lack of white votes.</p>

		<p>Everything Sotomayor has said is perfectly in line with multiculturalist ideology. </p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t Republicans taking this time to shine a light on multiculturalism? </p>
<p>Just calling her a &#8220;racist&#8221; isn&rsquo;t enough. </p>
<p>They have to go to the source of these ideas. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Ron Paul is not an alternative to the Republican Party. Ron Paul&rsquo;s aracial free market politics is a blueprint for the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans. Ron Paul would do it through LEGAL IMMIGRATION&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Jupiter and QD:</p>
<p>I too found Ron Paul a troubling candidate, because of his stance on immigration, legal or otherwise.  Write what you will about Brimlowe, Jupiter, but he is quite correct that immigration is THE National Question (I would say Problem, not question).</p>
<p>As a Californian, I&rsquo;ve had a front row seat as to how unfettered colonization from the Third World can destroy entire cities, wreck school systems, increase crime, close hospitals, marginalize and push out native-born Whites and create havoc on the state economy due to the immigrants&rsquo; heavy reliance on government services generation after generation.  </p>
<p>California is on the brink of bankruptcy with the governor threatening armageddon unless we taxpayers cough up even MORE money.  Scharzenegger has never once mentioned the billions of dollars (10 billion/year according to Congressman Tom McClintock) that illegal immigrants cost the state.  Try it and you&rsquo;ll be called a White bigot.</p>
<p>Ron Paul is an Open Borders Libertarian and stated to Jon Stossel:&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;I think we could be much more generous with our immigration,&rsquo; and &#8216;If we have a healthy economy, we would probably have a lot of people coming back and forth working in this country.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor immigrants do not &#8216;come back and forth&rsquo;  &mdash;  they come to the US to STAY and then bring their family members over in legal chain migration to take advantage of White generosity (our Achilles Heel).</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s this from Ron Paul on Illegal Immigration:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;having an army to go around the country to round them up and put them in trucks and haul them out, that&rsquo;s not feasible&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>How does he propose to rid the country of illegal immigrants?  Or does he?  Does he support e verify?  He did not sign on in support of the SAVE act? No.</p>
<p>And this on the border fence:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.[Ron Paul] told John Stossel that he finds a border fence &#8216;rather offensive,&rsquo; and his vote for the border fence was symbolic&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>And finally this, why he sees no reason to have one unifying language, English:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Paul spoke at the Spanish Language Univision Debate. While there, he said, &#8216;I sometimes think that those who attack bilingualism sometimes are jealous, and we feel inferior, because we&rsquo;re not capable.&rsquo; He also agreed that there was a &#8216;negative tone&rsquo; to the immigration debate&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/l4o28p</p>
<p>After learning of this, I see he is no different from the mainstream parties&rsquo; candidates on immigration issues and seems fine with continuing country-destroying massive immigration.</p>
<p>Why would I vote for him?</p>

		<p>&#8220;A lot of Republicans are worried that [fighting the Sotomayor nomination] could be the last straw when it comes to the party&rsquo;s ability to reach the Hispanic community,&rdquo; said Robert de Posada, a Latino GOP strategist who said he is advising Republican staff aides on the Senate Judiciary Committee. &ldquo;Republicans are in a very awkward position.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>What has put Republicans in an awkward position are Latino strategists like Mr. de Posada.  They should fire him and everyone like him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some moderates have argued that the party must work to recruit more minorities and broaden its ideological foundation. But many leading conservatives have rejected that and see the latest Supreme Court vacancy as a chance to beat the drum on social touchstones such as abortion, gay marriage and affirmative action &mdash; while also revving up their fundraising machineries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Technically speaking, they should not be called &#8220;moderates&#8221;.  They should be called &#8220;nitwits&#8221;.  And can we leave abortion out of it?  Does anyone really care anymore?  After all the fulminations about this one topic over the last 35 years, there has been very little change in policy.  Abortion is still legal and still controversial - still championed by some, and abhorred by some.  The democrats will never abandon it - and let them have it -  honestly, the prospect of black and latino women aborting their babies doesn&rsquo;t really trouble me anymore.</p>
<p>And for the republicans, it is just an issue that they cynically use to squeeze votes out of conservative christians, while at the same time undermining them and their way of life in almost every other way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only five years ago, President Bush won reelection by performing unusually well among Latinos for a Republican, winning more than 40%.&#8221;</p>
<p>I will say again what I have said before:  What do you call someone who consistently pulls in 40% of the vote?</p>
<p>The Loser.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;While I celebrate Sonia Sotomayor&rsquo;s life story,&rdquo; added Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.),&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>What an insufferable idiot Brownback is.  &#8220;Celebrate&#8221;?  How exactly does he &#8220;celebrate&#8221; Sotomayor&rsquo;s life story?  With fireworks?  Waving the Puerto Rican flag?  Does he hold a barbecue in her honor?  Take the wife out for dinner?  Remember when the mid-west produced flinty old conservatives who talked sternly in clipped phrases?  Now it produces these blow-dried nothings who speak in cliches they seem to have picked up while watching the Lifetime Network.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Lionel Sosa, a Texas-based Republican ad maker who designed Latino outreach for GOP presidents from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush, said that opposing Sotomayor &ldquo;would be one more nail in the Republicans&rsquo; image coffin in terms of Latino voters.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Oh okay well they avoided that one, but in not opposing her they drove a nail in the coffin of White voters. Perhaps its about time to start our own ethno-political movement at least with a party nominally for us.</p>
