<h1><a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20090513/D985H2P02.html">&#8216;Old South&rsquo; Frat Targeted Over Confederate Event</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jay Reeves, AP, May 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A white fraternity that traces its roots to the Civil War and Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee is again facing complaints over its antebellum-themed events.</p>
<p>This time, University of Alabama alumnae are upset after Kappa Alpha Order members wearing Confederate uniforms and carrying battle flags paraded past a historically black sorority as the women celebrated the group&rsquo;s 35th anniversary.</p>
<p>The fraternity has been forced to halt its &#8220;Old South&#8221; festivities on some campuses because of claims of racial insensitivity, and Alabama members have apologized for pausing in front of Alpha Kappa Alpha&rsquo;s sorority house during this year&rsquo;s parade.</p>
<p>Alpha Kappa Alpha members said there was no confrontation or taunting, but they were shocked to see fraternity members in rebel uniforms and white women from another sorority in hoop skirts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some sorority members said the only solution is to stop the Old South event.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only acceptable apology would come with a promise to discontinue this event and recognizing that such an activity is hurtful and divisive,&#8221; said Willie Mae Worthey, an Alabama native who graduated in 1995 and now lives in Nevada.</p>
<p>Kappa Alpha was founded in 1865 at Washington &amp; Lee University, and the group calls Lee its &#8220;spiritual founder.&#8221; With 131 chapters from coast to coast, KA&rsquo;s &#8220;Old South&#8221; events were a fixture on many Southern campuses for years.</p>
<p>But those celebrations have met resistance at some schools.</p>
<p>The Auburn University chapter ended its annual parades in 1992 after black students confronted white students with Confederate flags. The chapter also stopped a tradition of covering the front of its house with a huge rebel banner.</p>
<p>Kappa Alphas at Centenary College in Shreveport, La., moved their Old South events off campus in 2002 after drawing protests from the Black Student Alliance and others over the Confederate garb.</p>
<p>The University of Georgia chapter canceled its Old South parade in 2006 following complaints by residents of a mostly black neighborhood, and administrators worked with the group to come up with a compromise.</p>
<p>There, members mounted horses and sorority members donned hoop dresses last month for what is now called the Founder&rsquo;s Day parade, but the festivities no longer include Confederate symbols and haven&rsquo;t created the same controversy as in the past, said associate dean Claudia Shamp.</p>
<p>&#8220;The elimination of the Confederate uniforms has helped. They have taken away some of the visual stimuli that led to rage and anger on some people&rsquo;s part,&#8221; said Shamp, who oversees Greek life at Georgia.</p>
<p>At Alabama, Kappa Alpha said it was sorry for interrupting the sorority&rsquo;s anniversary ceremony.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

			<p>Shame on Kappa Alpha (KA). </p>
<p>Shame on them for begging for forgiveness. </p>
<p>Shame on them for apologizing. </p>
<p>Shame on them for surrendering what little is left. </p>
<p>Shame on them for having no dignity of their own. </p>
<p>Shame on them for giving up all that is good and important for the sake of making friends they will never have.<br/>

			<p> Typically, the AP makes no effort to obtain any quotes from people who support the Old South frat&rsquo;s celebration   &mdash;   only blacks who voice the usual shibboleths about &#8220;hurtful,&#8221; &#8220;insensitive,&#8221; ad nauseum.</p>
<p> This is so typical of the way the mainstream news media covers such news events. The intent of the coverage is obvious: To make it appear that the Old South frat members are practically alone and friendless in their belief in honoring their heritage, and to push the &#8220;Southern history as told by the blacks only&#8221; agenda down all our throats. </p>

			<p>There is nothing wrong with Old South Events.If it is your heritage then stand up for it.What do you think these all black groups celebrate?Next time you see the black nationalist flag remember it is an offensive flag because of the hatred behind it.They shot white policeman and white fireman up here in the north during race riots under that flag.Its amazing how whites toe the line with any winey little complaint from blacks.The whites allow them to rip their heritage while they stick their black heritage in our faces.Stand firm!</p>

			<p>Why is it that the white people always have to stop doing something or give up what they enjoy? Why don&rsquo;t they just stand their ground and tell blacks it&rsquo;s not about them and to get over themselves? If you are not willing to defend something, then you don&rsquo;t deserve to have it. </p>

			<p>if the fraternity and sorority members were indeed harassing the black women then there is a problem but since like with all supposed &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; it is the perception of the alleged victim that makes an incident a hate crime. Basically all the marchers had to do was walk by the black sorority house for the women to be offended and the parade to be cancelled. In the other incident it seemed like the black students were the ones who were harassing the students in Confederate dress. Pretty soon absolutely nothing of Southern heritage can be celebrated for the all encoumpassing charge of racism.</p>

			<p>When American Indians celebrate their culture by dressing up in ceremonial head dresses and doing war dances, everyone applauds. If Blacks want to celebrate their African roots by wearing dashikis and observing Kwanzaa then that&rsquo;s a good thing. If Chinese want to preserve their customs by having dragon boat races and celebrating Chinese New Years then it&rsquo;s not a problem. Only when White people hope to celebrate their past is it met with resistance. </p>

			<p>What a surprise, what a shock.  You&rsquo;re telling me that something called &#8220;Old South&#8221; wants traditional Confederate uniforms and garb?  I&rsquo;d a never thought&hellip;</p>

			<p>I was married in my kilt and claymore.  Doubtless this would have been upsetting to someone at the park where we were married, had my wife not been wearing her best kimono - dark blue with silver cranes.  It probably would have just been confusing, instead.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know hoop skirts annoyed the multicultists so much.  If they do, should Sayaka buy one?  Where should she get patterns for one?  (She does most of her own sewing.)</p>

<p>Read: Blacks threatened (and probably caused) violence, because they didn&rsquo;t like what some white people did.  The whites realized they could not defend themselves without being charged with hate crimes, so they had no choice but to surrender.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m a lifelong Yankee and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind wearing a hoop dress.  :)  From what I&rsquo;ve read about the Old South, it actually sounds like a place/time I would have loved to have lived in.</p>

			<p>I say let the beautiful Southern belles parade in their luxurious hoop skirts and the proud sons of the South wear the Confederate uniform.  It is their right and their heritage.  The arrogant reaction from blacks (and white leftists) is to be expected.  Weather Undergrounder Bill Ayres (Obama&rsquo;s friend) was at Baltimore&rsquo;s Pratt library a couple of days ago to talk about his book on White &#8220;Supremicists&#8221;.  This lunatic, like many on the &#8220;progressive&#8221; left apparently still believes that whitey is responsible for all the world&rsquo;s problems.  Western Civilization was created by and is defined by whites.  Let us as whites stand up for and defend our heritage and our posterity.  Our European forebears are responsible for the most advanced societies in history.  Ever.</p>

			<p>This hits too close to home for me. As a member of KA I have done this dance too many times. Every spring when we have our Old South there is always some black organization who wants us shut down because of percieved racism. They see Confederate uniforms and automatically rush to end any activities that they deem offensive. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter that these complaints are filed by all black greek oranizations, which to me seems to be the epitome of racist.</p>

			<p>I couldn&rsquo;t finish this article. It made me too angry.</p>
<p>The people pushing, and pushing, and pushing won&rsquo;t be satisfied until every vestige of white heritage is removed.</p>
<p>And then perhaps whites themselves will have to be removed.</p>
<p>After all, it was whites who owned slaves, so who will want to see whites and be reminded of that era?</p>

			<p>Peter K. In the above post, say&rsquo;s about chinese boat races and black fraternity fests,. and complaints about white&rsquo;s celebrating their culture! Excuse but do people complain when White(Irish) people celebrate St. Patricks day? or White (German) people celebrate Oktoberfest? and or White (French) people celebrating Mardi Gras? and so on? so what are you talking about? Yes it is true that these minority groups are historically smaller in number so there ethnic fest&rsquo;s have been merged into race. that notwithstanding the above festivals are still essentially white celebrations!!!</p>

			<p>Perhaps the author needs to do some further research on origins of the fraternity. Washington &amp; Lee University did not exist in 1865.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that the AP simply drummed up the story as the result of a late night discussion about &#8220;hate groups&#8221;.  When someone mentioned the annual KA event, they went into action.  These KA events have been part and parcel of college life in the South for 150 years.  They are harmless and they celebrate the honor and tradition of a great people.  Southerners need not apologize for anything.  They simply need to know who their enemies are.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Some sorority members said the only solution is to stop the Old South event.&#8221;  Correction, the only solution is for minorities to shove it or leave.  How&rsquo;s that for an option?  Clearly, another example of why integration doesn&rsquo;t work, won&rsquo;t work and will never work, got it ?</p>

			<p>To Alabama Blak - St. Patricks day, Oktoberfest, and Mardi Gras have been diluted over the years into mere drunken parties, and as such they are no longer controversial, or &#8220;threatening.&#8221; That&rsquo;s why they can still exist.</p>

			<p>the solution is simple. those historically black sororities and fraternities should be given sensitivity training and forcibly integrated.</p>
