<h1>Data Show Minority Juveniles Arrested More Often</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, May 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With data showing black and Hispanic juveniles in New York arrested, detained and confined to custody far more often than whites, state officials are looking for ways to reduce that disproportion.</p>
<p>Data show minority children statewide are arrested almost twice as often as whites, are six times likelier to be detained awaiting trial and are five times likelier to be confined to custody afterward, according to New York&rsquo;s Division of Criminal Justice Services</p>
<p>The disparity is larger in New York City, where the state Office of Children and Family Services said 6,984 black and 3,966 Hispanic youths were arrested in 2006, compared with 966 white juveniles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the symposium, Barry Krisberg of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency said subtle, unrecognized bias is part of the problem. Laura John Ridolfi of the W. Haywood Burns Institute said approaches in other cities have worked after collecting information and discussing problems in the community. That has produced answers like phone calling Hispanic juveniles, with bilingual callers, shortly before a court appearance to make sure they show up, instead of later getting arrested on bench warrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Our white client base is almost none,&#8221; said Tamara Steckler, attorney with the Legal Aid Society&rsquo;s Juvenile Rights Practice in New York City. She said family court was once meant to divert youths from the criminal justice system, calling it now &#8220;a social experiment that has failed miserably.&#8221;</p>
<p>The most common charges on which minority juveniles are arrested are misdemeanors like shoplifting, graffiti, school fights and trespassing, where police have discretion not to make arrests, said Mishi Faruqui, director of the Youth Justice Program for the Children&rsquo;s Defense Fund-NY. {snip}</p>

<p>Client base.  Once upon a time, they called them criminals.  Nice to know if you&rsquo;re robbed by a &#8220;client&#8221; in the near future.</p>
<p><i>With data showing black and Hispanic juveniles in New York arrested, detained and confined to custody far more often than whites, state officials are looking for ways to reduce that disproportion.</i></p>
<p>The only way to do that is to arrest whites more often and for more tickey-tack offenses, or reduce minorities less, or somewhere in between.  My prediction is that they&rsquo;ll split the difference.</p>

<p>Now isn&rsquo;t that an absolute incredulous surprise?</p>
<p>I mean, like, just because we see the trouble and destruction and chaos they are involved with every day we didn&rsquo;t have a clue.</p>
<p>Can we call this a result of oppression or should we say it&rsquo;s racism?</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know what to do so I&rsquo;m going to say it&rsquo;s due to both.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m going to sit back and watch these PC geeks get stomped in the middle of a non-white mob just for being white.</p>
<p>When that happens, please excuse loud raucus laughter.</p>

			<p>Unrecognized bias is the problem? Laugh. It would be a lot more humorous if the problem wasn&rsquo;t black kids beating up on white kids and the authorities pushing it under the rug. Those poor black kids are desperate.</p>
<p>When gangs of black kids beat up passing white kids on occasion and the authorities only concern themselves with &#8216;hate speech&rsquo;, because racist whites are accused of using words, that&rsquo;s when you know there&rsquo;s bias.  </p>

<p>Nice try; no. As Richard Lynn explains in a back issue of Amren: &#8220;Just as racial groups differ in average IQ, they can also differ in average levels of other psychological traits, and racial differences in the tendency towards psychopathic personality would explain virtually all the differences in black and white behavior left unexplained by differences in IQ.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the same article, which can be found in the July &#8216;02 issue of Amren, Professor Lynn cites studies whose results would be predictable to anyone who&rsquo;s been paying attention to the news. Psychopathic traits are the most prevalent among blacks and Hispanics and the least prevalent among Asians and whites. Professor Lynn adds: &#8220;These differences are not only consistent through time but are found in countries such as France, Britain, Canada, and the United States, which have very different histories of what could be called &#8216;racism.&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>Sorry, Mr. Krisberg, but it appears bias has nothing to do with it. Go hit the books then get back with us.</p>

			<p>So whites assuming blacks are criminals or a white woman clutching her purse being around a black man is &#8220;rude&#8221;, but apparently it&rsquo;s &#8220;just an expression of rage&#8221; when whites are killed by blacks or white women are raped at 10 times the rate of white men raping black women.  Excuse me while I give a cynical and pessimistic laugh, my dear liberal friends.</p>
