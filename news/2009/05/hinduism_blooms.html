<h1>Hinduism Blooms in Triangle</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yonat Shimron, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), May 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The rose petals were the final flourish.</p>
<p>A helicopter flying above the Sri Venkateswara Temple on Thursday rained the red flowers atop the elaborate edifice honoring the Hindu god of wealth and well being. The temple is the newest addition to the Triangle religious community.</p>
<p>Thousands of Hindus from across the Triangle and beyond flocked to the temple off Chapel Hill Road during five days of ceremonies that concluded Thursday. Dressed in colorful saris and long tunics they sat or stood through hours of long ceremonies, snapping pictures and craning their necks for the best view of the proceedings.</p>
<p>Temple openings are rare events, and Hindus believe they bestow on participants health, longevity and prosperity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have never seen this kind of thing in India,&#8221; said Jyothi Gade of Cary. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are 21,000 native-born Indians living in the Triangle, but not all are of the Hindu religion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>House of nine deities</b></p>
<p>The $3.5 million building is made of cement with elaborately carved images of swans, lions and other mythic creatures. It houses statues of nine deities. The purpose of the consecration  &mdash;  really, an installation  &mdash;  was to bring these statues to life. At Thursday&rsquo;s ceremony, the stone statutes were carried into the building on a platform under a colorful umbrella. First though, they were bathed in holy water and dressed in specially made garments.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the largest of the statues, the 9-foot, 2-ton statue of Sri Venkateswara, began its journey from a shed on the property into its own special niche in the temple&rsquo;s holiest spot, the sanctorum. Sri Venkateswara is a powerful form of Vishnu, the supreme god, preserver and protector of the world. He wears a gem-studded crown, leaf-shaped earrings, snake-like armlets and is clothed in yellow fabric. In his hands, he holds the divine shanka, a shell, and chakra, a discus. His lotus-shaped feet are covered in precious metal. Drawn on his forehead is a sacred white marking called Namam that screens his eyes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Southern-style Hinduism</b></p>
<p>Orchestrating the festivities were six of the temple&rsquo;s resident priests along with 30 others from India, including a swami, or Hindu religious master, who came especially for the occasion. They chanted prayers in Sanskrit, which were broadcast to all the participants over several loudspeakers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The SV Temple, as it is called, is not the only Hindu temple in the Triangle. The Hindu Bhavan in Morrisville was founded in 1986 and represents a larger swath of Hinduism&rsquo;s eclectic heritage. But the SV Temple is the first in the region representing the particular South Indian tradition. There are Sri Venkateswara temples in Bridgewater, N.J., Pittsburgh and Chicago, too.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Devotion starts early</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The five-day ceremony cost $1million, but for many Hindus in the Triangle who began the project 13 years ago, it was worth it. Ram Nagulpally, who chaired the consecration committee, said the temple is a milestone for North Carolina Hindus. It announces to the world, he wrote, that the &#8220;Carolina community of Hindus has arrived.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is a direct consequence of the H-1B and L-1 B visa programs. In other words this is the direct consequence of the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans in the technology and medical fields.</p>
<p>I also think Southern White Males ought to find better things to do in their spare time than consuming sports entertainment. It really isn&rsquo;t that important if Bama beats Auburn&hellip;in the larger scheme of things such as the racial survival of Native Born White Americans.</p>

		<p>No. There doesnt need to be a Hindu community. This &#8216;Hindu community&rsquo; needs to be integrated. This so called &#8216;Hindu-community&rsquo; needs diversity. Anything less than, and until, proper diversity, is evil. Bold, naked evil. The continuation of a shameful legacy of evil, that, dare I say - can be traced back to India itself, and should.   </p>

		<p>No Hindu has any business being in this country except tourists or diplomats.  Besides the unwelcome racial differences, the caste system is utterly at odds with American values.  They are too alien to be accepted by anyone with a spark of American liberty.  Let them visit if they wish, be treated respectfully as guests, and go home.  <br>
     SKIP, they may be civil, but there is no common ground with people whose culture insists that I must follow in my father&rsquo;s footsteps rather that choose my own work.  I would not dream of interfering with them in their own land, and I respect what they&rsquo;ve done to raise themselves, but once you have one, you&rsquo;ve got 32 and then 348,962 of them, complaining about finding beef in their chicken taco.  We all know about chain migration here, so let&rsquo;s tolerate no foot in the door.  </p>

<p>Your post is another variation on the theme &#8220;race replacement of Native Born White Americans is ok if they are being replaced by asians&#8221;. It is not Ok. Post-1965 asians are actively participating in the destruction of centuries of Native Born White Engineering experience-present and future. The hindus own over 150 members of the US Congress who are members of the India policy group.</p>
<p>If there had been a National Origins immigration policy in place that excluded hindus, Native Born White America would have survived and done quite well producing America&rsquo;s medical doctors and Engineers and computer programmers. This is the dirty &#8220;little&#8221; lie that the hindus want Native Born White Americans to keep their mouths shut about.</p>
<p>How did Native Born White America survive all the years without hindus? Quite well thank you. I am opposed to the importation of even one hindu into America.</p>

		<p>Hinduism, as well as Islam, are as alien from traditional American Christian, or even secular, values, as I can imagine.</p>
<p> I sympathize with those who state that Indians and Hinduism are incompatible with the historic culture of the USA. I would say that at least these people speak English, albeit in an annoying sing song manner. Nevertheless, the day of &#8220;quotas&#8221; based on national origin are gone. LBJ with Ted Kennedy&rsquo;s help (Teddy was all of 33 or so) passed the 1965 Immigration law which eliminated national quotas and began polyglot immigration.  Many of us were preoccupied about such icons as King and Malcolm X, and the laws the Democrats and some Republicans were panting to enact, and they did. I recall at the time little opposition by conservatives or nationalists to the revolutionary and destructive Immigration law.</p>
<p><br>
Liberals and leftists successfully screwed America between 1963-1967. Even though so called conservatives ruled after &#8216;68, no one repealed the abhorrent Immigration Law and the unconstitutional &#8220;civil rights&#8221; laws. Only Barry Goldwater&rsquo;s warnings at the time that we were losing our nation remain as bitter solace of what we had and what we lost. </p>
<p>The rioters, Communists, Marxists and black nationalists abetted by liberal ACLU and National Lawyers Guild lawyers won.  They devoured and destroyed the Constitution. So,the Hindus are here, my friends, and more are coming, and more Muslims and Mexicans are coming too. You can&rsquo;t stop them. George W. Bush and John McCain represent the Republican Party on immigration, and they can&rsquo;t get enough immigrants from the weirdest most intolerant places on earth. Tom Tancredo is considered a wacko. </p>

<p>Nicely stated.  I&rsquo;m tired of the endless immigration into this country.  When will there be enough foreigners?<br>
In some countries, many of the cities must be empty as America is overran by the foreign born, illegal as well as legal. If these people are so great and wonderful, why are their own countries letting them go so easily and not making great efforts to keep them?  Obviously if they don&rsquo;t need them, neither do we.<br>
 <br>
America has been the greatest country due to the WHITE people who came here from Europe, not Asia, not Mexico, not Latin America or any other yellow, brown, or black country. </p>
<p>The most important inventions have been made by Whites, not asians.   Whites built America up, Asians and other foreigners are tearing it down, destroying it, changing it beyond recognition and taking over. They do not care about our cultural heritage or preserving it-they are supplanting it with their own. It doesn&rsquo;t even make sense-they leave their own countries because they aren&rsquo;t happy with things there, then come and make our country like their homeland.  Why leave in the first place? Oh yeah, there&rsquo;s all those free goodies-medical care, welfare, schooling for their children and they WILL be hired before White Americans.</p>
<p>These ppl bring in more crime, more disease-Dengue Fever, TB, Polio, whooping cough, leprosy, etc.  Many of these were eradicated from the U.S. are now back thanks to immigration. There are even NEW diseases coming into America from other countries-Asia included, costing us in terms of research(some of them we aren&rsquo;t sure how to treat), health and lives. As if that isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>Foreigners, including Asians use up precious, scarce resources (there are now many states with water shortages due to too many people), take away jobs from Americans who should be given preference in hiring, take some of the places in universities that white Americans should be given-how many times are we told how hardworking and smart these people are.  If so, why are so many of their countries of a third world status-those foreigners are the reason for that. Diversity/DIEversity is destroying America and it&rsquo;s greatness.  We are being transformed into a third world country, with third world crime (Asian gangs, hate crimes committed by Asians on Americans that are underreported for some strange reason, etc.), third world diseases, and third world culture.  Asians are contributing their share. </p>
<p>So many people-Whites included-are quick to say how the Asians are soooo smart and how well they assimilate, but that&rsquo;s not necessarily true.  They, like, the Mexicans form numerous organizations to demand all kinds of rights and are given hiring preferences when it comes to jobs displacing whites. They learn the system then tell each other how to &#8220;game&#8221; the system quickly, getting all the U.S. &#8220;freebies and goodies&#8221; available. They are clannish looking out for their own, hiring their own, and once you get one, they bring all of their relatives-mothers, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, grandparents-the whole village or greater. </p>
<p>When there are only a few, they can be really nice to you, but once they are established in large numbers, the Asians, like other foreigners, are not shy about showing disgust for whites.     </p>
<p>Whites are now a small minority where I live.  Just a few short years ago they were the majority.  It did not take long at all.  In fact, it was almost unreal. It&rsquo;s very hard to get a job unless you are foreign born or know someone and when it comes to hiring, the foreigners hire their own or hire other foreigners-seen it happen many a time.  Whites are being discriminated against in their own countries by foreigners and other whites who have self-hatred for their own race and see all other races as superior or more deserving.  </p>
<p>We need to get past worshipping all things foreign and learn to appreciate and protect what we have-not let it be displaced by anything foreign, including Asian culture and people. </p>

		<p>To say that all hindus support the caste system is like saying all christians support slavery (after all slavery system in the US was adopted by Christians).  If you take the time to read hindu texts, you will realize that the caste system is as related to Hinduism as slavery is related to being christian (i.e.not at all).  Before you start critizing another faith and calling it &#8220;alien&#8221; and incompatible with American values you really ought to educate yourselves.  Just like slavery was outlawed in the US, the caste system is being dismantled in India.  On the other hand Hinduism offers a lot of wisdom, whick it looks like many of you need.</p>

		<p>I do not care if there are Hindus who do not accept the caste system.  The great majority Do  accept it.  There are Blacks who don&rsquo;t rape and steal too, but I don&rsquo;t want to be around Blacks either.  The risk of their being the wrong kind is too high.  <br>
     Nor do I need to read the holy texts of Hinduism to ascertain the roots of India&rsquo;s social system, any more than I need to read the Koran to understand why Moslems act as they do, or read Karl Marx to understand Reds.  Their ways are not our ways, their ways are actually in conflict with our ways, and that is enough to know.  If some American is curious about India, lets them spend their time reading about it, but some of us would rather plant gardens or go swimming or read Steinbeck.  <br>
     If Indians and Hinduism are not alien and incompatible with American culture, what on earth is?  Are Americans not alien to India?  I did once read a book about Hinduism, called &#8220;Karma Cola&#8221;, written by an Indian.  The author held that wealthy American religious tourists were corrupting Hinduism.  <br>
     I do not doubt that there is much wisdom in the Hindu religion, which is accessible to those who grew up in that religious-cultural context.  At this site, many of us have our own wisdom, informed by experience, which is not easily accessible to those who do not share, or who ignore, our experiences.  </p>

		<p>The way I see it, the Christians continue to pump BILLIONS of dollars into India for conversion, and actually at times openly (usually its covert) back secessionist movements such as the NLFT.  Since White Christians feel like its okay to go so far as challenge the basic integrity of India, I don&rsquo;t empathize that much with the Whites complaint of immigration from India, even though its completely understandable on a mental level.  Because compared to trying to end Hinduism through conversion and backing secessionist movements, legal Hindu immigration pales.  I guess my point is, if you&rsquo;re going to play games with other religions and countries so much, Nature may throw it right back in a somewhat similar fashion (even if, as in the case of the Hindus, there is no idea to convert or destroy the nation-state of America - they just want to live the fading American economic dream - unlike what Whites want to do in India).</p>
<p>Besides, in the end the Hindus end up as mere observers to the Mexican flood across the border, and the *mostly* WHITE corruption in the government and financial sector.</p>

<p>I think white Americans have every right to criticize other cultures that they want out of their country as much as they want to.  Why does it matter to you?  Are you Indian?  Indians can be Indian in India.  They don&rsquo;t belong in America.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what you are getting so defensive about here.  If Indians don&rsquo;t want to be criticized then all they have to do is stay out of America and other white countries.  We shouldn&rsquo;t be forced to like Hindu culture if we don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p> If you want to discuss what is offensive it is the fact that Indians choose to live here but yet they won&rsquo;t admit that Western Civilization is superior.  That is what offends me as a white American.<br>

<p>Nature has nothing to do with. The race replacement of Native Born White Americans is a policy decision. The majority of Native Born White Christians want nothing to do with India. They couldn&rsquo;t even find it on map.</p>
<p>Policy can be reversed. And it will be reversed. If you do no want Christian missionaries in your nation,throw them out.</p>
<p>Anon at 11:32</p>
<p>You mean &#8220;normal&#8221; White Americans about post-1965 LEGAL IMMIGRANT asians stealing jobs from Americans? I am sure there are plenty of websites out there for them.</p>
<p>The post-1965 asians in America are actively participating in the destruction centuries of collective Native Born White Engineering experience-the destruction of future generations included.Why should Native Born White Americans be in favor of this?</p>
<p>The post-1965 asians and their gene-line in America expect Native Born White Americans to commit suicide. Native Born White Americans are fighting back and the asians eventually will be thrown out. They may have been very close to being thrown out during the weeks after 9/11. As one UCLA  hindu condensed matter physicist remarked:&#8221;they were the dark days.&#8221;</p>
<p>I want the hindus out of America. They are arrogant and pedatory. You do not belong in America. I want you out&hellip;all of you.</p>
<p>Hindus are not mere observers. They own over 150 members of the US congress who are menbers of the India Policy Group. The hindus and sihks have enormous welath and political clout. And they are using this clout to bring about the race-replacement and economic dispossession of Native Born White Americans.</p>

<p>I have no ill-will towards the millions of hindus in India. The same neo-liberal economic policies that are harming millions of Hindus in India are harming millions of Native Born White Americans. However, Hindus should be staying in Indian and fight the battle there.</p>
<p>The Middle Class Dream is dead in America. And as more and more Native Born White Americas wake up to this reality, there will be a corresponding revolt against post-1965 immigration policy. The revolt has already started. You and your fellow hindus in America shouldn&rsquo;t be shocked when the revolt goes full-blown.</p>
<p>There is a whole genration of young Native Born White Males-the ones being born every day and up to around the age of 28-who are never going to be able to earn enough $$$$$ to support a wife and children. They are going to be very intolerant towards asian &#8220;American&#8221; males of the same age with a wives,children middle class dream in the bag&hellip;and walking down tree lined suburbia with a golden retriever. The gasoline has already been poured into the basement. Eventually a match will be tossed in.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Well maybe that&rsquo;s a problem. Where&rsquo;s the white-interest&rsquo;s website normal people go to after visiting here and being frightened away? I would like to know. That is not a rhetorical question.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
You mean &#8220;the masses?&#8221;  The silent majority who are too afraid to hold radical opinions, let alone act on them?  </p>
<p>Let me say this.  We will never, ever win over the majority in our current position.  If we seized the TV networks, the schools, popular websites, and just about anything that influences people in this country, we could win them over.  Until then, the only people we need to concern ourselves with are the minority who are dedicated to our people, like some people who frequent this site, and the minority in power that oppose us.  </p>
<p>Amren is pretty tame compared to other white activists, which isn&rsquo;t always a bad thing, but if somebody is scared of the candor on this site, then they&rsquo;re useless to us.  </p>

		<p>The communists WERE right about one thing:  The West is a corruptor of morals and lifestyles.</p>
<p>If the US doesn&rsquo;t fracture into various enclaves in 2014, when the stimuls bubble bursts and the depression has been in full swing for about four years, I&rsquo;m betting it will be commonplace for the husbands to visit the nudie bars, drink alcohol and go berserk occassionally, when one of them sees his wife bumping and grinding in the nude in front of a large crowd of lecherous males.</p>
<p>Just remember, guys.  It was your choice to move here.  Sorry you weren&rsquo;t anymore successful in invoking your Hindu laws on us than the Muslims were in pushing for Sharia tenants.</p>
<p>Yes, I can just see you all now, raising your brew in about your tenth toast, while mama is on the stage drawing whistles and shouts.</p>
<p>Welcome to America.  Too bad your plans went awry to take us over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides, in the end the Hindus end up as mere observers to the Mexican flood across the border, and the *mostly* WHITE corruption in the government and financial sector.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Interesting comment&hellip;.  However when I checked the photos of the highest paid CEOs in America (and the ones who contributed to the financial debacle, three were Indian males, Two were females, one was Black, the rest were swarthy type males of Latin, Latin American or Middle-Eastern extraction with only two clearly identifiable White males, one of which was Rupert Murdoch.</p>
<p>Further, the corruption of India&rsquo;s political and industrial states has been legendary since the Independence of India in 1948.  The American businesses that I personally know of that have been purchased by Indians have near worthless stock due to the typical Indian CEO management style where every bit of capital that can be extracted from the business is taken for the personal enrichment of the owner CEO.</p>
<p>China cleaned out the American business sectors by freezing their currency, forcing the export of American jobs and businesses to China.</p>
<p>If one examines the recent (20 year) history of the trends in American business, it becomes clear that the international exploiters have been in charge for a long time.  The Whites that are left have been mostly GenXers who have a distinctly untraditional view of business ethics, meaning they have none - or adapted the practices of roque nations like China, etc., that view issues like piracy, bait and switch financial schemes, etc.  They created the so prolific practice of scam business because of the unregulated nature of the internet - especially in its early years.  Today, almost every business and personal service has some aspects of scam to it.  But sales and marketing contribute nothing real to any gross national product.</p>
<p>Indians and all these others are here for the money.  What they typically miss is that the wild policies that have taken root here actually immigrated from India, China, Africa, Latin America, etc., before them.  They contribute to the ongoing corruption by feeding it with their poor expertise and innate laziness.  But they have been watching America on TV for decades and they want to be us.  They are simply going about becoming us the easiest way they can while maitaining their primitive religions.<br>
