			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jane Atkinson, News of the World (London), May 5. 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A DEVASTATED young mum has told how she was raped by an illegal immigrant  &mdash;  because he enjoyed hurting white girls.</p>
<p>Brave Sarah Douglas waived her right to anonymity to relive her terrifying ordeal at the hands of Amos Moobeng and stormed: &#8220;This racist should be shipped back home to rot in jail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sarah, 20, came forward after the South African was sentenced to nine years in prison for holding her hostage before raping her after she went to his flat with a pal.</p>
<p>The judge told the court Moobeng, 35, &#8220;deliberately targeted two white females&#8221;.</p>
<p>But Sarah believes the monster has not been punished enough. &#8220;It makes me sick to think that this evil man came over specifically to rape and assault white girls,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He should be booted out of the country.</p>
<p><b>Justice</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Instead, while he has shattered my life, he has the dream life he came here for  &mdash;  a comfy bed, a TV to watch whenever he likes and hot food three times a day. Where is the justice in that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Police figures have revealed that immigrants are carrying out one in six rapes in Britain  &mdash;  and an astonishing one in THREE in London. And last month it was revealed Romanian Ali Majlat attacked a British woman so he could go to jail because his rapist elder brother wrote to him saying how cushy life was in our prisons.</p>
<p>Moobeng was on the run after his visa ran out when he targeted Sarah and her pal at a hotel bar in Exeter.</p>
<p>&#8220;He came over with his friend Benson and was being very over the top and flirting with my friend,&#8221; said Sarah. &#8220;I was pleased for her. She&rsquo;d been single for a long time so I went along with it when he suggested we go to a club.&#8221;</p>
<p>She only found out through Benson&rsquo;s trial evidence why Moobeng was so interested. &#8220;He said Moobeng had been making fun of me and my friend as soon as he saw us because we were white. He wanted to hurt us because we were white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Six-footer Moobeng then invited the girls back to his flat for a nightcap. It was there he pounced. Sarah said: &#8220;He jumped on top of me and started kissing my neck but I kicked him off. I told my friend I wanted to go home before storming into the bathroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next thing Amos literally ripped the bathroom door from its hinges and shouted, &#8216;Get out of there now&rsquo;. Then I saw him grab my friend and whack her round the face three times. I screamed at him to leave her alone. He just stared at me.&#8221; The girls fled the flat but in the panic Sarah lost her pal. She made the mistake of going back to find her. Moobeng was waiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard the locks turn on the front door behind me when I went inside. He grabbed my wrist and pulled me upstairs into a bedroom. He locked that door too. I was screaming, crying and kicking.</p>
<p>&#8220;He slapped me around the face and then ripped off my clothes and raped me.</p>
<p><b>Grabbed</b></p>
<p>&#8220;All I could do was shut my eyes and scream and scream. He was so strong and no matter what I did I just couldn&rsquo;t free myself. I thought I was going to die.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afterwards I ran towards the window to try and jump out but he grabbed me and threw me back on to the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I kicked and screamed but he pinned me up against the wall and punched and punched at me until eventually I must have passed out.&#8221; When she came to, she ran out of the flat to discover police  &mdash;  called by her friend  &mdash;  waiting.</p>
<p>Their sniffer dogs found Moobeng crouching behind the building but when arrested he gave a false name. He later jumped bail after the attack in 2007 but was tracked down to Edinburgh.</p>
<p>He was convicted of rape, false imprisonment and assault. Moobeng was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life and was told he would be deported after serving his sentence.</p>
<p>Now Sarah is trying to piece her life back together and has managed to find love since the attack. She and her partner Dave Koker, 23, have just had a baby girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m trying to move on, but I still have nightmares,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If I hear a man with a foreign accent I shake with fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;That man was pure evil and should never have been allowed into this country to attack me in the first place.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This story shows the difference between our &#8220;enlightened&#8221; new age society since the sexual revolution, and say, the England or America of one hundred years ago. It would have been considered absurd, at one time, almost unthinkable, for a lady to go over to the apartment of a man she hardly knows, for the purpose of having a &#8220;nightcap&#8221;. Tell me honestly, what time period was more enlightened, our present one or our past one? </p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s just the foreign accent, rather than the race, that causes her fear, she would be well-advised to get some tutoring from the BNP to learn what the real world is all about.</p>

<p>At least her compatriots can sleep safe, knowing that Michael Savage is barred from entry into the UK.  The important thing is that no black man was denied entry.</p>

<p>Why would anyone be happy that something like that was flirting with their friend? If my friend were responsive, I&rsquo;d tell her she was nuts. Just another victim of 3rd world immigration.</p>

			<p>She went to his flat, &amp; then she went BACK to his flat&hellip;?  I&rsquo;m surprised they got a conviction.  </p>
<p>Well, an expensive education, but one hopes she learned something useful to tell her daughter about the dusky types that will no doubt be ruling Britain soon.</p>

<p>While I dislike Michael Savage, I am relatively certain he has never beaten, raped or thrown acid on any British women.</p>

<p>This is a horror that could have been avoided.</p>

			<p>I agree with comments to the effect that women should be more discerning, use common sense and caution,  when starting relationships with men. I would certainly never date a man I met on the Internet. I would never have a relationship with a black man, or anyone from a third world country, or a culture very different from my own.  But white men also hurt women.  When I was 13, I was abducted, beaten and raped by two white men, a redhead and a blond. When I was 24, a black man attacked me on the street and attempted to rape me. I fought. When I was 30, I was brutalized by a college acquaintance, a man of Japanese descent. His was a Jekyll-Hyde transformation. I still like men, but brutality can be found in all races. It&rsquo;s sad, but a woman has to keep her guard up and not be trusting. </p>

<p>Just throwing this out here, but that does NOT, repeat NOT, sound like a Romanian name to me (my girlfriend is a Romanian). Could this guy be a Roma Gypsy? Romanians have gotten a bad rap for far too long because they have the misfortune of having a lot of non-European origin Gypsies in their country and have a similar sounding name.</p>

<p>No he&rsquo;s not. He&rsquo;s just your average run of the mill immigrant that you are allowing into your country. It won&rsquo;t be long before more people like him begin flooding into this country.</p>

			<p>Southern Hoosier: &#8220;If I was her husband, I&rsquo;d throw her out on the street. I wonder how often she been going over to strangers apartments for a &ldquo;drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does this sound like the words of a person with empathy? Rape is rape. It should not be condoned in ANY way. I may therefore also ask &#8220;What should become of a man who has been cheating on his partner?&#8221; Most misogynists would no doubt state that the woman should understand his feelings and that he finds her no longer attractive&hellip;. Cheating is wrong. In fact I think it should be against the law. But as the result of this foray, should never have been rape. I see that you may not sympathise with the rapist, but you show not a shred of pity for the woman. She has made a grave mistake and has paid far too great a price for it. The thug who did this should be on the next flight home to South Africa, where he should spend the rest of his days in one of their prisons(which are obviously infinitely worse than those in the UK). A much more suitable and fair punishment.</p>

			<p>She sounds like such a nice girl (sic) I just can&rsquo;t understand how this could have happened? Lets she, she goes up to a black strangers home for a few drinks, he uses her body to satisfy his own needs and she is surprised HUMM, I need to think about this ab oration for awhile. Sounds like her husband has quite a catch in having her as his wife?</p>

<p>Sara, I take it you are a beautiful woman. Beautiful woman should find a strong capable and honorable man to be by their side and defend them and go after any men who attack or threaten them in any way. That is how this was handled in the past. </p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s &#8220;liberated&#8221; women are fed the delusion that they can swim with the sharks and should survive on their own, never submit to any man, be independent in all ways as a matter of pride. The truth is that you have a duty to find a good man and submit to him and be a wife and mother to his children. He has a duty to be kind, considerate, and a good mate and husband and provider for you. </p>
<p>When you fail in your duty as a woman to bear children to continue the chain of life, you are betraying all that your forebears have fought hard for and cultivated within themselves. Why do you throw this away? For petty personal pride and narcissism? For something you saw on a magazine cover or TV commercial? </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m white and was out with some female friends of mine, all white as well.  Not saying the white guys behaved like perfect gentlemen at the dance club, but one black guy asked one of the young ladies to dance.  She politely refused.  He grabbed on her arm and she had to yank his hand away.  I was ready to get up and do something if I had to.  Luckily, that was all he did.</p>

<p>  Honestly, how could these women be so naive to go up to a complete stranger&rsquo;s room, particularly one who looks like Mr. Moobeng? I agree with Sara, women, as well as men, should exercise some common sense caution. Didn&rsquo;t their parents ever teach them the facts of life? With that said, I don&rsquo;t excuse the behavior of Mr. Moobeng. He is a dangerous criminal who should be put behind bars for a long time. He had no business being in Great Britain in the first place! </p>

<p>She shouldn&rsquo;t have been going to black&rsquo;s apartments for any reason in the first place. This is probably NOT the first time she has done this with blacks and rape is what 3rd world blacks DO to White women, especially 3rd world (African) black muslim men who see women as of no importance. SKIP the psychic predicts, she will do this again.</p>

<p>She does not have a &#8220;duty&#8221; to submit to a man and be a wife and mother. Marriage is an equal partnership and if she chooses to marry and have kids, that&rsquo;s great but she isn&rsquo;t failing in any &#8220;duty&#8221; if she doesn&rsquo;t. There are plenty of men today who don&rsquo;t want to &#8220;commit&#8221;. As far as the rape victim goes, rape is rape, and it is the sole fault of the rapist. He never should have been allowed into the country in the first place.<br/>

			<p>&#8220;&hellip; Beautiful woman should find a strong capable and honorable man to be by their side and defend them and go after any men who attack or threaten them in any way&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>In this day and age,  with the government refusing to warn White women of the huge number rapes blacks commit against them, and the msm refusing to publicize horrific crimes committed by blacks against Whites, a girl, whether beautiful or not, needs to learn to protect herself, with deadly force.</p>
<p>Do you believe in Women&rsquo;s Rights?  I do.  I believe a woman has a right to protect herself with deadly force!  Guns empower women, and women are robbed of that power when they are denied access to firearms.</p>
<p>She can&rsquo;t always depend on a &#8216;strong, capable, honorable man&rsquo; to hold her hand every single second.</p>
<p>According to John Lott, author of More Guns, Less Crime:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;rapists are particularly susceptible to this form of deterrence (a gun). Providing a woman with a gun has a much bigger effect on her ability to defend herself against a crime than providing a handgun to a man&hellip;A woman who behaves passively is 2.5 times as likely to end up being seriously injured as a woman who has a gun&hellip;&#8221;</p>

Teach your daughters not to make themselves vulnerable or put themselves into a position to be raped by blacks, but rather to avoid them always.  Teach your children the truth about the amount of black violence directed at Whites lest they become prey to these feral animals.</p>

			<p>&#8216;She does not have a &ldquo;duty&rdquo; to submit to a man and be a wife and mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She will soon when muslims and other non-whites are in charge of ALL of the Western nations </p>
<p>Why do so few understand:  Demographics is Destiny?</p>
<p>How soon before the women of Britain  &mdash;  hell, all of Europe, are required to wear burqas so they won&rsquo;t &#8216;tempt&rsquo; men to rape them?  Maybe 40 years?  How soon before the British and American flags are torn down, burned and spat upon  &mdash;  in public no less?  Christians and whites will be next.</p>
<p>After that, all women who experience rape will be subjected to stoning or worse because in the new masters&rsquo; &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; and &#8216;peaceful&rsquo; culture it is always the woman&rsquo;s fault and God Forbid she should bring shame upon her family.  With that, her older brothers are required to kill her.</p>
<p>Better yet:  Why do the British people continue to vote in Labour?  Why are you committing suicide in Britain?   And why is the US hell-bent on enacting the same policies?  Is it OK that your white daughters will be sold into slavery?</p>
<p>margaret:  The femi-nazis will be the first to be burned at the stake.  It would be amusing if we didn&rsquo;t know that we are next in line.</p>
