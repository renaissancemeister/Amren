			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Teresa Watanabe, Los Angeles Times, May 1, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Buoyed by perceptions of a bright political climate for immigration reform, thousands of activists plan to rally today in Los Angeles and nationally for migrant and labor rights.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At least seven marches are scheduled, including four in downtown Los Angeles, as traditional May Day celebrations of workers&rsquo; rights have expanded to include immigration reform.</p>
<p>Downtown march organizers are projecting between 20,000 and 60,000 participants, far fewer than the hundreds of thousands who turned out in 2006 to protest House passage of legislation that would have criminalized actions by illegal immigrants and their supporters.</p>
<p>The marches are still expected to snarl downtown traffic for hours, particularly when they converge near City Hall in the late afternoon. Several streets including 11th, Ord, Grand and Alameda will be closed. {snip}</p>
<p>Most of the groups agree on the same policy measures  &mdash;  legalize illegal immigrants, stop work-site and residential raids, and end the separation of families through deportations. Sharp disputes over the use of guest worker permits, meanwhile, were recently settled by two leading labor unions.</p>
<p>But Jorge Rodriguez of the March 25 Coalition, which organized the massive marches three years ago, said he failed in repeated attempts to persuade other coalitions to unify into one march. He blamed the failure on the &#8220;egos&#8221; of others.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hamid Khan of the South Asian Network said real policy differences divided the groups, one reason his organization planned to rally in Artesia this year rather than join the Los Angeles marches. He said he has not garnered much support from other coalitions for his group&rsquo;s concerns, such as how national security and immigration laws have been jointly used to detain and deport immigrants from Pakistan and other South Asian nations.</p>
<p>Nativo Lopez, whose Mexican American Political Assn. is now part of the Southern California Immigration Coalition, said he was unwilling to support measures that other advocates accepted, such as e-verify, an electronic method to confirm employees&rsquo; work status.</p>

			<p>So Nativo Lopez is against E-Verify, what a suprise.  I think deep down in his heart he knows that it works.  He also knows that is going to shut the lid on the daisy chain migration that has been such a thorn in our side for so long.  Losers like Lopez used to deny that E-Verify actually worked.  They lost that arguement.  Now the only thing they have left is to scream racism and jump up and down.  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve got to give them credit.  You won&rsquo;t see thousands of whites rallying for equal rights.  Which is why government and industry will unapologeticaly hire the children of those illegals over the children of whites over the next few decades after whites have finished picking up the bill for the mestizos education and medical care.  First step: equal rights, second step: equal wealth.  And whites are too afraid of losing what they have to do a thing about it.  </p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t make me feel better.  Right now, today, we have open borders.  Nothing, repeat nothing, is going to change this.  However, I think we can expect a surge of aliens with the elimination of e-verify.</p>

			<p>&#8216;Hamid Khan of the South Asian Network&rsquo;</p>
<p>Khan is a Pakistani name. Pakistan is a fast-growing country of 180 million people (more populous than Mexico), many of whom are keenly interested in colonizing English-speaking countries. </p>
<p>Pakistani migration is to Britain what Mexican migration is to the United States.  Pakistanis are very nationalistic and aggressive in advancing the interests of their ethnic family.  Terrorists of Pakistani origin have struck in nearly all Western countries, and Pakistanis often pursue the &#8216;soft jihad&rsquo; of political activism in the West, forming alliances with leftist liberal whites.<br>

			<p>It is utterly incredible that people who work in Los Angeles, are going to be grossly inconvenienced by these marches of thousands of illegal alien invaders. On the other hand, people living in Los Angeles, know that illegal aliens run Los Angeles. Que sera sera.</p>

<p>What a pity that is!</p>
<p>Of course, we must admit that seeing hundreds of thousands of criminals pour into our streets, did have a rather galvanizing effect on the slumbering American masses. I do not think that all of the combined efforts of: Numbers USA, the Minute Men, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, and other such honorable organizations, could possibly have done more damage to the cause of the &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; invaders as they did to themselves in 2006. Certainly, there is nothing quite like seeing an atrocious spectacle such as this freak show linked below, to jar Joe Six-Pack and Wilma Wal*Mart out of their collective stupors:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeTD3cNBnBU&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=CF89F4D1551FAF8B&amp;index=7" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeTD3cNBnBU&feature;=PlayList&p;=CF89F4D1551FAF8B&index;=7</a></p>
<p>Indeed, seeing some spasmodic chunks of Mexcrement in Che Guevara T-shirts, spewing  profanity and anti-American hatred (apparently the only English they know,) just makes such a profound statement as to where these invaders are coming from, that only Reds and other outright idiots could make excuses for them.</p>
<p>Of course, in this country there seems to be no short supply of those these days.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>Posted by anonymous</p>
<p>Yes, you will, but don&rsquo;t count on the media to report it accurately, fairly or at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Los Angeles KFI radio talk-show hosts &#8216;John and Ken&rsquo; recently gathered up a crowd of 15,000 in Fullerton, Calif., and destroyed DVDs, VHS tapes, and memorabilia of nominal Republican California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The rally was overwhelmingly White  &mdash;  and very angry.  Those of you in LA know that John and Ken&rsquo;s are railing against new, more punitive taxes that go to pay for entitlements for illegal immigrants and their citizen children  &mdash;  illegal immigrants that work in a cash-based economy yet are entitled to many expensive services such as free health care and education. </p>
<p>The response from the the local media outlets&hellip;..silence.</p>
<p>Response from the LA Times days later after outrage from local White taxpayers?:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;California Editor David Lauter wrote back to scores who asked about the event. The gist of his response: No, The Times didn&rsquo;t cover the rally. But yes, The Times has covered the issues that led to anger behind the rally&hellip; What we&rsquo;re not likely to do is cover a lot of individual rallies   &mdash;   from either side&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>I imagine he said this bald-faced lie with a straight face.</p>
<p>Yet today, when I picked up LA&rsquo;s &#8216;other&rsquo; paper, the Daily News (I refuse to look at the LA Times) there is slavish, front page coverage of the illegal aliens marches through downtown yesterday replete with color large color pictures  &mdash;  with promises of an entire photo gallery on the website.</p>
<p>Here is how the lead story of today&rsquo;s LA Daily News begins:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Thousands of activists marched Friday through downtown Los Angeles in a spirited pro-immigration demonstration&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Not one word about how much illegal immigration in California has bankrupted and ruined the schools, forced hospitals to close,  driven out White taxpayers, increased drunken driving on our roads, and most importantly, destroyed the once-wonderful quality of life in the Golden State.  Only sob story after sob story about how they want the full benefits of citizenship  &mdash;  mostly for the power to vote in their communist masters to increase their welfare payments and punish Whites. </p>
<p>Who do the papers think will pay for all the services these leeches demand and believe they are entitled to?  Who do the papers think will pay for these expensive entitlements after the last White productive business is forced from the state?</p>
<p>And lastly, who do the papers believe is their audience  &mdash;  the White taxpayers that they continually insult, or the non-White entitlement draining dregs who cannot read the media screeds in any language? </p>
<p>Both LA papers are in trouble  &mdash;  but will go down in flames before they report the righteous anger of Whites in this state against the destructive forces of illegal immigration.</p>

<p>No, severely punish american traitors who hire them and cut off any welfare to illegals. With no income, the illegals will deport themselves and they&rsquo;ll be no need for raids and families won&rsquo;t be seperated and the billions of tax dollars being spent on Mexicans can go back to being spent on Americans, the way it should be, problems solved.</p>
<p>PS-People above are right, until whites(and blacks) get off their backsides and start marching in the streets to take back THEIR rights not to lose jobs to Mexicans and to not have to pay for them, nothing will change.<br>

			<p>I live in South Carolina and the unemployment is in double digits YET! I see people I suspect of being illegals working in ALL of the landscape, construction, STATE ROAD CREWS etc. Around the corner from me is a family/Families!! living in a small home with 5 brand new pick ups and a couple of soccer vans in front, they look like they are from Guatemala or other central American country.</p>

<p>On the internet, I saw pictures of these marchers a year or two ago. The internet showed what they did when the mainstream cameras weren&rsquo;t rolling. I saw Mexicans and others using the American flag to sit on or wipe their sweat away, while they held their Mexican and other flags properly. They had signs that said &#8220;Americans go back to Europe&#8221; or communist slogans. Then when the mainstream cameras started rolling, they held the American flag high and held up patriotic signs. The mainstream media is so bogus and is the cause of a lot of this as they cover everything up.</p>

			<p>Two points:</p>
<p>* So the march is on a Friday? I thought all illegal immigrants were hard working individuals. Did they skip work or are they unemployed?</p>
<p>* Is it just me or is there a strong undercurrent of intimidation marching downtown on a weekday? </p>

			<p>Support  the revised (SAVE) Act as it targets employers with stiff penalties for hiring illegal aliens, secures the northern and southern border by adding 8,000 new border patrol agents and increases interior enforcement by allowing for additional federal district court judges and provides more resources for law enforcement officers.  In this package E-Verify would be mandatory, in-perpetuity driving illegal labor from the workplace.   Rep. Heath Schuler&rsquo;s e-verification program, would require federal agencies, contractors and employers to verify the eligibility of   &mdash;  ALL EMPLOYEES  &mdash;  within one to four years, depending on the size of the company.   Using this procedure, identity fraud wrought through fake social security numbers and bogus ID&rsquo;s would be reduced significantly. </p>
<p>This is not about discrimination because E-verify is activated after someone has been hired,&rdquo; Shuler said. &ldquo;This helps to ensure that local officials can identify who they arrest. Interior enforcement is crucial.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s essential that Americans back him and his sponsors when the act is introduced in the next few weeks.  This is namely after Sen. Harry Reid(D-NV) and speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) silently neutralized E-Verify, plus 48 other members of the Senate. We cannot trust these pro-illegal immigrant  &mdash;  PARIAH  &mdash;  cheap labor  &mdash;  BUSINESS politicians.  With over 12 million Americans out of work and large numbers of new veterans entering the workplace, we cannot accept any legalization of 13 to 20 million foreign nationals.

			<p>Let them &#8220;snarl traffic for hours.&#8221; It will just bring more anti-immigrant anger and outrage on them. Even from people who might have been favorable or neutral to the immigration issue.</p>
<p>Also please get busy sending e-mails and letters to Congress AGAINST amnesty of any kind. Use the links in the</p>
<p>frostywooldridge.com</p>
<p>website. Also urge everyone you know to e-mail, fax or write Congress. Amnesty is the Democratic Party&rsquo;s ploy to gain more voters for 2010 and 2012. </p>

			<p>Many of the security guards that work in California government buildings are employed by Securitas, a major employer of illegals.</p>
<p>They are a joke.  4ft 8 in, pure Indian features, tribal earplugs and speaking neither English nor Spanish but some primitive, illiterate stone age language.</p>

			<p>Here is a wonderful Somalia African immigrant adding to our diversity and diluting the dreadful hegemony of us White trash rednecks. I&rsquo;m sure that either the Lutheran or Catholic Charities of Minnesota will provide  a defense witness to testify that murder of one&rsquo;s sister is part of Somalian culture and must be respected.</p>
<p>Man arrested for sister&rsquo;s stabbing in Richfield A man was accused of stabbing his sister to death while she held her eight-month-old child. Richfield police said Guuci Beyena Mokonnen, 24, stabbed his 22-year-old sister in the parking lot of an apartment complex at 735 E. 77th St.</p>
<p>Police were called to the area just before 10 p.m. on Saturday on a report that a woman and her young child were bleeding. The woman had suffered stab wounds to her head and hand and a severe laceration to her neck.</p>
<p>Paramedics tried to treat the woman, but she died at the scene. Her child was not injured. Residents at the apartment complex told us they had to be evacuated for a time while the Hennepin County crime lab was on scene.</p>
<p>Bloomington police officers took Mokonnen into custody at Mall of America after he called their department and stated that he was involved in the incident. Richfield police forwarded the case to the Hennepin County Attorney&rsquo;s Office for charging.</p>
<p>The victim&rsquo;s child is now with his father.<br>

<p> Yeah! I remember seeing the first rally in Chicago. People were staggered by the enormity of the protesters. People said to themselves: &#8220;Man, we got a problem here!&#8221;</p>
