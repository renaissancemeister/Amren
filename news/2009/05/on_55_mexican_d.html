				With mariachis, tequila and parades, Cinco De Mayo will be celebrated this week in parties across the nation, kicking off a commemoration of Mexican heritage in the United States as a pseudo-holiday that has been adopted by the general population.
			</p>
			<p>
				But for Dagoberto Reyes, a Salvadorian immigrant living in Los Angeles, May 5 is more a reminder of the dominance Mexican culture has in a country that is home to immigrants from many Latin American countries. His prime example: Los Angeles-area public schools.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;Our kids go to this school system, and the school system is more preoccupied with Mexico&rsquo;s history, and not the rest of Latin America&rsquo;s, much less El Salvador&rsquo;s,&#8221; said Reyes, director of Casa de la Cultura, a Salvadorian community center. &#8220;They came back celebrating Cinco De Mayo. That holiday means nothing to us.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s a popular misconception that Cinco de Mayo is Mexico&rsquo;s Independence Day. The date actually celebrates the 1862 Battle of Puebla, in which Mexican forces stopped an invading French army. It&rsquo;s a date barely celebrated in Mexico and not in any other Latin American country.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip} Mexican culture has been the dominant Latino force in the United States, often leaving other Latinos to adapt or resent.
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s often as simple as commanding the dominant slang &mdash; for example, a jacket for Central Americans is &#8220;chaqueta,&#8221; but for Mexicans it is &#8220;chamarra&#8221; &mdash; but it can range to more overt hostility or competition in the work force, and it can spark worries of losing cultural identity.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Ignorance and apathy by Americans</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Ignorance and apathy by Americans adds to the mix.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;Not many of them know their geography,&#8221; said Diego Martinez, who has had to explain to several people the island nation of the Dominican Republic is not located in Mexico. &#8220;I like Mexican food very much, but I&rsquo;m Dominican.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				After Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean are the two regions that have sent the most Latin American immigrants. Salvadorians are the second-largest group of immigrants with more than 1 million.
			</p>
			<p>
				This population difference can mean a struggle for immigrants vying for better position in American society and in the country&rsquo;s economy, said Luis Guarnizo, a sociology professor with a focus on migration at the University of California, Davis.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8216;Latinos look for other Latinos&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				Immigrants seek connections to their homelands through music and other kinds of media, but in a place like Seattle, where the vast majority of Hispanics are Mexican, radio stations play Mexican music and television news is tailored to Mexican interests, said Jaime Mendez, who anchors Seattle&rsquo;s only Spanish-language newscast at the local Univision affiliate.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				Focusing on differences within the Latino community is not productive, undermines wider efforts and paints a broad brush over a complex issue, said Beatriz Cortez, coordinator for the Central American Studies program at California State University-Northridge.
			</p>
			<p>
				The immigration debate of the past couple of years, Cortez added, has also galvanized Hispanics to group together even more than before.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;It is important for each group to have its own space, as we do here in the Central American program, to construct the way we&rsquo;re portrayed. But at the same time, we&rsquo;re forming alliances,&#8221; Cortez said.

				In that, it is like St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day used to be, and that is, celebrated among the Irish diaspora outside of Ireland as a reminder of their Irishness, but not so much in Ireland itself. That has changed recently, as thanks to the recent &ldquo;Celtic Tiger&rdquo; economic renaissance in Ireland, the home country itself has adopted St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day as a major holiday as a source of pride.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, like St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, Cinco de Mayo has become an excuse for Americans not of either Irish or Mexican ancestry respectively to go out and drink.
			</p>
			<p>
				But the comparison isn&rsquo;t totally valid: The majority of Mexican-Americans today live in political jurisdictions that either they run lock, stock and barrel, or they co-run with pandering white liberals, and therefore get almost everything they can or want. And in the rare instance of that not happening, Mexico is right next door. The Irish needed and still benefit from reminders of their Irishness, the Mexicans bring and recreate Mexico with them, so why do they need every May 5 to remind them when it&rsquo;s all around them the other 364 days a year? I&rsquo;d sooner give the American Southwest to Ireland than Mexico.

				If one were to organize a cocktail party attended by four middle class Hispanics from every Latin American country, Spain, PR, and the US; the pecking order would soon be apparent as to culture. Mexico, PR, DR, most of Central America at the lower echelons with Spain, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Costa Rica, and Colombia at the upper echelons.

				This Cinco de Mayo phenomenon is bizarre. As I understand, it not much celebrated in Mexico, but is much more popular in the USA.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is an assertion of Mexican-ness which we should view with concern, considering that Mexico has irredentist designs on places like California. El Salvador and other Hispanic countries have no such claims on parts of the United States, but Mexico is another story. Therefore, we should not be celebrating their holidays here or giving them any sort of legitimacy that will only be used against us.

				Most people should know that Mexicans in Mexico don&rsquo;t celebrate the 5th of May.
			</p>
			<p>
				This was a phony holiday thrust on us by Mexican nationals and their supporters and apologies. What they wanted to do was create a Mexican version of Columbus Day or St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, only Americans have picked up on it and run with it. Every news broadcaster and weatherman I&rsquo;ve seen today has used this phrase and I can&rsquo;t wait for this day to end.

				Well, I can understand why other Latinos might be bothered by the hoopla surrounding everything Mexican. It bothers most people to see how it is purposely pushed by big business, and the past several administrations. Percieved brainwashing bothers people, especially if it&rsquo;s done by the government.

				To celebrate anything that has to do with the failed countries they left is the height of stupidity and arrogance.
			</p>
			<p>
				When they fled their old countries, surely they weren&rsquo;t satisfied with its opportunities, because they had to go to another country to find work and decent living conditions.
			</p>
			<p>
				I don&rsquo;t see large masses of people from European countries wailing about not being able to celebrate a holiday that was important in their own countries.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Irish have their St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade, but they&rsquo;re celebrating a religious figure that is a part of the religion of the entire country, and they do not try to push their holiday off on everybody not Irish, while the mestizos are doing just the opposite.

				If? I go to parties like this all the time, and I can assure you that there is no &#8220;pecking order.&#8221; One thing is clear, though, once we start speaking to each other in Spanish, typically around white Americans who may appear to be uncomfortable with so much &#8220;diversity,&#8221; the gringos fade into a corner and usually leave early.
			</p>
			<p>
				By the way, the Spaniards in the group, myself included, are always talking down the white Americans, often to their faces.

				The French had to retreat because they were low on ammunition. They would later return, capture Mexico city and ruke the country under Emperor Maximillian of austria. The french left because the USA was threatening to invade. As far as I know this is the only battle the Mexicans ever won.<br>
				The hispanics lack heros or any other anniverseries, We must not forget that the big hispanic hero is Che Givera who was defeated by the bolivian army.

				Cinco de Mayo is simply another way for Mexican-Americans to feel &#8220;included&#8221; and &#8220;integrated,&#8221; in this massive, multi-cultural catasrophe that&rsquo;s getting worse every day.

				No pecking order? Good one BI. That&rsquo;s a joke, right? I guess that&rsquo;s why all the telenovela stars look like Celia Cruz and Evo Morales, right?

				BI, every time Anglo-Saxons got our ducks in a row and engaged in armed combat with Spaniards or Mexicans, Anglo-Saxons won. Spaniards, Mexicans, Black Spaniard Insurgents, they can talk down Anglos all they want in cocktail parties. It won&rsquo;t last forever.

				If you are referring to true Spaniards and not merstizos, you must be living in the twilight zone, because Spaniards dislike blacks intensely, as well as mestizos.

				This concept of unity of &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; is meant to serve the ideologues and activists. Each nationality and ethnic group within this realm can have very hostile feelings towards others in the &#8220;group&#8221;. I have a Dominican brother-in-law who once said that if someone tried to equate a Dominican with a Puerto Rican there would be trouble.

				I could be wrong but I believe Black Insurgent has stated that his mother is Spanish, while his father was African or black American. I assume he holds Spanish citizenship. Of course, there may well be more than one poster claiming to be &#8220;Black Insurgent.&#8221;

				My father was one of those &#8220;gringos&#8221; and though he never learned to speak Spanish, we kids did. And it certainly came in handy to my sister who inherited his pale skin. When we were in high school the mexican girls would talk about her in spanish right in front of her face thinking this little gringa wouldn&rsquo;t understand them. Her favorite ploy was to let them talk for a while, then speak to them in spanish and watch their expressions. As the commercial says Priceless!! <br>
				The &#8220;gringos&#8221; probably leave because they know they&rsquo;re being talked about. They may not understand, but they can read facial expressions. Plus.. the gringos may have been lucky to have a friend like me, who informed them that when the hispanics start speaking in spanish it usually means they are being talked about.

				I&rsquo;ve got news for you Diego, not many people around the world know their geography and Latin Americans certainly don&rsquo;t as I&rsquo;ve found after talking to them. Anyway, why should Americans or anyone else know or care about Latin American holidays? Do Latin Americans know or care about &#8220;President&rsquo;s Day&#8221; or &#8220;Columbus Day&#8221; or 4th of July here in the USA? The answer of course in a big NO and I don&rsquo;t expect them to know or care.<br>

				That&rsquo;s right. We Americans want our own space, we want our country for us, not be colonized by a bunch of hispanics. Hispanics already have their own space back in their own countries and they need to go there or be sent back.

				So true. I&rsquo;ve met a lot of ethnic Spaniards in my life here in New York. I&rsquo;ve yet to meet one who liked blacks. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re out there, but here they&rsquo;re apparently a minority.

				It is a popular misconception that Spaniards in general like mestizos. While undoubtedly many of them do, most of the ones I&rsquo;ve observed here tend to avoid them. They look down upon them and seem to prefer the company of other Whites.
			</p>
			<p>
				A laughably embarrassing example of this occurred a number of years ago when the NYC Board of Ed. brought in a group of teachers from Madrid, Spain to try to &#8220;educate&#8221; the mestizos in this city&rsquo;s bilingual education program. All of them eventually quit and went back to Spain. I met one of them before she left. Her opinion of her &#8220;pupils&#8221; can&rsquo;t be printed here.

				&#8220;Black Insurgent&#8221; posts more ridiculous lies that he thinks will insult whites. Spaniards, as in people from Spain, detest blacks. I know because I am of Spanish descent, my parents are from Spain. We actually consider the &#8220;Spanish&#8221; speaking blacks and mestizos to be on a par with the uneducated Sub-Saharan Africans that still live a primitive existence that is below that of cavemen. Spaniards as a rule do not frequent &#8220;parties&#8221; filled with these people whose command of the Spanish language is nothing short of atrocious.

				&#8220;The French had to retreat because they were low on ammunition. They would later return, capture Mexico city and ruke the country under Emperor Maximillian of austria. The french left because the USA was threatening to invade. As far as I know this is the only battle the Mexicans ever won.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				That is very true. The major reason the Mexicans won the battle of Puebla May 5 is that the French had just landed and had not yet adjusted to tourista. They were laid low by dysentery. As soon as the Franch recovered, they resumed their march to Mexico City which they easily conquered.
			</p>
			<p>
				This was during the Civil War. The English sent major reinforcements to Canada. Both countries wanted to be ready if the South won the civil war.
			</p>
			<p>
				As soon as the war was over, the Americans let both the Mexican nationalists and the French know that the occupation of Mexico by a foreign power would not be tolerated and the US would invoke the Monroe Doctrine.
			</p>
			<p>
				So the French left. The Mexicans failed to prevent the French take over of their country. The Americans, not the Mexicans forced the French to leave.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once the Union won the Civil War, there was no point stationing French troops in Mexico as the whole point had been to possibly join with an independent Confederates States.
			</p>
			<p>
				The English withdrew the troops sent to Canada once the Union won the war as it was obvious the US would remain strong.

				&#8220;Real Spaniard&#8221; is right. Spaniards look down on blacks and Mestizos because they see them as they are. In point of fact, Spaniards and Italians find it silly that blacks from Latin America and Mestizos see themselves as &#8220;Latins&#8221;. They most certainly are not.

				&mdash; -If only we had practiced what we preached! Since the Monroe Doctrine specified that we would keep out of their (European) affairs if they would keep out of ours, it&rsquo;s unfortunate that it was the USA itself which broke its own doctrine by meddling constantly in European politics throughout the 20th century.<br>

				&ldquo;Real Spaniard&rdquo; is right. Spaniards look down on blacks and Mestizos because they see them as they are. <br>
				&#8220;&#8220;&#8220;&#8220;&#8220;&#8220;&#8220;&#8220;&#8220;`
			</p>
			<p>
				Spaniards, in general, are not all that fond of blacks &mdash; especially now that they have been getting so many of them. But there are always exceptions to the rule. And, until recently, they did not see that many blacks &mdash; who were to them a novelty at most.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, in BI&rsquo;s case, his father was a &#8220;black&#8221; airman stationed in the US Air Force,as I believe he has said. And that was long ago. So he would have been considered by Spaniards to be an &#8220;American&#8221; not African. Big difference. And Spain was a very poor country then, while Americans were considered rich. That makes a difference too. That &#8220;black&#8221; father, black by American standards, was probably not all that &#8220;black|&#8221; to begin with (not a pure African black, I mean). Therefore, I imagine that BI would not be that noticeably black after all - not to Spanish eyes anyway - but he&rsquo;s &#8220;black|&#8221; only by America&rsquo;s old-fashioned one-drop rule (which means nothing in Spain). Thus, It&rsquo;s quite possible that he considers himself &#8220;black&#8221; while they don&rsquo;t. Also, having a Spanish mother and relatives, and being able to speak colloquial Spanish surely helps a lot too. He&rsquo;s the exception, not the rule.
