<h1>Swine Flu Could Put Damper on Immigration Rallies</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sophia Tareen, AP, April 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The timing is not the best. Immigration-rights rallies are set for Friday as health officials try to clamp down on a swine flu epidemic with roots in the same country as many of the expected demonstrators: Mexico.</p>
<p>Public health officials on Thursday had not advised canceling large-scale events unless they were specifically tied to an institution or location with a laboratory-confirmed case of the illness. They urged people to stay home if they are sick.</p>
<p>Organizers of the May Day rallies, which have drawn thousands and even hundreds of thousands of people in recent years, said they would look to recommendations from public health officials about whether to cancel or modify the events.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re monitoring the situation to make sure that anything that is going to be conducive to the health and safety of communities is observed,&#8221; said Clarissa Martinez, a director for the National Council of La Raza.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some schools have closed because of the swine flu outbreak, and U.S. and Mexican officials have been urging migrant workers to take health precautions and get medical care if they feel sick.</p>
<p>The rallies come as illegal immigrants are being blamed on some conservative blogs and talk shows for spreading swine flu in the U.S. The outbreak is believed to have originated in Mexico, where there are 168 suspected deaths from the disease, before spreading to at least 10 other countries, including the U.S.</p>
<p>The only confirmed U.S. swine-flu death was of a Mexican toddler whose family was visiting relatives in Texas; many reported cases were among U.S. citizens who vacationed in Mexico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For most rally organizers, swine flu was secondary to promoting immigration reform, including pathways to citizenship for an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants  &mdash;  hopes buoyed with Barack Obama in the White House and a Democratic-controlled Congress.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s important for us to continue the fight,&#8221; said Margarita Klein with Workers United in Chicago, adding that union workers had been preparing for two months for Friday&rsquo;s event.</p>

		<p>Nobody EVER talks about it on the air, but isn&rsquo;t it an abysmal shame that a country like Mexico, with huge resources, has failed so miserably that it is necessary to beg other countries to take their unemployable rabble, because the government can&rsquo;t provide jobs for them?</p>
<p>Lou Dobbs said once about what a beautiful and prosperous country Mexico would be if the Taiwanese lived there.  Of course, he&rsquo;s right on.  If white Europeans were there in place of Mexicans the country would probably thrive even better than what the Taiwanese could do, also.</p>
<p>Such a sad shame to see a Mexican run down US streets with the Mex rag held high overhead, advertising a failed country that can&rsquo;t even feed its own people.</p>
<p>Right now they&rsquo;re on the verge of being taken over by the drug gangs there who have as many soldiers as the Mexican military and are armed almost as well.</p>
<p>Any kind of civil war is going to send millions more across our border in further visual testimony of the abject failure of Mexican ability to create a sustainable society in the midst of untold wealth.</p>
<p>What an embarassment it must be to its citizens knowing that only Zimbabwe and other black run countries are greater failures.</p>

<p>Of course the swine flu is secondary to promoting reforms for the sainted &ldquo;undocumented,&rdquo; upon which so many of our &ldquo;hopes and dreams,&rdquo; perhaps even the &ldquo;future&rdquo; of this country, is clearly so dependent. If they carry leprosy or bubonic plague, that should also be of secondary considerations too; in fact, if they are: perverts, rapists, murderers, or drug pushers, that shouldn&rsquo;t be considered as negatives in the least. </p>
<p>All of these assumed drawbacks that come with the &ldquo;undocumented migrants&rdquo; only add to the rich tapestry of diversity that they offer the USA. To say otherwise, is to wallow in racism and ignorance of the most base and reactionary of sorts.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right about Mexico.  Carlos Slim is anywhere between the 1st and 3rd richest man on Earth year in and year out.  A country that could produce a Carlos Slim has to have something for it.  But it&rsquo;s horrendously elitist, the white to white-ish plutocracy always finds ways to hog the wealth (perhaps that&rsquo;s why Slim has so much money), and encourages the &#8220;average&#8221; Mexican (mostly Amerindian/Mestizo) to &#8220;move&#8221; north.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m mostly opposed to Hugo Chavez style economic paradigms for America and other white countries, they just might be ideal for Indoamerica.  Notice that Hugo C. isn&rsquo;t publishing &#8220;migration guides&#8221; to show Venezuelans how to sneak across the US-Mexico border.</p>

		<p>Slim is a CHRISTIAN Lebanese. The distinction is important because the Lebanese Christians are a mercantile bunch and wherever they go they create thriving businesses. They&rsquo;re a lot like the Jews in that respect (but don&rsquo;t tell them that). The Muslims, particularly the Shi&rsquo;ia in Lebanon know only how to make babies and engage in violence. Of course they&rsquo;re now the majority in the once prosperous Lebanon. Their rapid growth relative to the Christians was the main cause of the civil war there.</p>

		<p>What an embarassment it must be to [Mexico&rsquo;s] citizens knowing that only Zimbabwe and other black run countries are greater failures.</p>

<p>I understand your point, ice, but for some reason there is no real connection between actual accomplishments vs. pride or humility.  Some people with high intelligence or who are gifted in other ways are shy and insecure.  Conversely, there are dimwitted, illogical people who are filled with a robust self-confidence.  Who can explain?  </p>
<p>With regard to Mexico, its people are proud of their country because of their tribal nature.  They think of themselves as a distinctly special group of people (&#8220;La Raza&#8221;).  Most have the same dark straight hair, dark eyes, brown skin, short height, and even similar voices in the mid tonal range.  They share a Spanish/Native Indian culture and most are Catholic Christians.</p>
<p>Mexicans come to America to make money and enjoy our free (for them) social services, not because they love the Constitution or our historical heroes.  In fact, most find &#8220;Anglos&#8221; to be too reserved and individualistic for their taste.  How often does one see Americans taking the whole extended family to the grocery store like they do?  Never.  </p>
<p>Because Mexicans move to America for economic reasons only, they miss their native land&rsquo;s culture and aim to recreate it.  With the encouragement of their government, Mexico&rsquo;s excess poor people are used as &#8220;foot soldiers&#8221; to expand its borders deep into the USA, while our troops protect other countries&rsquo; borders all around the globe!</p>

		<p>Those 2006 pro immigration rallies were all organized by George Soros through his employee Andy Stern and the Service Employees Union, composed of mostly illegal janitors and dishwashers.</p>
<p>The blacklash was so severe that Soros &amp; company decided to hold off for a while on their hispanic takeover program.</p>
<p>1919 Russia Lenin, Trotsky etc use the workers and peasants to take over Russia and send the workers and peasants into slavery, starvation and the gulag.</p>
<p>2010 America  Soros &amp; company use the hispanics to take over America.</p>
<p>Soros and Foxman&rsquo;s destroy America programs are a good lesson on the folly of not keeping strictly to the 1924 immigration restriction laws.</p>
<p>America let Foxman and Soros, unfortunate refugees from the nazis into our country.  They have repaid us by funding and organizing the extermination of Americans and our replacement by third worlders.</p>
<p>Madoff is going to prison.  Why isn&rsquo;t Soros?  His financial frauds and crimes are far worse than Madoff&rsquo;s.</p>
