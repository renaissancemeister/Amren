<h1><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/08/obama-enforcement-first-for-immigration/">Obama Reverses Stance on Immigration</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Dinan, Washington Times, May 8, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On the thorniest of political issues, President Obama has embraced the enforcement-first position on immigration that he criticized during last year&rsquo;s presidential campaign, and he now says he can&rsquo;t move forward with the type of comprehensive bill he wants until voters are convinced that the borders can be enforced.</p>
<p>Having already backed off his pledge to have an immigration bill this year, Mr. Obama boosted his commitment to enforcement in the budget released Thursday. The spending blueprint calls for extra money to build an employee-verification system and to pay for more personnel and equipment to patrol the border.</p>
<p>This security-first stance is not unlike that of President George W. Bush, Bush Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain, who said their immigration bill failed in 2007 because voters didn&rsquo;t trust the government to be serious about enforcement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration questions dog Mr. Obama. He was asked about the issue at a town hall in California and has been prodded by Spanish-language reporters, to whom he has given plenty of access.</p>
<p>But so far, even as he puts off a target date for signing a comprehensive bill, he has kept the support of immigrant rights groups, who applaud his changes at the Department of Homeland Security and say he&rsquo;s still committed to their top priority  &mdash;  a bill that would legalize most illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last summer, as a candidate, Mr. Obama said stepped-up enforcement had to be coupled with rewriting immigration rules and giving both instant legal status and an eventual path to citizenship for most illegal immigrants who are willing to pay a fine and learn English.</p>
<p>He also told the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials that comprehensive immigration  &mdash;  the term backers use for a bill that includes legalizing illegal immigrants  &mdash;  would be &#8220;a priority I will pursue from my very first day.&#8221;</p>
<p>But last month, on Univision&rsquo;s &#8220;Al Punto&#8221; Sunday political talk show, host Jorge Ramos tried to pin down Mr. Obama on his campaign &#8220;guarantee&#8221; that &#8220;we will have, in the first year, an immigration bill that I strongly support.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are absolutely right, the economic crisis has meant that I have been putting a lot on Congress&rsquo; plate,&#8221; Mr. Obama told Mr. Ramos, according to Univision&rsquo;s transcript. &#8220;So what that&rsquo;s meant is that just in terms of the calendar, I can&rsquo;t guarantee that I will have a bill on my desk before the end of the year.&#8221;</p>

			<p><i>On the thorniest of political issues, President Obama has embraced the enforcement-first position on immigration that he criticized during last year&rsquo;s presidential campaign, and he now says he can&rsquo;t move forward with the type of comprehensive bill he wants until voters are convinced that the borders can be enforced.</i></p>
<p>Note the weasel words:  voters *are convinced* that the borders are enforced.  Not that they actually are, but whether voters think they are.</p>
<p>Most amnesty and open border advocates claim with a straight face that they&rsquo;re for border security, and they can say that.  The reason is that their amnesty would just let everyone in anyway, so what immigration laws are there to enforce?  The only need for &#8220;border security&#8221; and the U.S.eless Border Patrol at that point would be to prevent guns from getting into Mexico.</p>

			<p>I maintain that this &#8220;enforcement-first&#8221; blather is just another euphamism for doing little to nothing to actually stop the brown tidal-wave, whether it comes from the left or the (pseudo)right! Just as with so-called &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; one should beware any talk of &#8220;enforcement&#8221; being some great new plan. The federal govt. has NO plans to enforce border security, no matter which party of clowns is in office.    </p>

			<p>Barak Obama is an anti-white Kenyan bigot who is waging a vicious race war against the Native Born White majority. His intent is to reduce Native Born White Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America.</p>
<p>During the election, Barack Obama appealed  explicity to the racial interests of hispanics,blacks,asians and blacks.</p>
<p>Although Native Born White Americans are starting to wake up, their racial dispossession is proceeding at a much quicker pace. Pray for severe draughts,severe economic depression and who nows what.The pain level has to be brutal. The sooner Native Born White Americans withdraw their support for the bipartisan beltway consensus the quicker the collapse of the goverment.</p>
<p>The good news is that millions of Native Born White Americans have already decided not to participate in legitamizing the beltway consensus by not voting . The remaining population of Native Born Whites who continue to paticipate need to get their teeth kicked out by reality.</p>
<p>Top priority:LET THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DIE..BURY ITS CORPSE. Peter Brimelow foolishly hopes for a revival of the Republican party&rsquo;s corpse. Because the Republican party is the political arm of the corporations, it will always betray Native Born White Americans. The Death of the Republican party would be a wonderfull thing&hellip;.the survial of Native Born White Americans as  large racial majority within the borders of America requires it. So my question to Peter Brimelow:Why would it be so terrible if the Republican party goes the way of the Dodo bird? Tell US why?</p>

			<p>of course what is really absurd is the ignorance or apathy of blacks who will be rolled over by the tens of millions of hispanics who will be &#8216;legalized&rsquo; or will be encouraged to come on in once the immigration bill is finalized. Blacks are finished except for the tiny number of high achiever, Ivy League types. The hispanics have no use for blacks-either back in Central America or here. Someday, probably after Obama is comfortably retired to a Georgetown mansion, blacks will realize that Obama did more to screw future generations of blacks than any Southern politician. Morons.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t believe a thing the administration says. Amnesty is part of a plan that the elite have to keep the transfer of poverty coming into the U.S. while the inheritance and wealth of the American citizenry leaves tht U.S. How blind can people be? Those college students supporting amnest and chain migration are supporting their own doom.</p>

			<p>If it&rsquo;s truly &#8220;Enforcement First&#8221; then the Feds need to deport each and every one of the tens of millions of illegals already here. After all, Federal law mandates the deportation of illegal aliens.</p>

			<p>Nice to know that 12 million illegals could be given US citizenship even though they lied and sneaked their way over the border. This sends out a clear message to criminals, do the crime and spend time in the US for good, what a pathetic liberal joke!</p>
<p>The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials is corrupt and should be disbanded. Why don&rsquo;t these lowdown hispanics learn English, pay taxes and assimilate? It is unbelieveable that Politicians don&rsquo;t see the dangers when lax border control is in place. Send them back to the third world and watch US crime go down.</p>

<p>We Whites are going to be run over anyway so it is better to have the Mexicans do it than the blacks. At least SOME of the Mexicans/Southerners DO WORK, the blacks from Africa come here and get right on the free train. Besides, the southerners have prettier women.</p>

			<p>I am dumfounded by the low mentality of American Blacks&hellip; who apparently cannot grasp the idea that the more illegals move in, the more Blacks will lose out. Mexican dislike of Blacks has been demonstrated time and again, despite their claims of &#8216;brotherhood.&rsquo; Predictably, should the day come when Hispanics come into real power, the biggest losers will be&hellip; that&rsquo;s right! You&rsquo;ve guessed it! Afro-Americans.</p>

			<p>Now Obama really is sounding like the 3rd term of liberal Yale Harvard girlyboy pretend Texan carpetbagger cheerleader silver spoon draft dodger spoiled brat Dubya since we know Lincolnite Bush allowed untold millions and millions of illegals in to do jobs nobody else would do building those millions of homes that were foreclosed on after marxist Lincolnite Greenspan lowered rates to 1% in 2002 and inventing the derivative scheme with his NYC bankers that led to disaster worldwide with 2.5 quadrillion toxic waste assets. </p>
<p>If people would simply examine the real truth of the Marxist Lincoln trail of sorrow they would see the root cause of everything gone wrong and who 50% of the white race has been eradicated in the past 150 yrs. </p>

			<p>The racial transformation of America is iccuring very rapidly. It is only a mattter of time before amnesty is passed-sometime in th next ten years.</p>
<p>If amnesty is passed, the very next day, it will be clear to everyone that a major political siesmic event has occured. It will be announced on the MSM the very next day. Along with this announcement will be the announced that political power of Native Born White Americans is over. Almost immediately there will be a massive restructuring of American society to accomodate the needs and interetests of the future non-white majority. ALso,nonwhites will be announcing to Native Born White Americans at work and at school and in the streets that &#8220;Native Born White Americans are history and what are you going to do about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that point in time, I believe a very rapid racial radicalization will occur in Native Born White America. This racial radicalization of Native Born White America will the match thrown into the basement full the brim with gasoline. Amnesty will provoke violent racial conflict within the borders of the United States. It is inevitable. But why would this be a bad thing? It would be the first step in repelling the post-1965 invasion.</p>
<p>Thomas Flemming would like to see all of us pack our bags and run of to Greece than stay and fight. Running away to Europe is not an option for a majority of Native Born White Americans. Here is the deal Ladies and Gentlemen:Europe is not an option. You either fight back and repel the invasion or Native Born White Americans will be a violently persecuted minority within the borders of America. There are no other options. If the Paleocons want to surrender and run away, the are fre to do it. The rest of us should act like  brave White Men and Women.</p>

			<p>I should also point out that it was Thomas J Flemming who launched his insulting  attack on Jared Taylor and White Nationalists a year and a half ago. Flemming was defeated in debate. Subsequently, he implemented a severe censorship policy on his web site. Paleoconservatism is another version of &#8220;America is an idea nation&#8221;.  Apparently, Thomas J Flemming wants to get closer to race-replacement enthusiast Kirkpatrick Sale. Go to Chronicles  and have a look at Flemming&rsquo;s post today. Here is the question for Thomas J Flemming:Are you in favor of the race-replacement of the Euro(White) American majority within the border of American? Or are you in favor of running of to Greek country side riding around in donkey-carts as a solution to this problem.</p>

Apparently blacks jealousy/resentment of whites is so great that they would rather support  the Mexican invasion even if its&rsquo; at their own ultimate exspense.  It&rsquo;s a case of cutting off their nose to spite their face.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like drilling a hole in the lifeboat to drown the guy who&rsquo;s sitting next to you. Even if you all go down.   Not too bright!  Sounds like an Elmer Fudd cartoon.</p>
<p>Of course, another factor is that blacks are not known for looking ahead very far either. That&rsquo;s why there are no black chess champions.</p>

			<p>Blacks who support illegal alien amnesty should reflect on howw poorly blacks are treated throughout most of Latin America.  Additionally, importing more impoverished minorities and then granting them citizenship simply means there will be less government program money available for blacks.</p>

			<p>Just how close does Thomas J Flemming want to get to race replacement enthusiast Kirkpatrick Sale? If you look at some of the comments in response to TJFs post &#8220;Nations of Immigrants&#8221; you can clearly see an early Paleoconservative move to embrace amnesty. Hey why not, if 60 million Nigerian immigrants are Church going Christians what is the big deal?</p>
