			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nia-Malika Henderson, Politico, May 19, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Buoyed by Barack Obama&rsquo;s election as president, a group of hip-hop artists and other activists is taking to Capitol Hill  &mdash;  trying to harness the wave of support for Obama among young voters into an ongoing political force.</p>
<p>The group, the Hip Hop Caucus, has a nine-member Washington office  &mdash;  but its real reach comes from its ability to harness the power of hip-hop artists to put a famous face on issues and draw in their young, multicultural fans.</p>
<p>In the next few weeks, the caucus will see a bill it fashioned with Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) be introduced  &mdash;  calling for funding for a one-day voter registration drive and lessons on the Constitution in high schools across the country.</p>
<p>Organizers are working with Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) to gather support for legislation fighting climate change  &mdash;  and singers Solange Knowles and Keyshia Cole have both signed on to help, through the Green the Block campaign.</p>
<p>And the group also reached out to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) to get support for prisoner re-entry legislation that would help former inmates transition back into society.</p>
<p>To the group&rsquo;s executive director, Lennox Yearwood Jr., the link between politics and hip-hop is a natural one  &mdash;  as a way to make politics more accessible to young voters, more like sports than study hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have a flier that says something about the economic stimulus package, versus one that has &#8216;Hip-Hop Town Hall, find out how you get yours&rsquo; on it, what&rsquo;s going to get a bigger draw?&#8221; Yearwood said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s the power of hip-hop.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rappers have campaigned for candidates before, but the hip-hop community hasn&rsquo;t been able to sustain the interest or the momentum when the election was over. Obama&rsquo;s election has led some in the industry to say it&rsquo;s time for the political side of hip-hop to get more serious.</p>
<p>And already there are signs that hip-hop artists seem to be sticking around this time. The HHC harnessed that creative interest into a get-out-the-vote campaign and used artists like Young Jeezy, T.I., Rick Ross, Busta Rhymes, Fantasia, Brandy and Big Boi to get voters to the polls.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>First formed in 2004 as an offshoot of P. Diddy&rsquo;s New York-based &#8220;Vote or Die&#8221; campaign and Russell Simmons&rsquo; Hip Hop Summit Action Network, the HHC sprung out of the disappointment from that election cycle.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet politics and hip-hop haven&rsquo;t always been an easy mix. While the roots of the music and the culture have political undertones  &mdash;  Grand Master Flash&rsquo;s 1982 hit &#8220;The Message&#8221; was a searing indictment of the decades-long neglect of urban areas  &mdash;  hip-hop has often been on the outside of politics, looking in.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>These days, Yearwood, 39, who often sports a Green the Block baseball cap, Hip Hop Caucus pin and clergy collar, is up on the Hill three to four times a week, meeting with elected officials and sitting in on hearings.</p>
<p>Their agenda is a progressive one, centered on health care, education, climate change and livable cities. Yearwood submitted a memo to Obama&rsquo;s transition team, has reached out to the EPA and the public liaison&rsquo;s office and is looking to work with the White House Office of Urban Affairs to push its agenda.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Members of the Congressional Black Caucus served as early mentors for the organization, back when the Hip Hop Caucus was still being confused with a rap group.</p>
<p>Now, 21 members of the CBC are on the advisory panel to the Caucus, which has field teams in 48 cities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hip-hop &#8220;opened doors to build friendships between African-Americans and Latinos and whites,&#8221; he said. &#8220;America became comfortable with the idea of a black executive because of all the hip-hop moguls.&#8221;</p>

			<p>God help us! I am thoroughly embarrassed by this administration more so than the last. As I thought that it would NOT get that bad. I was wrong. It will get much worse. I am ashamed of this country. This country is NO longer the land of my founding forefathers and has not been for many years! </p>

I want to have the utter lack of accountability minorities have when I speak.  I could say stuff like the above without anyone bursting out laughing in my face when I say something belied by trillions of dollars in &#8220;investment&#8221; in the inner cities since the &rsquo;60s.  </p>

			<p>&ldquo;America became comfortable with the idea of a black executive because of all the hip-hop moguls.&rdquo;<br>
Idealizing these &#8220;moguls&#8221; shows the culture for what it is, a culture that adores pimps, prostitutes and drug dealers. What does a culture that idealizes those things look like? <br>
&hellip;you don&rsquo;t have to look very far!</p>

<p>Thanks for that stunning insight into the rapacious hip-hop mindset, Comrade Yearwood. </p>
<p>Right there, is what is wrong with this country in general and nonwhites in particular; it isn&rsquo;t about the greater good of the country as a whole anymore, but only which mutant piglets get their chance to suckle at the decaying governmental teats, for some of the curdled green ooze they still have to offer. Oh how yummy, and how do I mine?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>I see no hope for the real America. The America that once was. A 95% White America. I have never before witnessed such apathy and cowardice on the part of Whites in this country and in Europe. So afraid of offending the &#8220;sensibilities&#8221; of some minority group, while minorities continually are free to offend us at every turn.</p>
<p> We are losing the numbers game due to the 1965 Immigration Act that brought in nothing but 3rd world peoples who reproduce at a rate that is astronomical. What nation could ever be expected to survive this DELIBERATE assault? The leaders responsible for this (and those who continue the assault) need to be tried for treason and never see the light of day. They have genocided our race, not to mention, even brag about it. Remember Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy and what they said about it? </p>

			<p>While I think that Young Jeezy, T.I. and Rick Ross are terrible artists and role models, you guys don&rsquo;t have to bash hip-hop like you do. Look at some REALLY old rap, I maen 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s stuff.</p>
<p>Grandmaster Flash&rsquo;s the message was about encouraging people NOT to do any of the bad stuff that goes on in hte ghetoos.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the song (no swearing or vulgar sex acts back then)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4o8TeqKhgY" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4o8TeqKhgY</a></p>
<p>Now I have a question for you guys. If Hip Hop was created by white men, would you still dislike it?</p>

			<p>T.I., one of the rappers used to promote this wonderful initiative, is going to jail for a year and received a hefty fine on his second weapons violation conviction. Young Jeezy, another rapper mentined in the article, has been named in a sweeping investigation on the Black Mafia Family, a major drug trafficking organization.  Both rap about similar themes, mostly selling drugs, living lavishly with the proceeds, and hurting and killing one&rsquo;s enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have a flier that says something about the economic stimulus package, versus one that has &lsquo;Hip-Hop Town Hall, find out how you get yours&rsquo; on it, what&rsquo;s going to get a bigger draw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sums up the project perfectly.  The implication is that you &#8220;get yours&#8221; not by earning it, but that you take &#8220;yours&#8221; from someone else.  Guess who that is?</p>

<p>You have just described the raison d&rsquo;etre of black gang activity.  All they are are drug distribution enforcers.</p>
<p>Every once in awhile, I&rsquo;ll hear some (usually black woman) politician, &#8220;nonprofit organization&#8221; head, activist, hack, loudmouth, etc. call for a &#8220;truce&#8221; of a certain number of days in the &#8220;gang wars.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is so ludicrous on a number of levels</p>
<p>First, if she has the power to stop &#8220;gang wars&#8221; for a certain number of days, why not make it longer?  Instead of, e.g. 30 days, why not 60?  90?  Heck, make it forever.  Furthermore, if she had the power to put a &#8220;truce&#8221; to &#8220;gang wars&#8221; now, then could she be held liable for all the &#8220;gang war&#8221; murders that happened in the past while she didn&rsquo;t call for a truce?</p>
<p>The reality is that she does not have that power.  It&rsquo;s all a PR bromide for the TV cameras.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the bigger problem with it.  She (and many of us) misunderstand these &#8220;gang wars.&#8221;  Are we to think that the violence between two street gangs in the ghetto is the moral equivalent of the French and Germans tossing grenaydes and firing cannons across the Maginot Line?  That&rsquo;s the kind of warfare that can be called to a true.  Black &#8220;gang warfare&#8221; isn&rsquo;t warfare, all it is is consequences for &#8220;stepping in&#8221; on somebody&rsquo;s drug distribution turf.  Asking black gangs not to shoot at each other is asking them not to make a living.  It is an occupational hazard, not warfare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I have a question for you guys. If Hip Hop was created by white men, would you still dislike it?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d dislike it <i>even more</i>, &#8220;Mookie&#8221;. FYI, a lot of that dislike comes from me being a musician who actually plays an instrument, live, in front of paying customers for actual money. (BTW did your mom name you after some Spike Lee character?)</p>

			<p>Mookie Williams:</p>
<p>I think you ask a question that is based on a moot point.  Hip hop could not have possibly created by white men, because it draws upon and appeals to black culture.  There are whites that poodle along, such as Marshall &#8220;The One Man Rebuttal to White Supremacy&#8221; Mathers (a.k.a. Eminem), Vanilla Ice and maybe a few others, but they&rsquo;re rare.  And their &#8220;music&#8221; isn&rsquo;t really hip hop, it&rsquo;s an imitation. </p>
<p>I am of the understanding that rap and hip hop are two distinct genres, though related.</p>
