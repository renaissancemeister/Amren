<h1><a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6256679.ece">Migrant Warns Africans Off &#8216;Misery&rsquo; Europe</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Campbell, Times of London, May 10, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>AN African in Paris is appealing to his countrymen to stay at home rather than risk their lives attempting to break into &#8220;fortress Europe&#8221;, where, he says, they will be miserable.</p>
<p>Omar Ba, from Senegal, in west Africa, says Europe is not the promised land imagined by Africans; instead it is almost impossible to find a job or somewhere to live and people are unfriendly to foreigners.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came in search of happiness,&#8221; said Ba, 28, in a cafe in Paris last week. &#8220;I found solitude and depression.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is luckier than most because his book I Came, I Saw, I Believe No More has turned the child of impoverished smoked-fish sellers into a minor celebrity and has put a human face on the plight of African &#8220;boat people&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ba, who grew up in a former leper colony, blames bad government in Africa rather than Europe&rsquo;s immigration policies for the tragic deaths at sea of thousands of would-be immigrants in recent years. &#8220;If Africa provided just a minimum for its people, do you think so many would leave?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>They are lured to Europe by hopes of prosperity drummed into them from an early age by a society reliant on remittances from overseas workers. Yet Ba soon discovered Europe was not the paradise that his family and teachers had promised.</p>
<p>The only white people he had encountered before reaching Europe in 2001 on an overloaded canoe were tourists on Senegal&rsquo;s beaches. &#8220;They were joyful and seemed to spend money without counting,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;They inspired me with envy and fascination.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was shocked to discover that some Europeans were homeless, poor and sick. Worst of all, they did not want to know him, particularly the attractive young women he had dreamt of meeting. &#8220;People avoided me,&#8221; writes Ba, who managed to enrol as a sociology student at the University of Saint-Etienne. &#8220;I made beautiful girls flee; to think that when I arrived I fantasised about having an affair with some ravishing blonde who would give me mixed-race children.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Europe is difficult for the natives, it is much tougher for immigrants, he writes. Even those who have lived in France for three decades are &#8220;piled up on top of each other in insalubrious apartment blocks&#8221;. Ba found a room but knew another immigrant who lived in a telephone booth. He often had to beg and rummage in bins. The only jobs on offer were sweeping streets or washing dishes and that was before the global financial meltdown.</p>
<p>&#8220;So now a lot of immigrants are homeless, they are turning to drink and crime,&#8221; writes Ba, who spent two years at a restaurant sink before getting a job at a charity. He notes that employment does not seem to make people less miserable: &#8220;Before stepping on European soil, I never knew what stress was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in Africa it is impossible to have a salary at the end of the month and be depressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>African immigrants prefer to perpetuate the myth about the good life, even if it means incurring debt to send money home to relatives who treat them as cash cows. &#8220;It is a matter of honour,&#8221; writes Ba. &#8220;We do not want to admit failure. The family would not accept it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many new immigrants find their main contact in Europe (a friend or relative who had promised to host them in style) mysteriously vanishes when they arrive. Yet nothing seems to damp the Africans&rsquo; overwhelming desire for Europe, not even the &#8220;rotting bodies that wash up on beaches&#8221; with horrific regularity.</p>
<p>Ba finds the human toll particularly shocking  &mdash;  his first experience of death was in a swell off the coast of Morocco. Another canoe had collided with a larger vessel and although they managed to pull the survivors on board, Ba will never forget the sight of his drowned compatriots.</p>
<p>In the Canary Islands he told the authorities nothing, following the instructions of the trafficker who had organised his boat ride. &#8220;If they don&rsquo;t know which country you come from, it is impossible for them to send you home,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>After two months in a &#8220;retention centre&#8221;, he was put on a flight to Barcelona. From there he hitched a lift to France in a refrigerated lorry and almost froze to death. He is no longer an illegal: after being expelled from France in 2002, he returned on a student visa. Yet he is thinking of going home, perhaps to work as a teacher like some of his eight siblings. He hopes others might follow his example and return to a country that needs them.</p>
<p>&#8220;This migratory wave is draining Africa of its lifeblood,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;I want young Africans to listen to reason. Europe is not worth risking their life for. There they will find only suffering and failure.&#8221;<br>

			<p>This is such a rare example of wisdom, I had to read the whole thing in the original to see if it was not a hoax or something.<br>
Near as I can guess, Mr. Ba is in earnest and not repeating something an operative paid him to say.<br>
Then again, you never know anymore.<br>
All the same, it is a shame that we are compelled to call the man wise who is only advocating things like &#8220;heeding the obvious&#8221; and &#8220;respecting your neighbor&#8221;, etc. </p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;If Africa provided just a minimum for its people, do you think so many would leave?&rdquo; he said.</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that would work, because they would still think that Europeans and whites have so much more, and they would &#8220;move&#8221; because they want some of that prosperity.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a reason why Africa does not &#8220;provide just a minimum for its people.&#8221;  Maybe Africa can&rsquo;t, or that it&rsquo;s just the nature of Africans.  Also, the writer&rsquo;s definition of &#8220;minimum&#8221; might be too lofty.</p>

  &mdash;  -</p>
<p>And there you have it in black and white: the primary motivation for black males migrating from Africa. What is surprising is his admission that beautiful girls run. Usually, the African male bravado says that white women can&rsquo;t stay away. If this guy can&rsquo;t find a white Marxist female to copulate with him in a French sociology department, he must really be in dire straights.</p>

			<p>This article helps explain a comment I heard last winter that puzzled me. I live in Canada, in a city to which Somalis have flocked to (like so many other cities in Europe and North America). The winters here are cold, with average temperatures below freezing for almost half the year. Yet last winter, at -30 below and windchill to boot, I was told that the Somalis loved the weather here in contrast to what they encountered back in Africa. I found it ludicrous that persons who had never experienced below-freezing temperatures would be supposedly luxuriating in conditions at which exposed flesh would freeze in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>But if they do not want to admit they made a mistake in coming, they will potentially deceive not only their relatives back in Africa, but also the native peoples in whichever white country they immigrated to. It&rsquo;s all about saving face, I suppose. And in many third world cultures, you don&rsquo;t dare admit having made a mistake, which helps explain why they have a tough time making progress in comparison to western nations.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s also the purpose of this sob story book. Just being a run of the mill African immigrant did not do the trick, so he is trying the pity angle combined with a bit of celebrity. He didn&rsquo;t complete his thought, though. It might go something like this:</p>
<p>&#8216;Of course, I would not stick around and raise these mixed-race children. Nor would I contribute financially to their upbringing. They would merely be a symbolic flag marking this anonymous ravishing blond as an easy sexual conquest and by extension brand her as permanent property of the African males sponging of the French welfare system. Then I would start the entire process over with the next willing white woman.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be sad Ba. Those blondes run from most White men too! They are running to Brad Pitt and George Clooney and similar men. Although if you keep looking you will surely find one dumb and desperate enough to breed with you.<br>

<p>What is concerning is that they express interracial ambitions and try to act it out with the tacit approval of white society.  If whites aren&rsquo;t doing something to stigmatze miscegenation, it appears to them they are being given the green light to pursue whites. </p>

<p>Exactly. It&rsquo;s high time people in Africa as well as Mexico and other parts of Latin America stayed home and demand a government that will give them jobs and such. Both Africa and Latin America have numerous natural resources. </p>

			<p>Let me get this straight. Mr Ba is complaining that the white women of Paris were not clamouring to jump into bed with an illegal immigrant who grew up in a leper colony? </p>
<p>At least he&rsquo;s telling his fellow Africans not to bother coming, instead of just doing what they&rsquo;d usually do with uncooperative femmes. Still, something about this story doesn&rsquo;t ring true. I thought there was no shortage of brainwashed multicultists in Europe who would jump at the chance to consort with an African.</p>

They had a documentary that brought up a lot of the same issues.  They relocated a bunch of Sudanese refugees to places all over the US.  In the film they follow around several of the guys with cameras.</p>
<p>At first the are giddy to be in the US, they have over-optimistic and unrealistic ideas of what it&rsquo;s going to be like.  They think that somehow everyone will welcome them with open arms &amp; (wallets).  The temporary aide money quickly runs out and they have to get sucky jobs that anyone would hate and they don&rsquo;t understand the most simple concepts of navigating society.  Most striking is how lonely they become in America&rsquo;s anonymous society as most people are not interested in befriending these incomprehending babes in the woods.  </p>
<p>On top of it all their relatives back in the Kenyan refugee camp keep bugging them for their share of the loot while they can barely make the rent &amp; car payments.</p>

			<p>A clever military strategist and propagandist could saturate rumors throughout Africa that Mexico was the promised land; they love blacks; and gold coins can be found on the streets, because high paying positions are so numerous, and many Africans would find a way to migrate there in great numbers.</p>
<p>What a payback that would be for saturating our country with crime and poverty.</p>

<p>Some seriously messed up immigration laws they have there in Europe where all you have to do is not talk and you can&rsquo;t be deported. I&rsquo;d say just lock them up forever until they fess up but I am sure the &#8220;human rights&#8221; people woudn&rsquo;t allow that..</p>

			<p>Can Africa actually feed its millions?  How many would simply die if they didn&rsquo;t receive Western food aid?  Maybe the best thing we could do is pay the women to be sterilized after one kid, and then move all these sterile women to colonies where useless African men weren&rsquo;t allowed.  How many of them would jump at the chance to raise their one kid in peace, knowing that they wouldn&rsquo;t starve or be slaves to layabout men or be sodomized by &#8220;soldiers&#8221;?  An African version of China&rsquo;s One Child policy.</p>

			<p>I wonder why illegal immigrants are taken to mainland Spain instead of just being kept on the Canary Islands. Don&rsquo;t they realize it will mean more Africans in mainland Europe? Sounds to me like Spain would be better off in the long run if they just to cede the Canary Islands to Morocco and concentrate on patrolling the Straight of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>This hits on one of the primary differences between Europe and America.  Both preach multiculturalism, but Europeans for the most part have enough national and ethnic pride to not consort with foreigners.  </p>

<p>It is.  When I was in Africa,  I remember being asked (and more than once) - with obviously great interest - if a black man  could obtain a white wife in America.  I replied that it is not unknown. Then I turned the question around and asked whether a white man could get a black wife in Africa.  That removed the smiles from their faces and changed their whole tone. Clearly, they didn&rsquo;t care for that idea very much. (This was a male crowd.)</p>
<p> [Incidentally, they were also very curious to know how much a white American woman would cost.  When I replied that we pay &#8220;nothing&#8221; for a wife, they were baffled. Then one of them, apparently the cleverest, explained to the others that Americans are SO rich that money means nothing to us.  That  explanation seemed to satisfy them.]</p>

<p>No.  It&rsquo;s high time they should stop looking to government to do everything for them. Government is not the answer.   That&rsquo;s the Marxist solution.  Their government is often their worst problem.   They need to learn to start doing things for themselves; that&rsquo;s the real key to self-improvement.</p>

			<p>&#8220;That clearly shows that no white woman find blacks attractive without media support. I also personally don&rsquo;t know any white woman who likes blacks.&#8221;<br>

<p>I agree about the media support. That&rsquo;s a very important element. It&rsquo;s nearly always there.  </p>
<p>As for the others, I personally have known two or three.  But with them, as I could see,  marriage was an ideological commitment. I don&rsquo;t think any of them were about love.  One was a Quaker, and another was a Marxist of some sort.  Both were very nice women, very idealistic, self-sacrificing. Perhaps more than a little masochistic.  They had married blacks, but whether they actually found them &#8220;attractive&#8221; I don&rsquo;t know.  Both marriages were unhappy, were destroying them, and I suspect it was more of a sacrifice on their part, than anything else. The &#8220;cause&#8221; came first, before their own personal happiness.<br>

			<p>A clever military strategist and propagandist could saturate rumors throughout Africa that Mexico was the promised land; they love blacks; and gold coins can be found on the streets, because high paying positions are so numerous, and many Africans would find a way to migrate there in great numbers.<br>
What a payback that would be for saturating our country with crime and poverty.<br>

<p>And let them know that Mexico is full of hot-blooded Latin senoritas who are just wild about black men.  That should do it!</p>

			<p>Most 3rd would migrants into white countries are male. They are after two things: money and white girls. They usually get them, one way or another.</p>

<p>So have some pride in our race and stop supporting the cultural brainwashing of our people.  Don&rsquo;t go to movies that pair black action heroes with white women. Don&rsquo;t watch TV shows that glorify race mixing.  This won&rsquo;t stop it but it is immoral and stupid to participate in the destruction of our race by helping the social engineers and race traitors make a profit.  Turn off Rescue Me, The Untouchables, Law and Order and all those other shows. Break off relations with ultra-liberal friends and family.  Ostracize those who contemplate our destruction. Tell them why you are cutting off relations so they will have no doubt that not all of us share their dreams.  Spend some time doing something healthy like working on your garden or teaching your children to shoot.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I came in search of happiness,&rdquo; said Ba, 28, in a cafe in Paris last week. &ldquo;I found solitude and depression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Read as:  I came here looking for lots of hand outs, but now I have to actually work.</p>

			<p>Enough, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. Unfortunately by the time you eliminate all of the entertainment that promotes race mixing, negative stereotypes of white men (in particular white Christian men) - you wont have anything to watch other than the occasional cooking show. </p>
<p>I gave up the TV a couple years ago. I got tired of the negative messages. I still allow a little bit for the kids, but screen what the kids watch, and have become known as &#8220;Mr. No&#8221; because of what I block. I do allow in the occasional DVD, but the TV viewing is down to less than 1-2 hours a day for the kids. Maybe 1-2 hours a month for me, unless I am investigating a show the kids might be interested in. </p>
<p>It has some interesting side effects. They don&rsquo;t ask for as many presents and toys. Other than Wii games, there really isn&rsquo;t the same demand as before I blacked out the TV. </p>
<p>Its only hell for the first month to do it. The kids adapt fairly quickly, and you slowly start finding other things to do with those hours that were previously wasted.  <br>

<p>There were white women sleeping with black males, including slaves, as far back as the 17th century.  Virginia and Maryland passed laws specifically punishing white women who bore children by blacks.</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;The REAL barriers to black advancement are low group IQ, impulsiveness and lack of restraint, an inability to plan ahead &hellip;.<br>
And, there is plenty of hard, non-refutable evidence based on decades of study (including the IQ tests the military has been using for 90 years which clearly show an intractable black/White gap). <br>
Why do you suppose the military still uses IQ tests?&#8221;</i></p>
<p><br>
Frankly, I&rsquo;m rather surprised that they still do.  It may be  just a matter of time before this comes to the attention of Obama and he abolishes them as biased and &#8220;racisss.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Ba is terribly unhappy, and recommends that others in Africa NOT follow in his footsteps, but is Ba going back to Africa and abandoning Europe forever?  Doesn&rsquo;t sound like it.</p>
<p>I was surprised that he was so open about wanting a blonde, white wife and mixed-race children.  I wonder if he talks about this desire with white people in Europe, and what sort of reaction he gets over there.</p>

<p>That would never work. Mexico would keep them out by any means necessary and would deport any right away. Unlike Americans, Meixcans would look out for their own country.</p>

			<p> still think that Europeans and whites have so much more, and they would &ldquo;move&rdquo; because they want some of that prosperity.</p>

<p>To bad that&rsquo;s not still true, there would be a lot of women being punished around September this year.</p>

<p>Mexico would treat the Africans the way Mexico treats the Guatemaleans.  Beat them up, rob them rape the women and send them back.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I came in search of happiness&#8221;,,,</p>
<p>Translation. Free unearned handouts, accommodation and welfare.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fantasized about ravishing blonde who would give me mixed-race children&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Translation. I prefer White women because they are more attractive then blacks and I wanted to improve the gene pool of my descendents by miscengenation.</p>

			<p>God forbid you&rsquo;d have to sweep the streets or wash dishes!  Where exactly did Mr. Ba think he&rsquo;d start? Department head or chief executive? Having a job is in itself something to take pride in.  There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with humble work; I&rsquo;ve done many humble jobs and somehow have managed to be promoted to higher positions.</p>
