			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Murray Wardrop, Telegraph (London), May 25, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Around 500 demonstrators marched through Luton, Beds, on Sunday waving banners bearing slogans such as &#8220;No Sharia Law in the UK&#8221; and &#8220;Respect our Troops&#8221;.</p>
<p>The crowd, which had gathered for a peaceful protest against Muslims who denounced troops returning from Iraq in March, was supposed to be escorted by police along a planned route.</p>
<p>But officers ended up fighting running battles with protesters after the some of mob bolted and began attacking Asian residents.</p>
<p>Police drafted in cavalry, dog handlers and riot officers at 5pm in an attempt to control the crowd, some of whom wore balaclavas and shirts bearing St George&rsquo;s Cross.</p>
<p>At one point the mob appeared to be charging in the direction of Bury Park, an area of Luton where many of the town&rsquo;s Asian population live.</p>
<p>The crowd convened on the steps of Luton&rsquo;s town hall, where many began chanting &#8220;terrorists out&#8221; before dispersing.</p>
<p>The march was organised by a group called United People of Luton (UPL), in protest against Muslim preachers who marred the homecoming parade of the 2nd Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment.</p>
<p>On March 10 extremists, including the activist Sayful Islam, jeered 200 soldiers and waved placards calling them &#8220;Butchers of Basra&#8221;, &#8220;murderers&#8221; and &#8220;baby-killers&#8221;.</p>
<p>It led to fury from families of soldiers and was condemned by Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Britain&rsquo;s former most senior Muslim police officer, Tarique Ghaffur.</p>
<p>UPL spokesman Wayne King, 24, who helped organise Sunday&rsquo;s march, said: &#8220;We want laws brought in to stop these preachers of hate operating here in Luton.</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided enough was enough after the soldiers got heckled as they marched through the town centre by the Muslim extremists.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Bedfordshire Police said: &#8220;Nine people are in custody for a range of offences including criminal damage and assault.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several cars were damaged in the riot and an Asian-owned business had its windows smashed.</p>
<p>A group called March for England had applied to Luton Borough Council for permission to march through the town centre but their request was turned down.</p>
<p>The council said it had become aware that a small group of people planned to go ahead with the march anyway.</p>

<p>Attacking Asian residents? The only other mention of any actions committed against Asians in this article is where it states an Asian business&rsquo;s window was smashed. Why would they even state that Asians were being attacked in this article at all? This news story is so obviously slanted against the white protesters.</p>

			<p>Its about time that the white race wakes up to the fact that we are small portion of the worlds total population and that we can longer cede our property, treasure and rights.  The longer we play the appeasement game the more we will lose and finally be subjugated.</p>

			<p>While some of the protesters looked a bit scary I did not see a riot when I saw the films of the incident. The most I saw was police in riot gear chasing people who were yelling at the Muslims. </p>

<p>Was it this year or last that the so-called &#8220;protectors of the law&#8221; <i>fled</i> when the same thing happened with Muslims?</p>
<p>Or maybe those cops were afraid that by arresting them they&rsquo;d &#8220;radicalise&#8221; the poor Muslims (who were only rioting due to racism/discrimination/the-fact-the-Isles-aren&rsquo;t-Britanostan-yet.<br>

			<p>I wonder how many of the &#8220;protesters&#8221; who were involved in this violence were actually UAF / Communist plants?</p>
<p>Nothing like a little violence to give a bad name to a good movement.</p>
<p>I hope the people of Luton will have the good sense to rise up and vote BNP en masse come June 4.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s about high time White people started fighting back. Muslims don&rsquo;t hesitate to protest and often show a lack of respect to countries they inhabit once their numbers get large enough.</p>

<p>What I take from this is that the White Brits were angry at the police for not defending Britain.</p>
<p>These people didn&rsquo;t want a police escort. In their heart and soul they wanted, they expected the police to take their side.</p>
<p>But the police have been emasculated by political correctness and hence their protection of the asians.</p>

			<p>I find it hard to believe Whites rioted.  Maybe it was a peaceful protest and the marchers were provoked.  Anything to lambaste Whites.  And if it wasn&rsquo;t, isn&rsquo;t it time White people started defending their rights?</p>

			<p>The only recourse whites have today anywhere in the world is in active, vehement protests.</p>
<p>And, unfortunately, the only thing white, self-appointed elitists respect is violence.  The reason non-whites are given so much right now, and whites have been ordered to the back of the bus, is that the disgusting white girlie men who are in charge are terrified of non-white violence.</p>
<p>If white people in general only knew how utterly terrified the shreiking effeminates were of the militias of the nineties, they would understand that government&rsquo;s brutish behavior halted immediately back then strictly because of white willingness to fight, and for no other reason.</p>
<p>&#8220;The meek shall inherit the earth.&#8221;  But only 6 feet of it.<br>

			<p>This story reminds me of the Riots that took place in the late 1970s and early &rsquo;80s. Riots between White Britons, and the Asian, and Black invaders of England, had gone on for days, and in some cases, weeks at a time. </p>
<p>Obviously, the only way the Whites have of getting the attention of the Traitors in our midsts, is to riot, since they are never heard by writing letters to their Representatives, coverage of their needs by the Media, or by the Courts, that continually side and coddle the non-White invaders.</p>
<p>More and more of these demonstrations will take place across Europe, now that the scale as tipped so far to the Left. What happens because of it, is the the boot-licking Politicians&rsquo; own fault. </p>
<p>Now, to get the BNP, and other Nationalist Parties in Office, across Europe. </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s good to see whites standing up for themselves.  I hope we see more of this in the future.</p>
<p>Notice at the end of the article where it said the original march for Britain was denied the right to protest?  The fact that the British government would allow Moslims the right to protest, yet refuse their own citizens is proof enough that the government is against white people.  Think about that if you&rsquo;re ever faced with the choice of aiding your benevolent government.   </p>

			<p>14th May 2009  AN ISLAMIC extremist who hurled abuse at Britain&rsquo;s home-coming troops has been beaten up by fellow Muslims.  Sayful Islam was set upon by moderates who say his controversial beliefs are making their lives hell. Their mosque was firebombed after he led the now notorious protest against the 2nd Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment&rsquo;s homecoming parade in Luton in March.  Islam – former leader of the local branch of extreme Islamic group Al-Muhajiroun – told how he &ldquo;felt elated&rsquo;&rsquo; at the sight of terrorists steering two passenger jets into the Twin Towers in New York on 9/11.</p>
<p>But moderate Muslims claim the 29-year-old&rsquo;s doctrine of hatred has led to them being shunned and want him driven out of town. Since the Islamic Education Centre was burned down they have been left with nowhere to pray. One eyewitness said: &ldquo;It was a falling-out between people who used to be friends. &ldquo;The group did not like the fact his actions have caused them problems. They are now being treated as outsiders and extremists. &ldquo;Their place of worship has been firebombed. Luton has become a difficult place to be a Muslim thanks to Sayful.&rdquo;  He added: &ldquo;These people are not extremists and do not share his beliefs. They believe they are suffering unnecessarily because of his actions.  &ldquo;Punches were thrown and Sayful legged it. He will be looking over his shoulder from now on.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>One Muslim posted on an Islamic website: &ldquo;He got bust up. Wherever they go they&rsquo;d best watch out.&rsquo;&rsquo;  One former worshipper at the bombed mosque said: &ldquo;There has been some trouble. He was not badly hurt but he has not been seen since.  &ldquo;Feelings are running high. The majority of people who attended the centre are not extreme in any way. They are peace-loving members of the community.&rdquo;  Islam was unavailable for comment last night.</p>

			<p>It;s good that these people are aware of the fact that sharia law really is a threat to them.  Look at the Netherlands. I mean they,just like us in the US, really do have people in power working very hard to change in UK into something like the Netherlands.  It&rsquo;s like something out of a strange science fiction movie.  </p>

			<p>Due to the onslaught of Britain&rsquo;s wretched New Labour government on the indigenous working-class, (most particularly Labour&rsquo;s imbecillic &#8216;open-door&rsquo; immigration policy - that has left Britain with the most massive uncontrolled influx of migrants in its history - and a subsequent huge increase in native unemployment and wage stagnation), but including other &#8216;nasties&rsquo; such as the worst economic depression in 80 years, a totalitarian police state, cripplingly high taxes,a notoriously corrupt and venal political class that stuffs itself with cash as the nation starves,  chronic housing shortages, a horrific rate of violent crime - and to cap it all random acts of muslim terrorism and news of thwarted, wide-scale mass murder planned by muslims (ironically New Labour&rsquo;s pets until tomfool Blair decided to fight muslims in Iraq) - a widescale sense of profound dissatisfaction with New Labour in particular and politics in general has emerged.Thankfully this has been parlayed into possible BNP success at the up-coming Euro-elections, fuelled by working-class anger.<br>
  However, as far as the demos in Luton are concerned, it is possible that we are seeing the stirring and awakening of a great beast - the wrath of the Anglo-Saxon.Being pushed, humiliated, violated and marginalised in their own nation for too long, the worm has turned - with all the possible Powellite implications.<br>
  The action of the New Labour elite will be to crush any mass White anger with uttmost brutality and no mercy.Expect to see paramilitaries firing live rounds - to kill - if nationalists &#8216;get out of hand&rsquo;.<br>
 A strong mental image comes to mind - that of Labour&rsquo;s Harriett Harman crouching down on all fours and lapping like a dog from a pool of spilled blood from a martyred White youth, in orerd to gain vampiric energy.</p>

			<p>British psychiatrist Anthony Daniels(Theodore Darlymple) predicted a few weeks back that England would be the first nation to implode into racial conflict. I think he is right. It&rsquo;s a small place. Different tribes in conflict for the scarce resorces of the nation.</p>
<p>If England implodes into racial conflict, you can be dam sure that it will happen it happen in a fw other European Nations and eventually the whole of Western Europe.</p>
<p>When this happens, you can predict what the elites in the US will say:&#8221;it will never happen here because we are different. We welcome diversity. It is a blessing&#8221;</p>
<p>I was watching the history channel recently. The show was about future catastrophes. An expert on this subject matter from Columbia University said that when catastrophes happen, with no exceptions, people retreat into their tribal identities and kill each other over access to the scarce resources  in a area where the these tribes cohabit. This show has been repeated several times.</p>
<p>The passage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act has set America on course for a hellish dystopia.</p>

<p>Of course!! his actions brought attention to them before they were ready to make their moves to overthrow the government. And about my previous comment about many police being muslims&hellip;Too, remember that the British term &#8220;asian&#8221; and the U.S. term is NOT THE SAME. The Brits call Pakis, Indians, Sri Lankans, Bangers and such Asian and most of those are in fact, muslims.</p>

<p>Unsound logic, my little Chinese friend.  Just because non-whites very sparsely inhabited the US area, Canada, and Australia, is no reason they should be able to lay claim to every square inch of territory.  That would include, incidentally, Rhodesia and South Africa.</p>
<p>We developed those lands and built thriving, advanced civilizations filled with advanced technology, when China and the rest of the third world were plowing their fields with oxen.  Incidentally, China is STILL a third world country.</p>

<p>Can tell us why Native Born White Americans should be in favor of the continuation of post-1965 immigration policy? Can you explain to Native Born White Americans  how the passage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act has been a great benefit to Native Born White Americans?</p>
<p>On a more fundamental level, how is being race-replaced in the interests of Native Born White Americans?</p>

			<p>This is following the pattern I&rsquo;ve been talking about here and elsewhere since 2006.</p>
<p>A period of decoding and diagnosis will precede a period of action.  This is a big plus. <br>
It means that those acting will be well-informed* and their actions more purposeful and directed.</p>
<p>*They already are well-motivated, and for obvious reasons - NO racial group in the last one hundred years has been more put upon, lied to, and scapegoated, than underpriviledged Whites - bar none.</p>
<p>Also, the most important result of the decoding is that we no longer are hypnotized by the usual accusations, which are many and everyone here knows them.<br>
And that is disempowering The Leviathan because that was one of their most important weapons.</p>
<p>In short, we are taking the power back!  It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>

<p><i>Posted by John Liu at 7:35 AM on May 27</i></p>
<p>Fairness would be giving it back to the Indians, you mean?  I don&rsquo;t recall any Asians, Africans, or Abos living in N. America prior to colonization.</p>
<p>People have the right to inhabit a land their ancestors conquered and civilized (beginning) almost 400 years ago, a land previously and sparsely occupied by barbarous tribes.  Indians also have a right to occupy it, obviously, but their numbers justify Delaware, not the entirety of the U.S.</p>
<p>Europeans (1) have right to Europe, America (2), and anywhere else they&rsquo;ve civilized over generations.</p>
<p>(1) Especially founder stocks.<br>
(2) Indians have indigenous rights in America, and the descendants of the transatlantic trade have rights too depending on how the issue is hashed out.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest; if Europeans hadn&rsquo;t conquered America, someone else would have, <i>if the world was fortunate</i> - it&rsquo;s not like humanity would be in better shape if they hadn&rsquo;t.  Quite the opposite.</p>

			<p><i>Just because non-whites very sparsely inhabited the US area, Canada, and Australia, is no reason they should be able to lay claim to every square inch of territory.</i></p>
<p>These territories were not so sparsely inhabitated as you would have us believe. But that is irrelevant anyway. China should then take back half of Russia. The point is the Native Americans liked their land sparse, and in fact great open spaces and sparse terrains help form and develop their culture, way of life, and folkways. Whites by making the lands not sparse - destroyed the way of life of the original inhabitants.</p>
<p><i>As ranger said, why don&rsquo;t you stay in your country? Why are the Chinese flooding Europe, America, Canada and even Africa?</i></p>
<p>For same reasons whites flooded the world and left their countries not too long ago. For the same reason whites invaded China, India, and Africa, and subjected those places to gross exploitation not too long ago (although Chinese do not exploit whites now, nor would they wish to do so).</p>
<p>There are more Irish derived, English derived, German derived, people not living in Ireland, England, and Germany respectively than there are in.</p>
<p>There are about 40 million Italian derived people not in Italy - and similar things could be said for other white nationalities.</p>
<p>The biggest invaders, immigrants into other peoples lands have been white. </p>
<p>There are less overseas Chinese than there are overseas Italians. </p>
<p>So whites don&rsquo;t really have a moral leg to stand on when it comes to moralizing about non-whites coming in and flooding them out.</p>
<p><i>Here in Germany, a Chinese car &ldquo;Brilliance&rdquo; scored 0 stars in the crashtest, not even a single one but 0!</i><br>
Don&rsquo;t worry, we are doing OK selling our stuff to the West. Korean and Japanese cars are OK - China will also get there soon.</p>
<p><i>We developed those lands and built thriving, advanced civilizations filled with advanced technology, when China and the rest of the third world were plowing their fields with oxen.</i></p>
<p>Only a hundred or so years ago, way of life in China was not too different from that of the US (although wars made things difficult - but that is another issue - and most of those wars were stirred up by white people anyway). </p>
<p>Whites have had it good relative to the rest of the world these past 60 or 70 years only. That&rsquo;s when the fruits of exploiting all the non-whites in the world really were brought home and shared with the average white working man. </p>
<p>Now we non-whites, simply want a share of the wealth created off the backs of non-whites (although whites made their contribution as well - I really believe that - truly).</p>

<p>Why should the determination of who should be an American up to anything or anyone other than American citizens? Why does America have some unique responsibility, not shared by other nations, to admit non-whites?

     There it is, the actual 3rd World vision of America.

<p>This is the typical guilt trip non-Whites always try to put on Whites. The truth is, look back in the distant history and bad behavior took place all over the globe EVERYWHERE. Whites have no more reason to feel guilty than non-Whites.  Only American Indians and Whites WHO ARE CITIZENS of the USA/Canada have a right to live in North America in those countries and only Aborigines and White Australian CITIZENS have a right to live in Australia PERIOD!!! Nobody else has the right too live in North America/Australia and it&rsquo;s nobody elses business both those of the CITIZENS living there.</p>

			<p>To John Liu, regarding your May 28, 2009 post, there are many White Americans that speak more than one language. My wife is fluent in Italian, while my Cousin not only speaks, but Teaches  Spanish, Italian, French, German, and Latin. </p>
<p>It is one thing to learn a second or third language to better understand the Culture of another Country for Social and Business purposes, or to better undertand your own family&rsquo;s History and traditions. </p>
<p>But a second language should not be forced on the Native population of a Country, as Latin American Spanish has been shoved onto White America, to better serve these new arrivals.</p>
<p>No, it is well past the time that the new &#8220;Immigrants&#8221; learn English to conduct themselves in public, or transact business with Government Agencies, and Services. </p>
<p>We Native-born Americans are tired of reading our Telephone bills, Tax bills, and other Official documents in a host of different languages, as well as pushing #1 for English, on the Telephone, to speak to a Representative of a Company.</p>

			<p>This started off as a really positive thread about whites finally showing some backbone, and John Liu is ruining it by yet again working out his racial issues on Amren. Why would a Chinese man spend so much time at Amren? He is an interloper both in North America and an Amren. I suggest ignoring him and refocussing on the unprecedented fact that whites in one of the most Anti-white nations in the World rose up and risked the wrath of the police to defend their culture. It is sad that John keeps e-mailing this site, but hopefully on day even he will not be tragic enough to keep up the campaign from China. Go home, John. If you don not wish to live around your people then why should I?</p>

<p>No whites did have to do the work of invading, rapine, and hauling the goodies back to the West.</p>
<p><i>This country built by Whites is somehow the property of the whole world</i><br>
Sorry but it is. Whites invaded the world, shifted population groups around like pieces on a chessboard, and now bemoan the fact that they have to look at non-white people in their neighbourhoods. Just ludicrous!</p>
<p><i>Oh, and Liu, does fairness mean we review the history of every bit of land to find its rightful owner? Or does it just mean Europeans giving up half of what they have for no good reason?</i>?</p>
<p>All peoples have carried out invasions of other peoples. But Japanese mostly live in Japan, Mongols in Mongolia, Chinese in China, Nigerians in Nigeria, and Innuit in Canada.</p>
<p>On a macro-scale it has only been the white race which has replaced other races with themselves. Virtually no other race has done. Even in Tibet (who are racially similar to Chinese anyway), 80 percent of the population are Tibetan). But the indigenous populations of the US and Australia are about 2 percent for both these places, and that 2 percent consists of people who merely identify as indigenous, maybe 1/4 indigenous or even less.  </p>
<p>Whites have been the most savage and efficient ethnic cleansers in all of human history.</p>
<p>Now they are just getting a tiny weeny taste of their own bitter medicine - and they do not like it one little bit.</p>
<p>But they are lucky - most non-whites bear little ill-will to whites. So whites will fare better under the future non-white, especially Chinese hegemony, than non-whites fared under whites during the period of colonial expansion.</p>

         You might or might not have heard of something called the &#8216;Right of Conquest&rsquo;.<br>
  This principe has been universally accepted since the beginning of recorded history - and probably the beginning of unrecorded history.<br>
 Namely, the principle legitimizes rulership of a nation if the saiod nation was defeated by force of arms - no you can&rsquo;t go running to mommy and say that&rsquo;s &#8216;unfair&rsquo; - &#8216;and take that nasty man with his big stick away from me&rsquo;.<br>
  The history of England, for exampe is a litany of one alien conquest after another, Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, Normans etc.<br>
   India too was invaded and conquered many times by Aryans,Greeks, Persians, Mongolians,Turks Arabs, British etc.<br>
  The &#8216;right of conquest&rsquo; is fully legitmized by historical precedent and thefailure of the indigenous to actually fight back effectively (which seems to be the case in the modern White world).<br>
 Likewise if the indigenous are able to rebel, win and throw off the yoke of the foreign invader, that too is legitimate and recognised.</p>

         You are probably exercised by the historic facts of the late 19th century, in which China was &#8216;raped&rsquo; by several European powers (most notably Britain)and iondeed what happened was brutal, BUT was &#8216;acceptable&rsquo; by the hisdtoric standards apertaining at that time.<br>
  But the otherside of the coin is that at that time China was ruled by a rather horrible,incompetent, plutocratic and oppressive ruling class that only cared for itself - and couldn&rsquo;t give a damn if the average Chinese peasant (there were millions and millions of them), starved to death.<br>
  I&rsquo;m not saying that this justified foreign aggression, but the fall of the old Chinese ruling class must be considered a bonus by all thinking people.<br>
  Also contrast Chinawith Japan during the mid 19th century,Both states were at a similar level of development, and both shut out foreigners.But when the Japanese realised that this position was untenable, they rapidly industrialised, refoirmed their government and army and by 1900 managed to beat the White man at his own game.Meanwhile the Chinese ruling class wereestill stuck in its old way, trying to run Chinais a mediaeval feudal state, in its own selfiush interest.</p>

<p>Yet you have no problem helping yourself to the fruits of what you pretend to believe is &#8220;invasion, rapine,&#8221; and other bad things. If the whole European enterprise in the Western hemisphere is so loathsome, wouldn&rsquo;t the honest thing to do be avoiding it altogether? Yet non-whites have no qualms about pouring into the West after the heavy lifting necessary to create a civilizatin has been done and a dysgenic, anti-white welfare state has been created by mean old Whitey. Sheer hypocrisy.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; bemoan the fact that they have to look at non-white people in their neighbourhoods &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Why ought whites to have no say over who invades their neighborhoods? Excluding  aliens (which, in today&rsquo;s America, means virtually all aliens) is something every non-white nation is wholly uncontroversial in every non-white nation on earth.</p>

			<p>The only genuine unfairness inflicted on China was the opium war, Liu.  It should be understood that there were several reasons for this, mainly mistakes made by the Chinese rulers.</p>
<p>Britain actually wanted to trade manufactured goods for Chinese products (mostly tea), but the Chinese government refused to allow them to be imported.  What they would accept instead was silver, as the Chinese economy was chronically under-moneyed at the time.  Unfortunately, this balance of specie payments was unacceptable to Britain, so they quickly found something that Chinese would buy - WHATEVER their government said about it: opium.</p>
<p>Reading about the situation, one can only feel pity for Commissioner Lin, who was trapped in an absolutely impossible situation.  The British, however were not forcing Chinese to smoke opium, any more than today&rsquo;s narcotraffickers force American druggies to use their products.  Fundamentally, it is the drug users&rsquo; fault these problems exist, and they are ultimately the ones driving the violence associated with the trade.</p>

			<p>re John Liu-&#8220;So to the Chinese, Australia is virtually empty. The Chinese should invade Australia, bring its population up to match that of China&rsquo;s and then say, the number of whites originally here would justify only the island of Tasmania being retained for them.&#8221; </p>
<p>Australia today is a formal country. At the time Whites first came, there was no country, just unsettled land. However, if you look at the history of the world, non-Whites everywhere  in the past invaded other non-Whites, fought against them and were no different whatsoever than Whites. . So according to your logic John Liu, there should be no borders. China and Korea must allow all non-Whites into their countries, correct? </p>
<p>&#8220;Whites have been the most savage and efficient ethnic cleansers in all of human history&#8221;</p>
<p>You obviously don&rsquo;t know your history John Liu. Let&rsquo;s see, millions of Chinese killed during the revolution, the &#8220;killing fields&#8221; of Cambodia, African tribes that killed and ATE their enemies, Rwanda massacre, the Rape of Nanking, the Muslim slave trade and Muslims conquestors that killed, raped and massacred amny. Major Latin American brutality and war against  other non-whites. American Indian brutality and war against other tribes. This is just the tip of the iceberg. As has been said, non-Whites were warlike and often far more brutal and agressive than Whites in past history and fought just as much if not more with other non-Whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Case closed.&#8221;</p>
<p>True, non-Whites have their own countries and have no right to go to another country. Most of the land and resources around the world is in the hands of non-Whites, not Whites. Anyway, it&rsquo;s not about land or geography, it&rsquo;s about people. White lands are more sucessful because Whites make them that way. If White nations are flooded with non-Whites, than they will become non-White and just like non-White countries and sink because non-Whites wouldn&rsquo;t have to leave their countries if they were capable of running them.</p>

<p>Nonsense. Today&rsquo;s West has no &#8220;goodies&#8221; from other countries. Most of the goodies today are not owned by Whites.</p>

<p>You need to understand that China is for all races, not just Chinese ones. When I say all races, I mean mass immigration of other races, not just a few. Until this happens, don&rsquo;t dare tell America what is should be. You are not a US citizen so it is absoulutely none of your business about what you think America should be, that&rsquo;s up to the majority of the American people, who are mostly White.</p>
