<h1><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=7561561&amp;page=1">Texting Trolley Driver Could Face Charges</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michelle McPhee, ABC News, May 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Boston-area transit authority trolley driver who allegedly slammed into another train while text-messaging his girlfriend Friday had three speeding tickets on his driving record in recent years and could face criminal charges.</p>
<p>Aiden Quinn, 24, received the three speeding tickets in his private vehicle, two in New Hampshire in April 2007, and one in Massachusetts in 2002, sources told ABC News.</p>
<p>Quinn, who was hired as a minority because of his transgendered &#8220;female-to-male&#8221; status, was born Georgia Quinn and boasts on an Internet networking site that he was one of the first transgender hires by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, sources said.</p>
<p>The trolley driver lists his sexual orientation as &#8220;FTM&#8221; and was hired as a minority using his transgender status, two sources told ABC News.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Quinn] was initially hired as a minority and used her transgender status,&#8221; an MBTA source said today.</p>
<p>MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo told ABC News today that there was &#8220;nothing unusual&#8221; about Quinn&rsquo;s hire, and that he was picked out of a lottery that he entered in 2004.</p>
<p>The Green Line trolley Quinn was driving rear-ended another trolley that was stopped between two underground stations in downtown Boston on Friday night, injuring 46 people, and he told police he was texting at the time of the crash, officials said.</p>
<p>Three of four trolley cars were crushed and MBTA officials estimated the cost of damages from the crash at $9.6 million.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Quinn could face criminal charges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the head of the Boston-area transit authority said Saturday he&rsquo;ll ban all train and bus operators from even carrying cell phones.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If it turns out to be true that Quinn was texting his girlfriend at the time of the crash, he would be at least the 10th driver guilty of the offense in the last year.</p>
<p>At least nine other bus and trolley drivers have been suspended in the last yearfor texting or talking on their cell phones while driving.<br>

		<p>BTW-In California auto insurance costs much higher for anybody under the age of 25.That said;<br>
What about hiring mature responsible adults?<br>
I remember the day when I was younger and you walked into a Sears<br>
or any store really, and an adult waited on you.<br>
There are a lot of &#8216;kids&rsquo; [by that I mean adults that aren&rsquo;t yet mature nor responsible] holding jobs where they have other people&rsquo;s lives in their hands. The transit company should be sued<br>
for not having a responsible person in that position. Heck the supervisors probably text all day too.</p>

		<p>Another affirmative action tragedy.</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The train driver blamed for the worst U.S. train crash in 15 years was sending and receiving text messages seconds before his crowded commuter train skipped a red light and collided head-on with a freight train, federal investigators said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Metrolink commuter train plowed into a Union Pacific freight locomotive on September 12 in Chatsworth, California, killing 25 people and injuring 135 in the worst train accident since 1993.</p>
<p>A National Transportation Safety Board probe has focused on whether the engineer, identified as Robert Martin Sanchez, 46, failed to heed trackside signals. Sanchez was killed in the crash.</p>
<p>Cell phone records show Sanchez was sent a text message at 4:22:01 p.m., and received one at 4:21:03 p.m. The accident occurred at 4:22:23 p.m., according to Union Pacific train&rsquo;s onboard recorders.</p>
<p>He received seven and sent five text messages between 3:00 p.m. and the time of the accident.</p>
<p>Sanchez also received 21 text messages and sent 24 while he ran a train from 6:44 a.m. to 8:53 a.m.<br>

		<p>There are two problems here, neither of which has anything to do with being &#8220;transgendered&#8221;.  1) No one should be hired because they are a minority - they should be qualified for the job regardless of race, sex or whether they have had assorted body parts rearranged.  2) texting, speaking on a cell phone or any other distraction should be illegal while driving a public conveyance.</p>

		<p>The first reaction of Boston transit authorities was to ban cell phone use among operators.  Good as far as it goes, but there is not one consideration given to tabling affirmative action.  Not when you have an affirmative action governor.</p>

		<p>When you hire people for the wrong reasons you get bad results. Imagine you are undergoing life-risking surgery and the doctor got his position based solely on his race, gender or trans-gender and not ability or intelligence. No thanks.</p>

<p>It should be illegal no matter WHAT sort of vehicle you are driving. Riding a motorcycle as my chosen main form of transport, I (we motorcyclists) see sooooooo many things that escape the notice of other car/truck drivers, DANGEROUS THINGS!!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t get why this article was posted here. Because this was affirmative action? It wasn&rsquo;t. This individual was not hired over any more qualified people because of his minority status and his minority status had nothing to do with the accident.</p>
<p>There are no quotas for transgendered people. I just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s unfair to forbid everyone to carry a cell phone because of this strange specimen. But that&rsquo;s what liberals do. Unwilling to make people take responsibility for their actions, they  pass laws about OBJECTS (phones, cars, seatbelts, guns)<br>
The OBJECT is not responsible for the action. A HUMAN is.<br>

		<p>Why are white folks virtually banned from having jobs like these? White folks, particularly men, like driving stuff. A big bus or something must provide particular joy. Can&rsquo;t have that, I guess.</p>

		<p>A bit off topic, but I agree with SKIP; as a motorcyclist, I&rsquo;ve found that I can often predict which drivers are talking on their phones as I come up behind them due to their driving patterns.  I think that all serious accidents should result in a check on cellphone records of the involved parties.</p>

		<p>If you cause an accident because you were on the phone, you should be cited for inattentiveness or whatever.  Not specifically because you were yapping on the phone or playing with the radio  &mdash;  but because you weren&rsquo;t paying attention.</p>
<p>My husband had a second cousin who was killed in a head-on crash on a two-lane road because she was messing with the radio.  It was her car versus I think a semi.</p>

		<p>Cellphones for operators of trolleys should be banned on duty.  They have a radio locked into the dispatch frequency if they need to talk about the job. </p>
