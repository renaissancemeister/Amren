			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Teresa Watanabe, Los Angeles Times, May 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 1 million immigrants became U.S. citizens last year, the largest surge in history, hastening the ethnic transformation of California&rsquo;s political landscape with more Latinos and Asians now eligible to vote.</p>
<p>Leading the wave, California&rsquo;s 300,000 new citizens accounted for nearly one-third of the nation&rsquo;s total and represented a near-doubling over 2006, according to a recent report by the U.S. Office of Immigration Statistics. Florida recorded the second-largest group of new citizens, and Texas claimed the fastest growth.</p>
<p>Mexicans, who have traditionally registered low rates of naturalization, represented the largest group, with nearly one-fourth of the total. They were followed by Indians, Filipinos, Chinese, Cubans and Vietnamese.</p>
<p>The new citizens are reshaping California&rsquo;s electorate and are likely to reorder the state&rsquo;s policy priorities, some political analysts predict. Several polls show that Latinos and Asians are more supportive than whites of public investments and broad services, even if they require higher taxes.</p>
<p>Most Latinos, for instance, support all five budget propositions on the May ballot while most whites oppose them, according to recent polls by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. Although viewed as largely conservative, most Asian Americans supported a 2004 measure requiring large businesses to provide health insurance to employees, even as it failed at the ballot box, according to an analysis by the Asian Pacific American Legal Center in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Nationally, nonwhite voters overwhelmingly supported Barack Obama&rsquo;s presidential candidacy, while most whites voted for Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a recent study by the Pew Research Center showed. And there were more nonwhite voters last year  &mdash;  Latino registered voters increased by 3 million compared with 2004, said Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voting Registration Education Project in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The surge in new citizens will accelerate by several years the California electorate&rsquo;s shift from majority white to nonwhite, according to Dowell Myers, a USC demographer. Although that shift won&rsquo;t be completed until 2026, Myers and others said, Latinos, Asians and African Americans are already joining with progressive whites to elect ethnically diverse candidates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The path to the 1-million mark was paved by an organized collaboration among community activists, the Spanish-language media and government. Univision TV network and La Opinion newspaper, in particular, had many stories about the importance of citizenship and demystified the application process, said Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. immigration officials worked weekends to distribute information, develop TV scripts and provide an official to conduct an on-air mock citizenship interview, Vargas said. Jane Arellano, district director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services&rsquo; seven-county area covering Southern California, was the movement&rsquo;s &#8220;unsung hero,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the region&rsquo;s adult and community colleges joined the effort, expanding English and civics classes to help prepare immigrants for their citizenship test. The Los Angeles Unified School District&rsquo;s adult education division nearly doubled the number of citizenship classes last year over the previous year, officials said.</p>
<p>One of those new Latino voters was Joanuen Llamas, a 26-year-old Mexico native and Los Angeles homemaker who legally immigrated here in 1998. She was inspired to become a citizen in March 2008 after joining the massive immigrant rights marches of recent years and took to heart their slogan, &#8220;Today we march, tomorrow we vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Gonzalez said Latinos and other immigrants still had far to go, noting that 8 million of them have not yet claimed citizenship although they are eligible. &#8220;The test is going forward,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Indeed, new citizenship applications have already dropped significantly. In the Southern California district, for instance, applications plunged to 58,433 last year from 253,666 the previous year, U.S. immigration statistics show.</p>
<p>Most experts say that a 69% increase in application fees to $675 was one reason for the steep decline. The Obama administration is proposing $206 million in funding for immigration services that could help reduce the fee by about $50, and activists are hoping for more, said Rosalind Gold of the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund. New citizen Alfonso Vergara is one product of the massive citizenship campaign effort. A Mexico native and pharmaceutical technician, the 31-year-old said he had postponed applying for citizenship for years because the process seemed too time-consuming.</p>

			<p>Of course non-whites support increased public services. Whites pay and they receive. Why wouldn&rsquo;t they support such increases? Only integrity and a moral compass would prevent them from supporting such self-serving policies. Are they not aware that when whites are gone, nobody will be there to pay for these public services?</p>

			<p>The only consolation in all of this is that, while the White traitor politicians enact legislation allowing the illegals to become citizens (or to vote anyway) it is NOT THEY (the traitor politicians) who are going to be elected (re-elected) to their coveted office, it will be the 3rd worlders and the politicians will be unemployed.</p>

			<p>Most Americans seem to be either completely ignorant of what has happened or they just don&rsquo;t care!!</p>
<p>I was reading as many as 6 newspapers a day in 1965 and every editorial said that the new immigration law would be just a minor adjustment to immigration policy that would make it possible for families to be reunited and iron out a few minor inequities.  No one opposed the new law.  Senator Ted Kennedy along with others promised that the racial balance in the U.S. would not be upset (I called Sen. Kennedy&rsquo;s office several years ago and asked if he&rsquo;d like to apologize for lying to the American people, or at least being wrong in what he said.  One of his aides replied that all people are the same, so it doesn&rsquo;t make any difference).</p>
<p>Only two writers came out against the new law.  James Jackson Kilpatrick said something like &#8220;can anyone deny that the U.S. would have a different character if it were founded by a different kind of people?&#8221;  I think it was Earl or Richard Wilson who wrote in his column something like &#8220;this will mean big changes for America.  For one thing there will be fewer movie stars like Gary Cooper and Clark Gable and more like Omar Sharif.  But that is democracy and we must accept it.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Democracy?  If there were one true religion common to all Americans it was the worship of the gods and goddesses of the silver screen.  </p>
<p>James J. Kilpatrick caved in one or two columns later and said, in effect, what Wilson did:  we must accept it.</p>
<p>Anyone could see what was coming.  I could see it and so could Kilpatrick and Wilson.  But there went the U.S.A.</p>
<p>Same for Europe.  The Camp of the Saints spelled it out, but it was ignored.  All we can do now is try our best to regroup and survive.</p>

			<p>Latinos and Asians are more supportive, when it comes to higher taxes in order to get more social services, according to the article. What happens when a huge number of taxpaying whites leave the state, as they are now doing? Will Latinos and Asians prove their integrity to their ideals of higher taxation when the bill comes due  &mdash;  for them to pay it? Talk is cheap.</p>

			<p>It is unfortunate that the newcommers are not wealthy or have something special to add.  Instead all they seem to do is suck benefits and vote for their relatives to follow them.  It is sad that the media cannot seem to understand why the locals are not so excited.  </p>

			<p>I advise White residents of other states to immediately implement strict border control measures to prevent the inevitable influx of Californian liberals who will need a place to stay after the new minority masters of their state vote Whites into political and economic oblivion.  </p>
<p>Perhaps gentle encouragement to emigrate to the 3rd world paradise of their choosing would work, if you give them enough encouragement via Tasers and truncheons&hellip;</p>

			<p>The United States has been invaded,and requires a military response. We already fought and won U.S and mexican war,and the way It Is looking,we will have to do It again. Legal and Illegal Immigration are both out of control,and It Is destroying this country. Gangs,Graffiti,and lack of assimilation Into our society,which Includes SPEAKING ENGLISH,are just some of the Injustices that are being suffered by Legal American Citizens. People marching In OUR streets again waving Mexican Flags. Its going to get real nasty real soon,especially If the left wing extremists try pass the dream act,or any amnesty at all. We WILL be watching.</p>

			<p>Since all 4 of my grandparents were born in Ireland, I am eligible to become a citizen - and that&rsquo;s exactly what I am doing.  Even my spouse who, recently commented that we may have to leave the U.S. at some point down the road, is looking into citizenship in Italy where all 4 of his grandparents were born.  Hopefully, we&rsquo;ll have a choice on where to escape to.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to live in an America we no longer recognize.  We know a sinking ship when we see one.  The scary part is leaving all those nuclar weapons in the hands of a people who will never be as civilized as Europeans.<br>

			<p>It is over for the 50 United States.  It is time to negotiate a separate nation for whites.  Possibly a nation for blacks.  And a third grouping for all the diversity lovers.  And the sooner the better.  Obama, of course, secession would never allow white sesesion but if a 100 million whites stuck together it might force his hand.  The thought of foreigners determining my family&rsquo;s future is scary.</p>
<p>Better to get out while the gettings good.</p>

			<p>Looks like we need to secede and have a few White states of our own and control our OWN destiny, not allow nonwhites to decide it for us. Either that or leave the country, which I do not even for a moment advise. This is OUR country and OUR ancestors formed and built this nation from scratch for their PROGENY. For us to allow what is happening to our nation is unforgivable and it is time to take a stand and be counted.</p>

			<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see the asians and latinos fight it out in the streets. The blood will run. Sorry, I am just too bloodthirsty for my own good.<br>
   Half these immigrants would be gone if we required all government documents to be in english. They would be forced to flee back to their homelands. </p>

<p>Poorer people don&rsquo;t pay as much in taxes, so that may be true for Hispanics, but Chinese and Indian Americans are some of the most affluent ethnic groups in America. Everyone knows that.<br>
I imagine a pretty high number of people in those groups cheat on their taxes, given what things are like in the old country, but they are far from the only ones (Geithner, Daschle and the anonymous UBS clients come to mind.)</p>

			<p>Either Native Born White Americans politically organize around their lewgitmate racial interests ot they will over time become an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America&hellip;or they can continue to participate in a sports entertainment market that has made Shaq,Koby and A-Rod multimillionaires.</p>
<p>In a few years, it will be impossible to enforce immigration laws in California. The hispanics,asians,and muslims will laugh at immigration enforcement. California is going to have massive-rapid population growth. The nonwhites are already livng several families to a house. Goodby endangered species  Housing for the non-whites will be a top priority. By by Yosemenite. Who will get the marine,airforce and Naval bases in California. There will be nothing White Americans  can do about chinese and hindu technological and military spying.</p>
<p>Once the racial transformation of California is complete, the MSM media will see this as a mandate for the racial transformation of the rest of America.</p>
<p>Nothing will change unless there are major catastrophic events. The only thing White Nationalists can do is to provide a comprehensive framework so that when the catastrophic events happen,our fellow White Americans will have a well thought out framework that they can tap into.</p>

<p>Well, good luck to you!  You may be needing it.</p>
<p>You may, perhaps, get a few years of respite, but I suspect not much. White countries everywhere are under assault. White countries cannot be allowed to exist.</p>
<p>(When will whites finally wake up and learn that there is NO EXCAPE from what is planned for us?  The same agenda is going on all over the world!)</p>

			<p>The politics of genocide (of whites)this is not the politics of socialism because these race groups want strictly race based benefits.  They have no sense of duty to improve society, the reporter never mentioned anything that was not race based, but being a mommy prof. trained pet regurgitated the lies.</p>

<p>I am eligible for citizenship in Ireland also, but would not abandon my country. My grandparents immigrated here in 1948 for a better life, just as millions of Europeans did decades before them. They left Ireland behind and stayed here and raised their children to be good Americans. I will not let their hard work be all for nothing. As a second generation American, i will fight with my fellow countrymen when that time arrives. Go ahead and depart, but you will not be welcomed with open arms when you return. You will be seen as traitors and cowards.    </p>
