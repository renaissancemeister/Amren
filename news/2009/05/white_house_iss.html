<h1><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0409/21940.html">White House Issues Advisory After Obama Mexico Trip</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carol E. Lee &amp; Josh Gerstein, The Politico, April 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The White House has issued a health advisory outlining &#8220;protective measures&#8221; for anyone who traveled on President Barack Obama&rsquo;s trip to Mexico after a member of the U.S. delegation came down with flu-like symptoms  &mdash;  and tests on his family showed they&rsquo;re probably infected with the swine flu.</p>
<p>The individual  &mdash;  an advance security staffer for Energy Secretary Steven Chu  &mdash;  appears to have spread the flu to his wife, son and nephew. All three have tested probable for swine flu, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Thursday.</p>
<p>Gibbs, who did not name the security aide, said he did not work closely with Obama, didn&rsquo;t fly on Air Force One and is back at work at the Energy Department.</p>
<p>But the staffer was at a working dinner Obama attended with Mexican officials April 16. The aide &#8220;was asked specifically if he ever came within six feet of the president, and the answer to that was &#8216;No,&rsquo;&#8221; Gibbs said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gibbs said Thursday that Chu&rsquo;s aide developed a fever while in Mexico and that several of the aide&rsquo;s relatives subsequently fell ill with flu-like symptoms. The aide has not tested positive for swine flu, probably because so much time has elapsed, but tests on his three relatives came back as &#8220;probable&#8221; cases on Tuesday, Gibbs said.</p>
<p>The man flew back to Washington on a commercial United Airlines flight that landed at Dulles International Airport on April 18, Gibbs said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gibbs said a White House physician reported that about 10 staffers who traveled to Mexico visited him. But Gibbs said, &#8220;None of those people, however, came back with any positive tests.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Has anybody else but me made note of our president&rsquo;s obvious lack of intelligence in saying that it&rsquo;s too late to close the border, because we already have infected people here?</p>
<p>How can anybody be so dumb as to reason that stopping what could be a thousand plus more carriers won&rsquo;t matter, since they have the ability to spread the disease by a multiplicity facter of huge amounts?</p>
<p>Close the border ANYTIME and there will be fewer carriers here, and therefore the spread will be less to some degree.  Isn&rsquo;t having fewer sick peiople or dead people something someone who is supposed should be doing?</p>
<p>In the future, if an untreatable strain of bird flu is killing people world wide and we have 100 cases here that came up from Mexico, with thousands more planning on making the trip, is this man going to logic that there&rsquo;s no reason to close the border, because we already have 100 cases?  That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s saying about this bug, and he&rsquo;s going to be really lucky if it turns out to be mild, because, if it were deadly, millions would die for certain with wide open borders.</p>
<p>People who consider this man intelligent have suspect intellects themselves.  No intelligent person woiuld arrive at such a jevenile conclusion.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;The White House has issued a health advisory outlining &lsquo;protective measures&rsquo; for anyone who traveled on President Barack Obama&rsquo;s trip to Mexico after a member of the U.S. delegation came down with flu-like symptoms &mdash; and tests on his family showed they&rsquo;re probably infected with the swine flu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Personally, I think this swine flu hysteria by the media and political elites is a carefully orchestrated &ldquo;disaster&rdquo; of opportunity. The media in particular (and of course MSNBC worst of all) have reacted to this &ldquo;pandemic&rdquo; in the making with an almost ghoulish glee. </p>
<p>One is left wondering why?</p>
<p>I hold, that they have come to the conclusion that their &ldquo;savior,&rdquo; Comrade BO, is about to plunge this country into a socioeconomic whirlwind of unprecedented proportions. Thus, a looming &ldquo;disaster&rdquo; that he can &ldquo;prevent,&ldquo; is needed to return him to the &ldquo;deity&rdquo; status of Marx or Mao. </p>
<p>Hence, when we are all eating in soup kitchens one or two years from now, they will all bark like the mindlessly trained seals that they are, that we: &lsquo;Must remember, his divine hopefulness saved us all from the horrors of the swine flu in 2009.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

			<p>If one were to look at the big picture thouroughly, the swine flu scare will become more clear.  Remember, the Mexican drug cartels have been fighting and killing in record numbers this year.  The U.S. Military and Mexican Military (police) have been at the border ready to strike these drug lords strong and hard. The only way to reduce civilian American Casualties is to come up with something (Swine Flu Scare), and cause the people to leave the area and or not go to that area on their own free will.  Then, the Mexican and American Forces can go in and fight the Cartels without killing too many innocents.  The Swine Flu is not as serious as some folks think.  Propaganda works, always has and always will.  Just don&rsquo;t fall for it if you don&rsquo;t have to. There is a swine flu going around, but trust me, it is being played out.</p>

			<p>The borders are open to Africans with active HIV so what the heck is the difference with a little flu? I bet there is a bigger stampeed on our Southern borders very soon, looking for that free medical coverage.</p>
