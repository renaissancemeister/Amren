<h1><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D984SLN80&amp;show_article=1">Couple&rsquo;s &#8216;Buy Black&rsquo; Experiment Becomes a Movement</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Errin Haines, AP, May 12, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maggie and John Anderson of Chicago vowed four months ago that for one year, they would try to patronize only black-owned businesses. The &#8220;Empowerment Experiment&#8221; is the reason John had to suffer for hours with a stomach ache and Maggie no longer gets that brand-name lather when she washes her hair. A grocery trip is a 14-mile odyssey.</p>
<p>&#8220;We kind of enjoy the sacrifice because we get to make the point .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I am going without stuff and I am frustrated on a daily basis,&#8221; Maggie Anderson said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s like, my people have been here 400 years and we don&rsquo;t even have a Walgreens to show for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, the Andersons have spent hundreds of dollars with black businesses from grocery stores to dry cleaners. But the couple still hasn&rsquo;t found a mortgage lender, home security system vendor or toy store. Nonetheless, they&rsquo;re hoping to expand the endeavor beyond their Chicago home.</p>
<p>Plans are under way to track spending among supporters nationwide and build a national database of quality black businesses. The first affiliate chapter has been launched in Atlanta, and the couple has established a foundation to raise funds for black businesses and an annual convention.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now, the Andersons are following up with 4,000 people who signed up for the experiment on their Web site to gauge their commitment and set up online accounts to track their spending. Hundreds have also joined the experiment&rsquo;s Facebook page, Maggie Anderson said.</p>
<p>Gregory Price, chairman of the economics department at Morehouse College, said black visionaries like Booker T. Washington and Marcus Garvey made similar calls to action.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is a sound one, given that black Americans are still underrepresented in the ranks of the self-employed and that entrepreneurship is a key component to wealth,&#8221; Price said.</p>
<p>There are one million black businesses in the United States accounting for more than $100 billion in annual sales, according to the National Black Chamber of Commerce. The latest U.S. Census numbers report that blacks have more than $800 billion in expendable income each year.</p>
<p>The Andersons track their spending on their Web site and estimate about 55 percent of their monthly spending is with black businesses for things like day care, groceries, car maintenance and home improvements.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Price, the Morehouse professor, said defining the project&rsquo;s success won&rsquo;t be easy, since the real barriers to black advancement are poor access to capital and lack of training opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be nice to see some real, hard data,&#8221; Price said. &#8220;Otherwise, it could just be an episode of ethnic cheerleading.&#8221;</p>

			<p>When do we get to start a buy white campaign and have the media gush over it?  Even if we could or did, there are hardly any real white businesses to buy from.  Yeah, there area lot of businesses and corporations that seem to be headed and run by white people, but you wouldn&rsquo;t know it in any other way.</p>

			<p>This is precisely the type of ultimately meaningless symbolic gesture Blacks adore&hellip;and precisely why they continue to lag so far behind the rest of covilized society! What on earth do these people really hope to achieve by this? </p>
<p>On the plus side, I applaud every act of self-segregation Blacks engage in! </p>

			<p>The idea is a sound one, given that black Americans are still underrepresented in the ranks of the self-employed and that entrepreneurship is a key component to wealth,&rdquo; Price said</p>
<p>More blacks need to embrace self employment.  People are always complaining &#8220;they&rsquo;re not putting enough jobs in our communities&#8221; &#8220;the mexicans are taking all our jobs&#8221; etc., they don&rsquo;t realise  that jobs aren&rsquo;t created by the government but by individual entreprenual citizens. We will continue to have the highest unemployment rate as the result of mostly white bosses favoring illegal aliens over ex-con citizens. Self employed blacks could hire men that society considers &#8220;unemployable&#8221;. People just don&rsquo;t want to deal with the hardship, diligence and sacrafice(give up nice clothes, jewlry, steak houses, parties, etc.) that comes from a stratup business. People prefer something already established when  all the hard work and heavy lifting needed to establish the company is already done. My family thought I was crazy when I gave up my 6 figure office city job  to become  self employed. They thought I was insane having to live without cable  and  shopping for years. </p>

			<p>Did you ever go to a store and look for the owner to see what color they are? The idea is a sound one? Here is a perfect example of racist thoughts.Didn&rsquo;t the multiculters say we are all the same.Maybe this couple should have race training to overcome their racist attitudes.If this idea is a sound one amoung blacks what does that say about them being able to get along with other people.When I was a child I remember what a black adult female told me&#8221; When we take over you are going to be my slave&#8221;.We as a people need to assert are rights or we will perish.Maybe we should only support white businesses.</p>

			<p>The Andersons, one would think, would want to be the first to exploit the paucity of black-owned businesses in their area.  Certainly, what with the set-aside capital loan funds available to them from various sources, they could start their own business of some sort, even turning away whites and Asians seeking to give them their patronage.  While this wouldn&rsquo;t be a particulary intelligent business model, they would be &#8220;making a statement,&#8221; which is all most blacks seem interested in doing.  After all, talking is always easier than doing.  Much easier.</p>

			<p>I think whites should reciprocate and support only white owned enterprises, white churches, white schools, white lawyers, and whatever else supports only the white communities interests. All non-white interests of whatever sort should be shunned, banned, and ignored. It&rsquo;s only fair!!! </p>

			<p>This has been promoted many times in the past with unsurprising results.  When Black people purchase merchandise or services they want the best for their money and many times this means spending your money with white owned businesses.</p>

			<p>  This is the epitome of racism. When you refuse to do business with any race other than your own, according to the current political climate, this is outright racism.  From this day forward, I am boycotting all Black owned businesses as a form of protest.</p>

			<p>I go along with the Andersons and the rest of their fellow &#8220;Blacks&#8221; on this one. Not only should they &#8220;buy &#8220;Black&#8221;, but they should be able to exercise the RIGHT to live among their own kind and to manage their own affairs as well. Were they to do so, the quality of life would improve not only for the other races but for theirs as well. </p>

			<p>A black couple openly practices discrimination and it&rsquo;s applauded as an &#8220;empowerment experience&#8221;. Well, maybe white business owners should choose to only do business with white people. Do they not get to choose with whom they do business?</p>

<p>Yes and whose fault is that Maggie? The US government bends over backwards to give loans to Black businesses or to Blacks who want to go college etc. Blacks have nobody to blame but themselves yet they never can admit failure. This theme always runs true with blacks.</p>

			<p>I wonder if this is a form of reverse discrimination against <br>
Whites? What would the response be if Whites were to do the <br>
same thing to black business and only support White business? <br>
This is also a form of boycotting which is I think illegal <br>
in many areas of the country.</p>

			<p>We should all be happy about this. We should encourage them to also go to all black schools,live in all black neighborhoods, work in all black businesses, eat in all black resturants&hellip;etc,etc! That would keep them away from us, and crime rates would plummet.</p>

I find this to be a pointless exercise in that nothing is created. All they&rsquo;re doing is wasting their time running around.</p>
<p>A far more productive action would be to create central black business districts that cater to the black community.</p>
<p>They should find a central location in relatively stable black community and encourage businesses to relocate, provide incentives and opportunities for black business to flourish.</p>
<p>If they want to waste time, energy, money, fuel, fine. Let them. But in the end, what will this prove or achieve? When it&rsquo;s all over, what will they have in place that will make any positive impact on creating business opportunities for blacks? There is no plan for an end game and nothing tangible.</p>
<p>As with most things blacks do, this is pointless.</p>

<p>Which is admitting that &#8220;your people&#8221; don&rsquo;t have the ability to work towards acquiring businesses even though there are millions who are overpaid and underperform who have the money to start any kind of business other races in this country have.<br>
But none have the ability to create and/or successfully manage anything as entrpreneurs.</p>
<p>Such whining and such dimwittedness, they can&rsquo;t admit even to themselves that they just can&rsquo;t cut it in an advanced society.<br>

			<p> Question Diversity asked when can we buy from only white stores?</p>
<p>  The answer sir is NOW. </p>
<p> Blacks like to make a giant spectacle of themselves and their causes. They get dressed up, scream from the highest hilltop. They march, they sing and then&hellip;&hellip;they do exactly as they did before. <br>
 <br>
Remember the &#8220;million man march&#8221;? It was to protest the then 50% illigitimacy rate. It now stands at 72% and rising.</p>
<p> They had a big do about needing 10,000 black footsoldiers to stop street violence in Philly. They got to about 200 and lost interest.</p>
<p>  They have march after march for who knows what and nothing else changes for them, Their behavior stays the same or gets worse. They like to dress up in their faux-african ceremonial robes (made in Taiwan). Give themselves stupid African names and dance around like its bonfire night in the Kalahari and two days later forget what they were fussing about.</p>
<p>  Whites however go about their business quietly and efficiently. I dont have to wear a sign saying &#8220;I buy from white businesses only&#8221; I just go to white shops and drop my cash. I dont need to get other whites to follow my lead, when they see this stupid stunt they usually know what to do.</p>
<p>  I think its a boon to white owned businesses. Let blacks go to other stores. Do you think they wont steal from black owned stores? Do you think they wont rob black owned stores. PUHLEEEZE!</p>
<p>  I think this is great. Let blacks seperate themselves from whites. Less work for us to do it ourselves. Socially isolated. Economically isolated&hellip;PERFECT!</p>
<p>  First step in a homeland for blacks. SEPARATION NOW!</p>

			<p>Diversity hogwash reveling in extreme absurdity. &#8216;Buying black&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t what is absurd &#8216;double-think&rsquo;. Calling it all an &#8216;experiment&rsquo; is where it reaches overkill. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the equivalent of saying Asian kids should experiment with be being good with math and science. Nerds should keep an open mind and give Star Trek a try. NASCAR fans should consider beer as an alcoholic beverage of choice. </p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;My people have been here 400 years and we don&rsquo;t even have a Walgreens to show for it.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t <i> even</i> have a Walgreens&hellip;&rdquo; Yes, I see her point. Walgreens is pretty much the lowest common denominator of any national chain. If an area can&rsquo;t even support a Walgreens, you know it&rsquo;s pretty hard up.</p>
<p>This is funny, because I was just talking about this very subject with someone today. I mentioned how downtown Gary, once the former boomtown of the entire region, is now a ghost town. Even the Walgreens that opened there a couple decades ago, trying to give another go of it, closed up shop a few years later. </p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s the pathetic part: the Walgreens was on the same block as the former Hotel Gary, which had been converted with federal funds to a senior citizen high-rise! Imagine&hellip;even all the elderly people a few doors down who needed a steady stream of medication were not enough to keep the Walgreens open. The person I was talking to suggested the Walgreens probably closed due to &ldquo;shrinkage,&rdquo; and I immediately realized she was right. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the bottom line: Black entrepreneurism has failed and is doomed to failure because of desegregation. Once it was decreed that blacks could live in shop anywhere, and in fact, it was seen as a badge of success to live and shop in white areas, the black business community was doomed.  as long as desegregation is the law of the land, the black infrastructure will never stand a chance competing directly against the white community, the efforts of this perhaps well-intentioned couple notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Was this perhaps why our ancestors, after hundreds of years of experience, saw segregation as the wisest option for all races? Our ancestors were a lot smarter than the fools today give them credit for.</p>

			<p>Of course, this couple has the right to spend their money as they see fit. I think a lot of white people do this, they just have an easier time with it and don&rsquo;t announce it to the world that they are buying all-white. This movement may have the positive effect of encouraging black businesses to start up, which, assuming the businesses succeed, will create more jobs, more stability and more money in the economy. A black-owned business is still a business. </p>

			<p>there were a lot of black businesses before segregation was prohibited. ever wonder what happened to them? they couldnt compete. same thing will happen this time around. discrimination doesnt work because money, quality &amp; service will always count. if a business cant survive on its own mert then it ultimately it will fail  &mdash;   unless its propped up by segregation or affirmitive action.</p>

			<p>Many have indicated that they believe this impulse to be racist. Far from it, I say. It is the most basic and sensible sort of self-love, and racial realism. We want to encourage this behaviour in blacks, Hispanics, and in our OWN RACE! As far as I am concerned, the sooner black Americans decide to shop only with their own kind, use only their own doctors, dentists, lawyers, and live only amongst themselves the better. I applaud these people, and I hope they will applaud the right for 200 million Whites to do the same thing. </p>
<p>Separation can start with the market, then the schoolhouse, then political entities. Our cultures are incompatible. One has only to look at Africa to understand this. Africans are perfectly content to live in the ruins of British colonial civilization. They are simply happy that one of their own race is running the place. They care little that it is a shambles, it is THEIR shambles. </p>
<p>I look upon this as a great day for race realists in America. This movement could help usher in greater racial awareness, and along with the Obama Presidency could swell our ranks. I hope this movement becomes a tidal wave of black consolidation. Maybe then I can walk down my suburban street without hearing hip-hop booming from a car while hooligan men stand around without work, waiting for the Section 8 baby mama to get home. Go, be fruitful and amongst your own, black people. I support your efforts to segregate yourselves economically and physically. Both of these things are your RIGHTS as Americans, right? Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty you&rsquo;re free at last&hellip;</p>

			<p>Excellent idea!  Whites should do the same, and support only white businesses.<br>
And let&rsquo;s not forget about music, movies, &amp; sports!</p>
<p>In order to do that,  we must not forget about that portion of our wealth that is confiscated by force*   by the government, which is then given to non-whites (both in America &amp; abroad!); in many cases, explicitly because they are non-white!  For this, we should only support white politicians who are faithful to whites. </p>
<p>*Oh yes, by force, and don&rsquo;t forget it!  You know what happens to those who don&rsquo;t pay up-they take your property AND your freedom.  They do not fail to threaten your very life, if you resist.   Just like the black street thugs who attack whites on foot, in their cars, and even in their own homes.  Because of all this, no white should ever patronize black-owned anything, nor should they support any further transfers of wealth to blacks in any form. </p>

<p>Yeah, and whose fault is that?  Of course, the unspoken implication of that statement is that it&rsquo;s the WHITEMAN&rsquo;s fault that blacks can&rsquo;t even run something as simple as a franchise convenience store.</p>
<p>I also find it ironic that they have a Facebook page.  After all, Facebook was created by a WHITEMAN and every visit to that site makes money for him.</p>
<p>The truth is that if an American really tried to &#8220;buy black&#8221; for a year, they&rsquo;d starve to death in darkness and squalor.  These people are just engaging in egregious cop-outs to get publicity for their explicitly anti-white racist endeavor.</p>

			<p>I try to avoid Indian-owned groceries (they overcharge, often stock is over the use-by date); I am very careful about Asian and Indian restaurants and bakeries (because Asians and Indian names abound on the Australian government name-and-shame food website); I try to avoid Indian taxi drivers (they never know the way); I tend to avoid large groups of drunken Aboriginals for obvious reasons &hellip;</p>
<p>Guess this makes me a &#8216;racist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>BTW, why have US blacks never established their own shops in their own communities? Why Korean grocery stores instead of black-owned grocery stores? </p>

			<p>I wholehaetedly agree &#8220;dc&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;The health inspectors went through my area and fined 22 restaurants, 21 of them were asian; indian, chinese, thai and korean for poor hygiene etc. Immigration Dept. went through the area&rsquo;s restaurants last year and closed 10 in 1 night. These asians are criminals and unclean, I don&rsquo;t buy from them as I am afraid of getting poisoned by their exotic treats.</p>
<p>I see plenty of asians working for white people but not the other way round. Many asians have said to me, &#8220;white man is more fair than asian man&#8221;, how true. We are so tolerant and fair that the whites are killing themselves.</p>
<p>300 people got food poisoning at a Vietnamese bakery in Sydney recently, the Inspectors found rat poo all over the bakery. Keep away from these unclean places. </p>
<p>Parts of Sydney now look like a true third world toilet; laundry hanging from the balconies, gangs on the streets, signage and window dressing in asian languages, the restaurants use the public bins as their own private rubbish tip and the smell.</p>
<p>I would like to bury Kevin Rudd&rsquo;s face into one of those bins, so he will understand what close ties with asia mean.</p>

			<p>When a black becomes a  real businessowner, and I dont mean one of the SBA loan guarantee type of businessman that fails as soon as the loan runs out,  he often changes and sees things much like we see them. I know well a black businessman who has been in the concrete laying business a long time and has a good reputation in my area. He will tell anybody who will listen that he will never hire another black employee ever again. He has several crews of 6-8 guys and they are mexican and a few white. Only blacks are himself and his brother. He used to have all blacks working for him but claims that they were lazy and would steal all his tools. When he switched employees his problems went away. He tells it like it is.   KF </p>

<p>Not to worry, soon all corporations will be run from Washington with most business to follow  &mdash;  all part of obama&rsquo;s &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change.&rsquo;  You do realize that he understands economics and how to run a business better than any of those greedy White CEOs who run them now.</p>
<p>Expect the banished CEO show trials soon  &mdash;  fully televised, of course.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;real barriers to black advancement are poor access to capital and lack of training opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8216;It would be nice to see some real, hard data&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The REAL barriers to black advancement are low group IQ, impulsiveness and lack of restraint, an inability to plan ahead for the future and the belief that government is to be used to punish Whites, extract their wealth and redistribute it to blacks (who didn&rsquo;t earn it).</p>
<p>And, there is plenty of hard, non-refutable evidence based on decades of study (including the IQ tests the military has been using for 90 years which clearly show an intractable black/White gap).   Why do you suppose the military still uses IQ tests?</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>From Professor Ruston:</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/92xlg</p>
<p>From Professor Lynn:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/pj3otc" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/pj3otc</a></p>
<p>It IS possible to buy White, even here in California.  I told my neighbors I don&rsquo;t want anyone but Whites working on my property or around my house  &mdash;  they immediately understood and now we have a running list of plumbers, gardeners, tree trimmers, cleaning services, electricians, chimney sweeps, etc. that we pass around.</p>
<p>These White-hating ethno-centric groups and their children get enough of my tax money and receive special privileges from the government as it is.  I will not add to their coffers and I suggest all Whites do likewise  &mdash;  after all, it&rsquo;s exactly what these ethno-centric groups do themselves.</p>

			<p>People who oppose this effort by these people to encourage the use and patronage of black businessse are counterproductive to what&rsquo;s good for America and&hellip; well, just plain stupid.</p>
<p>This is PRECISELY what blacks need to do in America.  They need to WAKE UP and realize how to build wealth, how to become self-sufficient, and what they need to do to become autonomous individuals rather than whining dependent malcontents.</p>
<p>This is what America is all about.  This is the ONLY way freedom is nurtured and sustained.  By entreprenuership.</p>
<p>Stop letting your emotions block common sense.  I mean, you are actually arguing against blacks doing something to HELP AMERICA and take the burden off white people to support them.  Every black who follows this path is one less black the democrats can count on.</p>

<p>The City of San Francisco has often considered getting rid of all city trash bins out on the street because the asian immigrant businesses dump all their trash in the city bins.</p>
<p>I once saw an asian apartment owner sweeping up in front of his building.  He dumped even the leaves and twigs in the trash can at the bus stop on his block.</p>

			<p>A number of years ago, a small neighborhood grocery store was up for sale on the east side of Detroit.  The owners were elderly, wanted to retire and were willing to help out the &#8220;new &#8221; owners with operation for s short time.  The total price for the business (which INCLUDED the building and stock) was $6000.00.  Now, there should have been at least ONE enterprising black individual (or couple) that would be interested in such an opportunity.  Such was NOT the case.  Some Chaldeans bought the business; it is extremely successful, doing business with the black neighborhood clientele.  Having lived there, I talked with various blacks who (I thought) would have been successful.  The answer given was that &#8220;it was too much like work&#8221; and that they would have to work &#8220;too many hours&#8221;.  These Chaldeans made this business successful; they live in an upscale suburb outside Detroit.  Need I say more?</p>

			<p>Small businesses have been crowded out by large chains.  Who, White or black goes to small drug, clothing, video and other stores any more?  Not many, because there are not that many small businesses left.</p>
<p>Most of the thriving small businesses are run by immigrants.  They succeed through slave labor, non payment of any kind of taxes from sales to even renewing their business licenses and cheating, lying and cheating.</p>
<p>I try to boycott the large chains that hire only hispanic clerks.  It is just about impossible if I wish to eat, bank my money, buy prescription drugs or anything else.</p>

<p>Count your blessings.  There is a law in St. Louis City that requires that a Walgreens exists where there are two perpendicularly intersecting major avenues.  So it seems.  Needless to say, I avoid Monopoly Rx just like I avoid Monopoly Mart as much as I can.  </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m all for this couple shopping where they choose and I&rsquo;m all for blacks creating their own businesses. As far as black owned business, in my areas we have several black owned food businesses that are very sucessful among whites. Blacks need to quit blaming whites, get off their backsides and do what whites, Koreans and everyone else has done.</p>

			<p>Just a couple of days ago, I was doing my banking at my local WAMU (now Bank of America).  The only Human depicted on their walls was a larger than life black woman - and this in Portland, which is about 90% white.  So I asked the teller if that poster is a national one or just local.  She wasn&rsquo;t sure.  I then pointed out to her that, if a bank in Detroit featured only a white person, the locals would vocally complain that it is &#8220;not a true reflection of the community&#8221;.  I told her that our area is 90% white and that the poster represents racism against whites.  I told her that whites are under-represented in such advertisements.  She seemed bewildered by my comments.  Almost as if I&rsquo;d spoken to her in tongues all of a sudden.  The easy way out is to fume inside and remain silent.  I&rsquo;ve chosen to speak out and I hope the rest of you do so as well.  If there were a bank that featured mostly white people, I would consider that bank to be a &#8220;white bank&#8221; and that&rsquo;s where I would take my business.  Unfortunately, there don&rsquo;t seem to be any banks like that.</p>

			<p>You&rsquo;re all not seeing the big picture here. You&rsquo;re so eager to out do one another and how pathetic, ignorant, or uncivilized that most blacks are that don&rsquo;t understand that the easiest way to win is to let blacks do what they want and say nothing about it. Sometimes it&rsquo;s wiser to say nothing at all and let your target group dig their own graves than to open your mouths and dirty your hands digging it for them. </p>

			<p>Lemme get this straight. When Asians, Hispanics, Jewish folks, Arabs, European ehtnics buy from their own then it is acceptable, ethnic/religious pride, entrepreneurial. </p>
<p>But when black folks do the same thing it is considered racism? What a convenient double standard. </p>
<p>(Not withstanding the fact that blacks can be prejudiced but not racist.)   </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve got news, honey&hellip;     Most American businesses would LOVE for you to establish a &#8216;network of black-owned businesses&rsquo;, and wouild LOVE for blacks to patronize only those businesses.</p>
<p>We live in a &#8216;white flight destination exurb&rsquo;.  Big box retailers are desperate to move into our tiny town.  This is not because sales here will be greater, but because white employees and white customers cause far fewer expensive problems.</p>
<p>Blacks spend like crazy, and go for goods and services with extremely high markups (unlike whites, who compulsively bargain-shop).  But that does not even begin to compensate for the endless theft, lawsuits, complaints, returns, and misbehavior of Black customers and their numerous offspring.  And it does not compensate for the sudden absence of white customers, who stay away from businesses staffed or patronized largely by blacks.</p>
<p>People drive to our town from places within a roughly 120 mile radius, to shop and go to the movies, because our town is (however briefly) still 97% white.  They pass by numerous WalMarts and Walgreens on their way to ours.  They stopped going to the movies in their home towns, because of black behavior there.  The cinemas in those towns have mostly closed.  The (largely black) capitol of our state does not have a single movie theatre.  When there is a &#8216;film festival&rsquo;, screenings have to be in college auditoriums, or at cineplexes in distant exurbs.  Black politicians have noted the lack of cinemas, and have trumpeted the &#8216;vast, untapped market&rsquo; the Capitol represents for theatre owners.  So far, not one company has seriously considered coming (or returning) to the city.  A dark theatre full of blacks quickly becomes something not too unlike the Super Bowl during Katrina.  I&rsquo;m sure the liability insurance would, alone, be enough to negate any profits to be made from such a &#8216;vast, untapped market&rsquo;. </p>
<p>&#8220;My people have been here for 400 years, and we don&rsquo;t even have a Walgreens to show for it.&#8221;  WHAT?  That has to be the most bizarre and nonsensical statement I&rsquo;ve ever read.  Wish I&rsquo;d run across it when I was taking logic.  Dissecting that one would have gotten me an A+, rather than an A- for the course.  The list of invalid assumptions I could dig out of that statement would be enough to fill a book. </p>

I understand your annoyance. You were venting. But telling it to the teller was pointless; she&rsquo;s just a clerk. You&rsquo;re putting her on the spot for something she can&rsquo;t control.  Even telling the manager is of little use either.  He (probably she) is also just a low-level employee. You&rsquo;d have to tell it to Headquarters.  Even then, I don&rsquo;t know what good it would do, since BofA is so huge. It would take thousands like you to get the message across. And they&rsquo;re totally committed to Diversity. (I know; I&rsquo;m a customer too.)</p>
<p>PS. I haven&rsquo;t seen white employees in my bank for years now. Diversity there doesn&rsquo;t include white.</p>

<p>I agree completely with your post. I have worked in various retail jobs all my life. Believe me, YOU DON&rsquo;T WANT blacks business. They are way too much trouble, even when they don&rsquo;t steal, pilfer or shoplift. I also stopped going to the theatre in my area because of the presence and very bad behaviour of loudmouth blacks there.</p>
