<h1><a href="https://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/casey/6436282.html">Mayor Quits Job for Gay Illegal Immigrant He Loves</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rick Casey, Houston Chronicle, May 21, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Only two weeks after being elected to serve his fourth term, Mayor J.W. Lown of San Angelo submitted his resignation letter Tuesday from an undisclosed location in Mexico.</p>
<p>No, being mayor of San Angelo is not exactly the same as being the King of the United Kingdom and Emperor of India, but the reason for Lown&rsquo;s abdication is the same as Edward&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Love.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lown told the San Angelo Standard-Times he had fallen for [a] man in March, after he had already filed for re-election. The man came to the U.S. five years ago to study at Angelo State University.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether he had a student visa, but if he did it apparently had expired.</p>
<p>Lown told the Standard-Times he chose not to take the oath of office while &#8220;aiding and assisting&#8221; a person who was illegally in the country.</p>
<p>Lown had been an extraordinarily popular mayor. Only 32 years old, he was elected in 2003 as the city&rsquo;s youngest mayor. Serving in an office that inevitably requires decisions that accumulate enemies, he managed to get re-elected three times with increasing margins of victory each time. Two weeks ago he defeated two challengers by garnering 89 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>Lown did not give the name of his lover, but said he planned to stay in Mexico to try to obtain a visa so that his partner can return with him if &#8220;the people of San Angelo will welcome me back.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} According to former Houston city councilman Gordon Quan, an immigration lawyer, Lown&rsquo;s partner faces two problems in seeking a visa that would permit residency in the U.S.</p>
<p>One involves restrictions caused by his having been in the United States illegally. If he had a student visa and overstayed it more than six months but less than a year, he is not eligible for a visa for three years. If it was more than a year, he must wait 10 years, even for a tourist visa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if Lown went to Iowa and married his partner by proxy. The federal government doesn&rsquo;t recognize same-sex marriages for immigration purposes.</p>

			<p>And as an aside, the IRS does not recognize gay &#8220;marriages.&#8221;  Furthermore, your marriage status on your state tax return and your Federal return has to be the same.  So if your state has gay marriage, and you are part of such a &#8220;union,&#8221; then you either have to lie to the state or lie to the Feds.</p>

			<p>This is another one of those stories that fits in well with my Time Machine fantasy.  In this fantasy I have a time machine that lets me go back 50 years, to 1959.  I&rsquo;m not allowed to invest in IBM or do anything else that would benefit me financially.  All I can do is show people news clippings and videos that enable them to see what the United States is like in 2009.  Not even the liberals of that time would be able to believe any of it.  They&rsquo;d lock me up as a lunatic.<br>

<p>I guess that will be the left&rsquo;s next crusade; making it legal for illegals to pay gays to marry them so they can get green cards.</p>

			<p>People are applauding this man for being honest. In a way, I see their point, but declining another term and  running off to Mexico to be with his gay lover because he&rsquo;s an illegal alien  and getting kudos for it makes me wonder if maybe we&rsquo;ve lost all our moral sense as a society. He didn&rsquo;t do anything laudable.<br>
   Time was a person who did something like that would try to keep it private. It certailnly isn&rsquo;t something that should be advertised.</p>

			<p>In India a man married his dog about a year ago. How elevating that India can be so all embracing as to not be so human supremacist by excluding other species to marry people. Soon we&rsquo;ll catch up I&rsquo;m sure. After all love is all that matters, and anyone that disagrees is evil like Hitler and should not be allowed free speach in the new world order. </p>

<p>Universal homosexual marriage now seems to be a done deal.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter that people have voted against it every time they get a chance (even in California!).  The usual left wing judges will pretend that the federal or their state constitution requires it, which somehow nobody knew up until now.</p>
<p>But the left never rests.  Having achieved that victory, what is their next move?  My choices:</p>
<p>1.  Legal marriage between a man and a consenting sheep.</p>
<p>2.  Legal pedophilia.</p>
<p>3.  Legal polygamy.</p>
<p>All of these may seem beyond the pale now, but so did homosexual marriage just 20 years ago.  I guarantee that at least one of these items will be a &#8220;done deal&#8221; by 2030.<br>

<p>          Petrarch, </p>
<p>          I don&rsquo;t understand what your India bashing has to <br>
          do with this Gay issue in the above article.   </p>
<p>          Just because one man married his dog doesn&rsquo;t mean<br>
          that this is standard practise or custom in India. <br>
          In fact most Indians don&rsquo;t even keep Dogs as pets, <br>
          let alone marry them!!  In reality dogs are treated<br>
          quite badly in some ways.   </p>
<p> <br>
          A year ago some stray dogs in the city of Bangalore,<br>
          mauled some children to death.  The reaction in the<br>
          city was astounding.  People were calling for the <br>
          mass murder of stray dogs, something like a <br>
          &#8220;Dogicide&#8221;.   Many dogs were put to death just like<br>
          that!     </p>
<p> <br>
         In every society there are some idiots who do things<br>
         of a questionable nature.  It doesn&rsquo;t mean that it is<br>
         something accepted by the society.   A few years back,<br>
         there were some news stories of people in GERMANY <br>
         indulging in CANNIBALISM.  Using your logic, would<br>
         this be an indication that majority of people in that<br>
         country approves or even sanctions such a despicable<br>
         behaviour? <br>
 </p>

			<p>Mexico has always been rough trade for cruisers, catamites, and bano amigos [ bathroom buddies ]. A Gay mexican would be the ultimate trophy to put in the glass exhibition vault at the bath house or democratic party convention.<br>
     I hope these two star crossed can get together. You gay bashers on this homo-phobic sight just don`t get true love. I`d have to love a man a great deal to let him do that to me.<br>
