			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Squires, Telegraph (London), May 11, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Italy does not want to become a &#8220;multi-ethnic&#8221; country and will continue its newly adopted policy of sending boatloads of immigrants and asylum seekers back to North Africa, the prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, said.</p>
<p>Previous Left-wing governments had &#8220;opened the doors to clandestine migrants coming from other countries, with an idea of a multi-ethnic Italy,&#8221; Mr Berlusconi said.</p>
<p>But that kind of society was &#8220;not our idea&#8221;, he added, as he sought to reassure Italians who were alarmed at the number of immigrants pouring into the country, particularly from eastern Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>The prime minister&rsquo;s vision of Italy was condemned by the centre-Left opposition. &#8220;Yes, Mr Premier, we have a different idea of Italy: multi-ethnic, pluralistic, free,&#8221; said Giovanna Melandri, of the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>&#8220;A country in which the colour of your skin, or race or religion doesn&rsquo;t matter, but, rather, honesty and sincerity of heart do.&#8221; Since launching a tough new policy on boat people last week, Italy has turned back six boats carrying a total of 1,500 immigrants and asylum seekers which were trying to reach the country&rsquo;s southernmost outpost, the island of Lampedusa.</p>
<p>The vessels were escorted back to Libya, the most popular jumping off point for clandestine immigrants, by the Italian coast guard and navy.</p>
<p>The boat people, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa and the Horn of Africa, trek across the Sahara and pay people smugglers thousands of pounds in the hope of securing a new life in Europe.</p>
<p>In the past, Italy would accept the immigrants and take them to the mainland for processing and identification before deciding whether to grant them asylum or some other form of protection.</p>
<p>The new approach was condemned by the UN&rsquo;s refugee agency, Medecins Sans Frontieres, the Vatican and Italian opposition MPs, who called it &#8220;a disgrace&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr Berlusconi, 72, dismissed the criticism, saying that from now on only those who met conditions for political asylum and set foot on Italian soil would be allowed into the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see no scandal,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s clear that in the sea we will lend assistance&#8221; to boat people. When migrants were rescued in international waters, Italy had the right not to take them in, he said.</p>
<p>On Sunday another boat, this time carrying 240 immigrants, was stopped by Italian patrol boats and escorted back to Libya.</p>
<p>The interior minister, Roberto Maroni, who is a member of the anti-immigrant Northern League party, part of the ruling coalition, hailed the return of migrants as &#8220;historic&#8221;.</p>
<p>He added that the &#8220;get-tough policy will continue as long as the boats set out&#8221; from the North African coast.</p>
<p>The government also has plans to force doctors and teachers to go to the authorities if they suspect their patients or pupils are illegal immigrants.<br>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t  think we should put our hopes in Berlusconi. He has a history of corruption and is a complete cynic, if the electorate wanted more immigrants he would fight to let them in. I fully support any measure to crack down mass 3rd world immigration but I would rather those measures be advocated by someone more reputable.</p>

			<p>Berlusconi is a hero! Thanks God the Italian people voted him back into office in 2006. Is there any way we can get Berlusconi to be President of the United States? he&rsquo;s 100X better than B.O.!</p>

			<p>I am absolutely amazed that an Italian political figure could say&hellip;&#8221;The prime minister&rsquo;s vision of Italy was condemned by the centre-Left opposition. &ldquo;Yes, Mr Premier, we have a different idea of Italy: multi-ethnic, pluralistic, free,&rdquo; said Giovanna Melandri, of the Democratic Party&hellip;&#8221;<br>
When across the Adriatic the horrible consequences of multi-ethnic Yugoslavia falling apart are so evident. One can only surmise the Communist element is behind this Democratic Party, and are hoping to gain (somehow) from the chaos of a similar catastrophe engulfing Italy. Once again, we see the &#8220;Phoenix principle&#8221; in play. The sloganeering emphasizes the &#8220;rebirth&#8221; from the ashes of a new more coherent polity once the cleansing fire of revolution happens. Of course, as in every Communist revolution, breakdown is not followed by rebirth and reinvigoration but rather by institutionalized breakdown. Inertia, fear, and stasis result from revolution and nothing else.</p>

			<p>Berlusconi claims Italy doesn&rsquo;t want to become Multi-Ethnic. Well, from what I&rsquo;ve read about his activities in old Italia, you sure as hell wouldn&rsquo;t know it. To me, Berlusconi seems to be just another one worldist, who profits from that philosophy whenever he can. He talks out of both sides of his mouth constantly, and I&rsquo;m amazed Italians aren&rsquo;t sick of the guy.</p>

			<p>We in the U.S. don&rsquo;t hear much about Haitian &#8220;boat people&#8221; much anymore but Coast Guard friends say they are still coming. We should do the same thing, and do away with the &#8220;setting foot on U.S. soil&#8221; rule, just catch them where we can, and send them home.</p>

			<p>At best, this is only a start.  All previously accepted immigrants need to have their cases &#8220;reviewed&#8221; by an impartial tribunal of Italian Friends of AmRen, or some such organization.  After a fair hearing, all the non-Whites should be deported.  The left has been importing a new electorate in every Western country, so there&rsquo;s no need to listen to any of their &#8220;Democracy&#8221; talk.  No patriot is bound to honor the promises of traitors.  </p>

<p>Giovanna, dear, you are sadly mistaken. If Italy becomes multi-ethnic and pluralistic, it will be anything but free.</p>
<p>&#8220;A country in which the colour of your skin, or race or religion doesn&rsquo;t matter, but, rather, honesty and sincerity of heart do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why, yes, if we just wish it, it will be so. Lets all have a group hug and sing Kum Ba Yah and all will be well.</p>

For many decades Italy has been a *multi-ethnic, pluralistic, free*, why Giovanna Melandri, of the Democratic Party cannot keep the country *multi-ethnic, pluralistic, free* without illegal immigrants?!</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

			<p>The truth is the average person, regardless of whether they are in the USA, Italy or anywhere else has never been asked whether they wanted mass immigration or diversity. The truth is most average people don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s something that has been foisted upon them by their politicians, the uber Left who want the votes and have a certain ideology and the globalists who want cheap labor. It&rsquo;s the will of the people that counts, not special interests.</p>

			<p>Berlusconi must either be high or not know the history of the Mediterranean countries. They&rsquo;ve all been multi-ethnic since ancient times. It&rsquo;s an area of ports. If you go to Italy, you&rsquo;ll see they don&rsquo;t have one culture, but many smaller indigenous ones. There wasn&rsquo;t even an Italy in existence as we know it until the 1860s, when Garibaldi unified the small nations of the peninsula.</p>

			<p>I salute the wisdom and will-power of our Italian brothers, who have rightly decided that being &#8220;Italian&#8221; entails more than just standing on a particular spot of ground.  They have moved to protect their nation, their culture, their people, and their future. </p>
<p>The fact that the UN and other bodies protest the Italians moving to protect themselves is an outright travesty.  The Italians owe NOTHING to the boat people, nor to the UN, nor to the continent of Africa itself.  They have the same right as any sovereign nation and people to determine their own future.  They should be honored and congratulated for actually daring to do so.</p>

   Is Ms. Melandri kidding? Bravo, Berlusconi! One of the few men left in Europe who isn&rsquo;t a gelding. His refusal to back down from his critics is refreshing and heartening. If the situation worsens here in the U.S.,I may have to start taking courses in Italian!</p>

Even the lowest IQ&rsquo;d tribe of primitives is smart enough not to believe that.  Was George Orwell right?  Are some ideas so outrageous that only an intellectual could believe them?  Maybe a society that believes this garbage deserves to be consumed by an invading alien force.</p>

<p>So what? How many blacks lived in 1860s Italy? How does Italy&rsquo;s having become a nation at that time oblige today&rsquo;s Italians to embrace racial and civilizational suicide? More pointless, over-ostentatious erudition.<br>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a couple of criticisms of Burlesconi here about being two faced and such. Personally I wouldn&rsquo;t care if the president of the U.S. had as many faces as Hydra, as long as he was running off and throwing out the illegals from America. The announced 30% shortfall in IRS revenue is going to have repercussions on all of us White Taxpaying Slaves.</p>

			<p>Yes indeed!!!  Race matters, color of one&rsquo;s skin matters, religion matters!</p>
<p> It is the only GLUE that holds a nation and culture together. Mix them all together and all you have is chaos, disunity, racial strife, poverty, escalating crime rates, outrageous taxation, miscegnation, a loss of cultural identity and the list goes on. We see it all right here in the USA and what it has wrought this nation.</p>

			<p>      People complain that he appoints women on the basis of<br>
their looks. For my money, he can appoint a whole cabinet of<br>
beautiful women and make them his harem. Even then, he would<br>
still have more sanity in his little finger than any other pol-<br>
itician in Europe. Is he only doing it to get elected? I hope<br>
not but getting elected is important! Maybe our Republicans should try listening to their base, doing what it wants, and ac-<br>
tually get elected. If leaders can&rsquo;t lead, then at least perhaps<br>
they could follow. Mr Berlesconi at least is smart eneough to<br>
do that.</p>

			<p>I was recently in Rome and from just walking around the streets you could see among the native Italians that some looked the same as people from north of the Alps while others were darker and clearly looked Greek or Middle Eastern.</p>

			<p>I like Italians - get one very well with them. In fact virtually grew up with Italian kids. And I like Italy, one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Italians also did not have too much of a colonial history - so in that sense I don&rsquo;t have too much problems with what Berlusconi is saying. Similar with countries like Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Lithuania.</p>
<p>However the case is obviously different for the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, countries founded in non-white areas on non-white lands. Same even goes for Russia - in fact there are millions of Russians in Central Asian countries whose presences was there by invasion.</p>
<p>Obviously the UK and France had large colonial empires - so they really cannot complain too much - after all they promoted the greatness of the British and French civilizations respectively - so the fact that the natives bought into this and decided to want a piece of this for themselves is only to be expected.</p>
<p>Afterall their populations will reflect <i>their</i> history - their colonial history. So to me there is nothing unnatural about this. </p>
<p>In spite of the above, non-whites still can make some sort of moral claim to live in any Western European country like Norway, Sweden, and Italy and even an Asian country like Japan. Western Europe and Japan even today still benefit from the spoils of past imperial and colonial plunder. The wealth from those directly engaged in imperialism obviously spilled over to benefit the likes of Switzerland, and Sweden.</p>
<p>So non-whites do have some claim on those places as well. And so do Asians against Japan. But the claim is a lot little weaker for countries like Sweden and Switzerland than it is for countries like France and Britain. As for Japan, I have always held that China has the moral right, indeed duty, to invade and do what it likes with her - but of course this should be of no concern to people on this website. </p>
<p>On a personal note though, I would like to see Italy, Austria, Sweden, and Switzerland remain untouched and unchanged - as I visit those countries and enjoy the indigenous culture of those places. </p>

			<p>Italy has the lowest birthrate in Europe, so closing its borders is is only half the challenge, the others is having enough children in the coming 20 years to prevent Italy from disappearing from the earth.</p>

			<p>While it&rsquo;s true the Berlusconi doesn&rsquo;t really care about anything but wealth and power for himself, it&rsquo;s amazing that the political climate in Italy is so much further to the right on immigration/identity issues than it is in the US.  Actually, it&rsquo;s really all the English speaking countries where racial masochism among the elites is most extreme.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;We have a different version of Italy, multi-ethnic, pluralistic, free..&#8221;</p>
<p>Pardon me for asking but can&rsquo;t a mono-ethnic country be free too? What is the connection between &#8220;multi-ethnicity&#8221; and freedom? Hasn&rsquo;t Italy been free for several decades as a mono-ethnic country? How is a homogeneous Italy incompatible with freedom? </p>
<p>&#8220;A country in which the color of your skin, your race or religion don&rsquo;t matter,,,&#8221;</p>
<p> But they DO MATTER. That is exactly WHY there is an Italy. Because an ethnic group with one language, culture, heritage, social mores and cultural makeup occupy this peninsula and it is their homeland. That should be respected and not changed. Especially when the changes are not asked for but are merely a &#8220;camp of the saints&#8221; scenario. And all evidence around the world shows homogeneity is better then diversity. The Italians nedd only look across the Adriatic to ex-Yugoslavia for this. </p>

			<p>Hopefully, we have just witnessed a sea-change in politics, in that Silvio Berlusconi appears to be the first head of state of a major White nation who has openly and explicitly nailed his colors firmly to the mast, unequivocally stating that he does not wish to see his nation degenerate into a multi-racial state.<br>
   Whether this is merely as &#8216;flash in the pan&rsquo; or the start of a new trend, I don&rsquo;t know, but the jaded cynic in me unfortunately prevails.<br>
  Saying all that it is remarkable that Signor Berlusconi is the continued victim of a mosrt vicious campaign of hatred, character assassination and vilification stoked up by the hard left in his own nation and (for some reason) the British gutter press.The galactically stupid and pompous people who write for &#8216;The Economist&rsquo; seem to be the most rabid and mange-ridden of the dog-pack, followed closely the sex-obsessed (but outwardly sex-hating) tiny bourgeous minds of the Daily Mail.<br>
  - There is no doubt a connection between the hatred and bile of the British gutter press (who deservedly have a reutation as being the worst in the World), and Sr. Berlusconi&rsquo;s bravery (the British gutter press will no doubt call it &#8216;populism&rsquo;)in tackling the non-White immigration catastrophe.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t even an Italy in existence as we know it until the 1860s, when Garibaldi unified the small nations of the peninsula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Italian culture and nation, existe from tha Augusto age, in that period all tha inhabitants of Italy were Roman citizens, after the fall of the roman empire, Italy was divide in small kingdoms until 1860.<br>
But a state isn&rsquo;t an ethnic Nation, in fact all the small kindoms shared the same culture, and the unification of Italy was a popular will and not an inheritance&rsquo;s war.<br>
For to be clear: West Germany and East Germany, weren&rsquo;t a state, but were a nation!<br>
America, is a state but, isn&rsquo;t a Nation today.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think we should put our hopes in Berlusconi. He has a history of corruption and is a complete cynic, if the electorate wanted more immigrants he would fight to let them in. I fully support any measure to crack down mass 3rd world immigration but I would rather those measures be advocated by someone more reputable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe all the things you read in the ELITIST&rsquo;s newspapers, is their truth, not the truth.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;I was recently in Rome and from just walking around the streets you could see among the native Italians that some looked the same as people from north of the Alps while others were darker and clearly looked Greek or Middle Eastern.&#8221;</p>
<p>Probably you see some immigrants, Italians don&rsquo;t looks like nordic people or middle eastern people, Italians are Italians, we are proud of that.<br>

<p>Well there was an austrian political leader, named JÖRG HAIDER. He led the austrian freedom party, and was the govenor of Carinthia for a prolonged time (until hies death last year)</p>
<p>For Information take a look on the leftist-liberal wikipedia.:<br>
at &#8220;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rg_Haider&#8221;</p>
<p>His words, and he regularly recited it.:<br>
&#8220;The social order of Islam is opposed to our Western values. Human rights and democracy are as incompatible with the Muslim religious doctrine as is the equality of women. In Islam, the individual and his free will count for nothing; faith and religious struggle – jihad, the holy war – for everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>He really oposed all form of immigration, his party run an anti immigration agenda.</p>
<p>Joerg Haider died in 2008 in a car accident. Some details of his death remain unclear, a lot of right wing people, including me think, he has been killed. </p>

<p>None but ardent students of history would be aware of the atrocities committed by the Japanese against the Chinese, it makes the Jewish/Nazi thing look like a small traffic accident. The Koreans fared no better with the Japanese!! in fact, NO Asian people fared very well with the Japanese. The Chinese had their own &#8220;trail of tears&#8221; and they called it that, led by none other than Mao Tse Tung.</p>

			<p><i>&#8220;Berlusconi must either be high or not know the history of the Mediterranean countries. They&rsquo;ve all been multi-ethnic since ancient times. It&rsquo;s an area of ports. If you go to Italy, you&rsquo;ll see they don&rsquo;t have one culture, but many smaller indigenous ones. There wasn&rsquo;t even an Italy in existence as we know it until the 1860s, when Garibaldi unified the small nations of the peninsula.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t matter.   Spain, Germany, France,  Britain, have many parts with regional customs and accents.   So what?</p>
<p>True that Italy was a collection of various separate, independent states   &mdash;   as was Germany, for that matter.   But politically unified or not, there was always a cultural and geographical place known as  &#8220;Italy&#8221;.  People knew what was meant by Italy, for centuries before there was a political entity by that name.  &#8220;Italy&#8221; was not suddenly invented in 1860, upon unification.  It was always there.  The same with Germany in 1870.  Did Poland not exist until  1918?   Would you say there was no such place as Ireland, before Irish independence in 1921?  No Irish people?  No Irish nation or culture?   The Jews had no country for many, many centuries, but there were still Jews.  There was no Armenia, but there were Armenians.   You have to distinguish the place and people  from the government (or absence of it).  </p>

<p>Honesty and sincerity of heart:   how nice!   So that&rsquo;s what it takes for citizenship. In other words, if they&rsquo;re &#8220;nice&#8221; people and tell the truth, they can all be Italians.  So come on, Africa! Just be nice, and you&rsquo;ll be welcome.<br>

			<p><i>&#8220;the UK and France had large colonial empires - so they really cannot complain too much - after all they promoted the greatness of the British and French civilizations respectively - so the fact that the natives bought into this and decided to want a piece of this for themselves is only to be expected.<br>
  <br>
In spite of the above, non-whites still can make some sort of moral claim to live in any Western European country like Norway, Sweden, and Italy and even an Asian country like Japan. Western Europe and Japan even today  <b>still benefit from the spoils of past imperial and colonial plunder.   </b>The wealth from those directly engaged in imperialism obviously spilled over to benefit the likes of Switzerland, and Sweden.<br>

Mr Liu&rsquo;s argument holds water only if you&rsquo;re conditioned to see imperialism as the great monster of history, the central issue explaining everything in the modern world, and the ONLY thing that counts.  And furthermore, that all of Europe&rsquo;s wealth and progress was merely  &#8220;plunder&#8221; wrung from its hapless possessions abroad.   In other words, Europeans got rich because they made others poor. Their wealth was theft.  So, for him it&rsquo;s a case of getting even.   But that&rsquo;s just an ideological point of view. Pure Marxist rationalization.   At least, though, unlike others,  he&rsquo;s open and honest about it, instead of trying to disguise it under devious arguments.</p>

			<p>I was walking through a park in Rome, Italy the other day and I saw a flyer put up by a neighborhood committee had organized a campaign to save another local park.</p>
<p>What struck me was the simple drawing on the flyer: three cartoon boys playing soccer.  All were white.  The drawing is visible on the committee&rsquo;s website: https://tinyurl.com/q848oa . It is unthinkable to me that any such drawing in the U.S. or most other countries would feature three white boys. No, it would in all probability include a black boy, a white girl, and perhaps an asian or brown-skinned character of indeterminate race.  </p>
<p>In Italy they are still, for a short while longer, free enough and innocent enough not to worry about &#8220;including&#8221; any and all aggrieved parties that may decide to be offended.</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Hofer" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Hofer</a><br>
Hofer is a fine example of a man who loved his country, kith and ken to death. Literally.<br>
It will take such devotion if we are ever going to save the nation our forebears left us.<br>
You will never encounter men like Hofer in school histories because of, well, you know why:<br>
-He is a man in the biological sense.<br>
-He is a White man<br>
-He ardently loves his own before and above all. (therefore)<br>
-He is a Man in the more important exsistential sense. He is a Man. Men will ALWAYS fight and die for those they love.<br>
We realize that these immutable truths are very inconvenient to the rulers of the Novus Ordo.</p>
<p>To make a few more points if I may?<br>
Italy will do well if they remember who they always have been throughout the centuries. </p>
<p>We will do well if we begin retrieving these men from the closet they have been relegated to by &#8220;Progressive Education&#8221;.  More importantly, we need to asume the role of teacher in whatever capacity we serve in this life. Passing along the information has always been mens responsibility, and we need to begin taking that responsibility seriously. If no, then two generations hence, our children will believe beyond the possibility of comprehension that American or Western History is chiefly a theater of engagement by outraged outsiders who knew better than the long gruntled.</p>

			<p>&#8220;However the case is obviously different for the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, countries founded in non-white areas on non-white lands. Same even goes for Russia - in fact there are millions of Russians in Central Asian countries whose presences was there by invasion.Obviously the UK and France had large colonial empires - so they really cannot complain too much - after all they promoted the greatness of the British and French civilizations respectively - so the fact that the natives bought into this and decided to want a piece of this for themselves is only to be expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense. If you look at the history of the world, non-whites did every bit as much conquering as whites did. Non-white nations and tribes  fought against each other and conquered each other. In the matters of the USA,Canada and Australia, non-whites came from somewhere else and only occupied a small area. Most of these areas were unoccupied when whites came and there was no &#8220;nation&#8221; at the time. (According to you logic, then no nation, white or non-white has the right to have borders and can let anyone in.) However, all of this has nothing to do with today. Today, we have nations and each nation has the right to exist and to protect its&rsquo; established borders. This goes for the USA, Canada, the UK, Japan, China or anywhere else. Non-whites have no more right to go to the USA or Canada or the UK then AMerican, Canadians and Brits have the right to go to India, Mexico, China or wherever.</p>

			<p>Stopping the invasion by sea is a vital first step but more will be needed to prevent a multi-ethnic future. If Berlusconi is sincere he should take further actions. (1) He&rsquo;ll have to control immigration coming from the rest of Europe, both at the borders as well as having internal controls within Italy. This will likely put him and Italy in conflict with the EU administration. (2) He&rsquo;ll have to deal with government workers and university professors who are working hard to achieve the multi-ethnic objective. Many will have to be purged from their jobs. I suggest as a litmus test they be asked their opinion about the future of traditional ethnic Italians. If their social theories can&rsquo;t handle the ethnic rights of Italians, then that will be cause for dismissal. (3) Ways have to be found to give voice to the large majority of Italians who don&rsquo;t approve of ethnic transformation. Individuals who speak out are usually ostracized and bullied back into line. There is strength in numbers but it needs to be mobilized. Berlusconi could help establish Italian ethnic clubs across the country.</p>

			<p><i>Non-whites have no more right to go to the USA or Canada or the UK then AMerican, Canadians and Brits have the right to go to India, Mexico, China or wherever</i></p>
<p>Certainly not an automatic legal right, but non-whites were in America, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand for a long time before whites. So those countries never were whites only countries, and there is no reason why only whites should get to decide who should enter them. Maybe black Americans would prefer black immigrants over white-surely their opinion and feelings should hold equal weight to white opinion? And maybe native Americans (who have all but been decimated) would prefer native American immigrants from South America, to make the US more congenial to them? And Innuits might feel racially more empathetic to Chinese and Japanese immigrants rather than Russian immigrants to Canada?</p>
<p><i>In the matters of the USA,Canada and Australia, non-whites came from somewhere else and only occupied a small area.</i></p>
<p>Incorrect, but more importantly irrelevant. Non-whites violently resisted the encroachment of whites - they never just accepted that whites could take their land- no matter how sparsely populated. Furthermore applying this logic, China would have the moral justification to invade and occupy Australia - after all, vast tracts of Australia are still virtually unpopulated. Maybe China should take all of the Northern Territories - how would you feel about that then?</p>
<p><i>Non-white nations and tribes fought against each other and conquered each other.</i> </p>
<p>So it is OK then, from your point of view, to flood Sweden and Poland with non-whites - on account of those two countries having warred with each other in the past?</p>
<p>Anonymous at 8:03 PM on May 12: you miss the point. There is no real moral justification to prevent the immigration of non-whites into Europe. Non-whites should, and do, feel completely morally justified to enter Europe, based on past colonial exploitation and even the unjust economic order prevailing today.</p>
<p>And in any case millions of non-whites in Europe is balanced by millions of whites in formerly non-white North and South America, and Australasia. </p>
<p>So morally whites have no real reason to complain.</p>
<p>But from a survival, Darwinian point of view, they might well have. You cannot have your cake and eat it too. You cannot be moral and restrictionist at the same time. You cannot claim some unique quality of reciprococity, and bask in your righteousness, while at the same time prevent non-whites from enjoying the proceeds of their own exploitation at the hands of whites.</p>
<p>But still it would be a shame for countries like France and Italy to be destroyed by immigration of hostile, and even non-hostile foreigners ( I agree that large scale immigration will destroy the indigenous culture - as happened to the Native Americans, New Zealand Maori, and Australian aborigines).</p>
<p>So the way to approach the problem is ensuring economic justice across the world, and the West helping the non-West build themselves up. When this happens people will have less incentive to leave their homelands - after all- how big a problem is Japanese immigration into the US these days?</p>

			<p><i>And furthermore, that all of Europe&rsquo;s wealth and progress was merely &ldquo;plunder&rdquo; wrung from its hapless possessions abroad. In other words, Europeans got rich because they made others poor.</i></p>
<p>Even if none of Europe&rsquo;s wealth and progress resulted from her conquering and massacrign foreign peoples that is not the point. The victim has the right to demand redress from the criminal - based on the scale of the crime, not on how much the criminal may have profited or utilized those proceeds of crime.</p>
<p>The fact is if the third world presented a bill to the first world for compensation for past criminal actions of whites, any figure justly arrived at would bankrupt the West. <br>
The West should feel grateful that they have gotten away virtually scott free. After all how much have Germans compensated Namibians for genocide of the Hereros, or Belgians for killing up to 20 million Congolese for rubber, or British to China for the ravages of the Opium War? Nothing.</p>
<p>So having a few non-whites in Europe is small price to pay for the annihilation of many non-white populations and the plunder of others.</p>

<p>Everything you say is utter rubbish. Just rationalization and self-deception. Europe&rsquo;s wealth did not come from colonialism. Germany had only a few African territories and only for a very brief time. No serious person would say that Germany became a prosperous nation because of them. Look at how Germany was ruined after WW2. What role did Africa play in Germany&rsquo;s return to modernity? NONE. The Scandanavian countries had no empires and they are the best countries in Europe. I don&rsquo;t see Japan letting in millions of Chinese because of their previous occupation of Taiwan or attempted conquest of China. Non-White immigrants have no &#8220;right&#8221; to be in Europe or White overseas countries. Not just no &#8220;legal&#8221; right but no right period. Immigration (which I see as an 18th and 19th century outdated phenomenon) is a privilege not a right.</p>

<p>I did, read an earlier post of mine. But regardless of our issues with the Japanese, we still have every right to hold the British accountable for their crimes and plunder. Because a member of your family was raped, does not mean you need to forgive a criminal who merely burgled your family home. Where do you come up with that sort of logic?</p>

<p>The West as a WHOLE benefited from colonial plunder, even those not directly involved in colonialism. That corner of the world industrialized at the expense of the rest of the world.</p>
<p>As far as say Germany is concerned, she did come relatively late to imperialism - but she made up with it with massive atrocities in Africa, and also Asia. Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Italy, the US, Japan, Austria Hungary, all played their part in ravaging China in the 19th and early twentieth centuries. Their is a <i>massive</i> debt owed the Chinese by the West.</p>
<p>China will not call in that debt - so long as the West remains respectful. </p>

<p>Let me answer you. Tibetans are Chinese. Chinese do not just include Han, but people who have historically and currently live within the borders of the Chinese empire. Tibetans are Chinese in a similar way to Cherokee being American. Surely no one here would deny Cherokees are American?</p>
<p>Furthermore how can you say Chinese colonialism, when China&rsquo;s right to Tibet is well established and recognized by every single sovereign  nation in the world, including all Western nations. China does not occupy or claim any territory which is not rightfully hers, and is not recognized by everyone else in the world as righfully hers.</p>
<p>And by the way so-called vicious Chinese colonialism means 10 to 20 percent Han in Tibet and 80 to 90 percent Tibetans - compared with 2percent or less (and even these 2 percent racially diluted) indigenous peoples in the US and Australia. </p>
<p>So in that sense, white colonialism is about 40 times as bad as your so-called Chinese &#8216;colonialism.&rsquo;</p>
<p><br>
People on this board are just so illogical. It was whites who wrought the greatest demographic shifts in the history of the world - they are the ones who invaded and displaced peoples all over the world - and then find themselves aghast that they occassionally come into contact with non-whites. Even more surprising is after all the crimes by whites against non-whites, whites are surprised that some non-whites have feelings of hostility against them.</p>
<p>Perhaps White Nationalists should be grateful for censorship against their views. If made fully public, your pathetic illogical arguments would be blown out of the water.</p>
<p>The fact that your views remain underground is perhaps the reason for the little success you do have. </p>
<p>And even if WN views gained currency - I can hardly imagine 35 out of 100 Americans gladly sitting back and accepting Jim Crow or deportation. </p>
<p>Fact is the horse is bolted. Maybe you can preserve Latvia and a handful of Eastern European states as overwhelmingly white. But everywhere else - too late. Sorry.</p>

<p>We could also ask Mr. Liu about Singapore and Taiwan, whose original populations were not Chinese.   How does explain their  &#8220;debt&#8221;?    Do they have an obligation to take in more immigrants from everywhere in order to neutralize the now-dominant Chinese?   </p>
<p>Did China get rich off its many offshore &#8220;colonies&#8221;?  As well as the ones to the west, in Central Asia?  Does it now have a huge debt to pay for its historic expotation of these non-Chinese peoples?</p>

			<p>&#8220;And furthermore, that all of Europe&rsquo;s wealth and progress was merely &ldquo;plunder&rdquo; wrung from its hapless possessions abroad. In other words, Europeans got rich because they made others poor. Their wealth was theft. &#8220;<br>
  &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;     &mdash;   </p>
<p>Speaking of aborigines in Africa, Australia and the New World, the fact is that when we encountered them, they were already poor. Poor isn&rsquo;t even the word for it! They had ALWAYS been  wretchedly, unimaginably poor.  They were still in the Stone Age.   They didn&rsquo;t have a metal knife or woven blanket. Most were naked, where weather allowed.  They never saw iron, glass or a wheel. [Some Africans did have iron.]  They were incomparably poorer then than they are now.</p>
<p>As for more civilized  places such as Arabia, India and China, even they are far better off today, as a result contact with the West,  than they were in 1500 at the opening of the Colonial Period.   They have all benefited immeasurably from the exchange.  Instead, all some people like Mr. Lieu can do is hold out their hands and complain about how much we owe them!</p>

<p>BUT&hellip;. it must be noted that opium is not grown in any part of the British Isles!</p>
<p>It was the opium growers, merchants and bankers IN INDIA, (who were then citizens of the British Empire) who agitated for this war and whose interests were being served.  This had nothing to do with people back in Birmingham or Glasgow or Dublin   &mdash;    although it was inevitably they who were compelled to bleed and fight in the Empire&rsquo;s  wars.</p>

<p><br>
All the information here is from J. K. Rummel&rsquo;s book, Death by Government. As you can see, China has the bloodiest history of any nation in the world.</p>
<p>You may dispute the exact numbers, but no serious scholar will doubt that Mao made the most victims among all tyrant in history, and certainly more victims than all the European nations combined during colonialism, (and of course he killed more Chinese than Japan ever did).</p>
<p>You may answer that the Chinese inflicted all this on each other. Fine. Then before you go tell Whites to apologize and repay our debts to the Chinese people, you must logically go tell the Chinese rulers to apologize and repay their own debt to the Chinese people. See what happens to you.</p>
<p><br>
I know that Confucianism stresses reciprocity, and perhaps you could appeal to Confucian principles to argue that if a nation conquers another, then in the next century the other nation must conquer her back. You know what? We are not Confucians. We are Europeans, and our own ethics says: how can a man say to his neighbor, &#8216;Friend, let me take out the speck in your eye,&rsquo; when he himself does not see the log in his own eye? So I will not accept reciprocity lectures from someone who seems to endorse the nation which committed the most crimes in history.</p>

			<p>John Liu,</p>
<p>Your entire argument is based on the notion that Europeans owe non-Europeans reparations for past injustices. This ridiculous idea can easily be debunked. </p>
<p>Before European colonialism:</p>
<p>  &mdash;  The Saracens conquered; Spain, Portugal, Southern Italy, Sicily and invaded France. </p>
<p>  &mdash;  The Mongolians tried to overrun Europe, which resulted in the death of over half of the European population.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  The Turks invaded and/or conquered; Austria, Poland, Greece, Rhodes, Malta, Croatia, Lithuania, Albania, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Moldavia, etc.</p>
<p><br>
So as you can see, your distorted version of world history, which portrays non-Europeans as the continual victims of European oppression, is patently false. </p>
<p>Between 711 A.D. and 1700 A.D. Europe was under constant invasion by the Saracens, Mongolians and the Ottoman empire. This was centuries before Europe&rsquo;s colonial era. It wasn&rsquo;t until Europeans organized their forces and starting driving these invaders out of Europe that they begin taking territory of their own.</p>
<p>European colonialism was just a response to non-European colonialism. So whatever Europe supposedly gained from colonialism is reparations for the invasions, massacres and enslavement Europeans suffered at the hands of non-Europeans for over 1000 years. </p>
<p>So what have we learned here today, little fella?</p>
<p>1) Europe owes the world nothing.</p>
<p>2) European nations have the right to self-determination. Which includes defending their borders and enforcing their immigration laws. Kudos to Berlusconi. </p>
<p>3) If the past is any indication of the future, Europe being re-colonized by Muslims will mean the end of Western civilization.<br>

<p>Your strawman arguments are ridiculous. You are an Asian with a chip on your shoulder, nothing more. Look at all the Whites kidnapped and sent to the Maghreb. Does Europe have a claim on North Africa because of this? I am White but I do not think so. Look at the Turkish conquest of Anatolia and 500 year enslavement of the Balkans? Do White Europeans have a right to reclaim Constantinople? The 700 year Arab conquest of Spain. The Turkish atrocities of the Armenians. None of this figures in your mentality does it! The real point is though, non-Whites are coming to Europe because they seek a better life, financed by the White taxpayer. They would be trying to do this had there never been any European imperialism. Nor is non-White immigration to Europe GOOD for the White people there! </p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that the reason the moderator posts the anti-White rants of Chinese nationalists is to remind the Asiaphiles that their love is not always reciprocated.  We&rsquo;re just lucky that there&rsquo;s an ocean between us.  BTW, those posters that worry about a Chinese takeover can take a break.  They are spying like crazy, but in the event of major racial violence, they&rsquo;ll be taking their money and splitting.  They&rsquo;re not cowards, but I can&rsquo;t see them wasting their precious sons&rsquo; lives to stay among the foreign devils.  When the milk is gone, they&rsquo;ll abandon the cow.</p>

			<p>Italian person: those figures of Rummels are ridiculous - especially those pertaining to Mao. But this is not the place to argue rebut you on this point - you can carry on believing them - that is fine with me. And even if the figures were true, it makes no difference to the argument here. </p>
<p>One thing however - saying Chinese are the most violent is like saying that Swedes are much more violent than Tongans - because there are more murders in Sweden than there are in Tonga.</p>
<p><i>You may answer that the Chinese inflicted all this on each other. Fine. Then before you go tell Whites to apologize and repay our debts to the Chinese people, you must logically go tell the Chinese rulers to apologize and repay their own debt to the Chinese people.</i></p>
<p>So I can burgle the house of a man who beats his wife, and demand immunity from prosecution by pointing this out to the police? Obviously not. Whatever the situation between the man and his wife, that has no bearing on the principle that the burglar should be punished, and it has no bearing on the severity of that punishment.</p>
<p>The fact is most ethnic groups, the Anglo Saxons probably being the exception, have suffered more at the hands of their own people, than they have from others. Probably more Italians have killed Italians than have ever been killed by non-whites. Does this, to you, justify those non-white violent acts against Italians that do occur?</p>
<p>On a different scale, should we assume because of the vast bloodletting on the European continent in the 20th Century - that whites as a whole, have no right, to complain about non-white misbehaviour in white countries - after all non-whites with high crime statistics could then point to whites and say &#8216;so what - a few rapes and murders -are nothing compared to the slaughter you whites carried out against each other not too long ago.&rsquo; Obviously if a non-white did try to justify murder or mayhem on this basis, you Mr Italian, as well as most members of this site, would find it ridiculous - as would I and most other right thinking people.</p>
<p>So in short, whatever Chinese ever did to Chinese, that does not cancel the debt the West owes China. </p>
<p><i>We are not Confucians. We are Europeans, and our own ethics says: how can a man say to his neighbor, &lsquo;Friend, let me take out the speck in your eye,&rsquo; when he himself does not see the log in his own eye?</i></p>
<p>If that is the case you are obviously against hypocrisy Mr Italian. That is good. </p>
<p>But let us consider this. There are almost one million Italian descended people in Australia. There are about 17 million in the United States. In both cases Italians vastly outnumber the original inhabitants of both Australia and the US. </p>
<p>Lets add on the Argentine total of 25 million - total world wide of about 25 + 17 + 1= 43 million Italians that do not live in Italy.</p>
<p>Note that in Argentina, the native Americans, as well as Afro-Argentinians, were basically slaughtered off to make way for your kind.</p>
<p>So when we consider there are only about 60 million Italians in Italy but over 40 million abroad, don&rsquo;t you see that it could be seen by some people that Italians moaning about the 5 percent non-Italians in Italy (many who are whites anyway) is more than just a little hypocritical? After all there are more overseas Italians (43 million at least) than overseas Chinese (40 million).</p>
<p>So indeed Italian person, I am more than happy to talk of motes and specks.</p>

			<p>Actually the ongoing discussion about who did what to whom and when is academic. The winner in the demographic contest gets to write the history.</p>
<p>There is no good or bad&hellip;.only winners and losers. Mr.Liu is probably right that the west is dying and that the various &#8216;European&rsquo; stock is in dramatic decline is obvious.</p>
<p>But no one knows the future&hellip;.a global plague, nuclear war&hellip;revolutions and riots. Will the future see the rise of another Hitler-like figure? Probably, but what race or ethno-cultural identity will he (she) promote?</p>
<p>Sorry to say but the only truth comes after the battle is won, and the victors get to say what truth is. Read your history. Was Alexander good or bad? How about Caesars&rsquo; Gallic Wars? Caesar and his soldiers slaughtered the Celts (who were &#8216;white&rsquo;) man, woman and child. Any tears over that? Anyone care to discuss Attila and his deeds. The innocent died and the victors procreated. End of story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same today. If the west chooses death then it&rsquo;s death and destruction they will get. The last days won&rsquo;t be pretty. BTW: whatever happened to the Etruscans?</p>
<p>The Scottish, some of the remnants are left after the Romans built Hadrians Wall, From Caesars assault in 60 BC to emperor Severus&rsquo; attack in 200 AD and on to Culloden in 1746 then the Clearances in the 19th century. The Gaelic language is dying. And what&rsquo;s left is grown men in skirts and so proud yet. That&rsquo;s life. </p>
<p>You can console yourselves by recounting past treacheries and heroic deeds. But it&rsquo;s all in vain without progeny. Breed or die.</p>

			<p><i>&ldquo;&hellip;currently live within the borders of the Chinese Empire.&rdquo; John Liu.<br>
By your own hand, John Liu, China is an imperialist power. </i></p>
<p>Sorry, China&rsquo;s empire is of the nature of the Holy Roman Empire - an empire ruling people of closely related races and ethnicities.</p>
<p>In this way it differs from the British Empire, or the American Empire today.</p>
<p><i>Also, a principle of Western ethics is that children cannot be held accountable for the guilt of the parents. In Italian we say: Le colpe dei padri non ricadono sui figli. </i></p>
<p>Yes, but creditors can claim against the family estate of the deceased parents. China will demand reparations from the West, not the assignation of criminal culpability to whites today.</p>

<p>Very interesting. Are you basing your Western ethics on secular laws or the Bible? Because I was under the impression that in the Bible it&rsquo;s written the sons will bear the sins of the fathers.  This web site argues both sides of the issue </p>

			<p><i>It seems that imperialist China invaded Vietnam every other week in the last two millennia. How about you pay that debt back?</i></p>
<p>We have. China supplied massive aid to Vietnam during its war against the French and US. Ho Chi Minh was made in China. And it is well known PLA troops were in Vietnam in the 60s - I personally know several, friends of my dad. One was a sniper who killed several American soldiers.</p>

<p>Italians have every right to determine what kind of nation Italy will be, just as nations which have accepted Italian immigrants have the right to make that determination with respect to their own countries. Natterings about who emigrates more has no bearing upon the question at all. </p>

			<p>When the Bible says that sons will bear the sins of the fathers, it means that children have to live with the consequences of their parents actions, not that they are locked up because daddy was a sheep thief.  If daddy is in the pokey for thievery, the family is unsupported, for example.  I don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;ll find any of the 613 laws of Moses requiring that a child shall be placed on trial for crimes committed by an older relative.</p>

			<p>Like the Holy Roman Empire (the First Reich), Hitler&rsquo;s empire (the Third Reich) ruled over people of closely related races and ethnicities.  Does the fact that subject peoples are linguistically and racially related to their overlords make an empire a good thing?  <br>
     China&rsquo;s empire is very old, but it was built the same way as other empires: the subjugation of other peoples.  They may all call themselves Han, but at one time, there were many different peoples in what is now known as &#8220;China.&#8221;  That is why there are so many so-called dialects.  They&rsquo;re not dialects, they are mutually incomprehensible languages, languages spoken by ancient nations that were conquered by the Emperors.  <br>
     This doesn&rsquo;t bother me, those battles were fought a thousand or more years ago.  What is troubling is the arrogance that allows a fool to believe that his country is blameless, and therefore justified in threatening other nations.  I don&rsquo;t like that attitude in Americans, Europeans, or Chinese.  America&rsquo;s empire, and it is correct to call it that, is hopefully collapsing.  Let the American troops come home, and let the foreigners among us go home too, taking their dollars and their cultures with them.<br>

			<p>Will China be inviting Africans to move to China and rape short Chinese people as if they were Pygmies?  And when will China pay its debt to Africa, its new colony?  Oh, that&rsquo;s right, Chinese imperialism is good, White imperialism is bad.  </p>

			<p>Excuse the psychology, but it seems to me that these 3rd Worlders who live among us yet revile our ways doth protest too much.  So proud of their own culture and nation, they claim, but unwilling to live in it, kind of like American Blacks.  I think their hatred is driven by envy, and shame at the fact that they have to come here to live as they wish.  Their over-the-top nationalism is a way of compensating for having betrayed and abandoned their homeland, being more Catholic than the Pope as we say.  </p>
