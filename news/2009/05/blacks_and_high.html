<h1><a href="/ar/2006/06.html#cover">Blacks and High Steel</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Dilberger, American Renaissance, June 2006</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the late 1960s, I came back from Vietnam, once again to take up my chosen profession as a &#8220;connector&#8221; in the high steel trade. I was a member of the ironworkers union, the men who build the steel frames for multi-story buildings. I worked on many Manhattan skyscrapers, on jobs that changed the city&rsquo;s skyline.</p>
<p>I was born in 1943  &mdash;  I am not a baby boomer  &mdash;  and started my career before the days of affirmation action. I was taught by men who made their mark in the 1930s, and absorbed standards of excellence from them, along with the belief that there was no excuse for sub-par work. I have had a close look at how things have changed. I consider myself an American patriot, and as a white man, I think people should know what lowered standards have done to my profession.</p>
<p>At my first union meeting back from Vietnam, the main question was whether black men should be allowed in the local union. All the older men, including the leadership, were against letting blacks in, while we younger men were for it. As a veteran, I thought it only right for blacks, with whom I served in combat, to get a shot like anyone else. The debates were furious, but on its own, my union would not have admitted blacks. In the early 1970s, a court order ended the debate. Judges ordered all the trades to let blacks take the apprentice tests.</p>
<p>At that time, my union was mainly &#8220;father/son,&#8221; meaning that if your father or another close relative was a member, you&rsquo;d get a shot at the work. However, this didn&rsquo;t guarantee membership in the local. You still had to pass the apprentice test and measure up on the job. Nor did it mean that men who didn&rsquo;t have family in the business never got a chance. They could take the test, and if they were good they could join the union.</p>
<p>At that time, the apprentice tests were hard. There were three parts  &mdash;  physical, mental and psychological  &mdash;  and failure on any part meant disqualification. The test was given every three years, and if a man failed, he was out of luck. He had to wait for the next test. There was also an age limit of 29. Anyone older than that had to find another line of work.</p>
<p>Although there were no blacks in the union, it was not segregated. It was about 60 percent white, and the rest were American Indians. Indians had to take the test and measure up just like everyone else.</p>
<p>When black men first took the apprentice test, they all failed  &mdash;  every one. You can imagine the laughter of the older members of the local. However, soon after, their laughter was silenced, again by court order. A judge ruled that although the test had been overseen by the state, the results were not satisfactory, and there had to be another way to get blacks into the union. Every trade had plans like this, and ours was called the &#8220;trainee program.&#8221; It was open only to blacks, but did not have an age limit. Blacks could still take the union apprentice test, but if they failed, as the overwhelming majority did, they got in through the &#8220;trainee program.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a reason the union had an apprentice test: it weeded out people who could not do the work. But the test was not perfect, either, and there were men who could pass it but were still not up to the job. Think for a moment what it means to build a steel frame. As the frame goes up, every time a beam is set onto a column, two pieces of steel meet in thin air. It&rsquo;s windy up there, and frames tend to sway without walls to stiffen them. A &#8220;connector&#8221; has to be at the top of that column, ready to pin the beam to it  &mdash;  and he may be 30 floors above the street. The work is simple to understand, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it easy. It is dirty, difficult and dangerous, and it takes a very determined man to do it. There are no gray areas. The reality of the work hits a man like a baseball bat each day. He can either do it or he can&rsquo;t. Many men never have to be told to leave; they willingly leave the trade, and this includes quite a few who are relatives of members. There are other, less demanding jobs in a &#8220;raising gang,&#8221; but capable men will generally spend a good part of their career as connectors.</p>
<p>When black men started filtering on to the job, it was clear from the beginning they had no ability to do the work. For the most part, they were so obviously incapable, many left immediately. The usual practice with a man who clearly wasn&rsquo;t up to the work was to give him two hours pay and fire him, but it was different for blacks even in that respect. They stayed below for the day with the older men in the detail gangs, and were fired only when they came down off the building at the end of the work day. Before long, it became impossible to fire any but the very worst. Courts mandated that a certain percentage of the workforce, especially on government jobs, be made up of black men.</p>
<p>To understand the effect of forcing inadequate men into a profession, it is important to know something about the work. A raising gang has a foreman or pusher, and men with four different specialties. The hooker-on physically puts the steel wire slings, or chokers, around the beams, girders, columns, etc., that are going to be raised by the crane for the connectors to set. He must know all the different capacities of the chokers he&rsquo;s using, so as not to put a choker on a piece if it is not rated for that weight. He also unofficially runs the gang, because he sets the sequence for the pieces of steel that go up to the connecters. A tagline man then uses ropes with hooks spliced into their ends to guide the beams up to the connectors. If one of the beams he&rsquo;s guiding snags on a beam that&rsquo;s already set, he must signal the crane operator (who is not an ironworker) to slack off the load so the tagline man can clear the piece. Then he directs the crane to continue raising the piece. The tagline man is usually the youngest man in the gang and is being groomed to be a connecter. He must be in excellent shape, since he may be asked to go connecting at any time. The signal man communicates with the crane operator. Sometimes he will use hand signals, and at other times there is a &#8220;phone system&#8221; hooked up to the cab of the crane. The signal man must be alert all the time because the unexpected can always happen. A good signalman can save a man&rsquo;s life, and a bad one who doesn&rsquo;t pay attention can cause all sorts of trouble. He is usually the oldest man in the gang, and is considered something of a sage.</p>
<p>At the very top of the building are the connectors. I consider connecting to be an art within the trade, and it is widely recognized as the most dangerous and demanding work. The job takes a special combination of mental and physical abilities, along with great strength and agility. The connector must not only anticipate the flow of the work and the motions of a beam swinging at the end of a cable, he may have to climb straight up a 30-foot column with as much as 50 pounds of equipment in a work belt hanging from his waist. These are bolts and pins of various lengths and diameters with which he sets the steel, along with the other tools he has to use. Connecting takes a certain physical type. A man may be a weight lifter, but if he has given up too much mobility with all that bulk, he is no more use than a man who is overweight. There are always two connectors working together, and they must have complete confidence in each other. Men who work well together may stay together for years. Not everyone can do this work, and a man who makes his mark as a connector is due a certain respect not given to others, even after he moves on to less demanding jobs.</p>
<p>There is a limit to how long a man can connect steel. At some point his body won&rsquo;t take the beating anymore, and his abilities slip. He still knows what to do, but his reactions aren&rsquo;t there anymore. Some men connect steel into their sixties, but not many. One I knew was also a walker. He would walk about seven miles from Brooklyn into Manhattan  &mdash;  across the Brooklyn bridge  &mdash;  do a day&rsquo;s work and walk home.</p>
<p>Anyway, these are the men in the raising gang, and they work under the supervision of a pusher. If he&rsquo;s a good pusher, he&rsquo;ll get good men working for him, and he will keep them from job to job. When the gang is working well, the lighter his touch on the gang the better. A good gang will almost function on its own.</p>
<p>The next gang on a job is the bolt-up gang. These are usually men who used to be in a raising gang or who, for some reason, could not function on one. They come along after the raising gang and put in the final bolts to hold the steel. Most of the time the bolt-up gangs do not need strong young men, but there can be exceptions. Sometimes a point (where columns and beams join) may require 100 bolts that must be torqued with a heavy impact gun. The gang will have as many apprentices as it needs to keep the gang supplied with bolts and tools. Needless to say, the worst apprentice is the one who gets the coffee.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the detail gang. These people come along later to weld the larger bolts, clean up mistakes, and take care of any changes that come up during a job. This work is easier and more slow-paced than raising and bolting up steel.</p>
<p>For those who have never worked in a union, perhaps this description is enough to make it clear that the union really was a brotherhood. When you work together for years with people whose abilities you count on not only to do your job but for your physical safety, you develop close attachments. At the same time, the best ironworkers love what they do. There is immense satisfaction in seeing a building go up, in doing a challenging job most men can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>When blacks started coming into the business, I was still young and making a name as a connector. The job requires total focus, so when you&rsquo;re 40 floors above the street, you don&rsquo;t have time to think about what some black guy is doing or not doing in a detail gang down below. Although I was aware of what foremen were saying about the overall inability of black men to do the work, I never saw them. They seemed instinctively to know they could not work in a raising gang. I wasn&rsquo;t fully aware of the overall damage they were doing the industry until I finished my years of connecting, and started pushing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to describe exactly what keeps them from being able to do the more difficult raising-gang work. They are not particularly afraid of heights. Blacks will go out on the iron, way above the street, but only at a very slow, measured pace they can control. They don&rsquo;t adjust well to fast-paced work.</p>
<p>Blacks have similar problems with rigging (the work of putting the right cables on the steel pieces and sending them up). Rigging is an integral part of getting the steel where it is has to go. Ironworkers must know all the different capacities of steel cable, and how to use a particular size cable in a way that increases its capacity. For some reason, this is something blacks do not seem to pick up. The same is true with knotcraft. All men in the trade must know certain knots and how to splice. I don&rsquo;t know why, but blacks don&rsquo;t seem to get the hang of it. Their abilities to see things before they happen don&rsquo;t seem to be well developed, and don&rsquo;t improve as they gain experience (though as far as the raising gang is concerned, they don&rsquo;t stay around long enough to get much experience anyway).</p>
<p>Finally, blacks do not read blueprints well. That is why there are so few black pushers even after all these years. It&rsquo;s hard to cover for a guy who can&rsquo;t read a blueprint. When I taught blueprint reading in the apprentice school, I was able to get it across to the white and Indian guys but not to blacks. When I was in the service, I tried to teach a black guy to read a map and use a compass. Either I wasn&rsquo;t a good teacher, or he wasn&rsquo;t a good student, because after I was finished, he couldn&rsquo;t do either.</p>
<p>This is not to say that <em>no blacks</em> can do the work. As in so many other situations, there is the rare exception that proves the rule. I have seen only one black man who could do the work the way it&rsquo;s supposed to be done. He was a good man in every way. Unfortunately, he got killed in 1980 when he fell to his death. Nobody knew what made him fall. It was just one of those things.</p>
<p>When I started pushing, the very first gang I took was a bolt-up gang with two blacks. It was apparent very quickly that they were not up to the job. This was early in the work on a 50-story building in Manhattan, and I could not afford to be stuck with men who could not pull their weight. I got hold of the steward and told him to do something or I was going to fire them. He told me they were going to start a detail gang (easier, less demanding work) in a couple of days, and would take the blacks off my hands. In their place, I got two decent guys.</p>
<p>Some people will tell you blacks are lazy, but I think a better word for it is childlike. If a pusher gives them a task and leaves, they will sit down because they&rsquo;re not being watched. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to register with them that when the pusher comes back he will see that the work has not been done  &mdash;  until they see him coming. Then they will invent some silly excuse for why the work is not done. Obviously, it&rsquo;s risky for a pusher to pair two blacks to work together. The usual thing is to put a black guy with a white or an Indian, but the Indians absolutely hate to work with blacks, and if you insist, they may walk off the job. With a mixed pair, the white or Indian guy has to do all the thinking and most of the work.</p>
<p>I know it runs counter to the common view, but generally speaking, I&rsquo;m not impressed with the strength or stamina of blacks. I&rsquo;m sure many people will find this hard to understand, but blacks just give out sooner.</p>
<p>Late in my career, I was pushing a detail gang that was setting some small beams. A black guy said we should take a rest every time we set a piece, but it was light work and I kept the men going. During coffee break he told me I was a slave driver. I told him that if he were the slave and I were the master, I&rsquo;d have to go out and get a job to support us both because he wasn&rsquo;t doing enough to make owning him pay. I suppose you could get fired for saying that today.</p>
<p>There are other problems with blacks. They tend to come to work late, and without the proper tools or clothing. When I was a walking boss on a job, I&rsquo;d be down in the street sometimes watching the connectors unload steel off a truck shortly after seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning (the start time for work in the trades), and I&rsquo;d see black guys coming late from all directions. That includes all the trades, not just ironworkers.</p>
<p>Some of the excuses I have heard are incredible: &#8220;I lent my alarm clock to a friend and he forgot to call me and wake me up and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m late.&#8221; Or this one: &#8220;I was on time but a cop gave me a ticket on the train for smoking, and he wouldn&rsquo;t let me off at my stop and I had to wait for a train going back the other way and was finally able to get off.&#8221; Then there are the guys who claim to have had deaths in the family, but who forget, and claim multiple deaths for the same person.</p>
<p>Blacks are also likely to have a different kind of baggage. I had a black guy on a job who wasn&rsquo;t bad. He could do a fair job of bolting up, and seemed to be good at being on time for work and doing what he was supposed to do when he was there. Then, all of a sudden, he sticks up a fast food joint and that&rsquo;s the end of him. He got five years. What good was he to the brotherhood?</p>
<p>Certain contracts (usually city, state and federal) now stipulate that the work crew has to have certain percentages of minorities. Also, on many public projects, a certain amount of the contract is set aside for minority contractors. This means large outfits have created dummy minority companies so they can get the minority contract, too. I&rsquo;ve seen only one genuinely black outfit get one of these contracts, and they made a mess of things and were thrown off the job.</p>
<p>The fact that blacks would or could not do the hardest work had an effect no one outside the trade would have anticipated. It meant that instead of starting in a raising gang, they started in detail work or bolting up  &mdash;  work that older men traditionally did. If it was a government job that required a certain number of blacks, you had to put those men to work somewhere. Many times, it meant older men who had been in the trade for years  &mdash;  some nearing retirement age  &mdash;  had to go back and do the work of younger men. You can imagine the snowball effect. By their very presence, blacks upset the rhythm and flow of work.</p>
<p>The courts pushed women into the trade, too, just as they had blacks. Of course, they don&rsquo;t have the upper body strength to do the work, but in our unfortunate country, that makes no difference. They&rsquo;re in now, and that&rsquo;s that. They&rsquo;ve caused untold problems on the jobs.</p>
<p>The curious thing is that 90 percent of the women who have come into the trade are black, so you have all the other problems I have mentioned plus the fact that they are not strong enough. Once again, we had a group without any ability to do anything but the easiest work.</p>
<p>I had a problem myself with a woman, soon after they started showing up. I was working as a bolt-up pusher and asked for another apprentice. We were adding journeymen, so I needed another hand to service them. The union hall sent me a woman. She proceeded to tell me she was going to get the coffee. I told her I was the one who made those decisions, and she wasn&rsquo;t going to get the coffee. I had the original apprentice getting coffee, and that was the way it was going to be. I told her to do ordinary apprentice work, and she just left the floor and told the job super I had harassed her. I told him it was a bunch of baloney, and he put her on a detail gang. I wanted her fired, but that wasn&rsquo;t going to happen. She went on to cause more problems. Last I heard of her, I think she got killed, but not on the job.</p>
<p>I once asked an old timer who had worked in the Brooklyn Navy Yard during the war about the work the women did there. He told me they were good welders (welding is easy work). However, men had to put up the scaffolds for them, so they could get to where the welding had to be done. The situation was much the same as what we&rsquo;re experiencing with women today.</p>
<p>Ours has always been dangerous work. I&rsquo;ve been hurt, myself. In 1980, a floor I was on collapsed out from under me, and I fell 35 feet onto Houston Street in Manhattan. I broke my arm. I rehabbed myself and was back at work about three and a half months later, much to the chagrin of my lawyer, who wanted me to stay out of work for as long as my case lasted, which was four years. I got some money, but nothing compared to what I could have gotten if I had stayed out all that time. I wasn&rsquo;t going to sit around for four years.</p>
<p>For the most part, women and blacks don&rsquo;t get hurt. Mainly, it&rsquo;s because they won&rsquo;t do the dangerous work, nor will anyone put them in a critical position where a man&rsquo;s life could depend on them. There has been a blizzard of new safety regulations that are supposed to remove a lot of the dangers, but there are as many injuries as before, and mostly it is whites who get hurt. Why? Because the ironworkers test has been completely watered down to create the illusion that blacks and women are &#8220;passing.&#8221; That means inferior white men are passing the test and entering the trade  &mdash;  and doing the critical work  &mdash;  and inferior men always find a way to get hurt.</p>
<p><b>Breaking Up the Brotherhood</b></p>
<p>Structural ironworking is wonderful work for a man who can throw himself into it. The challenges and rewards of the job bring out incredible emotions. The bonds you build with men you can trust last a lifetime. This is why union men call each other brothers, and back in the father-to-son days, men were often related to each other, too.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest tragedy of blacks on high steel is that they have never become part of the brotherhood. They have maintained a <i>de facto</i> segregation that has kept them from fully taking part in the trade, and have established themselves as a separate entity within the local. They have refused every overture of brotherhood from members such as myself, who were their friends from the beginning. They have refused friendship from the Indian brothers, too. Mainly this happened because they were artificially inserted into work for which they were completely unqualified. Now, even after all these years, they are just as outside the flow of the work as the day they started. All this time, no black has ever won elected office in the local.</p>
<p>Many of the blacks have a chip-on-the-shoulder attitude about the job and about whites. In my opinion, they strike a pose to hide the fact that they don&rsquo;t have what it takes as a group to do the work. I can&rsquo;t imagine what their day must be like, always walking around wondering if someone doesn&rsquo;t like them, never able to lose themselves in the work. This work has so much to offer, but it&rsquo;s up to each man to get out of it what he can.</p>
<p>I mentioned the incredible emotions of high steel, but the key to feeling those emotions is the work. If a man won&rsquo;t throw himself completely into the work, he&rsquo;ll always be on the outside looking in. He will end caring about the money rather than the work. For him it&rsquo;s about the money, and only the money. Blacks were thrown into a job they couldn&rsquo;t handle, but they made choices, too. They chose to stay on the outside, and the loss is theirs.</p>
<p>When affirmative action started, nobody thought it would move beyond the blue-collar jobs. Many white-collar workers thought it was fine for people who work outside to integrate. After all, they thought, what does it take to do that kind of work? Just brawn and no brains. They didn&rsquo;t understand that their turn would come.</p>
<p>Now, everybody sees what has happened. We as white people, must act together and do what has to be done to end this plague of affirmative action. I don&rsquo;t know how it will happen, but I believe there has already been a change in thinking in America. People are fed up with all this nonsense and slowly they will first take back the workplace and then their society.<br>

			<p>Speaking of blacks being childlike,there are 3 black men that I work with and they are absolutley terrified of spiders,ants and snakes,one time a coworker of mine had to rescue one from a spider that was holding him hostage,another time another one had a rubber snake put on his shoulder and he jumped 15 feet and screamed at the top of his lungs,the third one had a giant plastic ant placed on his shoulder and he ran screaming from the room can you believe I am talking about adults ??.</p>

			<p>I completely agree with this article. I am a &#8216;jack of all trades&rsquo;. I have done all sorts of work in my life and with all sorts of people. Working with blacks was in every single case in every single job the worst of all. Working with blacks - the only area of my life where I interact with them because I have no choice - has been among the most unrewarding experiences of my life. Blacks made the simplest tasks a burden and just POISONED the whole work environment with their hostility, laziness and lack of professionalism. I worked in construction jobs and have lots of friends who do to. They all agree that blacks are the last thing you want on your work crews. I once had one friend in the construction trade (he was a drywaller) point out to me four condos being built. He pointed to one condo and said it would be the last one built and have the most problems and delays. I asked him how he knew this? He said there were too many blacks on the project. I noticed that was the case. That particular building had considerably more blacks then the other three (it was a different construction company). Sure enough all three of the other condos were up about a year earlier then that one was.</p>

			<p>C&rsquo;mon, who are we to believe? some white guy with years of experience doing the actual work or a Harvard educated lawyer working for the dept. of labor? no doubt the lawyer has seen a building under construction and if he determines that unqualified people can do the job then that&rsquo;s good enough for me. </p>
<p>For anyone who doesn&rsquo;t think this man&rsquo;s experience translates to other areas, read the saga of Drew medical center in Los Angeles, just change the cast of characters and the decade and the story is exactly the same</p>

			<p>Manufacturing dealt with this by hiring mostly through temp agencies. In a sense punishing everyone. You have to work for a company through a temp agency, as a second class citizen, for at least 6 months before the company will consider hiring you in the companies name. It&rsquo;s mostly psychological, but it gives more power and prestige to the employer. </p>

			<p>I have had the same experience. I was bailing hay in june/july of august in Georgia a few years back. These bails weighed about 70lbs, not too heavy but you have to understand that to bail hay it has to be 95 degrees so that the hay dries and will not mildew when it is packed together. Well you do hat a couple hundred times a day and it can get a wee bit tiring.</p>
<p>On one such day, a black male came out to work with us. He was about 6&rsquo;2&#8221; give or take and easily over 200lbs. Suffice to say he was a big guy who was probably fairly strong&hellip;.but work ethic wise&hellip;there was nothing.</p>
<p>I am about 5&rsquo;7&#8221; 150lbs, not a big guy by most people standards. But I did this work all day (usually 11ish to 6-7) for a few days a week everytime the work came up. This guy worked one halfday and simply walked off the job. Very clearly upset at the amount of work required for 8 bucks an hour.</p>

			<p>This article mirrors my experiences in the industry  &mdash;  especially the &#8220;baggage&#8221; part.  Blacks could never get their act together and rarely made it past first year apprentice.  I was a project / construction manager for a large window company in a large US city and all my men had to do was show up at the job site and slap in windows for new subdivisions in the sprawling burbs.  Basically, all they really needed to do was show up on time and manage to make it through the day in robot mode  &mdash;  there was little skill or thinking involved, as myself and the journeymen did all we could to dumb it down for them.  But they still couldn&rsquo;t handle it and I had to fire dozens of them, since the nearest union halls were in &#8220;ghetto&#8221; areas and the people they sent me were a reflection of the local populations.  And it&rsquo;s not like they were all total idiots, either  &mdash;  some of those guys were good workers (when they worked!), but it was always something like &#8220;I got arrested for beating my woman!&#8221; or &#8220;I lost my license for a DUI!&#8221; or &#8220;My car broke down!&#8221; or &#8220;I&rsquo;m in jail for child support!&#8221; or &#8220;I got drunk last night!&#8221; and on and on and on. I couldn&rsquo;t keep people on who weren&rsquo;t reliable  &mdash;  I had to hold my schedules and those of my customers.  Those guys really wanted to succeed in their own dumbass way, but their personal lives were screwed up to the point where they couldn&rsquo;t even maintain employment. </p>
<p>Some of those ghetto dwellers used to show up for interviews and the ID&rsquo;s they&rsquo;d provide didn&rsquo;t even look them in the slightest and I had to wonder how they got in the system in the first place. Needless to say, I wouldn&rsquo;t take them on.  A few didn&rsquo;t take too kindly to getting fired, either, and I was always keeping an eye on who was parking outside the trailer, if you know what I mean! I&rsquo;ve seen literally hundreds of journeyman carpenters over the years on countless job sites but I don&rsquo;t think I even encountered a dozen who were black  &mdash;  generally only whites and Mexicans have the discipline to stick with it.</p>

			<p>The author of this article is a man that we can all admire and emulate.  He is a good example of why whites historically have been so successful wherever they go.  He exemplifies the white virtues of hard work and know how.  Our culture is being destroyed.  We should teach younger whites the values and traditions of white culture.  Talk to them.  Showing them this article, for example, would show them how to think and act.  </p>

<p>As M. Dumpty explained about two weeks ago  &mdash;  blacks are terrified of anything resembling voo-doo or witch craft  &mdash;  skeletons, spiders, snakes, etc  &mdash;  and will steer clear of them by a mile or go apoplectic upon the sight of them.</p>
<p>After reading Dumpty&rsquo;s post I now understand why Third Worlders cross the street before they reach my house as I&rsquo;ve left up some of the Halloween decorations from last October  &mdash;  gargoyles, skulls, rubber human bones, blacks cats are incorporated into the landscaping of my front yard, never again to be taken down.</p>
<p>In fact, this holiday weekend I&rsquo;m looking forward to adding to my collection  &mdash;  a new goth-type store opened in my town and I thought I might be able to find a few new decorations for my yard, perhaps a large black pot, the type used to shrink heads in the &#8216;old country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My advice to you, Todd, is to be very very careful scaring blacks by planting rubber spiders, etc. around their desks and placing such things on their shoulders.  While funny to watch, you are playing with fire.</p>
<p>You will be called in by HR and find yourself accused of &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo; and &#8216;racial intimidation&rsquo;.  Remember:  Lots of blacks are keenly aware of the ghetto lottery and will see this as an opportunity to collect a lot of money, become heroes in the black community for standing up to The Man, never have to work again, and as a bonus, cost a White man his job and reputation.   The street cred alone is worth it to these types.</p>
<p>He will call up the EEOC, $PLC, NAACP, ACLU and the ADL and they will eagerly jump to the blacks&rsquo; defense (by this time, all of the blacks will have joined in with their own stories of White intimidation).  Your company will happily throw you to the high-powered lawyers and law enforcement agencies including the FBI, lest these intimidation groups tip off the Justice Department to scrutinize, rip apart and levy enormous fines against the entire business.   <br>
  <br>
The msm will pick up the story, place it on the front page above the fold, your White face will plastered all over and you will be branded &#8216;racist&rsquo; and &#8216;hater.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No matter what you do or say, forgiveness will not be forthcoming.</p>
<p>You will not win.</p>

			<p>Aside from the racial observations, most of which I agree with, I&rsquo;d like to salute this man on Memorial Day, first for his service in Nam and secondly for his career as a connector. I was briefly a member of Local 580 in NY City, as were my brothers, father,grandfather,  uncles and assorted in laws. Overall, our greatest respect was for the connectors in either local 40 or 361&hellip;.. everything this man said about their abilities is true. <br>
Many happy returns to you sir, on this special holiday.</p>

			<p>This is excellent writing from the kind of skilled workmen that have made America so strong &amp; capable. Intelligent &amp; perceptive pieces like this, of course, cannot be published except in venues like AR so thank God for AR.  </p>
<p>I was struck by his observation: </p>
<p><i> &#8220;Some people will tell you blacks are lazy, but I think a better word for it is childlike.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This has been my sense of them and he might have added &#8220;improvident&#8221; by his own descriptions of their lack of foresight. These characteristics have been often observed before and blacks are aware of this perception of them and there is plenty of literature attempting to rationalize this has just racism (search engine &#8220;black childlike&#8221;). I&rsquo;d like to know of psychological studies on this question but I&rsquo;m afraid some scientific investigations are taboo precisely because of what the results might be.</p>

			<p>These situations are not just true in the construction industry.  They apply to mostly all professions.</p>
<p>I had the unfortunate bad luck to have a Black woman sales manager for some time.  The company I worked for was started by an ultra-liberal White guy and he gave her full run of the place so-to-speak.  The managers she hired were all Black and Hispanic and she made race an issue whenever she could.  Some of us could not believe what we were hearing much of the time.  She was lazy and didn&rsquo;t do anything that she didn&rsquo;t need to do.  She knew not a thing about sales or the sales environment.  Her position took no skill, no savvy, no intelligence and it was infuriating as a White person to work with her.  The Blacks and Hispanics under her were just as arrogant and acted like it was their natural right to step on people-especially White ones.  They were mostly overweight as well.  Most low to mid-level local, state and federal jobs have been taken by Blacks and Hispanics in the last 30 years.  They have literally pushed Whites out not only with affirmative action, but just due to the fact that Whites do not want to work with these people because of their hostility, arrogance, laziness and their collective feelings of entitlement, especially where Whites are concerned.  This is a main cause of the downturn in the economy.  How long can a country&rsquo;s economy tolerate the lack of quality that Blacks bring to a job - any job?  How long can Whites tolerate the injustices that have been perpetrated on them with things like affirmative action hiring that gives jobs to unqualified non-Whites over qualified Whites?</p>

			<p>This article is so true on so many levels. As you read it you can feel the pride of &#8220;doing a good days work&#8221;, if it is dangerous, so what? If it requires you to learn special skills, then learn them. Feel proud of how you support your family, your trade and your community in doing a good job. I am in electrical construction and I can tell you all the same issues with blacks occur, although I have known a couple of very capable black electricians, but for most of them the studying is too hard, it is too hard to turn up on time, they will take as long as they can to do a piece of work, they will sit around and wait to be told what to do next even when it has already been explained. Finally, they are hopeless at looking at plans and turning those plans into reality. Many of these criticsms also apply to the white guys we get now, it almost seems that many of our young people are turning black!</p>

As many have noted, the observations in this piece regarding high steel are just as readily seen in any business which employs blacks. As I say, <b>black behavior is universal</b> (as is the outcome).</p>
<p>AR ran a few issues with similar personal perspectives from white men and women dealing with blacks and how it has made them racially aware. I&rsquo;d like to see AR solicit and publish such articles periodically.</p>
<p>While I greatly appreciate the scholarly research presented by AR, such works can sometimes be obtuse and abstract for a broad audience. Sharing our common experiences let&rsquo;s other whites know they&rsquo;re not alone in how they have come to see blacks as they are. A good &#8216;man in the trenches&rsquo; piece once in awhile would help others speak out as well.<br>

			<p>I hope that the poor performance of blacks in the construction industry does not cause buildings to collapse!  I live on the top floor of an urban high-rise apartment!</p>
<p>In the spring of 1977, I took an anthropology course on American Indians, The course covered historical anthropology before and after the coming of the white man.  Then toward the end of the course, modern-day Indians was covered.  I learned that the Mohawks and other Eastern tribes traditionally work in construction.  So it is obvious that American Indians, along with whites, are better suited for construction work than blacks.</p>
<p>Later, in the summer of 1977, I worked for a corrugated box factory.  At lunch, I discussed the course I took on American Indian anthropology with my co-workers.  One co-worker, Bob, told me of a Mohawk Indian he knew, who hated blacks.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the poor performance of blacks in the construction industry, that is one the factors as to why modern-day Eastern Indian tribes do not like blacks.</p>

     I believe that too many of the young Whites that ought be in the skilled trades are in college getting some worthless degree.  Smart young men have been taught that real work is for dummies, rednecks, and otherwise uncool people, and so employers have to fill those jobs with guys of any color, guys that in an honest world would be no more than laborers and helpers.  Remember, one out of six Whites is no smarter than the average Black, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that their behavior tends to follow the Black example.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in lowering standards. If a black is up to the job, ok fine but it should never be given to people because of affirmative action. I have known some blacks who are easy to work with and did a good job and some whites who are lazy and difficult. However, overall I have found that a much higher rate of blacks do lousy work. I find that whites as well as orientals do much better.</p>

			<p>The statements made in this article translate to any field in which blacks work, white collar, blue collar, whatever. Anybody who works with blacks has seen the truth with their own eyes. Not too long ago, a black who worked in the same facility as I, was drinking liquor on the train bringing him to work. Once he emptied the bottle, he attempted to ..refill it, if you know what I mean, being as this was a SEPTA local and had no onboard toilet. Once dropped off, it is about a 10 minute walk to the plant. He ended up being pulled out of a water-filled drainage ditch 4 hours later, by a white man, suffering from hypothermia. The best part is that as he laid there, he was passed by other blacks leaving, heading to catch the train taking them back to the city.</p>

That is so true.  More intelligence is needed in the trades.  The trades should not be disparaged. We need more good carpenters and cooks and fewer half-rate sociologists.  </p>
<p>When I am in another country, such as Switzerland, I always study the little architectural details and am invariably  impressed by the high quality of the work.   In the Third World, I notice the exact opposite   &mdash;    the conspicuous lack of quality.  Having done some amateur fix-up work myself, I take a particular interest in such details and can appreciate the labor and care that went into the job:  the air-tight snugness of the windows, the perfect fit of the doors, the  functionality of the plumbing,  the electricity, the tiling, the wallpapering &hellip; I notice them all.  Was the painting neatly done, with paint carefully applied;  or was it a sloppy paint job with paint splattered all over?  Sometimes I even take off the switchplates and look inside to see how the wiring was done. </p>
<p>Third World workmanship produces slapjack work: windows that don&rsquo;t shut, toilets that don&rsquo;t flush, sinks that drip onto the floor, tiles that wobble under your feet.  Countries that have  <i>a tradition of high craftsmanship  </i>produce high quality work, which is a pleasure to observe for those able to recognize it.  </p>
<p>On further thought, it only figures that <i><b>the quality of the job done is merely a reflection of the quality of the  labor that went into it.</b></i>  And it shows!   Increasingly, I regret to say, the USA is producing third-rate workmanship, which reveals who is doing it.  If it looks like Mexico, it&rsquo;s probably been done by a Mexican. </p>

However, excelence seems optional with a lot of blacks. I have met some great individuals of color who were motivated to do good work and were not weighted down with personal issues. But early in my proffesional life i learned that if i did not do my best, i would be unceremoniously fired. It is more complicated with African-Americans. It can really damage your career to treat them equaly.</p>

			<p>I am now 62 and on disability retirement.  Throughout my life, whatever the job, wherever I was, blacks were just frankly the dumbest in the job, with the worst attitudes, and the characterization as &#8220;childlike&#8221; is right on.  Childlike in the sense of intelligence, behavior, expectations for themselves, and pitching a fit if they didn&rsquo;t get their way.  Didn&rsquo;t matter if it was in the military, government service, the private sector, professional jobs, services jobs, or whatever.  Always the same.  Blacks just could NOT compete with the white man, even in positions that required college degrees.  Especially in jobs that were technical and required college degrees. They could not adapt, they could not learn as quickly, some things they could not learn at all.  Yet, they wanted to be treated as if they could, and demanded they be put in jobs that clearly overwhelmed them, and they simply could NOT do.  Once they obtained the jobs, through affirmative action or some other non-competitive means, they quickly became overwhelmed.  That bred one of two responses: panic and hostility, or ducking responsibilities by joking, yakking, socializing, disappearing, or pretending to be working while accomplishing nothing at all.<br>
If they were made to produce, the feeling of being overwhelmed and not having a clue made them get nasty and even threaten violence.  If left alone, they skated.  When they did try to actually do something, it was sloppy and wrong, requiring a competent white man to re-do it and correct it.  Didn&rsquo;t matter if it was an office job, technical job, military service, whatever.  Over a lifetime of working different jobs and levels of responsiblity, this has been the case.  One example, of MANY was during a government position on a team that reviewed industrial operations to streamline them and make them more efficient.  A lot of math ability, ability to analyse and coherently produce written evaluations, and the ability to then explain these conclusions concisely to intelligent managers with a stake in the outcome was required.  We had ONE black on the team.  A college graduate like the rest of us.  Went through the same training we all did.  He never got it.  He was constantly overwhelmed.  Constantly asking questions on how we did this or how we did that; why we did this or why we chose to do that; how would we run this calculation, or how did we come up with that result; and forget being able to express himself in writing.  Even though &#8220;educated&#8221; and holding a college degree he wrote in ebonics and ghetto language.  The guy was clearly panicking and overwhelmed because he was expected to produce just as we were.  Frankly, he was completely unable to do the job, and completely lacking in the intelligence to do it.<br>
Our supervisor had me rewriting his work on a regular basis trying to fix the computations and analysis, and write it up in proper english.  One time, while trying to brief my supervisor on site at a location, this guy kept following us around as I was trying to tell my supervisor what I&rsquo;d done, and what I&rsquo;d found, and what methodology I was using.  He kept interrupting asking stupid questions (trying to discover from our talk what HIS methodology should be and how to do HIS job).  The supervisor kept walking away from him so we could talk without interruption but he kept following us around interrupting anyway.  When I was done briefing the supervisor, this bozo - completely overwhelmed by the job and frustrated that he could not eavesdrop and learn what he was supposed to do, threatened to throw me over a railing onto a concrete floor 30 feet below if I ever &#8220;ignored&#8221; him again.  Forget the fact that it was the SUPERVISOR trying to get away from him, and in order to continue the brief, I had to follow the supervisor.  Forget the fact that up until then I had more or less willingly helped him whenever told to do so, or he&rsquo;d asked for my help.  None of that mattered.  He was in a panic, he turned violent.</p>
<p>From that day on I refused to help him, refused to work on any team he was on, and informed my supervisor what happened and NEVER to give ME his work to review and correct ever again.  </p>
<p>One example of many.  The outcome of this story?  He was the FIRST one promoted to a higher grade.  And, ultimately, he became CHIEF of the whole shebang.  Out of all the competent and even excellent engineers in that job, he was totally incompetent, and HE was the first one promoted.  I left that agency and joined another, happily to advance over the years, and happy in the job.  But then, there were NO blacks in that agency in the entire time I was in it.  Which made all the difference.  They are just trouble wherever they are.  </p>

			<p>So we&rsquo;ve had about thirty five years of government interference in the very industries which had come to define America.  Just imagine how far we would have come, as a nation, in those thirty-five years, had the government simply left these competent heroes alone.</p>
<p>Just as the oil industry in this country has been invaded by all-Chinese exploration/drilling crews, you can bet that government interference with the construction industry has opened the doors to all-Hispanic and all-Chinese construction crews.  It seems fine to segregate, as long as it&rsquo;s not whites who are doing the segregating.</p>

<p>That is hardly an earth-shattering revelation when you consider the fact that American Indians, who on average live in more impoverished condidtions than American blacks, still consistently outscore them on IQ tests.  (source:  American Renaissance, Dec. &#8216;90)</p>

<p>More likely it is because they have always disliked them.  Most blacks don&rsquo;t like to admit it (though some of them have), but antipathy towards blacks appears to be ubiquitous among human populations.  Given their notoriously (and well-documented) low-IQs, plus their propensities towards indolence and other anti-social behaviors, this is hardly a surprise.</p>
<p>Gypsies are another group that excite similar high feelings among their fellow man, for basically the same reasons.</p>
