<h1>Rape Is Effective Weapon of War, US Senators Told</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William C. Mann, AP, May 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hundreds of thousands of women, girls and babies have been raped during 12 years of conflict in eastern Congo, victims of a weapon of war that almost always goes unpunished, senators were told Wednesday.</p>
<p>Similar atrocities are occurring in Darfur, the devastated western Sudan region where the United States said in 2004 that genocide was occurring. Women also have been targeted on a wide scale in recent decades during wars in Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee heard testimony on the plight of women caught up in violence, emphasizing the Darfur and Congo disasters.</p>
<p>Melanne Verveer, the State Department&rsquo;s ambassador-at-large for global women&rsquo;s issues, said 1,100 rapes are reported every month in the Congo battle area, &#8220;which is 36 women and girls raped each day.&#8221; Many are maimed by their attackers as well, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rape is employed as a weapon because it is effective,&#8221; Verveer said. &#8220;It destroys the fabric of society from within and does so more efficiently than do guns or bombs.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said humanitarian organizations &#8220;report that attacks on women destroy the nucleus of the families, and with the unraveling families, the communities also disintegrate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To make matters worse, she said, she quoted a report by the Human Rights Integrated Office in Congo that spoke of &#8220;a marked lack of seriousness&#8221; by law officers and magistrates toward raped females.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men accused of rape are often granted bail or given light sentences,&#8221; Verveer said. &#8220;Few cases are reported to the police, and fewer still are in prosecution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verveer said that of the 14,000 rape cases registered in the Congo&rsquo;s provincial health centers in between 2005 and 2007, only 287 were taken to trial.</p>

		<p>Yes, folks, and it&rsquo;s happening here, too.  Here, and in Australia, and in the formerly &#8216;Great&rsquo; Britain, It&rsquo;s being referred to as &#8216;racial gangrape&rsquo;.  Brown/black men on white victims.</p>
<p>We need to seriously consider whether abortion should be illegal, even in the case of rape.  Would you want your daughter forced to bear the spawn of some black?</p>

		<p>No doubt, there is plenty of rape in these same regions of the world during peacetime as well. So the war adds&hellip;..what?&hellip;..a few more every day? </p>

		<p>&#8220;Rape is an effective weapon of war.&#8221; From this can we then infer that the extreme racial disproportion in rape vis-a-vis blacks and whites in the U.S. amounts to war by blacks against whites. One of those august senators should have asked Ms. Verveer that.</p>

		<p>I just phoned the United Nations in NYC and reported these rapes and killings.  The UN thanked me and told me they would take care of it and investigate.  The US Congress should get back to fixing the country and leave Police work to the United Nations professionals.</p>

		<p>Forget the Congo - what about here?  Rape by black men of white women is a weapon that has turned decent, safe, law-abiding white communities across America into seething black slums.  Rape is now being used by immigrant Africans (North and sub-Saharan) in Europe to displace and subjugate the native white populations there.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d love to see these white American women go to the Congo and waggle their fingers in the faces of the black Congolese soldiers, and tell them to stop raping black Congolese women; or they&rsquo;re going to be reported to the United Nations.</p>
<p>Funny how these women are as silent as Hannibal Lecter&rsquo;s lambs when it comes to the rape of male African pygmies by Congolese soldiers. I guess, to them, male on male rape isn&rsquo;t rape.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s seeeeeeeee, than makes 12,000 a year right! sort of below the mark of 37,000+ White women raped by blacks in the U.S. The good senators are not going to do anything about that though, it would be political suicide to say or do anything negative against the protected blacks.</p>

		<p>I could make a comment about the rape is a military tactic used by black men and their White, especially White feminazi enablers<br>
here in America, but I have posted it again and again.</p>
<p>Their is a war on White Americans.  It is being waged by blacks and their liberal White leaders like Tim Wise.  Rape is one of their well known tactics.  But I don&rsquo;t suppose the Senate, especially uber feminazis like Boxer and Feinstein want to hear about it. </p>

War it is and things will continue to deteriorate until Whites realize that it is War. Talk show host Bob Grant said at least 15 years ago that war has been declared against White people but they (Whites) have figured it out yet. <br>
Any White person today who hasn&rsquo;t yet armed himself/ herself is an idiot. You out there who are already armed, save your brass and learn to reload your own. Our government of &#8220;Change&#8221; is bent on depriving us of access to ammunition.</p>

		<p>Asian  (the current European euphemism for &#8220;muslim invaders&#8221; ) gangs in Sweden who have been robbing whites &amp; brutally raping a large number of white, Swedish women have also stated: &#8220;We are waging war with the Swedes.&#8221; (see: <a href="http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/938" rel="nofollow">http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/938</a> </p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t Sandra Bernhard say that she hoped Sarah Palin would be gang-raped by blacks? </p>
<p>Racial war is upon us already, complete with the likes of Bernhard to cheer on the victimization of whites.   Well, I have some hopes, too.  I hope that whites will realize just what is happening, find their backbone &amp; guts, and put a stop to it- right now!</p>

		<p>The psychology of the large scale black on white rape in the USA is based on their anti-white racial animus - it&rsquo;s part of their war:</p>
<p>ELDRIDGE CLEAVER (former Black Panther leader on why he raped white women) <b> &#8220;Rape was an insurrectionary act. It delighted me that I was defying and trampling upon the white man&rsquo;s law, upon his system of values, and that I was defiling his women.&#8221; </b> [Eldridge Cleaver, Soul on Ice, McGraw-Hill, 1968, p.14.]</p>
<p>The numbers:<br>
<b> In the United States in 2005, 37,460 white females were sexually assaulted or raped by a black man, while between zero and ten black females were sexually assaulted or raped by a white man. </b></p>
<p>What this means is that every day in the United States, over one hundred white women are raped or sexually assaulted by a black man. <br>

		<p>Not too long ago, I was on a chat site and talked with a person describing herself as a scholar on rape in the US.  I asked her what she made of the tremendous disbalance in interracial rape between blacks and whites.  She said that police reports were skewed.  When I pointed out that the National Crime Victimization Study is not based on &#8220;racist&#8221; police reports, she said she would not speak any further  on the subject until I provided a definiton of &#8220;rape&#8221; satisfactory to her.  Assuming she was in fact a specialist, I found it sobering that a professional white woman, the very group often victimized by black males, would be completely closed to any sort of deviation from the standard liturgy of wicked whites and downtrodden blacks.<br>

		<p>Given crime statistics rape seems to be the natural way for blacks. Maybe they are preferential as soldiers. It is a weapon of war that comes natural to them. No special training will be necessary.</p>

		<p>These &#8220;soldiers&#8221; are only raping black women because there are no White women to rape, White women being their preferred prey. In the U.S. of course, there is plenty of White prey.</p>

Posted by Soprano Fan </i></p>
<p>Well,  it isn&rsquo;t.  As I understand it.  I was once told by a NYC policeman whom I knew that  according to the legal definition of rape (and the law gets extremely explicit),  there is no such thing as male rape.  It is a legal impossiblity.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The numbers:  In the United States in 2005, 37,460 white females were sexually assaulted or raped by a black man, while between zero and ten black females were sexually assaulted or raped by a white man. <br>

<p>And of course, those are ONLY the reported cases.</p>

<p>Skewed?  I would like to know what she meant by that.  She demanded from you a definition of rape that was &#8220;satisfactory to her&#8221;(!).   You should have asked her for a definition of &#8220;skewed&#8221; that was satisfactory to you.</p>
<p>Of course, we do know that a Hispanic perpetrator raping a black female would be listed as a white upon black rape.  Perhaps that accounts for the  zero to ten statistic.</p>

		<p>Who exactly do you report to in Africa though? And the number of rapes in WAY more than what is reported. Many rapes go unreported because the women are killed during or after the process of rape, many times because of the use of weapons for rape.</p>
