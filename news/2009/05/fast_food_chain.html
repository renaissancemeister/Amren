<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Kentucky Fried Chicken is to launch a halal-only menu in eight of its London stores</p>
<p>Fast food giant Kentucky Fried Chicken is to launch a halal-only menu in eight of its London stores in a move which could be extended to other areas of the UK.</p>
<p>The menu, which will form part of a trial, will see the stores selling chicken products which have been fully approved by the Halal Food Authority for the first time.</p>
<p>KFC has 720 stores across the UK, and bosses said the move was designed to ensure the company was catering to a broader range of customers, following a growing demand for halal products.</p>
<p>It is the latest fast food chain to introduce a halal-only menu after Domino&rsquo;s launched one at a Birmingham store in February.</p>
<p>From this week, KFC bargain buckets, crispy strips and family feasts bought in certain outlets serving high Muslim populations will all have the halal-approved stamp.</p>
<p>The fast-food chain has so far converted eight of its London restaurants to sell the meat, in areas including Forest Gate, West Ham, Tottenham and Bethnal Green.</p>
<p>The chosen branches, which also include those in Beckton, Leyton, Edmonton and Hounslow, will have a logo on the door telling visitors that all food served has been fully approved by the Halal Food Authority (HFA).</p>
<p>As Muslims cannot eat pork, the Halal branches have removed the Big Daddy burger from the menu as it contains bacon.</p>
<p>KFC&rsquo;s scheme will be trialled over the summer, but if it proves a success dozens more branches across the country are expected to follow suit and become halal-only.</p>
<p>The company said halal menus could be launched in other stores where large numbers of Muslim customers are based and &#8216;where there is demand&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Over the next few months it will closely monitor customer feedback in the chosen outlets and if it is good they will be permanently converted to 100 per cent halal.</p>
<p>The move follows a similar decision made by Dominos Pizza, which launched a halal only menu at its Hall Green store in Birmingham earlier this year amid a storm of controversy.</p>
<p>Domino&rsquo;s said the change has improved business despite an initial backlash from non-halal customers who complained they were not able to order pizzas such as the Meteor which contains pepperoni, sausage, meatballs and bacon.</p>
<p>But KFC insists that the taste of its chicken will remain &#8216;finger-lickin good&rsquo; and that it has only converted branches where there are other non-halal ones within a two-mile radius.</p>
<p>KFC vice-president of marketing Jennelle Tilling said: &#8216;We want to see how customers respond to the trial, to see if this is something that allows us to make our great tasting food available to a broader range of customers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A spokesman for KFC said the food would still taste the same as it ever had and that the fast food giant will use existing suppliers to provide the stores with halal meat.</p>
<p>&#8216;This is taking place in areas where there is a high demand for halal and where they is another KFC outlet within two miles for those who do not want it,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is just a chance for us to see if it is something our customers really want or not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Halal means any item on the menu which may contain bacon, ham or pork must be removed and all the chicken must by halal-approved.</p>
<p>Under the rules, the animal should be killed by having its throat cut by a Muslim and any flowing blood of the carcass should be completely drained.</p>
<p>Animals cannot be eaten if they have died of natural causes and have to have been killed.</p>
<p>The chain has also moved to assure customers that its halal certified chicken would meet the rigorous animal welfare standards used across the UK.</p>
<p>Masood Khawaja, President of the Halal Food Authority, welcomed the trial and said it was good news for the Muslim community.</p>
<p>&#8216;Having worked with KFC closely, Halal Food Authority is delighted to accredit the usage of the HFA logo and symbol of approval on endorsed products,&rsquo; Mr Khawaja said.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Muslim community can now enjoy all the products in this trial in eight participating halal-approved restaurants, as these have been procured with full adherence to both Islamic dietary rules and relevant EU hygiene, food safety and animal welfare regulations.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>The ethnic European people of the formerly Great British Nation need to simply get off of that Island, because it no longer belongs to them.  The Muslims and Nigerians, and Pakistani and all the other fast-breeding Third-World peoples need that space.  The Europeans should depart quickly.  However, please leave all your houses and cars and building, and bank accounts, because the poor immigrants will need those.  </p>

<p>Before I read this post, I was thinking along those same lines. England has such a rich history. A relatively small island with with endless accomplishments. And my English cousins, you are giving it all away. You will be a foreigner in what was your land for centuries. What a legacy your children and grandchildren will have to bear. I&rsquo;m heart-sick for you England.</p>

		<p>The US never should have sacrificed young men to protect this place.  That seems to have set a course of events where the current generation thinks someone is going to protect them regardless of what idiotic things they do like letting in 20 million muslims to live on welfare.  Americans can really no longer get visas here yet they give extra points multipliers to muslims becasue of &#8220;hardship&#8221;.  We were fools.</p>

		<p>I see that there&rsquo;s a problem here&hellip; If a non-Muslim walks into one of theses restaurants, it would be a pretty sad sight for them. Paris has lost much of its prestige due to the Muslim slums in the North of the city, let&rsquo;s hope London doesn&rsquo;t go the same way. Try to teach these people that if we tolerate them, they must also tolerate us. Its a fair trade if you ask me.</p>

		<p>The irony in all of this is that KFC will cease to exist once the majority of the Western world turns muslim. </p>
<p>A large part of the problem is that corporations and democratically elected goverments have a short term perspective due to their very nature. If you perform well during this financial year or during this term of office you will have a job during the next financial year or the next term of office. </p>
<p>What happens ten or twenty years down the line unfortunately matters very, very little.</p>

<p>Among other things, a scam to force KFC to hire only Muslims to process their nasty chickens.  Time for a boycott.</p>

		<p>Why should Kentucky Fried Chicken change its menus and eliminate pork, simply because Islam forbids the eating of pork? So what? If Muslims don&rsquo;t like eating pork, then they should stick to eating biscuits dipped in gravy.</p>
<p>Somehow, I don&rsquo;t think Colonel Harlan Sanders ever anticipated Kentucky Fried Chicken going international, and having to change its menu on a nation by nation basis. </p>

My son, an American, whose is white and 26 years old is currently residing in England. He says that where he lives it is still relatively white. He lives in a smaller more rural area. But he also said if you go into any of the medium to larger towns and cities is absolutely overrun with Indians, Middle-Easterners, Muslims, etc.; He says he thinks Scotland is still relatively white. He jokingly says they take William Wallace ( Braveheart ) very seriously.

I have to wonder if anyone in England stops to ask  that question.  Do they even dare think it?  From what I read, even here on Amren, most of  the British STILL don&rsquo;t catch on. To them, Churchill is still a hero beyond reproach. They are lost in a daze of fuzzy propaganda.</p>
