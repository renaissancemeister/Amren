<h1>Placer Park Gift Comes With Troubling Catch: The Name of Shockley</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Magagnini, Sacramento Bee, May 18, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A rare gift of 28 acres of wild forest just north of the city limits has sparked charges of racism and has pitted environmentalists against social activists.</p>
<p>The land known as Shockley Woods was bequeathed to the Auburn Recreation District with $50,000 for upkeep and one condition: It must be named for a man who believed African Americans are inferior and should be paid not to reproduce.</p>
<p>Before most of the district&rsquo;s board realized Shockley  &mdash;  winner of the Nobel Prize in 1956 for co-inventing the transistor  &mdash;  had another, more troubling side, the board voted 3-2 to accept the gift from Shockley&rsquo;s estate. They also agreed to the name: &#8220;Nobel Laureate William B. Shockley And His Wife Emmy L. Shockley Memorial Park.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While 28 acres of open space may be hard to come by, Auburn resident Karen Tajbl said that in 2009, the Shockley name is too high a price to pay, even if it comes with a disclaimer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Public lands should not have strings attached,&#8221; Tajbl said. &#8220;Would the (recreation district) accept 1,000 acres of open space on the condition it be named &#8216;William Joseph Simmons Park?&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>Some might not realize Simmons was one of the leaders of the Ku Klux Klan unless they Googled him, Tajbl said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure don&rsquo;t like naming a park after a racist; no one does,&#8221; Holbrook said. &#8220;But on the other hand, they (the Shockleys) are dead.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What happens if we ignore the request of the estate and call it whatever we want? I don&rsquo;t know if the estate police come after us.&#8221;</p>
<p>William Shockley died in 1989, Emmy Shockley in 2007. Kathleen Golden of the Wells Fargo Wealth Management Group, which administers the Emmy L. Shockley Trust, said the park&rsquo;s 13-word name was Emmy&rsquo;s wish.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like a Hansel and Gretel forest to me,&#8221; said Pamela Vann, the district&rsquo;s landscape architect, as she peered into the dense, dark woods. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a beautiful property and has a lot of potential for passive uses, such as trails and picnic spots.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the recreation district&rsquo;s April 30 board meeting, 30 citizens debated the name. Several environmentalists backed the gift, name and all, because it protects the land from development.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another who backed the gift, Larry W. Smith, organizes Auburn&rsquo;s Martin Luther King Jr. birthday celebration. He said he heard Shockley give a eugenics speech in Palo Alto in the early 1970s.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Gus Thomson, Auburn Journal, April 3, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<blockquote>
<i>[Editor&rsquo;s Note: This seems to be one of the stories that &#8220;broke&#8221; the news that William Shockley was just too despicable a person for a park to be named after him. The article by Michelle Miller-Carl mentioning Shockley&rsquo;s &#8220;racism&#8221; does not appear to be on-line.]</i>
</blockquote>
<p>No doubt about it. William Shockley was one of the smartest humans on the planet.</p>
<p>He was the co-winner of a Nobel Prize in 1956 for his groundbreaking work on transistors and Time magazine chose him as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century.</p>
<p>He was also a racist who thought whites were intellectually superior to blacks and, because of his standing in the scientific community, became the go-to genius for white supremacists and Nazis to point toward when looking for some supportive comments from the academic world.</p>
<p>By what seems to be a quirk of circumstance, his estate included 28 acres of undeveloped land in Auburn and after his widow died in 2007, it was offered to the Auburn Recreation District as a passive park site.</p>
<p>The bequest was approved last week by the board, without any discussion on its donor&rsquo;s racism.</p>
<p>This past week, Journal News Editor Michelle Miller-Carl wrote a story about the parks district&rsquo;s acceptance of the forested land off Auburn Ravine Road and did a Wiki search on the Web to find out more about the famous benefactor. Some disturbing facts about Shockley emerged to go with the story of his landmark scientific discovery.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His list of enemies was a long one, including the two scientists who shared the Nobel with him. Shockley&rsquo;s name isn&rsquo;t on the Bell Labs patent for that first transistor because he lightly oversaw the actual work. He did go on to develop a different, more effective transistor that became the foundation for the electronic age.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>EUGENICS PROPONENT</p>
<p>Shockley began to publicly embrace the theory of eugenics in the 1960s and became one of its most prominent proponents. Technically speaking, eugenics is the name of a movement devoted to improving the human species through the control of hereditary factors in mating.</p>
<p>Some of Shockley&rsquo;s proposals were shockingly discriminatory. It was recorded that he didn&rsquo;t dislike blacks and didn&rsquo;t advocate discriminating against them, but advocated stopping compensatory programs for educating African Americans because of what he believed was their genetic inferiority. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shockley died in 1989, despised by even his own family. His children were estranged and read about his death in newspaper obituaries, his biographer said. His wife, Emmy, lived until 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>BEQUEST REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>Well, it comes down to a requirement of the bequest. To receive the 28 acres, the recreation district board had to agree to name the park &#8220;Nobel Laureate William B. Shockley and his wife Emmy Shockley Memorial Park.&#8221;</p>
<p>The board debated the cost of upkeep before voting 3-2 in favor of accepting the gift, plus $50,000 to help maintain the land. But Shockley&rsquo;s casual bigotry and racism were never addressed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Director Gordy Ainsleigh, who favored the bequest, said he was probably the only board member who knew about Shockley&rsquo;s eugenics views. But he decided not to mention them to the others.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Media Life gave Ainsleigh an opportunity to respond to criticism that naming the park after Shockley would be a serious mistake.</p>
<p>AINSLEIGH COMMENTS</p>
<p>Here are his unedited comments. You can judge for yourself:</p>
<p>&#8220;Regarding Dr. Shockley&rsquo;s views on genetics: It is a solid scientific fact that the genetics of all life forms, from bacteria to humans, are formed by the environment in which our ancestors existed and survived.</p>
<p>&#8220;For instance, in Norway, where many of my genes come from, you see a remarkable ability to produce an organized and orderly home, community and society, because people who wouldn&rsquo;t or couldn&rsquo;t function cooperatively simply were weeded out of the gene pool by the severe winters. Italy, on the other hand, has a much kinder climate that didn&rsquo;t weed out those who were less organized and acted spontaneously on emotion. Italy&rsquo;s government doesn&rsquo;t work nearly as well as Norway&rsquo;s does, but Norway didn&rsquo;t produce Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, either.</p>
<p>&#8220;So Shockley&rsquo;s view that blacks from equatorial Africa have different genetic abilities than whites from northern Europe is unquestionably correct. Where I disagree with Shockley is in his narrow definition of intelligence. Is the proof of intelligence a government that functions intelligently, or the presence of geniuses like Michelangelo and Leonardo?&#8221; Ainsleigh wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;DIFFERENT TIMES&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s also important to judge people by the context of their times and society. Shockley died of old age twenty years ago. He grew up and spent his most productive years in a world where blacks were not allowed to fight beside whites in the military, sit at the same table, or use the same toilet. And all the commanding officers were white. Shockley was a product of his society, and perhaps didn&rsquo;t evolve as fast as his society evolved  &mdash;  a very common human trait.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, he is a Nobel Laureate, and I trust the Nobel committee enough to believe he deserved that prize just as much as Linus Pauling, Ernest Hemingway or John Steinbeck. With all Shockley&rsquo;s awkward realities, Auburn is honored to have been the home of the family that produced a Nobel Laureate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colfax has managed okay after being named after one of the most notorious scoundrels in American political history. I&rsquo;m sure we will do fine with a park named after a Nobel Laureate who was ahead of his time in electronics and behind his time in sociology.&#8221;<br>

			<p> When it comes to matters involving race nowadays, no disagreement is permitted, and only one opinion is tolerated. Can you imagine the recreational district turning down this generous bequest just because the late husband of the donor held views that were &#8220;controversial&#8221; in the eyes of the &#8220;right-thinking people&#8221; in society?</p>
<p> Shockley&rsquo;s views on race have never been disproved, have they? Just because they leave a sour taste in the mouths of the multi-cultural crowd of today, that doesn&rsquo;t mean they are necessarily wrong. </p>

			<p>One of the more nauseating articles to appear on Amren in some time and that&rsquo;s saying something! All the tongue-clucking and moralizing about Mr. Shockley&rsquo;s views, not one of them daring to look at what exactly Shockley&rsquo;s evidence was. Truly sickening.</p>
<p>I think I can predict what will happen: the city will accept the gift of the land but will &#8220;make up for it&#8221; by erecting at the entrance a giant statue of MLK (who, incidentally was another &#8220;racist&#8221;). After all, race was supremely important to MLK and he attributed most black problems to historical white deviltry.</p>

<p>No, Donor had a White Side.  That&rsquo;s what they don&rsquo;t like.  And yes, the Probate Police will come after you.  Don&rsquo;t follow the bequest instructions and any Shockley relative can come out of the woodwork, sue, and get the land back.  </p>

			<p>The Moon landings and the internet would not be possible without Shockley&rsquo;s transistor. He also created Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>William Shockley by himself contributed more to humanity than every black and hispanic person combined.</p>

			<p>BUT!!!! what if the folks DO NOT ACCEPT THE NAME? will the property be taken from them? have OTHER arrangements been made for the propertys disposition? SKIP the psychic predicts&hellip;.they will accept the property, leave it alone for a while and then change the name to honor some black criminal.</p>

			<p>&#8220;race was supremely important to MLK and he attributed most black problems to historical white deviltry.&#8221;</p>
<p>King was very good at it. He never opened his mouth unless there was a chance to suggest whites and or western society and capitalism were evil. Whites like Shockley are demonized for what they believe, their political opinions, while non-whites who commit actually crimes become lionized. Malcolm X was a reformed criminal who believed whites were the seed of Satan.  Nelson Mandela, a terrorist bomber, is practically made a living deity on Earth. Politician Michael White, admits he grew up hating whites, and goes on to become long time mayor of Cleveland.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s said Democrats and Republicans are different branches of the same party. It&rsquo;s even said liberals are often more racist in their platform than are the conservatives. Notice how the left and &#8216;right&rsquo; converge with the automatic assumption that &#8216;eugenics&rsquo; means limitations on black people, black inferiority. I don&rsquo;t doubt Shockley was baited or taken out of context, and I don&rsquo;t doubt some of the racists (as opposed to the pro-white crowd) are rushing to &#8216;agree&rsquo; with Shockley, however, Shockley was a scientist, I&rsquo;m sure his Eugenics plan would prevent some whites from breeding too. &#8216;White nationalists&rsquo; shouldn&rsquo;t be so quick to agree with Shockley. In fact, I imagine Shockley would be more Ok with the extinction of the white race in the name of Eugenics than his most vehement critics would be. Well, to be honest, by the looks of things, his worst critics seem to be Ok with that too.  </p>

			<p>Shockley simply told the truth about average differences in IQ among the races, and about the heritability of IQ, and for that he has become a non-person.  As I recall his eugenic proposal was to pay any people of low IQ not to reproduce.  The very fact the the author of the article said it would be black people paid to not reproduce just shows that he too acknowledges that it is blacks who are disproportionately represented among the dim.</p>
<p>For decades we have been paying stupid people to have children.  The result   &mdash;   hopeless school districts, massive crime, and ruined cities.</p>
<p>Shockley was right.<br>

			<p>Shockley&rsquo;s crime was being race neutral, not racist.</p>
<p>Its really very simple:</p>
<p>If all Americans with IQs below 85 were prevented from reproducing, then only a small percentage of whites would be affected, but 50 % of blacks would be impacted, which would constitute &#8220;genocide&#8221; (in PC language).</p>
<p>Shockley never advocated preventing blacks (or anyone) with high cognitive abilities from reproducing.</p>
<p>His crime was to IGNORE race in favor of his real interest, raising the average cognitive abilities of the US population.</p>
<p>Once we all stop drinking the PC Koolaid, such matters will clear themselves up.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Italy&rsquo;s government doesn&rsquo;t work nearly as well as Norway&rsquo;s does, but Norway didn&rsquo;t produce Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, either&#8221;</p>
<p>The Renaissance Italians were nearly all fair Lombards in Northern Italy. They originated in Denmark. Creatively happens when cold-climate people move to warm climates (Ancient Greece, California). Their energies get diverted from survival into other things.</p>

			<p>Dr. Shockley, as someone on this site already noted, contributed more the human race than all the black Africans in history combined.  And for proving to any sentient person&rsquo;s satisfaction that there are clearly intellectual differences between the races<br>
has all but rendered him a non-person, perhaps a man whose genius was clouded by clear insanity.</p>
<p>Such is the power and enforcement apparatus of the thought police.</p>

			<p>I once worked in the microelectronics industry, and of course William Shockley&rsquo;s views on Africans are well known in those circles.  Unfortunately for the author of this article, Shockley did NOT believe Africans were &#8220;inferior&#8221;; he believed they were actually a different species.</p>
<p>Sadly, whatever name is given this park, it will soon become littered with dirty needles, empty malt-liquor bottles, and used diapers, and infested with junkies, pushers and gang-members. </p>
<p>My own personal hero remains Vlad the Impaler, but Shockley is one of the greats.</p>

<p>I grew up in that area.  It was once a really nice place.  You are right, but more than you think; Any sign will be vandalized and the &#8220;Hansel and Gretal forest&#8221; will be quickly turned into a dump and eventually set on fire.</p>
<p>The Shockleys would have done better if they could have come up with a non-profit group like Sons of Norway to donate the land for private use.  At least the Norwegians would have kept it neat and beautiful.</p>

<p>Sir, you&rsquo;re correct about people having to have the correct views of race today. however, I&rsquo;ve discovered a way to needle our adversaries no end.</p>
<p>If you happen to be on a board and the subject of race comes up, be the biggest supporter of blacks that can be found. Tell everybody how much you love diversity, integration, intermarriage, etc. Also accuse anyone who disagrees with you of horrible racism and White Supremecy, bigotry, etc. Then go on to attribute everything in the world that ever happened or was ever invented or every record ever set as being a black thing. Even go so far as to say things like Galileo was black. Maybe someone like Karl Marx. Kubla Khan, etc. Let yourself go with the supperlatives about blacks. Really go over the top. It really is great fun.</p>

<p>I get the feeling 50% of blacks could outbreed whites even if all whites were encouraged to breed. Also, we shouldn&rsquo;t overlook that fact that &#8216;eugenics&rsquo; could be achieved, not by preventing a single person from having children, but by having the exceptional breed a greater number of children. But of course mother nature would be upset if directed as to how many children to produce.  </p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln did not own slaves but he was a white supremist. His face is on the five dollar bill, and many other places.</p>

devoted to the White Race. As David Duke tells it,<br>
once when they were talking about a blonde actress<br>
who was marrying a Black, the usually undemonstrative<br>
Shockly became very emotional. He said that it was<br>
an utter tragedy and that he would give up all his<br>
awards if he could somehow prevent it.</p>

What a superb idea!
<p>In fact one should never ever donate anything to &#8216;our&rsquo; anti-white governments, but only to pro-white organizations. </p>
