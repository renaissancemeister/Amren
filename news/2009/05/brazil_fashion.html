			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, May 22, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Latin America&rsquo;s top fashion event, the Sao Paulo Fashion Week (SPFW) to be held in Brazil next month, has agreed to boost the number of black models on its catwalks after being targeted by anti-racism campaigners.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, signed Thursday with prosecutors in the state of Sao Paulo, the number of black and indigenous models have to meet a set quota, otherwise fines could be levied against labels taking part.</p>
<p>&#8220;The management of the SPFW is going to indicate to all the labels that at least 10 percent of the casting has to be composed of black, African-descendant or indigenous models,&#8221; it said on its website.</p>
<p>The move came after the prosecutors threatened legal action against the SPFW&rsquo;s organizers unless they increase the number of black models.</p>
<p>In the last SPFW, in January, just eight of the 344 models were black.</p>
<p>An anti-racism group, Educafro, last week warned it would hold a rogue black fashion event in front of the SPFW if the number of black models was not increased.</p>
<p>Advocates of the quota system say the fashion event should be more representative of Brazil&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>According to official figures, just seven percent of Brazil&rsquo;s famously varied population consider themselves purely black  &mdash;  but another 43 percent see themselves as mixed-race of African descent. The other 50 percent call themselves white.<br>

			<p>It is no accident the most attractive &amp; famous models that come out of Brazil are either White or else show strong Europid racial features.</p>

<p>Even the famous mixed-race Brazilian model Adriana Lima, who is a darling of the &#8220;multiculturalist&#8221; crowd, shows a preponderance of White ancestry, something they conveniently overlook.</p>
<p><a href="/adriana_lima/adriana_lima_pictures/adriana_lima_001.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.famous-people-search.com/adriana_lima/adriana_lima_pictures/adriana_lima_001.jpg</a></p>
<p>Brazil is legendary for its color-based caste system, with the lighter elements of society at the top of the food chain, and the darker ones at the bottom.  In that sense, you can call them &#8220;normal&#8221; since that has been the way most human societies have been structured throughout history.</p>
<p>http://www.reference.com/browse/Colorism?jss=1</p>
<p><br>
Thus, the only way Brazilians (or Americans, or Europeans, etc.) could conceivably consent to allowing any black models on their catwalks is if they were forced to do so, since few people outside of other blacks would consider these women &#8220;beautiful.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve read that 75% of Brazilians have 10% or more of African ancestry.  I saw lots of &#8220;tan&#8221; colored people in Sao Paulo who considered themselves white who would not be considered white in the US.</p>

<p>Anti-racism?<br>
They&rsquo;re the ones looking at everyones race really closely. <br>
So today race isn&rsquo;t a social construct?</p>
<p>Well at least those winners of Tyra Banks show &#8216;America&rsquo;s next top Supermodel&rsquo; can finally get some work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m betting 10 to 1 there&rsquo;s a way around that law.  And, I&rsquo;m also betting that if attendance is so small as to be negligible the elitist bigwigs will rescind their perverted order. <br>

			<p>If Brazil is anything like the USA after the 1950&rsquo;s, the &#8216;anti-racist&rsquo; are actually the racists, while the &#8216;racists&rsquo; are, for the most part, objecting to racism and are in fact the anti-racists. The racists win because they control almost all information.  </p>

			<p>They should stop playing games by forcing an inclusion of white featured dark skinned models . It should be required thata quota of pure deep dark African women will strut the runway .<br>
That would cause a reaction from even the dumbest multi-cult worshipper .</p>

			<p>They should pull the fashion show completely out of Sao Paulo and take it elsewhere. Leave them with nothing.  That would show the racial pressure groups that strong-arm tactics and blackmail do not pay.</p>

			<p>White women are more attractive than black women.  The fashion industry knows this and especially black men know this - though they won&rsquo;t admit it, they show it through their actions: their constant pursuit of white females.</p>
<p>I once had the beginnings of a conversation, regarding the above fact, with a female relative of mine who was married to a very intelligent black man (they were both older).  In this case, my relative (the white woman) was extremely upset by the very concept that her race could have given her an advantage over black women in attracting her husband.  Her reaction was so visceral that it was obvious I had struck a nerve.  It was obvious that the truth hurts and she couldn&rsquo;t handle it.  Her black husband, on the other hand, was far more receptive and rational about the whole thing.  He and I would have enjoyed a very stimulating conversation had she not demanded that we both shut up. I&rsquo;m fully convinced that leftists, like my relative above, have no idea how emotional they get when it comes to such issues.  In their minds, they&rsquo;re being perfectly reasonable.  To an impartial observer, however, it is clear that such talk strikes at the heart of their dogma.  It&rsquo;s heresy and cannot be countenanced.  This is one way we know that leftism is a religion; if certain topics are off-limits for discussion simply by virtue of their being &#8220;offensive&#8221;, then this means their positions cannot withstand the light of day.  They collapse under scrutiny.  I say rub it in their faces.  Loudly proclaim &#8220;WHITE WOMEN ARE MORE BEAUTIFUL&#8221;. </p>

  Exactly. The same is also true of our neighbor to the south, Mexico. This being the case, models like Tyra Banks and Naomi Campbell who are glorified in the Anglophone world would never stand a chance in a counrties such as Brazil. And even with quotas in place, the most prominent models will still be mostly white-looking, unless of course they&rsquo;re forced to change that as well.</p>

You are so right about that.  I have seen that sort of thing before. Doubtless most of us have. Their reaction in such a case  is an intensely emotional one.  &#8220;Visceral&#8221; is precisely the word for it.  It has nothing to do with rationality.  You&rsquo;ve said something that strikes at the heart of their belief system and threatens those precious beliefs.  As you say, it&rsquo;s heresy and cannot be countenanced.   If anything, the truth of what you&rsquo;ve said can be measured by the emotionalism of their response. </p>
