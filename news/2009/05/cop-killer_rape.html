			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jaxon Van Derbeken, San Francisco Chronicle, May 5, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The man who gunned down four Oakland police officers had robbed and raped two women at gunpoint earlier the same day as they set up a food cart in East Oakland, police said Monday.</p>
<p>Authorities are not sure whether Lovelle Mixon, 26, shot the two motorcycle officers who pulled him over on a March 21 traffic stop because he feared police would link him to the rapes. Mixon fled after the initial shootings to his sister&rsquo;s nearby apartment, where he killed two more officers with a high-powered rifle before being shot to death.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said earlier that Mixon was tied through DNA to the Feb. 5 rape of a 12-year-old girl in the East Oakland neighborhood where Mixon lived and where the officers were shot to death. The department was notified of the genetic match in that case the day before the killings.</p>
<p>On Monday, investigators said a state laboratory had confirmed that Mixon&rsquo;s DNA matched that of the man who raped two women the morning of March 21.</p>
<p>The victims were attacked at 5:40 a.m. as they set up a cart from which they sold food to day laborers at High Street and International Boulevard, police said.</p>
<p>Thomason said Mixon approached the women, ages 21 and 23, and pulled a handgun  &mdash;  possibly the semiautomatic pistol used to kill the two motorcycle officers seven hours later, police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mixon was on parole at the time of his death, having served time in prison after being convicted in 2002 of assault with a deadly weapon during a robbery in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Since shooting the police officers, Mixon has been linked to a Feb. 21 home-invasion robbery in Modesto in which a gun, cash and gems were stolen. Mixon and another man ransacked the house, pistol-whipped a man and assaulted a woman, authorities say.</p>
<p>Mixon is still being investigated in as many as five other rapes committed in his East Oakland neighborhood in the months before the officers were shot. All the victims of those rapes were attacked in the early-morning hours.</p>
<p>Investigators have suggested that if Mixon committed the string of sex crimes, it may explain why he opened fire on motorcycle officers Sgt. Mark Dunakin, 40, and Officer John Hege, 41, after they pulled him over at MacArthur Boulevard and 74th Avenue.</p>
<p><b>Irregularities with license</b></p>
<p>The officers were about to arrest Mixon during the stop after they discovered irregularities with his driver&rsquo;s license.</p>

			<p>There is a black weekly newspaper in San Francisco called Bayview that I sometimes  come across that  considered this Megathug a hero, and a revolutionary. I wonder what what they will say about him now? Ill bet that they will deny that he did any killings or rapes, and still uphold him because of what his race is. </p>

			<p>Those food carts are Hispanic  &mdash;  I know the mixed neighborhood.</p>
<p>The fact that Mixon raped two Hispanic ladies shortly before he killed the four policemen, and that he was celebrated by some blacks for killing those policemen, isn&rsquo;t going to reduce the strong antipathy most Hispanics feel toward blacks.</p>

			<p> It&rsquo;s obvious that Lovelle Mixon was nothing but a waste of oxygen. Those blacks who rallied in his support, if they can be identified from video tapes, should be rounded up and forced to listen to members of the families of the four dead policemen describe what these people&rsquo;s &#8220;hero&#8221; did to their lives.</p>

			<p>Another black history moment.How can a rapist be a hero?How can a cop killer be a hero?How can the black community excuse this man&rsquo;s behavior just on the basis of the color of his skin.Because he is black no matter what he does they find justification for him.</p>

<p>Actually, black women are the number one victims of the aggression of white men, who are constantly assaulting and insulting them, their mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, sons, and daughters.  That may clear up your confusion.</p>

Typical black dysfunctional justification. This kind of twisted logic is one reason black communities are doomed. They refuse to see their criminals as criminals.</p>
<p>We had an incident in western NY last week where a black teen in a suburban school attacked, without provocation, a white, fellow wrestler teammate and beat him so badly, the white kid needed facial reconstruction.</p>
<p>It turned out the black kid was found guilty a few years back of having set an arson in Buffalo in which a white firefighter was injured and lost a leg. The black kid was granted probation.</p>
<p>Today, our local black radio talk show host claimed this black kid was being railroaded for the assault on the white kid.</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s unbelievable except that when it comes to blacks this is normal logic and is perfectly believable. Blacks claim they want safe neighborhoods but they accept criminality as normal.</p>

			<p>He raped <i>two</i> woman at 5:40 a.m the same day as his &#8216;death by cop&rsquo; suicide.<br>
So the police who were simply pulling him over for a traffic infringement, had no idea what they were walking into or what they were setting off (The Tell-Tale Heart).<br>
Officially/politically as a police officer you can not profile people based on their demographic grouping.<br>
But in terms of risk assessment surely you&rsquo;d have too, even if it&rsquo;s just &#8216;convertly&rsquo; in the interest of self survival.<br>
But then you have to keep this knowledge to yourself because of the threat of being fired. </p>
<p>It may be un-PC to undo the latch on your holster when approaching certain groups, but when crime statistics tell you that when approaching curly haired people for instances, you&rsquo;ll have at least double the chance of them reacting violently, what do you do?<br>
Treat everyone as being <i>equally</i> dangerous?<br>
I must be the most stressful job, I couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p> A few years ago I would have laughed at the conspiracy theorists who would say what I&rsquo;m about to say but now I am fully convinced that they are right.  These mutants are released back onto our streets because those in power want us to be afraid. The more afraid we are the more power we give them. This society has been reduced to what one might see in a futuristic nightmare fantasy except that this nightmare is real.<br>
1. For the past forty or so years the dominant culture i.e. the European- American culture, has been held up to scorn and ridicule.<br>
2. Immigration policy was changed to permit the entrance of millions of immigrants from places whose cultures bear no resemblance to that of the host country and in fact these new arrivals have been subtly encouraged to rebuild microcosms of the places that they left. These include large numbers of Muslims who want to take control of the society and impose their beliefs on the rest of the population.  They seem to have come out of the woodwork since 9/11/01.<br>
3. Our educational system has indoctinated our Euro- American children into believing that they are the products of the most evil culture that has ever existed and our founders and forefathers have been demonized as racist traffickers in human misery. Bars have been lowered in the foolish belief that minorities &#8220;of color could meet the lower standards. Instead, achievement across the board is lower for everyone.<br>
5. The Black population has been indoctrinated in the premise that they are incapable of ever achieving anything because of the existence of the pervasive &#8220;Institutional racism&#8221; and therefore are never to be held accountable for their failings and their sociopathic behavior.  That began when they were released upon the defeated Confederacy to commit depradations on civilians during Reconstruction. Now it&rsquo;s common in all our cities and towns.<br>
6. Killings of large numbers of people by firearm wielding psychotics have become commonplace as have abductions and murders of children.<br>
7. The arrest of a teacher for engaging in sexual activity with students, once a shocking rarity, is now almost routine.<br>
8. The government is gaining more ground in its attempts to abolish incrementally the 2nd Ammendment thereby rendering the law abiding population incapable of defending ourselves against those whom it has unleashed on us. <br>
9. The government is ever more bold in its attempts to abolish the 1st Ammendment thereby forbidding us to speak out in defense of the values upon which this society was built. Any such public expression can result in extremely unpleasant consequences.</p>
<p>Anyone who can&rsquo;t see a pattern here is as naive as the Jewish population of Germany who held on to the faith that sanity would win out.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t get why black women vote 95% Democrat? Let me give you a hint.Black women are 6% of the population and they get over 40% of the welfare, section 8 housing, food stamps, medicade, and up to $5,000 a year tax free called the &#8220;earned income credit.&#8221; </p>

			<p>The &#8220;black community&#8221; did us all a favor by showing everyone their true colors when they paraded around in favor of child rapist cop killer Lovelle Mixon.  The &#8220;civil rights&#8221; community did us another favor by doing nothing to protest the pro-Mixon celebrations.  Where was Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton?  Pretending not to notice.  Every time a black community leader cries racism this bloody shirt should be waved in their face.    </p>

<p>Amazing that you ask this QD. PC indoctrination goes pretty deep, it seems, even with people who read AR. Black women defend black men because Fate and Nature tied their destinies together by making them as one flesh. There is absolutely nothing remarkable in that. </p>
<p>What is remarkable is that white women are willing to turn on white men for all kinds of petty reasons. Turning on them not just personally but also politically by consciously voting against white male rule. It is a big mystery to me that does not compute. How can a women turn against her own flesh, her own mate, her own children, her own father and brothers? </p>
<p>Your race is your fate. That is a law of nature, whether you acknowledge it or not. Of course black women defend their sons, brothers, fathers, mates. They are protecting the future of their kind. Can&rsquo;t you see that? </p>

<p>But that would mean an appeal to their humanity.  And the fact that they would even refer to him as a &#8220;hero&#8221; means ipso facto that they have no humanity to appeal to.<br>
If Mixon is a waste of oxygen, which he clearly was, then so too are those who consider him a &#8220;hero.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amusing to hear a version of the PC viewpoint expressed in the most extreme anti-establishment literature. Clearly at one point the author believed the lies. And his thinking is now grounded in them, even as he&rsquo;s objecting to this or that specific lie. In truth, all of us have been exposed to them. There&rsquo;s no escaping it. Its all we ever hear. It&rsquo;s for another generation to weed out the insanity. All we can do is support each other and at least keep the idea of resistance alive. </p>

<p>Wrong. Blacks as a group benefit from black acts of terror against whites, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t go far enough to provoke a white reaction. Black killers and rapists are acting in black ethnic genetic interests. Those black mamas raised their violent sons just fine from their racial point of view and that&rsquo;s why they don&rsquo;t condemn the behavior. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to be able to acknowledge them, to understand their point of view. It&rsquo;s another thing to defend the insidious racism that has become their lives. It&rsquo;s the year 2009 not 1870.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s a joke, right?</p>
<p>You wrote that ridiculous assertion without providing any proof.</p>
<p>Once Again AmRen is doing the job the msm refuse to do.  Here are a few facts about black and black-on-White crime:</p>
<p>According to FBI and Justice Statistics:</p>
<p>* Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against other blacks. Forty-five percent of the victims of violent crime by blacks are white, 43 percent are black, 10 percent are Hispanic.  </p>
<p>* Blacks are seven times as likely as people of other races to commit murder, eight times more likely to commit robbery and three times more likely to use a gun in a crime.</p>
<p>* Blacks are an estimated 39 times more likely to commit violent crime against a white person than vice versa, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery.</p>
<p>* Between 2001 and 2003, blacks committed, on average, 15,400 black-on-white rapes per year, while whites averaged only 900 white-on-black rapes per year.</p>
<p>* Of the nearly 770,000 violent interracial crimes committed every year involving blacks and whites, blacks commit 85 percent and whites commit 15 percent.</p>
<p>*Blacks are 2.25 times more likely to commit officially-designated hate crimes <br>
against whites than vice versa. </p>
<p>For their percentage of the population (estimated at 12-13%) blacks commit a disproportionate amount of crime.</p>

<p>Posted by Anonymous at 12:17 AM on May 6 </p>
<p>While I agree with most of the comments posted, this one above is a standout. With all the crime disproportionatly  being committed by Obamaniacs (e.g. the Mixon supporters), who do we have trying to take away our freedoms/means of protection? Obama, Eric Holder and former Black Panther Bobby Rush! These guys are basically on the side of the predators.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s one thing to be able to acknowledge them, to understand their point of view. It&rsquo;s another thing to defend the insidious racism that has become their lives. It&rsquo;s the year 2009 not 1870.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anonymous 1:37pm, I couldn&rsquo;t disagree more. Blacks are who they are and I have no problem with that, because their fate is not tied to mine except by my fellow whites who insist on banging their heads against walls trying to &#8220;teach&#8221; cats to be dogs. </p>
<p>What are you trying to say? That blacks should &#8220;get over&#8221; their racism and embrace whites? &#8220;Can&rsquo;t we all just get along?&#8221; You want to &#8220;reform&#8221; blacks? You don&rsquo;t like their &#8220;insidious racism&#8221;? What do yo hope to achieve with that? </p>
<p>These efforts to improve blacks, take the edge off blacks, educate blacks, where has this brought us? It is at best a waste of our time, because whites should be developing their own potential instead of wasting effort meddling in the destiny of another race. At worst this kind of &#8220;hope&#8221; for &#8220;change&#8221; is, well, look around at what this country has become and see for yourself. </p>

			<p>&#8220;What are you trying to say? That blacks should &ldquo;get over&rdquo; their racism and embrace whites? &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we all just get along?&rdquo; You want to &ldquo;reform&rdquo; blacks? You don&rsquo;t like their &ldquo;insidious racism&rdquo;? What do yo hope to achieve with that?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was just saying, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with black folks speaking up for themselves, but I don&rsquo;t necessarily endorse it like the previous poster I was responding to, seems to. I don&rsquo;t have a problem with it in itself. I suppose I do have a problem with everyone and their brother, and the intellectual leaders of our country, taking their rantings, and nothing in this life other than their rantings, seriously. I would even be tempted to say, it&rsquo;s a kind of patronizing&hellip; treating black folks as children or inferior - and some argue this is the source of their problems in the first place. I&rsquo;m not going to say that, and I never do, because, saying that is once again enforcing a black centered reality. Where only what happens to blacks is important.  </p>
<p>I do agree with you when you write, &#8220;whites should be developing their own potential instead of wasting effort meddling in the destiny of another race. At worst this kind of &ldquo;hope&rdquo; for &ldquo;change&rdquo; is, well, look around at what this country has become and see for yourself.&#8221; </p>
<p>I could not have said it better myself. I do wonder about the wisdom of challenging &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo; because I do believe hope and change, that is Obama, is going to fix this economy. I certainly hope so. </p>

			<p>What most White&rsquo;s fail to realize is that black&rsquo;s will almost always rally around another black, no matter how heinous a crime or act committed. This is evident by the fact that almost all black victim&rsquo;s of crime are victimized by other black&rsquo;s. On this the silence is deafening. So when a non black is a victim of black crime the support is almost 100%. This is true of almost the whole spectrum of the black community,including the upper classes and income. White&rsquo;s could use an injection of solidarity.</p>

			<p>Despite a booming population and sky-high housing prices, there are areas here in San Fran that no sane non-black person would consider living anywhere near - no matter how cheap it was.</p>
<p>And I think this could go a long way as to explaining something.</p>
<p>Clearly it is the violence of these areas that is keeping non-blacks out of these neighborhoods, while others are being slowly gentrified (not that gentrification is bad, mind you).</p>
<p>So one could make the argument logically that violence is not tearing black communities apart, but is, in fact, THE ONLY THING HOLDING THEM TOGETHER.</p>
<p>Perhaps some blacks realize this&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure a lot of so-called &#8220;black community leaders&#8221; recognize this, which is why they are so reluctant to do anything about black-on-black violence, despite all of the utterly meaningless &#8220;stop the violence&#8221; talk.</p>

Excellent point, David K.  That&rsquo;s never occurred to me before, but I think you&rsquo;re on to something.  </p>
<p>One of the few qualities in which blacks successfully out-compete other races is random violence and senseless brutality.  It should be no surprise that their leaders use this to their advantage against other racial groups.  </p>

			<p>&#8220;A few years ago I would have laughed at the conspiracy theorists who would say what I&rsquo;m about to say but now I am fully convinced that they are right. These mutants are released back onto our streets because those in power want us to be afraid. The more afraid we are the more power we give them. This society has been reduced to what one might see in a futuristic nightmare fantasy except that this nightmare is real.&#8221;</p>
<p>I absolutely agree.  It began in the 1920&rsquo;s when the liberals began defending black rapists of White women.  They were so successful that the myth of false accusation still lingers.  For years, the Alameda County (Oakland) Distritc&rsquo;t attorney&rsquo;s office refused to prosecute any black on White rape, no matter how horrible because any such prosecution would just provide an excuse for White librals and black community activists to riot.<br>

			<p>Actually, black women are the number one victims of the aggression of white men, who are constantly assaulting and insulting them, their mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, sons, and daughters. That may clear up your confusion.</p>

<p>The jealousy of this fraud is amazing. It isn&rsquo;t whites who are supremely, impulsively violent in numbers that dwarf those of any other race. Although I have my doubts as to &#8220;black insurgent&#8221; actually being black, it is funny sometimes to see blacks pop off like this. Only because they don&rsquo;t realize that most of them owe their entire existence to whites. Because whites foot the bill for their unmarried mothers to raise them, for the schools to act as day-care centers, for the jails to house and feed them after they arrested. It goes on and on and on. </p>
