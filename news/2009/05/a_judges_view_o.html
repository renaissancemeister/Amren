<h1>Identity Politics and Sotomayor</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stuart Taylor, National Journal, May 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion [as a judge] than a white male who hasn&rsquo;t lived that life.&#8221;  &mdash;  Judge Sonia Sotomayor, in her Judge Mario G. Olmos Law and Cultural Diversity Lecture at the University of California (Berkeley) School of Law in 2001</p>
<p>The above assertion and the rest of a remarkable speech to a Hispanic group by Sotomayor  &mdash;  widely touted as a possible Obama nominee to the Supreme Court  &mdash;  has drawn very little attention in the mainstream media since it was quoted deep inside The New York Times on May 15.</p>
<p>It deserves more scrutiny, because apart from Sotomayor&rsquo;s Supreme Court prospects, her thinking is representative of the Democratic Party&rsquo;s powerful identity-politics wing.</p>
<p>Sotomayor also referred to the cardinal duty of judges to be impartial as a mere &#8220;aspiration because it denies the fact that we are by our experiences making different choices than others.&#8221; And she suggested that &#8220;inherent physiological or cultural differences&#8221; may help explain why &#8220;our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging.&#8221;</p>
<p>So accustomed have we become to identity politics that it barely causes a ripple when a highly touted Supreme Court candidate, who sits on the federal Appeals Court in New York, has seriously suggested that Latina women like her make better judges than white males.</p>
<p>Indeed, unless Sotomayor believes that Latina women also make better judges than Latino men, and also better than African-American men and women, her basic proposition seems to be that white males (with some exceptions, she noted) are inferior to all other groups in the qualities that make for a good jurist.</p>
<p>Any prominent white male would be instantly and properly banished from polite society as a racist and a sexist for making an analogous claim of ethnic and gender superiority or inferiority.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I have been hoping that despite our deep divisions, President Obama would coax his party, and the country, to think of Americans more as united by allegiance to democratic ideals and the rule of law and less as competing ethnic and racial groups driven by grievances that are rooted more in our troubled history than in today&rsquo;s reality.</p>
<p>I also hope that Obama will use this Supreme Court appointment to re-inforce the message of his 2004 Democratic convention speech: &#8220;There&rsquo;s not a black America, and white America, and Latino America, and Asian America; there&rsquo;s the United States of America.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in this regard, the president&rsquo;s emphasis on selective &#8220;empathy&#8221; for preferred racial and other groups as &#8220;the criteria by which I&rsquo;ll be selecting my judges&#8221; is not encouraging, as I explained in a May 15 post on National Journal&rsquo;s The Ninth Justice blog.</p>
<p>As for Sotomayor&rsquo;s speech, fragmentary quotations admittedly cannot capture every qualification and nuance. She also stressed that although &#8220;men lawyers .&nsbp;.&nbsp;. need to work on&#8221; their &#8220;attitudes,&#8221; many have already reached &#8220;great moments of enlightenment.&#8221; She noted that she tries to be impartial. And she did not overtly suggest that judges should play identity politics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The full text of the speech, as published in the Berkeley La Raza Law Journal in 2002, is available on The New York Times website. (It says that the speech was in 2002; I&rsquo;ve read elsewhere that it was October 2001.)</p>
<p>To some extent, Sotomayor&rsquo;s point was an unexceptionable description of the fact that no matter how judges try to be impartial, their decisions are shaped in part by their personal backgrounds and values, especially when the law is unclear. As she detailed, for example, some studies suggest that female judges tend to have different voting patterns than males on issues including sex discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Do we want a new justice who comes close to stereotyping white males as (on average) inferior beings?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I do not claim that the very different worldview displayed in Sotomayor&rsquo;s speech infuses her hundreds of judicial opinions and votes rendered over more than a decade on the Appeals Court. But only a few of her cases have involved the kind of politically incendiary issues that make the Supreme Court a storm center.</p>
<p>IIn one of her few explosive cases, Sotomayor voted (without writing an opinion) to join two colleagues in upholding what I see as raw racial discrimination by New Haven, Conn. The city denied promotions to the firefighters who did best on a test of job-related skills because none was black. (See my column, &#8220;New Haven&rsquo;s Injustice Shouldn&rsquo;t Disappear.&#8221;)</p>

								<h2><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104530389">Obama Chooses Sotomayor for Supreme Court</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Deborah Tedford, National Public Radio, May 26, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>President Obama on Tuesday nominated U.S. Circuit Judge Sonia Sotomayor to serve on the Supreme Court, tapping the daughter of Puerto Rican parents to succeed retiring Justice David Souter and become the first Hispanic to serve on the high court.</p>
<p>Calling Sotomayor &#8220;an inspiring woman,&#8221; Obama said that he looked not only at intellect and the ability to be impartial, but at life experience and the ability to relate to ordinary Americans in choosing Sotomayor as his nominee.</p>
<p>At a White House news conference, Sotomayor thanked the president for &#8220;the most humbling honor&#8221; of her life. &#8220;My heart today is bursting with gratitude,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>If confirmed by the Senate, the 54-year-old judge will bring nearly 17 years of experience on the federal bench and a history of bipartisan appeal to the high court. She was first appointed to federal bench in the Southern District of New York in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush and was named to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals by President Bill Clinton in 1998.</p>
<p><b>Hispanic Groups Laud Choice</b></p>
<p>Obama said Sotomayor has more experience as a judge than any of the justices had when they were nominated for their positions on the high court.</p>
<p>Hispanic groups lauded the president&rsquo;s choice. &#8220;The Supreme Court should reflect the diverse population of the United States to ensure that our nation&rsquo;s highest court understands the unique circumstances of all Americans,&#8221; said Brent Wilkes, national executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens.</p>
<p>If confirmed, Sotomayor will join Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the second woman on the current court and the third in history. Sotomayor, like the retiring Souter, is expected to vote with the court liberals.</p>
<p>Republicans are not expected to put up much of a fight against the nomination. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine said Republicans would have a difficult time taking on a judge that was first appointed to the federal bench by Republican.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&rsquo;s been pretty carefully vetted and analyzed already, so I would find it unusual if they were to decide to try to take her on,&#8221; Kane said.</p>
<p>Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said the upcoming court vacancy provides an opportunity to discuss the role the Supreme Court has in the daily lives of Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Republicans look forward to learning more about federal appeals court judge Sonia Sotomayor&rsquo;s thoughts on the importance of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s fidelity to the Constitution and the rule of law,&#8221; Steele was quoted saying on the RNC Web site.</p>
<p><b>Republicans Want Time for Debate</b></p>
<p>Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said his colleagues will treat Sotomayor fairly but want time to debate her qualifications.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will thoroughly examine her record to ensure she understands that the role of a jurist in our democracy is to apply the law even-handedly, despite their own feelings or personal or political preferences,&#8221; McConnell said in a statement posted on his Web site.</p>
<p>Sotomayor predicted senators would come to see her as an ordinary person who has had some extraordinary opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope that as the Senate and American people learn more about me, they will see that I am an ordinary person who has been blessed with extraordinary opportunities and experiences,&#8221; Sotomayor said.</p>
<p>During the East Room announcement, the president cited Sotomayor&rsquo;s educational accomplishments at Princeton University  &mdash;  where she graduated summa cum laude in 1976  &mdash;  and Yale University Law School. He also said her stint trying criminal cases as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan after her graduation from Yale Law School, corporate law experience and time as a trial judge gave her an edge because she has seen the judicial system from many perspectives.</p>
<p>One of her most prominent rulings came in 1995, when she sided with Major League Baseball players in a labor strike that had led to the cancellation of that season&rsquo;s World Series.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over a distinguished career that spans three decades, Judge Sotomayor has worked at almost every level of our judicial system, providing her with a depth of experience and a breadth of perspective that will be invaluable as a Supreme Court justice,&#8221; Obama said.</p>
<p>The president also said he was moved by her inspirational personal story.</p>
<p>Sotomayor was raised in a housing project in New York&rsquo;s South Bronx by Puerto Rican parents who came to the United States during World War II. Her father was a factory worker who had a third-grade education and spoke no English. He died when she was 9, a year after she was diagnosed with Type 1, or juvenile, diabetes.</p>
<p>Sotomayor said she was strongly influenced by her mother, who served in the Women&rsquo;s Army Corps and often worked two jobs to support Sotomayor and her brother, Juan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have often said that I am all I am because of her, and I am only half the woman she is,&#8221; Sotomayor said, recognizing her mother and other family members seated in the audience as the president announced her nomination.</p>
<p><b>An Upward Career Path</b></p>
<p>Obama said the couple believed in the American dream and the power of education. Sotomayor attended Catholic school and went on to attend Princeton and Yale.</p>
<p>From 1984 until her appointment to the bench, Sotomayor practiced international business law at the New York-based firm of Pavia &amp; Harcourt LLP. There, she focused on intellectual property issues and litigation and arbitration of commercial and commodity export trading cases, according to her appeals court biography.</p>
<p>Later, Sotomayor became a member of the 2nd Circuit Task Force on Gender, Racial and Ethnic Fairness in the Courts, which was established in 1993 to examine the effect of bias on court employees and litigants. She has also remained active in legal education, serving as an adjunct professor at New York University School of Law from 1998-2007 and as a lecturer-in-law at Columbia Law School since 1999.</p>
<p>She has also served on the Board of Directors of the State of New York Mortgage Agency, the New York City Campaign Finance Board, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund and the Maternity Center Association.<br/>

			<p>That&rsquo;s right:  a &#8220;Latina&#8221; woman with her &#8220;Latina&#8221; experiences is the best person to hold one of the highest positions in our legal system, which is based on ENGLISH common law.</p>
<p>I wish these &#8220;proud&#8221; Latinos would live in a Latin country.</p>

			<p>I like her rags to riches life story.  Therefore, it is really sad that she has spent a lot of time on the 2nd Appellate Circuit, and will spend more on the Supreme Court, denying such opportunities to non-rich whites.</p>
<p>I get the feeling that almost every promotion she has had until now (and honestly, counting now) has been affirmative action.  If I&rsquo;m reading her narrative right, her first job out of law school was in the New York City District Attorney&rsquo;s office.  I&rsquo;m sure that in a city like New York, that affirmative action is used heavily in hiring fresh out of law school lawyers for the DA&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Did I miss the provision in the Constitution that Supreme Court justices must have graduated from an Ivy League law school?  I think we need more Jesuit law school grads on SCOTUS.</p>
<p>It is more likely that the moon is made of green cheese than the Senate Republicans will put up a filibuster.  With luminaries in its ranks like Lindsay Grahamnesty, John McAmnesty, Samnesty Brownback, John Cornesty and Kay Bailey Amnesty, the Stupid Party sits in the election patch every other early November waiting for the Great Hispanic Vote Pumpkin to arise from the ground.  Of course it never arises, though Linus Van Amnesty never has to worry about missing the party because the other party is the one that wins.  I think many Senate Republicans would rather die or live under Marxist tyranny than offend a Hispanic.</p>

This could be the old &#8216;let&rsquo;s put out an extremist first who we know will be turned down so we can nominate a &#8216;moderate&#8221; </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the Sotomayor video where she talks about how judges are not supposed to set policy (*wink*). The chuckling by the group says it all:</p>

<p>Thank you, AmRen. I have read quite a few articles on her since the announcement by the blessed Adiministration, and was beginning to think, hmm, is this actually a &#8220;minority&#8221; without the usuall baggage? Thank you for the answer, AmRen.</p>

			<p>I am glad to hear Judge Sotomayor is honest about personal bias. While she is the wrong color to judge me or my racial brethren, she at least has opened the door to bringing bias up at her confirmation; and for once it would be a non-white female who is called to account for racism and sexism.</p>

			<p>Give me a blankety-blank-blanking break! When will we, white people, finally have enough of this @*$% ? Why have a Title VII? Why have a Civil Rights Act? When will we finally stand up and call these people out on their racially-motivated decisions? When will we finally say enough is enough? </p>
<p>How many more laughably transparent decisions like this will we tolerate before we tell these minorities to go pound sand? Not only did Obama-rama make a decision based on gender, he made one on race as well! </p>

<p>What the fat latina said didn&rsquo;t get much attention due to our mainstream media being a highly controlled &#8220;entertainment&#8221; &#8220;forum&#8221; run by people who form groups with other people in business and academia and the military etc&hellip;  and decide by exerting insidious influence what will be cencored and what will not.  One world socialist order is the order of the day so whites will be controlled and kept in order while the fat latina and her like will move forward as planned. </p>

			<p>It would seem that if the Republicans had any spine, which they don&rsquo;t, they should be able to derail Sotomayer&rsquo;s nomination by drawing attention to the speech and the New Haven firemen case. But pigs will fly when this happens. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame to see this judge, who rose to her position thanks to the goodwill and civilization of White Men, reveal herself as another of the identity ingrates. </p>

			<p>This brutish-looking woman has a neanderthal appearance and from her many unintelligent remarks it&rsquo;s plain to see that she&rsquo;s no more than a buffoon.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now at the stage where incompetent non-whites can utter almost anything they desire that insults whites with no fear at all of being held accountable for it.</p>
<p>We can thank our spinless, gutless leaders for the situation we&rsquo;re in, and, most especially, Ted Kennedy, the greatest traitor our people has ever known.</p>
<p>This is just more irrefutable proof that the US is continuing to degenerate further toward third world levels and, eventually, large scale civil strife.<br/>

			<p>I&rsquo;m no legal scholar, but this appointment reeks of affirmative action.  Perhaps this will serve to wake a few people up (if they can pull themselves away from the basketball game) to the fact that they are being systematically displaced.</p>

			<p>This is just another domino in the chain that quite clearly shows me one simple thing.</p>
<p>Fellow AmRen posters, I read your posts and don&rsquo;t agree with all of you all the time, but can certainly understand how most of you feel.</p>
<p>We, as a nation, are watching the federal government assume more and more power in (and through identity politics like this OVER) our daily lives.</p>
<p>When you finish reading this post, please do some research on the growing 10th Amendment movement in our country.  More and more people in our country are recognizing that the federal government simply wields too much power over how we live our daily lives.</p>

			<p>Judges should behave as a neutral umpire.  Would you want an umpire to favor the Yankees over the Red Sox during a game?  With Sotomayor&rsquo;s empathy and identity politics favoring certain groups over others, does that mean a black judge favoring other blacks, white judges favoring other whites, or a gay judge favoring other gays?  If that&rsquo;s the case then multiculturalism is a lie and will never work.  You will have every group fighting every other group for power and rights over the other groups.  There will be nothing but constant fighting and bickering within society: tribe against tribe.  This is what happens in third world countries where objectivity and the rule of law is ignored.  Rulings there are based on feelings and prejudices.  As far as &#8220;empathy&#8221; is concerned, does that mean that a judge who feels sorry for a criminal should let him go free.  The ultimate solution, if the above is true, would be to separate and segregate the various racial and ethnic groups.</p>

			<p>Perhaps the coronation of Sotomayor will be the final nail in the coffin of the Stupid Party and will finally motivate more Whites to look for Real Alternatives that actually in fact look out for their White Nationalist Interests.  </p>
<p>I mean if they can&rsquo;t stop Sotomayor, seriously what good is the Stupid Party anymore?!?!?!? </p>

			<p>&#8220;I have been hoping that despite our deep divisions, President Obama would coax his party, and the country, to think of Americans more as united by allegiance to democratic ideals and the rule of law and less as competing ethnic and racial groups driven by grievances that are rooted more in our troubled history than in today&rsquo;s reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, ladies  and gentlemen, is exactly the type of &#8220;conservatives&#8221; we should avoid like the plague. The type who &#8220;believe&#8221; and &#8220;hope&#8221; that &#8220;we shall overcome&#8221; racial and cultural differences. These people want to convince us that we should adopt a so-called colorblind approach and get others to do the same. If we follow their advice we will most assuredly lose our country. </p>
<p>Instead, I suggest, we should follow the advice of white men (not &#8216;males&rsquo;) like Jared Taylor and strengthen our own racial feelings so we can, finally, advance our interests. </p>

			<p>Actually, I completely agree with the statement &#8216;Hispanic women are wiser than White men&rsquo; - after all since the whole edifice of White male supremacy started crumbling in the USA, it was only the lassitude, ineptness and sheer naivety and foolishness of White men themselves that enabled the transformation.<br/>

			<p>I have to applaud Ranger, he took the words right off of my fingertips! From his deft description of her as being brutish looking, to his remarks about Comrade Kennedy&rsquo;s treason, it was all dead on right!</p>
<p>One quick point that I would like to add, is the fact that the magic mulatto, our wondrous and historic &ldquo;savior,&rdquo; General Secretary Obama, has certainly acted with expedient &ldquo;courage&rdquo; here. He pulled this Latino bunny right out of his hat, just as the North Koreans are making it plain they intend to test his much media hyped &ldquo;brains and guts&rdquo; on the world stage. Funny, that just yesterday morning, that was what the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media (including TASS-USA, or as it is more commonly known as, MSNBC) was all nervously abuzz about that, but today it is all about his politically &ldquo;ingenious&rdquo; pick of Comrade Sonia. </p>
<p>Yep, the usual aiding and abetting by the Marxstream media here; along with, Comrade BO&rsquo;s expected filling of his Pampers and an evasive domestic political tactic to cover up his appalling fecklessness internationally. Heck, who would have thought that he would figure out a way to vote &ldquo;present&rdquo; from the Oval Office.</p>

			<p>She most likely feels she is wiser than white women, too!</p>
<p>White men destroyed themselves when they granted white women and all other races voting privileges.  The Founding Fathers didn&rsquo;t allow it and they were far wiser than anyone I&rsquo;ve met in this day and age.  It is now approaching critical mass and the only solution is to return to the homelands of Europe.  This country has been lost and the only one to blame is looking right at you in the nearest mirror.</p>
<p>How many fools on this site do you see stating they voted for Obama to teach the Republicans a lesson?  The only lesson learned was by these voters on just how ignorant - and utterly foolish - their actions were.  Now we&rsquo;re all paying the price.  I&rsquo;m starting to hate white people, too!<br/>

			<p>It is highly doubtful that a modern Hispanic woman&rsquo;s perspective will illuminate hidden truths in legal documents written by hateful White males more than 200 years ago.  What she is telling America, is that she will let her ethnic background influence how she INTERPRETS those writings, and that&rsquo;s something that the current White majority should at least spend a few moments thinking about.  What will it mean when different ethnic groups use their own cultural views to change / replace the underpinnings of your own, particularly when that change is happening at the nation&rsquo;s most fundamental legal level?</p>
<p>As for her obvious bias in favor of her own ethnic group, I have no objection.  I think such a stance is eminently practical, and I wish that modern Whites had a fraction of that devotion to their own people.  People simply don&rsquo;t understand - the era of American ethnic realpolitik is upon us, and the various ethnic groups are going to squabble endlessly over the division of the spoils.  That&rsquo;s what political power is all about in our system of government.  Whites have spent so long dividing themselves over invented differences, e.g. conservative vs. liberal, that they are completely and woefully unprepared to deal with the reality that other ethnic groups will display solidarity along ETHNIC lines instead of philosophical lines.</p>
<p>A rude awakening awaits the soon-to-be-displaced White majority in this country.  </p>

			<p>Say what you will about neo-con Rush Limbaugh, but he was all over this yesterday, sounding like the race realist I&rsquo;m sure he is behind closed doors.</p>
<p>On a smaller scale, in the LA radio market, John and Ken, as racially realist as allowed by the PC FCC, also had a long segment on the wise Latina/clueless White man comment  &mdash;  John was especially furious as he is the son of Polish immigrants, grew up 10 miles from sotomeyor and has a similar background without the AA boost, of course.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting tidbit from Rush on the Ricci case:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Ironically, Sotomayor&rsquo;s dreadful decision in Ricci is under review at this time by the Supreme Court with an opinion expected by the end of June when David Souter, the justice Sotomayor is nominated to replace, has announced his retirement&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>From article II:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said his colleagues will treat Sotomayor fairly but want time to debate her qualifications&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll give her the same &#8216;Borking&rsquo; the democrats gave to Clarence Thomas.</p>

			<p>We white Americans are our own worst enemy and now we are reaping  what we have sown.  I so regularly hear white people, including my wife, who desire to move to some all-white enclave as if it would be pure heaven.  When you find this place it can easily have some things you didn&rsquo;t consider.  </p>
<p>For one, it could be full of liberal, self-hating white Americans who learned what they know from old movies like Mississippi Burning.  To them you will appear to be a barbaric racist for your views and you will be shunned.  </p>
<p>In another you might be surrounded by white people locked in a nasty cronie class war.  In these areas you will find only a small middle class, assorted super-wealthy white masters and a massive number of welfare white Americans fighting below for the crumbs.  It will break your heart to see all those white people proudly lining up for their free food and bragging about the benefits they get for doing nothing.  Naturally your proud white views will be met with apathy by the welfare bunch, the few in the middle class who want to talk about it will probably see your perspective but will have been long ago beaten down by the reality of it.  The wealthy don&rsquo;t care, sharing culture is as foreign to them as sharing money.</p>
<p>Of course you could save your money and try to get into some kind of exclusive gated community.  These are not usually known for being long-term neighborhoods where people know each other for decades.  Often they have a higher home turnover than middle class neighborhoods.  While they may be zoned for better schools, you may find that your children are ostracized for being of a different fabric.  It&rsquo;s one thing to live in such a community, it&rsquo;s another to be able to afford a country club membership.  Still you will encounter apathy over any pro-white issues because most of your neighbors are there specifically to avoid the issue.  </p>
<p>I have to raise my children where I can afford.  My semi-useless hippy parents were too busy chanting for the cause of the week to prepare me for things like School Busing or the huge chip black Americans carry toward the most vulnerable white person they can find.  I wasn&rsquo;t given free college, I had to join the military to save enough.  </p>
<p>I am constantly having to augment my children&rsquo;s education.  Thanks to Southern schools my kids are fed a regular diet of Africa but have no idea how to find Belgium on a map (they can now of course!).  To be honest we have lots of worthless black Americans here and they serve me well as classic examples of the worst humanity can offer.  My kids get to see them act up in class, in theaters, at the grocery store, in ANY public park and often on the news.</p>
<p>So I begin to appreciate some elements of proximity to black Americans so I can use their example to prove the point that they are not to be held in any kind of esteem.  I have the figures and the facts to show my kids that emulating ghetto losers puts white kids only in a position to be laughed at by ghetto losers!</p>
<p>The real message we need to show white American children is that it is far cooler to be a white winner than to idolize a culture that would prefer you died horribly so they could rise (they can&rsquo;t on their own).  We also need to find solidarity as white people, something we haven&rsquo;t had in a very long time.  Every effort to enhance white pride is met with disgusting apathy on the part of white Americans and cries of racism from everyone else.  I want to be part of a white movement that is NOT tied to any proven hate groups so that I can at least express pride without fearing legal issues.  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m alone in this opinion.  </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need another group to gripe about minorities, minorities make their issues known pretty readily.  We need a group to lead white America with the pride our people deserve for bringing about such an incredible nation.</p>

<p>Like the chicken brought up with puppies, it doesn&rsquo;t matter where her name came from - although it is interesting.  I have wondered about it while listenting to the news people try to figure out how to actually pronounce it (suspected that it was an erroneous spelling of a Germanic name).  A Jewish or Nazi agent is unlikely, but a very entertaining set of choices.  No need to challenge history and reason; She was brought up as a Puerto Rican in NYC, so that is what she is and how her politics will work.</p>

There is nothing hidden in her name. It&rsquo;s a rather common Spanish name. It&rsquo;s not in any way German.  And it isn&rsquo;t meyer, it&rsquo;s mayor.   Soto  (as in de Soto) is Spanish for a thicket, grove. And mayor is large or major. Thus, &#8220;large grove&#8221;.   There are a number of Spanish names that do come from German (old Visigothic), such as Guzmán (Gutmann, Goodman),  others from Flemish:  Bécquer  (Becker, Baker),  but this is not one of them.<br/>
Pure coincidence. I&rsquo;ve never heard of any Sotos in German/Dutch. More likely they came FROM Spain, not TO Spain.</p>

It&rsquo;s not a rare trait at all in northwestern Spain (Galicia) where the population is Celtic and closely related to the Irish. Spain contains many ethnic strains; it is not a country with a single uniform population. I knew a young woman of Galician parentage who told me she is mistaken for Irish all the time.

			<p>&#8220;&hellip;You want them to feel pride in their nation, yet multiculturalism defines the nation&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Multiculturalism is forced ONLY on Whites by the Freudo-Marxist government.</p>
<p>Every other racial/ethnic group is encouraged to &#8216;embrace&rsquo; its traditions and &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; culture, its separateness from White culture  &mdash;  and they have their lavishly funded race-/ethnic- based groups and government force to back them up if we Whites don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>If you object to colonization in your neighborhood by hostile, disease-ridden, violent, anti-White third world hoards, these powerful race-based groups will happily sic their high-powered lawyers after you, no holds barred, to destroy your livelihood and reputation and target any wealth you may have for confiscation.</p>
<p>In the schools where I work, we have Cinco De Mayo and black, hispanic and Asian history month replete with celebrations, praise and acknowledgement.  Meanwhile, Whites continue to be debased, mocked, held responsible for all the evils of history. Lately, the gays have jumped on the multi-cult juggernaut (while keeping themselves separate, of course, they don&rsquo;t want to give up their specific group power) and are demanding that they be prominently included in all aspects of the K-12 school curricula.  </p>
<p>The hostile elites who control the government have taken advantage of White tendencies toward individualism and individual rights  &mdash;  and used this to their advantage  to atomize us and keep us separated and powerless.  At this point, we are not even allowed to form White-based groups for our protection and advocacy without being called Nazis by frothing at the mouth leftists.  Whites, of course crumble in fear, often with very good reason (Trent Lott).</p>
<p>As another poster wrote to me:  They understand your psychology better than you do.</p>
<p>Nominees such as the race-based, anti-White sotomeyor are just one more indication of the hostile elites&rsquo; goal of destroying Western Civilization and the Whites who created it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what their endgame is  &mdash;  seems if the hostile elites get their wish, their wealth will be vulnerable to confiscation as well.</p>

			<p>To those who post about pride in America.</p>
<p>America is like a pail; the people are like water in the pail. </p>
<p>Once, the water in the pail was us.  Now it is not.  Why do you still have pride in the pail?</p>
<p>America is no longer a White country.  It is not our country.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism is the genocide of Whites. We need a revival of our people and we need to bring it in intelligently and with a quiet understanding that genes are us, and that race, which is the cumulative effect of genes is not something trivial but is our most essential and genuine identity.</p>

			<p> It was a great country for the 230 years or so that white men ruled the country. Look at the country now after the 1965 Immigration Act. Look at all the malcontents. This was a country built by white males for white people. Anyone else could leave.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t happen suddenly either. The slippery slope began, I&rsquo;d say, in 1898.  We acquired the Philippines and Puerto Rico   &mdash;   two demographic millstones around our neck that benefited only the sugar companies, steamships, and banks.   Then we meddled in the First WW, which was none of our business, but led to more concessions to pacify the minorities and keep peace at home. That made us a world power, giving more profits to the corporations and the banks.  The rich became super-rich.  That in turn led into WW2, and after that, racial integration and still more concessions to &#8220;minorities&#8221; who had by now became sacred cows, above all reproach.   By the mid 60&rsquo;s, the lid was off the kettle and it was boiling over, with concessions coming one after another.   After 1965, America was up for grabs and the word was out:  the white race had gone insane and  was committing suicide;  they were giving away their country. Come everyone, and help yourselves!  Soon thereafer, &#8220;country&#8221;  became the white countries, and they were <b><i>all  </i></b>up for grabs.  Biggest firesale in the history of the world!</p>
<p>Whites everywhere had been turned into lemmings.</p>
