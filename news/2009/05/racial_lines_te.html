<h1><a href="https://www.columbian.com/article/20090509/APP/905090731">Racial Lines Tested in Calif. House Race</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael R. Blood, AP, May 9, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Racial lines are being tested in a Southern California congressional race in which an Asian candidate is a leading contender in a district that has been a Hispanic stronghold for years.</p>
<p>The contest to fill the vacant seat in a heavily Democratic stretch of Los Angeles and its eastern suburbs is a snapshot of the state&rsquo;s fluid racial landscape.</p>
<p>An area where Hispanics supplanted a largely white and Japanese population has in recent years seen a surge in Asian newcomers, including Filipinos, Vietnamese and Chinese.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The neighborhoods of the 32nd Congressional District were once thick with Italian delis and Armenian restaurants. Today, Cedillo [Gil Cedillo, a Hispanic state senator and candidate for the open spot] said, &#8220;one block looks like Saigon, another one will look like Taipei and then the third one will look like .&nsbp;.&nbsp;. Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>Former state Assembly member Judy Chu knows she can&rsquo;t win the May 19 special election without drawing support from Hispanics, who make up about half the registered voters and two-thirds of the population.</p>
<p>The seat  &mdash;  held by Rep. Hilda Solis until she resigned to become President Barack Obama&rsquo;s labor secretary  &mdash;  has been in Hispanic hands since the early 1980s.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I have a great chance to win,&#8221; said Chu, a member of the California Board of Equalization, which oversees the state&rsquo;s various tax programs and hears tax appeals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are 12 candidates on the ballot  &mdash;  eight Democrats, three Republicans and a Libertarian. It&rsquo;s unlikely any candidate will get the required majority to win outright on election night. If no candidate clears that mark, the top finishers in each party will advance to a July 14 runoff.</p>
<p>But the runoff would be a formality. The Democrat will be the all-but-certain winner in a district where the party holds a more than 2-to-1 registration edge over Republicans. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Endorsements have cut across racial and ethnic lines, and assumptions about racial bloc voting and identity politics are being challenged in the era of President Barack Obama, the first black in the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, one of the nation&rsquo;s most recognized Hispanic politicians, endorsed Chu and is raising money for her campaign. Villaraigosa and Cedillo have not been close since their days in the California Legislature.</p>
<p>Solis is staying out of the race, but Chu has endorsements from Solis&rsquo; husband, mother, father and sisters. She also has the backing of the powerful Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, headed by Maria Elena Durazo.</p>
<p>Cedillo has picked off Asian support, including endorsements from a state senator and an Assembly member.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chu&rsquo;s Web site features pictures of her with Villaraigosa and Solis family members. Cedillo clearly wants a strong turnout from Hispanics, but one mailer talks about his work with Filipino-American veterans.</p>
<p>White voters are a sliver of the electorate but could provide a decisive margin in what&rsquo;s expected to be a low-turnout election.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Political scientist Raphael Sonenshein gives Chu a slight edge, given her close political ties to the district, which includes the area she represented in the Assembly. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;To beat her, you really have to pretty much convince Latino voters to vote as Latinos,&#8221; says Sonenshein, who teaches at California State University, Fullerton. &#8220;His advantage is the growing Latino consciousness in the state.&#8221;</p>
<p>The district&rsquo;s population is about 64 percent Hispanic, 20 percent Asian, 12 percent white and 2 percent black.</p>
<p>Chu and Cedillo have strong ties to immigrant communities. Chu became involved in politics fighting an English-only proposal for signs in her hometown, while Cedillo&rsquo;s signature bill would allow illegal immigrants to apply for driver&rsquo;s licenses, an idea he has pushed unsuccessfully for years.</p>
<p>Cedillo has the support of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which is eager to keep the seat in Hispanic hands.</p>
<p>For Hispanics, &#8220;a lot of our needs have not been met,&#8221; said Rep. Joe Baca, a Democrat and caucus member who represents a neighboring district. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a Hispanic seat. We should not lose that seat.&#8221;<br>

			<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a Hispanic seat.  We should not lose that seat&#8221;.  <br>
I know a Asian kid who lives in that area and complains about racism.  I asked him for examples and he gave me half a dozen times when nasty things were said to him.  Every time, it was Mexicans talking trash.  <br>
     The issue is, Asians are taking that part of Los Angeles County over.  Whenever a house is sold, the buyer is Asian.  The Mexicans don&rsquo;t like it, but they know that if it comes to a gang war, the Asians won&rsquo;t flinch.  </p>

			<p>This seat is in central Orange County, it covers part of Santa Ana, Huntington Beach, and Garden Grove.  I used to live there, when Loretta (illegal alien voters favorite) took the seat from Robert Dornan.</p>

			<p>There goes the neighbourhood, the third world asians are moving in. It is bad enough that so many hispanics are reducing America&rsquo;s standard of living but now another third bunch; the asians will make the area look like a toilet. </p>
<p>&#8220;Anonymous&#8221; in mind reckons the asians won&rsquo;t flinch in gang warfare against the hispanics. Asians are no way as tough as hispanics, many hispanic youth grow up tough not like the mother hounded asian kids.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for the great nation of the USA that was built by white Americans. The whites built the place and the rest have destroyed it including the asians.</p>

			<p>Maybe for fun some of AR&rsquo;s readers from the former Yugoslavia could comment on any similarities between their former fake state and the USA.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure MS-13 is quaking in their boots at thought of tussling with a group of CalTech computer programmers.</p>

			<p>Nicholas Folkes, if the Mexicans aren&rsquo;t afraid of getting into gang warfare with the Asians, why haven&rsquo;t they?  The Asians are taking over their neighborhoods, whole towns even, and raising property values so that Mexicans can&rsquo;t afford housing, and voting to spend money on improved schools that will teach Asian kids and leave the Mexicans behind.  In those schools, Asians take the hard classes and Mexicans drop out.  The commercial areas are separated into big new prosperous Asian stores and rundown little Mexican shops.  Everywhere they look, the Mexicans are faced with Asian superiority, the stage is set for conflict between the tough Mexicans and the &#8220;mother hounded&#8221; Asians, but it&rsquo;s not happening.  The Asians have guns and the Mexicans know it.  Remember the Korean shopkeepers defending their stores from rioters back in &#8216;91 or &#8216;92?  There are Asian gangs that have the sense and the discipline to keep a low profile, and they have money, computer expertise, and support from wiser minds.  A gang war between Asians and Mexicans would resemble Desert Storm.</p>

			<p>The former panderor was a horific Boxer-Pelosi suck up. An Asian may actually think before she or he votes and not worry about illeagal aliens except the ones comming in container cars from Hong Kong. Whenever you trade a 90 IQ for a 130 IQ it is a win win situation. Most Asian law makers are  more honest and smarter than whites. Since the Chineeze are going to take over our multi-cultural Eden before long, we might as well get used to being ruled by Mongolians.<br>
