<h1>SoCal Counties to Check Suspects&rsquo; Immigrant Status</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, May 13, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Law enforcement agencies in three Southern California counties will soon be able to check the immigration status of arrestees when their fingerprints are taken during booking.</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Wednesday the so-called &#8220;Secure Communities&#8221; program is scheduled to begin this month in Los Angeles, San Diego and Ventura counties.</p>
<p>David Venturella, ICE&rsquo;s executive director of the program, says the agencies will have access to federal criminal and immigration records after they take a suspect&rsquo;s fingerprints.</p>
<p>He says illegal immigrants who haven&rsquo;t had contact with the immigration system may not be flagged, but the goal is to deport the ones convicted of serious crimes.</p>
<p>The program is already used in 48 counties across the country.<br>

			<p>&#8220;He says illegal immigrants who haven&rsquo;t had contact with the immigration system may not be flagged, but the goal is to deport the ones convicted of serious crimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lots of luck.  </p>
<p>There is a book out, &#8220;The Deporter&#8221; by Ames Holbrook.  Holbrook was an INS agent who had the job of actually physically deporting illegal alien felons when they finished their prison terms.  Most of them stayed in America.</p>
<p>Here are the reasons they remained in America:</p>
<p>(1) The supreme court, led by Darth Vader Ginsburg ruled that if the illegal felons were not actually out of the country within 6 months of their release from prison they could stay.</p>
<p>(2) The Supreme court led by Ginsburg also ruled that INS agents could not simply pick them up at the prison and put them on a plane for their native country.  They could not be physically deported until an immigration INS Judge ordered them to be deported.</p>
<p>(3) If the illegal felon was ordered deported, he had the right to not one but several appeals.</p>
<p>(4) The immigration Judges are liberals who see themselves not as impartial Judges but as illegal alien felon&rsquo;s advocates.</p>
<p>(5) Federally funded attorneys and pro immigration groups managed to continue the hearings for more than 6 months.  Thus the illegal felons had to be released.</p>
<p>(6) It was not just the immigration attorneys who worked for the tax payer funded non profit law firms.  It was also the tax payer funded immigration advocate groups, usually connected with churches who kept appealing and appealing until the 6 months was up and the illegal felon was released on the street.</p>
<p>(7) On the few occasions when it was possible to deport the illegal felon there were more obstacles.</p>
<p>  (A) His own country had to accept him back.  Sometimes his     happened, sometimes not.  The acceptance had of course to be within the 6 month time frame.  These were terrible felons, murders, rapists etc.  Many countries are happy to dump them on America.</p>
<p>   (B) The airline had to accept him as a passenger.  The illegal felons would cause a huge scene at the airport, screaming, threatening, rolling on the ground etc.  Their friends and relatives and even tax payer funded immigration advocates would come to the airport and join in the screeching and howling. So he would not be allowed on the plane.</p>
<p>Because of this the Deporters kept the date and place of departure secret to avoid the family and friends riot at the departure gate.  At one time the Deporters sedated the illegal felon.</p>
<p>   (C) The federal Judiciary agreed with a joint ACLU ADL lawsuit that the illegal felons should not be sedated to get them through the airport and on the plane.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it works folks.  No matter what laws the people manage to pass, the federal Judiciary and the federally funded immigration lawyers, immigration advocates and ACLU, ADL etc will manage to get around it.</p>
<p><br>
We are taxed to pay for our own destruction.</p>
<p>Are we dumb or not?</p>
<p>Holbrook worked in New Orleans for a long time.  He thinks that part of the enormous crime rate in New Orleans is due to the large amount of illegal alien felons the New Orleans INS hearing Judges release into New Orleans.</p>
<p>The INS houses these illegal felons waiting to be deported in city and county jails and sometimes state prisons if the prisons are within reasonable distance of the INS deportation hearing offices.</p>
<p>The cost of housing these prisoners is substantially cheaper in the south than the midwest and northeast.  Louisianna is the cheapest of all the states.  So the feds send as many as possible to Southern Louisianna to be near the New Orleans hearing offices.</p>
<p>With the help of taxpayer funded non profits such as ACLU, they are not deported, but released into the streets of New Orleans to continue their criminal careers.</p>

			<p>Whites are not only taxed for their own destruction, they have been set up to even welcome it. Look at the self-hating Whites out there who have fallen for the lies and propaganda over the decades. Whites=evil&hellip;nonwhites=good. How many Whites out there even know what the ACLU/SPLC/AIPAC, etc really are?</p>

			<p>Oh, only the worst ones will be deported. I guess the ones that stole my car, broke the window of another car I have, and stole my expensive bike, aren&rsquo;t among those. Again, we have more traitors in California then any sensible person could imagine.</p>

			<p>Excellent post, Margaret.  There isn&rsquo;t much left to discuss about this issue.  It doesn&rsquo;t appear that Islamic terrorists or any anti-American group needs to do anything but wait.</p>
