<h1>Ex-Anchor Files Suit Against Fox29</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Klein, Philadelphia Inquirer, May 6, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his lawsuit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, Burlington [former Fox29 weekend anchor Tom Burlington, 41, of Malvern], who is white, asserts that he was subjected to a hostile work environment because of his race.</p>
<p>Burlington previously had filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which closed the case without issuing a determination.</p>
<p>In the suit, Burlington says that on June 23, 2007, he and about eight colleagues discussed plans for the evening&rsquo;s broadcast. Robin Taylor, a white reporter, mentioned her story, in which a youth council of the NAACP symbolically &#8220;buried&#8221; the racial epithet. In describing her story, Taylor used the phrase &#8220;n-word&#8221; and not the epithet, says the complaint, filed against Fox and its parent company, News Corp., by Center City lawyer Stephen Console.</p>
<p>Burlington said he told Taylor that using the phrase and not simply the word in her report &#8220;ultimately gives the word itself more power.&#8221;</p>
<p>Burlington uttered the word during the meeting and noticed that producer Nicole Wolfe, who is African American, &#8220;seemed uncomfortable,&#8221; the complaint says. He later apologized to her, it says.</p>
<p>About an hour later, the complaint says, anchor Joyce Evans, who is African American and who was not at the meeting, told Burlington that he had offended some people.</p>
<p>Burlington&rsquo;s complaint says that he apologized to those who were at the meeting and that Wolfe was the only worker who told him she had been offended. Burlington said he &#8220;did not in any way intend his use of the word to be offensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the suit, Evans told Burlington that &#8220;he did not &#8216;get it&rsquo; regarding the use of the word&#8221; and that as a white person, &#8220;he was never permitted to use that word.&#8221; Taylor joined the conversation and agreed with Evans, the suit says. Evans herself used the word twice in that conversation, the complaint says.</p>
<p>About six days later, Burlington was called into a meeting with then-news director Phil Metlin and suspended.</p>
<p>Burlington says that on July 3, he was told that he could undergo sensitivity training and return to duty. {snip}</p>
<p>Burlington says that on July 11, the station&rsquo;s counselor found him fit to return to work. But the next day, station manager Mike Renda told him there was cause to terminate Burlington and offered him the opportunity to resign. Burlington said Renda cited the negative publicity and concerns for Burlington&rsquo;s safety. Both Renda and Metlin are white.</p>
<p>Burlington&rsquo;s suspension was not lifted, and he was terminated at the end of his contract, on Feb. 19, 2008.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Burlington uttered the word during the meeting and noticed that producer Nicole Wolfe, who is African American, &ldquo;seemed uncomfortable,&rdquo; the complaint says. He later apologized to her, it says.</p>
<p>Nicole Wolf is an affirmative action hire that has to be guided in almost all her work by assistants.  I hope the station continues to make money, because if it doesn&rsquo;t Nicole Wolf is going to have to perform on her own, and she can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>The economic cut back may turn out to be the greatest disaster of AA everywhere.</p>

			<p>As usual, the wrong person is sent to &#8216;sensitivity&rsquo; training. And in this case the wrong person is fired. Just what is it that&rsquo;s insensitive to whites? Most of these very same &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; people use the word &#8216;redneck&rsquo;, a racial slur, in an attempt to prove to everyone how enlightened they are. </p>
<p>The most interesting thing in this case is Burlington, the guy who was fired, arguing that using this or that &#8216;ultimately gives the word more power&rsquo;. My what a meeting of intellect and enlightenment that must have been. </p>

			<p>Sounds like a hostile work environment to me.  A black woman stating point blank to a white man that whites are not allowed to say any certain word is racial discrimination. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine working in a news gathering organization with blacks. A black anchor is nothing more than a signal to change the channel.</p>

			<p>no, no, this is wonderful because for years it was the news media leading the charge for political correctness. i hope every newroom in america is filled with blacks. these white liberals brought it on themselves&hellip;this guy tom burlington is one of them, by saying, using the phrase and not the word gives it more power,. dont you see he is one of them, rejoice. political correctness has turned full circle&hellip;integrate cape cod so kennedy can get a taste of his own medicine.</p>

			<p>To repeat, blacks are terrible, terrible employees because they will sooner or later, file suit against the company.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Evans told Burlington &hellip; that as a white person, &#8216;&ldquo;he was never permitted to use that word.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And are you not utterly astounded at the suggestion that certain words in the English language (a White language, I might unnecessarily add) are permitted for blacks but verboten for Whites?</p>

			<p>Does everyone notice how when Whites use politicaly incorrect terms, they &#8220;utter&#8221; or &#8220;spew&#8221; them?</p>

			<p>well, what are we going to do?  I say let&rsquo;s send a message and go after their advertisers and boycott their products until the station rehires him.</p>

			<p>Only Blacks can use the &#8220;n-word&#8221;?  Whites are never allowed to utter it?  Blacks need to deal with their own racism before they judge others.  I say that Blacks are never allowed to utter the words &#8220;White boy, White girl, white bread, cracker, honkie, White trash&#8221; or &#8220;redneck&#8221;.  Those are words that only Whites can utter.  And while we are at it, Mestizos are forbidden from saying &#8220;Gringo.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whites need to speak out when blacks and browns and white liberals throw around these anti-white slurs. Another one the Democrats like is &#8220;people who look like you.&#8221; </p>

			<p>Even the Weather Channel is now politically/Socially correct in that the team now (usually) consists of a black male quipping with a White female. Subliminal messaging must work.</p>

<p>No surprising.  As someone who has dealt with EEO, I know that a white male&rsquo;s complaint is viewed as something rather bizarre by the minority females and blacks who run the place. They simply don&rsquo;t take it seriously.  It&rsquo;s evident that they think &#8220;equal opportunity&#8221; is exclusively  meant for THEM, not YOU. It is a waste going to EEO.</p>
