<h1>8 Rape Charges Tossed in Fatal Carjacking of Knoxville Couple</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamie Satterfield, Knoxville News Sentinel, May 29, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>State prosecutors agreed this morning to slim down the 41-count indictment in a fatal carjacking, tossing out eight rape counts.</p>
<p>Assistant District Attorney General Leland Price agreed to merge 16 rape charges into a bundle of eight after Criminal Court Judge Richard Baumgartner pointed out they were duplicative.</p>
<p>The rape counts at issue allege, in the first eight rape charges, that the rapes were carried out through the use of force. The second set of eight charges allege the same rapes were carried out through coercion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any real difference in the outcome of the case, however. If the suspects had been convicted of all 16 rapes, the law would require the judge to merge those anyway.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Thursday, Baumgartner said in an order that he was forced to delay two trials in the torture-slayings of Channon Christian, 21, and Christopher Newsom, 23, in part because of the prosecution&rsquo;s delay in turning over a document that declares one suspect blameless in the case.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

								<h2>Trials in Fatal Christian-Newsom Carjacking Delayed</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Jamie Satterfield, Knoxville News Sentinel, May 28, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Criminal Court Judge Richard Baumgartner ruled that Letalvis Cobbins will not be tried [In the Christian-Newsom fatal carjacking] July 6, as scheduled, but instead will face trial on Aug. 12.</p>
<p>The decision essentially delays the remaining three trials set for Cobbins&rsquo; co-defendants, all of whom are being tried separately in the torture slayings of University of Tennessee student Channon Christian, 21, and her boyfriend Christopher Newsom, 23.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chief among his [the judge&rsquo;s] concerns is a pending motion to dismiss the case against Cobbins&rsquo; girlfriend, Vanessa Coleman, 21. Cobbins, 26, wants to use her as a witness, but she almost certainly would invoke her right against self-incrimination if charges against her were still in place.</p>
<p>Baumgartner said until he resolves that motion, Cobbins&rsquo; case is a bit in limbo.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cobbins&rsquo; new trial date of Aug. 12 is two days after Coleman would have been tried, so Baumgartner in his order also canceled Coleman&rsquo;s trial date.</p>

<p>With a headline title such as this, one might deduct that a possible homicide occured but have no idea of the atrocities done to these people. Sadly, this case is going to be turned into a black circus with the usual protesters, riots, threats to VOTEMOUT directed at the White politicians and they (politicians) will cave in and settle for, perhaps &#8220;wrongful death&#8221; charges, slapping each other on the backs for a &#8216;conviction.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>On the days that the Knoxville News Sentinel runs an article on this case (like today, and the last couple of days), a courtroom photo showing some of the defendants often appears on the site&rsquo;s home page:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been posting and reading the comments at this site for about a year. All the local people that post are extremely disturbed by the crime, and I&rsquo;d say that over half (just my guess) see a racial dimension to the case.</p>

		<p>Today&rsquo;s article on the case in the Knoxville News Sentinel (it&rsquo;s not on the aspect of the case they&rsquo;d forecast for today&rsquo;s article, that one of the defendants, Vanessa Coleman, may possibly walk):</p>
<p>&#8220;Attorney&rsquo;s Role Questioned&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A prosecutor warned Friday that a Kentucky attorney hired to represent the lone female suspect in a carjacking turned torture slaying might not be qualified under Tennessee law to handle a capital case.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/may/30/attorneys-role-questioned/</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been many delays in the cases, over which the posters at the site have expressed much frustration (posting angry comments on the order of, just turn them loose and everything will be taken care of), and other posters have said is just normal judicial procedure in capital cases.</p>
<p>Certainly the defense teams seem to be trying every possible strategem:</p>
<p>&#8220;state prosecutors this week are trying to block defense attorneys from trying to convince jurors that the costs of putting their clients to death are too high to justify.&#8221;</p>

<p>As libertarian columnist Vin Suprynowicz says, &#8220;voir dire&#8221; is French for &#8220;jury stacking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Being white nationalists, I&rsquo;m sure most here have their differences with Suprynowicz, as do I, but when he&rsquo;s right, he&rsquo;s right.  </p>

		<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read, neither the parents of Newsom or Christian think this has anything to do race and don&rsquo;t want to make this &#8216;a racial issue&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s really hard for me to understand that even when your child has been SLAUGHTERED by these racist thugs, some Whites are so completely brainwashed as to ignore the racial angle of ANYTHING. If these kids were raised in that environment, is it any wonder that they were caught off guard and murdered. </p>

		<p>While this was a horrendous tragedy and the perpertrators should be prosecuted, the fact is that for every Shannon Christian and Christopher Newsom that have been murdered, there have been millions of Black Americans who have faced similar, horrific, sadistic murders at the hands of Whites. Where was the outcry when innocent Blacks were being, slaugthered, lynched and violently murdered? </p>

		<p>The real problem for Whites in this situation is that the only pro-White group that showed up to protest the cover-up of a race hate crime against Whites and the particularly gruesome aspects of it were Neo-Nazis, in all their garb, flags, etc.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s hard to believe is the lack of white rage as a result of this. Maybe this shows &#8220;how far we&rsquo;ve come as a group&#8221; over the past hundred years, since one cannot imagine such a crime taking place in the early 1900&rsquo;s and not resulting in a vigourous, vigilante type respons.</p>
<p>The only thing I am hoping is that the passivity resulting from this crime among my racial brethren has reached a low point, and that from here on out there will be a steady increase of those who are willing to defend white rights and not sit by and watch what&rsquo;s going on as if all were fictional events that don&rsquo;t affect them. We need a rapid return to racial identity politics, the same kind of politics all the rest of the minority groups in the U.S. play, and for youngsters of the age of those two horrendously killed in Knoxville and younger they better start thinking of themselves as a minority group, something which statistically will be the case within the next decade or so.<br>

<p>These type of violent black crimes are now routine against Whites in Canada and Britain and elsewhere. Since there was never any slavery, segregation, or &#8220;lynching&#8221; there, what is your excuse? For that matter there were never any blacks in those places either.</p>

<p>Oooooh, I dunno, maybe all throughout the 1920s, 1930s, 40s, and 50s by various hand-wringing groups of hand-wringing whites?  There&rsquo;s always been an &#8220;outcry&#8221; over the &#8220;horrific, sadistic&#8221; treatment of blacks on this continent, going as far back as the Northeastern Quakers in the 1600s.</p>
<p>And &#8220;millions&#8221;?  Try 3,400, distributed over a period from the end of the Civil War to 1956.</p>
<p>And how exactly do you know they were all &#8220;innocent&#8221;?  Out of 3000+, not one of them got his just desserts?<br>

<p>Nonsense.  For &#8220;every&#8221; Christian and Newsom?  So, many more than two million blacks have been raped and murdered by whites?  In the entire history of this country, there have not been so many.  Not even close.  Hyperbole does not constitute a coherent argument.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was the outcry when innocent Blacks were being, slaugthered, lynched and violently murdered?&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.  Most innocent blacks who are murdered are murdered by other blacks.  You want an outcry?  Cry away.  You&rsquo;re concerned about your people?  Fine.  No one is stopping you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m concerned about my people, and don&rsquo;t much care about yours.  I didn&rsquo;t used to feel this way, but now I do, and everyday, more and more whites begin to feel the same as I do.  The days when blacks could flim-flam us and pull on the old sympathy chain are fast coming to an end.  You&rsquo;d better get used to it.</p>

<p>Today, Black Americans kill far, far more Whites than the reverse. In the past, the amount of Blacks lynched and murdered by Whites, while it did exist and was certainly wrong, has been hugely blown out of proportion. Also, any atrocities done towards Blacks by Whites in the past has been and still is trumpted constantly while the reverse is largely ignored.</p>

		<p>The (INHUMAN)aspects of this case are repeated everyday in black on White crime. blacks seem to delight in the denigration of other races, their threatening eye contacts, their childlike behaviour is becoming far less intimidating to White People than it used to be. America was founded by White, Christian people, imperfect (for sure) but where else on this planet has anyone formed a society even close to the wonderful one we have enjoyed for so long? Nowhere is the answer and the worst part of this is we White Americans are allowing and even assisting people who would destroy our Great Country to take it over and destroy our Great Constitution with their demands for UNEARNED equality.</p>

<p>&#8220;ass&#8221; - out of &#8220;u&#8221;- and &#8220;me&#8221; &hellip;.  </p>
<p>Jill:</p>
<p>I am not justifying anything, certainly not a senseless crime as this one was. However, I still reiterate the point that if this had been a young Black couple who had been murdered by Whites, many people on this board would have ignroed the story, Amren would have never have posted the story and everything would be hum drum and business as usual. This is simply a fact.</p>

<p>By your logic you could make the case that some of the Whites who were murdered by Black got their just deserts.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;And &ldquo;millions&rdquo;? Try 3,400, distributed over a period from the end of the Civil War to 1956. And how exactly do you know they were all &ldquo;innocent&rdquo;? Out of 3000+, not one of them got his just desserts?&#8221;</p>
<p>The one lynched, actually shot and dumped in a creek was Emmett Till.  He was only 13, but he was 5ft8 150 pounds, 5 inches taller and 35 pds heavier than the White woman he raped.  there had been a lot of black on White rapes in the area.  Emmett came down from Chicago for summer vacation and bragged that in Chicago black men got away with raping White woman.</p>
<p>After Emmet&rsquo;s execution,black on White rapes stopped in the area for a few years.</p>
<p>Emmett&rsquo;s Father was one of the black rapist soldiers who raped Italian women during WW2.  He was hanged for 2 rapes and 1 murder of an Italian woman.  Some allies we were.</p>
<p>Just deserts.</p>

		<p>Regarding the claims of Tevin,</p>
<p>To all of you who read them&hellip; and who hear the violent racist lyrics of hip hop and rap&hellip; this is the common rhetoric characterizing a growing radical militant attitude amongst blacks in this country and Europe.  Black churches and other social focal points are fomenting rage and anger in the black community, in preparation for some sort of ethnopolitical objective in the near future.  I believe there is a race war coming in the future and what blacks did in Zimbabwe is what they want to do here.  I believe most of the black on white crimes occuring in this country are as much politically motivated as they are criminally motivated.  Especially the rapes of white women.</p>

		<p>Once these proto pre-caveman humanoids are found guilty beyond a reasonble doubt, there&rsquo;s no doubt what the state should do with them. Simply line them up against a wall and shoot them, without delay and with no mercy. Save the taxpayers the money of housing them and feeding them even for one day. </p>
