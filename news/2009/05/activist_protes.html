			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elgin Jones, South Florida Times (Miami), May 15, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A historic motel that served as a haven for black entertainers during segregation is now at the center of a racial-discrimination protest.</p>
<p>The Hampton House Motel, in Miami&rsquo;s predominantly black Brownsville section, was one of the places where famous black recording artists stayed during segregation after performing for all-white audiences on the beach. The performers were not allowed to stay in predominantly white hotels.</p>
<p>Miami-Dade County is restoring and renovating Hampton House after it fell into disrepair over the years. But ironically, the construction work on the black historic site does not include any black contractors, subcontractors or laborers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jobs for blacks in Miami are becoming an endangered species,&#8221; said Ken Knight, an activist and president of the Hadley Park/Model Cities</p>
<p>Homeowners Association in the Brownsville community. &#8220;The Hampton House belongs to the black community, and the black community should be the people who rebuild that particular site. This is our heritage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Knight is leading a battle to get blacks hired to perform work on the restoration of the historic black motel and nightclub, work that is being mostly performed with the use of tax dollars.</p>
<p>Knight is adamant that those involved in the project are brushing him off because they are uncomfortable discussing the issue, but some acknowledge the point he is trying to make.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Enid Pinkney, the founding president and CEO of the Historic Hampton House Community Trust, Inc., a non-profit organization formed in 2002, is charged with restoring the motel to its glory days.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pinkney said the company is only doing the structural stabilization. She said the major portion of the project has yet to go out to bid, and she hopes black contractors will be informed and will participate in that process.</p>
<p>She also said the work requires special skills.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to have workers who have specific training on historic sites,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They must know how to recognize what should be preserved, and what can be thrown out. The people who are working there right now have to have certain qualifications that will not endanger the application that we have [with the Department of the Interior].&#8221;</p>
<p>The Hampton House Motel, called Booker Terrace during segregation, is located at 4200 NW 27 Avenue. It opened its doors in 1954, and quickly became a haven for some of the country&rsquo;s most notable black athletes, musicians, movie stars and civil rights leaders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the time, black people were allowed to perform at white establishments, before all-white audiences, but they were prohibited from staying at motels or frequenting nightclubs on the east side of the railroad tracks or the beach. After completing their performances, many headed to the Hampton House to rest, and party.</p>

			<p>Who is actually doing the work?  Cheap labor &#8220;guest worker&#8221; Hispanics?  That would be my guess, considering it&rsquo;s Miami.  If I&rsquo;m right, then these black complainers only have the NAACP types to blame.  They&rsquo;re the ones who are for &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t get it. Although immigration hurts us all, it seems Blacks are the most at risk here. They are in the most direct competition with hispanics for many jobs. I&rsquo;ve worked in the construction industry for over 20 years and have witnessed nearly total displacement of Blacks by hispanics. I&rsquo;m referring to mainly laborers, concrete workers, bricklayers, carpenters. Now they&rsquo;re coming for my job&hellip;. electrician. Fortunately, I was able to move into the office, but that isn&rsquo;t an option for alot of my friends. When will the madness end?</p>

			<p>wookie,</p>
<p>Yup your right about blacks. But their attitude is that they&rsquo;re hurting White people, which of course, they are. But as you said, their hurting themselves more. But their hatred of us is so, that they just can&rsquo;t help themselves. They&rsquo;d rather cut off their nosed despite their face.</p>
<p>Another point if I may. Many of our young men aren&rsquo;t doing what they have to do either. They&rsquo;ve been taught from early childhood that to work with your hands is beneath their dignity and it shows. I don&rsquo;t like saying something like that about our own people, but i think it&rsquo;s pretty accurate.</p>

			<p>It is amazing to read that Hampton House belongs to the black community, yet had deteriorated so much over the years through neglect. It must have been the lack of someone to bankroll it. Now that there is money to made in repairing a derelict structure, blacks are coming out of the woodwork with claims that the jobs should be theirs exclusively. </p>
<p>The same claim that the hotel belongs to the black community would be made even if the area had not been black in its heyday. </p>

			<p>perhaps there are no qualified blacks willing to do the work, why should they??welfare and their women take care of their needs. Also, perhaps blacks weren&rsquo;t invited because someone wants to finish the job, within budget, on time and with a minimum of lawsuits and theft of materials.</p>

			<p>I live in KCMO and in the course of my job I deal with a few black business owners. Many of these black employers don&rsquo;t even hire other blacks these days. They actually prefer Hispanics. One told me about the only problem with Hispanic employees is that they want to work more hours than he could afford to pay.</p>

			<p>Black people working (even when well paid!) to preserve some of their own history? Nah. Won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>I relate a true story from sometime in the  mid to late 1980&rsquo;s or the early 1990&rsquo;s. To wit:</p>
<p>The east side of San Antonio,Texas is one of the historically black sections of the city. And back when what I&rsquo;m relating happened,an interesting even occurred. Several cemeteries made it into the newspapers and the local news channels,because they were black cemeteries that had long since fallen by the wayside and were being neglected.</p>
<p>These cemeteries had originally been the property of black fraternal lodges. Burial in a lodge cemetery was only one of a number of advantages that were to be gained by membership in a fraternal organization,and these brotherhoods were naturally reasonably popular.</p>
<p>However,time goes on,and these organizations had sadly,withered and eventually passed away. The thing is,the cemeteries were still there,although they had-if memory serves-mostly been classified as abandoned,and taken over by the city or county for back taxes,or something like that. (I&rsquo;m no longer certain of the exact details) And these cemeteries were-it must be admitted-sadly neglected,overgrown,and probably rightly thought of by at least a few people as potential dangers.</p>
<p>So along came a black minister. And he started agitating for some attention to be paid to these cemeteries,which was laudable,but there was one big catch to his efforts-</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t want to do any of the work himself. He wanted the City of San Antonio to perform and pay for any work done to maintain these old burial grounds. I remember watching him being interviewed on a local newscast,and I sat there shaking my head at both the entitlement mentality,and the opportunity being lost here. Think about it-</p>
<p>One Sunday,this minister could have gone in front of his congregation and said something along the lines of:</p>
<p>&#8220;Next Sunday,there will be no services here. We will congregate at such-and-such a cemetery,attired in work clothes. The men will bring their rakes,shovels,and other implements as may be required. The women will bring food in the quantities needed to feed themselves and their families for a day of work. And we will then proceed to clean up that cemetery,because it needs doing,and no one else is doing it. And when we are done with the first cemetery,we will start the next,until there are no more of these cemeteries that need cleaning. And after that,we will keep them clean,for these are our people who rest there.&#8221;</p>
<p>A great plan,or at least that&rsquo;s what I thought to myself. The congregation gets some exercise and fresh air,the cemetery gets cleaned up,and everyone gets a chance to learn a little bit of local history.</p>
<p>But why do something yourself when you can get it done at the expense of taxpayers?</p>

			<p>Perhaps the people who want the hotel restored want the job done to standard, on time, and cheap. Three terms that few, if any, Black construction firms understand! </p>
<p>As an aside   &mdash;   Miami is chock full of dramatically overpriced option ARMs real estate which will completely collapse within the next two years.</p>
<p>Miami is primed to become one of the nation&rsquo;s real hot spot infernos in 20010 and I&rsquo;m not talking about the weather here either. Better be getting those FEMA camps ready.</p>
<p>Hispanics + Blacks + Depression + Crime = Explosion! </p>

			<p>Maybe they should get oprah winfrey to ask for &#8220;donations&#8221;.  Of course, she could help &#8220;her own people&#8221; here instead of &#8220;helping&#8221; her people in africa.</p>
