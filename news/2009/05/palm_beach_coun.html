<h1>Palm Beach County Has First All-Latino Boy Scout Troop; Girl Scouts Sell Dulce De Leche Cookies to Reach Hispanics</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alexia Campbell, Palm Beach Post, May 7, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Boy Scouts turned Richard Hernandez from a gang leader into a troop leader. Now, the tattooed 28-year-old Eagle Scout wants to make sure Hispanic youths don&rsquo;t make the same mistakes he did.</p>
<p>Hernandez is helping create the first all-Latino Boy Scout troop in Palm Beach County. He&rsquo;s the kind of guy the Boy Scouts are looking for to keep the 99-year-old Scouting tradition alive. The country&rsquo;s population is changing, and Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts feel they need to change too if they want to keep bringing in new members. They&rsquo;re reaching out to the Hispanic community to grow along with the booming minority population.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re changing with the times,&#8221; said Marcos Nava, national director of Hispanic initiatives for the Boy Scouts of America. &#8220;We mostly serve white, middle-class families and we&rsquo;re not staying in par with the growth in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Boy Scouts of America launched a $1 million pilot program this year to boost Hispanic membership in six U.S. cities, including Orlando. It&rsquo;s the national council&rsquo;s latest effort to attract minority groups and the plan is to double Hispanic membership over the next year through bilingual outreach to parents and community leaders. Recent numbers show that Hispanic Boy Scouts make up about 3 percent of the nation&rsquo;s 3 million Scouts. {snip}</p>
<p>Partnering with community groups and churches is key, local Scouting officials say. At the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints where Hernandez volunteers in Lake Clarke Shores, about 20 Hispanic boys play soccer and basketball after school every Wednesday. Most come from low-income immigrant families. They are also at risk of joining gangs, said Israel Calderon, who leads the church&rsquo;s group for young men.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The traditional all-American image of the Girls Scouts in South Florida is also shifting. This year, Broward Girl Scout troops sold dulce de leche cookies outside supermarkets along with the usual Thin Mints and Samoas.</p>
<p>Broward troops have started to reflect the area&rsquo;s ethnic diversity, said Sonia Malter, who leads a Junior Girl Scout troop in Weston. Years ago, only one or two girls in her troop were Hispanic, now she has four. However, more still needs to be done, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s no longer that one Anglo look; it&rsquo;s all looks. It&rsquo;s very exciting,&#8221; said Malter, whose family is from Costa Rica and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Girls Scouts of Southeast Florida had nearly 16 percent Hispanic membership, not including adults. They just received a $102,500 grant from the national council to recruit more bilingual volunteers in Broward County. The council plans to partner with local professional and church groups to find them. Getting bilingual adults involved in Scouting is essential to reach out to Spanish-speaking parents who might not understand what Scouting offers, said Lisa Johnson, spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida.</p>

		<p>When did the Boy Scouts start allowing known gang bangers to become Eagle Scouts much less scout leaders?  I suppose diversity is more important than anything.  Somehow, I doubt this new scout troop will be as adept as the ones in western Iowa last year when the scout camp took a direct tornado hit.</p>

		<p>I wonder when people will realize we&rsquo;re being taken over.<br>
Demography is destiny.<br>
I was behind a school bus yesterday in the small logging town in NW Washington state where I&rsquo;ve always lived.  At one stop, three Mexican children got off the bus, followed by one white girl.  The three Mexican children all walked together.  The white girl was ignored.   <br>
That is the future of the US  &mdash;  out-numbered by Mexicans 3 to 1, and made a minority.  It is an absolute, mathematical certainty.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really disappointing to see the racist attitude in non-white kids, taught to them by their parents, their leaders and self-hating white liberals in the school system.</p>
<p>Non-whites are the first to screech about white biases, and, at the same time, they aren&rsquo;t bright enough to understand that their actions and rhetoric are far, far more racist.  The racist language they use every day to denigrate white people is hypocritical.</p>
<p>The encouragement of non-white supremacy is beginning to be a very militant movement in this country.</p>

		<p>South Florida is a foriegn nation on American soil. I find this to be an unacceptable state of affairs. The cubans are in-your-face arrogant about their conquest of South Florida. WE should&rsquo;t tolerate this. The cubans should be booted out of South Florida.I no more  want a cuban colinization of South Florida than I would want a Bulgarian colonization of South Florida. They are not our kind.</p>
<p>Vdare.com has been completely silent about the shennanigans of the cubans down in South Florida. This is rather strange since vdare.com is the premier-flag ship immigration reform organization.</p>
<p>By the way, numbersusa.com stil refuses to acknowledge that Native Born White Americans exist. Send your $$$$ to American Renassaince instead.</p>

<p>One of the fruits of multiculturalism and loss of power by the once dominant culture. However, the statement isn&rsquo;t an example of racism. (Sure)</p>

		<p>An all-white Scout Troop would probably be investigated by the Boy Scouts of America and would probably be monitored by the SPLC as a potential &#8220;hate group.&#8221; Meanwhile, an all-Latino Scout troop is greeted with praise and positive headlines.  Don&rsquo;t you just love &#8220;multiculturalism.&#8221;</p>

		<p>How will they reconcile court decisions regarding the Scouts, homophobia, and all Hispanic troops? The bigger plan is Mexican soccer team based troops.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s exciting all right.  And when the country is filled with hispanics, America will look and run like a thrid-world banana republic. Plenty of crime, poverty, corruption, litter, graffitti, drugs, and teenage pregnancies.  Kind of like how much of Los Angeles looks now.</p>

		<p>I wonder, is he still a gang leader as well? Don&rsquo;t gangs normally kill members that quit the gang? When is he going to have his gang tattoos removed? What about past crimes that he has committed?   </p>
<p>If he has really gone straight and turned his life around, that is great and I wish him all the best. He can do a lot of good for these kids.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just it, they know full well that they are being racist and hypocritical. The reality is, they don&rsquo;t care. Since they are allowed to recognize and have a sense of pride in themselves as a people, they have no &#8220;white guilt&#8221; to manipulate. They are immune to cries of racism. If your team is winning by cheating and the other team says nothing, what are you going to do, call foul on yourself? </p>
