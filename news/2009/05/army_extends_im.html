<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-immigrant-recruits4-2009may04,0,5003914.story">Army Extends Immigrant Recruiting</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alexandra Zavis and Andrew Becker, Los Angeles Times, May 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But starting today, 10 Los Angeles-area Army recruiting offices will begin taking applications from some foreigners who are here on temporary visas or who have been granted asylum.</p>
<p>In all, the pilot program, which was launched in New York in February, seeks to enlist 1,000 military recruits with special language and medical skills, most of whom will join the Army. Response to the program has exceeded expectations, drawing applications from more than 7,000 people around the country, many of them highly educated, defense officials said.</p>
<p>Those who are accepted will get an expedited path to citizenship in return for their service. {snip}</p>
<p>The Army requested that applicants&rsquo; full names not be used because, in some cases, it could put them or family members at risk in their home countries.</p>
<p>Although the Army has been meeting or exceeding its recruiting goals, defense officials say there is a shortage of soldiers with medical, foreign language and cultural abilities needed in the war on terror and peacekeeping efforts around the world.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Army hopes to enlist 333 healthcare professionals, including doctors, dentists, nurses and others. It is also looking for 557 people with any of 35 languages, including Arabic and Yoruba, spoken in West Africa. Spanish is not on the list. An additional 110 slots are earmarked for other services, which have not yet started taking applications for the program.</p>
<p>Although the effort is limited in scope, it has raised concerns among some veterans groups and advocates for tighter immigration controls. They question whether the policy shift could pave the way for large numbers of foreigners, including ones who might have entered the U.S. illegally, to join the armed services.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Defense officials emphasize that the program is only open to foreigners who have lived legally in the U.S. for at least two years, including students, some professionals and refugees.</p>
<p>Those who enlist are required to meet the same physical and conduct standards as other recruits and exceed the educational standards. They are also vetted by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, and they will not be granted waivers for any criminal offenses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By extending the program to Los Angeles, Army officials hope to make it easier for applicants on the West Coast to be considered and to ease the pressure on New York recruiters.</p>
<p>They also want to reach a broader range of language experts. So far, most of the recruits have been Korean, Indian and Chinese language speakers. The Army needs more people with languages used in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran, among others. Only four of the recruits enlisted as Arabic speakers, one speaks Urdu and one speaks Punjabi.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To retain their citizenship, participants must honorably complete at least five years of service.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m all for using foreigners for the armed forces.  Too many young white lives have been lost in wars that should have never been fought.</p>
<p>The military has already degenerated badly with an excess of political correctness, it&rsquo;s really slowly becoming a third world force, with the exception of the special forces units and a few other units not yet compromised.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t look for that to last long.  Blacks can&rsquo;t cut the mental requirements for special ops, so it&rsquo;s a foregone conclusion standards will be dumbed down to accommodate them as everything else has been.</p>
<p>When The Disaster hits us on the battlefield due to non-white incompetence, I can guarantee that the brass, the leftist politicians and the radical media will be spinning another reason as to the reasons for the failure just as they tried to do to blame someone else besides the non-white subprimers and their leftist advocates for our economic collapse.</p>
<p>The brass has already drastically lowered standards for officers.  It&rsquo;s too bad, but the proud military is now rife with affirmative action.  The whole affair has turned into a recipe for our next disaster.</p>

		<p>This is starting to remind me a lot of ancient Rome with its policy of recruiting barbarians (largely Germanic)from beyond the empire&rsquo;s fringe into the ranks of the legions. It proved to be a catastrophic decision. </p>

<p>And  those who do not understand history, are forced to repeat it!</p>
<p>I wonder how in-depth, most of our so-called &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; have studied the rise and fall of the Roman Empire?  Just what percentage of the vast legions of Rome, were outlanders and other aliens at the time of the fall?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!!</p>

		<p>Question: Why would the U.S. government be so eager to hire non-citizens to fill our armed forces?</p>
<p>Answer: There is the possibility (or probability) that non-citizens (or ones that don&rsquo;t look or act like us OR have an ax to grind) may be a little more willing to fire on us.</p>
<p>Never underestimate the intentions of our corrupted leaders!<br>

		<p>A few years ago, a West African youth was quoted by an American reporter as saying he hoped the U.S. military would intervene in his country, because he would like to get to America by joining the Marines!</p>
<p>Despite illiteracy and poor communications, news of this program has been circulating in the impoverished Third World for years.   </p>

		<p>Just wait until the final excuse for martial law is finally made.  Then, we will have troops who hardly speak English knocking on our doors to search for illegal weapons, etc.  They won&rsquo;t know much about the Second Amendment either because they were put on the &#8220;fast track to citizenship.&#8221;  I predict a military takeover of the U.S. within fifty years led by a non-European surnamed general.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t laugh, there was a mutiny in the Army earlier this week in Georgia.  It was quickly ended, but it happened.  The news barely got notice.</p>

<p>I witnessed a mutiny by black soldiers in Viet-Nam once. A large number of them had barricaded themselves in a wooden barracks and threatened to kill anyone who came in, any WHITES that is. We (a LRRP patrol) watched, and had I been the commander I would have fired the building and shot them all as they came out, there would have been no survivors.</p>

		<p>I heard Ugandans are being recruited for the AFRICOM det and again, a fast track to citizenship is said to be offered. I already know for sure that Ugandans are being used as security on U.S. military bases in Iraq and they all have M-4s, you know!! the better M-16 derivitive that the government says we don&rsquo;t have enough of to equip our own troops with!! maybe we could get some from Uganda or the PLO!! Or better yet, Czech manufactured AK-47s or AK-74s a better weapon anyway.</p>

<p>This is a White Nationalist web site. WE oppose racially transformingthe US millitary by through importing foriegners who will receive weapons training and one day-one Native Born White Americans are racially minority-turn their m-16s on Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>If the United States Marine Corp had its-and it may get its way- the marines would be 100 percent hispanic-mexican variety. I have come to despise the US marines. </p>
<p>The size of the US military should be cut in half. The US military has almost othing to do with the defense of ordinary Americans. If the US military was cut in half, ther would be much les death and destruction in the world. The US military exists soley to increase the bank accounts of the CEOs of the military industrial complex. The US military for the past ten years has been antagonizing both China and Russia. Both China and Russian have both used great restraint. </p>
<p>As I have mentioned many times before here:US military aggression against other nations goes-hand-in-hand with the racial transformation of America via post-1965 immigration policy. They are inseparable.</p>
<p>I thoroughly despise the US military. And no&hellip;I do not support the troops- especially the non-white ones. Supporting the troops means supporting suporting war crimes committed by the US military. I support legitmate self-defense  not Republican and Democartic party wars of aggression. &#8220;War is a Racket&#8221; </p>
<p>By the way Ranger, you are a race traitor.</p>

		<p>If the USA had a normal &#8220;defense&#8221; policy it wouldn&rsquo;t need a fifth the armed forces it has now. But the American foreign policy &#8220;elites&#8221; are committed to a policy of global interventionism around the world, not to defending America.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re not exactly looking for soldiers are they? Nurses, dentists, translators&hellip; It looks like its more of a skills shortage. I suspect most of these recruited specialists will be of Indian descent. If the army needs them, then there shouldn&rsquo;t be any problem about it.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m always hearing from the opposition that any white who fears the disposession and disenfranchisement of their race is xenophobic, paranoid, or racist, etc.</p>
<p>I always respond back with the same lines.  Well, minorities are alreading changing the names of our schools, voting in their &#8220;own&#8221; people with their &#8220;own&#8221; agendas, hiring their &#8220;own&#8221; people, among many other things.  To me, that is proof positive we are being overtaken.  Besides, what if I&rsquo;m right?   Do you have a backup plan?  I get a blank stare.<br>

<p>You despise the military, and yet you conclude I&rsquo;m a race traitor?  Sounds pretty dumb to me.</p>
<p>If the charge were coming from anybody but you I&rsquo;d take it seriously, but your posts are so bizarre and ludicrous that this is just more of the same.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you&rsquo;d like to elaborate on your charges, please outline them to me in an email, because it would be off-topic on this forum. </p>

		<p>At least the military recruiters are not shanghaing right off the boat them  as the federal draft authorities did to the European immigrants during the Civil War.</p>
<p>We nationalists may not like it, but this kind of thing has been going on for all of human history.  With our own American young people being brainwashed with anti Americanism by the feminazis and other eviliberals from kindergarten through grad school, many young Americans are reluctant to enlist in the army of the Great Satan.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Yoruba, spoken in West Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Are we planning to invade West Africa next?  Isn&rsquo;t Yoruba one of the main languages of Nigeria, a major oil country? Wonder why we might want to invade Nigeria?  Must be some human rights violations going in the oil fields on that only a full scale invasion by the US military can help.</p>
<p>Were I a foreign diplomat or spy stationed in Washington DC or the United Nations, I would monitor what languages the military was looking for.  Then I would know what country was next on the list to be invaded by the US military. </p>

<p>First of all, you&rsquo;re speaking for the entire white nationalist movement when you allege something preceded by &#8220;we.&#8221;  Please don&rsquo;t include me in your circle.  I want nothing to do with unreasonable screeching, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure nobody else does either. </p>
<p>Certainly you speak only for yourself.  The fanaticism you display here is EXACTLY what our enemies use to demonize us, trying to depict us as unreasonable hate-mongers, when the vast majority aren&rsquo;t even close to somebody like you.  Too, don&rsquo;t your realize your unreasonable, argumentative insults delight our detractors to no end?  They love to read us bickering among ourselves and many post on here with the intent of getting that very thing started.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you are not typical of the people on this site.  Earlier you were shreiking hysterically about people here being traitors because they advocated secession, and you preferred to inanely work toward the physical ouster of 100 million non-whites in this country and wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate anything less.  Don&rsquo;t you realize the absurdity of your statements?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s people like you who make it hard for the rest of us to be taken seriously, and it brings great harm to Amren as well.</p>
<p>Can you imagine Jared Taylor being on a radio interview with a leftist and the first thing he quotes are comments like yours about being race traitors if secession is advocated?  It would be almost impossible for him to justify such rabid fanaticism.</p>
<p>The interviewer would point to comments like yours and say, See, Mr. Taylor, your organization is comprised of people who advocate unreasonable hatred, even of their own people if they do not agree with their unreasonableness. It takes a lot of guts to defend race realism/white nationalism publicly and it&rsquo;s unnecessarily more difficult when we have people illogically spewing hatred as you do.</p>
<p>If you have a position against secession or something else, can&rsquo;t you outline a logical argument against it instead of ranting hysterically and calling people names?</p>

<p>Who cares?  The military is part of the American government, the major enemy of White Americans since 1955.  Maybe we can&rsquo;t take back America, but we can at least sit back and enjoy the destruction of our military and everything else by feminazis and minorities.</p>
<p>White Americans are the equivalent of 1920&rsquo;s and 30&rsquo;s Ukranians in Russia and European Jews during Hitler&rsquo;s time.  The Ukranians who survived the commie genocide welcomed the German invaders.  The European Jews welcomed the invading allied armies.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t Gothic slaves secretly open the gates of Rome to the invading Goths in the late 400&rsquo;s AD?  I think so.</p>
<p>Why any racially conscious White cares about the future of this country which is in the process of exterminating us I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like Russia in soviet times when kulaks and others could save themselves and their families by joining the communist party, or 1550 to 1900 time when Irish Catholics could preserve their property and their civil rights by converting to the Anglican church.  </p>
<p>Our government&rsquo;s war against us is a racial war. We have lost the war. All we can do is sit back and enjoy the destruction.<br>

<p>We already have 4ft8 South. American Indians who speak neither Spanish nor English but Indian languages working as security guards in government buildings all over America.</p>
<p>The also work in medical records warehouses for  Iron Mountain one of the largest records storage companies in the country.  It&rsquo;s not just medical records, it is government records, legal records, insurance company records etc, all in the hands of illiterate in any language invaders.</p>

<p>I stand corrected. Your first line in your post jumped out at me. I get the gist of your post.</p>
<p>Just so you know: I was assaulted by a LEGAL IMMIGRANT, who, when he was right off the boat, was allowed in the US military-US Navy in particular. He was transitioning between jobs and worked as a home health aid worker taking care of a quadraplegic and dying family member. This family menmber kept him around because he was big and strong-6&rsquo;4&#8221; and muscular. Over the course of two weeks;he put his hands around my neck; shadowed boxed with his shirt of next to the hospital bed;complained that he hadn&rsquo;t beaten anyone up in awhile and urinated with the bathroom door open side view fully exposed in a home with two teenage girls and a five year boy. One day he began to throw half speed kung fu kicks to my head&hellip;reached my limit and broke his nose and almost knocked him out. He was from a west african country.</p>
<p>So you see ranger, I am hypersensitive to stuff like &#8220;let the foreigners into the military.&#8221; I could have been murderd in this family members  home. Anyhow, I apologize for my stupid comments.</p>
<p>I wright from personal experience. I have no respect for econometrics and econometricians.  On the immigration-race replacement issue, I do not defer to them as the final word. No Native Born White American should. I now from first hand experience the real facts about post 1965 immigration policy. There are millions of Native Born White Americns who haven&rsquo;t a clue as to what awaits them in the very near future.</p>

<p>I think it is a very good idea to let immigration enthusiasts know in no uncertain terms there there is growing rage and anger towards post-1965 immigration policy in the American Heartland. Perhaps they will rethink forcing race-replacement on US.</p>
<p>If Jared Taylor is asked by a reporter &#8220;what about those racists comments on your website&#8221; Jared shoould turn the tables on the reportr on other immigration enthusiasts. I hope these radio hosts and &#8220;journalists&#8221; do exactly what you are afriad they will do. Lots of FREE publicity for the White Nationalist cause&hellip;WE can then reach a much larger Native Born White American audience. In the interview, Jared can give a long list of racists comments from hispanic spokesman such as Geraldo Rivera who publicly wishes for the reduction of Native Born White American majority  to an ever-dwindling racial minority  withn the borders of America.Why isn&rsquo;t that considerd racist within the  Liberal even-handed framework. Why should White Americans be in favor of being made a racial minority withn the borders of America post-1965 immigration policy? Or he can pretend that Native Born White Americns do not exist like numbersusa.com does all the time.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I now from first hand experience the real facts about post 1965 immigration policy. – Jupiter&rdquo;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re aware, then, that &ldquo;Hispanics,&rdquo; primarily Chicanos, pose the greatest threat to the North American continent. There is no  between North America and Central/South America.  There is an ocean between San Francisco and China.  The Asians living in Silicon Valley are part of the technocracy.  They are a minority within the state.  They come here via H1b visas.  More immediately worrisome are the &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; Mexican landscapers mowing technocratic lawns.</p>
<p>Worried about crime?  Look to the Chicanos.  Worried about property values?  Look to the Chicanos.  Worried about the preservation of all of that wonderful military, industrial, and government infrastructure?  Look to the Chicanos.  </p>
<p>Who was responsible for bringing racial diversity to this continent in the first place?  Why, the very people who financed and contracted for the construction of this &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; infrastructure – wealthy European-American Christians and others with funds provided by greedy, middle-class European-American &ldquo;investors&rdquo; – that&rsquo;s who!  </p>
<p>Remember the &lsquo;80&rsquo;s when almost every middle-class European-American in the country bragged about his investment &ldquo;portfolio&rdquo; on a near daily basis?  (Some even adopted a pseudo-aristocratic British accent?)  I do.  It was all about Good Times!  Easy money!  No work required!  Spring forward to 2009 and it would appear that the lust for easy money has finally bitten greedy middle-class European-Americans on the butt.</p>
<p>Angry about that legal immigrant from West Africa?  Look to yourself and your easy money investments, first.  That is what genuine White nationalism should be about.  Anything else is parasitic economic &ldquo;conservatism&rdquo; tinged with racial supremacy.</p>

<p>Why indeed?  In our greedy, short-sighted pursuit of easy money we are, after all, the fools who acquiesced to bringing non-Whites to this country in the first place.  And don&rsquo;t say we didn&rsquo;t know what was going on.  Even our dumbest are cognizant of the fact that hiring Mexicans on the cheap for domestic chores has been popular for decades.  We have been fully complicit in the destruction of our working-class.  Whites, both liberal and &ldquo;conservative,&rdquo; are endangered because we tend to be lazy, cowardly, status-hungry, and self-deceiving.  Coming to grips with this is the first thing needed to ensure our survival.</p>

<p>I do not agree with you. Post-1965 asian &#8220;Americans&#8221; are as much of a threat to Native Born White Americans as hispanics are.</p>
<p>My late Irish Catholic father-father of seven, a vet amd mechanical engineer(space program and defense)-along with thousands of other Native Born White American Men with families were thrown out of work and replaced with asian scab labor.</p>
<p>It is a bold face lie to claim as you do that without the post-1965 asians,America could not be technological giant. We managed to put 12 Native Born White Men on the moon without the help of the asians. This fact seems to bother some people-asians,leftists,liberals, the Bush family and the anti-white Kenyan bigot foreigner Barack Obama&hellip;.and you GT.</p>
<p>How did Native Born White Amreican ever manage when asian LEGAL immigration was very low? Quite well thank you.</p>
<p>GT. if you are White American, you are a race traitor. This is staement I will not retract. Asian LEGAL IMMIGRANTS are a mortal threat to Native Born White American families.</p>
<p>The land grant  university that I attended-whose construction my parents,grandparents and great grand parents-all veterans of the US military-is now a monument to China. You apprently have no problem with this.</p>
<p>Asian LEGAL immigrants are actively participating in the destruction of centuries of collective engineering experience tht resides in the brians of Native Born White America. This is in the realm of genocide. This doesn&rsquo;t bother Steve Sailer. But it angers me. MY late father was complaining about the importaion of LEGAL immigrant asian engineers-bitterly -two weeks before he died.<br>

<p>That is not what I am claiming.</p>
<p>Chicanos and Asians are here because of European-American complicity in both the passage and financial aftermath of the 1965 Immigration Act.  Due to our greed for unearned &#8220;wealth&#8221; we happily invested our dollars in enterprises which brought Asian and Chicano labor into this country.  There is much truth in the Mexican assertion that they do work we are unwilling to do ourselves.  </p>
<p>Actually, you and others like you are the race traitors.  You want to preserve your ill-gotten financial gains and the easy-money lifestyle provided by cheap foreign labor.  What bothers you is having the foreign labor next door, marrying your children, and competing with you for high-end jobs.  This sort of cognitive dissonance is the Achilles&rsquo; Heel of implicit white &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; conservatism and explicit racial nationalism.  It is why most (white) people inwardly agree that conservatives and nationalists are supremacist rather than separatist partisans favoring free association.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t have our cake and eat it. The solution to the race problem is to recognize our complicity, financially divest ourselves of the present system, and create a system of our own.  The first requires honest self-appraisal.  The second requires enterprise and sacrifice.  The third requires courage.  </p>
<p>It is not easy to plead guilty to moral turpitude.  We must do it, however, or face the unpleasant alternative.</p>

		<p>Is there anybody on the forum who has served actively in any of the branches and has information as to the current situation with foreigners in the military? </p>
<p>I have been in Iraq, Afghan and Kuwait over the 5 years ending this past Dec 08 (due to return in June 09)I have encountered many, many foreigners in the military, especially the ARMY. Jamaicans, Haitians, Tobago, Dominican, Puertos, Hondos, Salvs, Mexicans. In fact, I saw an entire platoon in Southern Iraq consisting entirely of non English speaking troops, with Hispanic heritage (Spanish speaking) NCOs and a White officer (don&rsquo;t know if he spoke Spanish) Ugandans have the security posts in many American bases in Iraq, in Baghdad, at LZ Washington the Salvadorans are security. The troops I witnessed in the ARMY platoon were U.S. MILITARY, so don&rsquo;t start with the &#8220;auxilliary&#8221; troop thing, I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!</p>

		<p>This is starting to remind me a lot of ancient Rome with its policy of recruiting barbarians (largely Germanic)</p>
<p>This would be true of the EASTERN EMPIRE, the WESTERN empire recruited middle easterners, SW Asians (Iranians, Iraqis, Leban etc.) Neither ended well for the Roman empires.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;I thoroughly despise the US military. And no&hellip;I do not support the troops- especially the non-white ones&#8221;</p>
<p>I was first a police officer and then a district attorney&rsquo;s investigator in San Francisco.  You cannot believe how many black military men and their dependents from the Navy Base treasure Island and the Presidio Army Base committed crimes in the city.</p>
<p>I well remember a black 22 year old college student.  She was the daughter of a black Colonel stationed at the Presidio.  She  viciusly assaulted a sales woman who caught her shoplifting in the I Magnin department store.</p>
