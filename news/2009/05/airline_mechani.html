<h1>Airline Mechanics Who Can&rsquo;t Read English</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Byron Harris, WFAA-TV (News 8, Dallas-Ft. Worth), May 16, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>News 8 has recently revealed serious flaws in the way the FAA licenses mechanics who fix planes.</p>
<p>There is evidence of years of problems in testing these mechanics. There is also evidence that hundreds of mechanics with questionable licenses are working on aircraft in Texas.</p>
<p>Now there is evidence of repair facilities hiring low-wage mechanics who can&rsquo;t read English.</p>
<p>Twenty-one people were killed when U.S. Airways Express Flight 5481 crashed in Charlotte, North Carolina in 2003. The plane went wildly out of control on takeoff.</p>
<p>One reason for the crash, investigators found, was that mechanics incorrectly connected the cables to some of the plane&rsquo;s control surfaces in the repair shop. The FAA was cited for improper oversight of the repair process.</p>
<p>Repairing airplanes is a complicated business. Airplanes have many manuals. Typically, when mechanics repair a part, they open the manual, consult the book, and make the repair step-by-step, as if it were a recipe book.</p>
<p>They make a list of every action they take, so the next person to fix the plane (as well as the people who fly it) will know exactly what has been done.</p>
<p>If mechanics don&rsquo;t speak English, the international language of aviation, they can&rsquo;t read the manual and they can&rsquo;t record their activities.</p>
<p>There are more than 236 FAA-certified aircraft repair stations in Texas, according to the FAA&rsquo;s Web site. News 8 has learned that hundreds of the mechanics working in those shops do not speak English and are unable to read repair manuals for today&rsquo;s sophisticated aircraft.</p>
<p>Former FAA inspector Bill McNease told News 8 he regularly encountered applicants for pilots&rsquo; licenses who tried to pretend they could speak English  &mdash;  but could not.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was based in Dallas, I had that happen every week,&#8221; McNease said. &#8220;It was not uncommon at all to have foreign flight students. We had mechanics, but I handled the pilot end of it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I turned down people every week because they couldn&rsquo;t speak English.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are people [where I work] who do not know how to read a maintenance manual as they are spelled out, because they don&rsquo;t have a clue,&#8221; said one certified aircraft mechanic who works at a Texas aircraft repair station. He wished to remain anonymous to protect his employment.</p>
<p>To certify a part for flight or repair an engine, a mechanic must be licensed by the FAA as an Airframe and Powerplant mechanic, known in the business as an &#8220;A&P.;&#8221;</p>
<p>News 8 discovered that mechanics at one licensing center in San Antonio were being tested in Spanish as late as last fall. The FAA ultimately shut the facility down.</p>
<p>Supervisors in Texas repair stations say they are supposed to oversee the repairs of dozens of untrained mechanics who can&rsquo;t read the manuals and can&rsquo;t write down the work they&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>But the FAA does not require every person working at a repair station to be a certified A&P.; One certified A&P; can sign off on the work of dozens of uncertified mechanics.</p>
<p>That creates a huge problem, another certified mechanic told News 8. &#8220;I need an interpreter to talk to these people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They can&rsquo;t read the manuals, they can&rsquo;t write, and I have so many working for me I can&rsquo;t be sure of the work they&rsquo;ve done.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be sure of proper quality, the supervisor has to either re-do the work himself or take the chance that no mistakes have been made. There is a push to get work out the door and planes back in the air. But when he signs his name to certify the repair for flight, he is legally responsible for it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The FAA is supposed to police repair stations, but insiders say the agency is more focused on looking at paperwork than inspecting the facilities. Insiders also say inspectors warn repair stations when they&rsquo;re coming.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Texas&rsquo; two biggest airlines, American and Southwest, both require mechanics and the technicians who work under them to speak, read and write English.</p>
<p>But mechanics who work elsewhere  &mdash;  whose repairs often end up on commercial airliners  &mdash;  say their shops are filled with non-English speakers.</p>
<p>The FAA declined to be interviewed for this report.<br>

			<p>&#8220;There is evidence of years of problems in testing these mechanics. There is also evidence that hundreds of mechanics with questionable licenses are working on aircraft in Texas.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can just imagine watching the PC talking heads on TV trying to make it sound like all these inadequacies are pluses.  </p>
<p>They would be doing the same if they wanted non-white, blind pilots to fly planes.</p>
<p>Every profession in this country has lower standards than what used to be accepted as the norm.  It&rsquo;s just one more indication of our degeneration toward third world status.</p>
<p>Remember the article on the black pilot trainees in South Africa?  One black came in for a landing without first lowering his wheels.  Another had problems and pushed his ejector button without popping the canopy first and would up plastered to the ceiling.</p>
<p>And the reason the big, black honcho gave for their dismal showings?  What else, but white racism.</p>
<p>This is just another avenue of deterioration in another profession.  </p>
<p>The people really responsible for all this are the whites who hire these pitiful rejects so they can earn larger bonuses.</p>

<p>What a viciously racist article!</p>
<p>My God in Heaven, to make the obnoxiously absurd claim that English is, &ldquo;the international language of aviation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When will we ever learn, that no price is too high to be paid when obtaining diversity&rsquo;s strengths; or that multilingual and multiracial approaches to technical problems of any kind are far better, since they offer a uniquely innovative trajectory in working out those challenges?</p>
<p>After all, we aren&rsquo;t in the Dark Ages anymore!<br>

<p><br>
 Hmmmm&hellip; pretended to speak English. Imagine how stupid one must be to go to another country and try to bluff his/her way through an interview in a language they do not know. What are they thinking?! And who hires these people, who don&rsquo;t speak English, to work on something as intricate as aircraft? Not much room for error on aircraft&hellip; or so I thought! What&rsquo;s the real problem here? Is business so focused on profit that good sense goes out the window? Is our government so inept as to let this happen? Or, are we so twisted and turned inside-out by &#8220;equality&#8221; that we recognize English illiterate (possibly completely illiterate) vagrants as equals to trained/experienced technicians? Hard to believe our country has come to this!</p>

			<p>The article hints at, but doesn&rsquo;t really go into detail about &#8216;English being the international language of aviation&rsquo;</p>
<p>Any pilot, anywhere in the world, be it Russia, Germany or India is required by International Civil Aviation Organization standards to be &#8216;English Proficient&rsquo;. They even stamp &#8216;English Proficient&rsquo; on the back of our pilot&rsquo;s licenses.</p>
<p>Since they don&rsquo;t mention the ICAO standards, the article makes it easy for some bleeding heart to assume its purely racism that is behind these applicants being turned down.</p>

			<p>I find this story a little hard to swallow.  To become a certified A&E; (airframe and powerplant) technician requires passage of some pretty stringent FAA exams, which are administered in English.  It&rsquo;s certainly possible that some sorts of ground handlers and perhaps shop personnel are not altogether fluent in English, but the guys turning wrenches and signing off on repairs and maintenance procedures are certified techs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got somewhere between 4500-5000 hours in many types of aircraft and don&rsquo;t remember ever encountering an A&E; who wasn&rsquo;t thoroughly conversant in English.  </p>

			<p>In view of the fact that there are millions of air travelers who place their safety and lives in the hands of those who repair the aircraft they fly on, this should be a front page scandal across the country, but it looks like it will be just another issue swept under the rug for politically correct reasons&hellip;..that is not to hurt the feelings of Spanish speakers or provoke the ire of their whining advocacy organizations.</p>
<p>The question comes too mind: if these &#8220;mechanics&#8221; won&rsquo;t make the effort to learn to speak, read, and write English, how can anybody know for certain just how dedicated or able to do their jobs correctly they are? It would appear these people just do the minimum to get in the door at these slipshod repair facilities. What an absurd situation that a supervisor needs a translator to speak to his own staff who work in a field where human lives can be put at risk. </p>
<p>What about all those car dealerships that are closing? I would venture there are a lot of excellent English proficient mechanics who know how to fix modern complicated cars that would probably be more concerned with following proper repair procedures on paper than those doing the job now with such a low educational level. </p>
<p>This appears to be one of those situations where one or more aircraft will end up crashing some day, killing all aboard, then the cause being traced to some ignorant foreign mechanic that made a critical mistake because he couldn&rsquo;t comprehend English repair instructions. Only then might Congress hold hearings on the matter to correct such a ridicilous situation. </p>

			<p>Who cares, anyway?  Nobody in their right mind wants to fly today.  Wait in line for hours and watch geriatric white women in wheelchairs searched, while Arabs board untroubled?  No thanks.</p>
<p>If airplanes start falling out of the sky, I only hope they have the right people on them as the passengers.</p>

			<p>To John PM,The U.S.Air flight that crashed in Charlotte N.C.killing 21 was piloted by a female captain,are standards lowered for females,as well as other minorities,you bet they are,the Value Jet crash into the everglades in 1996,killing 110,featured a female pilot also,I was once on a flight from a northeastern city to Florida when a female captain had to be told by a passenger to have the aircraft de-iced after a long delay on the ground in an ice storm!</p>

			<p> Im going to agree with john. Im not going to believe that people being allowed to turn wrenches on a $100 million dollar aircraft that has a thick insurance policy and hundreds of lives in the balance are anything but fully qualified and rigorously tested. Theres just too much downside.</p>
<p>  Sure I can see illegals turning wrenches in various car dealerships and repair shops but Delta airlines trying to save a few bucks on personnel by letting &#8220;rio grande pepe&#8221; do the service on the Pratt &amp; Whitney simply isnt credible. Can you imagine an engine falling off over the atlantic and the FAA checking out the maintenance hangar and finding the guy in charge of the engine bolts used to work slinging tacos in Guadalajara?</p>
<p>  Nope, bogus. The end of the airline is the downside here. </p>

<p>NOT LIKELY! no one with their career in mind will accuse one of the protected species..It is always better to blame everything on the pilots, assuming they do not survive. If the pilots do survive, it makes cover ups all the more difficult finding whom to blame.</p>

			<p>I was at my local Sears when a half dozen non-Whites and women came into the tool section, lists in hand, buying rollaways and all the stuff to fill them.  I asked one guy what the story was and they were all in some government training program, free tuition, free tools, because there was a shortage of aircraft mechanics.  I didn&rsquo;t ask if it was open to White men, but I wonder that Whites aren&rsquo;t doing everything to enter so highly skilled a trade.  </p>

			<p>This is just another example of how diversity is good for the economy.  You see, when an airplane crashes, paramedics, police, investigators and forensic scientists all must work at the scene.  Then there are many business opportunities for funeral directors, clergy, politicians, prosecutors and counselors.  All told, thousands of jobs are generated, or enhanced, when an airplane goes down.  Also, let&rsquo;s not forget that for each airplane that crashes, another one must be built.  The benefits to the economy are great and they ripple through it on every level - from the highest paid technicians all the way down to the grave diggers.  When an airplane happens to crash into an occupied building such as a school or hospital, then the economy really hits the jackpot!  This is because the additional deaths bring even more jobs and rebuilding the destroyed buildings causes employment to untold thousands.  So let&rsquo;s all applaud diversity!!</p>

			<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;When will we ever learn, that no price is too high to be paid when obtaining diversity&rsquo;s strengths; or that multilingual and multiracial approaches to technical problems of any kind</p>
<p>And what, if I may ask, is the author of this nonsense smoking or ingesting? Why on earth would we gain strength from diversity? The idea is ludicrous; given the manifold negative benefits multi-cultural diversity bestows on a formerly homogeneous nation.</p>
<p>For the record, Mr. JohnPM, you might care to do a bit of researching basic history. The Industrial Revolution did not start in Bangladesh, in an obscure Indian, Chinese, Koreanese or Japanese village; much less the African jungles&hellip; The Industrial Revolution was really started in England with the development of the steam engine. Progressing to Europe and North America. </p>
<p>The third-world (non-White nations) have our European and their American ancestors to thank for all the benefits civilization has brought to them. If there were even a grain of real truth to the claim of racial equality, it would have been only reasonable that the various races were virtually equal in development, technology and knowledge. Differences being measurable in years rather than in centuries or millenia.</p>
<p>If you chose to feign offense at this historic and inarguable reality with shouts of &#8220;racism&#8221;, that is YOUR problem, certainly not mine.</p>

			<p>That idiotic charge of &#8220;racism&#8221; by an above poster trumpeting the &#8220;blessings&#8221; of diversity and multi-culturalism inspired me to post this little tidbit received from a friend. What makes it particularly relevant&hellip; that the politically inadmissible message came out of the Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the L. A. Times <br>
1. 40% of all workers in L. A. County (L. A. County has 10.2 million people)are working for cash and not paying taxes. This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants working without a green card.</p>
<p>2. 95% of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens. </p>
<p>3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens. </p>
<p>4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers. </p>
<p>5. Nearly 35% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals here illegally </p>
<p>6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages. </p>
<p>7. The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border. </p>
<p>8. Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal. </p>
<p>9. 21 radio stations in L. A. Are Spanish speaking. \</p>
<p>10. In L. A. County 5.1 million people speak English, 3..9 million speak Spanish. (There are 10.2 million people in L. A. County. )</p>
<p>(All 10 of the above facts are from the Los Angeles Times)<br>
 <br>
Less than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops, but 29% are on welfare. Over 70% of the United States&rsquo; annual population growth (and over 90% of California, Florida, and New York) results from immigration.  29% of inmates in federal prisons are illegal aliens.<br>
 <br>
Kind of makes one wonder just what benefits, if any, we, the American people are supposed to enjoy from &#8220;diversity&#8221; as our esteemed JohnPM puts it. I, for one, would welcome his further explanation.</p>
<p>For the record, our state (Texas) is also &#8220;blessed&#8221; with a huge amount of multicultural diversity. Yes, because of it, crime is quite high in our state also.<br>

			<p>My wife and I enjoy travelling, too, Kill Your TV.  It turns out our cars run just fine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re planning a road trip along parts of the old Route 66 this summer in my wife&rsquo;s car, a 1931 Model A Ford (with the engine and tranny out of my old Mazda RX-7).  It seems somehow appropriate to take that car instead of my Saturn.</p>
<p>And yes, an air crash with nothing but corporate big-shots and congresscritters aboard would be ideal, provided the flight crew survives.</p>

			<p>I can appreciate that many pilots who have flown in the past have not seen non-English speaking mechanics - so far.  But the witness of other posts here seem to point to a situation soon to become the reality.</p>
<p>I can just recall the semi-scandal airing on the MSM last week about the pilots who crashed that jet into a home with their salaries and training shortfalls.</p>
<p>It is still safer to fly than drive, but for how long?</p>

			<p>&#8220;This is just another example of how diversity is good for the economy. You see, when an airplane crashes, paramedics, police, investigators and forensic scientists all must work at the scene. Then there are many business opportunities for funeral directors, clergy, politicians, prosecutors and counselors. All told, thousands of jobs are generated, or enhanced, when an airplane goes down. Also, let&rsquo;s not forget that for each airplane that crashes, another one must be built. The benefits to the economy are great and they ripple through it on every level - from the highest paid technicians all the way down to the grave diggers. When an airplane happens to crash into an occupied building such as a school or hospital, then the economy really hits the jackpot! This is because the additional deaths bring even more jobs and rebuilding the destroyed buildings causes employment to untold thousands. So let&rsquo;s all applaud diversity!!&#8221;</p>

<p>I appreciate the sarcasm and point you make here.  The problem of course is that insurance has to pay for all these losses and that would bankrupt them.  That bankruptcy would cause the economy to collapse world wide.  That is like AIG  and every other insurance conglomerate failing simultaneously.  That is the reason - the sole reason when you get to the central issue - why the loss leader economic model that personal injury attorneys, malpractice and all the rest of the long train of economic vampires that follow it that are represented in this actually force the intelligent actors in society to try to avoid it at all costs.  As intelligence leaves the leaderships, the probability of your scenario - and mine - increases.</p>

			<p>Well, many of us have to fly for business and many enjoy traveling. To say that no one cares because YOU don&rsquo;t have to fly makes you sound like an idiot.</p>
<p>Are you sure about who is the idiot? Why, with computer technology programs available for interactive meetings would anyone spend the money to fly? Why is traveling on a plane the best way to go? You can&rsquo;t see anything. I&rsquo;m really not sure who the idiot is here.</p>

			<p>&#8220;There is also evidence that hundreds of mechanics with questionable licenses are working on aircraft in Texas.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am sure that the female minority immigrant physicians who mis diagnosed my fractured trochanter as &#8220;sciatica caused by pinched nerves&#8221; while refusing to x ray my hip have questionable licenses.</p>
<p>I was not on any county govt health system.  I had Cigna PPO, an excellent insurance policy.  Finally, after 4 years of hobbling around I diagnosed myself, found some WHITE MALE AMERICAN PHYSICIANS and discovered that due to a never xrayed trochanter fracture my trochanter had basically dissolved.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting a hip replacement soon, with a WHITE MALE AMERICAN ORTHO SURGEON, but who knows who will be doing the anesthesia or otherwise assisting.</p>
<p>I went to the diagnostic &#8220;cookbooks&#8221; as they are called and found that these female minority immigrants had failed to follow a few basic diagnostic procedures, such as &#8220;X-RAYS REQUIRED&#8221;</p>
<p>It is getting harder and harder to find White American male physicians under the age of 60 in California.  It is all non Whites from the most corrupt Asian countries in the world where people think absolutely nothing of buying a medical school transcropt and hiring someone to take the board exams.<br>

			<p>With all due respect to Fed Up and Anonymous at 10:51 PM on May 19,</p>
<p>My point was to be sarcastic and ironic, in the comments that I made above yesterday at 6:43 PM. Please reread my comments, with that in mind; they were not intended to be serious in their &ldquo;celebration&rdquo; of diversity or its &ldquo;strengths.&rdquo; I apologize for any confusion on that point, sincerely. </p>
<p>I am convinced that racial &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; has been anything but a &ldquo;strength&rdquo; for this country; on the other hand, I am unshakably confident that it is a childish perversity that amuses a small Red elite in the USA and no other group in question, including most nonwhites who &ldquo;enjoy&rdquo; it beyond the usual Marxist abstractions. </p>
<p>All the best to you both,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Sure I can see illegals turning wrenches in various car dealerships and repair shops but Delta airlines trying to save a few bucks on personnel by letting &ldquo;rio grande pepe&rdquo; do the service on the Pratt &amp; Whitney simply isnt credible. Can you imagine an engine falling off over the atlantic and the FAA checking out the maintenance hangar and finding the guy in charge of the engine bolts used to work slinging tacos in Guadalajara?&#8221;</p>
<p>Like every other employer in America, they are under the EEOC and Judicial orders to hire only non Whites.  That could very well be the reason why there are so many non English literate mechanics.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The U.S.Air flight that crashed in Charlotte N.C.killing 21 was piloted by a female captain,are standards lowered for females,as well as other minorities,you bet they are,the Value Jet crash into the everglades in 1996,killing 110,featured a female pilot also&#8221;</p>
<p>Standards are not lowered for white females. The Value Jet crash wasn&rsquo;t caused by pilot error but by an explosion of oxygen tanks in the cargo hold. Plenty of crashes have happened with male pilots. Some of smaller plane companies hire inexperienced pilots to save money.</p>

			<p>This was sent to me, laughed a lot over it.<br>
 After every flight, Qantas pilots fill out a form, called a &#8220;gripe<br>
  sheet,&#8221; which tells mechanics about problems with the aircraft. The<br>
  mechanics correct the problems, document their repairs on the form,<br>
  them the pilots review the gripe sheets right before the next<br>
  flight. Never let it be said that ground crews lack a sense of humor.</p>
<p>  Here are some of the actual maintenance complaints submitted by the<br>
  Qantas pilots (as marked with a P) and the solutions recorded (as<br>
  marked with an S) by the maintenance engineers.</p>
<p>  <br>
  P: Left inside main tire almost needs replacement.</p>
<p>  S: Almost replaced left inside main tire.</p>
<p><br>
  P: Test flight OK, except auto-land very rough.</p>
<p>  S: Auto-land not installed on this aircraft.</p>
<p><br>
  P: Something loose in the cockpit.</p>
<p>  S: Something tightened in the cockpit.</p>
<p><br>
  P: Dead bugs on windshield.</p>
<p>  S: Live bugs on backorder.</p>
<p><br>
  P: Autopilot in altitude-hold mode produces a 200 feet per minute<br>
  descent.</p>
<p>  S: Cannot reproduce problem on ground.</p>
<p><br>
  P: Evidence of a leak on the right main landing gear.</p>
<p>  S: Evidence removed.</p>
<p><br>
  P: DME volume unbelievably loud.</p>
<p>  S: DME volume reset to a more believable level.</p>
<p><br>
  P: Friction locks cause throttle levers to stick.</p>
<p>  S: That&rsquo;s what friction locks are for.</p>
<p><br>
  P: IFF inoperative in OFF mode.</p>
<p>  S: IFF always inoperative in OFF mode.</p>
<p><br>
  P: Suspected crack in windshield.</p>
<p>  S: Suspect you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p><br>
  P: The number 3 engine is missing.</p>
<p>  S: Engine found on right wing after a brief search.</p>
<p><br>
  P: Aircraft handles funny.</p>
<p>  S: Aircraft warned to straighten up, fly right and be serious.</p>
<p><br>
  P: Target radar hums.</p>
<p>  S: Reprogrammed target radar with lyrics.</p>
<p><br>
  P: Mouse in cockpit.<br>
  S: Cat installed                                           <br>
     And the best one saved for last&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>  P: Noise coming from under the instrument panel. Sounds like a<br>
  midget pounding on something with a hammer.<br>
  S: Took hammer away from the midget.<br>

			<p>&#8220;4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Medi-cal pays the hospitals just $1,000 while American parents or their insurance companies pay $12,000 to $14,000 for a birth </p>
<p>6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages.  8. Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal.</p>
<p>And 100 percent of the homeless are White blue eyed anglo saxon/scotch irish or black Americans whose ancestors arrived in this country 400 years ago and built this country.</p>
<p>My city, Santa Monica Ca. is full of homeless, about half black, half White.  Santa Monica has no housing projects, but plenty of section 8 housing.  Virtually all the section 8 housing is occupied by illegal aliens who work in the city&rsquo;s thriving tourism, hotel and restaurant industries.</p>
<p>My landlord has just moved himself and his 2 boys into a very small 1 bedroom apt.  His great grandparents arrived in Santa Monica in the 1880&rsquo;s and built their house on the property.  Successive generations inherited.  When the property taxes got too much,and affirmative action hit hard,  my landlord&rsquo;s parents tore down the house and built the apartment building, thinking that their son and grandchildren would be ok for both income and a place to live.</p>
<p>He lost his job.  He now works as a waiter 3 nights a week. The rents just about cover the taxes, utilities and maintance on the building.  He only has the waiter job because an old friend from high school owns the restaurant.  He is the only American employed in the restaurant.  His sons are in middle school, but will soon move on to the hispanic gang infested public high school.  </p>
<p>Sometimes tourists ask me directions in downtown Santa Monica.  Then they start on about all the very visible homeless, many of whom are in the 60 to 80 year old range hobbling along with their canes and wheel chairs.  Generally the tourists start on about &#8220;why doesn&rsquo;t America have a social safety net&#8221;  </p>
<p>So I explain that everyone of the indian illegal aliens working in the hotels and restaurants lives in local Santa Monica government housing while the American homeless are not eligible to live in for government housing because they are Americans.<br>

			<p>Until we get a couple of MAJOR, MAJOR aircraft crashes, the federal government will continue to turn a blind eye to incompetent mechanics working on airliners. But predictably, the feds will use the excuse of claiming the incompetent mechanics were hired as part of an affirmative action effort. Thus the government (and airline maintenance departments) to be held blames&hellip; for trying to do the right thing.</p>

			<p>&#8216;&hellip;.The Industrial Revolution was really started in England with the development of the steam engine&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fed Up:</p>
<p>Please, give credit where credit is due.  The steam engine was developed in Scotland by the brilliant mechanical engineer James Watt:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;James Watt (19 January 1736 – 25 August 1819[1]) was a Scottish inventor and mechanical engineer whose improvements to the steam engine were fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Watt improved an old inefficient Newcomen steam engine that required massive amounts of coal to work:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Newcomen engine just barely worked, and after much experimentation Watt showed that about 80% of the heat of the steam was consumed in heating the cylinder&hellip; His critical insight was to cause the steam to condense in a separate chamber apart from the piston, and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam. He soon had a working model by 1765&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seriously, your apology is more than accepted; my intent was to mock being as &ldquo;tolerantly&rdquo; Communistic and stupid as possible and I apparently succeeded.

<p>Thanks for the support and compliments regarding that above post. The one dead giveaway as to my intent, should have been the fact that I used words and grammar that surpassed the average kindergartner. Most of the Multi Cult trolls have a hard time meeting that standard; however, once in awhile, you do get a Marxist prodigy spewing their &ldquo;thoughts&rdquo; here (i.e., they seem to have hit the fourth grade between the ages of 15 and 18 at some point.) </p>
