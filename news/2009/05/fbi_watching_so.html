<h1><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=98997">FBI Watching Somali Muslims in D.C.</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Sperry, WorldNetDaily, May 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fearing the next terror attack could emerge from America&rsquo;s growing Somali refugee population, federal authorities have stepped up surveillance in Somali communities  &mdash;  including a large enclave just outside Washington.</p>
<p>In fact, WND has learned that the Baileys Crossroads area of Northern Virginia  &mdash;  about 10 miles from the capital  &mdash;  was a critical focus of security investigations in advance of the presidential inauguration in January.</p>
<p>Investigators say a troubling number of the area&rsquo;s Somali men hold &#8220;militant&#8221; anti-American views and sympathize with al-Qaida. They typically work as taxi drivers, gathering at local coffeehouses during their breaks, as well as at a nearby mosque tied to 9/11.</p>
<p>Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Va., which assisted at least two of the al-Qaida hijackers, has a large representation of Somali immigrants. Investigators say a former Dar al-Hijrah imam is now working with al-Qaida to arm and recruit fighters  &mdash;  including Americans  &mdash;  for the holy war in Somalia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Authorities estimate the Washington area is home to about 6,000 Somalis, most of whom are Muslim.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most Somali immigrants are refugees of civil unrest in the war-torn African country of Somalia. However, investigators say many recent immigrants have used false narratives to enter the U.S. They say some 80 percent of Somalis who came into the U.S. on the basis of family reunification are in fact not related.</p>
<p>The Dar al-Hijrah cleric who privately ministered to two of the 9/11 hijackers  &mdash;  possibly preparing them for their suicide mission targeting the Pentagon  &mdash;  has been actively recruiting Americans to join the holy war in Somalia.</p>

			<p>Much simpler solution:  Not allowing the Somalians to &#8220;migrate&#8221; to begin with.  20 years from now:  Somali FBI agents.</p>

			<p>Such clever people you Americans!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious what will happen with all the 3rd worlders being invited in with open arms and yet you keep them rolling in.  <br>
Its quite simple stop 3rd world immigration or you will live to regret your actions.</p>

			<p>     Meanwhile we invite more of them to live among us and our government welcomes them with open arms. I wonder how many of them are fifth-columnists who are sizing us up for an even greater Pearl Harbor. Their religious beliefs are incompatible with the concepts of freedom and self-determination. We will pay a heavy price later on for allowing them to live among us.</p>

<p>What did our government think was going to happen when it let in muslims? Sometimes, the stupidity of the government boggles the mind. All this could have been avoided if they hadn&rsquo;t let muslims in in the first place.</p>

			<p>unfortunately, the only people that will face any REAL scrutiny will be any white person who remotely questions why dangerous muslims are living here and no one is doing anything about it!   </p>

			<p>&#8220;Militants may be planning terrorist attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but I love it.  Here&rsquo;s hoping any attack they undertake will include the disgusting do-gooders responsible for bringing them over here.</p>

			<p>Somalis are trouble wherever they go, and the government knows it.</p>
<p>There are vested interests who want more Somalis. They stimulate work for the courts of justice, for developers (when neighborhoods are ruined), for those involved in taking taxpayer money to &#8216;solve&rsquo; the social ills of Somalis, and for those involved in &#8216;diversity management&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Elites benefit from the chaos Somalis inevitably bring. </p>

			<p>I would love to see a report on what the cost to taxpayers for this diversity opportunity.  In the UK the last estimate I heard was about 1 million pounds for each one over their lives in the UK.</p>

			<p>Yeah, I used to live in that neighborhood at Bailey&rsquo;s Crossroads.  I knew all this stuff was going on because I would hear the muslims talk/scream anti american rantings. I tried to tell my white friends about it and was called a racist biggot.  </p>

			<p>Its not a question of IF,but WHEN these people carry out a major <br>
terrorist attack on US soil.They are quite simply the most violent people on the planet,which when combined with a fanatical<br>
adherence to Islam creates just about the biggest threat to <br>
inland security since Pearl Harbor.There are around 400.000 Somalis resident in my own country(UK),courtesy of Blair/Brown<br>
and they are despised and feared even by other blacks.The US <br>
should immediately halt all further immigration from NE Africa,but is that going to happen?,we all know the answer to that one. </p>

			<p>&#8220;20 years from now: Somali FBI agents.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it gets more egregious than that: Because of Affirmative Action, the USA is already hiring Somali immigrants as Immigration Agents assigned to African immigration (because of their &#8220;special knowledge&#8221; of and &#8220;sensitivity&#8221; to that region &amp; those cultures).  The end result will be even greater Third World immigration, as corruption, incompetence, and kinship-favoritism takes hold.  </p>
<p>The same thing already happened along our southern border.  Because it was &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;hateful&#8221; that few Mexican immigrants were serving as Border Patrolmen, the USA government implemented Affirmative Action hiring for more Hispanic Immigration and Border Patrol agents.  We hired hundreds of Mexican-Americans, who had family and friends on the other side of the border, in Mexico.  Then we wonder why there is now massive corruption in those agencies, and why legal and illegal immigration, drug and prostitution smuggling have all increased.  It is common knowledge that in many border towns, Border Patrol agents of Mexican-American heritage are buying expensive new home, cars, and vacations, in cash!! How could they afford those on their low salaries?  Of course most ICE and Drug Enforcement personnel are honest, but it is insane to place the fox in charge of the hen-house. </p>

<p>How much are the drug cartels paying former soldiers?? Consider&hellip; the Border Patrol offered me a job, then said I had to be Bi-Lingual??? I AM multi lingual but NOT SPANISH. THEN!!! they only offered $50,000 annual salary.  No wonder the cartels are able to buy officers so easily, a year&rsquo;s salary for allowing an old pick-up with an old lady driving into the U.S. sounds like a pretty good deal to them.</p>

			<p>most people fail to realize that the 9-11 hijackers did not act alone. cells were set up here in america in the years leading up to the attack. how bad is it here in america? if you have a mosque in your city you already have at least one terror cell located there. the muslims are also using mexican illegals and also chinese immigrants to aid their efforts here. the fbi, as well as most other federal agencies are now rife with informers within the ranks giving aid and comfort to the enemy. one of the reasons the cartels in mexico remain one step ahead of the federales is the infiltration of border patrol and ins. mexicans working at these agencies are their best sources for information. look to see attacks to start once hostilities kick off with the koreans and chinese. american military will soon be shocked as china joins in to aid their north korean allies. my advice is for americans to begin arming themselves and preparing for possible large scale attacks here within the united states. federal government will become paralyzed and unable to act as they showed in new orleans. start by forming suvival groups within your local area. start with those smart enough to recognize the threat and who have useful skills for survival. make sure they do know weapons safety and how to perform basic first aid and contruction skills. work out evacuation routes in case they are needed. remember that major roads will all face gridlock within minutes. cities that have major immigrant or black populations should be avoided as these will be first areas to face meltdown. efforts should be made to disguise female members of your teams as they will be subject to kidnap and rape, torture, murder. take in no one who fails to see what may happen. when this kicks off the first to die will be the pollyanna, can&rsquo;t we all get along types. they are more trouble than they are loose. do not make the mistake of including such in your groups. also avoid anyone who voted for a democrat as these peope remain susceptible to brainwash. above all things, turn off the television. obama is lying to keep you calm. millions could die before this is over. get ready now. those who are not prepared will be sorry they did not.</p>

			<p>This works two fold for the government.  Number one, they can invite in more non-whites to push out its white citizens, and number two it gives them an excuse to push us even farther into a police state.  </p>
