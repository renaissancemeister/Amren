			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>politics.co.uk, May 4, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new bus advert featuring American civil rights figurehead Rosa Parks will be launched today to encourage black women to vote in the upcoming local and European elections.</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s rights group the Fawcett Society, which commissioned the adverts, has conducted researching finding ethnic-minority women  &mdash;  particularly black women  &mdash;  are less likely to be registered to vote than white women and ethnic-minority men.</p>
<p>They are also less engaged in mainstream politics: there are only two black women MPs, while there has never been an Asian woman MP.</p>
<p>Today, five black women will be riding a London bus to launch the campaign and promote &#8216;Your Voice&rsquo;, Fawcett&rsquo;s new guide to democracy for ethnic-minority women ahead of local and European elections on 4 June.</p>
<p>On 1 December 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white man on a racially segregated bus in Alabama, triggering the civil rights movement. She was promptly arrested for her decision.</p>
<p>Joella Hazel, outreach officer at the Fawcett Society said: &#8220;Rosa Parks took a huge risk on that bus. She sat down so that we could stand up, so that black women around the world could have the right to vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet today in the UK, black women are amongst the least likely to be registered to vote, meaning our voices are not being heard by politicians. I&rsquo;m taking this bus with Rosa to show how a person&rsquo;s actions can make a difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>The European elections, as well as elections for some English local authorities, will take place on Thursday, June 4th.</p>

			<p>What Miss Hazel conveniently forgets to add about Rosa Parks is that she was a long time civil rights operative, who had planned for a long time with her cohorts to do this.  That her actions on the bus were not spontaneous and pre-planned are now admitted to by leftist civil rights advocates, in more ways than one.  One Claudette Colvin was supposed to be the Rosa Parks, but the civil rights movement took her down from the flagpole, as her personal morals were not the best, and for propaganda and PR purposes, the civil rights movement wanted front figures that were cleaner and purer than Ceasar&rsquo;s wife.  At least at first.</p>

<p>She can start out by not insulting or assaulting anyone, or even killing someone. That a difference we can believe in. </p>

			<p>Rosa Parks was a media created fraud. As for black women in the U.K. in 1955 there would have been extremely few of them. Funny how revisionism works. </p>

I&rsquo;m shocked! Doesn&rsquo;t the UK have a single black female civil rights heroine? Get Trevor Philips on the phone NOW!</p>
<p>If not, they need to manufacture one immediately!</p>

			<p>A few questions: Is there some reason why black women have not registered to vote? Why are they &#8216;the least likely&rsquo; to register? Could the fact that they can&rsquo;t be bothered to register be connected to the fact that their voices are &#8216;not heard&rsquo; by politicians? </p>
<p>And -  last question - how is this anyone&rsquo;s fault but their own?</p>

			<p>Registering to vote in the U.K. is automatic and - in theory - compulsory; a form arrives in the mailbox and is then filled out by the people in the house or apartment.</p>
<p>This is how grotesque absurdities occur, like fictitious people being on the electoral register and subsequently voting in local elections. This happened recently in the U.K.; Conservative Party [!] Muslims won a ward. Subsequently some were jailed.</p>
<p>Normally, it is NOT the Conservatives who are guilty of these sorts of offenses.</p>

			<p>What a laugh. The Marxist labour party  is really worried about the BNP. Like all socialists they will do anything, grasp at the very last hopes of retaining power.  Too late I think.<br/>
The masses have seen thru their veneer.</p>
<p>Bye bye Gordon!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Where you are in the UK, they DO have the right to vote&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet today in the UK, black women are amongst the least likely to be registered to vote,</p>
<p>So you couldn&rsquo;t be bothered? What&rsquo;s stopping you from registering?</p>
<p>&#8220;meaning our voices are not being heard by politicians.&#8221;</p>
<p>As above- whose fault is that then&hellip;</p>
<p>They are also less engaged in mainstream politics: there are only two black women MPs, while there has never been an Asian woman MP.</p>
<p>Well, they are minority groups aren&rsquo;t they?</p>

			<p>The Fawcett Society is a British feminist organization that gets its money from the Partnership Grant Program (the British Government). So you Brits are financing your own destruction. It&rsquo;s the same in the USA.</p>
