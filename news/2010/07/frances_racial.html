<h1><a href="http://www.arthurkemp.com/?p=526">France&rsquo;s Racial Birth Statistics: It&rsquo;s Worse Than Reported</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Arthur Kemp, Arthur Kemp&rsquo;s Blog, June 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some internet sites have reported that the number of babies born to blacks in Paris, France, is now 54%, according to the medical reports of the incidence of drepanocytosis in that country.</p>
<p>These reports are slightly distorted, for a number of reasons, but most importantly are actually an understatement of the true situation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>First of all, it is correct that the incidence of drepanocytosis, or sickle cell, can be taken as a guide to the presence of sub-Saharan African presence.</p>
<p>However, the statistics clearly show that it is only a minority of Africans who have this inherited disease. In other words, if 54% of births in Paris show up with sickle cell, then the actual number of black births in Paris is actually far higher.</p>
<p>Actually, anyone who has been to Paris recently will know this already. The city centre is already majority non-white, and the only reason why there appear to be whites there is because of the large tourist contingent who still flock to the great sights that the city has to offer.</p>
<p>If one ventures outside the city centre in the shockingly awful tenement building areas, the true scale of the demographic disaster is obvious.</p>

		<p>&#8220;More than half the babies born in Paris are black.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Muslims running wild and burning 100 cars on average EVERY NIGHT in France by mostly Arab Muslims, coupled with their large black population, France is going to suffer ungodly rioting and violence when their economy continues to move downward to Greek levels.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have far to go, but there hasn&rsquo;t been much reporting of it going on in the press, especially the French press.  I&rsquo;m just wondering if they believe keeping things quiet is a smart strategy, because they will work their way out of it in no time at all.</p>
<p>If so, this shows how far into left field they really are, because they are every bit as much on the verge as any country in Europe.</p>
<p>Much more economic &#8220;surprises&#8221; will pop up out of nowhere this Fall, as if they just occurred spontaneously and were unknown until they erupted.</p>
<p>When they do I&rsquo;d like to send a registered letter to every European head of state, asking, &#8220;How do you like diversity now, elitist fool?&#8221;  <br/>

		<p>I must admit I often wonder what will happen if these demographic trends persist and whites fade into oblivion into formerly-white majority nations such as France. How will the blacks, Muslims, and/or Hispanics manage to maintain the same standard of living - exactly what enticed them to move from their own homelands, however, possible, to partake of the riches in white countries? How will these third-worlders maintain the infrastructure, including heating supplies, basic sanitation, trade networks, and so forth that make white-majority countries such pleasant places to live in?</p>
<p>Answer - they CAN&rsquo;T! When whites disappear from nations such as France, the new colonizers will realize that what they&rsquo;ve inherited is not what they thought they would get, and in the absence of any supporting infrastructure maintenance, moving to Africa may look a lot better than freezing in northern nations.<br/>

Those posters who only want to hear good news and  who scold others for telling it like it is are going to be very upset at this, but it&rsquo;s just the truth.  Sometimes we need to be told the blunt truth to make us snap out of it. No, we don&rsquo;t hate our race. No, we&rsquo;re not praising Arabs and Asians, we&rsquo;re just trying to make our people wake up. </p>

		<p>The article only discusses &#8216;babies born to blacks in Paris&rsquo;. So, this only tallies black mothers? Perhaps, like in America, the &#8216;black birth rate&rsquo; is simply a total of the number of children born to black mothers. Similarly, the white birth rate just counts the number of children born to white mothers and nothing else. So, mixed children are being categorized under either the white or black birth rate. With probably very few black mothers having &#8216;white&rsquo; children and possibly very many white mothers raising children of color. So, if 40% of children are &#8216;born to whites&rsquo; in Paris it does not mean 40% of the children in Paris are white. </p>

<p>The Muslims who rape and riot in France are mostly black Muslims. Arab Muslims are no picnic but they are a dream in heaven compared to the blacks (Muslim or Christian).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to Paris but would like to go before it goes completely Third World.</p>
<p>I like a lot of French &#8220;film noir&#8221; cinema from the late 50s to the late 60s. In the street scenes it is 99% white and blacks stand out because of it. I imagine it is the real Frenchmen who stand out now.</p>

		<p>I saw this a few months ago. The report does not say that 54% of Paris births have sickle cell anemia. What is says is that 54% of Paris births are AT RISK for sickle cell, meaning they are of a race or ethnicity that can develop the disease. It is most commonly found in sub-Saharan Africans, but other races and ethnicities can develop it.</p>
<p>From siinfo.org:<br/>
&#8220;Sickle cell is in many nationalities including African Americans, Africans, Arabs, Greeks, Italians, Latin Americans,  and those from India.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what that map says is that 54% of babies born in Paris are from one those groups listed above. It&rsquo;s still bad news because more than half of babies born in Paris are not ethnically French, but it does not mean that 54% is black.</p>

<p>When will they even notice that there is a problem?  When they only get one meal a day of bread and water before being sent off to work a 12 hour shift in the mines?</p>

		<p>1.4 million Frenchmen were killed fighting Germans in WW1. Another 900,000 were permanently incapacitated. Even in WW2 when the French supposedly laid down (an historical myth by the way. Please see the book 1940 MYTH AND REALITY.) at least 400,000 French soldiers died in combat and several hundred thousand French civilians were killed, including no fewer then 60,000 by British and American air raids. This is what all that sacrifice was for? So that Paris could become a black African city? What a bunch of shmucks, it pains me deeply to say.</p>

		<p>Neanderthals went extinct in Europe because humans outbred them and then took over their territory.  The French won&rsquo;t survive this massive wave of immigration because they breed less than the foreign population.  The political and business elite in French society have decided that the French people will not control their own destiny or the country&rsquo;s instead foreigners who breed like wild will.</p>

		<p>I doubt this is true, seems unrealistic because if 50 percent of all births in Paris are black that still does not account for North African(arabish) births. What would that be? atleast 30 percent. That would mean ATLEAST 80 percent of all births in Paris are non white. I can&rsquo;t fanthom that thought. If by some chance it is true. It is positively all over for France so  lets give up on that country(and other other with similiar demographics) and move on. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been to Paris, so I don&rsquo;t need to ever go again.  Sounds like a dangerous place, anyway.  And, should Germany and other nations decide to pull out of EMU and create a &#8220;Nord-Euro&#8221; currency, France definitely should NOT be invited.</p>

They only thing for certain is that you will not want to visit there (if they even let non-muslims in) by 2050.  </p>

We then, go NOW!   You&rsquo;ve got maybe 15 years before these babies being born today will be out there in the streets rioting. Time is getting short.  Who knows what is coming next?  See it while you can.</p>
<p>Hint: Don&rsquo;t limit yourself to Paris!  It&rsquo;s a mega-big city, very dense, very chaotic (and very expensive). Some wouldn&rsquo;t like that   &mdash;   much too noisy crowded, and hectic. But Paris isn&rsquo;t all of France.  Most French cities are beautiful - smaller versions of Paris - and so are the little villages. You might like them more. You can still see the Old France out there in the provinces.  But hurry!</p>

<p>Courtney, WHAT WHITE NATIONS are &#8220;turning things around?&#8221;</p>
<p>Name ONE.</p>
<p>You rightly say we should be optimistic (in the abstract, it is right). But in the real world, where whites are about six percent of the population, and racially aware ones maybe half of that, and those free to speak up and brave enough to do so less than half of that, YOU DO THE MATH.</p>
<p>We are essentially saying a breakup of the current nations-by choice and within the law, peacefully- is the only rational course, because elitists use us like firewood, and third worlders swamp us in every corner of the world,where we go, they follow, mouths open, rapacious, entitled, greedy.</p>
<p>Catch up to reality.</p>

To answer this question take first a short look at Zimbabwe, than one at South Africa, than a short at Haiti, than a little bit to the left at Detroit, go back to Bronx, and than take a look at the former &#8220;Paris at the middle east&#8221; Baghdad. And if you see what happened to the Paris of the middle east running by half intelligent Arabs, you will see what will happen to the real Paris running by blacks with much lower IQ.</p>
<p>Like I said before: Everyone wants me to send money to Haiti but nobody wants to answer why it is poor but the other side of the Island (which is whiter)  is much richer. </p>

		<p>Lest we feel too much sympathy for the French, we must remember that France glories in bullying and threatening those few remaining eastern and central European states untainted by mass third world immigration, by imposing all sorts of threats, sanctions and adnomitions on them.<br/>
  This is done mainly through France&rsquo;s two pet poodles, namely that execrable pile of trash, the EU, and the &#8216;Council of Europe&rsquo;.</p>

As someone who has family in France and visits often, I can confirm it&rsquo;s mainly Arab/North african muslims who riot every night in Paris. This can be triggered by something as small as their soccer team losing a game. The Blacks are not much better themselves though. </p>

		<p>Message to AR readers:  Anyone who finds themselves in a boxing ring with a dangerous and deadly opponent, an opponent who intends to wipe you off the face of the planet Earth - but you are too spineless and cowed by political correctness to look that enemy in the eye, call out their name, and then start fighting back with all the fury at your disposal - and crush that enemy, well, you&rsquo;re going to lose that fight.   </p>

		<p>Months ago, I read an article about the &#8220;black births&#8221; in Paris and, unable to believe it, researched the background of the facts.  The original findings were that 54% of those born were SUSEPTIBLE to sickle-cell anemia  &mdash;  not necessarily afflicted with the condition or of sub-Saharan origin.  People of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian subcontinental origin are also suseptible.  <br/>
I guess it&rsquo;s no surprise that any Western metropolis might become overrun with non-whites.  Small towns don&rsquo;t want them, and if they don&rsquo;t speak the local language, no one may understand Arabic or whatever foreign tongue the immigrants speak.  So, like blacks in American ghettos, these people throng together in urban areas.  Look at our own capital.</p>

<p>False. The uprising of violence and criminality amongst blacks in FRANCE is a recent trend, following the increasing number of black inhabitants.</p>
<p>North Africans are a problem since they are there and still the majority of criminals.</p>
<p>Also, only about one half of the black peoples are muslims, the other being somewhat christian or animists and still more quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The article only discusses &lsquo;babies born to blacks in Paris&rsquo;. So, this only tallies black mothers?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, it is the midwives (&#8220;sage-femme&#8221;) who decide wich child need to be tested, then the percentage include children of full black and mixed ancestry, some north-africans getting tested as well.</p>
<p><br/>
And I find the last sentence of the document awesome :<br/>
&#8220;La Grande-Bretagne, o√π la situation est tr√®s similaire √† celle pr√©valant en France, a choisi en 2000, pour des raisons √©thiques √©videntes et malgr√© une pr√©tendue tradition communautariste, de g√©n√©raliser le d√©pistage √† l&rsquo;ensemble des nouveau-n√©s sans distinction d&rsquo;origine.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Great Britain, where the situation is very similar, it has been decided in 2000, for ethical reasons and despite an alleged communautarism tradition, to test every child without considering  his origins.</p>

		<p>The more economically advanced (until recently) the white nation, the more the decline.  Look at Russia and Eastern Europe and you see less financially well-off societies and more racial awareness.  Ireland was pretty much 100% white until the Celtic Tiger was created.  The European Union IS Europe&rsquo;s Doom!<br/>

		<p> Paris resembles both London and New York with the same chaotic blend of indigenous and Third World people. I doubt anyone from one hundred years ago would recognize any of the cities. They have lost much of their distinctive European/Western flavor. Many of the landmark buildings are the same but the people are racially and ethnically dissimilar. This is not the same as in Beijing or Tokyo, where the current populations are indistinguishable from the people who lived in their respected cities one hundred or even eight hundred years ago.</p>

		<p>I remember seeing a tourist group a little while ago.  The kids in it were around 12 or 13 years old and they were all black or brown and wearing the latest in hip hop apparel.  It looked like a Bronx public school outing to Manhattan.  Imagine my surprise when I got closer and heard them speaking French.  Not a white kid in the whole group of 20 children or so.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that.  I just spent the month of April in Paris, and have been there many times before. After all that time spent, I still don&rsquo;t know the answer to the question of which group is better or worse. I can&rsquo;t decide.  </p>
<p>Certainly, the blacks stand out more, while many of the Arabs can (and do)  blend in among the French and be inconspicuous. Nor do all of the Arabs dress in Muslim attire, by any means   &mdash;   some are quite modern and are apparently non-religious. But it must be said that Arabs are VERY AGGRESSIVE.  I notice that is a distinct trait of their culture  (or nature?) which I have observed many times elsewhere, it seems to  be a semitic trait: they are loud, they are aggressive, they are always bullying one another.  Even a conversation among them sounds like an argument that&rsquo;s about to become a fight.  The smaller ones and the females especially get bullied. That is why Arab countries are all ruled by dictatorships and &#8220;strong men&#8221;   &mdash;   and always will be. Only strength is respected; gentility is scoffed at as weakness.  They see polite Europeans as contemptibly weak and soft.   Blacks who associate with them may pick up this trait of aggression. Of course, blacks and Arabs live together, grow up together,  in the same massive housing projects  that encircle Paris.  </p>
<p>Blacks can be both docile and violent. But they need to be led, stirred up,  whereas Arabs are volatile by their own nature;  and people who riot and revolt need a rationale to legitimize their behavior and make it seem justified. Here is where Islam provides this convenient rationale, something which non-Moslem blacks don&rsquo;t have, but Moslems do.</p>
<p>I should add that Africans and Arabs, although the most numerous groups, are by no means all. The whole Third World is pouring in. There are Turks, Cambodians, Vietnamese, Antilleans, Polynesians, etc. There are many types of faces unfamiliar to Americans. On my last visit, I discovered a whole Indian/Pakistani settlement (colony) just north of the Gare du Nord. The housekeeping staff in my hotel were all Colombians!   (Unique in that all hotel maids in France are Africans   &mdash;    invariably. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a French hotel maid left in France.  The days of the &#8220;French maid&#8221; are long gone!)     In short, you have EVERYBODY there. Everybody but white and French.</p>

&ldquo;More than half the babies born in Paris are black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;With Muslims running wild and burning 100 cars on average EVERY NIGHT in France by mostly Arab Muslims, coupled with their large black population, France is going to suffer ungodly rioting and violence when their economy continues to move downward to Greek levels.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&rsquo;t have far to go, but there hasn&rsquo;t been much reporting of it going on in the press, especially the French press. I&rsquo;m just wondering if they believe keeping things quiet is a smart strategy, because they will work their way out of it in no time at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;If so, this shows how far into left field they really are, because they are every bit as much on the verge as any country in Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many more economic &ldquo;surprises&rdquo; will pop up out of nowhere this Fall, as if they just occurred spontaneously and were unknown until they erupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they do I&rsquo;d like to send a registered letter to every European head of state, asking, &ldquo;How do you like diversity now, elitist fool?&rdquo; </p>
<p>I agree whole heartedly with these sentiments.  They&rsquo;re right on and I would advise people to take heed.</p>
<p>From reading the above posts it appears that the people here on this forum aren&rsquo;t tuned in to the world economic situation anymore than the ones in Europe.  Everybody has an opinion that considers we are going to go on as we are right now forever, but nobody but the above poster seems to understand that this experiment in Western diversity is headed unequivocally to mass civil violence that is going to turn the entire Western World upside down.  The trends that are in play right now will all have to be re-evaluated certainly by 2012, and likely before then.  Like, right now, in fact.</p>
<p>While there may be more non-white babies born in Paris today, let me assure you that Paris is going to be a scorching cauldron of intense fighting, just as the major cities in the entire West will be.  This isn&rsquo;t scare talk.  It&rsquo;s a valid warning.</p>
<p>And, these warnings are not just given by those of us who are following the situation closely.  Has no one bothered to read what the true experts of ongoing trends and the economic situation have to say on the subject?  Has no one tracked their prior forecasts and found them to be uncannily accurate?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if people are blowing all this off as mere &#8220;wishful thinking,&#8221; because they believe the messengers want to see mass upheaval occurring and that things will somehow work themselves out, but there isn&rsquo;t one expert predicting doom and gloom that I know of who would profit from it.  Not one.  In fact every one of them, just like the rest of us, will have their lives  devastated by civil strife.  And these men are extremely sophisticated about the entire situation in the WORLD today, not just the economic problems.</p>
<p>The leftists in the media and politics are talking about &#8220;green shoots&#8221; and the possibility that we are beginning &#8220;to come out of it,&#8221; referring to the current downturn.  At the worst, they&rsquo;re saying we are going to have another mild recession, a &#8220;double-dip.&#8221;  These are the same politicians who refused to admit this ongoing catastrophic financial meltdown signified a recession as late as 2008.  They offer optimistic predictions partly because their world will come crashing down when multiculturalism destroys the Western World, and partly because they&rsquo;ve been further indoctrinated into believing the leftist drivel they tell each other at their many cocktail parties in D.C. and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The fools are &#8220;fiddling&#8221; as Rome burns.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Courtney, WHAT WHITE NATIONS are &#8216;turning things around?&rsquo;<br/>
Name ONE. You rightly say we should be optimistic (in the abstract, it is right). But in the real world, where whites are about six percent of the population, and racially aware ones maybe half of that, and those free to speak up and brave enough to do so less than half of that, YOU DO THE MATH.<br/>
We are essentially saying a breakup of the current nations-by choice and within the law, peacefully- is the only rational course, because elitists use us like firewood, and third worlders swamp us in every corner of the world,where we go, they follow, mouths open, rapacious, entitled, greedy.<br/>
Catch up to reality.&#8221;</p>
<p><br/>
Eastern Europe, as a whole, is still very racially conscious and I don&rsquo;t see evidence for them changing their demographics. Spain and Italy have been raising eyebrows lately with immigration policies they have been imposing. The far right has been gaining ground in Portugal, Denmark, Holland, and Belgium, and to a degree in Germany and Austria, as well as parts of Scandinavia, and Switzerland.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see much craziness coming out of New Zealand or the white countries of Latin America.  They seem to be pretty sound.  There are good stories coming out of Australia from time to time, and in America, there is obviously a growing under current forming, if you haven&rsquo;t noticed.</p>
<p>England, France, and Canada are the three white countries that don&rsquo;t seem to be getting anything right, and I should throw America in that mix as well.</p>
<p>For you to say that &#8220;nothing positive is happening in the white world&#8221; completely turns your argument on its head. How much faith in your people do you really have&hellip;&hellip;or do you just always see the glass half full?</p>
<p>Once again, &hellip;.what good does this pessimism do for us?  These off the wall predictions about how the entire Third World is going to engulf the Western World without a shot being fired by any white person, are just ridiculous.  You really believe that is going to happen?  </p>
<p>Look around the world.  It is in the places where diversity is taking over more and more, in which whites are reacting more and more.  And even in a country like France, how do we know that the common people aren&rsquo;t fed up?  Don&rsquo;t just look at what the leaders are doing.</p>
<p>The fact that people on here actually think that white people are just going to sit there as their countries become engulfed 100%&hellip;..until &#8220;bye bye Western World&#8221;&hellip;..to me that is just insane.  It shows me what lowly of an opinion you have of whites.  We are just a bunch of losers aren&rsquo;t we?  We have never fought a fight ever in our history&hellip;.right?</p>
<p>And for you to imply that posters such as myself are denying reality&hellip;&hellip;what are you talking about?  The ship is sinking.  I am the person who is happy that there are enough life boats for everyone to get into.  You are the person who stands there saying &#8220;we are all going to die&#8221;!</p>
<p>I am not denying reality and I never said everything is peaches and lollipops.  But making these worst case scenario predictions like &#8220;whites have no future&hellip;we will get wiped off the Earth&#8221; are absurd and they hurt more than help.  What is the point in this website if people like you can predict that &#8220;whites don&rsquo;t have a future for sure&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;We are essentially saying a breakup of the current nations-by choice and within the law, peacefully- is the only rational course, because elitists use us like firewood, and third worlders swamp us in every corner of the world,where we go, they follow, mouths open, rapacious, entitled, greedy.&#8221; </p>
<p> Glad to see you are at least proposing a plan. But most pessimists on here don&rsquo;t do this, so I don&rsquo;t know why you start off with &#8220;we&#8221;. It is the people who make worst case scenario predictions that I get tired of, as if there is no plan at all&hellip;we are doomed no matter what. You can&rsquo;t possibly tell me those sorts of posts do us any good. </p>

<p>A map of the areas of the world where the native populations are susceptible to sickle-cell anaemia can be found at the Wikipedia page of the said disease: <a href="../../../../wiki/File_Sickle_cell_distribution.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sickle_cell_distribution.jpg</a></p>
<p>As the map shows, the hot-beds of genetic propensity to the disease are, indeed, black Africa and India with less severe propensity around the Persian Gulf, Turkey and the Balkans, with French North Africa totally outside of the area with the genetic propensity. </p>
<p>As the vast majority of the legions of non-black Muslims in France are indeed North Africans rather than Muslims from any other part of the world, my quess would be that out of the 54% maybe 50 percentage points are indeed black Africans/descendants of the black slave populations from the French Caribbean with the remaining few points mostly Turks and Indians, and, yes, the coloured total with the Algerians, Moroccans and Tunisians (plus the Chinese, Vietnamese, Latin American mestizos etc.) included would in my estimation as well certainly be at least the 80%, which poster number 12 mentioned.  </p>
<p>And to be more specific, it&rsquo;s not Paris, really, it&rsquo;s the administrative region of Ile-de-France, which consists of Metropolitan Paris - that means all the posh, white, bourgeois neighbourhoods surrounding the immigrant ghettoes as well - plus quite a lot of the surrounding countryside. That&rsquo;s an area with a population of 12 million - almost a fifth of Metropolitan France - and an area of 12 000 square kilometres, so if you were to see the coloured percentage of newly bornes in just the city of Paris, I&rsquo;d expect the figures to be grimmer still.</p>
<p>I for one certainly don&rsquo;t doubt the vericity of the &#8220;at least 80%&#8221; figure concerning Ile-de-France. Everyone I know who&rsquo;s been to Paris recently speaks of a European minority on the streets and those people certainly confined themselves in the touristy districts and stayed well clear of the banlieus where there are no little white passengers in prams. Also, if you look at the percentages for the south-eastern regions around the second and third-largest cities of Marseille and Lyon and add an estimate for North Africans on them (there are masses of them especially in Marseille), I&rsquo;d expect that European babies are already a minority in those areas as well, or at the verge at least. </p>
<p>France can still theoretically pull itself out of the mess it&rsquo;s in via democratic means, but the time for that is certainly running out. After that, it&rsquo;s either surrender or Reconquista the old-fashioned way, and neither will be pretty.       </p>

<p>I love your fighting spirit. It is like that of the pioneering women in the American West, who joined their menfolk by arming themselves, in fighting off attacks from American Indian tribes.</p>
<p>But you have never been to New Zealand, have you, Courtney? New Zealand is a much more politically-correct nation than the US and Britain. The only thing that has prevented New Zealand from being completely overwhelmed by third world immigrants, is the fact that they are in a geographically remote region of the world, and are completely surrounded by the sea. Even then, third world immigrants have managed to make their way to New Zealand.</p>
<p>The white population of New Zealand is now 78 percent, down from over 90 percent in the 1980s. There were virtually no Asians in New Zealand in the 1970s, but Asians are now 9.2 percent of the population. The country is also receiving substantial immigration from Pacific Islanders, who are adding on to the native Maori tribes. Here is the Wikipedia entry for New Zealand: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand</a></p>
<p>Australia has done a better job in fighting immigration, but, they too, benefit from being an Island nation located in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by ocean. Mexicans cannot walk into their countries, and Cuban and Haitian rafts cannot reach their shores. Eastern European nations are protected by their poverty, and their hard-to-learn languages. Not too many third worlders want to go to Ukraine, Romania, Lithuania, Slovakia, Moldova, or Bulgaria. Because of the poverty of those nations, business owners do not need to import third worlders to provide cheap labor, because the citizens of those countries work dirt cheap labor. Many East European nations have a GDP per capita lower than Mexico.</p>
<p>Spain, Italy, and the white countries of Latin America, may be the last best hope for the white race. Because those nations have a Catholic-Fascist political tradition, that puts the interests of the state above that of the individual, they will not hesitate to carry out a mass expulsion of thirdworlders, if they feel that their national survival is in danger. When Spain was under the rule of Isabella and Ferdinand in the 1490s, they kicked out the Muslims and other non-Catholics from their country.</p>
<p>Anglo-Celtic nations have a strong tradition of democracy and individual rights, with strong protections for minorities, which makes it harder to fight third world immigration. But nations such as Italy provide incentives to white Italian women to give birth to more babies, without torturing themselves over whether or not such policies discriminate against racial minorities. The price that Europe may have to pay to remain white, may be to reject the Anglo-American tradition of individual rights, and adopt the Catholic-Fascist tradition of national rights.</p>

		<p>BJohnson,</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing out those facts, and I am glad you agree with me about the Southern Europeans.  So you support my argument that it is foolish for anybody to come here acting as if nothing good is going on with the white race.</p>
<p>I am confused on why you told me about all the Asian immigration to New Zealand, but then you make up excuses as to why it is so easy for the Australians to do as well as they do staying somewhat pure. I am not stupid.  I never suggested that Mexicans can cross the Rio Grande to Australia.  That argument is irrelevant anyways, considering that you just got done explaining to me all the immigration that their close neighbor, New Zealand receives.</p>
<p>The Eastern European countries are much better off than most of the world.  You are listing me all these excuses as to why certain white countries are doing so well staying pure.  Why is this relevant?  The fact is that we should be happy that they are staying pure to begin with.  </p>
<p>If we list all these reasons for why certain white countries stay pure, then we need to apply the same logic to the rest of the world too. The Chinese don&rsquo;t stay pure because they are smarter than us, but because they are not as well off as us&hellip;etc&hellip;  Are we not allowed to compliment whites for anything anymore?  Maybe a lot of white countries a doing fine right now simply due to their own merits, just like the Chinese.</p>

		<p>COURTNEY WROTE: <br/>
 These off the wall predictions about how the entire Third World is going to engulf the Western World without a shot being fired by any white person, are just ridiculous. You really believe that is going to happen? </p>
<p>It already is happening&hellip;whites are still playing in a LA LA land like it was fifty years ago. The USA had about 220 million people here when I was born, and 90% were white. Today, merely 45 years later, we&rsquo;re over 300 million, less than 70% white, 75% of our population growth is from immigrants and their offspring, and 90% of those immigrants are from the third world. <br/>
That&rsquo;s an utterly insane change of environment, which is a good response to your question&hellip;&#8221;do you really think that&rsquo;s going to happen?&#8221;<br/>
Well, if you asked your average white Joe or Jane in, say, 1955, if America would look like it is today-if whites would be visited by 14,000 black on white RAPES per year, if whites would be visited by a black on white crime rate 50 times greater than white on black; if whites would be officially, stridently excluded from equal treatment under even federal law, what would Joe or Jane say to you?<br/>
They&rsquo;d say, Courtney, are you crazy? Of course that would never happen, it&rsquo;s Ludicrous&hellip;who would let such a travesty occur? What massive stupidity, dereliction and insanity would it take? White folks are smarter, and have more self-respect than to let this great place go to hell.<br/>
Fast forward to 2010. SURPRISE! Whitres have been that derelict.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a &#8220;plan,&#8221; just a wish to extricate European-based history, genes and all that entails, from the unstoppable crush of billions and billions of third worlders. (Side note: I bear no animosity to those people. I just want what everybody wants; to live my life in a way I choose, as I was brought up to live, in a way which my whole society once believed was good and true). <br/>
Remember that in the early 20th century, whites were a sizeable proportion of the world&rsquo;s population. Today, we&rsquo;re less than 10%, and third world births are going supernova, and immigration is only even showing SIGNS of MAYBE slowing down, due to a very serious economic down turn. It&rsquo;s all about the money. (So short-sighted are money grubbing politicians and leaders, and so blind are the average citizens). </p>
<p>I -and a lot of others- don&rsquo;t want to see the Malthusian hell that faces the world at large, come to us in our own towns.  (But what am I saying&hellip;I&rsquo;m a native of Miami Fl. Then I moved. And I moved again. And soon, I&rsquo;ll be moving AGAIN). Since I&rsquo;m NOT going to live in a slum, or adapt to undesireable foreign cultures, or be killed in my front yard, or carry a gun, or shoot it out with anybody, I do what a sane, rational white man does: find a good, clean, safe place&hellip;but they&rsquo;re fading fast.<br/>
I&rsquo;m not going to be a lone revolutionary, a whacko-as the culture at large would brand anybody who went militant-I&rsquo;m not going to bring grief to my family, friends and loved ones. And I well understand that there are millions of good third worlders-even if they want to replace my culture-so I&rsquo;m not about to advocate any sort of violence.  So I do what all good whites do&hellip;move, again! That makes me civil and pragmatic, not a defeatist. <br/>
But Courtney, it&rsquo;s the juxtaposition of being so aware of the disaster in a world where most whites are like zombies-and also being civil, peaceful (although well capable of self defense), that makes so many posters seem incredibly bitter. They are bitter. Who ever imagined the west would lay down and die?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not defeatist. We can multiply. We can add. We can also face the inevitable truth that, just as there are limited resources in the world, white lands have become enclaves, and truly white places are truly, truly small- and shrinking. We think that race war (like all war) is horrible, and we want to see a sane new world order. Let liberal panty waist marxist whites live in the hell they want. Let them be chased down the street by the third worlders who were so lovingly brought in. Let the third worlders keep a slice of the land dumb whites actually GAVE to them. <br/>
Let whites who want to live free, safe, smart, healthy lives, form new states, unions, nations.<br/>
The alternatives? all too grim to speak of.<br/>
Courtney, that&rsquo;s just common sense. Would that it were different.<br/>
And, as an aside, I have so many white friends that loathe whiteness and Westernness, and Christianity, and all the things that gave said friends a chance to live relatively rich, free, long and well.<br/>
They&rsquo;re lost to sense, lost to reality. They will NOT recover their bearings, as many of them were brainwashed s children.<br/>
So, yeah, I don&rsquo;t have that much faith in &#8220;white people.&#8221; Only about 20% of them have the sense and the backbone to even potentially do the right thing before it&rsquo;s too late. <br/>

<p>Way back in 1974 (half a lifetime ago, and before most of today&rsquo;s French citizens were born), the French government of the day announced that all mass immigration would henceforth cease into perpetuity, and France that moment onwards was to be regarded as a nation of &#8216;zero immigration&rsquo;.  Yes, you&rsquo;ve read right, that proclamation was made loudly and officially at the highest possible level.<br/>
 Only this fact is marred by the fact that a big majority of France&rsquo;s third world immigrant population entered AFTER 1974, and they continue to enter in their hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>MORAL:</p>
<p><br/>
Never, but never even attempt to believe any words uttered from a politician&rsquo;s mouth.     </p>

		<p>Anonymous,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we are ever going to agree, and I find your posts hard to understand sometimes.  It seems you agree with me on some points, but then you keep going back to your original conclusion.</p>
<p>I came on here suggesting that we shouldn&rsquo;t assume the entire West will just sit aside and let everything be engulfed. I said the ENTIRE West.  You come back on here and in response, say that it is already happening, and you only base it on what you see happening here in America.</p>
<p>And then you end your post by saying &#8220;you have little faith in white people&#8221;.</p>
<p>But yet, I can come on here and list several white countries that are doing things right.  This is why I will never accept  your &#8220;sky is falling&#8221; argument.  I think it is defeatist, it doesn&rsquo;t do us any good, and it is also false.  If you follow this website long enough, plenty of good news stories show up.  And that is what we have to draw our strength from, and perhaps look to see what we can do to move things along faster.</p>
<p>What are your goals?  If you were to come on here and say okay, this and this is what we need to do. &hellip;.I would respect your posts more.  What I get tired of are these worst case scenario predictions made by pessimists in general that are irrational from every angle.  It is impossible for them to be the least bit true when posters such as myself can sit here and list things that are turning in the right direction.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t monitor any progress that is going on, then what good do websites such as this do?  What good are people like Jared Taylor doing?  I personally think it is insulting to be such a pessimist when in the mean time people like him are putting their faces out in public trying to make things better, and they are.  </p>
<p>You have to look at underlying trends, and not at what LEADERS in white countries are doing only.  You also have to look at the big picture.  Just because it is like this in Paris, does this mean every white city and town is the same?  It would be irrational for you to suggest such a thing, and to come to the &#8220;dooms day&#8221; conclusions you come to based only on what you see happening in America and a city like Paris.</p>
<p>I have come to the conclusion that there is no so sense in arguing with you.  And there are plenty of posters on this website who think the way I do.  We are the fighters.  We aren&rsquo;t the ones sitting around saying &#8220;oh whites have no future&hellip;.nothing is good&hellip;..let&rsquo;s all go home and cry because there is nothing we can do about it&#8221;.</p>
<p>Posters like me use this website for its intended purpose.  We want to do what is necessary to preserve our race, and in order to do that we have to look at the good steps we are taking, and build on that.  Pessimistic posters choose by choice to be miserable people, and there is nothing I can say to them to change them.  Just don&rsquo;t pull the rest of us down with you, when we are trying to have faith in our people and move forward.</p>

		<p>Not all news is good news, but it&rsquo;s important to know what&rsquo;s going on.  The news from France can be very depressing.  Their government if the worst possible enemy of the French people. It does not even acknowledge such a thing as a  &#8220;French people.&#8221; </p>
<p>Here are some  appalling comments made at a recent meeting by Eric Besson, the French &#8220;Minister of Immigration and National Identity&#8221; (!!!) </p>
<p>&#8220;France is neither a people, nor a language, nor a territory, nor a religion; it is a conglomerate of peoples who want to live together. There is no ethnic Frenchman, there is only an ethnically mixed France.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;There is only a France of &#8216;m√©tissage&rsquo;&#8221;, i.e., &#8220;there is only a France where the blood is mixed.&#8221; Besson has written off completely the existence of a white, European France.</p>
<p>He assured them [the Arab/Black audence]  that France was generous in terms of granting asylum, that 110,000 foreigners every year obtained French nationality.</p>
<p>The debate on national identity launched by Eric Besson, on orders from President Sarkozy, is not only <b> a strategy for taking votes away from the Front National, </b>but it is especially an operation of propaganda on m√©tissage [miscegenation]. The minister said it himself:</p>
<p>&#8220;The mission I have received from the president says: &#8216;Our nation is of mixed blood. Immigration constitutes a source of permanent enrichment of our national identity&rsquo;. We have a president who is saying: &#8216;I am a person of mixed blood at the head of a nation of mixed blood&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within 15-20 years, perhaps sooner, there will be a tipping point. It&rsquo;s inevitable.  France is walking on thin ice, though many Frenchmen seem not to realize it. At least, hardly anybody in France dares to speak of it. Those who do are booed, ridiculed, imprisoned, fined, disgraced, silenced.  The following was written by a Frenchman living in America:</p>
<p>I have not been back to France since the 1970&rsquo;s. Even in 1975 I noticed a change from the 1960&rsquo;s. It is hard to pinpoint what happened, but there was an unmistakable deterioration in the ambience of Paris. Many years latern  I learned that in 1974, the immigration laws had been changed to allow for family reunification. This meant that whole families, of North Africans especially, not just the men, would be free to enter France; this in turn would mean rapid growth of the Maghrebin [North African]  population. I believe that the country began to sense it was doomed. However, life went on. If you were there in the 80&rsquo;s it is entirely possible that you would have had a lovely time and been totally unaware of the problems that were growing stealthily.</p>
<p>In 1974 the Eurabia project was agreed upon. This was an arrangement between the European powers and the Arab/Muslim countries whereby Muslims would be allowed to enter European countries in great numbers and would be guaranteed the right to practice their religion and to keep their customs,  <b>in exchange for access to oil. </b> So, first the borders of the European countries were opened. The rest followed predictably. At first, the newcomers adapted fairly well. But they had children, and the children are now in open rebellion against the host countries.</p>
<p>France began spending huge amounts of money on the newcomers - free education, housing, medical care, etc&hellip; More and more of them came. The French law separating Church and State was abrogated almost at once, since the immigrants demanded mosques. Theoretically, it is illegal for the French Republic to pay for religious edifices, but they trampled on their own law to appease the Muslims. There are now about 2500 mosques in France, and hundreds more on the books.  The Muslims &#8220;rent&#8221; the land from the municipalities for a token sum - usually one euro per month. There are many giant mosques that are also schools and centers of Islamic culture - language, Koranic studies, etc&hellip; These structures have been sprouting up like weeds all over France.</p>
<p>Predictably, crime became rampant and whole sections of the suburbs surrounding the big cities became lawless areas where the police dare not venture. Predictably too, the school system rapidly deteriorated. So Islamization, and its corollary - the de-Christianization of Europe - proceeded apace.</p>
<p>But in addition, France, and 26 other European countries, renounced their national sovereignty by becoming vassals of Brussels. Most legislation emanating from the French National Assembly is dictated by directives from <b> the European Union, a highly secretive, answerable-to-no-one organization, dedicated to open borders, Islamization, and the prosecution of any and all discrimination, KGB-style.  </b>Sarkozy pushed France into the EU despite French opposition  (in 2005, the French had voted AGAINST adopting the Lisbon Treaty that governs the EU.)   </p>
<p>In Europe today, it does not matter how you vote. The results have already been decided upon. </p>
<p>Finally came &#8220;m√©tissage&#8221; - what we call micegenation.  <b>Sarkozy, even more so than his predecessors, has been promoting mixed marriages. In a notorious speech he gave in December 2008, he warned the French that they would have to &#8220;mix&#8221; or the Republic would see to it that they did. &#8220;You have to change&#8221; he told them.  </b></p>
<p>The tragedy for the rest of Europe is that the EU and its organs are designed &hellip; by the French.  My fear is that what happens in France will become official EU directives.</p>
<p>The obsession with &#8220;race-mixing&#8221; is absurd coming from people who also believe that &#8220;race doesn&rsquo;t exist&#8221;. It is a form of bigotry. At heart they sincerely believe that opposition to immigration is based on nativist race purism and nothing else. Of course Jacobins could never understand the phenomenon of ethnicity in any terms other than the Hitlerian so it comes as no surprise.</p>
<p>I still believe the country can be saved. The heartland is still there, as it always was. But with every passing day, we are closer to some kind of catastrophe, if someone doesn&rsquo;t do something. It is up to the people, but they don&rsquo;t know what to do. Many are predicting civil war, others predict a complete capitulation to Islam.</p>

		<p>Here is a letter dated July 5, 2010, from Brigitte Bardot to Nicolas Sarkozy:</p>
<p>Mr. President,</p>
<p>You and your ministers, as useless as you are cowardly, almost to the point of dishonesty and ridiculousness, are not succeeding and will never succeed in satisfying the French population who elected you in 2007, believing firmly in your promises, which you have not kept!</p>
<p>Every president leaves traces of his term in power. Yours, which seems to be of a troubling negativity and mediocrity, could become the first to give to the weakest of the weak, to those exterminated amidst general indifference, a definitive and irreversible betterment that would be an unforgettable example to the world.</p>
<p>I leave you to reflect in your soul and conscience, assuming you have them!</p>
<p>Brigitte Bardot</p>

<i>July 14, Bastille Day, has passed. The French government has refused to release the number of burned automobiles for that date.  Here is a public comment from the Front National. </i></p>
<p>Press release of Alexandre SIMONNOT, Departmental Secretary of the FN in Seine-Saint-Denis, member of the Central Committee of the Front National: </p>
<p>The decision  taken not to release the number of burned automobiles at the time of the festivities of July 14  is scandalous. The French people have the right to know where the government truly stands as regards security. For that, the number of burned automobiles on July 14 is an excellent index. If the Ministry of the Interior refuses to communicate this information, it is because this figure is bad   &mdash;   perhaps even worse than last year. </p>
<p>At the time of his his televised interview  on July 12, Nicolas Sarkozy bragged of  having  obtained spectacular results in the matter of the  fight against delinquency.  Therefore, why doesn&rsquo;t he want to give us these figures,  if they are so spectacular? </p>
<p>This refusal to inform our compatriots is an admission of failure on the part of the government. It is the failure of a government which wants to fight insecurity without attacking the true causes of it,  which are its suicidal immigration policy and its refusal to increase the number of police officers. http://www.frontnational.com/</p>

		<p>I regret to disappoint those who are looking for good news, but here is an interview with Jean Raspail, author of the well known book, &#8220;Camp of the Saints&#8221;, as published in Le Figaro Magazine.   He is not optimistic.   To my shock and disappointment, he says he has nothing further to add to what he already said.  My instincts  recoil and I  do not want to agree with him, but here, abbreviated,  is what he says:<br/>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I circled around this topic like a dog-trainer in the presence of a parcel bomb.  It is, however, the one question of capital importance. Especially since in 1973, by publishing The Camp of The Saints, I had already said it all. I do not have a great deal to add, except to say that the the goose is cooked.</p>
<p>I am convinced that the fate of France is sealed, because &#8220;My house is their house&#8221; (Mitterand), inside &#8220;Europe whose roots are as much Muslim as Christian&#8221; (Chirac), because the situation is moving irreversibly towards the final tumble in 2050 which will see French stock amounting to only half the population of the country (the oldest members), the youthful remainder composed of black Africans, North Africans and Asians of all sorts from the inexhaustible reserve of the Third World, predominantly Islamic,  fundamentalist jihadists. This dance is only the beginning.</p>
<p>France is not the only concern. All of Europe marches to its death. The warnings are numerous - the UN report (which delighted some!), incontrovertible works by others - these are systematically buried, and the National Institute for Demographic Studies [INED] pushes disinformation.</p>
<p>The almost <b>sepulchral silence of the media, governments, and community institutions on the demographic crash of the European Union is one of the more striking phenomena of our time. </b> When there is a birth in my family or in the homes of my friends, I cannot look at this infant of our own stock without reflecting upon what negligent governments have in store for him and what he will have to face in his adulthood.</p>
<p>Not to mention that those of French stock, bludgeoned by the drumbeat of  &#8220;human rights&#8221;,  of &#8220;the welcome to the outsider&#8221;, of the &#8220;sharing&#8221; that is dear to our bishops,  closed in by a whole arsenal of repressive measures known as &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; laws, conditioned from early childhood to cultural and behavioral &#8220;crossbreeding&#8221;, to the requirements of a &#8220;pluralistic France,&#8221; they  will have no choice but to reduce the price of non-conformity by blending into the new mould of the  &#8220;French  citizen&#8221; of 2050, without uttering a syllable of protest.</p>
<p>All the same, let us not despair. Without doubt, there will remain what is called in ethnology some &#8216;isolates&rsquo;, minorities, perhaps about 15 million French - not necessarily all of the white race - who will still speak our language and who will insist on remaining true to our culture and our history. It will not be easy for them.</p>
<p>This will be frowned upon, and the conflict will take place sooner or later. It will be something like the elimination of the Kulaks by suitable legal means. And then what?</p>
<p>Then France, with all ethnic origins mixed together in confusion, will no longer be peopled by a species vanished forever called the French species   &mdash;  - a species that can in no way claim to be the ancestors of those who will call themselves <br/>
French&#8221;  in the second half of this century. This process is already underway.</p>
<p>Since we are in the mood for quotations, here  [is a quote ] to conclude: <b> &#8220;No amount of atomic bombs will be able to dam up the tidal wave of millions of human beings that will one day leave the southernmost and poorest parts of the world, to invade the relatively open spaces of the wealthy northern hemisphere, in search of survival.&#8221;  </b> &hellip; (Algerian President Boumedi√®ne, March 1974.)<br/>

		<p>My prediction is it is not like white people in Paris, France aren&rsquo;t giving birth&hellip;. it is just muslims in France are giving too many births.  In Canada, it is common for married muslim people to have 5+ children for some reason.  I also read 1 out of every three births is from muslim families in Canada nowadays.  </p>
<p>(I am guessing another 1 out of every three births in Canada are East Asian or Carribbean)</p>

<p>It seems inevitable that  eventually one of these riots will flare up,  grow, and spread to other suburbs, cities, and regions. Perhaps to other countries. When Marseilles or Lyons are  in flames   &mdash;   then Rotterdam, Brussels, Malmo will soon follow. Modern Europeans seem to lack the conviction and  ruthlessness that will be needed to put these flames out   &mdash;   and so they will spread.  You cannot be &#8220;nice&#8221;, pacify the rioters, and still extinguish the rioting, which will turn into open rebellion.  It&rsquo;s just a matter of time.</p>
<p>Perhaps an oil crisis, collapse of the Euro,  bankruptcy of a major country, or some other  calamity  (human or natural) will bring it on.   When the welfare benefits stop or are reduced, there will be hell to pay in the banlieues as the inhabitants march into the center cities to take what they need from the disarmed, terrified populace encircled by a ring of alien suburbs that hate and envy them.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I speculate on how we -  on this side of the Atlantic -  will view this (or will be <i>permitted </i> to view it).   How will it be presented by our media?    Will our media first ignore the situation, then  play it down as just a bit of excessive exuberance on the part of high-spirited &#8220;French youth&#8221;?   Will there be any racial/religous aspect acknowledged at all?    Or perhaps it will be sympathetically presented as the justified reaction of downtrodden people who have suffered abuse and discrimination beyond what they could bear.   And  (fascinating question)  how will &#8220;minorities&#8221; in this country react?  Will they be demanding that Washington aid the rioters?&hellip;or bar any aid to the Paris government?</p>
<p>What will be the position of our government?&hellip; (if our government even chooses to recognize what&rsquo;s happening).   When will it be recognized as revolt and no longer isolated rioting?    Will we be sending them aid, and to which side?  Will our assistance to the French government (if any) be strictly contingent on the condition that it not be used to harm the rioters in any way?  Will an Obama require Paris to make dramatic concessions?    All of this remains interesting speculation.   Well, time will tell.  And it&rsquo;s coming. </p>

		<p>ghw,</p>
<p>I am a little confused.  Just recently you yourself got irritated with pessimists on here, and you wrote a post that was very similar word for word to the posts I used to always write.  I was actually very impressed with that post.</p>
<p>I am not naive on this topic, and I never said that &#8220;most things going on right now are positive&#8221;.  I don&rsquo;t understand why I am getting singled out because I like to look at the good things going on on top of the bad.  I think this is a healthy way to look at things.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree that what is going on in France is bad, as it is bad in England, and America, and Canada.  I made that clear before.  But it is also foolish for us to ignore the countries in Europe that are making progress in the right direction&hellip;..these countries who&rsquo;s right wing parties continue to gain votes.  Jared Taylor writes and talks about these developments from time to time.  I have listened to one of his speeches on the progress in Europe on a cassette tape from one of the conferences.  Why do posters on here choose to ignore stuff like this? </p>
<p>Gee whiz, I never said everything was perfect now did I?  I just think we need to focus on what is positive also.</p>

		<p>Dear Courtney:  I also enjoy hearing good news   &mdash;  - when there is good news to hear. I ardently wish there were more of it. But what I see in Europe lately is not, overall, very good or very encouraging, the way things are going, and it would be false to pretend otherwise. There is some good news, yes, but not a lot.  When there is bad news, or any news, I think it is important for people to know it, not brush it aside and concentrate only on happy news. Merely reporting the bad news is not wallowing in it or relishing it.  (Perhaps that is what you have misunderstood.)   In fact, I DEPLORE the bad news (and said so),  but we need to hear it. Yes, you&rsquo;re right that ideally we ought to focus on the positive, when and where we can find it, but we also need to know the ENTIRE truth, even when it&rsquo;s not so happy as we might like.</p>
<p>Like you,  I get very upset with posters  who say it&rsquo;s all over so let&rsquo;s just give up and die. I have said to them previously that if you feel it&rsquo;s so hopeless, then why do you even bother to post here?  Why waste the effort to say anything?   Go lie down and die then, but don&rsquo;t sow gloom and try to discourage the rest of us. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I don&rsquo;t feel that merely REPORTING the truth about what&rsquo;s going on is going to  discourage people. I would hope it would work TO THE CONTRARY.  If you were on a sinking liner, would you say don&rsquo;t tell the passengers because we don&rsquo;t want to get them upset?  Sometimes people need a good shaking, a jolt, a sharp slap, to snap them awake to danger and make them take necessary action. Sheltering them from bad news and telling  them that everything is going well only lulls them back to sleep again. Humans by nature want to avoid unpleasantness or confrontation, if possible; they prefer to continue sleeping if they can. That is what Europeans are doing, and have been doing, for 3 or 4 decades now. Even the European television and papers make a policy to avoid reporting the bad news, especially anything racial or that is negative about imigrants.  And the French government suppresses the bad news that it doesn&rsquo;t want the public to hear. We see the result!</p>
<p>These articles quoted above, as from Jean Raspail, are from people who are French and who know their subject. Should they not be heard because the news is not too good?  I believe that you  disagree with me on this one point: <b> I don&rsquo;t think they are &#8220;pessimistic&#8221;, but rather they are sounding  a warning call  that needs to be heard. </b>Americans, particularly,  need to be jolted awake and  made to realize how far-gone France is, so that we can avoid the same fate.  Many  Americans simply don&rsquo;t realize what the situation is. They still picture Paris as it was in old movies, with Leslie Caron and Gene Kelly happily  dancing about.  Even tourists who go there today and confine themselves to the major attractions, will never likely see the swarming immigrant  settlements that ring the city on its outskirts&hellip;  (as with all large European cities today)&hellip;not unless they get lost.  There is no touristic reason to venture out there, so they don&rsquo;t know.  Even the sheltered, coddled French elite seem to be blithely unaware of the hostile masses that surround them.  They naively assume that  these people are in the process of becoming good Frenchmen&hellip;.just give them another generation and everyone will be assimilated. Yeah!   Well, they are in for a big surprise. They urgently need to hear some &#8220;bad&#8221; news!</p>
<p>The shrewd, devious,  neocon Sarkozy  - a politician through and through -  is using a delaying tactic by tossing the French public a lollipop, and hoping to pacify them a little longer. He is stalling.   Meanwhile, he is making 110,000 new French citizens a year. That&rsquo;s 1,100,000 every ten years, not counting the immigrant baby boom and the family reunification members brought in. This anti-burkha law would be good news, in itself,  but is far, far from enough.   You say it is  &#8220;a beginning&#8221;, but many  don&rsquo;t see it as that;  they see it as a cynical attempt to deceive the voters, as Sarkozy has done all along, while he buys time.   Unfortunately, it is an attempt (as quoted in the interview above) to steal votes away from the Front National.  And THAT is harmful, not good.  As Ms.Bardot said in her letter, he has deceived the voters  for three years  on all his  election promises.  And he has gotten away with it  (with the help of the media)  by suppressing the bad news and bragging about his achievements.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s a simple fact that very few women   actually wear the burkha in France anyway. (Frankly, I can&rsquo;t remember ever seeing any.)  So, the law is largely irrelevant because it affects so few. What they need to do is stop the building of mosques, stop the government  funding of Islamic centers, stop the importation of more immigrants. But that, Sarkozy will never do, as he is wedded to the concepts of Eurabia and Eurafrica, and to the goal of racial mixing.</p>
<p>I hope that we can see eye to eye on this much. You say,<i> &#8220;I am not naive on this topic, and I never said that &ldquo;most things going on right now are positive&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t understand why I am getting singled out.&#8221;</i>    Courtney, perhaps you are referring to someone else, not me.  You must be.  I have not said you are &#8220;naive&#8221; nor have I said ANYTHING about you at all.  I have not quoted you, or even mentioned you, much less have I &#8220;singled you out&#8221;.    Therefore, I&rsquo;ll assume  that you&rsquo;re referring to somebody else and that I have no need to apologize for giving offense. Please do not take personal offense where there was none. I hope we remain friends and that we are in agreement on the major topics, even if we occasionally disagree on minor things here and there, which is only natural among those who are working for the same goals.</p>

		<p>People keep talking about &#8220;Muslims&#8221; here.  In France today, there is relatively little recent immigration from Arab and non-African Muslim countries and the birth rate for people of North African descent in France is low(as it is in their home countries today).</p>
<p>Most of the recent immigration to France is coming from black Africa and these immigrants bring with them the extremely high birth rates of their home countries.  Some of these people are Muslim or nominally Muslim but many aren&rsquo;t.  Needless to say, the behavior of blacks is worse than that of Arabs. Many other European countries are also experiencing an explosion of black African immigration. </p>
<p>This is why the Geert Wilders approach of only criticizing Muslims while denying racial differences is doomed.  Even if all Muslims were ejected from Europe, the continent will be majority non-white in a few decades because of black and other non-Muslim immigration.</p>

		<p>ghw,</p>
<p>I was talking to all the posters above who have been arguing against optimism.  All I am saying is what you acknowledge in your second paragraph there:  that it is irritating when people say there is not a  future and do nothing but complain.  Those were the posters I was arguing with.</p>
<p>When you came back and put all those articles up about France, you kept directing them towards the people on here in general who are optimists. Since I seem to be the only person under this article speaking the way I am, I am sorry, but I couldn&rsquo;t help but think you were directing them at me. And I didn&rsquo;t understand why.  All I have been doing is getting irritated with the same people you get irritated over.  I never said &#8220;we should ignore bad news&#8221; and I am getting tired of getting misunderstood with that.</p>
<p>As for the rest of my post, I was mostly directing that at the other posters, and not really at you.  I probably should have made that clear.</p>
<p>I like having you as a friend on here too.  And I should have made it more clear in my post who I was directing which points at.  I am just getting sick and tired of getting misunderstood and harrassed on points that I never even brought up.</p>
<p>I am not saying let&rsquo;s ignore bad news. I am not saying everything is wonderful. This is the last time I am explaining this.  I am just irritated with the same people you get irritated over. </p>

		<p>My husband and I love France and visited it 5x since 2001. Hovewer, we plan carefully to avoid any big city, concentrating on less travelled places or those that are preferred by the French tourists themselves. Alsace, Dordogne, Perigord, rural Bourgogne&hellip; Then we can have an illusion that nothing much has changed, at least until the moment we meet a group of schoolchildren on a trip. <br/>
Even in the country they are 30-50% black to brown.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when you get jolted back to reality   &mdash;   when you see a class of schoolchildren. Even in the country.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a white person but I am against miscegenation and interracial mixing of any kind. I am of the opinion that the European race has been able to build some of the greatest civilizations till date solely because of their racial characteristics. That been said, it does not mean that I have an inferiority complex of any kind. No, I do not. But I firmly believe white people have certain unique characteristics which have helped them prevail the hostile climates of Europe and emerge as a strong civilization. People from other parts of the world, especially Africa, do not have these characteristics and will ruin everything whites have built. Africa is and has been a failure and an evolutionary dead-end. Importing Africans into Europe and North America and worse yet, encouraging them to mongrelize the white populace will be detrimental to any kind of progress. </p>
<p>Again, I shouldn&rsquo;t be saying this as I&rsquo;m not a white person myself and some people here might even try to put me in the same catagory as other non-whites. However, I have respect for white people for what they have achieved and built. And the only way to keep that going is by protecting your unique identity. All Europeans : Icelanders, Finns, Swedes, Danes, Norwegians, Dutch, Germans, Swiss, English, Welsh, Irish, Scottish, French, Austrians, Poles, Russians, Slavs, Czechs, Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese and the Greek, and all others! Preserve your racial uniqueness. </p>
