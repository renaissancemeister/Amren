			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andy Barr, Politico, July 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced Wednesday night that he is considering introducing a constitutional amendment that would change existing law to no longer grant citizenship to the children of immigrants born in the United States.</p>
<p>Currently, the 14th Amendment grants citizenship to any child born in the United States.</p>
<p>But with 12 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S., Graham said it may be time to restrict the ability of immigrants to have children who become citizens just because they are born in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;I may introduce a constitutional amendment that changes the rules if you have a child here,&#8221; Graham said during an interview with Fox News&rsquo; Greta Van Susteren. &#8220;Birthright citizenship I think is a mistake.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We should change our Constitution and say if you come here illegally and you have a child, that child&rsquo;s automatically not a citizen.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;People come here to have babies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They come here to drop a child. It&rsquo;s called &#8216;drop and leave.&rsquo; To have a child in America, they cross the border, they go to the emergency room, have a child, and that child&rsquo;s automatically an American citizen. That shouldn&rsquo;t be the case. That attracts people here for all the wrong reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m a practical guy, but when you go forward, I don&rsquo;t want 20 million more 20 years from now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to be fair. I want to be humane. We need immigration policy, but it should be on our terms, not someone else&rsquo;s. I don&rsquo;t know how to fix it all. But I do know what makes people mad, that 12 million people came here, and there seems to be no system to deal with stopping 20 million 20 years from now.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This is really good news! I&rsquo;m glad that a mainstream politician, seen as a moderate Republican by most, is willing to tackle this issue head on.</p>
<p>I read somewhere that there&rsquo;s a special hotel in New York that handles pregnant women from Turkey who want to give birth in the U.S. so that the child is automatically a U.S. citizen. This is in addition, of course, to the myriads of illegals from Latin America who give birth here and can take advantage of the same loophole. </p>

		<p>Now this is exciting!   He is a typical liberal GOP, and now we get this extreme position?</p>
<p>Translation: 1) political consultants must have some data that foretells a vast conservative sea change is upon us, and moderate/liberal GOP politicians don&rsquo;t want to get left behind, so now they sound like true Americans, or 2) Graham went off his medz and is sounding like one of us.</p>
<p>With rhetoric about reinterpreting the 14th Amendment now possibly becoming commonplace, we are truly entering well trod territory in American history.</p>
<p>There are some issues that are so divisive that they never get resolved but through chaos.   This time, a majority of Whites in the North won&rsquo;t be fighting against Southern Whites.  </p>
<p>We have common enemies, and we will fight together.  The North has suffered enough from Emancipation without Deportation, and the illegal invasion, and the growing Islamofascist power grab.</p>
<p>Our soon arriving Day of Racial Reckoning will be ushered in by chaos, but will coalesce around racial realism and sanity. </p>
<p>White race traitors will be called out and thrown out.  First to go- lying Lindsay Graham.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought, that after the job lure, the anchor baby fianso is the next magnet that brings illegal aliens pouring across our borders. I don&rsquo;t think the misinterpreted 14th amendment will ever be used correctly because it would stop the birth of millions of future democratic voters and deny Americans the joy of living in a third world nation.</p>

		<p>Third Worlders will just switch to Canada, which has the same birth right citizenship.</p>
<p>Canada already has a problem with Arab and Asian birth tourism.  Doctors are threatening to withhold birth certificates because many of the foreign scammers leave without paying hospital bills.</p>
<p>The laws should have been tightened up 45 years ago, at the dawn of transcontinental airline travel.</p>

		<p>Lyndsey Graham sure is a Johnny-come-lately when it comes to backing sensible immigration reform. Earlier this year he was floating around the idea of pushing a bi-partisan amnesty with Chuck Schumer of NY a la McCain/Kennedy. This anchor baby scam needs to be terminated immediately, either through legislation or a constitutional amendment. Almost HALF of all babies being born now are non-white, and birthrate citizenship had no doubt a big role in this. If nothing is done soon, the US will no doubt be on the fast track to third-world status.</p>

		<p>@5 EPP,</p>
<p>Listen to the guy describe the &#8216;short cut way to re-re-interpreting the 14th amendment&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Congress can extend -further- citizenship rights to whomever it wants to, as a function of policy.</p>
<p>Which is to say that, having affirmed a requirement for acknowledgment of the 14th amendment (who knows how many would be grandfathered in), there could be open ended political quotas and perhaps even a backdoor Amnesty system set in place.</p>
<p>Which is what the next step in the lie: &#8216;temporary workers&rsquo; is going to be about.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ever think your government or the &#8216;public service broadcasts&rsquo; that they sponsor is actually working for you.  What has been done an is continuing to be so is a _crime_.  And that extends all the way up to the top of all three branches.</p>
<p>If all three branches of government are -so owned- by special interests and internal corruption that they can literally _work together_ to bypass an explicit Constitutional clause, then the only way to get a good, clean, bill through the legislature is to hold the ENTIRE government responsible for their ignoring of explicit law up to this time.</p>
<p>And if they won&rsquo;t do that, then any legislation they sign will be so cluttered with private agenda socialism and profiteering that it won&rsquo;t matter what it&rsquo;s express purpose is.</p>
<p>What this guy is really saying: Our government is the problem, not the Constitution.</p>

He is actually FOR ILLEGAL ALIEN invaders and their &#8220;path to citizenship&#8221; he voted to support the Obamaster and his Obamacare Ponzi scheme and in general has displayed his disdain for the wishes of his constituents in S.C.

		<p>Great News!! Of course, upper middle class people who show up just to have the baby are not a problem  &mdash;  Turks, Koreans, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, the children will pay taxes and have the same values as the rest of us. The problem is the mass of people the Democrats are trying to add to their constituents  &mdash;  8th grade dropouts from Mexico, here to drop children and earn enough for some status points back home. Their kids are VERY likely to become gangsters and convicts, their daughters to draw WIC, and we will pay pay pay for their failure to adjust. The smart thing is to keep them out. Why can&rsquo;t our politicians do the smart thing?</p>

		<p>As others have said, the &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; scheme is an abuse of the 14th amendment. But snake-oil salesmen have never been ones to say &#8220;no&#8221; to a quick buck. It derives from the inability of others to make a go of it in their own countries and the desire for those in the agriculture, construction, hospitality and meatpacking industries to wring extra profits out of tax payer subsidized indentured servants (aka illegals) while sticking tax payers with the bill (ie foodstamps, welfare, etc).</p>

		<p>In borrowing the scholarship of Edward J. Erler, professor of political science, California State University, let me explain that a constitutional amendment is not necessary for the U.S. to stop the anchor baby scam. There are two components to American citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment: 1) birth or naturalization in the U.S. and 2) being subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. In 1868, the phrase &ldquo;subject to the jurisdiction&rdquo; meant owing exclusive political allegiance to the U.S. &mdash; which is not the case with illegal aliens. Indeed, Senator Jacob Howard of Ohio, the author of the citizenship clause, assured senate colleagues that the new language was not intended to give birthright citizenship to &ldquo;persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, [or] who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Moreover, there is no Supreme Court decision squarely holding that children of illegal aliens are automatically citizens of the U.S. An 1898 decision, U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, held by a vote of 5-4 that a child of LEGAL resident aliens is entitled to birthright citizenship. Some constitutional scholars think that the Wong Kim Ark case went too far. But to say that children of illegal aliens are entitled to citizenship is entirely different because their parents are here without permission. Thus, repeal of the current &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; policy should not require a constitutional amendment. Many Republican representatives support HR 1868 which has been introduced to clarify the law. We need the Democrats also to step forward for a sane naturalization and immigration policy  &mdash;  or be voted out!<br>

		<p>Lindsey Graham is proposing this now for two reasons:</p>
<p>1) To appeal to voters that are fed up with illegal immigration, their anchor babies, and the RINO&rsquo;s that have aided and abetted them at the expense of White America.<br>
2) Because he KNOWS that a constitutional amendment to end &#8220;birthright citizenship&#8221; would never pass at this point.  Between Democrats, Neocons, and RINO&rsquo;s, true Conservatives are vastly outnumbered in Congress.</p>
<p>Lindsey Graham is simply playing election year politics, trying to appear Conservative at a time when RINO&rsquo;s have a huge target on their backs from Tea Partier&rsquo;s.  He&rsquo;s fooling nobody with this act.  Should Lindsey Graham be re-elected this November, his talk of a constitutional amendment will suddenly disappear and he will be right back to aiding and abetting the displacement of White America.</p>

		<p>Forgive my ignorance, but would somebody care to explain how abolishing birthright citizenship would work in practial terms? If a baby is born here and is not given citizenship due to his parents being illegal, and his parent&rsquo;s homeland is say, a wretched hellhole in perhaps Africa, and that homeland&rsquo;s government is unaware of his birth and thus does not give him citizenship, effectively making the child a citizen of nowhere, then what exactly do you do with him? </p>
<p>With our rampant influx of illegal immigrans would we eventually have large class of people with no citizenship to any nation? I know not all countries have birthright citizenship so what is the alternative? I genuinely would like to know what is the reasonable alternative you can argue to people on this point.</p>

Many women say giving birth in the US has benefits including cheaper education and fewer visa worries.&#8221; </p>

		<p>AJ #21, for my part I don&rsquo;t care WHO they belong to - let the parents sort it out. The issue is who they should NOT belong to- which is the U.S. Bottom line is if they have no legal connection to MY country, they should not to CITIZENS of my country. They can belong to the planet Vulcan for all I care. It seems to me that the huddled masses from every country on the planet are well schooled in what the U.S. offers and how to get it. They all seem to manage to make their way here, know where to get help and who to see to do it. They could just as easily school themeselves as about our laws if our laws were much stricter. Or simply enforced.</p>

		<p>The neoconservative movement in this country is toast.  People are tired of the wars spanning almost a decade, the globalism and free trade that have hollowed out our country&rsquo;s industries and the traitorous dealings with leftists to secure an amnesty for illegal aliens and other liberal pet projects.  It&rsquo;s not an election year for Graham so unless someone has some compromising hidden video footage of him in a park restroom, this is just a tactical move to sound more conservative.  These neocon politicians are sounding more Buchananesque just as the old right is preparing for a hostile takeover between now and 2012.  </p>

<p>#21 is very naive in assuming that all the countries of the world determine their citizenship by birth locale, as we do. In fact, most do not. Generally, the infant has the same citizenship that its parents have, regardless of where it is born. So there would be no problem with stateless babies. He can relax!</p>
<p>Additionally, one could point out that when there is no longer the benefit of automatic birth citizenship here,  many fewer pregnant women will be coming here and giving birth.</p>

<p>I agree but they still have the race card and it still works. I think that is all they need.</p>
<p>I think their race card can be &#8220;taken away&#8221; if we were to take on the Affirmative Action issue. But as far as I know nobody really is.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s ridiculous, the spell of racism has been broken thanks to 2 years of racist conduct by a black President.  I suspect the fear of being called racist was media manufactured in the first place.  I don&rsquo;t think like that and my family and friends don&rsquo;t either.  I think what you have here is a form of mind control where two parties, who are both in on it by the way, have one accuse the other of racism and the other capitulates on que and given sensationalist coverage by the media.  Wake up and smell the coffee. </p>

		<p>Thank you, Henry Clay, for pointing out that the fundamental authority of the 14th Amendment, as it exists, does NOT provide automatic citizenship to the offspring of the &#8220;uninvited.&#8221;  The  concern now is that part of what Dave says also is correct:  this is a stalemate by pols of both parties and every branch of  government, all of whom are interested only in protecting and retaining their own power, not in the best interests of the country or of the American citizenry.  We have only the polls to speak for us, but, even after our voices resoundingly are heard, we have no insurance that the pols will do what our mandate requires.  They pretend they don&rsquo;t know what a republic is &hellip;.</p>
<p>I appreciate your comments.</p>
