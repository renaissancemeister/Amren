<h1>New Black Panther Leader King Samir Shabazz: &#8220;You&rsquo;re Going to Have to Kill Some Crackers. You&rsquo;re Going to Have to Kill Their Babies.&#8221;</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<blockquote>
<i>King Samir Shabazz is the central figure in the New Black Panther Party voter-intimidation case (&#8220;Panthergate&#8221;). He it is who has agreed <a href="/news/2010/07/ex-official_acc.html" target="shabazz" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>&#8220;to not carry a &lsquo;deadly weapon&rsquo; near a polling place until 2012.&#8221;</b></a> The transcript which follows (which is not entirely accurate) comes from Part 2 of an on-line documentary. Parts 1 and 3 are may be accessed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x0dM7fR1WQ&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="parts1&amp;3" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here.</b></a></i>
</blockquote>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Transcript portion beginning around 2:57</p>
<p>Samir: My job is to educate black people, whether they want to be educated or not. I don&rsquo;t give a damn what they may think about white people, I hate white people. All of them. Every last iota of a cracker I hate him. Because we are still in this condition.</p>
<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;..&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Narrator: Samir will use any opportunity to shout his message. Even at a festival to celebrating African heritage.</p>
<p>Samir: We didn&rsquo;t come out here to play today. There is to much serious business going on in your black community to be sliding through south street with white, dirty cracker whores on your arms. What&rsquo;s a matter with you black man, you got a doomsday with a white woman on your arm.</p>
<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;..&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We keep begging white people for freedom. No wonder we&rsquo;re not free. Your enemy can not make you free fool. You want freedom you&rsquo;re going to have to kill some crackers. You&rsquo;re going to have to kill some of their babies.</p>
<p>Let us get our act together. It&rsquo;s time to wake up, clean up, and stand up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t wait for the day that they&rsquo;re all dead. I won&rsquo;t be completely happy until I see our people free and Whitey dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you have 10 brothers in uniform, suited and booted and ready for war, white folks know these niggas ain&rsquo;t their niggas. We kick white folks asses. We take it right to the cracker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re going to keep putting our foot up the white man&rsquo;s ass until they understand completely. We want freedom, justice and mutha[expletive]&rsquo; equality. Period. If you ain&rsquo;t gonna give it to us, mutha[expletive], we&rsquo;re gonna take it, in the name of freedom.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I would ask all these cartoonish black militants just one question; how am I &#8220;o-pressing&#8221; you when the only thing I want is to not have anything to do with you at all?</p>
<p>But yet&hellip;somehow I still deny them their freedom somehow.  I make a conscious choice to live as far from them as I can and still I am somehow keeping them down.</p>
<p>Their goes the &#8220;equality&#8221; of IQ argument.</p>
<p>Total apathy is what I have for the black identity crowd.  Nothing more and nothing less.</p>

<p>With a little refinement, and some more cracker-jack comments like these, with thanks to George Orwell, this guy could be an important part of any universities diversity program. Maybe he really wants to be a part of the justice department. He&rsquo;s playing on the wrong stage. </p>

		<p>Rush Limbaugh played this audio twice.  I can just imagine that that and that alone flipped 10 House seats this fall.</p>
<p>I only wish some of these conservative hosts would start thinking in a more Machiavellian fashion.  The Democrats/Media kept the Mark Foley non-story under the vest until a few weeks before the election in 2006, timing it to keep religious Republican types away from the polls (and it partially worked.)  Two can play at this game:  Our side should have kept this story under wraps until October.</p>
<p>About four years ago, something similar happened in St. Louis:</p>

		<p>Laughably (and with my tongue firmly in my cheek) I find a certain pity or even sympathy for King Samir Shabazz. At least he is honest; he hates &ldquo;whitey&rdquo; and wants him dead, not sitting in some hellish ghetto commune with him, discussing the &ldquo;finer points&rdquo; of Marxism, while they share a couple of Kools and a can of King Cobra.</p>
<p>That he candidly believes that, &ldquo;the black man is the king of this universe,&rdquo; does inspire my pity for this loony thug. That he refuses to accept a &ldquo;rainbow&rdquo; Marxism as the core for &ldquo;black power&rsquo;s&rdquo; germination and eventual harvests, enlists my minor sympathies. In the end, he will likely find only root rot and isolation as his reality, regardless of whatever questionable &ldquo;successes&rdquo; he &ldquo;enjoys,&rdquo; if their ever should be any, prior to his eventual incarceration or some other &ldquo;unexpected&rdquo; demise.</p>
<p>On a more serious note, it is interesting that the remaining original Black Panthers and fools like the SPLC&rsquo;s own Mark Potok, actually admit their Marxist inclinations so openly in this documentary. It is not that we didn&rsquo;t know that they were there, that is obvious; however, they normally try to cover (at least the SPLC crowd) them up as best they can.</p>
<p>Not hear Comrades, they are letting it all hang out, just like some out of control bleeding Red hemorrhoid!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!<br>

		<p>For a while the official Obama 2008 campaign site proudly listed the endorsement of the New Black Panthers.  The endorsement was removed when somebody with sense realized that it would create negative publicity worse than the rantings of Jeremiah Wright.  But with the failure to prosecute Samir Shabazz the Obama administration has shown where its loyalties truly lie.</p>
<p>There is only one issue on which I can agree with Mr. Shabazz   &mdash;   black men should keep their hands off of white women.  It takes a great deal of successful brainwashing to convince a pretty woman like this:</p>

		<p>&#8220;these cartoonish black militants&#8221;</p>
<p>Some comments of mine on the &#8220;NEW&#8221; Panthers and others of their ilk.</p>
<p>1. That too is exactly how I have always thought of the &#8220;black militant and the Black Panthers in particular.</p>
<p>Cartoonish. Glorified drum and bugle corps. Blacks just love drum and bugle corps. And Black Panthers, etc., are not much more than drum and bugle corps for adults.</p>
<p>The uniforms, the berets cocked to one side, the language, the deafening bullhorn, the marching in an exaggerated hip-hop manner, the sunglasses for anonymity, etc. </p>
<p>Cartoonish - - absolutely! Very pathetic!!</p>
<p>2. That language is NOT MERELY RHETORIC!!! That is EXACTLY WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO TO WHITEY IF THEY GET THE CHANCE. That fool of a boy &#8220;King&#8221; [blacks love the &#8220;fancy&#8221; titles too] would like to see all whites dead and in the proverbial heartbeat if he could. That is what is in their hearts and in their minds. They dare not try to do so, but if they could - - they would.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of confusion these PC times in which we find ourselves, about the word &#8220;Hatespeech.&#8221; What, we often ask ourselves, constitutes &#8220;Hatespeech&#8221; and what does not? The handy guide below gives examples of &#8220;Hatespeech&#8221; and &#8220;Not Hatespeech&#8221;, and should clear this matter up for anyone in doubt:</p>
<p><br>
* Mark Steyn reporting accurate statistics about Muslim demographics in a respected newsmagazine = Hatespeech</p>
<p>* New Black Panthers saying things like &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait for the day that they&rsquo;re all dead. I won&rsquo;t be completely happy until I see our people free and Whitey dead&rdquo; = Not Hatespeech</p>

		<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t have any clue how immediate a white order would be established to let them know how cunning we can be. We are a patient race, ruthless, when we had enough. And i would say that it is most likely on it&rsquo;s way, seeing how present events are evolving in this world. We have a well established shamless government body, where the minority is hiding underneath their skirts. we are about ready to rip their skirts off. don&rsquo;t let your natural lack of intelligence govern you no more Samir. I would greatly suggest you humble yourself and spread &#8220;that&#8221; around to your people. &#8220;H&#8221;.</p>

What does he have in common with Los Angeles&rsquo; previous four serial killers (ie, Chester Turner, Michael Hughes, Ivan J. Hill and John Floyd Thomas, Jr.)?  He&rsquo;s African-American.  What percentage do African-Americans represent of Los Angeles&rsquo; population?  About ten percent.</p>

		<p>The problem with this country today is the black&rsquo;s sense of entitlement.  We have built an entire generation of people who think that they are entitled to everything.  So, now every middle management position at our larger companies are staffed by &#8220;entitled&#8221; blacks who in most casses are grossly unqualified for the job they have.  This includes the President of the United States.  Barack Obama did not have any experience running anything, did not have to work with a budget, did not have to show results or be held accountable.  Everything that he does on a daily basis shows his inexperience.  </p>
<p>The country is due for a revolution.  The day is coming soon that everyone will have to work for what they get.  No one will be entitled to anything.  </p>

<p>Blacks are so susceptible to what they hear.  I know this will never be posted but I think that Shabazz needs to be whacked for the general welfare of the White population. If he&rsquo;s permitted to go on with these rants, eventually some psychotic Black <br>
( forgive the redundancy) will go and kill a White baby. Remember the little boy in Virginia who had his throat slashed by a Black while playing outside his home? And those thugs who invaded a home in Richmond and killed an entire White family; slitting the throats of two young children? They were the ones who were eventually arrested in W. Philly if I&rsquo;m not mistaken.<br>
No prosecution but public lynching for Don Imus.</p>

		<p>I saw this clip on O&rsquo;Reilly last night, and once I got over my shock, I made an observation:  the black passersby were just ignoring him and walking by, however, what offended me was the European Americans just calmly walking by, doing nothing.  It bothered me that you didn&rsquo;t see a group of European Americans surrounding him and screaming at him.  We need to stand together against such outward hate and racism against our people.  Well, I think all it takes is a few leaders to lead the &#8220;sheeple&#8221; into jumping on the bandwagon.</p>

		<p>Many of the liberal or otherwise deluded whites who voted for Obama probably just viewed &#8220;kill whitey&#8221; rantings as meaningless jibberish driven by racism and deprivation.  Now, the truth has got to be creeping up on them, if not slamming them in the face.  They thought half-white Obama was different, even though his wife appeared to be obviously bigoted and resentful of whites.  <br>
All we need to get rid of his man in 2012 is for  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ll say it again  &mdash;  white people to vote in large numbers!</p>

		<p>&#8220;There is only one issue on which I can agree with Mr. Shabazz  &mdash;  black men should keep their hands off of white women. It takes a great deal of successful brainwashing to convince a pretty woman like this:&#8221;</p>
<p>I hate to say it but that child has no resemblance to Heidi.<br>
Heidi, like so many White women WANT Blacks to keep their hands on them.<br>
I don&rsquo;t know what has become of our women. An acquaintance showed me a series of videos, probably downloaded from a Porn site, shot at several Bachelorette parties at different Club venues where there were nude male &#8220;dancers&#8221;; some of them Black. The dancers moved from table to table with this throbbing techno &#8220;music&#8221; populated by young mostly White women probably in their early twenties. As they arrived at each table many of the girls  took turns fellating them and in some cases to the point of ejaculation.  I think that they knew they were being recorded because they were smiling directly into the camera lens.<br>
I&rsquo;m not a total prude but I was disgusted at the sight of these young women degrading themselves to such a degree and their lack of concern regarding health issues. They seem to be totally unconcerned about these things being out on the Internet. This made &#8220;Girls Gone Wild&#8221; appear tame by comparison. </p>
<p>It brings back memories of a bumper sticker that I saw that read.&#8221;Jesus is coming soon and is HE PISSED!&#8221;</p>

<p>As a White woman myself, I could never ever bear a black mans child, let alone lie with him. Thank the feminist movement for demonizing the White male and emasculating him. The White male fell for it and became &#8220;more sensitive&#8221;. NON-white men did not.</p>
<p> Most women want a man who is strong and dominates whether they admit it or not. Remember when women fell for the &#8220;bad guy&#8221;? To some White women, White men have become wimpish in the last 40 years or so.</p>
<p> When &#8220;women&#8221; such as the one in the photo go with and bear a black mans child, it is more than brainwashing. These women have been indoctrinated from birth that there is no such thing as race and we are to &#8220;love everybody&#8221; and &#8220;we are all the same&#8221;. Not to mention the media idolizing of anything black and by paying them $$$$$ as sports stars and big stars in movies, music, etc. our enemy made it possible to also make them rich, which guarantees greedy women falling at their feet. </p>

Anyway, as the experience of the 1960&rsquo;s revealed, the FBI, love em or hate em, has the group penetrated, and all their emails and phone calls are wired by the NSC. Luckily for the country the intelligence operations in this country have autonomy from the POTUS since they are now centered in the Pentagon.<br>
These guys will all be dead or in prison before they hit 40.<br>

		<p>None of us should be surprised at the rantings and ravings of these militants.  The bottom line is that many blacks hate whites because deep down inside they realize that they&rsquo;re not as intelligent as we are, nor are they able to sustain any type of first world civilization and behaviour in any part of the world. The good news is that more whites are becoming aware of this reality.</p>

Oh, how I wish I could agree with you, but the fact is that the newer generations of whites are hardly cunning, and I&rsquo;m seriously doubting much of its intelligence. What you call patience is now actually laziness. Whites are now adopting the behavior we have allowed blacks to continue - in fact, promote - and today&rsquo;s young whites&rsquo; behavior is in no way representative of white behavior of old. It pains me that the truth is fewer and fewer whites are honest, responsible, mannerly, respectful and humble. It is whites who created the laws to enable this debacle of a society. <br>

		<p>The only thing surprising here is that this incident is getting any attention at all. I was in the military in the early 90s and heard stuff like this all the time from blacks. I was a liberal on race when I went in but 4 years later I was a white nationalist. </p>
<p>I no longer consider myself a white nationalist but I do want fairness and justice for white people. Maybe this fairly typical example of black racism will wake people up to the real hatred that exists out there.</p>

<p>California Feminists showed their priorities when they not only ignored the domestic abuse aspect of the O.J. Simpson trial, but censured those courageous feminists who protested the verdict.  Have white males been &ldquo;demonized&rdquo; by radical/gender feminism?  As an academic with thirty years experience, I believe that they have.  I am greatly appreciative of the doughty female posters to AR that have overcome the perpetual brainwashing and expert political indoctrination of our formerly great college educational system.</p>

		<p>Here is what I find interesting. When some white groups were in Nashville a few years ago to draw attention to the Christian/ Newsom murders and black on white crime, counter-protesters, both black and white, were across the street screaming and mocking the pro-white groups. And yet in this video there is no reaction from the people on the street, not black or white. No screaming or mocking the black panthers by anyone. There is a double standard here and are whites to blame for their apathy?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m proud that whites as well as blacks walked right on by these two.  We are not as naturally developed or as instantaneously able to shift from verbal to physical aggression as blacks.  It would take at least four average middle class white urbanites to be sure on either one of them and if both lashed out with that stick on their side, it would be equal odds.</p>
<p>Which would make it seem like the whites got what they deserved on the very next TV broadcast.  Dragging us down to their level.</p>
<p>We need to stay concentrated and effective, on point, with the economic realities that we are being presented by everyone from the CRS to the group that just did the -113 billion dollar loss statistics report.</p>
<p>Blacks form about 11-12% of our nation.  Between their own self destructive behavior amongst themselves and our incarceration of two entire generations of their criminals, keeping fathers from teaching sons any wisdom and thus further debilitating their family base, we are running an effective population control regime on them.</p>
<p>Not so the Hispanics who are far more insular and hard headed about what they want and what they will make themselves do to get it.</p>
<p>Which is sad to me.  Because I have some really good friends among the (legal citizens) of this country who are from Peru, Mexico and even Brazil.  They came here anything up to 50 year ago and some have grandkids now.  Decent people, religious, civically responsible, hard working and charitable if you break past that extremely tough outer shell.</p>
<p>If their social roles with blacks were reversed, this nation would be a LOT further down the road to &#8216;assimilation&rsquo;.  We would also have no problems whatsoever slamming closed our borders on the ravening predators that would now be coming across it.</p>
<p>But these roles are not reversed.</p>
<p>And so, by numbers alone, we need to stay focssed on the threat group which has the most potential to ethnically unhinge our nation.</p>
<p>Keep your politics clean people.  We can&rsquo;t afford to let November become racialized.  That would only enable the Democrats to split our voting demographic again.</p>

		<p>Stop talking theory and start taking this Shabazz seriously.  He may be a clown but he&rsquo;s a KILLER CLOWN but not from outer space. He&rsquo;s right here in OUR space and he means what he says and says what he means. Remember the home invasion where a White family of four were all murdered.  The two small children had their throats slit. There was also the young White boy who had his throat slit by a Black who ranted about killing White people, Remember the so called Professor Kambon who called for the extermination of White people from the earth.  There is and has been an incremental genocide being waged on innocent White people for the last 40 years in this country but it appears that we haven&rsquo;t figured it out as yet. Every unprovoked attack upon White people is driven by racial hatred and it appears that we have an AG and perhaps even a POTUS who share this sentiment and have given it their approval by virtue of the DOJ&rsquo;s disinterest in prosecuting hate crimes when the victims are White.  </p>
<p>Remember what Bebe Netanyahu said about people who constantly express their desire to kill you. Blacks are very susceptible to suggestion especially if it relates to violence. Murder and rape hold an attraction for them and it carries all the way back to their homeland where it flourishes today. They aren&rsquo;t like us and they never will be. We want to eliminate our criminal element and incarcerate them. BLacks admire those among them who prey upon Whites. The only alternative to armed racial conflict is voluntary separation.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to keep putting our foot up the white man&rsquo;s ass until they understand completely. We want freedom, justice and mutha[expletive]&rsquo; equality. Period. If you ain&rsquo;t gonna give it to us, mutha[expletive], we&rsquo;re gonna take it, in the name of freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What really saddens me is that all blacks feel this way, but, like all brown mouths they&rsquo;re just too cowardly to do anything about it.  They just don&rsquo;t have the courage to do anything other than rant and rave and hope whitey gives them something for nothing, because they&rsquo;re just too dim witted to advance themselves.</p>
<p>This Shabazz is the cowardliest of them all and would probably faint if anybody started towards him to confront him head to head.  He screams and raves hysterically, trying to incite other blacks to skew up their well-known lack of courage and take action, because he&rsquo;s too frightenbed to do anything but yell out incitements.</p>
<p>The black male situation can be summed up very briefly:  Most of them have such low I.Q.&rsquo;s they can&rsquo;t learn anything more complicated than janitorial work; they don&rsquo;t have any drive, determination or creativity to pursue their own businesses (Note that all stores in their areas are owned by other non-whites, never blacks.); they turn to things easy to understand, like stealing, selling dope, and other crime; now this Shabazz is showing us that, as in Korea, they have so many instances of turning and fleeing because of a lack of courage they don&rsquo;t even follow through in any way with all their radical threats. </p>
<p>So, bottom line is that I don&rsquo;t really think we have anything to worry about them except for having to continue to provide for them like small children, because they can&rsquo;t provide for themselves.</p>

<p>The most obnoxious thing about that expletive-filled rant of his is that he views freedom, justice and equality as physical commodities like chrome spinners, bling and X boxes.  Little does the dullard realize that you must earn those abstract virtues, and the quickest way to have it denied to you is inserting your foot into the orifices of other people.</p>
<p>The typical AmRener wants freedom and justice, but instead of &#8220;kicking people&rsquo;s asses,&#8221; they study history, civics, philosophy, various social sciences or other fields, and engage in the form of self-restraint and altruism necessary to a society where freedom and justice can flourish.  The average American wants freedom and justice, too, but they, unlike the average AmRenner, isn&rsquo;t blessed with that kind of brain power, so they partake of the education system to the degree they can, then pursue relatively mundane careers, all the while acting like normal, civilized people.  Allen West, who is as black as this King Shabazz creep, and mentioned in today&rsquo;s AR news items, wanted freedom and justice just as much, but instead of kicking the white man&rsquo;s ass, joined the white man&rsquo;s Marine Corps, and (albeit with the help of affirmative action, for sure) rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and is now parlaying that into a run for Congress, where, unlike Shabazz, he would have 1/435th of the power of the lower house of the legislative branch of the Federal government, i.e. real power to earn real freedom and justice.  (Although he&rsquo;s somewhat too neo-conish for my tastes, and I don&rsquo;t like the notion that we need permission from any non-white to be for our own people or our own chosen ideology.)</p>

<p>Good points, QD, but with all due respect I don&rsquo;t want a single black in office anywhere.  If this one mouths conservative principles I truly believe he&rsquo;s lying and would be no different than any other black who would put his race over anything else if he were confronted with a decision.

<p>As always, follow the money.  I have no doubt as to the sincerity of this idiot&rsquo;s ranting and raving and all Whites should heed this message as to what blacks have planned for us if (or when) given the chance  &mdash;  but the more important lesson is this:  that the current regime will not only not prosecute threats of extreme violence if they&rsquo;re directed at Whites (such as killing our babies), It Condones Them.</p>
<p>Blacks are primed  from birth by the media and academia to not only despise Whites but to believe that they&rsquo;ll only be out from under White Suppression/Oppression if Whites are eliminated:  &#8220;You want freedom you&rsquo;re going to have to kill some crackers. You&rsquo;re going to have to kill some of their babies.&#8221;</p>
<p>What blacks don&rsquo;t realize due to their low group intelligence is that they&rsquo;re playing the role of useful idiots, completely expendable, doing the bidding of their new masters:  A Hostile Elite that funds anti-white organizations (ACLU, SPLC), forms, funds and organizes black organizations (NAACP), incites and excuses black violence and terror against Whites, continues to push legislation to suppress Whites and encourages massive non-White colonization and White displacement.</p>
<p>Ultimately, The Hostile Elite only looks out for its own; blacks have no place in the NWO they&rsquo;re re-creating in the US for themselves. </p>

<p><em>We keep begging white people for freedom. No wonder we&rsquo;re not free. </em></p>
<p>Freedom is something you have to earn; you can&rsquo;t continue squatting in countries you have no place being in and expect it to be handed to you on a plate.</p>
<p><em>You want freedom you&rsquo;re going to have to kill some crackers. You&rsquo;re going to have to kill some of their babies.</em></p>
<p>If We highlighted the essential truths about our own survival in the face of the rising tide, we would have the thought police banging on our doors. Of course, you can express your uniquely enriching culturally diverse perspectives, and it will be regarded as advanced university learning that must be embraced by all self-regarding double-plus-goodthinkers.</p>
<p><em>I can&rsquo;t wait for the day that they&rsquo;re all dead. I won&rsquo;t be completely happy until I see our people free and Whitey dead</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to be a fly on the wall; to see an unbridled appetite for the consumption of the products of the ingenuity and creativity of other races utterly thwarted by the vengeful instincts that led to the ultimate in &#8216;biting that hand that feeds&rsquo;. We might lose it all, but your lot could never rebuild it.</p>
<p><em>We&rsquo;re going to keep putting our foot up the white man&rsquo;s ass until they understand completely. We want freedom, justice and mutha[expletive]&rsquo; equality. Period.

<p>Give or take 100K + years of evolution, not to mention the prevalence of psychosis and other personality disorders manifestly exhibited by those who have no legitimate reason for insisting on squatting on a civilisation that had no part in creating.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to thank King(ky) Samar ShaSpazz for lacking the restraint to express what blacks generally feel about White People, whilst being so utterly arrogant and complacent as to notice that no arraignments for double-minusful-wrongspeak could ever possibly accrue to him.</p>
<p>If I expressed my view generally that there is no room for the African phenotype in my Civilised society, the thought police would send me to a place of detention in which it could be assured I would lose if not my life, then at least my virtue as a red blooded male (this could be part of the overall design).</p>

None of this is about equality, it&rsquo;s about who has power over another, and that is determined by race in too many people&rsquo;s minds. Power is really about who has the money. Race is a cloud used to confuse others. Wake up people! you are being used while the real enemy steals your birthrights.</p>
