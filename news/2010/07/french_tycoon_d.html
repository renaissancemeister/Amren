<h1><a href="http://www.bvonmoney.com/2010/07/19/french-tycoon-defends-muslim-women-who-will-wear-niqab-who-will/">French Tycoon Defends Muslim Women Who Wear Niqab</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elliot Millner, Black Voices, July 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A French businessman has recently made news by pledging to financially defend the right of Muslim women in France to wear the niqab, a garment worn to cover the majority of the face.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news of approval of the veil ban in the lower house of the French parliament, which opened the door for it to be ratified into law in September, Rachid Nekkaz decided to do something to combat it. A French citizen and Muslim of Algerian descent, Nekkaz declared that he would set aside a fund of $1 million euros to bail out and defend any Muslim woman charged under the new law. {snip}</p>
<p>For the record, this law serves no legitimate purpose and is a thinly &#8220;veiled&#8221; racist and xenophobic attack on the French Muslim population, fueled by anti-Muslim paranoia. The irony is that only a small percentage of French Muslim women  &mdash;  approximately 2,000 out of 5 million Muslims in France  &mdash;  wear the veil. {snip} Given how liberal France generally is regarding what individuals are allowed to wear (or not wear), this ban is completely hypocritical.</p>
<p>Putting the absurdity of the law itself aside, Nekkaz must be applauded for his activism in defending what he sees as the right of Muslim women to dress in whatever way they choose  &mdash;  as other French citizens are allowed to do. {snip}</p>
<p>Can you imagine the positive impact that could be made here in the United States by black people with the financial means (and public profile) to do things similar to what Nekkaz has done? Although there are certain individuals who may be contributing financially to causes who we simply don&rsquo;t hear about, the reality is that sometimes it isn&rsquo;t just about the money being given; it is about the willingness to publicly take a stand for something  &mdash;  to be willing to actually sacrifice money, time and possibly public acceptance for a cause larger than yourself. The social capital of our most prominent African Americans is vast and has yet to be tapped for our most important causes.</p>
<p>The anti-Muslim backlash being experienced by Muslims in France shares many similarities to the anti-Obama, anti-black backlash here in the United States. Will any famous or wealthy black people step up in the same manner as Nekkaz,? Or will our African American elite simply focus on &#8220;getting theirs&#8221; while the masses continue to struggle? Blacks of means in America have something to learn from Nekkaz about how to influence politics through business.<br/>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t &#8220;blacks of means&#8221; use their money to create a model country in Africa instead?</p>
<p>Why not Arabs, with all their oil money, create a model justice system in the Arab cresent?</p>
<p>No, they only suggest forcing the white Western countries to adapt to them and look after them. </p>

		<p>Reading this article, one would assume that Rekkaz was black.</p>
<p>Not even close.</p>

<p>However White he looks, though, what he is doing is against the interests of the real French.</p>
<p>It is not right that the West, or any part of Europe, be conquered by him with the most money, but it seems that money does indeed talk.<br/>

<p>Islam is a race now?  I thought it was a religion.</p>

<p>Various postings to this forum, including a number by myself, have made this specific point. A bank, a pool of money, funded by all these wealthy black athletes and entertainers and celebrities, use to finance all sorts of good works that benefit blacks.</p>
<p>Oprah, Michael Jordan, Bill Cosby, Tiger, what is his name the singer that passed a way just about a year ago, etc.</p>
<p>All these folks and others should be able to put into the fund a cool $billion or so per year each and every year. That is a lot of scholarships, businesses, homes, rehab programs, legal defense funds, etc.</p>
<p>Why not INDEED!!</p>

		<p>For this writer&rsquo;s information, the wealthy Bantu elite in the United States are indeed focused on &#8220;getting theirs&#8221;; and have been for decades now. They expect whitey to take care of the Bantu masses in the inner city, through taxation and legislation.</p>
<p>Why should the elite Bantus in this country wring their hands over Haiti, Darfur or Compton, when they have the likes of Angelina Jolie, Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon doing it for them?</p>
<p>I never heard of Don King, the Williams sisters, Ludacris or Hallle Berry establish any foundations or funds to help out the inner city Bantus. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how he made his money, but I know he&rsquo;s running for president of France.  Everyone should view that video given us by #2. This is a very good example of a polished, suave, assimilated North African Arab who could very easily be mistaken for a Frenchman. It gets confusing.  Not all Arabs look like, well, &#8220;Arabs&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The French have a history of surrender and collaborating with the enemy.  </p>
<p>However, in the past the enemy was white; whereas today the enemy consists of primitive blacks and medieval Muslims.   </p>
<p>The men of France have the opportunity to redeem their dignity and courage by routing these hostile alien degenerates if it is within themselves to do soâ€¦ </p>
