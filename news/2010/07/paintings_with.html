<h1>Paintings with Pigs Removed from Hospitals</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>NIS News Bulletin (Netherlands), July 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three paintings depicting pigs have been pre-emptively removed from a hospital in Leerdam because they might offend Muslims.</p>
<p>One patient, not actually himself a Muslim, made a complaint about the paintings because he wanted to avoid Muslims having confrontations with the pigs. The leadership of the healthcare institution, the Linge Polyclinic, thereupon decided to remove the paintings immediately, Algemeen Dagblad newspaper reports.</p>
<p>The artist, Sylvia Bosch, is astounded. &#8220;One week earlier, I had an e-mail from the clinic saying that they were getting nice reactions. After a single complaint, they had to be taken away immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Linge Polyclinic has stated that the pictures were removed because &#8220;all visitors must feel comfortable in the institution&#8221;.<br>

		<p>What if I&rsquo;m offended by the sight of a Muslim in a hospital or anywhere else??  Are they gonna immediately remove the Muslim because I equate him/her with the pig that the Muslim defender found offensive?</p>

		<p>ANON 1, One can never tell what will, at any given time, &#8220;offend&#8221; or &#8220;outrage&#8221; a muslim or a black, it depends entirely on the possibility of winning the ghetto lottery. Things that have no effect on muslims in their own countries (because they can&rsquo;t sue anyone) will cause &#8220;outrage&#8221; in Western countries because blacks and muslims (often one and the same)KNOW they can get free stuff by being &#8220;outraged&#8221;!!!</p>

		<p>This is utterly asinine as &#8220;Anonymous #1&#8221; Indicated above. I actually know people of Muslim backgrounds and they are NOT  offended by representations of swine! Talk about Political Correctness taken to its ludicrous extremes! My God, we must be the most mentally defective generations of humans ever to have walked the earth!!    </p>

		<p>The hospital should replace the pig paintings with nude paintings by Titian or Rembrandt. Let&rsquo;s see how Muslims react to that.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe that followers of a sane religion would be offended by the sight, or a depiction, of one of God&rsquo;s (Allah&rsquo;s) creations.</p>

		<p>Another example of non-white people changing white society into their own image.  Every white person needs to get it through their heads that you are NOT going to turn non-white people into white people by physically locating them near white people or by any other means.  They are non-white and will always be non-white whether they are in China or Ireland.</p>

		<p>It isn&rsquo;t so much that Muslims are offended at the sight of pigs.  Muslims are simply offended at the idea of khufr enjoying something  - anything. After all, &#8220;there is no fun in Islam&#8221; (the Ayatollah Khomeni said that) &hellip; and certainly, khufr, as lowest-class citizens, ranking below the Mufti&rsquo;s camel, aren&rsquo;t to have fun or enjoy pictures of Babe the Pig.</p>

		<p>They are just seeing how far they can go. Of course they&rsquo;re having success with complaining, so therefore don&rsquo;t be surprised if they push the envelope a little further   &mdash;   then a little further and so forth.</p>
<p>Best way to stop this sillyness is to ignore these silly complaints. That&rsquo;s all.</p>

		<p>[The paintings]  &#8220;have been <b>pre-emptively removed </b> from a hospital in Leerdam because <b>they might </b> offend Muslims.<br>
One patient, <b>not actually himself a Muslim,  </b>made a complaint&hellip;&#8221; <br>
_____________</p>
<p>Note that this complaint wasn&rsquo;t even made by any Muslim!</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful that the Dutch are so solicitous about their precious Muslims that they don&rsquo;t even wait for the Muslims to be &#8220;offended&#8221;?  They anticipate their dear Muslims&rsquo; feelings and take action IN ADVANCE to prevent any slightest offense to Muslim sensitivity!   Could they possibly bend over backwards any farther to be accommodating?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say it, but for people as far-gone as that, there is no hope. Some whites are sick beyond cure.</p>
<p>The Dutch nation is on its deathbed, and some (of their own) can&rsquo;t hurry the final moment fast enough.<br>

		<p>Although the Dutch are probably worse, American society has become so cringingly terrified of offending a few that it goes to absurd lengths to prevent any possibility.  I live in the Bible Belt, and yet over 20 years ago my daughter&rsquo;s high school forbade students, identifying as a school-sponsored club, from singing any religious-themed song as they went caroling.  <br>
As for the hospital in the article, such knee-jerk behavior doesn&rsquo;t surprise me a bit.  I worked in health care for over 30 years and saw it go from a patient-oriented system to a customer-oriented one.  Every complaint or accusation, no matter how ridiculous, had to be acted upon.  If, for instance, one patient (customer) said it was too cold, the heat was turned up.  If another said it was too hot, the heat was turned back down.  No discussion or no statement of policy was even attempted.  I know without doubt that any complaint about a picture would have seen it hurriedly taken down.  The customer wouldn&rsquo;t even have to have a reason.</p>

		<p>One day there will be a story coming out of the UK that in order to not &#8220;offend&#8221; the Muslims all women working in that particular facility (school, hospital or other public building) will have to adopt Islamic dress. They just keep pushing and pushing the boundary. I am not surprised that it was a non-Muslim that complained about the picture, notice what happens when Muslims get offended. </p>

		<p>Anthing that makes Muslims feel &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; is good and should be perpetuated.  Maybe if they all begin to feel that way, they&rsquo;ll begin to leaving.</p>

		<p>I remember having read a newspaper article some time back in which it was claimed that blacks felt alienated in white medical professionals&rsquo; waiting rooms because they often displayed pictures of events like fox hunting parties in England, with which the local AA population obviously didn&rsquo;t identify. Of course, the solution was to replace the paintings with others which more accurately reflected the diversity of the community, although just what those might have been, I don&rsquo;t recall.</p>

		<p>I remember reading about a black computer tech employed by the Dallas school system filing a lawsuit against drive manufacturers, because when you have two drives connected to the same data cable one is designated &#8220;Master&#8221; and the other &#8220;Slave&#8221;.</p>
<p>Blacks living in black African countries do not obsess over race, because they are the majority and surrounded by their own kind.</p>
<p>However, black Africans living in white countries are surrounded by a race that is more intelligent, more attractive, and more accomplished.</p>
<p>Blacks are aware of this every time they see a white and the black&rsquo;s feeling of inferiority fills them with self-loathing.</p>
<p>This self-loathing creates racial jealousy which in turn causes them to hate whites with a passion.</p>
<p>Nature will no more allow blacks to live peacefully with whites (or any other race) than it will allow cobras and mongooses become friends&hellip;</p>
