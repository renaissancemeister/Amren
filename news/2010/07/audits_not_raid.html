<h1>Audits, Not Raids Mark U.S. Immigration Crackdown: Report</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, July 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The [New York] Times said the Obama administration had conducted such audits at more than 2,900 companies so far  &mdash;  a number it said dwarfed the number of companies affected by the immigration raids at factories and farms during the eight-year administration of Obama&rsquo;s Republican predecessor, George W. Bush.</p>
<p>The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, known as ICE, has imposed $3 million in fines on businesses found to be in violation.</p>
<p>The Times said the government forces the businesses to fire every suspected illegal immigrant discovered on their payrolls {snip}.</p>
<p>But the Times said most of the workers discovered by the audits were not being deported once they lost their jobs and that the government had moved away from the practice of bringing criminal charges against immigrants who lack legal status but have otherwise clean records.</p>
<p>ICE chief John Morton told the Times, said the purpose of the audits was to create &#8220;a culture of compliance&#8221; in which employers would routinely verify the immigration status of their workers. He said ICE was most interested in finding &#8220;egregious employers.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Which is more effective, the rare prosecution that costs millions of dollars to get some scapegoat a couple of years in prison, or lawsuits that bankrupt the company and put tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars into the pocket of either government or class action plaintiffs who bring suit?</p>
<p>Decades of threat of criminal prosecution have been ineffective, mostly because criminal prosecution rarely brought anything approaching real consequences to anyone who was really to blame.  But torts?  That will quickly wipe out any who dare engage in this practice.  Those who would fill the country with non-whites will be up at night, quavering in fear that they will become instant paupers&hellip;.forced to live in the ghettos they created.</p>

		<p>If that&rsquo;s the only extent to which immigration law is going to be enforced, then I&rsquo;m fine with it.  However, the Obamaites want illegal aliens to get welfare, and sub rosa, vote, so it by itself is not enough, considering the current WH occupant. </p>
<p>If you create a climate in which there is no reward to illegal immigration and nothing an illegal alien can gain by being here illegally, most will self-deport and many more won&rsquo;t try to sneak in at all.  That was the lesson learned with President Eisenhower&rsquo;s Operation W. in the 1950s.</p>

		<p>Illegals are employed by hispanic umbrella groups<br>
who run companies and hide all employment records.<br>
These companies are run along the  Jefe/Peon system<br>
of intimidation that illegals know so well from Mexico. The illegals are paid below minimum wage and are housed 5 to a room<br>
in houses rented by the company which confiscates their <br>
wages. Often these companies and houses make their real<br>
money as drug distribution centers..with <br>
illegals acting as couriers. This is why mere fining<br>
white employers will never get rid of the problem. But more<br>
to Obamas purpose..bringing whites into the center of the problem<br>
allows Obama to argue for amnesty..and the destruction of<br>
white demographics, which is what he really wants.</p>

		<p>LIES, nothing but lies do we get from the MSM!  Bush, Congress and OBAMA did NOTHING about illegals! Even when the Republicans had the majority in Congress and a Republican POTUS they did NOTHING!</p>

		<p>Q: If the government doesn&rsquo;t want employers to hire them, then why does it let them in?</p>
<p>A: It lets them in because they vote for the Democratic Party and because it allows the government to take in more revenue by fining employers.</p>
<p>p.s. Speaking of Operation &#8220;W&#8221;, Rush Limbaugh mentioned it on his show, but couldn&rsquo;t say its name. For more, go to:<br>

		<p>The fact that Obama is enforcing immigration laws at employment sites with more enthusiasm than Bush is a classic case of &#8220;how low the valley&#8221; rather than &#8220;how high the mountain.&#8221;  It says little about good Obama is; it says much about how bad Bush was.  </p>

		<p>It APPEARS as if the community organizer is being more effective than Bush, but since the information came from the New York Times, the biggest coterie of liars in the field of journalism, I refuse to believe any of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 99% certain that a check into the matter would reveal that there are very few employers being pressed for having illegals on the payroll.</p>
<p>The NYT, the L.A. Times, and almost every other newspaper in the country, are leftist rags full of lies that print anything they believe will help the left wing radicals in this country and especially the community organizer.  None of them can be believed.</p>
<p>Biased reporting has always been a bit of a problem among the papers, but today it is so rampant these yellow journalistic rags are to Obama what Pravda was to the Kremlin.</p>
