<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jul/11/gchq-ethnic-minority-report">Too Few Ethnic-Minority Staff at GCHQ, Claims Whitehall Report</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Owen Bowcott, Guardian (London), July 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A shortage of ethnic-minority staff with key language skills is hampering the intelligence services&rsquo; ability to eavesdrop on terrorist conversations, according to a leaked Whitehall report.</p>
<p>The study, produced by a Whitehall race adviser, warns that black and Asian officers working at the Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham feel they are the subject of racial discrimination within the 5,500-strong organisation.</p>
<p>The 28-page report, The Representation of Black and Minority Ethnic People, was commissioned last year after concerns raised in a public document, GCHQ&rsquo;s Capability Review. The inquiry was authorised by the head of the civil service, Sir Gus O&rsquo;Donnell.</p>
<p>Most of the agency&rsquo;s work involves intercepting telephone calls and emails between terrorist suspects for MI5, and MI6 and a lack of officers with specialist knowledge of languages, such as Arabic or Urdu, was said to be a problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. critical to have a diverse staff group who are able to profile and recognise certain behaviour patterns and communications,&#8221; the report says. &#8220;There is a very small pool of black and minority ethnic employees within the total workforce .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. specific concerns have been raised by both management and staff around the language team. This area of work is unusually diverse within the organisation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The policy of local community recruitment should be expanded from Cheltenham to areas such as Birmingham &#8220;which has more visible diversity&#8221;, the report recommends. Equality and diversity should be &#8220;embedded&#8221; in recruitment practice because .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8220;this is critical to good national security intelligence and is also a form of future proofing by preparing the organisation to be receptive to more diverse staff.&#8221;</p>
<p>By September last year, the percentage of black and ethnic minority employees stood at only 2.49% of the workforce. The report records some GCHQ officers&rsquo; experiences of discrimination:</p>
<p>* &#8220;I wasn&rsquo;t born here and although I have been security cleared, I am constantly challenged about my loyalty to Britain by my colleagues.&#8221;</p>
<p>* &#8220;The security officers ask questions which are culturally inappropriate, insensitive and offensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>* &#8220;As black and minority ethnic employees, we have to work harder than our white counterparts and for less reward.&#8221;</p>
<p>MI5 was the first intelligence service to recognise the importance of recruiting ethnic minority officers who might be able to penetrate terrorist networks. MI6 has followed suit.</p>
<p>Responding to the report, leaked to the Sunday Times, a GCHQ press officer said the recruitment freeze complicated attempts to increase ethnic diversity. &#8220;Our capability review in June 2009 reflected that GCHQ continued to fall short in meeting our targets,&#8221; he said. &#8220;GCHQ&rsquo;s board commissioned a review to assist in supporting our commitment to increasing the numbers of black and minority ethnic staff, their progression and contribution.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are making a number of improvements to our policies and practices, including: a dedicated diversity officer; relaunch of our black and minority ethnic network with a target to increase membership; co-ordinated community engagement with diverse schools and community projects; review of university diversity data to help us identify universities to target; and internal awareness raising such as diversity week.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>Whenever the blacks come and demand we hire more &#8220;people of color,&#8221; we must ask them for a list of our White employees whom they want us to fire and in what order they want the firing to occur.</p>
<p>Put them on the spot and make them explain why Whites can&rsquo;t do the job that their blacks supposedly can.</p>
<p>Force them to admit that they hate Whitey.</p>

		<p>Another hidden cost of diversity.</p>
<p>It is difficult to confidently share national secrets or investigative intelligence with people who may have blood loyalty to adversaries.</p>
<p>Much extra expenditure has to be made to groom, assess, recruit, and watch over an alien national.</p>

<i>* &ldquo;The security officers ask questions which are culturally inappropriate, insensitive and offensive.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about the security of a nation. Ones own comfort level shouldn&rsquo;t come before national security. If you can&rsquo;t handle the questions, stay out of the service.</p>
<p><i>* &ldquo;As black and minority ethnic employees, we have to work harder than our white counterparts and for less reward.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>I always say black behavior is universal. &#8220;We have to work harder&#8221;. I hear blacks say the same thing in the US. One would think that they would extricate themselves and form their superior nations by working half as hard as whites.</p>

		<p> And just think - If they didn&rsquo;t let them in to begin with, ALL of this could be avoided. I wonder how much time and money Africa, Asia and the Middle East spend on &#8220;diversity&#8221;! </p>

		<p>Britain is for the British.  The British made Britain.  It&rsquo;s incredibly disrepectful of foreigners to come in to take advantage of everything the British made and want things changed.  These foreigners should change their own societies instead of wanting to change others.</p>

		<p>This is how Europe was lost.  They hired only Arabic speakers because they was where the masses of electoral cattle were being imported from to keep Socialists in power.  Before long the immigration services were all staffed by American hating Muslim foreigners and voila!  Complete demographic replacement.  We will be at war again with Europe soon so get over it now and stop treating them like our allies.  It is America alone already.  </p>

		<p>If only the British marxists understood that if they never had contact with world-eating, life-smothering third worlders, they wouldn&rsquo;t need to invite the same into their midst, to help fight same.<br/>
Brits are frothing at the mouth-mad. Just like the rest of the leftist white world. And frankly, the utter collapse of the west is no surprise, and really not even a shame.<br/>
When a society goes mad, why should it be saved? build a new one from the rubble. After the Marxists pull the walls of their prisons down upon themselves, and crush themselves, sane whites will walk out and form new nations, which for a time, will again be healthy and sane.</p>

		<p>Didn&rsquo;t all once White societies fall for multicult madness?  Why? Traitors have always been among us. The few ruled over the masses and I believe most(the masses) are weak willed to begin with.</p>
<p> Just look at most Whites in Europe and the USA. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if they are liberal or conservative. They are easily indoctrinated and emotionally like little children. That is one of the worst flaws the White race is guilty of. I don&rsquo;t trust most Whites I see and could never discuss racial realities with any of them. They would turn off and just label me a hater, a bigot, a racist. That is how far gone our race has become.</p>

		<p>If they can dictate who is employed in the Royal Staff, their next attack will be on the Royals themselves, and it will be based on the lack of non-white spouses of the famliy itself as well as other noble houses.</p>
<p>They will go on relentlessly, taking over step by step, unless they are stopped cold.  I hope the Queen and the Prince of Wales will realize this (I think they do alreaedy) and begin to reverse the damage done by the Labour Party.</p>

		<p>The apparent &#8216;need&rsquo; to recruit those who can decipher the email and telephone conversations of our potential adversaries could easily be managed by simply not allowing them in to Europe in the first instance.</p>
<p>From my own personal experience in the world of public sector employment, I can assure you that it is not a case of blacks having to work harder than White for less reward; rather it is strikingly the reverse.<br/>

		<p><i>* &ldquo;As black and minority ethnic employees, we have to work harder than our white counterparts and for less reward.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing with blacks here, they always complain about how they have to work &#8220;twice as hard&#8221; or some numerical multiple in order to get &#8220;the same&#8221; rewards or &#8220;not as much.&#8221;  Or, a variant is that they complain their &#8220;last hired first fired.&#8221;  Of course, that&rsquo;s the hardest work those types ever do, that is, complain about how much harder than whites they have to work.</p>
<p>I overheard one said that &#8220;da bwack man&rsquo;s gotz to have six degrees from college like in order to get da same job that a white cracka wiff&rsquo; only one getz.&#8221;  He (and by &#8220;he,&#8221; I mean a 40-something year old), said that as someone who was &#8220;on my way to the GED class my PO&rsquo;s making me do.&#8221;</p>
