<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio says he has &#8220;deep concerns&#8221; that people in the country illegally have &#8220;managed to gain access onto an active U.S. military installation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arpaio&rsquo;s detectives raided Phoenix-based cleaning company Valley View Building Services Tuesday in search of 25 employees suspected of identity theft and fraud. At least one of the suspects had worked at Fort Huachuca, an Army post 15 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border that serves as the largest military intelligence-training center in the country.</p>
<p>Five women were detained, four were suspected of being in the country illegally; the fifth is a U.S. citizen with an outstanding warrant. Authorities are still searching for other illegal immigrants said to be working for the company  &mdash;  particularly any others that may be working at the Army post.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Valley View Building Services owner Joel Votaw said his company goes to great lengths to comply with U.S. and Arizona immigration laws, including using E-Verify for all its employees, a system that allows businesses to determine if someone is legally allowed to work in the United States.</p>

		<p>E-Verify can&rsquo;t always catch stolen or fraudulent documents, so even if the business owner is right, it&rsquo;s a moot point.</p>

		<p>A day after a federal judge ruled that the people of Arizona can&rsquo;t enforce immigration laws against illegal aliens, a memo from the Obama Administration shows its plan to grant amnesty to millions with NO VOTE in Congress.-D.A. King/Numbersusa.com</p>
<p>(I went to a Tea Party meeting a couple of months ago to check it out. This D.A. King guy, writing in Marietta, GA&rsquo;s paper, is a former marine and lawyer who now does nothing but fight against illegal immigration. He was very informative, but the meeting was an expected disappointment. Most people there looked to be retirement age. There were only a couple of other people there in their early 30s. Most people my age or younger are too busy trying to live the lives they thought they were suppossed to want. They barely have enough time for themselves after family, kids, job, day-day upkeep, etc. I thought that&rsquo;s why we had a government for and by the people to provide some structure or security. Since I graduated high school, I&rsquo;ve learned some hard lessons about the false senses of security this world has to offer.) </p>

		<p>Ft. Huachuca is a weak spot along the border for illegals to cross. The military will not allow [??] the border partol on base and the MP&rsquo;s are not equipped or trained or have the numbers to stop the illegal flow. Ft. Huachuca is a sensitive post and has been for some time. Illegals know all this and take advantage. What else is there for an illegal to do?</p>
<p>They need to use these Apache types to guard the post like they did in the 1870&rsquo;s and 1880&rsquo;s. Friendly Apache that can track a man like a deer and live off the land.</p>
<p>Sheriff Joe is right on the money. Why is he always so right and so many others are not?</p>

		<p>When I was in the Army (ASA) Huachuca was a very high security area with NO one in but highly cleared U.S. military with a very large lethal force area, Petaluma, CaliFOREIGNER had another similar station and you could be, and would be, killed sneaking on the grounds. And the fear that ILLEGALS have invaded the camp there!!  There are gang bangers in every branch of the military I have worked with over here in Iraq and Afghanistan, tattoos and conduct show it all and they too are basically a protected people.</p>
