			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Karel Prinsloom, Newsweek, July 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Global differences in intelligence is a sensitive topic, long fraught with controversy and still tinged by the disgraceful taint of pseudosciences such as craniometry that strove to prove the white &#8220;race&#8221; as the most clever of them all. But recent data, perplexingly, has indeed shown cognitive ability to be higher in some countries than in others. What&rsquo;s more, IQ scores have risen as nations develop  &mdash;  a phenomenon known as the &#8220;Flynn effect.&#8221; Many causes have been proposed for both the intelligence gap and the Flynn effect, including education, income, and even nonagricultural labor. Now, a new study from researchers at the University of New Mexico offers another intriguing theory: intelligence may be linked to infectious-disease rates.</p>
<p><b>The Idea</b></p>
<p>The brain, say author Christopher Eppig and his colleagues, is the &#8220;most costly organ in the human body.&#8221; Brainpower gobbles up close to 90 percent of a newborn&rsquo;s energy. It stands to reason, then, that if something interferes with energy intake while the brain is growing, the impact could be serious and longlasting. And for vast swaths of the globe, the biggest threat to a child&rsquo;s body  &mdash;  and hence brain  &mdash;  is parasitic infection. These illnesses threaten brain development in several ways. They can directly attack live tissue, which the body must then strain to replace. They can invade the digestive tract and block nutritional uptake. They can hijack the body&rsquo;s cells for their own reproduction. And then there&rsquo;s the energy diverted to the immune system to fight the infection. Out of all the parasites, the diarrheal ones may be the gravest threat  &mdash;  they can prevent the body from getting any nutrients at all.</p>
<p><b>The Evidence</b></p>
<p>Using data on national &#8220;disease burdens&#8221; (life years lost due to infectious diseases) and average intelligence scores, the authors found a striking inverse correlation  &mdash;  around 67 percent. The countries with the lowest average IQ scores  &mdash;  Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, Mozambique, Gabon  &mdash;  have among the highest disease burdens. In contrast, nations with low disease burdens top the IQ list, with Singapore, South Korea, China, Japan, and Italy in the lead.</p>
<p>{snip} it turns out that &#8220;infectious disease remains the most powerful predictor of average national IQ.&#8221; The study&rsquo;s findings may also help explain the Flynn effect, which can&rsquo;t be accounted for by evolution (the IQ gains occur over time spans too short for natural selection). So what&rsquo;s going on instead? As nations develop, they improve their population&rsquo;s access to safe drinking water and to vaccines and medicine  &mdash;  all of which lower parasitic infection rates.</p>

		<p>What this study strongly hints at, but doesn&rsquo;t say outright, because it would be career ending in today&rsquo;s politically correct world, is that people in tropical climates evolved smaller, less energy consuming brains, because it allowed more energy to be devoted to fighting disease. This actually makes scientific sense.</p>
<p>Why people in different climates evolved different degrees of intelligence has always involved a lot of guesswork. Much of it unsatisfactory. For instance, why is the average Eskimo IQ about 15 points lower than they average Scandinavian IQ when both groups live in very cold climates?</p>

This is interesting, and it does make sense. But at this stage, it is only a theory.</p>
<p>Funny we never heard of such infections and their effects on IQ, before&hellip; </p>
<p>It looks like liberals will advance just about any possible cause for lower IQs in Africa, except for genetic (racial) factors.</p>

		<p>China has a low disease burden? Give me a break! The same China that has SARS, Bird Flu, Wuhan strain flu etc. These Leftists will stop at nothing to cover up the truth. The fact is that China probably is afflicted with even more disease than Africa, and yet the IQ is much higher.</p>

		<p>Actually I read somewhere that it is genetics which is the reason we have five fingers on each hand. I also believe that reason chimpanzees are not as intelligent as human has to do with small brain size in relation to body size. The cause of this might be genetics or it could be civil war or colonialism or exploitation blah blah blah.That Watson fellow would have ended up in the Gulag in the old soviet union. That&rsquo;s what the soviets did to people who went around talking about how socialism was unsustainable. Did not James Watson discover DNA. Hmm I would think people might actually agree with what he said about I.Q. and genetics rather than fire him. Notice that the red areas also happen to be Black. The fact is Australian Aborigenes are not too bright yet do not have a big problem with parasites. Occams razor says for any theory or question the answer is usually the simplest. GENETICS. PS.I  think now Parasites has replaced lead poisoning as the excuse dujour as to why blacks have lag in intelligence behind whites.</p>

		<p>What these idiots selectively ignored is that all evolutionary man arose from the same environment.  Parasites, diseases infected all human beings, no matter what racial groups, at equal levels.  All evolutionary humans had to go search for clean water, food, shelter, etc.  Nature does not play favorites.  All racial groups started with nothing.  The development of civilizations including keeping water clean were an evolutionary process.  The black man (no matter where) would still exist in a primitive culture if the whites did not intervene.  But that luxury was not allowed.      </p>
<p>No matter, how some humans twist and turn the truth, it will not go away that there are VAST differences in intelligences between some racial groups.  No amount of money, affirmative action, Head Start, etc. will make that truth go away.  The white races of today are more innovative in many aspects because they possessed a good more portion of the Adam and Eve genes.  The yellow race got some and the red man none. Even though genetically superior to the black man but because of the lack of the Adam and Eve genes, the red man was still living in the Stone Age when discovered by the white man.  Ancient advanced civilizations were submerged when the superior genes became a minority within those cultures which then leads to the questionable destiny of this country.  This country will not survive as an advanced country when the white genes become a minority.  It is a reality that no humans can change, no matter how good or great the intentions of trying to change the genetic ratio.     </p>

<p>Hello.  The racial groups each have different innate IQ differences.  They are created as such.  Just like some animal species are smarter than others.  They are created as such.  Humans are so arrogant believing they can alert human genetic diffences/characteristics by affirmative action, etc. Hopefully, the white race will not destroy itself by miscegenation as in India and other ancient civilizations. </p>

Have you noticed the flurry of theories to explain IQ differences?</p>
<p>I count this as a victory in that these people have begun to admit that IQ is real and measurable.</p>
<p>After all these theories have been exposed as excuses, the only remaining fact regarding IQ differences will be the genetics of race.<br>

<p>Of course it apparently never occurred to them, that the differences in these disease rates, compared to those in White nations where medical advances over centuries have proven near miraculous, just might have something to do with Whites possessing higher IQ&rsquo;s in the first place?!?  <br>

		<p>Note the slant of this article  &mdash;  equating IQ studies with craniometry, the use of quotes around the word race, and the labeling of differences in national IQ as &#8220;perplexing&#8221;.  Okay, so here&rsquo;s another take on the latest excuse for low IQ&rsquo;s among sub-Saharans and Micronesians.  And  &mdash;  ho hum  &mdash;  how do we explain the fact that even black, mixed-race Americans have an average IQ of 85?</p>

		<p>This has to be the stupidest article I have ever read. Even someone with half a brain could see the stupidity.</p>
<p>Basically the article is taking an &#8220;effect&#8221; of national stupidity (not being smart enough to control disease) and stating that the &#8220;effect&#8221; is causing the stupidity! While it could be that the &#8220;effect&#8221; does contribute in some marginal way to a stupid nation&rsquo;s stupidity, the base stupidity was there to begin with.<br>

		<p>How does the author of this piece wish to explain the results of African-Americans? They are generally healthy (excepting self-induced illnesses such as HIV and diabetes) and have been eating the same food as whites for hundreds of years. The last 60 of which in the same diners, or from the same shops, side by side. They still score well below the White average&hellip;</p>

		<p>GEE, then there must have been a huge increase in the African IQ during the period when those &#8220;evil&#8221; white colonists provided clean water facilities, built hospitals and health facilities, and trained local blacks in the basics of hygiene and preventive medical techniques where before there was just worse than total ignorance - the vile superstitions of witch-doctors.</p>
<p>Pity they kicked most whites out in the 1960´s as Europe has grown so much more prosperous since then and if whites were still running those countries I´m sure that every African town and city would have a clean source of running water plus they would be far safer places for legions of white &#8220;do-gooders&#8221; to live and work in.   Just imagine how high the African IQ might now be if all those IQ-sapping parasitic diseases had been brought under control as before &#8220;liberation&#8221; they largely had been in racist Rhodesia and South Africa.</p>
<p>When are the liberals who write trashy articles like this going to stop lying and admit that the so-called &#8220;liberation&#8221; of Africa was an unmitigated disaster for all but a tiny corrupt and brutal power elite.</p>

		<p> What a bunch of politically correct claptrap! &#8220;The dog ate my homework, and the parasites ate my brain!&#8221; Even if this preposterous claim could be proven   &mdash;   which I doubt   &mdash;   it would not account in any way for the 15-point IQ gap between White and black Americans who have lived here all their lives.</p>
<p> This whole story smacks of a desperate attempt to prove that, &#8220;Blacks are NOT dumber! They&rsquo;re not! They&rsquo;re not! They&rsquo;re not!&#8221; But then, why are their IQs lower, on average, all around the world   &mdash;   not just in steamy, parasite-ridden Africa? The author slides right around that issue. Newsweek is a news magazine that we might well expect to publish a smokescreen like this   &mdash;   but sorry, it won&rsquo;t wash. </p>

		<p>This does not explain the IQ difference found in those of different races that grew up in the same environment, such as the US.</p>
<p>It is merely an excuse and a poor one at that. Perhaps it is so poor, because the IQ level of the person that thought it out, wasn&rsquo;t too high.</p>

<p>&#8220;ALL PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE MAN HAS ACQUIRED TURNS OUT TO BE WORNG&#8221; (mispelled for humorous effect)</p>
<p>Scientists have discovered that wetness causes rain, daylight is the source of the sun, and Africans are less intelligent because they have lead dysfunctional, disordered, present-oriented, impulsive lives for millenia. <br>
As it turns out, scientists say, it&rsquo;s not that low intelligence causes a dirth of cultural achievement, or does it cause-or even contribute to- extremely high levels of violence and mayhem. </p>
<p>Simply put, if you laze about, brush your teeth with fire-dried cow dung, lop the clitoris and external genitalia off your daughters, rape babies to cure your case of AIDs, and die like flies in massive famines-while engaging in extremely brutal tribal warfare wherein you sometimes eat the guts of your enemies (oh, and if you burn child-witches, and hack off their limbs), THAT&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re an idiot.<br>

<p>My God, My God.<br>
The darkest of ages is surely here.<br>
There can be no more henoius example of force-fed religious dogma than the insane quote just listed above.<br>
I&rsquo;d expect to hear such bald-faced doublespeak in a court of the Spanish Inquisition, or in a Sharia tribunal, or maybe in a Stalinist Kangaroo court&hellip;maybe in one of Hitler&rsquo;s courts, you know, where judges shouted shrilly at defendants who had been accused (to their honor) of trying to kill the bastard. Those judges were judging noting; they were reciting-screaming- from a script drafted by the Nazis. There were no trials, merely summary decrees. <br>
Today, in the land of the free, in a time of enlightenment and science, we get no better&hellip;worms who spout the statist line, to get their next paycheck. This society is DEAD.</p>
<p>Cowards and groveling worms will say anything to be accepted, to be kept alive, and to get their reward (which, ironically, always ends up with the coward being done in by a fellow sycophant).</p>

		<p><i>it turns out that &ldquo;infectious disease remains the most powerful predictor of average national IQ.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>Well, yes and no. </p>
<p>First the &#8220;yes&#8221; part. I actually agree that infectious disease (and nutrition) affect IQ. Otherwise, blacks in America wouldn&rsquo;t score about 15 points higher than blacks in Africa. Despite rumours that this is due to blacks in America being &#8220;mixed&#8221; the amount of mixture just isn&rsquo;t enough to account for the whole 15 points. Maybe 3 or 4 points of it.</p>
<p>And, now, the &#8220;no&#8221; part. Although it&rsquo;s true that blacks in America pick up several points for having a lower disease burden (and better nutrition) it only eliminates half the gap between west african and higher performing countries. Thus, the entire difference can&rsquo;t be explained by the &#8220;disease burden&#8221; theory.</p>
<p>In other words, the difference is due to both environment AND genetics. Regardless of how much the environment improves there will still be a gap. This article was designed to explain away the genetics part by attributing it all to environment. But it can&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s more, IQ scores have risen as nations develop &mdash; a phenomenon known as the &#8216;Flynn effect.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Gee, I wonder why &#8220;nations develop.&#8221;  Might it have something to do with a higher initial IQ?  Perhaps, way back along the evolutionary scale, some people were intelligent enough to realize that &#8220;brain parasites&#8221; were robbing their offspring of precious brain power, and migrated to climes where there were fewer brain parasites?  I think that this &#8220;Flynn effect&#8221; might just indeed explain &#8220;white flight.&#8221;  Too many brain parasites in the inner city.</p>

		<p>The old bloodlines vs environment  argument redux.  If infectious diseases are the problem then why when these same people come to first world countries and breed here there offspring remain low iq, generation after generation.</p>
<p>No doubt a healthy environment will allow children to optimize, but they remain borderline retarded.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the countries mentioned were cherrypicked.  For instance, Southeast Asia just across the way from Japan is also filled with diseases and parasites, but their IQ&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t seem to suffer.</p>
<p>What about South America where IQ more closely correlates to native genes than geography or paracites.</p>
<p>Look up the book &#8220;IQ and the Wealth of nations&#8221; and learn the truth, IQ rules the condition of man.  High IQ&rsquo;s live in better circumstances than low IQ nations across the board.  Look at African countries such as Zimbabwe, where the country has gone to hell in just 25 years of black rule.  The same is true everywhere colonies were turned over to minorities with Haiti being the standard bearer.</p>

		<p>As to whether and how much white admixture raises the average IQ of blacks: the elites in every black society, like Haiti, are composed largely of lighter-skinned individuals.  The Coloreds in SA have an average IQ of 85, while the Blacks&rsquo; is 70.  The American black underclass is composed mostly of the darkest people in the nation.  Even Thomas Jefferson remarked on the difference white blood makes.</p>

		<p>The access to the show Jersey Shore causes IQ increase</p>
<p>I would think that this would cause the IQ to plummit! </p>
<p>All kidding aside, most of these supposed scholars are just dancing around the real issue, certain groups just have lower IQs that others. Truth be told about half of the planet could only be taught basic skills like reading at about a 4th-5th grade level and basic arithmetic operations. Anything more than this is just about out of their comfort zone and they cannot wrap their minds around it. It is little wonder why most of the poor behavior and violence among black kids starts around 3rd and 4th grade, that is when more advanced topics are started and kids just dont get it and start to act out. Couple that with early puberty and you can have a real mess on your hands.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t buy into this &#8220;parasitic invasion of the brain&#8221; theory at all. It doesn&rsquo;t explain the IQ gap between American or European Bantus to their Caucasian counterparts. It doesn&rsquo;t explain how the ancient Egyptians built civilizations, or the Phoenicians, Greeks, Babylonians and Romans after them. Surely, these peoples were exposed to parasites in their lands, both in soil and water. Nor does it explain how New World civilizations developed, whose peoples were also exposed to parasites.</p>
<p>These &#8220;researchers&#8221; are just grasping.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Why people in different climates evolved different degrees of intelligence has always involved a lot of guesswork. Much of it unsatisfactory. For instance, why is the average Eskimo IQ about 15 points lower than they average Scandinavian IQ when both groups live in very cold climates?&#8221;<br>

 <br>
A society based on cities places a greater premium on intelligence than a paleolithic or neolithic society.  Men with superior intelligence become successful merchants, artisans, government officials, and so on.  This enables them to have more children who survive and reproduce.<br>
 <br>
This is why population groups that have been civilized for centuries score better on IQ tests than those which have more recently been lifted from savagery or barbarism.  </p>

Well, yes and no. </p>
<p>First the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; part. I actually agree that infectious disease (and nutrition) affect IQ.  Otherwise, blacks in America wouldn&rsquo;t score about 15 points higher than blacks in Africa.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The core of this argument then presumes that the top out average IQ of blacks in Africa (without white admixture) must also be something like 85.  If they are not inhibited by parasytic problems.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Despite rumours that this is due to blacks in America being &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; the amount of mixture just isn&rsquo;t enough to account for the whole 15 points. Maybe 3 or 4 points of it.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know the percentage, I would think that it would be an effective argument for the nature of racial admixture (how many &#8216;drops&rsquo; are in the mulatto bucket) as a correlate to white IQ.  I&rsquo;m surprised that nobody like Murray or Rushton has done any statistical family history analysis between groups having low vs. high admixture as it would certainly be an interesting casepoint.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
And, now, the &ldquo;no&rdquo; part. Although it&rsquo;s true that blacks in America pick up several points for having a lower disease burden (and better nutrition) it only eliminates half the gap between west african and higher performing countries. Thus, the entire difference can&rsquo;t be explained by the &ldquo;disease burden&rdquo; theory.</p>
<p>In other words, the difference is due to both environment AND genetics. Regardless of how much the environment improves there will still be a gap. This article was designed to explain away the genetics part by attributing it all to environment. But it can&rsquo;t.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The real question lies in determining how much and for how long.  We are talking multiple millenia of time frame here folks.  Time in which constant tribal warfare, a very harsh natural environment (lions, crocs, hippos etc.) and yes, bugs of all types, has created a selective-advantaged environment for early maturity.</p>
<p>Presumably because the head men of a given society were dying out young enough that having the -physical- means to move forward into adult roles let younger men achieve social preeminence and thus breeding access.  Such would certainly facilitate a Darwinian fitness advantagement.</p>
<p>But it should not necessarily inhibit the dominance of intelligence so much as select for it at a younger age as the remaining youth group should still sort for intelligence in achieving tribal dominance.  And that dominance should in turn translate to how well their families etc. are provided for.  Good Hunters = Smart Hunters = Good Protein Supply enabling.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t buy the immune/parasytic analysis in it&rsquo;s entirety because not everyone will get sick together, many will not survive who do and there is no correlate for how much energy the immune/lymph system function requires as it&rsquo;s own caloric deficit upon overall daily metabolism if you do not in fact get sick -because- of superior immune function.  Only if higher brain function itself inhibits immune capabilities (causing more general die off) should there be a direct causal comparison.</p>
<p>Indeed, until we know how much of this emphasis on physical development has in terms of speeding the growth cycle and inhibiting brain development past a given MA:CA correlation, we will not know where to attack the problem with suitable pharmacology (to depress rapid maturation) and gene therapy (to selectively advantage for cranial brain mass:volume, corpos collosum architecture or myelineal composition).</p>
<p>All of which ARE known to be related to IQ and ARE genetically driven traits.  Which would still require a qualitative analysis of inferior/superior equivalents in other races for backfit to blacks.</p>
<p>i.e.  You cannot get past the genetics of advantagement no matter which way you choose to &#8216;justify&rsquo; an impairment.</p>
<p>Short of mass miscegenation, I don&rsquo;t see any other way to defeat evolutionary adjustments to environment in anything less than evolutionary time cycles.  And given the way lies about the &#8216;non&rsquo; differences between us are tearing society apart, we literally don&rsquo;t have time for that.</p>

<p>That may well be true. But according to analysis by population geneticist Dr Mark Shriver, black americans average only 17% white admixture. It&rsquo;s unlikely 17% admixture is responsible for cutting the black / white gap by 50%. One would expect it take 50% admixture to do that. Therefore, one has to assume either improved environment or 300 years of selective pressure is responsible for most of the increase.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think it is as much to do with intelligence as long-term planning skills. Climates which have a harsh winter AND a bountiful summer have shaped the minds of Norther Europeans and NE Asians. They had to PLAN AHEAD for winter or they would be culled by mother nature. Africa, Eskimos, etc don&rsquo;t really have to contend with this long survival thinking. That&rsquo;s why blacks don&rsquo;t think about the long term, they don&rsquo;t understand the importance of education or the importance of not doing a crime. They cannot connect their actions with long term results. It&rsquo;s why whites and asians have the most strategic minds and the greatest ability to delay gratification.</p>

		<p>I havent been able to find this on the internet but at a library I read that in 1960´s Australia extensive IQ research was done  amongst Aboriginal orphans living on outback missions stations.  None of these children knew of their grandparents or great-grandparents although the people running the mission stations did as they kept extensive genealogical records.</p>
<p>As one would expect the children with some white admixture did much better on the tests but the most surprising discovery was that it only took a small infusion of white genes to raise their IQ levels much more than would be predicted by simple  mathematics.   </p>

		<p>When the Europeans came to the New World, the New World was free of serious diseases, and the Europeans brought Small Pox, and Measles.  They also brought a superior level of civilization and technology.  In North and South America those of European ancestry have always tended to out score those of Indian ancestry on IQ tests.  </p>

		<p>What a load of rubbish. </p>
<p>Blacks have a lower level of intelligence than almost any other race simply because they have evolved that way.</p>
<p>They also have much lower energy levels and drive, which results in their inherent laziness. </p>
<p>To compound their problems in modern societies, they do not have the ability to think laterally. </p>
<p>Races are completely different physically why must it be assumed that all races are equally intelligent and that all have the same inherent capabilities. This just does not make any sort of sense.</p>
<p>The above does not need to be &#8220;researched&#8221;, it is blatantly obvious when one looks at the performance of blacks around the world in all sorts of different environments.</p>
<p>As for some or other disease causing blacks to have a lower intelligence how do they explain the poor performance of blacks who have never been in Africa, or any other disease ridden country, but were born of generations of blacks living in civilised countries such as the USA?</p>
<p>Only the narrow minded liberals would pretend that &#8220;every one is the same no matter what the race&#8221;. </p>
<p>In fact, this research has acknowledged one thing although perhaps unintentionally ie it is an acknowledgment that Blacks ARE less intelligent than most other races.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t say you made it up. And if true it would be very interesting. So interesting in fact that I can&rsquo;t believe other researchers haven&rsquo;t followed up on it. If true it should be more famous than the &#8220;flynn effect&#8221;. But I&rsquo;ve never heard of such a thing and I have to ask myself, &#8220;Why?&#8221; Is the study valid? Has it been discredited by subsequent studies? Did you misunderstand the study or summarize it incorrectly? If I knew the author I could read it for myself and answer those questions. But without an author it&rsquo;s not science, it&rsquo;s just gossip based on a study that may or may not have been performed on a rural outback orphanage 50 years ago. So please don&rsquo;t quote studies unless you can name the author.</p>

<p>Contacting Lynn is a good idea. I&rsquo;m skeptical of whatever testing might have been performed on rural abbo orphans. But surely there must be have been some other IQ studies done on mixed populations since then. And if there have he would definitely be the one to know.</p>

<p>But apparently, you couldn&rsquo;t find any substantion for this idea of even a tiny infusion of white genes causing their IQ&rsquo;s to skyrocket. I doubt it, since that flies in the face of basic laws of biology- unless those children&rsquo;s parents happened to be considerably inbred.</p>
