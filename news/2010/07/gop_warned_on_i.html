<h1><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0710/39271.html">GOP Warned on Immigration</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scott Wong, Politico, July 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama&rsquo;s allies have been blasting the GOP&rsquo;s blockade of immigration-reform legislation, making the case that Republicans will alienate a core constituency  &mdash;  conservative Christians  &mdash;  unless they get on board.</p>
<p>Republicans have brushed off that warning, calling it a distraction from the president&rsquo;s failure to fix the nation&rsquo;s broken immigration system. In fact, recent polls show there&rsquo;s little support among white evangelicals for a Democrat-backed plan that includes a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The tussle over evangelical Christians comes as Obama prepares to give a speech Thursday in which he&rsquo;ll make his strongest push yet for immigration reform. The White House has given little attention to the matter, even after Obama vowed on the campaign trail to make it a &#8220;top priority&#8221; in his first year in office.</p>
<p>Support for reform is growing among evangelicals like the Southern Baptist Convention&rsquo;s Richard Land and other conservatives including News Corp. chief Rupert Murdoch, said Ali Noorani, who heads immigrant advocacy group National Immigration Forum.</p>
<p>So if Republicans continue to thwart reform efforts, Noorani and others say, they risk losing support among what perhaps is their largest constituency.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But a recent nationwide Quinnipiac University poll out showed that just 12 percent of 454 white born-again and evangelical Christians said they backed reform policies that integrate illegal immigrants into American society. Eighty-three percent said they wanted reform to focus on stricter enforcement of illegal immigration laws.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 68 percent said they support Arizona&rsquo;s tough new immigration law, while 15 percent oppose it. The law, known as SB1070, requires police officers to verify the immigration status of individuals if there is suspicion they are in the country illegally.</p>
<p>Assistant Polling Director Peter Brown said it&rsquo;s important to draw a distinction between white and minority evangelical voters.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not surprising that Hispanic evangelicals would have a diametrically opposed opinion to white evangelicals,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;The political views and values of white evangelicals are very different from those of African American evangelical Christians and Hispanic evangelical Christians.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Someone did an analysis, and calculated that, on a national basis, for every nine Hispanic voters the GOP loses, it only needs to gain one white voter to break even.  In Arizona, that ratio is 5:1.  It&rsquo;s a lot easier for the GOP to get one white than it is nine Hispanics, nationally speaking, and it&rsquo;s easier for them to get one white than five Hispanics in Arizona.</p>

		<p>What a meaningless threat! It is highly doubtful that this group has been voting Republican in the first place. The GOP would probably pick up more votes from former white Democrats if they would stick to their guns on immigration and border security.</p>

		<p>There are Hispanics who vote Republican. They have different concerns from Hispanics who vote Democrat.  For example, most are opposed to easier immigration policies.  The Republicans will only alienate them if they try to become more like Democrats on immigration.  </p>

		<p>I would also say that the GOP could capture the elusive black vote if their party platform contained strict border enforcement, and stiff sanctions against anyone providing housing and employment to illegal aliens.  Also one that refused welfare benefits to any illegal aliens and children of illegal aliens (whether they are anchor babies or not).  Last, but not least a twenty-five year moratorium on all LEGAL immigration except in cases of racial or ethnic cleansing.  </p>
<p>Fourteen million Americans are unemployed.  The most conservative guesstimate puts that many people working illegally in this country.  If these trespassers left, black and White Americans may not end up with their dream jobs, but they would have the wherewithal to at least sustain themselves.  The budget reductions from not providing benefits to unemployed people one food stamps and welfare would make up for any tax cuts necessary to generate enough business entrepreneurs to create new jobs.  It&rsquo;s a win-win-win situation for everybody.  </p>
<p>Last, but not least, the money that illegals wire out of the country every weekend is NOT just being spent on their families back in their homelands, it is going to private bank accounts.  One Mexican who decided to self-deport after the economy caused the company who hired him to go out of business told me that he had cashed out a little ranchero in his home town in Mexico.  He had a garden, animals and fruit trees.  He, at least, wasn&rsquo;t worried.  I imagine he was the norm rather than the exception.<br>

<p>I remember an article posted on AmRen awhile ago; it was about how religious leaders are out of touch in politics with their followers.</p>
<p>The author of the article is being very deceptive. Religious leaders have always been liberal-oriented and out of touch with their followers, as I just explained. No one&rsquo;s views on immigration are changing, leaders or followers alike.</p>

		<p>The GOP can&rsquo;t win this one, Blacks want a free ride -or, at least heavily subsidized, and the Latinos want open borders so they can &#8216;get a better life&rsquo; which means they can access benefits provided by someone else. The behavior of Latino US citizens clearly demonstrates where their loyalties lie. The Democrats are willing to sell out the country for the votes of these permanent dependents.<br>

		<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t forget how many white people are not going to vote.</p>
<p>Normally, people who are against something vote more than people who agree with something. But with white issues that is not the case because whites don&rsquo;t feel represented by Michael Steele and the politics which is only a copy of Obama.</p>
<p>Whites have voted for Obama. Many whites are now scared of Obama. What would make more sense than putting a white guy on the top of the GOP and totally oppose Obama and do politics for whites?</p>
<p>I means if they say: &#8220;Well don&rsquo;t want so much health care&#8221; people will shout but when they say &#8220;&hellip; so you will have 500 Dollars more per month&#8221; they will accept it. </p>

<p>They are even more dangerous to our race and our survival. I have stopped listening to the Rushs, O&rsquo;Reillys  Hannitys and Levins and all the rest, because they are the biggest traitors to our race. Isn&rsquo;t the word conservative meant to PRESERVE? They are doing just the opposite. <br>

		<p>I believe that the main power of the Tea Party movement lies in American opposition to illegal immigration.  Both major parties have failed in solving the crisis because they don&rsquo;t want to solve it.  By continuing to do nothing, both believe they can balance both sides against the middle and not alienate (pun intended) either side.  Leaders, including religious ones, can talk about paths to legalization or immigration control without explaining what they mean.  Such measures can be very strict, even calling for illegals to return to their countries and apply for citizenship.  The rules will almost certainly demand English proficiency, lack of felony records, and payment of fees and fines.  How many poor, ignorant Mexicans and Central Americans will avail themselves of such a procedure?  Many of these people don&rsquo;t give a hoot about being American citizens.  <br>

		<p>Republicans know that whites have no place else to go.  The Democrats are overtly genocidal.  The Republicans are a party of big business crooks who cynically prey on whites in the atmosphere of their impending doom,  and it all takes place in a system that makes 3rd party or independent input all but impossible and is devoid of free speech and press.  In many ways the Republicans have played a clever game over the last few decades.   They were a perennial minority party that parlayed the Democrat&rsquo;s white-hating racism into considerable victory at the polls,  never doing anything to reverse that racism because it was their chief recruiting tool (and as a bonus it spared them flack from the media).   They realized that in the long run the tactic would crash and burn,  but for them politics is just an extension of business in which doing everything to boost the quarterly report and getting the big bonus today and not worrying about the long run is the normal operating mode.   Business men who walk away from a stint in a company with a big house and bank book are heroes to these people even, and perhaps specially, if the company is left in ruins.  Proves they were one of the &#8220;smart guys&#8221; - everyone left in the ruins was Darwinistically unfit and unworthy, whether it&rsquo;s the ruins of a company or of a nation.     </p>

		<p>I, and probably many other conservative Christians, have no intention of &#8220;getting on board&#8221; if it means bowing to the illegal alien lobby. We know how we want our country to be and it doesn&rsquo;t include hoards of people who&rsquo;ve laughed at our laws. This is the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. We&rsquo;ve never bowed to anyone. We do not want to be &#8220;fundamentally changed.&#8221; We want the America that existed when we had leaders who protected and respected us, when we had a country that defended our rights against all enemies, and a country that followed the rule of law. We haven&rsquo;t had that in some time. I&rsquo;m ready to fight for it and hope that every right thinking American will too.</p>

		<p>I prefer to look at it from an economic stance.  If you replace the &#8216;cheap&rsquo; ethnic wage slaves with robotics (literally, Terminators designed for stoop labor) you can support the &#8216;non competitive&rsquo; U.S. professional class because you are generating corporate wealth for every human you replace in large scale labor.</p>
<p>The need to drive down the wage component of the U.S. GDP fraction is what is behind this and that in turn is all about corporate not religious or political policies.</p>
<p>This is why I think that what you see here are classic &#8216;front&rsquo; arguments.  Groups being put forward as though their views were important in a constant parade of counter opinion designed specifically to confuse and depress the held beliefs until the target group &#8216;gives in&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We have to replace the Mexican labor source before we can effectively win over big business as the group behind all this slanted attack bias.  And that means getting our universties away from supporting military robotics and onto civilian (longer life, higher returns on investment) service versions.</p>
<p>Morality is cheap to these people.  But if you talk bottom line, they will listen.</p>

<p>Richard Land??? I have heard him many times on Bott Christian radio and he is a complete sell-out of his own race and country. Here is a link of how he &#8220;explains&#8221; his position on illegals.  Be sure to read the comments. Sure glad I am not a Southern Baptist with the likes of him running the show.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where you are completely wrong! You&rsquo;re seeing only part of the picture, and thinking it&rsquo;s the most important part.  It&rsquo;s not.  Although economics certainly do play a part in it, as a strong inducement to get business&rsquo; help, this is about MUCH MORE than economics. This is about deliberate race replacement.  </p>
<p>With or without cheap labor, there are powerful groups and ideologies that are DETERMINED to create a multi-racial society (as they are doing everywhere in every white country in the world). Is that an accident?  Is that only about labor?  Many of those  third world &#8220;refugees&#8221; being imported into European countries don&rsquo;t even work! But they keep coming. They don&rsquo;t just come on their own; they&rsquo;re invited and sponsored!  What labor benefit is had there? </p>
<p>You need to see the complete picture.  There are groups who are determined to have this invasion continue.  The economic lure of cheap labor helps them to  sell the idea to the business community, but they would push for multiculturalism/multiracialism NO MATTER WHAT!</p>

		<p>What would happen if instead of wringing their hands over the loss of a few percent of hispanic voters, the GOP crafted a fresh, well-designed, new argument about illegal immigration intended to appeal to lower middle class and middle class whites?</p>
<p>What would happen if they based that argument on the idea of &#8220;attrition through enforcement&#8221; i.e. making working and living in this country so difficult that most of the illegals packed up and went back to Mexico on their own - thus freeing up millions of jobs for lower middle class citizens?</p>
<p>What would happen if they made it clear that importing foreign workers was over and that American college graduates would come first when it came to jobs in the hi-tech sector?</p>
<p>I think the odds are good that the electoral victories that might come as a result of such a message would counter whatever  reaction that might come from the cheap labor, big business interests that currently own most of the party. After all, where else are they going to go? *smirk* </p>
