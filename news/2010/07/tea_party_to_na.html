<h1><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0710/39673.html">Tea Party to NAACP: &#8216;Grow Up&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andy Barr, Politico, July 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A spokesman for a group of tea party activists on Tuesday said that they are taking offense to a resolution the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is set to approve that condemns the grassroots movement as &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the NAACP to accuse the tea parties of racism is insulting to the great patriots who have participated in this movement, and sadly shows just how out of touch that group is with the American people,&#8221; Tea Party Express spokesman Levi Russell told POLITICO.</p>
<p>The NAACP is expected to vote at its annual conference as soon as Tuesday on a resolution that accuses tea Party activists of having used racial epithets in denouncing the policies of President Barack Obama and of having verbally and physically abused members of Congress.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In response, Russell said the resolution fails to recognize minorities&rsquo; contributions to the grassroots movement and attacked the NAACP for lobbing racism charges without evidence to back them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The racism accusation by the likes of the NAACP has been proved false time and again. Earlier this year, Democrats smeared tea party activists by claiming members of the Black Caucus were spit on and called the n-word as they paraded through a crowd of tea partiers,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Their blatant lie was proved false by overwhelming evidence from multiple video cameras that recorded the event.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;As the tea party movement has gained political momentum, groups or individuals still playing the race card look like a foolish embarrassment to their own party,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s time for the NAACP to grow up and stop hiding behind hypocritical race-baiting politics.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve had some personal run ins with St. Louis Tea Party &#8220;leaders.&#8221;  And some of them are the same kind of anti-white racists that you can find in the NAACP.</p>

		<p>Why would anyone be defensive about liking their own race more than any other, isn&rsquo;t that really the definition of racist. Are you called a &#8220;familist&#8221; if you like your family more than another person family. Now days it seems it isn&rsquo;t proper to be a nationalist and love your country. Well I&rsquo;m all three and I don&rsquo;t care who doesn&rsquo;t like it and that admission disarms those who would try and throw you off balance by the accusations. To be anything else would bring shame to myself, my family, and my country.<br/>

		<p>When are we going to recognize the National Association for the Advancement of Communist Colored People for what it is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just another one of the tools of these traitors for the total dissolution of this society. Let&rsquo;s look at the rest of what they have in the tool box:</p>
<p>1. A complete failure of the Black community to improve itself despite decades of social programs paid for on the backs of the productive sector of the society AKA Whites.</p>
<p>2. A totally laissez faire attitude when it comes to the borders thereby permitting hundreds of thousands of illegals to enter this country; including Muslims with malevolent intentions toward us.</p>
<p>3. A drastic increase in violent crime against White people mainly perpetrated by the above mentioned groups. This includes an increase in violent rhetoric by Blacks directed at the productive White population.</p>
<p>4. The decades of guilt indoctrination of our White children by our public schools.</p>
<p>5. The incremental hegemony of Islamic groups due to the apparent total surrender of our government.</p>
<p>Is there anyone out there besides me who sees a pattern here?</p>

		<p>The NAACP is scared to death of the Tea Party movement and it has nothing to do with racists, imagined or real.  The accusation of racism is just a tool to scare White people away from the Tea Party.  Whites and especially Tea Party advocates need to counter attack the NAACP by attacking their connection with the likes of the New Black Panther Party.  It&rsquo;s not enough to just duck and block when the NAACP or the Black Panthers or any of the many other Black acctivists swing at us.  You can&rsquo;t win a battle by forever playing defense.  Whites need to start speaking up for ourselves more.  Just once I would like to see a couple hundred Whites demonstrating outside an NAACP headquarters.  I know the Tea Party crowd is not working under the direction of one leader, but maybe it&rsquo;s time they all got together and rounded up a crowd of Tea Party people to demonstrate in front of NAACP headquarters, peacefully of course.</p>

		<p>The character of an organization is sometimes best discerned by its performance under extraordinary conditions.</p>
<p>Stuart Taylor is a contributing editor for Newsweek, a columnist for National Journal and co-author of Until Proven Innocent: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case. Taylor describes the NC NAACP&rsquo;s performance: </p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;The local NAACP and other local black leaders  &mdash;  enough to be a critical mass  &mdash;  basically crusaded to attack the lacrosse players. They joined the mob. They misrepresented the truth regularly, repeatedly, and grossly. They supported the rogue prosecutor long after he had been proven a rogue prosecutor. They threw away the opportunity to build that cross-racial coalition and they threw away whatever shreds were left of their own credibility.&rdquo; (Taylor in a BookTV.org presentation on Until Proven Innocent, Sept. 11, 2007)</p>

		<p>For the average white, to be called &#8220;racist&#8221; is just as offensive as to be called the N-word to the average black. Only when all whites have learned not to be afraid of the R-word will we be free of the &#8220;guilt&#8221; that has made us bend our institutions and allocate our monies in the interests of the black elite.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I like what Fritz says about whites always playing defense. It&rsquo;s true.  The fact is that whites have been on the defensive, and backing down, throughout most of the 20th century. And look where it has got us!  We have lost battle after battle and are now in the process of losing our country. We need to stop being so passive and defensive.</p>
<p>Another point is that taking to the streets and demonstrating is something American whites simply  do not do.  It&rsquo;s not a &#8220;white thing.&#8221;   Perhaps in old Europe it was, at one time,  but not here.  Rioting, demonstrating, and street battles are features of urban culture. But that was at a time when mobs could gather and march half a mile to the government buildings.  Ghetto blacks still do that. But American whites over the past half century have become so suburbanized and detached that they would have to organize car pools, buses, and drive at least  30 miles to downtown. </p>
<p>And in most cases,  Washington or the state capitol are a long way off for most whites   &mdash;  -  whereas in Paris or Berlin or St. Peterburg it was just a stone&rsquo;s throw to the palace where they  could make themselves heard.    Here, it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Rioting and demonstrating just aren&rsquo;t our thing. We&rsquo;re not good at it.  And for middle class people,   sit-ins, shake-downs, shouting matches,  and trashing offices aren&rsquo;t considered &#8220;nice&#8221;.   But we&rsquo;ll have to develop some strategy before all is lost.  Otherwise, in a couple of generations we&rsquo;ll  be the ghetto class, and the new rulers won&rsquo;t be so tolerant and permissive with us.<br/>

		<p>TEA means &#8220;taxed enough already.&#8221; Its members feel that less government waste rather than more taxation is the way to go. It&rsquo;s not a racist group per se; it&rsquo;s tired of seeing tax money urinated away on program after program for people who just can&rsquo;t cut the mustard in this world. Overwhelmingly, that means blacks, but I don&rsquo;t think the tea partiers really care what color the deadbeats are.</p>
<p>Attack them enough, and the tea partiers WILL for the sake of survival become racialists. Afterall, it&rsquo;s always wise to know who your enemies are. Blacks are digging a pit for themselves, and the day they will be shoved into it in self-defense is something to look forward to.</p>

		<p>If the Tea Party is going to win these debates ultimately they will have to have a more reasonable definition of what a &#8220;racist&#8221; is then the NAACP, from the eyes of the general public. The NAACP will always choose a definition that caters to the backs and in that effort the Tea Party can win over the general public.  </p>

<p>Fritz,<br/>
I honestly believe that a large number of Whites are psychlogically and physically intimidated by Blacks and apparently for good reason. You can see it on the streets the way they shrink in terror when approached by Blacks. They know that Blacks have no control of their impulses and seem to lack the  ability to analyze situations but simply react and too many times violently. <br/>
In Philadelphia recently a young girl of mixed race vanished from her neighborhood.  She was later found raped and murdered. They arrested a subject who confessed to the crime. Video cameras show him riding his bike down a street while the girl walking down the street in the opposite direction. He suddenly turns around and follows the girl. Just that quickly he acts on his savage impulses without any regard for her or her life.</p>

		<p>Because of changing times and the typical bad management of blacks, the NAACP has become weak, ineffectual, and passe.  The organization is desperate to look relevant and to stay before the public eye.  Thus, it has loudly joined the liberal fray against the Tea Party.  <br/>
Little does the left seem to realize that most Americans are sick and tired of minority privelege.  Liberals are merely preaching to the choir in decrying right-of-center or even moderate grassroots movements.  They&rsquo;re probably helping the Tea Party by criticizing it, so let them howl all they want.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Whites need to start speaking up for ourselves more&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, no kidding.</p>
<p>The most feeble, lame statement a White can make is:  &#8220;I&rsquo;m not racist!&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already lost and have been defeated.</p>
<p>A racial accusation demands an immediate counter-attack. </p>
<p>Recently, poster White Scholar wrote some extremely useful talking points that Whites can use when accused of racism:</p>
<p>&#8220;You say that because I&rsquo;m White!&#8221;</p>
<p>Non-Whites know that the quickest way to disarm a White and to put him in a groveling, subservient, apologetic  position and put himself, a non-White in a superior position, is to use the &#8220;You&rsquo;re a racist!&#8221; line.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried this talking point at school and it works  &mdash;  your opponent expects you to start up with the usual sniveling &#8220;I&rsquo;m not a racist!&#8221; and is thrown totally off guard and left speechless.  Now, they&rsquo;re on the defense instead of you.</p>
<p>If the idiot starts up on historical White racism such as slavery, colonialism, Jim Crow laws, apartheid, all the talking points HE learns from the media and academia state:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not those people and neither are you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Repeat as necessary.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired of non-Whites accusing Whites of genocide and racism as they make use of White-created technology such as cell phones, iPods and computers and take advantage of White creations such as anti-biotics, clean water and first-world medicine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken to asking, when confronted, as to who they think created all of these things that have made their lives 100% better  &mdash;    things such as air conditioners and cars.</p>
<p>You can be sure school textbooks do not teach one thing about White-created Western Civilization, instead bashing White Civilization as one of exploitation and hegemony, a dying Civilization that the world is better off without.  </p>
<p>Our inventions are being assigned increasingly to non-Whites, mention of such things as the space program is only in the context of the non-White astronauts that rode on the Space Shuttle, lauded as heroes, given full-page biographies replete with full color portraits.  Not one iota as to how the Space Shuttle, the entire Space Program, the amazing technology and science needed to pull it off, was created and built.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if these things were &#8216;just there&rsquo;, created by no one, for non-Whites to take advantage of.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p> The tea partiers shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised-this is what has always come of their constant pandering to blacks-less than a &#8220;teacup&#8221; full of black support and votes. Blacks are the most liberal demographic category in the American electorate-90% plus typically vote democrat in U. S. presidential elections. If you think you&rsquo;re going to persuade them as a group to support any conservative cause, you should be under lock and key! No amount of pandering is going to change black people into conservatives. As Pat Buchanan says, both the tea partiers and the Republican Party should &#8220;Go hunting where the ducks are!&#8221; At most tea party events, there are more blacks on the speakers platform than in the audience. The tea party leaders typically respond to liberal accusations of racism within the tea party movement by frantically enlisting pliant blacks to become &#8220;spokespersons&#8221; and &#8220;leaders&#8221; in their movement. Note to both the tea party movement and the Republican Party-if you don&rsquo;t reward and give recognition to your base, don&rsquo;t be surprised if they don&rsquo;t support you-they won&rsquo;t, and you will fail-again and again and again. Your base is white people, because conservatism is an implicitly white movement-embrace your destiny or fade into oblivion! Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results.</p>

		<p>It is pathetic watching these Tea Party sissies, whine and cry that they aren&rsquo;t in any way RACIST. </p>
<p>White Americans have to learn how to respond to name calling and threats by Blacks and other NWs. When some Black person - in this case an official of an openly racially advocacy group - The NAACP hisses:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re all RACISTS&#8221;</p>
<p>What are you going to do? How do you respond?</p>
<p>Whining and moaning about your not in any way RACISTS and how you hate all White people who have ever in any way been RACIST and how you love Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela (Robert Mugabe) and the LA Rodney King Rioters - this doesn&rsquo;t work well, just makes you - and all White people look like jail house punks.</p>
<p>On a personal level, strongly recommend that everyone on this Amren list takes a zero tolerance policy for White cowards/sissies who back down, pander when called RACIST.</p>

		<p>Well, I guess I&rsquo;m a racist.  I believe that there are distinct racial differences, to wit, skin tone, average height and weight, hair and eye color, temperament, and (dare I say it?) intelligence.</p>
<p>Everybody who&rsquo;s studied human intelligence is fully aware that Northeast Asians outscore Caucasians by about six IQ points on average.  They&rsquo;re equally aware that black Africans, on average, score fifteen to twenty points lower than Caucasions.  Of course, to acknowledge these facts is a de facto criminal offense in the US at this point, proving once again that there is nothing so hotly denied in this world as an unpleasant but totally self-evident truth.  </p>
<p>Does this mean that blacks can&rsquo;t lead productive and fulfilling lives among people of other races?  Not at all. But it does mean that they can&rsquo;t lay all their failures and lack of achievement at the feet of others, as they&rsquo;re now instructed to do by soft-headed and often cowardly whites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as though a parent taught his kids that their failure to achieve any of their goals in life, however fanciful, will be the fault of powerful and evil forces beyond their control, that if they fail to become nuclear physicists, brain surgeons, or big league baseball stars it&rsquo;s not because they lacked the ability or talent, but rather that they&rsquo;d been deprived of success by evil people somehow manipulating the levers of power.<br/>
Blacks are taught, often by stupid whites, that the levers of power are being manipulated by evil whites. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a most comforting but destructive thought.</p>

		<p>One good response to the boring old &#8216;you&rsquo;re a racist&rsquo; accusation, is to reply,</p>
<p>Well, if I&rsquo;m a racist then you&rsquo;re an anti-White racist.</p>
<p>An automatic demand to know &#8216;how come&rsquo; will usually follow, </p>
<p>to which one should reply </p>
<p><i>because <b>you</b> prefer your own kind to White people which means <b>you</b> hate all White people.</i> </p>
<p>(This sort of illogical rationale is used to label White people as racists so one must use it back.)</p>
<p>Alternatively, one could retort</p>
<p><i>if <b>you</b> feel more empathy with and allegiance to your own race instead of White people that makes <b>you</b> a racist <b>against White people.</b></i></p>
<p>Should the response be that tiresome old anti-White Marxist one-liner, ie,<br/>
 <br/>
Blacks can&rsquo;t be racist towards White people, </p>
<p>one then asks them what they think they&rsquo;re being if not racist.</p>
<p>Whatever they reply is going to show them up as infantile and, therefore, mentally immature - a point one <b>must not</b> fail to drive home immediately. <br/>

		<p>I think the goal for a lot of us who read and comment here at AmRen is for a legitimate mass movement to arise where white people can organize and advocate for white interests.</p>
<p>My question to you folks is: does this move by the NAACP hurt or help that cause? </p>
<p>How many times can you yell at and harangue an implicitly white organization before they say, &#8220;hey, maybe there IS something to this race stuff. Maybe the NAACP is coming after us because we&rsquo;re white, and they don&rsquo;t like to see white people organizing. So maybe we should organize as white people.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems to me that every time an implicitly white organization gets &#8220;called out&#8221; for being racist two possible things can happen: The group of whites can cower, protest their innocence and allow themselves to be bullied into changing their supposed &#8220;racist&#8221; behavior.</p>
<p>Or they can raise their heads and recognize that yes, they&rsquo;re basically a white organization and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. Lots of good stuff could follow from such a realization.</p>
<p>I guess I see the NAACP&rsquo;s attack on the Tea Party movement as having the potential to wake up the racial awareness of some whites in that movement. But I&rsquo;m not very familiar with the Tea Party movement so perhaps others here can tell me what the reaction inside the movement is.</p>

		<p>The word &#8220;racist&#8221; is used too frequently in the United States.  There needs to be a term that clearly distinguishes between someone like Charles Murray and a bar room bigot who bores the regulars by getting drunk and grumbling about how much he hates blacks, Jews, or some other minority.  </p>

		<p>In response to a couple of you who brought up the idea that maybe it&rsquo;s time for a White advocacy group, I think it&rsquo;s not only time, it&rsquo;s overdue.  I&rsquo;ve seen the need for this for a long time, but never felt there was any organization out there that had potential in terms of bringing together those of us in the AR stratum and those of shall we say, the less savory layers of discontented Whites.  Duke tried to remake the K into something more respectable and God bless him for his efforts.  I think would needs to be done is something that has no history, no tainted leader and no defined platform beyond promoting and protecting the interests of Whites.  Maybe something with an innocuous title like, Coalition For European-Americans.  That doesn&rsquo;t sound nearly as racist as, LARAZA or NAACP or Black Caucus.  The CEA could act as a hub in a wheel, with all the other little fiefdoms like AR, CofCC, and others I won&rsquo;t mention, acting as the spokes in the big wheel.  Nobody steps on anyone else&rsquo;s toes or suffers for anyone elses missteps, but we all roll together.  I don&rsquo;t know.  Does that sound possible?  I think so.</p>
