<h1>Professor at Historically Black College Questions &#8216;Black National Anthem&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Liane Membis, CNN, July 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;Lift Every Voice and Sing&#8221; is an uplifting spiritual, one that&rsquo;s often heard in churches and popularly recognized as the black national anthem. Timothy Askew [an associate professor of English at Clark Atlanta University, a historically black college] grew up with its rhythms, but now the song holds a contentious place in his mind.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Askew explains his position in the new book, &#8220;Cultural Hegemony and African American Patriotism: An Analysis of the Song, &#8216;Lift Every Voice and Sing,&rsquo;&#8221; which was released by Linus Publications in June. The book explores the literary and musical traditions of the song, but also says that a national anthem for African-Americans can be construed as racially separatist and divisive.</p>
<p>&#8220;To sing the &#8216;black national anthem&rsquo; suggests that black people are separatist and want to have their own nation,&#8221; Askew said. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some will call his perspective on the song a contradiction, Askew said, especially because he works at a historically black college. But he argues that universities like Clark Atlanta accept students of many races and ethnicities; a national anthem for one race excludes others, and ignores an existing national anthem, &#8220;The Star-Spangled Banner&#8221; by Francis Scott Key.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What troubles Askew more is that the song became an identity marker for African-Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who has the right to decide for all black people what racial symbol they should have?&#8221; Askew said. &#8220;Identity should be developed by the individual himself, not a group of people who think they know what is best for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hilary O. Shelton, senior vice president for advocacy and policy for the NAACP, said Askew&rsquo;s ideas might be far-fetched.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t see anything that is racially exclusive or discriminatory about the song,&#8221; Shelton said. &#8220;The negro national anthem was adopted and welcomed by a very interracial group, and it speaks of hope in being full first-class citizens in our society.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that we often try to separate the black experience from the American experience,&#8221; said Marc Lamont Hill, an associate professor of education at Columbia University who studies hip-hop culture. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a black national anthem, but it&rsquo;s also a quintessential American song because of its message of fighting for freedom. It&rsquo;s not &#8216;lift the black voices,&rsquo; it&rsquo;s &#8216;lift every voice.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Askew, though, maintains there&rsquo;s only one national anthem, &#8220;The Star-Spangled Banner,&#8221; and that &#8220;Lift Every Voice and Sing&#8221; could take on a new role: a message of victory for all ethnic groups in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to consider eliminating this alternative label of &#8216;black national anthem&rsquo; in order to promote unity,&#8221; Askew said. &#8220;I know people will probably think that I&rsquo;m a sellout, but I think it is important that African-Americans nationally understand that we should be moving towards racial cohesiveness.&#8221;<br>

Well jump&rsquo;n hot dang! Who knew that my favorite new song would be the black national anthem!  Lordy, strange times make a strange man!</p>
<p>In honor of Booker T. Washington, Henry McNeal Turner, and Marcus Garvey, please join me in a rousing singing of their song of  RACE SEPARATION!  </p>

		<p>Better &#8220;Lift Every Voice and Sing&#8221; than I song I heard blasting from a ghettoized SUV about seven to eight years ago in a mall parking lot   &mdash;   The only lyrics I could make out are, &#8220;I want to hate and kill the m  &mdash;    &mdash;  rf  &mdash;    &mdash;  -g white police,&#8221; &#8220;The g-dd  &mdash;    &mdash;  d&#8221; police,&#8221; in between screaming and malodorous rain forest drum beats.  I tried to reverse search the lyrics to find the &#8220;artist&#8221; to no avail   &mdash;   probably an underground-cut song.  However, there is an old time rap group from the olden days called NWA (N  &mdash;    &mdash;  -s With Attitude), its most famous member was O&rsquo;Shea &#8220;Ice Cube&#8221; Jackson   &mdash;   One of their first songs was &#8220;F  &mdash;  - The Police.&#8221;</p>
<p>Count your blessings.</p>

More marxist nonsense.  Race, genetics, family, religion, language, culture all are part of forming one&rsquo;s identity but are neither picked by nor imposed upon an individual.  Society is dynamic and self organizing.  Humans are tribal. That means distinct, but not necessarily in conflict nor isolated.  Marxists would have us believe that the human mind is a blank slate, to be molded into by an all powerful elite into identical obedient sheep.</p>
<p>Do you think any of Askew&rsquo;s black students ever decided to be a Hasidic Jew?<br>

Are you serious?  Does he have an associate who is a professor of redneck studies?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve endured this remarkably untuneful song as the token white guy at several black functions. It&rsquo;s a bit self-pitying, but there&rsquo;s nothing about it that sounds separatist. It&rsquo;s about overcoming the past and living a good life in the future, here in America. </p>
<p>Probably they ought to refer to it as something other than the Black National Anthem, though.</p>

		<p>I actually think the &#8216;Black National Anthem&rsquo; is a good idea. The more distance there is between the races, the better it is. I also support Muslim women wearing burkhas,  La Raza etc&hellip; The non-Whites with their racist and hateful actions are doing their part in destroying the chances of a multiracial multi-cultural one world  so loved by the elites.</p>

<p>The blacks already have their own nation/S, they are all in Africa&hellip;Even Liberia is a country formed by and for slaves, and we all know how well that works for them. They have smaller nations in the U.S. and we call those Big American Cities.</p>

		<p>I think this sort of thing should be encouraged.  If they say &#8220;We are not Americans&#8221; long enough, the rest of us will eventually agree with them.  As Mr. Chittum said in his book, &#8220;Civil War Two&#8221; they then &#8220;&hellip;may be assigned a category totally consistant with the Western, Clausewitzian concept of total war.&#8221;</p>
