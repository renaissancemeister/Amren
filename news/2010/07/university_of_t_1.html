<h1>University of Texas at Austin President Will Propose Removal of Simkins Name from Residence Hall</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, University of Texas, July 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>AUSTIN, Texas  &mdash;  William Powers Jr., president of The University of Texas at Austin, will propose to the University of Texas System Board of Regents the removal of the name from the university&rsquo;s Simkins Residence Hall, endorsing a recommendation by a 21-member advisory group, it was announced today (July 9).</p>
<p>&#8220;I accept and endorse the recommendation of the advisory group, and I will seek the approval of the Board of Regents for removal of the name from the residence hall,&#8221; said Powers. &#8220;I value and appreciate the consultative process that led to this decision and the engagement of the community, students, faculty, staff and alumni in this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Powers will propose renaming the residence hall and adjacent park Creekside Dormitory and Creekside Park at the July 15 meeting of the Board of Regents, which must approve the action.</p>
<p>The hall, which was built in the 1950s to house male law students and graduate students, was named for William Stewart Simkins, who taught at the School of Law from 1899 until his death in 1929. Simkins had ties to the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) after the Civil War.</p>
<p>&#8220;The university&rsquo;s current naming policy addresses renaming in cases when the name compromises public trust and the university&rsquo;s reputation,&#8221; said Dr. Gregory J. Vincent, vice president for diversity and engagement, who formed the advisory group at Powers&rsquo; request. &#8220;In light of these guidelines, the advisory group strongly believes that renaming is the proper course of action. By his own admission, Simkins engaged in violent behavior against African Americans. These were actions taken outside of the law. Furthermore, Simkins wrote and spoke freely about these activities during his 30-year tenure at the university, promoting the Klan to students and others on campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;The group also believed that having a residence hall honorifically named for a founder of the Florida KKK is inconsistent with the core values of this university and with President Powers&rsquo; strategic goal to increase diversity on campus. During the past four years, we have made significant progress diversifying the faculty, staff and student body and creating an inclusive campus climate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The advisory group deliberated during a series of four meetings held in June and gathered input through an e-mail address and two public forums co-sponsored by the Student Government.</p>
<p>&#8220;An institution like ours is shaped by its history, but it need not be encumbered by it,&#8221; Powers said. &#8220;While reflecting on the past and learning from it, it is important to focus on the future. The University of Texas at Austin is now among the most diverse institutions of higher education in the nation, and we will continue to invest in ensuring this is a place of opportunity for young people from all racial, ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If they want to remove &#8216;racist names&rsquo; on public streets and buildings, they should start with Malcolm X, Santa Anna, Paul Robeson, etc. That is when they are not busy recommending these very names be used as often as possible.  </p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re good a digging up long dead whites with ties to groups like the K, but we can&rsquo;t get any traction on the extant of a preacher who preaches anti-white doctrine, or the Attorney General, who disregards anti-white activity by an anti-white organization (New Black Panthers) or his and other appointments of anti-whites by a President whose sentiments are betrayed on nearly a daily basis.</p>
<p>Such hypocrisy cannot go unnoticed for long.  In fact, this may be partly why Obama&rsquo;s numbers are slipping.</p>

		<p>My question is this: if there were a student named Simkins, would they be expelled?</p>

		<p>Each Egyptian dynasty defaced the statues of the preceding, and the Taliban blew up the ancient monuments to Buddha.  Civilized folks regard vandalism of the past to be barbaric.  Today, it is simply Politically Correct.</p>

		<p>To hold our ancestors to the standards of today is not only incredibly ignorant, it is disrespectful  &mdash;  it is our ancestors who made this country, created its institutions, pushed science and technology and business forward  &mdash;  who are we to second guess their choices? And to be a little unkind  &mdash;  what have the people who object to Simkins Hall created? what did their ancestors create? I think the answer is obvious, and I wish only that it was obvious to them.</p>
