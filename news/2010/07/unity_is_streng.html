<h1>Unity Is Strength: Spain Wins the World Cup</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Kowalski, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> July 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The World Cup is easily the most popular sporting event on the planet and for the second time in a row a team comprised entirely of indigenous Europeans has come out on top. On Sunday, Spain proved itself the best team in the world by beating the Netherlands 1-0. The World Cup is held every four years. In 2006, Italy took home its fourth cup.</p>
<p>Not only were the championship teams from Spain and Italy all-white, they were, respectively, all-Spanish and all-Italian. Those not familiar with soccer might wonder why this is noteworthy. In fact, it is a huge blow to the anti-white forces that are changing the face of Europe.</p>
<p>Last month, I wrote an article for <cite>Alternative Right</cite> (available  <a href="https://www.alternativeright.com/main/blogs/zeitgeist/black-men-can-t-kick/" target="article" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here</b></a>) focusing on the racial makeup of the 32 teams from around the globe who qualified for this year&rsquo;s tournament. (There are regional quotas, otherwise the World Cup would be mainly a competition between European and South American teams.) Despite all the happy talk about multiculturalism and diversity, most of the planet is represented by teams that represent the demographics of their individual nations. African, Asian, and Eastern European squads were all racially uniform. The teams from Latin America tended to match their populations as a whole so that Uruguay and Argentina were mostly white, Mexico was mostly mestizo and Brazil mostly black and racially mixed with a few whites.</p>
<p>Western European teams, however, have been darkening for the last few decades. This is most obvious in the case of France. The French won their only World Cup in 1998 with a squad starting seven whites and four blacks. Now the team regularly starts seven or eight blacks. The under-21 team consists of 15 blacks and 5 whites. England, unfortunately, has been sliding down the same path as France. They started five or six blacks for most matches in the World Cup and their under-21 side is less than half white.</p>
<p>The French national soccer team no longer represents the French people and England seems to be on the same track. Even second-tier teams such as Switzerland started two blacks. Of course, only white nations are faced with this situation, as they are the only countries that let in masses of people of different races. Asians and Africans will probably never come close to winning a World Cup, but they will always be able to cheer for teams that look like them.</p>
<p>Just because a national team goes black, however, doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t go back. In the 1990s, the Dutch national squad was easily the &#8220;blackest&#8221; of the European teams and seemed to be getting worse by the year. But this year the Dutch usually started nine whites and two mulattoes. In their semifinal game they actually started no blacks at all. Few would have predicted this a few years ago but the Netherlands team actually looked more or less Dutch  &mdash;  and they were rewarded with a second-place finish.</p>
<p>So how did the French squad fare? The team bombed out with a 0-2-1 record and couldn&rsquo;t even make the second round of the tournament. The squad was beset with squabbling that seemed to have racial undertones. After a black starter, Nicolas Anelka, was suspended by the white coach, Raymond Domenech, the players decided to protest by refusing to practice. The team took a vote that reportedly broke down along racial lines  &mdash;  with most of the whites voting to continue practice.</p>
<p>Yoann Gourcuff is a true Frenchman and one of the most promising young French players but he inexplicably didn&rsquo;t start this year. The French soccer website ChezlesGirondins.com reported that the black players derisively referred to him as &#8220;la Nouvelle Star,&#8221; and that Gourcuff almost came to blows with black player Patrice Evra after harassment at the hands of Evra. Though born in Senegal, Evra is  &mdash;  quite fittingly  &mdash;  the captain of the French team.</p>
<p>In contrast to the French, Spain started a team of 11 Spaniards and took home the World Cup  &mdash;  just as Italy did with 11 Italians in 2006. Perhaps the obvious lessons will not be lost on those who select the national teams of other European nations.</p>

		<p> Viva Espana! Being of north-northwest European descent myself, I would have preferred to see the Dutch win, but it&rsquo;s great to see an all-Caucasian team take home all the marbles, nevertheless.</p>
<p> It&rsquo;s also interesting that in the American NBA, the small increase in outstanding White players of recent years has been mostly of European athletes, or of ones from White nations in Latin America, specifically Argentina. It&rsquo;s not that White Americans couldn&rsquo;t compete in the NBA   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s that this notion that &#8220;White basketball player&#8221; equals &#8220;role player&#8221;, or, more often, &#8220;bench sitter&#8221;   &mdash;   has become holy writ among so many coaches. White youngsters are not encouraged to go out for basketball any more, because they know they won&rsquo;t get a fair shake. </p>

		<p>I counted at least four blacks on the German team.  The Dutch had two &#8220;real&#8221; blacks and one mulatto.  Coincidentally, the Dutch team seemed to play thuggish soccer, almost as if you were watching a University of Miami football game in the 1980s.</p>

		<p>I agree but weren&rsquo;t here and elsewhere commentators displaying Mediterraneans in general (Spaniards,Portuguese, Greeeks etc)  as lessen (mixed, therefore inferior) whites? In other word, what is precisely being &#8220;white&#8221;? </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why you think Asians will never win.<br>
Football is about team play. You don&rsquo;t need necessarily good individual player but a team in which the one fights if another made a mistake and helps him out. And this is actually what Spain did as well as what the Italians did last match.<br>
We in Germany have one Turkish player who made mistakes, but he didn&rsquo;t fought hard so the others didn&rsquo;t fought for his mistakes too. That&rsquo;s why we lost one ball after another. </p>
<p>Solidarity is the key to win a match.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s great for Spain, but let&rsquo;s be honest about something: The massive crime and disorder which many predicted would occur during the World Cup did not occur. While I have no direct info, nothing was reported in the MSM or any other source that I accessed. I assume therefore that the SA government was able to keep a lid on the population in visible areas. I give credit where credit is due, and in South Africa this deserves credit.</p>

		<p>Spain was, ultimately, the best team. World Cup 2010 was not the most exciting as far as playing styles go. But it was heartening to see a national team composed primarily of white fellow countrymen win the trophy. <br>
   Personally, I was glad to see Brazil get knocked out by Holland. I viewed the last 20 minutes of that game on a large screen tv in a lounge area of the major university where I work. Most of students (many of whom came from south of the border) were pulling for Brazil, of course. So, at the final whistle, I laughingly said,&#8221;They&rsquo;ll be smokin&rsquo; in Amsterdam tonight!&#8221; Wow! The looks I got&hellip;</p>

		<p>In the final, over the course of the game, the Dutch played two blacks, two mulattoes, and two mixed Indonesian players.  </p>
<p>The overall picture for Western European soccer is looking bad, as the youth teams are less white than the adult teams.  Also, there are many Turkish and Albanian players on teams like Germany and Switzerland.  Germany this year played two turks, two blacks and a mulatto.  </p>

<p>As the author of the article says, the French team did not represent the French.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, any team with Blacks on it only represents some portion of Africa, not Europe.</p>

		<p>To tell you the truth, if France had wound up playing Ghana for the championship I would have wanted Ghana to win. At least all the players who represent that country are authentic.</p>
<p>It disappoints me to read how many of the sub-21 players for England are now non-white. It looks like England is rapidly moving towards the French model.</p>
<p>In my case, having lived in Argentina for so many years, I supported the national selection from there. There are several players with Italian last names on the team. One of my favorite sayings I recall about residents of Buenos Aires is that &#8220;an Argentine is a person with an Italian last name who speaks Spanish and thinks he&rsquo;s English.&#8221; (This last is due to the strong British influence in the country historically)</p>

		<p>A few points of fact:</p>
<p>The &#8220;all-white&#8221; Italians may have won in 2006, but they were one of the biggest disappointments of this year&rsquo;s championships, failing at the first stage (just like the French). Sometimes all-white teams do well. Sometimes they&rsquo;re terrible.</p>
<p>The Dutch may have fielded no &#8220;blacks&#8221; in the semifinal, but throughout the tournament they were captained by Giovanni van Bronckhorst, who is of Indonesian and Moluccan ethnicity. </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting you fail to mention the third-place German squad, which included mainly young players of Polish, Turkish, Tunisian, Nigerian, Brazilian and Ghanaian backgrounds, and is tipped for even greater things in 2014.</p>
<p>Although the Spanish football team may have pulled together, the country itself is moving in the opposite direction, as the various regions find that cultural, linguistic and political differences are more important than any shared &#8220;Spanish&#8221; ethnicity. Many of them are more likely to identify with the autonomous region of Catalonia than with the Kingdom of Spain. </p>
<p>Still, interesting to see an AmRen writer sticking up for a bunch of Hispanics for once!</p>

		<p>Actually many Spanish have semitic or Arab blood in them. In the traditional white-racial homogenous sense, I don&rsquo;t know how far I could call them pure-white. Eg: Xavi, descended from Moors ( Jersey # 8 ): a star player who was vital to the  team&rsquo;s success.<br>
Infact, Germany or Holland would be considered more white by comparison. Also, Spain did have a black player in their winning team - not pictured here.</p>

		<p>I now claim the right to be the first person on the planet to dare tell the truth behind soccer`s apparent love affair with white America. Soccer is the only game that upper middle class white kids from the suburbs can play. Hispanics  have taken over baseball; blacks own basketball, and ghetto thugs run football from high school to the NFL. Of course there is always  swimming, tennis, and wrestling, sports that require small teams and athletic skill whuich leaves about 95% of white folks lacking. Mrs. White Suburbia can drive little Johnny to the soccer field and not worry about being car jacked or a vicitm of a drive by. Go to any socer field and watch the mothers in the stands. They all are wearing desginer jeans and it looks like a meeting of the Junior League. Soccer is just another sad sign of the corruption of the blood of our nation.<br>

<p>&#8220;A few points of fact:</p>
<p>The &ldquo;all-white&rdquo; Italians may have won in 2006, but they were one of the biggest disappointments of this year&rsquo;s championships, failing at the first stage (just like the French). Sometimes all-white teams do well. Sometimes they&rsquo;re terrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course teams will have up and down years. But at least the Italians were able to cheer for Italians just like Nigerians were able to cheer for Nigerians. Who did real French people get to cheer for? And would you rather be Italy with 4 World Cups or some pathetic African side who will never win a World Cup.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Dutch may have fielded no &ldquo;blacks&rdquo; in the semifinal, but throughout the tournament they were captained by Giovanni van Bronckhorst, who is of Indonesian and Moluccan ethnicity.&#8221;</p>
<p>When people who are part Indonesian and Moluccan start to replace white Europeans on national teams then we will worry.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&rsquo;s interesting you fail to mention the third-place German squad, which included mainly young players of Polish, Turkish, Tunisian, Nigerian, Brazilian and Ghanaian backgrounds, and is tipped for even greater things in 2014.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team was still overwhelmingly German and 8 of the 11 starters were white. Would have been 9 if Michael Ballach was not injured. Plus, the German under 21 team contains 42 whites and 3 blacks. Germany is indeed tipped for greater things in 2014 and has a very bright future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the Spanish football team may have pulled together, the country itself is moving in the opposite direction, as the various regions find that cultural, linguistic and political differences are more important than any shared &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; ethnicity. Many of them are more likely to identify with the autonomous region of Catalonia than with the Kingdom of Spain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe not. Spain has been like this for a long time and are still together. But they will have soccer teams that look like thier own people no matter what.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, interesting to see an AmRen writer sticking up for a bunch of Hispanics for once!&#8221;</p>
<p>You should read AR more often! Spain is a great European nation full of great and talented white people. Glad to see that you admire us.<br>

		<p>&#8220;In the final, over the course of the game, the Dutch played two blacks, two mulattoes, and two mixed Indonesian players.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, but not all at one time. So the Dutch team always had 8 true Dutch on the field. And the black players were terrible and didn&rsquo;t add one goal the whole tournament for Holland.</p>
<p>Same with the Germans. Cacau was a reserve and is 33 so will be gone next time. Boateng was a huge disappointment and added nothing. May he play for his native Ghana next time. The German under 21 team is almost all white so they should expect good results in 2014.</p>

		<p>Well now if you want to watch a 99% all-white event watch the Tour De France. It is nice to see no blacks on bikes, in a highly demanding, competitive sport. Save for a couple of Japanese and sometimes Colombian riders (although Santiago Botero a former Colombian rider is whiter than many posters here) Le Tour is a great sporting event and it is refreshing to see no thuggery, tattoos and blacks crying racism because the climbs are too steep for their physical abilities.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I wait with bated breath for an afro idiot to show up and tell us that the Moors were black Africans and they dominated Spain for hundreds of year and mixed with the Spaniards - ergo : the Spanish only won because of their black genetics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, North Africans were white prior to the spread of Islam and mixture with African slaves taken by the muslims who were then freed to mix with the population once they had been converted to Islam. Excepting the Egyptian situation, of course, which is more complicated (the afro-centrist position is still wrong, as usual).</p>

		<p>In South Africa we&rsquo;ve seen the same effect take place. Sports dominated by whites, excell in international competition. In spite of government&rsquo;s best (and worst) efforts, rugby is still pretty much a white sport. The Springboks have a winning record against all teams taking part in the World Cup and have won it twice, a winning record of 50%, unparalleled by any other nation. Although a number of black players have made their mark in rugby, an all-star team, chosen from Springboks in the years 1992-2010, only one black player will make the grade - Bryan Habana, the left winger.<br>
South Africa has also performed very well in cricket, once again very much a white sport. It is currently rated as the best test-playing nation. Not one black will make the all-star team.<br>
South African soccer, in contrast, is a black sport, most often without any white players. The sport is in shambles. South Africa has only once won an African Nations&rsquo;Cup, and that was in 1996, with a white coach, (Clive Barker,) and a white captain, (Neil Tovey.) <br>
This is the first time since 1966 that the Soccer World Cup did not alternate between South America and Europe. Worldwide the shift in sports is towards teams populated, coached and managed by White people. There&rsquo;s a happy thought, if only for imagining how sickening this must be to liberals all over the world.</p>

		<p>I am studying in Europe now. I have a beautiful, light haired, blue-eyed, well-mannered young Spanish lady in my class. My roomate is from Padua, a very talented, young, curly burnette haired, olive-skinned Physcist. I have a bright blue-eyed, fair-skinned Greek young lady friend in a nearby town.</p>
<p>Get it?</p>
<p>Of course there is some Arab blood in Italy, Spain and the Balkans. But this is not equally distributed and NOT the majority of these nations. Of course, us Nothern Europeans are different than our Southern brothers, but we are in the same family. Fighting amongst ourselves will do no good. I dare anyone here to meet the typical Spaniard and resist smiling. They have a lot warmer peronailty than us Northerners.</p>
<p>Yes, Spain has some trouble with the different ethnicities. But I can assure you everyone of them was celebrating their victory, which they achieved together. So what? Germany is made up of 16 different states, almost all are former ethnic kingdoms. The Prussians do not like the Bavarians, etc. But the dislike is more like familial rivalry. The family stays together. This is one thing the Europeans and European dispora can do that other races cannot. Think of the Kurds in the Middle East. The Tutsi in Africa. </p>
<p>As for America, I feel the same familial bond to my American kin. Were a State to succeed, I would feel a sense of loss and isolation from my fellow kin. (At the same time, I would feel overjoyed that my kin had escaped the oppresion of the Federal Government and hope to join them). </p>
<p>Despite our regional differences, REAL (European) Americans will always feel a bond to one another. I believe the Renaissance is coming soon. <br>

<p>&#8220;Colombian team robbed from their Sandton hotel rooms</p>
<p>Journos from Portugal and Spain robbed at Randburg lodge</p>
<p>Chinese camera crew robbed at gunpoint outside Soccer City</p>

<p>Greek players robbed from their Beverley Hills hotel</p>
<p>11 Foreign tourists robbed while visiting Cape Wine Estate</p>
<p>Uruguay team robbed of over R90,000 by hotel staff member</p>
<p>Chilean soccer fan robbed at hotel in Mpumalanga, held up at gunpoint</p>
<p>A spate of armed attacks and robberies against foreign World Cup visitors have been reported and the numbers are increasing exponentially&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2cl2mbe" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2cl2mbe</a></p>
<p>When I did a Google search of &#8216;Crime in SA during the World Cup&rsquo;, nine out of the 12 suggested sites stated that crime had dropped during the World Cup.</p>
<p>Whether crime dropped or not during the World Cup,  Whites are still set upon by african blacks, targeted for brutal torture and murder:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Since the election of Nelson Mandela in 1994, farmers&rsquo; organisations say 3,000 whites in rural areas have been killed&hellip;.the majority of attacks in general are against white people and that &#8216;there was a considerably higher risk of a white victim of farm attacks being killed or injured than a black victim.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Farmer murders have jumped by 25 per cent since 2006.</p>
<p>The ANC government&rsquo;s response to this has been largely defiant. As Charles Ngacula, Safety and Security Minister under the previous administration of Thabo Mbeki, said: &#8216;They can continue to whinge until they&rsquo;re blue in the face, be as negative as they want to, or they can simply leave this country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Black youth leaders in South Africa are promising to rape Whites and &#8216;burn white children.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/meo4pp" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/meo4pp</a></p>
<p>Now that the TV cameras and tourists are heading home and attention is off of SA, many Whites in SA believe the brutal attacks will escalate.</p>

<p>Second, the picture is old, check for &#8220;spanish team South Africa&#8221; on google. Senna, the black player is no longer on the national team. However, I respect him, he&rsquo;s a great player.</p>
<p>Third, moor blood? maybe, but that happened long time ago. The Kings kicked out the jews and moors in 1492.  </p>
<p>Third, Holland played thuggish as hell, check for this kick in the chest of a spanish player, the dutch player should have left the field inmediately<br>

<p>&#8220;A few points of fact:&#8221;</p>
<p>I always enjoy how so many posters present their projections and assumptions as facts.</p>
<p>And then,</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, interesting to see an AmRen writer sticking up for a bunch of Hispanics for once!&#8221;</p>
<p>This is how and why semantics are so important.  The reason &#8220;Latin&#8221;  was attached to South America was because in the time it was done, The Catholic Church was calling itself &#8220;The Latin Church,&#8221; and since it was virtually 100% conquered and dominated by the Roman Catholic Church, it was named Latin America to differentiate it from the more Protestant Northern Hemisphere of the New World.  In time, by the 1940s, Latin Americans came to be called Latins, although the real Latins were in Northern Italy and often blue eyed blondes.  Their Etruscan forebearers were certainly a Celtic tribe.  Another reason for the use of the term &#8220;Latin&#8221; for the Indigenous Catholics of Mexico and south was a funny little bit of history that few make note of;  Ladino is the name of the language that Spanish Jews spoke very early on.  A deep history read sees them settled on the Southern Coast of Spain during the Roman era.  Jews often were the suppliers of materials and food to the Roman Army, and they went with them all the way to Britain.  Early in the settlement of the Southwest, particularly the South Texa region, Sephardic (Spanish) Jews set up a colony.  I am not clear as I write this, if they were by then Crypto Jews, but they probably were since the purge and forced conversions began in 1492, the same year Columbus sailed.  It is well known that there were several Jews on the voyage and the entire venture was financed by a Jewish banker who happened to service Queen Isabella as well.  It is my guess that the word &#8220;Latino&#8221; has its example in the Ladino language.  The typical usurpative style of Hispanics follows here, so I suspect this true.  As for &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; - I know of no Spaniard who call themselves Hispanics, it seems reserved for New World pretenders.  I have even heard Mexicans parlay the Latin claim into a claim to be related to the French, something I find particularly repugnant.  But it is merely a continuance of the method of pretention.</p>
<p>While it is true that some Mexicans have come to Spain, they do not amount to many.  Therefore, Hispanic is not a fitting apellation for a Spaniard.  But &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; - the word itself was created to cause this very confusion.  The more appropriate word for Mestizoes and Indigenous members of the Nations south of the southern U.S. border might be &#8220;Hispanoid,&#8221; which means &#8220;resembling a Hispanic.  This would do because the dominant culture and religion of these nations is Spanish based and the religion Catholic, which was clearly inserted forcibly into those same nations.  But this will never make a member of those nations a Spaniard or European, even thogh there have been German and other more modern European conclaves established here and there, usually on the Eastern seaboard.  Enough that some Nazis found community in places like Brazil and Argentina after WW2.</p>
<p>I may be straining myself and the reader to make my point, but this poster is straining language to make a false analogy.<br>

<p>I am sick of how articles like this ( no matter how positive) always generate so many negative comments from people.  Either &#8220;this is too little too late&#8221; or &#8220;it won&rsquo;t be that way for long&#8221;&hellip;yada yada yada.</p>

<p>And on a final note, what is with all this garbage about Moorish blood in Spain, and whether or not the Moors were white?  I don&rsquo;t understand why so many people on here consider people who are native to the Middle East &#8220;white&#8221;, and the only circumstances that you don&rsquo;t consider them &#8220;white&#8221; is always because &#8220;they might have African slave blood&#8221;.  Have you looked at the pictures of the Spanish players?  Almost all of them have blue eyes, and they hardly look &#8220;arab&#8221; or what not.</p>

<p>I was in the high school marching band, and we participated in competitions and the like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 20 years since I started senior year, but as I recall, my band was probably 95% white, and this was a Detroit suburb.</p>
<p>I remember one time we were at a competition, and we watched a band from another suburb  &mdash;  and most, if not all, of them were black.  Their marching was pretty lousy.  They tried to cover for that, apparently, by doing a dance to &#8220;Hanging Tough&#8221; by New Kids on the Block.  I still chuckle at the memory of these huge black guys with bass drums swaying and beating away.</p>
<p>Needless to say, they finished last, or pretty close to it.  Keep in mind that this was mid-1980s.</p>

<p>Now they come from all over the world. They are only in it for the money and fame, not local pride, and move on when a better offer comes in. They have no loyalty. </p>
<p>So, what are people in fact supporting? A strip, a set of team colours? Or just supporting a team that wins more than it loses and makes supporters feel good about themselves as the bask in reflected glory.</p>
<p>Pathetic isn&rsquo;t it.  </p>

		<p>How long until they force &#8220;diversification&#8221; upon the remaining white teams? </p>
<p>Not long ago Germany had an all white team but for a long time one could hear lamentations in the media that this would not reflect our &#8220;diverse society&#8221; – and everybody who even only very slightly hinted that there are too many Non-Europeans in the leagues was yelled down and called a Nazi. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way it works here – dissent is impossible. You will face hysteria and maybe violence. Always tagged as &#8220;tolerance&#8221;.</p>

<p>Could you imagine some west Indian team cheering for a team over run with whites? We used to have a black newsreader called Trevor McDonald: well dressed English gentleman.

<p>There is indeed French blood in some parts of Mexico.  Many soldiers came and simply decided to never leave, thus intermingling with some of the local population.  There are entire regions in Mexico where the local population are white, dark-haired, and blue &amp; green-eyed who have French ancestry.  </p>
<p>The reason you don&rsquo;t hear about it is likely because these people do not have the same propagandist tendencies as oh, say the English do.  They are too busy living the good life in their beautiful corners of Mexico to bother.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we here in America don&rsquo;t see these people because they have no reason to leave Mexico.  Instead, we get the underclass, of indigenous origin.</p>

Hey - McGonagass #26<br>
- - These men are Castillian Spanish. They are NOT &ldquo;Hispanics&rdquo;. Someone needs to tell you the difference. These are White men. They&rsquo;re not the Hispanic trash that you see here in America from PR, Mexico, Guatemala, The Dominican Republic and all the other Banana Republics. <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
It is upsetting to read so much mis-information here!  I went back and re-read McGonagall&rsquo;s post, several times, and found nothing  wrong with it. He also demonstrates a  goodknowledge of present political circumstances in Spain.</p>
<p>In fact, &#8220;these men&#8221; (the team)   are BOTH  Spanish and Hispanic (no difference), and they are almost certainly not all Castillians.</p>
<p>McG. took a lot of abuse here for his use of the word &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;. That&rsquo;s rubbish. For those who don&rsquo;t know, &#8220;Hispania&#8221; is simply the Latin name for Spain. Thus, any Spaniard is Hispanic.  (Just as any Swiss is Helvetic.)   In the USA, however, it has come to be used mainly to descibe persons from the former Spanish colonies, since those are the ones we are most  accstomer to dealing with. After all, we have zillions of Mexicans and Dominicans, but very few Spaniards here. And those Spaniards that we have fit right in among us and are undistinguishable from other Europeans.</p>
<p>PS. I&rsquo;m not sure  how many of that crew are &#8220;Castilian&#8221; Spaniards. Probably a lot of them are not Castillians. Carlos could tell us better about that (and he&rsquo;s not Castillian either). You don&rsquo;t have to be Castillian to be Spanish. Even Colombus wasn&rsquo;t a Castillian.<br>

<p>I also sympathized with the post from Mike/notQueens, what I could understand of it.</p>
<p>#54 Anon. is absolutely right that there are French descendents in Mexico.  Quite a few. There is even an organization of them.Some of them became very rich. In fact, the discoverer of the fabulous silver mines at Taxco came from the small French town of Barcelonnette, high in the Alps. That was Joseph de la Borde  (Jose de la Borda) who came to Taxco in 1716. His find made him fabulously wealthy,  the richest man in New Spain and the New World.</p>
<p> &#8220;The city and region around have been the center of a French emigration wave to the Americas (mostly Mexico) in the late 19th and early beginning 20th centuries. Families which had prospered abroad came back and built the huge mansions that one can see all over the town called Maisons Mexicaines [Mexican houses]. The construction of such mansions took place primarily from 1880 to 1930. Today, a large community of Barcelonettes live in Mexico City, San Luis Potosí and Puebla, Mexico. The most famous of these descendants is the Mexican comedian Eugenio Derbez and the Jazz composer and writer Alain Derbez.&#8221; <a href="https://tinyurl.com/36j4lsh" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/36j4lsh</a><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>There is endless speculation and bickering  here about the meaning of  <b>&#8220;Latin American&#8221;. </b>  Napoleon invented the term  &#8220;Latin America&#8221; as a propaganda device in his world-wide  war against Great Britain.  At a time when Napoleon occupied Spain, the Spanish royal family had fled to England, and the British fleet had assumed the defense of the Spanish colonies in the New World,  the term was designed to win sympathy for Napoloen  in South America by apealing to fellow &#8220;Latins&#8221;.<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And I agree with M. Scott about the Vandals &amp; Visigoths. In fact, ther were entire Germanic tribes in northern Spain (e.g. around Zaragoza) who went over to Islam when it swept the peninsula. So it became racially blurry about who was what.  Also, the conquest WAS NOT from out of &#8220;black&#8221; Africa. Those early invaders were not black (much later, some were). The Arab leadership actually came from Syria, by way of Crete, and their foot-soldiers and horsemen were Berbers from North Africa. One of them married a Visigothic princess, thus gaining claim to the crown.  They took advantage of a dynastic squabble among the Visigoths who had ruled Spain for 400 years, and many Visigoths sided with them against their own.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unlikely there would have been any blacks among those early invaders. But they were followed by successive waves of invasion.  Centuries later, the Almoravids who conquered Ghana, and the fanatical Almohads out of Southern Morocco surely included some blacks. Those would be what we think of today as black Moors.  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/3xu87uk" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/3xu87uk</a></p>

<p>Another aspect of the tournament that the MSM censored was the poor attendance at many games. During several group stage games (including one with an African side   &mdash;   Cameroon, IIRC) and even a few round-of-16-games, I noted half-empty stadiums when the games started. Then 20-25 minutes later all the seats were full. No doubt the gates were thrown open to avoid an embarrassing spectacle. You can bet your last real that every game of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil will be a legitimate sellout.</p>

		<p>As a Spaniard (albeit born in the USA), I can&rsquo;t believe to describe the feelings of joy and pride and happiness I feel for the Spanish football team. These guys worked hard overcoming many critics who reveled in calling them &#8220;perennial underachievers&#8221; or &#8220;cursed&#8221;. They are now the World Champions of the most popular sport in the world, and they did it for themselves and for us.</p>
<p>To the individual who stated that the Beautiful Game was not popular amongst the Chinese and Indians, he  couldn&rsquo;t be more wrong. China has been in previous cups. Also, I took no offense at McGonagall&rsquo;s comment as it was not meant in an offensive manner since we are in fact the ONLY Hispanics, named as such by the Romans. What REALLY angers me is when I hear the average idiot on the street who refers to the Indians and Mestizos as &#8220;Spanish.&#8221; THEY ARE NOT SPANISH!!!!!</p>

		<p>I think people are misunderstanding why a lot of posters were jumping all over the poster that used the term &#8220;hispanic&#8221;.  It was in the context he used it in.  Go back and read the post again. It sounded as if he was the one making the first assumption on here that white Spanish people are the same as the &#8220;hispanics&#8221; that the people on here usually give a hard time.

		<p>  The controlled United States media, particularly NPR, did a poor job covering the World Cup. They didn&rsquo;t keep up with the winners in each category and they seemed to lose interest after the U.S. team was eliminated. While they rejoiced in the multi-racial character of the French and British teams, they remained relatively silent about the more homogenous Italian, Argentinean and Spanish teams. They were very disappointed at the loss of the &ldquo;Black Star&rdquo; African/Ghana team.  Some crazy media outlets appeared to blame that poor octopus, Paul, for the multicultural team losses, rather than the undisciplined players and poor coaching of the losing teams.  </p>

<p>Exactamente.  The word Hispania is the Latin root of  España/Espanya, which means Spanish. <br>
Thus, Hispanics are people from Hispania (i.e. Spaniards/Españoles).</p>

		<p>Re: Hispanic terminology</p>
<p>It is a fact that Mexico and surrounding areas had settlers not just from Spanish origin, but as has been mentioned, French as well.  Lesser known, are those who have some Italian blood as I do, or other European heritage such as Catalan, where for example my Father&rsquo;s ancestry comes from.  </p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, over the centuries, these people assimilated into a Spanish-oriented society, much like Argentina has quite a bit of Italian heritage, although it is a Spanish-speaking country today.</p>
<p><br>
I believe it has been our leader&rsquo;s intention to confuse the matter, forcing Whites as a whole to see statistics and reality through an Anglo-Saxon lens in some cases, and focusing us on trivial differences when in reality our real enemy to our way of life, is the third-world immigration agenda.  The usage of the word &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is one such case.  It has been polluted, used, and misused time and again to describe people who have been colonized by Spanish society.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What has not helped the matter I think, is the fact that the &#8220;Latin world&#8221;, have not traditionally kept as many dubious records on immigration as did the &#8220;Anglo world&#8221;.  Factoring into the equation was the tradition of Spanish last names: meaning, they were once VERY long, to indicate lineage, but somehow later became truncated.</p>
<p>Unless I have read wrong, it was Spanish-sponsored explorers (of various Latin backgrounds including Italian and Portuguese) who first arrived in Florida before the English did, although the Vikings are credited for first true &#8220;discovery&#8221; although quite a bit to the North I believe.</p>
<p>On the subject of the Spanish Football team: there are some who are Catalonian and not Castilian.  </p>

The fact is that the most successful soccer nation of all time (5 world cups) is Brazil which has has always had almost entirely black/mestizo players from poor backgrounds. Also, the African teams (Nigeria, Ghana) do very well at youth level, winning most of the youth tournaments in the past decade. Same with the largely black French and English. <br>
Besides, the all-white Scandinavian teams have had no international success whatsoever. <br>
So there is a lot in play here. <br>

<p>&#8220;Actually many Spanish have semitic or Arab blood in them. In the traditional white-racial homogenous sense, I don&rsquo;t know how far I could call them pure-white. Eg: Xavi, descended from Moors ( Jersey # 8 ): a star player who was vital to the team&rsquo;s success.<br>
Infact, Germany or Holland would be considered more white by comparison. Also, Spain did have a black player in their winning team - not pictured here.&#8221;</p>
<p>There always seems to be the one idiot who likes to state that Spaniards are not &#8220;pure&#8221; white. As an American born of Spanish parents, I find it highly insulting. It reminds me of when I was first engaged to my Scots-Irish wife, and her mother talked about us having an interracial marriage, though she never considered her brother marrying an Italian to be interracial. Of course our kids are not of a different race or &hellip; they simply look like Northern Spaniards, or swarthy Irishmen.</p>

<p>Soccerfan, the next time you make an assertion like that, you should quote some references, especially scientific ones. DNA studies conducted about the Spanish people this decade have concluded that the Spanish people are overwhelmingly of European origin with the Rb1 Haplotype. The Rb1 haplotype is the most common gene in Western Europe, for those of you who don&rsquo;t know. Though some amount of race mixing did occur during the Moorish occupation of the Iberian peninsula, such cases were rare due to taboos about that on both sides. Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492 by edict of Ferdinand and Isabella and Islamic Berber Moores were expelled 1609 by edict of King Phillip III. Since then, Spain has been one of the most homogeneous countries in Europe, up until the 1990s. </p>

<p>The next time your stupid in law talks about your &#8220;interracial marriage&#8221;, tell her to read Dr Brian Sykes&rsquo; book, Blood of the Isles (ISBN 0593056523). In that book, renowned geneticist Dr. Brian Sykes proves though the science of mitochondrial and autosomal DNA research that most of the people of the British Isles migrated to Ireland, Scotland, England, and Wales from the Iberian peninsula. The Anglo Saxon component of England is less than 20 percent.</p>
