			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FoxNews, July 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Faced with expensive legal challenges, officials in the eastern Nebraska town of Fremont are considering suspending a voter-approved ban on hiring or renting property to illegal immigrants until the lawsuits are resolved.</p>
<p>The City Council narrowly rejected the ban in 2008, prompting supporters to gather enough signatures for the ballot measure. The ordinance, which was approved by voters last month, has divided the community. Supporters say it was necessary to make up for what they see as lax federal law enforcement and opponents argue that it could fuel discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city faces lawsuits from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican American Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund. City officials have estimated that Fremont&rsquo;s costs of implementing the ordinance  &mdash;  including legal fees, employee overtime and improved computer software  &mdash;  would average $1 million a year.</p>
<p>Getzschman said it&rsquo;s not clear how much money the city would save by suspending enforcement of the ordinance. {snip}</p>
<p>Getzschman insisted the council is trying to act in the city&rsquo;s best interests and limit legal costs, even if the savings are small. In the meantime, the city has postponed informational meetings on the ban that were scheduled for this week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ordinance has put Fremont on the list with Arizona and other cities in the national debate over immigration regulations. Arizona&rsquo;s sweeping law also takes effect Thursday and requires police who stop people suspected of violating a law to check the immigration status of anyone they think is in the country illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It would require employers to use a federal online system that checks whether a person is permitted to work in the U.S.</p>
<p>It also would require people seeking to rent property to apply for a $5 permit at City Hall. Those who said they were citizens would receive a permit and would not have to provide documents proving their legal status. Those who said they weren&rsquo;t citizens would receive permits, but their legal status would be checked. If they&rsquo;re found to be in the country illegally and are unable to resolve their status, they would be forced to leave the property.</p>
<p>Landlords who knowingly rent to illegal immigrants could be subject to $100 fines.</p>

		<p>These towns, cities, and municipalities should do what whites do best:  organize.  They should join together and create a &#8220;flying circus&#8221; legal team to create a set pattern of pleadings and briefs, and an established panel of expert witnesses, who can travel from jurisdiction to jurisdiction litigating each case as merited.  That way, each town and city won&rsquo;t have to reinvent the wheel. This is exactly what states do with frequently litigated statewide issues.  For instance, Attorneys General in all 50 states have divisions dedicated to specific issues such as Sexually Violent Predator, elder abuse, and complex tort claims who travel around their respective state and have a set of canned briefs and &#8220;go to&#8221; experts on retainer that they use over and over.  The same strategy could be applied here, thus saving on attorneys fees by pooling resources.   </p>

		<p>No 2 &#8220;Anonymous&#8221; (lot of people in the USA seem to be named this as do many here in Britain, has an excellent idea. Also why cannot the States sue Washington for not carrying out a duty as per federal law?</p>
<p>The best form of defence is attack.</p>

<p>So, if you tell City Hall that you are a citizen, then you don&rsquo;t have to provide documents? These illegal hostile invaders steal American&rsquo;s Social Security numbers, what&rsquo;s to stop them from lying to City Hall about their status and saying they&rsquo;re a citizen?</p>
<p>Every time I see one of these so-calles laws or ordinances, I notice that they&rsquo;re not really saying anything at all. Just more smoke and mirrors these crooked politicians use to pull the wool over the eyes of real Americans to appease the masses. I saw one like this yesterday that I commented on. </p>
<p>Who else has noticed this? Of all the intelligent posters on this board, I certainly cannot be the only one.</p>

		<p>This should probably be done at the state level, just because of the expenses involved.  That said, vigorous enforcement of local &#8220;nuisance&#8221; ordnances, such as absurd numbers of unrelated people living in single-family homes offers a useful end-run.  The claim can always be made that this is intended to keep college students from ruining neighborhoods, even if the focus is on illegal aliens.</p>

		<p>Opinion from the US Supreme Court in De Canas v. Bica, 424 US 351 -1976:  <br>
The US Supreme Court upheld a California law barring the employment of illegal aliens against farm producers&rsquo; pre-emption argument: </p>
<p>California sought to strengthen its economy by adopting federal standards in imposing criminal sanctions against state employers who knowingly employ aliens who have no federal right to employment within the country; even if such local regulation has some purely speculative and indirect impact on immigration, it does not thereby become a constitutionally proscribed regulation of immigration;  absent congressional action, (the California law against hiring illegal immigrants) would not be an invalid state incursion on federal power.</p>
<p>Employment of illegal aliens in times of high unemployment deprives citizens and legally admitted aliens of jobs; acceptance 357*357  by illegal aliens of jobs on substandard terms as to wages and working conditions can seriously depress wage scales and working conditions of citizens and legally admitted aliens; and employment of illegal aliens under such conditions can diminish the effectiveness of labor unions. These local problems are particularly acute in California in light of the significant influx into that State of illegal aliens from neighboring Mexico</p>

		<p>We are supposed to be a nation of laws, but neither the illegal aliens nor the Federal Government respect our laws. How long will it be before fed up Americans follow them down a path to lawlessness?</p>
