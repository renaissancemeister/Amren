<h1>NAACP Blasts BP for Oil Spill Response</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Benjamin Todd Jealous, NAACP, July 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Friday, July 10 NAACP president and CEO sent a letter to British Petrolium CEO Tony Haward blasting the company for endangering communities of color in it&rsquo;s response to the oil spill disaster. Read the full letter below:</p>
<p>Mr. Tony Hayward<br>
CEO<br>
British Petroleum<br>
United Kingdom</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Hayward:</p>
<p>On behalf of the NAACP, our Nations&rsquo; oldest and largest grass roots based civil and human rights organization in the United States, with an active presence in over 1,200 membership units, in every state in the United States and a 101-year history of advancing rights. And specifically our units in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, representing thousands of persons who have been affected by this oil drilling disaster, I am writing to urgently request a meeting with you to ensure that all communities, including communities of color along the Gulf Coast are fully restored and receive needed support and assistance from BP.</p>
<p>For the past several weeks, NAACP national staff members have been on the ground in the affected states. Recently, I personally visited, and among other activities participated in a fly-over to view the oil spill disaster and the impact on the shorelines of Mississippi and Louisiana. Moreover, I met with members of the African-American, Vietnamese and Native American communities  &mdash;  including residents, business owners, elected officials, community based organizations, faith leaders, and others. I witnessed their anger, fear, hopelessness and frustration.</p>
<p>I emerged from that visit dismayed and outraged by what I heard and saw:</p>
<p>A gentleman named Darien gave testimony at a community meeting with tears in his eyes as he clutched the lease he signed in December for the shop he is on the verge of losing because he can&rsquo;t afford the tripled prices for crabs.</p>
<p>Chief Dardar of the Houma Nation spoke of the defilement of the land which defines the culture of the Houma nation.</p>
<p>Byron, an African American fisherman in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana showed one of my staff members his docked boats and described his loss of livelihood which supports his family.</p>
<p>Organizations representing Vietnamese fishermen who have been fishing the waters off the coast of Mississippi describe language access issues and how these barriers have made Vietnamese families vulnerable to predatory scams and also impeded their access to the claims process.</p>
<p>Throughout my visit, the following key issues emerged:</p>
<p>* Workers of color tend to be assigned the most physically difficult, lowest paying jobs, with the most significant exposure to toxins, while white workers tend to be in supervisory, less strenuous positions.</p>
<p>* Contractors of color are not receiving equal consideration for opportunities to participate in mitigation efforts.</p>
<p>* Local residents who have lost their livelihoods due to the oil spill are not being hired on to work crews. Instead, contractors engaged by BP to staff clean-up crews are busing in workers from out of state.</p>
<p>* Workers and residents who live on the coast have reported irritated eyes, nausea, problems breathing, and headaches.</p>
<p>* Cleanup workers are not being provided with protective clothing and masks, resulting in hospitalizations.</p>
<p>* People who are compelled to apply for cleanup work in order to feed their families  &mdash;  due to inadequacies of the claim process  &mdash;  are forced to sign documents that prohibit discussion of working conditions and forfeit legal redress for lost livelihoods.</p>
<p>* Community leaders are being denied access to information on the oil spill, particularly with respect to projections and plans are for mitigation.</p>
<p>* Community organizations offering a range of support services to families suffering from this disaster are financially strapped  &mdash;  impeding their ability fully to address the magnitude of the problem.</p>
<p>We understand and appreciate that BP has been engaged in numerous efforts to address the oil spill and its impact on communities  &mdash;  including the concerns that were shared with me. But we urge BP to take further steps, including the following actions:</p>
<p>1. Establish monitoring mechanisms and take remedial action to ensure that workers of color are not relegated to arduous tasks and low-paid positions.</p>
<p>2. Guarantee that communities of color are awarded their fair share of mitigation contracts.</p>
<p>3. Provide financial support to community based organizations that are assisting distressed families.</p>
<p>I trust that we will be able to meet in the very near future to discuss these and other recommendations, as well as to discuss how we can work together to make whole the families and communities that have been devastated by this tragedy.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to your reply.<br>

		<p>Because there are no white people being affected economically by the oil spill.  And obviously, BP&rsquo;s PR handlers have instructed the suits to clean things up as slowly as possible, because that&rsquo;s the way you earn brownie points with anti-oil fanatics on the left wing and in the Democrat Party.</p>

		<p> Yet another extortion demand from the NAACP. When is someone going to turn the tables on this trouble-making, race-baiting group? I would like to see all the individuals and organizations they have hassled over the years get together and file history&rsquo;s biggest class-action suit against them. Backrupt the group; put it completely out of business.</p>
<p> Think it couldn&rsquo;t be done? Then you don&rsquo;t know how lawyers operate   &mdash;   if you could find some that would take the case. Since lawyers tend to lean to the left, you might have to search a while. But it would definitely be worth it to see this group of race pimps finally get their comeuppance.</p>

<p>Well, that offers a form of insight, but were it leads is ridiculously estranged from its intent! Might not something like this also read, once a between the lines eye exercise is done, like this:</p>

You gets it right honky? We wants the oil money you deprived we&rsquo;uns of and that kind of stuff what relates to slavery&hellip;&rsquo; </p>

		<p>It sounds like it really doesn&rsquo;t matter how quickly or completely or inexpensively the mess gets cleaned up, so long as the &#8220;right&#8221; people are paid.  In short, more of the usual from the NAACP.</p>

		<p>The worst oil spill disaster in history, and all the NAACP is worried about is &#8220;getting theirs.&#8221; Does anyone really believe they&rsquo;re concerned about Native Americans, Vietnamese and hispanics? </p>
<p>And notice this line: </p>
<p><i>&#8220;People who are compelled to apply for cleanup work in order to feed their families &mdash; due to inadequacies of the claim process &mdash; are forced to sign documents that prohibit discussion of working conditions and forfeit legal redress for lost livelihoods.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>In other words, people who are given employment by BP are in fact being &#8220;victimized&#8221; by the company, which is mysteriously getting away with not following the law in telling job applicants of the dangers involved in the position they&rsquo;re being hired for.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make stuff like this up.</p>

		<p>Finally!</p>
<p><br>
Keith Olbermann was interviewing a black girl from Princeton just now about NAACP and their charges against BP&rsquo;s racism.</p>
<p>She was going on about how us Whites are unaware of the workings of White Privilege and how it affects institutional racism, or some such endless prattle that sound like that.</p>
<p>But finally, we have the topic of &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; entering the TV news.  We need more of it.  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve heard it spoke ever before tonight.  In these troubling and dangerous times, we need White America to see and hear blacks on TV complaining about White Privilege.  </p>
<p>Few things are as annoying and angering to White Humanity than being lectured by unjustly over privileged blacks about how Whites are privileged racist who need to overcome their outdated prejudices by feeling good about being made more and more miserable by the noble, equal, and entitled &#8220;people of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope that MSM and FoxNews pick up the White Privilege cue from MSNBC and run with it.  That one recurring phrase could drive thousands to us.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;We&rsquo;ve come far, but we still have more work to do. Our nation&rsquo;s business is unfinished.  Blacks are the moral story of this country and Whites still need to atone for the sins of segregation by holding themselves accountable to people of color for their unearned White Privileges.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
God, please let us hear that each and every day.   Worse is better, and that&rsquo;s about as good as it gets, other than FoxNews&rsquo; playing the &#8220;kill crackers and kill cracker babies&#8221; video over and over.</p>
<p>Can you feel it, sense it, taste it?  There is a change on the way.  We&rsquo;ll suffer, nonetheless, but more of those will suffer with us who actually deserve it: White Liberal Elites and their friends in racially segregated synagogues.<br>

		<p>It took all my strength just to get past the horrendous grammar in the first paragraph.  Now I&rsquo;m no grammatical heavyweight, but then again I don&rsquo;t claim to be a learned man, as I&rsquo;m sure the head of the NAACP surely does.</p>
<p>You tell me Mr. Benjamin Todd Jealous, when the head of the NAACP can&rsquo;t even use the language properly, why do you think &#8220;workers of color&#8221; aren&rsquo;t being given cleanup jobs with more responsiblity and higher pay?</p>
<p>This is just rich.  Never mind running an oil spill cleanup properly and as cost-effective as possible for the US taxpayers who are sure to end up on the hook, your first priority is making sure you&rsquo;re running an EEO oil spill, Mr. Hayward.</p>
<p>We at the NAACP, vying with the United Nations as the least-effective organization in history, are looking forward to your reply.  And now our guy is in the White House so you&rsquo;d better send it or you&rsquo;ll be out another $20 billion.</p>

		<p>Incredible.  Pathetic.  But standard.</p>
<p>This letter would be an embarassment for any CEO of a large nationwide organization to send out. It might be acceptable from Joe&rsquo;s Pizza Shack. </p>
<p>Not only is it poorly written, but some of it is incomprehensible. For instance:  &#8220;Community leaders are being denied access to information on the oil spill, particularly with respect to projections and plans are for mitigation.&#8221; &hellip; What does that mean???</p>
<p>I am not very sympathetic to BP in this matter, but I wish Mr. Hayward would send back a brusk reply&hellip;.</p>
<p>To: NAACP President &amp; CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous</p>
<p> &#8220;Dear Mr. Jealous:  Frankly, I fail to  see what this has to do with any &#8220;civil rights&#8221; or racial organization   &mdash;   specifically the NAACP.  Sorry.  Unlike you, we do not see this as a racial issue.  We are trying to deal with it on a non-racial basis as an ecological problem affecting all of the people, not just some.&#8221; </p>

		<p>This illustrates how these former Civil Rights organizations are now branching out into other fields and becoming empires. </p>
<p>Instead of withering up and going away, now that their goals have been achieved (and the White House has even become the Black House), they are looking for new resources to tap. </p>
<p>They have found a rich vein to mine, and they are not going to abandon it. Of course, this will necessitate endless cries of racism and discrimination, until the entire country is in their hands.</p>

The response should be to the affect that everyone and every community has been affected by oil spill and everyone with a legitimate claim will be handled on a case by case basis. It&rsquo;s not the practice of BP to discriminate in favor of one group, or individuals over others. To do so would be racist.</p>

BP should put out a release saying that for the health and safety of blacks and other people of color, they will immediately cease hiring black and other non-white workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has come to our attention that black workers are more susceptible to the affects of the oil spill. To safeguard the health of blacks, BP will no longer employ black workers in our clean up efforts&#8221;.</p>
<p>See how that plays. </p>

		<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t just me that had a hard time reading that letter.  Despite it being an comically absurd and arrogant appeal for payout it was just so poorly written it was beyond embarrassing.  Does anyone actually believe that cleanup workers aren&rsquo;t given protective clothing?   </p>

		<p>What is the NAACP&rsquo;s position on this&hellip; that the oil spill is just affecting &#8220;people of color&#8221;? That the oil is discriminating against blacks?</p>
<p>We all know how ridiculous the NAACP&rsquo;s behavior is. And how ridiculous it is to make this oil spill a racial issue. However, BP isn&rsquo;t very popular right now. And with a black man in the white house I suspect the Obama administration might coerce them into paying off his friends at the NAACP. After all, its a lot cheaper to pay off the NAACP and make campaign contributions to Obama&rsquo;s friends than it is to actually clean up the mess.</p>

Note to NAACP: before you send off letters to company CEOs, why not have a white proofreader vet them for spelling/grammar mistakes.  You&rsquo;d really increase your credibility.</p>

<p>The NAACP shares in the widespread concern re damage to the enviroment caused by this oil spill. </p>
<p>Many of our members have a long term attachment to this part of our nation, often going back several generations.As such, NAACP members would like to volunteer their services in whatever way possible to assist in the clean-up of Louisiana  wetlands,beaches, estauries and injured wildlife.</p>

		<p>The NAACP never misses a chance to shake down Whitey.  I always love it when they say this country has come so far in race relations, but still has so much farther to go.  We still need to atone for slavery.  I say we atoned enough with our blood on the fields of Gettysburg and all the other battlefields where Whites killed Whites to free Blacks.  Our country was nearly torn apart in their interests.  And when it was over, we took them in as citizens and gave them and their decendants a better future then they would have had in their homeland.  We&rsquo;ve already given too much.  It&rsquo;s time they started saying Thank You.</p>
