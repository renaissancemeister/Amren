			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Stein and Patrick Marley, Journal Sentinel (Milwaukee), July 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>State elections officials Wednesday narrowly rejected a Milwaukee Assembly candidate&rsquo;s attempt to run with the slogan &#8220;NOT the &#8216;whiteman&rsquo;s bitch&rsquo;&#8221; under her name on the ballot.</p>
<p>Ieshuh Griffin, an independent candidate with a history of feuds with local officials, said in response she would sue the state Government Accountability Board for infringing on her freedom of speech.</p>
<p>She is running to replace retiring Rep. Annette &#8220;Polly&#8221; Williams (D-Milwaukee).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unlike candidates from the established Democratic and Republican parties, independents are allowed a five-word statement of purpose on the ballot to explain to voters what their candidacy is about.</p>
<p>Shane Falk, a staff attorney for the Accountability Board, said that the board had the ability to restrict obscene or derogatory candidate statements from the ballot.</p>
<p>The board staff ruled that the statement was derogatory and should not be allowed. With one member absent, the board voted 3-2 in favor of reversing that ruling and allowing the wording. Under state law, however, four votes are needed for the board to act.</p>
<p>As a result, the staff decision stands, and Griffin will be on the ballot with &#8220;independent&#8221; by her name and nothing else. Falk noted that Griffin was still free to use the phrase in her campaign literature and any ads she might run.</p>
<p>The board, which administers state election laws, consists of six former judges. All of them are white.</p>

		<p>Actually someone should run a campaign with the slogan &#8220;Not the blackman&rsquo;s slave&#8221;. But it will come soon:<br>
More and more people who wanted Multi-Culturalism  are getting it and either they see the reality and flee to white areas or they don&rsquo;t see it and are lost.<br>
And the one who are conservative and race-realist? They stay. It is absolutely logical that the number of liberals will decline very fast. The only whites who can survive are those who don&rsquo;t mix. And when we look at the numbers of none-whites the only ones who will not mix are race-realists.<br>
It will not take until 2030 in my opinion until majority  whites will be race-realistic again. Maybe their number will be smaller but at least they will be more careful.</p>

		<p>Apparently she&rsquo;s not. Will she face constant questioning from minority reporters asking her if she&rsquo;s let her guard down, if she isn&rsquo;t now, doing &#8216;the white man&rsquo;s bidding&rsquo;? Holding her accountable, so to speak? Probably.</p>

		<p>And yet, she&rsquo;s not running as a Democrat?</p>
<p>The original article doesn&rsquo;t say whether she&rsquo;s married or not, but this self-proclaimed &#8220;not the white man&rsquo;s b&#8221; probably couldn&rsquo;t even get a black man.</p>

		<p>Obviously Ieshuh Griffin is running in a majority black district, where such a slogan will no doubt garner her many votes.  Nonetheless I support her right to use that slogan.  The faster whites wake up and realize what they&rsquo;re up against, the better.</p>
<p>Of course Ieshuh Griffin will never be called a &#8220;Nazi&#8221; by the Huffington Post or The New York Daily News, as the American Third Position has for being pro-white.</p>

		<p>You know, the &#8220;clear facility of language&#8221; exemplified by this candidate leads me to surmise that:  the simpler and more crude the language, the simpler and more crude are the people who use it.  F&rsquo;r instance, the Asian languages are generally agreed to be extremely difficult for non-native speakers to manage, as is the ancient language of Sanskrit.  German is also difficult, as are its derivitives Dutch and Yiddish.  German is also an extremely precise language, with the second half of the verbs almost always at the end of the sentence.  Educated English is also extremly complex and hard to learn.  However, uneducated English is simple and minimally difficult to learn, as evidenced by the barrio and ghetto folks who speak it.  Spanish is one of the easiest languages to learn - and remember that compulsory education in Mexico ends with Grade 6.  Note that the more complex languages are used to express not just instructions, but extremely profound philosophical ideas; all Asian languages have this, as do Sanskrit and Hindi.  German language speakers have among them many of the world&rsquo;s most profound thinkers.  Educated English also happily boasts profundities galore. However, you flat don&rsquo;t find this in uneducated English, rarely in Spanish, and almost never in the simple African tribal languages.  I once knew a tribal chief from Nigeria, whose main language was Ibo.  He taught several of us some of his language, and it was very simple, restraining itself to simple directions and descriptions.  It cannot be any accident that the literature and music of Asia, Europe, and even the U.S. are highly evolved and complex; the literature and certainly music of the Spanish and <br>
African countries are much simpler.  The music in particular relies on rhythm to keep it interesting; it has the simplest of melodic line and even more simple vertical (harmony) lines.  A lot of people would say this is racist, but for me it&rsquo;s just stating the facts.  It is definitely not PC, but I believe the quicker we lose that the better.  I believe that language and the degree of sophistication therein are clear clues to the level of class of the individuals who utilize them - it&rsquo;s not PC, but it IS true.</p>

<p>Ironically, the few African blacks that can excel in hard sciences and math, to an extent, are Ibo (which is of course an ethnicity and a language).  Every obviously Western African heritage teacher/professor of very high level math that I have ever known or known of has been Ibo Nigerian.  </p>

<p>So &#8220;NOT the whiteman&rsquo;s b**ch&#8221; fulfills the criteria. </p>
<p>I think she should be commended for following instructions and coming up with a creative vote-getting slogan.</p>
<p>But I would never for a woman who wouldn&rsquo;t be my b**ch, sorry!</p>

		<p>I find her campaign slogan catchy.</p>
<p>It is indeed a unique selling proposition for her target audience.</p>
<p>That said, I do not find it offensive.  I do not see the legal authority of the Wisconsin Governmental Accountability Board existing to deny her her request.</p>
<p>Maybe she speaks truth to power.  If they can deny her request, they can deny any request.  Say I wished to run, and under my name I wanted to use the slogan &#8220;Stop Corruption in the Wisconsin State House&#8221;.  It could be denied as the Board could assert that no corruption existed in the State House.  What then?</p>
<p>She can seek remedy in the Courthouse.  So would I.</p>
<p>And lets see if a white boyfriend pops out of the woodwork&hellip;  </p>

<p>You misread my post.  Both the Huffington Post and the New York Daily News call the American Third Position Nazi, complete with doctored up pictures of people with swastikas.  This is the way all the mainstream press reacts to any pro-white organization.</p>
<p>(As if Hitler even <i>was</i> pro-white, when all the countries he attacked were white.)<br>

		<p>I was confusing &#8216;the third position&rsquo; with &#8216;the third way&rsquo;. The &#8216;third way&rsquo; being a middle position similar to that held by Bill Clinton and often associated with him and other &#8216;new democrats&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>The members of the &#8220;Government Accountability Board&#8221; are clearly a bunch of &#8220;racists&#8221; (I would say &#8220;white racists&#8221;, but that is an obvious redundancy, since only whites can be racists).
