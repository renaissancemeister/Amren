			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sean Alfano, New York Daily News, June 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One Arizona politician has made a vow to make illegal immigrants powerless  &mdash;  literally.</p>
<p>Republican Barry Wong, a candidate for the Arizona Corporation Commission, an elected body that decides public utility issues, says he would require the utilities to check the immigration status of customers, he told the Arizona Republic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m sure there will be criticism about human-rights violations,&#8221; said Wong, who held a temporary spot on the five-person Commission in 2006. &#8220;Is power or natural gas or any type of utility we regulate, is that a right that people have? It is not a right. It is a service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cutting electricity, water, natural gas, even telephone lines at the homes of illegal immigrants, he said, would lower costs for the rest of the state&rsquo;s customers. He believes the population spike caused by illegal immigrants forces the state to build new power plants and then raise rates for customers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics, however, charge Wong with simply using a hot-button issue to gain notoriety and votes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone is seeing the polls that are so anti-immigrant, and everyone is jumping on the bandwagon to target immigrants,&#8221; said Julie Pace, a lawyer currently suing the state over a law punishing businesses that hire illegal immigrant help.</p>
<p>&#8220;They all are coming up with novel ideas how they can get elected. They say, &#8216;Target immigrants, and it helps me win an election.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Wong believes his idea deserves further study.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question is: Is it the right thing to do in terms of rates?&#8221; Wong, a former four-term member of the state&rsquo;s House of Representatives, told the paper.</p>

		<p>Good idea, Mr. Wong; I wish you luck.  At least you won&rsquo;t be subjected to the usual screams of &#8220;Racism&#8221; that would have been all over the media by now had your name been Smith.<br>

___________</p>
<p>Well, there is the problem right there in a nutshell. Businesses and their lawyers that think they should be able to hire low wage illegals so they can screw over American workers. You want to boycott, boycott these businesses and these lawyers. </p>

<p><i>&ldquo;They all are coming up with novel ideas how they can get elected. They say, &lsquo;Target [illegal] immigrants, and it helps me win an election.&rsquo;&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>It sure is consistent how advocates of illegal immigration always leave out the &#8220;illegal&#8221; part when they refer to the invaders.  And what is wrong with elected officials actually doing what their constituents want them to do (for a change)?</p>

		<p>The right thing to do is to deport them. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of any household legal or illegal receiving electric power without paying for it. I generally don&rsquo;t believe in taking away things people have paid for when there is no direct need to. So to me this would be a bad idea.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s no reason not to. They refuse to become legal. They won&rsquo;t contribute to our society. They won&rsquo;t get regular jobs that pay taxes so they can pay back some of the municipal resources they consume by being here illegally. Really the most logical thing to do would be to deny them any services and just kick them the hell out of the country. </p>

		<p>While most East Asians in the US seem quite liberal, the exceptions are real lu-lus.  This article had me chuckling for ten minutes.  Cut their water and power off?  Brilliant!</p>

		<p>Well the reason not to is because it sends a message that you want them to suffer. Such action would make us look vindictive not just. It makes our side look bad. Again to the best of my knowledge they did pay for their power. </p>
<p>If we know they are illegal we should deport them. I would support deporting at the state level before simply cutting their power after they&rsquo;ve paid the bill. </p>

		<p>I would modify this strategy by increasing taxes on all Arizona residents and then providing a larger tax credit to all residents who can produce proper documentation.</p>

		<p>I have to say, Mr. Wong does have the right idea: services are not rights. Now, this is not to say I support this somewhat vindictive line of action, but I believe in freedom of association.</p>
<p>On a side note, it may be different in Arizona, but if you qualify for welfare in Oregon, you can also qualify for assistance to pay for utilities. So, not everyone pays for their service. </p>
<p>Back to the big picture: If we do not reestablish the right of a association that was denied in the 1960s, we will never have a democratic nation again. Yes, we go to the polls to vote, but we make our presence most felt through business. If I do not like blacks, I should not have to serve or employ blacks. After all, a liberal restaurant in Portland just denied service to a police officer. Why can&rsquo;t I do the same to a black? The restaurant&rsquo;s owner claimed that one is born black, but chooses to become a police officer. Our parents don&rsquo;t only give us genes however, they bring us up to believe in certain principles. This young man was brought up to believe in law, however imperfect many of us know it to be. And what did this WHITE man do? He sucked it up. The business would NEVER have dared do that to a black man. </p>
<p>Racism: When a hard-working, self-making, honest American is rejected from society, while the entitled, loud-mouthed, lazy and dishonest non-American is praised.</p>
<p>My friends, American only refers to one nation.  </p>

<p>You should live in Philly. Here the natives get fried on a regular basis trying to steal electricity.</p>

		<p>Lela makes an important point. A good point. </p>
<p>State level deportations seems like the next logical step to me. State level deportations would send a message that Arizona doesn&rsquo;t have to associate itself with illegals</p>
