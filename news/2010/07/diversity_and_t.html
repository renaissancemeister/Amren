			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Webb, Wall Street Journal, July 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Forty years ago, as the United States experienced the civil rights movement, the supposed monolith of White Anglo-Saxon Protestant dominance served as the whipping post for almost every debate about power and status in America. After a full generation of such debate, WASP elites have fallen by the wayside and a plethora of government-enforced diversity policies have marginalized many white workers. The time has come to cease the false arguments and allow every American the benefit of a fair chance at the future.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an odd historical twist that all Americans see but few can understand, many programs allow recently arrived immigrants to move ahead of similarly situated whites whose families have been in the country for generations. These programs have damaged racial harmony. And the more they have grown, the less they have actually helped African-Americans, the intended beneficiaries of affirmative action as it was originally conceived.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} action was designed to recognize the uniquely difficult journey of African-Americans. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} But the extrapolation of this logic to all &#8220;people of color&#8221;  &mdash;  especially since 1965, when new immigration laws dramatically altered the demographic makeup of the U.S.  &mdash;  moved affirmative action away from remediation and toward discrimination, this time against whites. It has also lessened the focus on assisting African-Americans, who despite a veneer of successful people at the very top still experience high rates of poverty, drug abuse, incarceration and family breakup.</p>
<p>Those who came to this country in recent decades from Asia, Latin America and Africa did not suffer discrimination from our government, and in fact have frequently been the beneficiaries of special government programs. The same cannot be said of many hard-working white Americans, including those whose roots in America go back more than 200 years.</p>
<p>Contrary to assumptions in the law, white America is hardly a monolith. And the journey of white American cultures is so diverse (yes) that one strains to find the logic that could lump them together for the purpose of public policy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The old South was a three-tiered society, with blacks and hard-put whites both dominated by white elites who manipulated racial tensions in order to retain power. At the height of slavery, in 1860, less than 5% of whites in the South owned slaves. The eminent black historian John Hope Franklin wrote that &#8220;fully three-fourths of the white people in the South had neither slaves nor an immediate economic interest in the maintenance of slavery.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt created a national commission to study what he termed &#8220;the long and ironic history of the despoiling of this truly American section.&#8221; At that time, most industries in the South were owned by companies outside the region. Of the South&rsquo;s 1.8 million sharecroppers, 1.2 million were white (a mirror of the population, which was 71% white). The illiteracy rate was five times that of the North-Central states and more than twice that of New England and the Middle Atlantic (despite the waves of European immigrants then flowing to those regions). The total endowments of all the colleges and universities in the South were less than the endowments of Harvard and Yale alone. The average schoolchild in the South had $25 a year spent on his or her education, compared to $141 for children in New York.</p>
<p>Generations of such deficiencies do not disappear overnight, and they affect the momentum of a culture. In 1974, a National Opinion Research Center (NORC) study of white ethnic groups showed that white Baptists nationwide averaged only 10.7 years of education, a level almost identical to blacks&rsquo; average of 10.6 years, and well below that of most other white groups. A recent NORC Social Survey of white adults born after World War II showed that in the years 1980-2000, only 18.4% of white Baptists and 21.8% of Irish Protestants  &mdash;  the principal ethnic group that settled the South  &mdash;  had obtained college degrees, compared to a national average of 30.1%, a Jewish average of 73.3%, and an average among those of Chinese and Indian descent of 61.9%.</p>
<p>Policy makers ignored such disparities within America&rsquo;s white cultures when, in advancing minority diversity programs, they treated whites as a fungible monolith. Also lost on these policy makers were the differences in economic and educational attainment among nonwhite cultures. Thus nonwhite groups received special consideration in a wide variety of areas including business startups, academic admissions, job promotions and lucrative government contracts.</p>
<p>Where should we go from here? Beyond our continuing obligation to assist those African-Americans still in need, government-directed diversity programs should end.</p>
<p>Nondiscrimination laws should be applied equally among all citizens, including those who happen to be white. {snip}</p>

		<p>He didn&rsquo;t once mention the rising tide of non white Islamofacist power in Virginia and how it benefits from anti White policies.  He doesn&rsquo;t know about it? </p>
<p> Islam is a fascist political ideology that will kill our liberty by killing our foundation of Natural Law and the idea of legitimate government derived only from the consent of the governed.  </p>
<p><br>
Remember this, while you are still allowed to read it, Dec. of Independence-  </p>
<p>&#8220;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  &mdash;  That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Non white Islam is at war with us and our freedoms, and Virginia is being overtaken by them.</p>
<p><br>
Whites are so full of sweetness and light that they will just give away their own nation to the dusky Muslims  to prove we aren&rsquo;t racists.  Sort of like Whites&rsquo; worshipping Rosa Parks and Michael King Rev. as an atonement along the road to racial reconciliation and healing.  Whites believe that embracing and enforcing Diversity Race Privilege is more important to their salvation than the Blood of Jesus. </p>
<p>Through worrying about the Holocaust and &#8220;doing more&#8221; to atone for Jim Crow segregation, Whites give themselves a chance to become true Americans and therefore good citizens of the global community.</p>

<p>He really stepped in it this time.</p>
<p>Any White Man who dares challenge the left&rsquo;s White Privilege weapon will be smeared as &#8220;the rising mainstream face of the Neo-Nazi Klu Klux&#8221;.</p>
<p>When you hear &#8220;White Privilege,&#8221; you are suppose to fall to your knees, bow your head, and declare, &#8220;Yes, I am a Racist, and I acknowledge my unearned White Privilege,  and I will atone for the sins of segregation by holding myself accountable to people of color, which means I will never apply for a job that a more deserving minority wants. I will dedicate my life to fostering Diversity and helping minorities. I will teach my White Daughters that they can break down barriers, promote change, and uplift human dignity by dating blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>White Humanity&rsquo;s push back against the mandated response to the accusations of &#8220;unearned White Privilege&#8221; simply will not be tolerated by the left.  They can&rsquo;t afford to lose another weapon from their arsenal.</p>
<p>Our continued surrender and concessions and submission to Affirmative Diversity Race Action Privilege depends upon our feeling guilty for our White Privilege.  They can&rsquo;t afford the push back on this one, especially when the economic malaise has hurt so many Whites.   We just aren&rsquo;t in a mood to &#8220;do more&#8221; for the ignorant, incompetent, sullen, dangerous blacks and the criminal illegal aliens.<br>

		<p>Utter rubbish.</p>
<p>James Webb is a southern democratic Senator trying to appease a Southern Democratic Vote while pretending to jump on the race-realism bandwagon.  Which is to say continuing the Black Dole while offering &#8216;true equality&rsquo; to the rest of us.</p>
<p>1.  If there is no guilt (can be no guilt, for those of who were never Southern Slave owners) because _these are no longer slaves_ and are owed NOTHING for their &#8216;history&rsquo;.</p>
<p>2.  If 3rd world emigres&rsquo; start out at a far greater deficit in terms of nutrition, language, useful skills.</p>
<p>How can it be &#8216;right&rsquo; to continue to support the &#8216;long suffering blacks&rsquo; and not the the foreign invaders?</p>
<p>Indeed if these people are in such dire straights then WHY for pities sake are we importing them to a country which should be dependent on high technology, leveraged manufacturing and an increasing technology base in both computing and bio engineering?</p>
<p>Costs.  That&rsquo;s what.  It costs more to pay an educated white what they are worth than it does to support an LMI population of junk consumerists -just- above the poverty level with cheap handout social welfare programs.</p>
<p>THAT folks is what has got to change.</p>
<p>For most people below a mean 90-95 IQ, this life is never going to offer them much.  We (upper middle class whites) would be better off devising a cheap system of &#8216;managed offsets&rsquo; (free) to keep these people fed and housed and &#8216;entertained&rsquo; at minimum intrusion into the economy _in trade for_ sterilization after their first kid.</p>
<p>Once you start treating populatoins the way a naturalist treats an environmental carrying capacity, you can truly start to see the reality of what populations are useful to society and which ones are not.  Short of a huge effort through gene therapy to engender a massive, cross-racial, rise in intellect, we are all screwed pretending that-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Our government should be in the business of enabling opportunity for all, not in picking winners. It can do so by ensuring that artificial distinctions such as race do not determine outcomes. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Is a great idea.</p>
<p>While this-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Memo to my fellow politicians: Drop the Procrustean policies and allow harmony to invade the public mindset. Fairness will happen, and bitterness will fade away.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Is ever going to happen to or for blacks (or any other ethny that has a trash element) that simply don&rsquo;t want to move up in life so much as live it as an entitlement.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t EVER contribute enough to be happy with what they can earn.  And so they won&rsquo;t contribute.  Except by birthrate.  And that is nothing but an attempt to create demographic dominance which amounts to a dumb-down of our nation.</p>

<p>Diversity is enforced by torturing Whites into agreeing that they benefit from &#8220;systemic and institutional racism,&#8221; i.e., they unjustly benefit from &#8220;White Privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>When White Humanity calls &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; a myth, the race hustlers hear us say, &#8220;We refuse to acknowledge and dismantle systemic and institutional racism, which means you will need to actually earn you way to a paid job instead of having it just given to you by White Liberal Elites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks will not tolerate our obstinacy.  </p>
<p> We are headed toward a calamitous Day of Racial Reckoning, and you have better be on good terms with your  White Kinsmen Neighbors when it happens. If you have carpetbaggers and scalawags in your neighborhood, find out who else is annoyed by their presences, and build unity around that common frustration. </p>
<p><br>
Who can&rsquo;t accept change, according to the $PLC? People like us can&rsquo;t, obviously, because we enjoy White Privilege so much that we can get away with posting our Race Realism on the Internet. </p>
<p>Look for the framing &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; as a myth to result in more hysterical calls to control the Internet.   Look for no TV shows to interview Jim Webb, and thus not put the &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; reactionary anger into the common conversation about race. </p>
<p><br>
From the $PLC, and we know how to read it as a warning-</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re happy Ms. Sherrod has been utterly vindicated. But the truth is that Fox News and other media outlets are doing real damage to our country. By spreading falsehoods and bogus conspiracy theories, the Glenn Becks of the world are fomenting rage among those who can&rsquo;t accept the demographic and political changes taking place in our country and the progress we&rsquo;re making toward justice and tolerance.</p>
<p>end snip</p>
<p>Sherrod was fired before FoxNews ever broadcast the tapes. Now she calls them racist. That&rsquo;s &#8220;vindication&#8221; in the shakedown business.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Doing] real damage to our country.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s us, too.  Who does real damage to their county? Traitors, that&rsquo;s who.  What better reason to call for an urgent formation of the Obama Civilian Defense Corps?  The OCDC can help police the media, the Internet, and be given enforcement and arrest powers under a new version of the Hate Crimes Laws.   </p>
<p>We are part of the &#8220;fomenters of rage,&#8221; which means we are encouraging another Holocaust and want to revive lynching.  We are potentially violent and must be fought will all the power of the OCDC.</p>
<p><br>
The progress we, White Humanity, is making toward justice and tolerance is the rising surge of Race Realism.  </p>
<p>Race Realism strides forward toward justice for Whites.</p>
<p>Race Realism surges forward toward tolerance for White Privilege, i.e. recovery of the God given pursuit of White Life, White Liberty, White Property, and White Happiness.<br>

Kagen supporters presented her (as if this was her most important qualification) as a public official who had spent her career ensuring equal opportunity and fighting discrimination.

<p>We Amreners like nothing better than a wide open awareness of the Race Debate.  Whites have been suffering since 1954, and our misery keeps getting worse.  All race conversations tend toward exposing the truth and then moves Whites forward toward the accepted revelations of Race Realism, which empower us to make rational defenses of our God Given White Privilege.   </p>
<p>Please dear media gods, give us more race stories. We beggeth of thee, &#8216;O MSNBC!  Help  &#8220;do the right thing&#8221; by &#8220;blowing it wide open&#8221;. Sweet Jesus, Amen.</p>

		<p>Next time you hear a black talk about our unearned white privilege, just say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, tell me about what you saw in Africa last time you went home, and don&rsquo;t use White English to do it.  I want to hear it  in your authentic and vibrant native African dialect.&#8221;</p>
<p>How many blacks do you know who have actually been back to Africa?  If they haven&rsquo;t been there, they have no right to talk to us about anything that is rightfully ours.</p>
<p>Everything they have, we gave them:</p>
<p>  Emancipation from the horrors of savage African tribal violence, liberation from having to work for a living, free citizenship in the most generous and powerful nation(approaching expiration date)  in the history of mankind, free votes to cancel out the White man&rsquo;s vote, cash payments for breeding, the English language (without a usage fee), the offices of government, the multimillion dollar financial endowments at Formerly White Colleges and Universities, etc, etc, etc, until they have it all, and we are left with nothing but memories of our loss and enduring shame at what fools we&rsquo;ve been. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing we need to atone for: OUR RACIAL SHAME.</p>
<p>Our posterity, the few White ones that will get born and survive, will hate us with an enduring hate that will never pass.</p>
<p>We are the last generation who believes in ancestor worship.  Those who come after us will know nothing but ancestor contempt.</p>
<p>What a horrid, miserable nation we are leaving for them. We better hope then never study history and learn how things were supposed to be and how good it once was.</p>
<p>Or, if they still have pure blood, when they learn about Jim Crow, they will build altars to him and pray for his resurrection and return.<br>

		<p>Even though it goes against what many of us believe, I think that for STRATEGIC reasons alone, we should endorse the idea that Affirmative Action (for opportunity, not results) should be reserved for blacks.  The political viability of Diversity is maintained by the fact that blacks, Hispanics and women (except those married to a white man), who otherwise have nothing in common, are united in discriminating against white men.   </p>
<p>Recent immigrants do not deserve affirmative action, because they have no historical claim to oppression.  Women do not deserve it, because they are born into the same circumstances males are, with one mother and one father (at least biologically).  They don&rsquo;t inherit historical legacies like blacks do, and young ones are currently doing BETTER than men in education and employment.</p>
<p>I therefore suggest that we hold our noses, and stick up for affirmative action for blacks only.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not for me to judge the sincerity of senator Webb, he has always seemed to me to be a pragmatic patriot, I must note however, that it was a restrained sort of political essay. There was no criticism of the President&rsquo;s policies, and this southern senator reserved his pity for southern whites, nor did he address the diversity of results that we have seen among our post-1965 immigrants.  But I am at least encouraged that he, or his political side as it were, felt the need to write it. </p>

		<p>Why is that it is always the two racial groups blacks and hispanics that need endless &#8220;help&#8221;?  Perhaps, those two groups should be encouraged to help themselves and others including disadvantaged whites instead of expecting entilements.  White privileged is a myth.  Not all whites have the same equal economic standing such as Rockefellars, Mellons, etc.  The average whites are the ones forced to massively fund for this nonsense of affirmative action, etc., etc.  These whites writing for the disadvantaged minorities does so to make themselves look and feel good.  </p>

		<p>Do you remember the White huckster who made millions with MegaTrends in 1982?   Not a single one of his ten megatrends dealt with race.

<p>The Race Problem has been the undoing of our White Republic, and the &#8220;corporate consultants&#8221; never told us about it? How could the smartest with the greatest data access not see it coming? </p>
<p>The answer is easy, they were either 1) genuinely blinded by the Equality Lie, or 2) they knew the truth but also knew they&rsquo;d miss out on millions of dollars if they spoke it.</p>
<p>My guest is that since they were smart and White, they knew the truth and just made as much money as possible as soon as possible before Nature made fools of them through the agency of the race problem.  It&rsquo;s much easier to endure being  thought a fool when you are rich than it is never getting rich because you spoke Race Reality.</p>
<p>Glenn Beck, the neocon shill that he is, at least stokes race suspicion, which makes him at least partially on our side.</p>
<p>He  pointed out today that our Republic is gone: Obamacare takes away your pursuit of Life, and the new financial regulations bill takes away your pursuit of Happiness.  </p>
<p>All that&rsquo;s left to lose is your Liberty, which is 1/3 of your White Privilege.</p>
<p>You have lost 2/3 of our White Privilege since Obama started transforming America.  He stole it from you in 18 months. He was elected by a minority of Whites who ganged up with the blacks and Hispanics to out vote the majority of Whites.</p>
<p>  Do you think your Liberty will survive till March 2013?   It won&rsquo;t, and the way it won&rsquo;t is when your White Vote is completely canceled out in 2012 by the new Amnesty Diversity.</p>
<p>More Whites will come back to us, but Obama will have enfranchised so many illegals and felons by then that we will be completely submerged.</p>
<p>The good news is that when the complete chaos breaks out in 2014-2015, there will be enough fondness among our people for regaining our White Privilege that maybe then we will finally come together and reclaim what is ours.</p>
<p>The MegaDoom is the loss; MegaBoom will be the recovery.  As Nick Griffin has said, if you have a habit that holds you back or hurts your health, you better kick it now, because you will need every bit of your vigor and strength in the days to come.  </p>
<p>Do your push ups- eat your vegetables- hone your skills- love your family.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s coming. Prepare. Read Demothsenes. Feel the urgency.</p>

		<p>The Internet in America is used my mostly Whites (never mind that most American are White), therefore, the Internet is an outdated bastion of White Privilege.  We must control and direct the Internet so as to create a more equitable, fair, and just flow of news and opinion.</p>
<p>White Privilege is an obstacle to Diversity Justice, especially when a Race Story explodes like Sherrod did.</p>
<p>Be on the lookout for pundits who say &#8220;we just can&rsquo;t afford&#8221; to let the Internet say this or say that or say anything that we wouldn&rsquo;t have approved.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just can&rsquo;t afford&#8221; is a progressive code phrase used as a talking point directive for politicians to justify what should come next: White Liberal Elites and their token blacks coming together to steal the Internet so as to lessen the harmful effect of White Privilege running rampant and damaging our democracy through unwarranted and unjustified abuses of the First Amendment.</p>
<p><br>
Here&rsquo;s the messy transcript from Today Show. Look at her &#8220;fabricated story and this country cannot a afford this kind of&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s what you will be seeing much more of in the liberal responses to the RACE NEWS to come.   </p>

<p>but i think you&rsquo;re doing too much moral equivalent, matt. i really think you&rsquo;re seeing people in the media system in this country who are doing good work. in this case &#8220;the atlantic journal constitution&#8221; and cnn stood back, took the time and vetted due diligence which is what the white house may have done. fox news hasn&rsquo;t retracted the story. shepherd smith has sued a few words. this was a ginned up, fabricated story and this country cannot a afford this kind of [fake journalism (you can hear it on the video)]</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; bill o &#8216;reilly also apologized. they didn&rsquo;t run the tape until after the resignation. so it&rsquo;s not as if they forced the resignation. </p>

		<p>I agree with anonymous also. Here is my free political analysis, for what its worth. </p>
<p>Webb wrote this with the blessings of the democratic leadership. Perhaps he was even told to write it.</p>
<p>The purpose is to confuse the white middle-center voters (also known as independents) into thinking that the Dems share their concerns about out of control entitlement and affirmative action programs. The Dems hope by doing this to win back some of the votes that they have lost since the election. Not a bad strategy and they truly have nothing to lose. Of course they don&rsquo;t mean what they write. Anyone with half a brain could see that.</p>
<p>Of course the best strategy, in my opinion, is to govern honestly and realistically, but of course this was rejected at all levels by &#8220;our&#8221; politicians.</p>

<p>Senator Webb&rsquo;s seeming concern for the gross unfairness of federal and state diversity/affirmative action initiatives toward lower-income whites   &mdash;  - eloquently expressed in &#8220;Diversity and the Myth of White Privilege&#8221; in the Wall Street Journal   &mdash;  - is, unless a sudden revelation, hypocrisy because of his votes for cloture on the Democrats&rsquo; healthcare and financial reform measures.</p>

Any White Man who dares challenge the left&rsquo;s White Privilege weapon will be smeared as &ldquo;the rising mainstream face of the Neo-Nazi Klu Klux&rdquo;.</p>
<p>First off he is a Democrat.  Democrats can say whatever they want and get away with it. </p>
<p>Second, the ruling class may be grooming him as a running mate for Obama in 2012. What he wrote, telling whites that they are the new victim class, would have a lot of appeal to many whites.  How many people voted for McCain because of Palin? It would make a good balanced ticket, since Webb is a Southern moderate. <br>

<p>What isn&rsquo;t a &#8220;cheap ploy&#8221; in modern day politics? I&rsquo;m really not concerned about the motivations that led Webb to bring up this issue, but in the fact that it was at least brought up by a Democrat who has broken ranks from the usual anti-white rhetoric of his party, and thus it is not as easy to hit back against what he said as would be the case if a Beck or O&rsquo;Reilly tried to make the case for getting rid of diversity entitlements.</p>
<p>One other point: Is it my imagination or are some of these posts a little bizarre and off point? Normally I read postings on this web site for an air of racial and political sanity but at least from a political realist, as opposed to race realist point of view, I find little worthwhile in what I&rsquo;ve read so far.</p>

		<p>Blacks have been receiving Affirmative Action perks for half a century now.  Whatever leg up they needed to emerge from the Jim Crow era is no longer needed.  They now have equal opportunity, and that&rsquo;s all they need.  No young black person today is tainted by slavery or de jure segregation.  </p>
<p>Affirmative Action and its ilk have become money-making operations and campaign slogans.  As others have stated, the one good thing about them is that white people are becoming increasingly incensed and may vote accordingly.</p>

		<p> Excellent article by Sen. Webb! He makes some very pertinent points about the spread of &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; to non-Whites whose ancestors were never slaves in this country and who have not been the victims of government-sanctioned discrimination themselves. The poor Whites in this country have been truly the &#8220;forgotten people&#8221;   &mdash;   forgotten or, more accurately, deliberately ignored by the black civil rights agitators and their White-guilt allies in an attempt to focus all sympathy on blacks as if no one else ever had a hard time in the U.S.</p>
<p> However, I think his closing statement, that if we would just make assistance needs-based, instead of race-based, everything will be hunky-dorey, is sadly mistaken. Does he think for one minute that blacks will voluntarily give up the whip hand that yelling &#8220;Racism!&#8221; and alleging &#8220;White guilt&#8221; have given them over huge amounts of government spoils in this country? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p> Resentment over old grievances, real or imagined, and a notion of entitlement have been handed down by blacks like a treasured family heirloom, from father to son and mother to daughter, for so long that eradicating that mindset may well take many years   &mdash;   if it ever can be. </p>

<p>But folks should understand that this is just a case of a cursed, anti White media trying to gain some false support. All should understand that Wall Street Journal has consistently pushed for open borders immigration, of unlimited numbers 100 of millions of non White Third World people. The WSJ used to do July 4th editorials:</p>
<p>There should be Open Borders.</p>
<p>Now the WSJ is playing some game, trying to promote this Web, who&rsquo;s a race mixer married to some Asian I hear as a new Lou Dobbs - somebody on the side of regular Americans. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled.</p>
<p>Webb and the WSJ will do some spin where we get increased LEGAL immigration with some supposedly big concession that immigrants will not get preferential treatment and their will be less welfare, free markets will solve everything.</p>
<p>The WSJ is only good for having your dog waste on it.</p>

		<p>There is very little of these problems that could not instantly be solved by defunding (and ultimately dissolving) the federal government.</p>
<p>Enough whites are racially awake now that, if forced to convince local voters to pay for it, almost no tax payers would agree to pay taxes to be redistributed to non-whites.</p>
<p>It is ONLY our (noticeably weak, corrupt and nearly powerless) federal government that provides the money for these things via taxing the lions share of wealth away from those who earned it. Taxation is almost completely a voluntary act.  Individuals who refuse can suffer consequences (although almost nobody who dodges taxes actually does) but groups&hellip;..states&hellip;there is no mechanism in place to force compliance.</p>
<p>The first state that decides tax money is better kept locally, will END the federal government.  This will probably happen soon.  First a state (MANY states are in the process of doing this) will pass laws that nullify most if not all federal laws.  Then they will make it illegal to pay federal taxes and demand that tax money be sent to the state.  State and local authorities will threaten the IRS with imprisonment (much like is being done right now to the BATFE) if they try to enforce federal tax regulations in that state.</p>
<p>The first state that does this will cause a domino effect.  This is probably the dominant issue being discussed behind closed doors in the majority of the states.  A soft seccession.<br>

Then,  I couldn&rsquo;t understand why an article such as this would appear in the WSJ, why the editors would give it a green light  &mdash;  - until I read Lonely Jew&rsquo;s post.</p>
<p>Lonely Jew:  I want to thank you for your concise, succinct, dead-on post.  Your explanation is the only one that makes sense.  Everyone would do well to re-read this post and take heed as to the kind of things the dems are up to.</p>
<p>No way Webb wrote this deception (or lent his name to it) without the blessing of the democratic party leadership.</p>
<p>This is a perfect ploy to placate nervous Kulaks into believing that Democrats represent them and their interests, to &#8216;bring them back into the fold&rsquo; before the next election, before they are lost to the GOP, or worse, the &#8216;racist&rsquo; Tea Party.  </p>
<p>Tea Partiers have already been effectively neutered by throwing the r-bomb at them:  &#8220;Tea Partiers are Racist!&#8221; Forcing them to spend excruciating amounts of time, resources and energy defending themselves against accusations of racism.</p>
<p>It reminds me of that old Star Trek episode where Spock neutered a computer by asking it to &#8220;compute to the last digit the exact value of Pi.&#8221; </p>
<p>Democrats operatives are even crafty and one must never let his guard down around them.</p>
<p>Their ulterior motive, of course, is to hold onto power  &mdash;  government power  &mdash;   by Any Means Necessary.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s Lee Atwater when you need him?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The 1988 Bush campaign overcame a 17-point deficit in midsummer polls to win 40 states. Atwater&rsquo;s skills in the 1988 election led one biographer to term him &#8216;the best campaign manager who ever lived.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ed Rollins claimed  that Atwater was telling this story about how a Living Bible was what was giving him faith and I said to Mary, &lsquo;I really, sincerely hope that he found peace.&rsquo; She said, &lsquo;Ed, when we were cleaning up his things afterwards, the Bible was still wrapped in the cellophane and had never been taken out of the package,&rsquo; which just told you everything there was. He was spinning right to the end&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Politics is a dirty business, I expect the upcoming elections to be the dirtiest ever.  The only way to counter the saul alinsky communists currently in power is to fight fire with fire, ruthlessly, relentlessly and without mercy&hellip;.just like Atwater did.</p>

You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there, you always got more than enough rope.&#8221;  And the third I will mention is &#8220;Not Dark Yet.&#8221;&hellip; .. &#8220;but it&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dylan actually turned his back on the radical left way back in the mid 1960s and got booed and even threatened with murder for departing and changing his style.  But I think he still has a certain way of saying what many are thinking, and it&rsquo;s not necessarily politically correct at all.</p>

Just because he calls it a myth, doesn&rsquo;t mean it won&rsquo;t continue being used as a lever to pry away Life, Liberty, Property, and Happiness from White Humanity.  If anything, now that he has tried to put it in doubt, the efforts against us will redouble.</p>
<p>On today&rsquo;s Georgia Gang political show, the plump, balding, mustachioed AJC political reporter was lamenting how poorly a black did in a GOP primary.  He said, &#8220;It&rsquo;s more proof of the GOP&rsquo;s Diversity Problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whites are now supposed to hate themselves when a majority White political party doesn&rsquo;t atone for the sins of segregation by electing the black.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t he mention the black Ga. congressmen who are members of the all black Congressional Black Caucus as maintaining a racist Diversity Problem? </p>
<p>Atlanta&rsquo;s Diversity Problem is the majority black population that never misses and opportunity to make life miserable for White Humanity.</p>
<p>The White reporter who is worried about the lack of Diversity should give up his White Job to a more deserving minority.</p>
<p>Ross Stores ran an ad during the show in which was depicted a White girl and a black on a date together playing games at the county fair.  We now boycott Ross Stores and say a prayer for that poor girls White Parents who failed miserably at protecting her from the Diversity Curse.  If she were raised properly, she would have boycotted the integrated production set.<br>

<p>While I share your awe of Lee Atwater&rsquo;s political skills, he used them to elect essentially a ruling class blue blood (Bush 41), and the election of Clinton, Bush 43 and Obama were nothing more than chain reactions to Bush 41 winning.  I only wish he could have used his great skill set to pick some diamond in the rough out of obscurity to make him or her President.  </p>
<p>I remember after Bush 41 won, someone asked Atwater if he thought he could make a ham sandwich President.  His answer?  &#8220;No, because it wouldn&rsquo;t any of the Jewish vote.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I have read Webb`s stuff for years. The female dog brigade in congress tried to crucify him over Tail Hook. His kid did two tours in Iraq and maybe one in Afghanistan. He detests liberals, rich Yankees from the North east and poverty pimps.His condemnation of Bush`s imperialistic wars was Lincolnesque. He is sick of our Scots-Irish seed corn being ground down in stupid wars that make rich Yankees richer and poor southerners dead. With any luck Morris Dees and the Southern Poverty Law center will get on his case. I`d pay 1000 to be there when he cold cocks Dees on national tv.<br>

<p>&#8220;Tea Partiers have already been effectively neutered by throwing the r-bomb at them: &ldquo;Tea Partiers are Racist!&rdquo; Forcing them to spend excruciating amounts of time, resources and energy defending themselves against accusations of racism.</p>
<p>It reminds me of that old Star Trek episode where Spock neutered a computer by asking it to &ldquo;compute to the last digit the exact value of Pi.&rdquo; </p>
<p>What an apt illustration!  Of course, a computer cannot (HAL excepted) be paranoid, so a simple request with obvious results stymied the naive computer.  This is why with the advent of official &#8220;banned&#8221; words and French Revolutionary style denouncements, all a Madame DeFarge need do is shout &#8220;Racist!  Enemy of the people!,&#8221; and your place in line for the guillotine is assured.</p>
<p>Yet I still hope for that backlash of reason and truth that will end the Reign of Terror and the Robespierre&rsquo;s of the present will be deposed.  But it is all a dangerous business.</p>
<p>I read with interest some of the comments on a CNN post-blog regarding a suggestion for secession of the State of Tennesee by Zach Wamp last week.  The posting had been quickly closed, and no wonder.  Every post I read was virulent with death threats via lynch mob, calls for everyone who suggests it to be put to death by hanging, etc.  There wasn&rsquo;t one post that stood back and analyzed what the issue might be, or a larger threat.  Neither was there a recollection of Hawaii&rsquo;s repeated calls for secession by the native population, or any of the other relavant issues, such as last weeks approval of Kosovo&rsquo;s declaration of independence from Serbia, something NATO and the UN had guaranteed Serbia would not occur back in 1999 when they were bargaining for Serbia&rsquo;s (Yugoslavia) to cease its actions against Albanian seperatists.   (Nearly everyone seems to be failing to see the similarity in our Southwest situation with Mexico and the political changes there).  The blog read just like a commentary on a medeival inquisition against a heretical thought.  Not only did many commentors call for Wamp&rsquo;s hanging, but also a search for any of similar thoughts.  I finished that peruse coming away with a definate feeling that we are much further along toward the collapse than I thought.  The language was every bit as hateful and potent as John Brown&rsquo;s or self righteous Yankees (my own ancestors.  I would love to know how they felt about it by 1875).</p>
<p>Back in the 1970s, I made a personal prediction that as time went on, U.S. politics and society would begin to appear and function more like Mexican and South American regimes.  Today, we have the same tendancy, on both political sides, for an elitist political class, that feeds on the majority of the people, &#8220;making the rich, richer and the poor, poorer.&#8221;  What they are creating is a mass of people who are educated, skilled, and increasingly white.  Their gamble, I am guessing, is that these people will pass away quiety and the future will see a two-tiered society.  Of course, religion, namely Christianity is being used to deceive, and manipulate where it may.  The individual doesn&rsquo;t stand much of a chance against so many pressures.  So the question remains whether whites can organize themselves and have an equivalent to an NAACP?  Likely, white opposition groups, even non-violent ones, would quickly produce a violent reaction, because they will be seen as a huge threat to the established priviliges of the NAACP.  They already have their paramilitary arm in The New Black Panthers.  Our one ace is that whites self arm overwhelmingly in comparison to other groups, even if we are quietly doing it.  The other possible ace is that our military, especially our combat troops still tend to be made up of whites from rural, traditionally conservative regions.  If a breakdown occurs as Civil War ll illustrates, the early part of the epic will be military fallout, as the power is settled there.</p>
<p>Emotions are high and people perhaps too easily say irresponsible things, but the wise will not pretend that these are merely words.  Words always have preceeded revolution and some words, once pronounced provide little room for retreat.</p>
<p>I want to see all our current issues solved as peacefully as possible because I know about human suffering.  A change in the Union will definately cause a world wide depression.  War would break out everywhere.  Perhaps for those will literally nothing to loose, this may seem liberating to them.  But my guess is that they are mostly engaging in the same sort of macho bravado that accompanied soldiers to the fields in our Civil War, and so many other wars, including WW1.  If we have truly learned anything, it ought to be how to make changes dictated by necessity, even if it might be to allow states more autonomy, and face reality in areas like race and simply admit that the existence of racial and ethnically seperate states is natural.  After we cease to insist on forcing round pegs into square holes, destroying one or the other, we might be able to have some peace in the world.  Everyone simply needs to learn the limits and responsibilities that come with freedom.  And yes, those who want to live in theocratic states should be able to, as long as they stay in them and the state remains with them.</p>

<p>I wish this were the case as well.  I am no fan of Clinton, Bushes 41 &amp; 43 but I do not believe the alternatives would have been any better (Dole?  Dukakis?  Algore?).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m of the school that 99% of politicians are wh****  &mdash;   power-seeking megalomaniacs who will do anything (legal or illegal) to obtain and hold on to it.  After all, the ultimate aphrodisiac is POWER   &mdash;  the ability to force others to bend to your will.  </p>
<p>And government, of course, is force, in fact, the Ultimate Force  &mdash;  the ability to command the armed forces!  The ability to punish those with whom you disagree or have wronged you.  The power to seek justice or withhold it from those you despise.  The power of having your enemies grovel at your feet lest you sic the IRS or Justice on them.  </p>
<p>Atwater was an attention- and power-seeking mercenary.  I don&rsquo;t think he cared who he elected as long as he was out in front, prominent in the halls of power, had powerful politicians seeking his advice and was able to put the Fear of God in his enemies.<br>
 <br>
On Dukakis:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Atwater declared that he would &#8216;strip the bark off the little bastard&rsquo; and &#8216;make Willie Horton his running mate.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Which is exactly what he did.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve seen the new, HBO documentary, there is an amazing scene featuring one of his more notorious &#8216;dirty tricks.&rsquo;  Atwater accused Kitty Dukakis of burning American Flags in her youth to protest the Vietnam War  &mdash;  the scene shows actual footage of Madame Dukakis sobbing at a press conference trying in vain to refute Atwater&rsquo;s accusations.  Whether she burned the flag or not was irrelevant  &mdash;  Atwater tossed it out there to shake up his opponent and tie up their valuable time, resources and energy  trying to disprove his accusation, which (as Atwater well knew) was impossible.</p>
<p>Exactly what the Democrats are doing these days to the Tea Partiers  by tossing accusations of racism at them.</p>
<p>That Atwater got result is not in dispute.</p>
<p>Now, Republican candidates, for fear of being called &#8216;racist&rsquo;, refuse to go on the offensive.  The following is from James Edward&rsquo;s new book Racism, Schmacism: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;John McCain lost, and he lost badly, because he decided it was better to lose the election than to be called a racist, no matter how unfounded the charges. So he went around denouncing people associated with his campaign who dared refer to Barack Hussein Obama by his legal name, and he denounced an ad run by a state GOP group that featured Jeremiah Wright screaming &#8216;God damn America!&rsquo; And what good did it do him? Not a bit. All the cowardice he displayed in a desperate attempt to avoid being called the &ldquo;R-word&rdquo; was for nothing&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Am I an admirer of Atwater?  Yes.  He believed in going on the offensive, never backing down, mounting counterattacks and fighting fire with fire.  It is the only way to get results in the current political climate  &mdash;  as the Dems well know.</p>
<p>But I also strongly believe this:</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&rsquo;t a dime&rsquo;s worth of difference between the Democrats and Republicans!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Webb is a Democratic Senator.  One can&rsquo;t help but notice that Republican politicians have been extremely adverse to criticizing anti-white discrimination for the last 15 years or so, as have the &#8220;conservative&#8221; pundits and media personalities.  It&rsquo;s like there was some conspiracy to make affirmative action disappear as an issue when it used to be one of the big causes for conservative voters.  </p>

		<p>There are many statistics in Jim Webb&rsquo;s piece that could be very revealing if they were expanded into a historical analysis.  One of the several is the stats of education among white protestants by the mid 20th century.  A look into the history of Reconstruction and Post Reconstruction South will illustrate how the education systems of the South were harmed by the Federal Government that was out of punish the South and end all resistences.  The Fed also allowed a land grab that saw a few people end up owning most of the land by defaults on plots that saw sharecropping increase.  It was the dust bowl and Depression that led to the collapse of the Sharecropping system.  By 1900, most whites were subsistence farming.  Families barely able to survive can hardly be expected to do more than be able to basically read and write.  In 1900, illiteracy was higher in the South than in antebellumm times among all races.  So ignorant had the South become in general that even when palegra was common, no one did anything about it and officials resisted a Jewish doctors experiments that proved that the typical poor Southern meal that excluded vegetables (niacin) was the cause of all the suffering.  That Jew, Dr. Joseph Goldberger later became a hero.  Similarly, Jews had been the first to bring any reasonably priced goods to people in the South after the war and today, the Atlanta based Macy&rsquo;s department stores are the remants of that history.  But somehow, the good works of Jews on behalf of white Southerners is completely supplanted by theories of a Jewish world conspiracy.  This is because in bad times, religion gains and reason wanes.  And with superstition and fear, the need for a scapegoat seems to always arise.  This tendancy is being exploited by our enemies today, because alarms we raise today sound like we&rsquo;re crying wolf once again.</p>
<p>The plays of Tennessee Williams and some other early works and films are markers that illustrate some of these conditions.  In A Streetcar Named Desire, we see in the film, what could be Scarlet O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s granddaughter, driven mad at last by the ravages of Reconstruction on the old social order.  &#8220;Streetcar&#8221; has been repeated millions of times in America today, only with a black Stanley Koswalski.  How many other now old plays and films do we see the theme?  The old delapadated plantation home, a woman, beaufiful, but made ignorant and vulnarable by the loss of culture, due to explicit Federal directive, collapsing and giving in at last to the inevitable muck of degradation and exploitation?  I am very interested in what plays and films might be waiting that depict today&rsquo;s ongoing &#8220;next stage.&#8221;  That is because we may rightly see in the current administration, a resumption of extremist Reconstruction ideals and aims.  If the aim of AA is to give every black in existence a leg up over any white, as it seems to be implying, even by Jim Webb in this article, the aim has to be nothing short than an extended festival of misrule; a celebration of emancipation long put off by resistors.  But today, the grandchildren of &#8220;Streetcar&rsquo;s&#8221; generation have become programed into an appearance of sanity while they participate actively in their own debaching and extinction.</p>
<p>But the cracks are beginning to show.  Last week, a young beautiful white woman was sentenced to 20 to life for stabbing to death another beautiful young white woman over a mixed race male who not only dated them, but any others that came within his grasp.  Women, especially white women have been reaping great rewards due to AA in the past 40 years.  In my area, women dominate every government postion, even the sherrif&rsquo;s department.  Even the streetsweeper operators are female.  Only things like garbage trucks are operated by men.  But now women are turing on one another.  The dog-eat-dog world that used to be the realm of the white man, who mostly were governed by a modicum of business and chivalric ethics (since most were either Freemasons, Rotarians or some other behavior improving organization), is dominated by women who are now finding a new theater for the kind of female competitions that used to be confined to gossip over a fence or in a school lunchroom.  More and more women are the principal breadwinners in familes with increasingly emasculated males in secondary roles.  This has increased hte rate of marriage failures.  In regions like NYC or SF, women are often single mothers who date for entertainment, a&rsquo; la &#8220;Sex in the City&#8221; or &#8220;Desperate Housewives.&#8221;  They are doing all this without the ethics and values that used to accompany men in their roles.  Today, most men - (certainly the ones I know of) have lost themselves in a world of distraction, where they can still have the illusion of being men.  Whether it is as Sports fans or NASCAR, or the Harley in the garage, men are lost, looking for themselves in an escape from a world that no longer values them.</p>
<p>Long winded again, but I spent this time to try to show why for example the women who may be reading need to understand why some of the traditional arrangements were important.  Parents used to protect young women until they were suitably married and prepared for life.  This didn&rsquo;t mean that they had no opportunities.  History is actually loaded with heroic women.  But today, every woman has been sold the notion that they are THE one who needs to go out and do everything any man ever did.  Take a look everyone, at those races and ethnic groups that have the most numbers of newborn.  What they have in common is a love of family and a basic structure that honors women in the roles that they are most naturally suited. </p>
<p>I think that we will continue to see the West collapse until the majority of the people are actually forced to return to their homes and survive.  The problem of whites is that they became too independent of one another.</p>

<p>We are soon headed for serious racial turmoil in this country. The battlegrounds will fall to the states. Arizona is just a start, but a start way too late.  Hard to have sympathy for somebody who starts to put out the fire after the fire has burned before their eyes for decades and they just watched it hoping somebody else would come along and save them.</p>
<p>I have no pity on Arizona, but I sort of admire their moxy, but I don&rsquo;t trust they really mean it either.  It&rsquo;s all a big mess, one way or another.  Arizona only becomes really important if a group of other states follow soon and do the right thing with copy cat laws.  But what is taking them so long.  Their delay makes them despicable right now and only slightly less so if they get the job done for their citizens in passing the law.<br>

		<p>My girlfriend and I  tried to spread some White Privilege correctness last week, but I&rsquo;m afraid we may have failed.  </p>
<p>Or maybe my comment will go to work on the two White Parents with the Very White, Very Blonde, Very Blue Eyed Baby.</p>
<p>Both parents were painted with fabulously light White skin and had blue eyes, and the White Mother claimed Welsh blood. Her eyes were almost a see through sky blue with hints of grey. Light reddish hair. Looked to me like a Scotsmen spent must have spent  his frisky vacation in Cambria about 28 years and nine months ago, if ya know wha&rsquo; I&rsquo;m say&rsquo;n.  I&rsquo;m juss say&rsquo;n.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I complemented their baby, and then said, &#8220;You know, starting next year, babies who look like that will be a minority in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The White parents surprised and disappointed me.  I was surprised they didn&rsquo;t protest my racist comment said right over their little baby, but I was disappointed that they just said &#8220;Really?&#8221; in sort of an honestly ignorant way.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t they know? Don&rsquo;t they worry?? Don&rsquo;t they care???</p>
<p>  Maybe her White Maternal instincts will be awakened by my comment and she will start to obsess, fret, and plan- plan to defend the White Privilege she is bequeathing to her beautiful baby.</p>
<p>We can only pray that my one Race Reality comment will go to work inside of her, and then for her, in the days and weeks to come.  </p>
<p>I realize that I&rsquo;m no &#8220;subtle doctor&#8221; in the style that Richard Weaver cast John Crowe Ransom, as my girlfriend constantly reminds me, but aw foot, I sure do try, and I try just for you, dearest!</p>

But where&rsquo;s the hope of that the White Mother will eventually do the right thing by responding the my prompting?  Even though she was in a White neighborhood restaurant, she&rsquo;s raising here White Child in a majority non white city.  Doesn&rsquo;t that rise to the definition of child abuse and race betrayal?</p>
<p>Do you think I would have gone too far if I just started with this?</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us be clear on one point. The White man owes the [blacks] nothing. If there are any debts outstanding, they are owed by the [blacks] to the White man. The [blacks owe] the White man<br>

		<p>It seems to me that if this Webb actually believed in ending White discrimination that there would be some history of a voting record on intrinsically White issues to prove it.  I can&rsquo;t find anything. Nada. He must have all of a sudden had a revelation to defend White America or this is just a ploy to win White votes.  I&rsquo;ll take door number 2.  It&rsquo;s odd that there&rsquo;s no criticism from the Obama administration over this story and the fact he&rsquo;s married to an oriental woman and they have a mixed race daughter makes it incredulous.  Notice how he was careful in saying that diversity programs should continue for blacks in &#8220;need&#8221;.  If this is some kind of progressive White advocacy, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a bit watered down and weak for my tastes.  Real reform will come from the larger right wing political elements (the real right) that represent the majority of Whites.       </p>

<p>White Privilege isn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;ve been told.</p>
<p>White Privilege is the privilege of race traitor Whites who call anyone else who notices and mentions minority race hypocrisy a racist,  and then avoids being completely banished from public life.  White Privilege protects White Liberal Elites from the consequences of Race Reality.</p>
<p>If White Privilege falls, they need to fall with it first. How can we make that happen?</p>
<p>Now Howard Screaming Dean  says FoxNews is racist.  Good. Means FoxNews will keep after race stories just to prove they aren&rsquo;t.  </p>

<p>Dean dismissed Wallace&rsquo;s point about timing, asserting &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t do your job,&rdquo; and charging that Fox News has helped the Republican Party foster racism by focusing on allegations of reverse racism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tea party called out their racist fringe and I think the Republican Party&rsquo;s got to stop appealing to its racist fringe. And Fox News is what did that. You put that on,&rdquo; Dean said. &ldquo;Continuing to cater to this theme of minority racism and stressing comments like this – some of which are taken out of context – does not help the country knit itself together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>end snip</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Foster racism&#8221; translation:  1) Any news story that includes blacks and does not emphasize the need for Whites to atone for the sins of segregation by holding themselves accountable to people of color for their unearned White privilege. 2) Any news story that shows Whites what blacks really are (Race Realism) and does not soften the story by turning it against Whites. 3) Any news story that gives Whites more reasons to be righteously angry about what has been done to them by the White Elites and the Diversity Privileged blacks. 4) Any story that makes Whites rethink Civil Rights and long for the return of Jim Crown. 5) Any story that makes good copy on Amren. 6) White skin, especially on White babies. 7)The Internet. </p>
<p><br>
The Dems are in a panic that Whites are now focusing on minority racism.  They know that if enough Whites find unity around that one issue, it means votes for Republicans and the potential roll back of many of the programs that keep White Dems in power through black votes.  That&rsquo;s why they must shut down dissent on FoxNews and the Internet.  Dissent means toxic and viral anger, which means lost votes for them.</p>
<p>Deeper than that material aspect, the spiritual edifice side starts to fall apart when Whites see how they&rsquo;ve been scapegoated into dispossession.  </p>
<p>The more we get to know blacks and the more we see and hear confirmation that our suspicious about them aren&rsquo;t unethical prejudice but are God given instinct, we become less willing to &#8220;do more&#8221; for them.  </p>
<p>The liberals know that they simply cannot afford a moral White Revolt.  The only identity Whites are allowed is one of moral depravity and thus in need of redemption through atonement via Affirmative Action and Diversity Privilege.</p>
<p>Kevin MacDonald gets it right:  https://tinyurl.com/255w3ob</p>
<p> &#8220;In large part the problem confronting Whites stems from our psychology of moralistic self-punishment exemplified at the extreme by the Puritans and their intellectual descendants, but also apparent in a great many other Whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minority racism shown of FoxNews lessens our willingness to volunteer or submit to &#8220;moralistic self-punishment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only a racist White wouldn&rsquo;t want moralistic self-punishment for the sake of the blacks. Thus, FoxNews is turning White America into a bunch of racist bigots.</p>
<p>To be not a racist bigot, Whites must now say you hate racist FoxNews and look forward to voting for Obama again.</p>
<p>Actually, the left is making it too easy on us.  Instead of going through the atonement process, just call FoxNews racist and everybody will leave you alone because you will be a &#8220;good&#8221; White.<br>

		<p>Actually if you red the Wall Street Journal article more closely, Webb does not advocate ending Affirmative Action. He argues that the level of government intervention in diversity based programs should be curtailed. Otherwise he supports the policy in general.</p>
<p>Secondly, as another poster mentioned, his voting record would indicate to anyone that he is a moderate who often goes left.<br>

<p>This is the liberal equivalent of the Apostle&rsquo;s Creed or the Shema. It is the Credo of our controlled media and privileged elites. Your success or failure in academia or government employment is directly linked to adherence to this &#8220;diversity creed.&#8221; Those who reject the diversity creed are heretics worthy of being ostracized or punished.<br>

Dyson: Far-Right Addicted to Paranoia About Race</p>
<p>Georgetown Professor Says Obama Admin. Scared of Tea Party; Cornel West Says Real Race Issue Is Poverty</p>
<p>&#8220;The Obama administration has been intimidated by the far-right wing, which is addicted to a kind of paranoia of race that then leads to paralyzing racial conversation,&#8221; Rev. Michael Eric Dyson, a professor of sociology at Georgetown University and an author of many books on African-American issues, said.</p>
<p><br>
He&rsquo;s right, we are addicted to race paranoia (i.e. Race Realism) but he also didn&rsquo;t tell us why we shouldn&rsquo;t be paranoid. His withholding of exculpatory evidence is suspicious. Sort of like Boas putting race reality in a text book, and then removing that passage in a subsequent printing without giving any evidence of the discovered Equality that replaced his  prior understanding.   But he got away with it, because we have Brown v. Board as the Integration Law of the Land.</p>
<p>Dyson using the typical SPLC/ADL trick.  Make out normal Race Realist Whites to be dangerous psychos with mental problems.</p>
<p>Nobody in their right mind would possibly fear the blacks!</p>
<p>We are entering a time of open and severe racial division in this country, and it&rsquo;s coming far too late to do any good.</p>
<p>But at least we can rejoice that one byproduct will be that a few more White Girls will no longer say &#8220;They&rsquo;re just like us.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Now the White Privilege Press is keeping Sherrod out of the spotlight. They don&rsquo;t want to stoke more &#8220;race paranoia&#8221; in us by showing that she is  a &#8220;typical black&#8221; who hates whitey for profit.</p>
<p>She seems like a self aggrandizing ghetto queen, so I assume she won&rsquo;t just disappear.  Dear Great Media God, can we please have more of her this week? </p>

<p>Considering the Shirley Sherrod interview barrage that took place last Thursday, to not see Sherrod on television Sunday morning sends a clear signal the mainstream media no longer feels allowing the public to get to know the real Shirley Sherrod advances their agenda.</p>
<p>Last week, Charles Krauthammer pointed out that while Sgt. Crowley got a beer summit after Obama merely (and mistakenly) said he &ldquo;acted stupidly,&rdquo; Shirley Sherrod got just a seven-minute phone call after she was forced to resign.  The White House and the Obama Administration who hastily relieved her of her position were already keeping her at arms length, and now the mainstream media is too.</p>

<p>There are two reasons whites are awakening to the reasons for black failure.</p>
<p>1. Evidence of Asian dominance in prestigious universities (UCLA 50% Asian) demonstrates that it is possible for non-whites to succeed in America.</p>
<p>2. The election of a black president.</p>
<p>**************************<br>
Oh hang the Asians!  UCLA has a bunch of Asians because they&rsquo;re on the West Coast and California is the first place they come to.  People keep talking about Asians being more intelligent.  Look at the societies they&rsquo;ve left.  </p>
<p>China - overpopulation, 1.3 Billion people; <br>
incredible pollution; <br>
eating fetuses; <br>
killing dogs; <br>
Communist regime, etc.<br>
And China doesn&rsquo;t even have a race problem</p>
<p>USA - White men - <br>
crossed 3,000 miles of ocean to settle in and tame a continent; defeated the Indians; <br>
made the greatest medical and scientific discoveries the world has ever known;<br>
went to the moon</p>
<p>Let me tell you something &#8216;Anonymous&rsquo;, we don&rsquo;t need anything but our own two eyes and ears to see that Blacks are not intelligent by and large and are certainly not as intelligent as Whites are.  I knew it when I was a kid - and so did you and every other White person.  We don&rsquo;t need Asians invading this country and a Black president to tell us what White men knew hundreds of years ago and what every one of us knows instinctively.</p>

Secession without war will only work if:<br>
1.  It comes with control over nuclear forces.  Those are the only weapons which have the ability to forestall repossession by force.  And the cost to be worth negotiating for.  Look to the Ukraine and Russia to see how well that is working.  Unable to leave the sphere of influence that is Russian dependence on Ukrainian agro, still the Ukrainians become more &#8216;western&rsquo; by the year.</p>
<p>2.  It comes with sufficient industrial and infrastructure networking as to keep whites enabled by our innate individualist need to stand up and be noted for our excellence.  At it&rsquo;s most basic, this means warm water ports, agro assurances and links to other white states with the ability to cross cover each other.</p>
<p>3.  Absolute Demographic Dominance.  Too much of where we are at is based on the assumption that you can&rsquo;t neglect what is &#8216;already there&rsquo; and if you don&rsquo;t want to contribute to the problems resolution or &#8216;integration&rsquo; into a larger society, you must instead accept without say those solutions which others put into play.  This more than any other element is what white racial preference &#8216;sleep&rsquo; is about.  A deliberate desire not to deal with the problem by _expelling it_ is inherent to getting on with one&rsquo;s life and that may mean obligating funds to buy out racial minorities at a million dollars per family.  It certainly means controlling immigration (from other State populations) with the same zero-tolerance policy.  Anything else will send whites into a frenzy of indecision and worry which is the real basis of &#8216;white guilt&rsquo;.</p>
<p>You should not depend on white military values to drive support.  Look at post-WWI demands for recompense and the brutal suppression of protestors in WDC, _by other military personnel_.<br>
They live their own lifestyle and set of rules which is almost totally twisted by top-down command and early induction brainwashing.  They are, in many ways, the perfect micro-macro model of white dominance deliberately acting submissive in the presence of a strong &#8216;ordering&rsquo; culture.</p>
<p>@44<br>
If you have white moral values in play (thou shalt work, thou shalt pay, thou shalt be civically responsible) as a function of state assistance in getting together a house and standard of living, you ABSOLUTELY MUST NOT accede to the Asian, African and Middle Eastern concepts of &#8216;family over ethics&rsquo;.  Either in supporting a welfare system that applies standards unequally to minorities.  Or in insisting on a communal existence.  Women either will or will not come into the fold based on their abilities and desires to be part of a white populace.  If need be, there is a technical solution to womb infertility.  But there is also simply too much evidence that what makes us loyal to a standard as much as each other is not inherent to &#8216;family values&rsquo; but rather to a common set of goals which -personally- advantage us.</p>
<p>Where race is extended family and every nation which has too much of that mental incestuousness as first loyalty has FAILED to develop a rigourous social conscience, advanced technology or high culture; we cannot afford to become like our enemies.</p>
<p>If nothin else it is the first step to becoming ant-like in our dependence on 6-7 working age family units that contribute to a much lowered earnings status overall, based on the false notion that &#8216;in contributing to the group, we leave something for ourselves&rsquo;.  Which flat out isn&rsquo;t true because it puts all the power into property owner hierarchy that is nothing if not tribal.  For whites to succeed, we need the freedom and encouragement to spread out and explore our own fates.  Whether this means through a patriarchal system which gives males enough economic power to &#8216;trickle down&rsquo; benefits to social-role fixed dependents, or through a co-equivalent gender system (meritocracy) that uses exogenics to make up for female refusal of maternity; we cannot afford to become so isolated in our own group mentality, as a reflection of other races worst shortcoming, that we lose the innate white advantage of high individualism as self-identity. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;The injustices endured by black Americans at the hands of their own government have no parallel in our history, not only during the period of slavery but also in the Jim Crow era that followed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were slaves and not all of them were treated poorly. This has been well documented but the MSM hides these facts especially from the younger generations who are pretty much brainwashed. Ditto with the mayhem the Marxists and other liberals played during the civil rights movement down South (going down to Alabama and having black males/northern white females copulate on courthouse steps or blacks and northern whites urinating in the streets of Montgomery).  I bet you some white have never heard of this until this post!  Many journalists were outraged that the stories they sent back North were being totally changed.</p>
<p>The blacks here are far better off than the descendents of the ones that returned to Africa (Liberia) or the descendents of the ones that remained in Africa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond our continuing obligation to assist those African-Americans still in need, government-directed diversity programs should end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What continuing obligation? You mean Dems obligation for the black vote! I don&rsquo;t believe any non-elite, white Americans owe black Americans anything. White Americans have more than paid their share of sacrifices! At this point blacks need to elevate themselves on their own. What is this constant need for white help anyway?</p>
<p>The only white American Webb is looking out for is himself. Read between the lines. He is probably a front man for a clique of Dems looking to retain power. Most politicians are whores and always have been. We already know most of them aren&rsquo;t even good Americans.</p>

<p>God bless Breitbart, even if he is a neocon Republican shill.  Beyond the material effect of his ongoing race news, which is measured in increased Republican vote counts, the ongoing effect on our White Communities won&rsquo;t go away after the next election.</p>
<p>Once Whites are justified in their prejudices through current minority racism stories, the newly awakened prejudices don&rsquo;t go away.  We will remain acute and aware, because blacks won&rsquo;t go away and will continue acting black and confirming all our suspicions about them.</p>
<p>Every typically divisive and hatemongering black behavior only confirms the rightness of the American Colonization Society and the goodness of Jim Crow Segregation.</p>
<p>If we are to atone, it must for being members of the White Humanity that chose race suicide over race survival and race destiny.  Our ongoing burden of history is in the acknowledgement of what our own people did to us for the benefit of Africans in America.  </p>
<p>Jim Crow had been a huge surge in the right direction.  It&rsquo;s untimely and shameful rollback is our demise.</p>
<p>Whites are beginning to re develop a long lost sense of Race Unity.  Watch for the attacks on us to escalate.  The Left can&rsquo;t afford White Anger to coalesce into White Unity and White Votes for White Conservatives.</p>
<p>They must ramp up the pressure against us. They are in a panic.  Now that Whites are awake, the anti White tactics will backfire, much to our delight and hope.  Amren will be busy. </p>

<p>As a beneficiary of White Privilege, I consecrate myself to White Prejudice, which is nothing more than the God given instinct of self preservation in a nation of Whites ruled by blacks and their White Elite enablers.</p>
<p>White Privilege gives action to reason. White Prejudice is ready application in the upcoming Race Emergency, i.e. Diversity&rsquo;s Critical Mass and Inevitable Chaos.</p>
<p>Prejudice renders the virtue of White Privilege our habit of self preservation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of our men of speculation, instead of exploding general prejudices, employ their sagacity to discover the latent wisdom which prevails in them. If they find what they seek, (and they seldom fail) they think it more wise to continue the prejudice, with the reason involved, than to cast away the coat of prejudice, and to leave nothing but the naked-reason;  because prejudice, with its reason, has a motive to give action to that reason, and an affection which will give it permanence. Prejudice is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, sceptical, puzzled, and unresolved. Prejudice renders a man&rsquo;s virtue his habit; and not a series of unconnected acts. Through just prejudice, his duty becomes a part of his nature.&#8221;</p>
