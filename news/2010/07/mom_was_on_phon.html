<h1>Mom Was on Phone With Jupiter Man When Robbers Killed Him in Baltimore</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cynthia Roldan, Palm Beach Post, July 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Baltimore police say John Wagner and Lavelva Merritt were &#8220;hunting to rob someone&#8221; on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Around 11:30, they ran into Stephen Pitcairn.</p>
<p>The Jupiter man, a Johns Hopkins University researcher with dreams of finding the cure to breast cancer, was walking on Baltimore&rsquo;s north side talking on the phone with his mother.</p>
<p>Wagner and Merritt found their perfect, distracted &#8220;someone,&#8221; police said in court records filed Tuesday .</p>
<p>Even after he followed the two career criminals&rsquo; orders, police allege that one of them stabbed him in the chest. All the while his mother, Gwen Pitcairn, listened as her son  &mdash;  just two days shy of his 24th birthday  &mdash;  pleaded with the robbers .</p>
<p>Afterward, the pair went home, apparently so proud of what they had done they bragged to witnesses, saying they had robbed and &#8220;hurt&#8221; a &#8220;white boy,&#8221; according to the court records.</p>
<p>Pitcairn was pronounced dead around midnight at John Hopkins Hospital.</p>
<p>On Monday morning, a police SWAT team raided Wagner and Merritt&rsquo;s place at 2700 Baltimore Ave. and arrested the pair without incident. Police found blood at the front door, bloody shoes and Pitcairn&rsquo;s brown wallet and iPhone in the house.</p>
<p>After being taken in for questioning, Merritt and Wagner gave statements that were &#8220;completely contradictory to one another,&#8221; police say.</p>
<p>Wagner, 34, and Merritt, 24, are expected to be arraigned this morning on murder, robbery and assault charges, according to the court records.</p>

		<p>Smart of the cops to interrogate the two suspects separately to see if their stories lined up (which they obviously didn&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, thanks to liberalism, the two perps will probably be given an all-too-brief sentence  &mdash;  with time off for &#8220;good behavior.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is heart-breaking sad.  Two worse-than-useless &#8220;career criminals&#8221; destroy the life of someone who (1) was innocent; (2) did nothing to them whatsoever; and (3) had all appearances of being a benefit to society.  The absolute worst thing about this is that the perps will not get the death penalty (quite deserved), and even if they did, they&rsquo;ll probably be on death row longer than this young man lived (24 years.  And the taxpayers of Maryland will pay their upkeep.</p>

		<p>In MD, homicide during the course of a robbery (among other felonies) is capital murder.  Both these creeps will be eligible for the death penalty, no matter which did the killing.  They&rsquo;re both career criminals, and though a partly black Baltimore jury may keep them from riding the needle, they will probably get the next strongest sentence.  Some states, like OH, no longer have &#8220;good time&#8221;.  I didn&rsquo;t take time to check on MD.</p>

		<p>I recognize the victim&hellip; cause he used to be me!!  Walking with a cell phone, unaware of his surroundings &hellip;Sensing the threat, but not acting on it, cause to do so would be racist. And finally probably pleading for his life and possesions in a good naturedly way right into the grave. <br/>

<p>I&rsquo;m certain that the governmedia splashed this story of flagrant Racism across every channel, 24/7, for the past week.  So how come I missed it?  Surely such an important story of Racial Hatred wasn&rsquo;t limited to the <i>Palm Beach Post</i>.</p>

		<p>This story really irks me. This young man and his mother couldn&rsquo;t even mind their own business without being targeted by these two dim-witted blacks. I hope the law comes down really hard on those street urchins.</p>
<p>This is exactly the reason for the genesis of white flight from cities to affluent suburbs first taking root up north. Blacks up that way got an extra bad attitude and many white suburbanites won&rsquo;t even go to cities like Baltimore unless they absolutely have to. Who can blame them? </p>
<p>Been to Baltimore and the sections I saw reminded me of photos of Dresden Geramany, fire- bombed by the allies in February, 1945. But at least Dresden was a Germanic white city and was still better off than Baltimore even after is was bombed to ruins. </p>

		<p>A few years ago I read about an young employee at Johns Hopkins hospital that was robbed and stomped to death by a gang of black teenagers near his home.  His new wife was so thoroughly disgusted by the Baltimore &#8220;justice&#8221; system that she started a pressure group to demand the light sentences given to violent teen criminals be halted.  She was dragged through the dirt by the black criminals that run Baltimore and basically told that &#8220;this is how it is in Bmore.&#8221;  </p>
<p>This case reminds me of that.  That said I just don&rsquo;t understand some people&rsquo;s mindset when out walking at night.  Did the victim think that black crime was something that wasn&rsquo;t really all that bad or overblown by people that watch Fox news?  Did he not know that Baltimore is one of the most dangerous cities in the US and has seen hundreds of crimes like this committed?  I just can&rsquo;t imagine his mother being on the other end of the line and listening while two racist black murderers killed her son.    </p>

		<p>When a white boy got on the public address system in a NJ Wal-Mart all h@ll broke out.  The news media couldn&rsquo;t get enough of this prank..ooops, I mean horrible, racist hate crime of unforgivable proportions.  But when a young white researcher from Johns Hopkins is murdered senselessly while talking to his mother on the phone, something that poor woman will NEVER get over, it is kept hush hush.  I am sure the two perp&rsquo;s mothers will plead for their good boy/girl&rsquo;s life at sentencing with abundant histrionics!<br/>

No civilization can endure that does not look at its members and value them differently: thugs are worthless and scientists valuable. But if you look at the way that our government spends our tax money, it seems that so much of it is spent to make the most worthless thugs flourish. Now, why is that?</p>

		<p>Typical story. Two nothing to lose lowlife types kill a young person with promise. I&rsquo;d like to see the rap sheets of these two. And at their ages of 24 and 34 this can&rsquo;t be the first victim of theirs. What haven&rsquo;t they been caught for? One problem is that they&rsquo;ll probably feel right at home in prison. </p>

		<p>I live in Maryland but fortunately far away enough from the Baltimore thugs that commit these crimes. Of course, our local news media is not reporting this as a hate crime at all. There is no mention of that fact that he was called a &#8220;white boy&#8221; by his executioners (and was no doubt targeted in the first place simply because he was white). We all know that if it had been the other way around, Jesse and Al would be on the rampage and the entire story would have national coverage. </p>
<p>I feel so sad for the victim and his family. While murders of students are not as common, white and Asian students/workers in the city are victimized EVERY DAY by these black thugs whether it be sexual assault, robbery, etc. Soon after I graduated college, I naively took a job working at the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, in an area that I thought would be relatively safe given its proximity to a major university. I should have known better than to take the job after finding out that I would have to walk a very long distance from the parking garage to my office but I took the job anyway. After suffering a sexual assault (thankfully non-violent), I QUIT IMMEDIATELY&hellip; oh, and I forgot to mention how black thugs would beg me for money every day by telling elaborate sob stories, ask for sexual favors and drive very fast and recklessly through pedestrian walkways. Anyway&hellip;</p>
<p>It is a true shame that Johns Hopkins and other prestigious universities in Baltimore are surrounded by these cockroaches. The victim in this case may have gone on to do truly great things for humanity but his life was snuffed out because two low IQ imbeciles couldn&rsquo;t control their urge to kill and to HATE (but of course according to the left, whites are the true haters!) </p>

		<p>If one is in or close to a black neighborhood, one should take certain precautions.  Do not be outside after dark unless absolutely necessary.  Do not use a cell phone while walking.  Avoid deserted environments.  Avoid the approach of young black men.  You should particularly avoid letting young black men get behind you.  Cross the street.  Change direction.  Go back inside, lock the door, and prepare to call the police.  They are not all dangerous.  Enough are to avoid taking chances.<br/>
 <br/>
In one of his skits Michael Moore had a black physician wearing a suit and a white ex con dressed in scruffy clothes try to hail cabs in New York city.  All the cabs picked up the white ex con.  The skit would have been less funny, and more profound if Moore&rsquo;s skit had shown the races of the cab drivers.  I am confident some of them were black.  <br/>
 <br/>
Once a black cab driver from Uganda drove me through the Washington, DC area.  Without any prompting from me he told me which neighborhoods he liked working in and which neighborhoods he was afraid of.  The safe neighborhoods were all white.  The dangerous neighborhoods were all black.</p>

		<p>There is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery. Then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved&hellip;. After all we have been through. Just to think we can&rsquo;t walk down our own streets, how humiliating. <br/>

		<p>You mean to tell me that all the police have for evidence is the victims blood all over the suspects&rsquo; shoes and front door, the victim&rsquo;s phone and wallet in the the suspects&rsquo; house, and a bunch of witnesses who say that these two bragged to them about hurting and robbing a White Boy, and those running dogs of the imperialist oppressors had the audacity to dash right out and invade this couple&rsquo;s home and lock them up like criminals?

		<p>It&rsquo;s the knowledge that this kind of random, racially motivated murder can happen to any white person in his or her home, anywhere that motivates me to keep loaded guns where I can get them in a heartbeat. It gives me the will to utterly destroy anyone attacking me and mine while we are in our own home. I have no qualms whatsoever about using them on intruders, who are overwhelmingly likely to be non-white trash here in Alabama. My neighbor was surprised by a black man breaking into her home, luckily he ran off before she was raped, injured or killed in front of her two children. Intruders will be shot, survivors will be finished off should be the new mantra for all whites when facing non-whites looking to murder one or more of us.</p>

		<p>I wonder what was the cash value of he money in Pitcairn&rsquo;s wallet.<br/>
I wager that it was a trivial amount, no more than $100.<br/>
 Yet these animals slaughtered a man for that trivial sum.Just think about that - just think of the primitive reptilian brain capable of making such a calculation.<br/>
 In a sane society these animals would be gunned down with little due process at once.<br/>
 No, but in the good ol&rsquo; US of A they&rsquo;ll get trial after trial, expendsive public prosectors lying through teir teeth and playing verbal histrionics to some dumb jury, apeal after appeal and if they are not acquiited by their fellow racial warriors on a loaded jury, they&rsquo;ll get lifetime food and lodging at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars per annum of US taxpayers&rsquo; money (money taken from hard pressed families), for life.</p>

		<p>I live in Florida and have survived major riots and the aftermath of hurricanes.  I learned at an early age to not only be aware of my surroundings but to be well armed.  In Fl and some 40 or so states that recognize my concealed carry permit I am at least able to fight back.  The other states?  Well let&rsquo;s just say I am still well armed.  My family know how to handle a firearm as well.  And if my dog could use one, I&rsquo;d give her one too.</p>

		<p>What I want to know is when we are going to begin striking back?<br/>
Every law abiding person should be carrying a weapon (they have over/under Derringers that can be carried in your pants pocket)<br/>
 after he/she has been completely trained in its use. Instead of destroying brain cells in front of your big screen TVs, join a local firing range and practice. Take a tactical firearms course.<br/>
We are at war people! They&rsquo;re laying off police! Even at full strength for the most part they show up AFTER you&rsquo;re dead, raped or both. It&rsquo;s every White man/woman for him/her self.<br/>
They stand on street corners calling our women whores and exhorting other Blacks to kill our babies! They abuse our old folks in nursing homes.  How much more motivation do we need before we begin to take action?<br/>
Get to know your neighbors. Form neighborhood watches and protect yourselves. We&rsquo;re back in the days of the frontier and we have to defend against enemies from within AND from without.</p>

		<p>Once again an innocent white is &#8220;lynched&#8221; because of the color of his skin. Begging for mercy from animals like these only makes them more likely to kill their victims. As I have written in previous posts; when traveling in certain areas, one must enter with the mind set of entering a war zone. And not just any war zone, but one where you are likely to be targeted due to your race. Rarely do I travel these war zones anymore, but if I must, I travel with the expectation that I may have to fight for my life. It&rsquo;s going to get worse before it gets better. These war zones are spreading. The Obamamedia does not want the general public to be aware of these attacks. They want the public to drink beer, worship professional sports and remain oblivious. Get your CCW permit. Get training in all types of close quarter combat. Refuse to be a victim.</p>

Once returned to society, they will be a hero in their &#8220;hood.&#8221;  They will then be able to return to a life of crime.

		<p>Georgia Institute of Technology is located inside Atlanta. The black criminals in this area use it for a hunting ground, attacking and robbing students even on the campus grounds. Atlanta has long been known by law enforcement as a haven for black criminals. You won&rsquo;t read anything about this in the Atlanta newspapers. My very large family once lived in Atlanta. We long ago fled to the suburbs where the federal government is now trying to relocate Atlanta blacks, and the rise in crime here has followed the rise in the number of blacks here. <br/>
It&rsquo;s too bad, but I&rsquo;m sure this white cancer researcher and his mother were very politically correct whites who never knew the danger of being brainwashed.  </p>

		<p>This article reminds me of stories I read every day in the South African (White) press.  It&rsquo;s gotten so bad there that &#8220;everyone knows a relative or friend who has been killed or at least subjected to some form of violent crime, and no South African can remotely imagine a society where people do not live behind razor wire, electrified fences, high walls, burglar bars and similar decorative props.</p>
<p>The [SA] media are celebrating youth, dance, colour, being black and exuberant – as opposed to the quiet studiousness of middle-aged and elderly whites, the bearers of knowledge and understanding. These learned whites are being killed in exuberant, paradisiacal outbreaks of violence&hellip;No government spokesman has ever condemned such killings; so we may assume that the present regime is completely indifferent to them.</p>
<p>The government has recently passed a new gun law which makes it difficult, if not impossible, to own a firearm.  As a result of the new gun law&hellip; we shall simply be able to hide or flee from our assailants. Defending oneself against a marauding robber or rapist might be a manifestation of racism, and is therefore frowned upon as being a kind of &#8216;right-wing&rsquo; response&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>See any parallels with American society?   Any lessons to be learned?  Is this Native Born White Americans&rsquo; future when we are a minority? </p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Intruders will be shot, survivors will be finished off should be the new mantra for all whites when facing non-whites looking to murder one or more of us&hellip;We are at war people! They&rsquo;re laying off police! Even at full strength for the most part they show up AFTER you&rsquo;re dead, raped or both. It&rsquo;s every White man/woman for him/her self&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyone ANYONE attacking me, my home or my loved ones will be met with deadly force.  If enough blacks get the message that we Whites will fight back, and without mercy, they may not be so quick to attack us.</p>
<p>Deadly force is the only answer when faced with violent criminals.   They understand nothing except the business end of a firearm.  It WILL be either YOU and your loved ones or THEM.  We didn&rsquo;t survive ice ages, famines, murderous depots, plagues only to be slaughtered helplessly like sheep by murderous blacks or any other non-White.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take my life and that of my loved ones, pets included down to my two fish tanks, over extending them the benefit of the doubt. If you don&rsquo;t provide protection for yourself and loved ones who will?  The police?  The government?</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t been paying attention.</p>
<p>And Spread the Word.  I believe the story above will become more and more common as we become a minority.  We will be hunted and killed, while the media yawns and the government legislates to disarm us and steal our wealth.</p>
<p>And finally, please don&rsquo;t call me a &#8216;pessimist&rsquo; as some on here have.  Is it not better to be prepared just in case the future isn&rsquo;t quite as rosy as some on here think it will be for us Whites?  All empirical evidence, especially since the Obama regime, especially here in California where the economy IS collapsing, does not point toward an era of prosperity and peace for Whites. </p>

<p>Indeed it is. I can well identify with that naive young victim. The same experiences have happened to me, a number of times in fact, and I realize I am just very, very lucky to be able to tell about it. That&rsquo;s when I was young, poor, and lived near blacks. I was liberal, tolerant, and knew nothing about them, and had to learn the hard way.  But above all, I was just plain lucky.<br/>

If I may say, without bragging, I am (or was then) also quick witted, quick tongued, and quick footed   &mdash;    each of which has saved me on various occasions. But above all, it was sheer luck.  That was when I lived near blacks.  I don&rsquo;t live them near them anymore. I&rsquo;m older now and don&rsquo;t move or run so fast. I couldn&rsquo;t handle it today. Distance is the best protection. That, plus a gun and a big dog.</p>

&#8220;And I have never carried a firearm&hellip;&#8221;-Peejay<br/>
Well why not Peejay?!? Your locale? Your parental upbringing?!?<br/>
I had parents that forbade any type of gun. It was not in my universe. Had to learn all about them on my own. Luckily I had   books and a good teacher. The German Army&hellip; Now I have a carry permit. And more importantly, I have realized that I will never again let fear of arrest keep from from being armed, if that`s what I think the situation calls for.<br/>
  &#8220;Motivates me to keep loaded guns where I can reach them in a heartbeat&#8221;-Periapsis  Peejay are you listening?&hellip; This is the attitude you must have if you want to have a chance of survival. Getting to here from where you are now, will take change. After it happens you will wonder about the person you used to be. And why you were afraid or hesitant to make the transition.<br/>
  Finally on various posters comments on keeping potential harm at arms length. Good basic advice. A lot easier to accomplish with one hand resting on the butt of a gun. In my growth stages of becoming an old crumudgeon, I went through three stages. First learning how to NOT answer the phone. Then learning how NOT to answer the door. Finally, learning how NOT to respond or slow down on the street to an interloper who accosts me. I still wonder why the avoidance of the most danger (Outside in person) took me the longest to master&hellip;.<br/>
   And to end it all. My family has recently begun making noises about gun control and all the wacko`s out there like me who feel the &#8220;paranoid&#8221; need to carry a gun. I ask them if having a fire extinguisher in the kitchen is &#8220;paranoid&#8221; or just common safety sense. Same with fix-a-flat in the trunk driving thru the desert. What`s the difference I ask to a sullen silent audience&hellip;</p>

<p>Being aware of black predators can be helpful but not if you are the only prey around and they are stalking you.  I was mugged once, did everything I could to throw them off.  Finally I threw my purse at the one in back ( they did a classic box) just as he was starting his dash.  He picked up the purse and the 2 of them ran to the 3rd who was driving the car.  They stalked me for about 2 blocks.  During that time I removed my wallet with money, credit cards etc from the purse and put them in my raincoat pocket.  Lucky it was winter.</p>
<p>Luckily it was a small purse, not a big one filled with checkbooks, address book blackberry etc.</p>
<p>They got not one cent of cash and nothing but some cheap 99c store hairbrushes, pens and lipstick.</p>
<p>I urge all women to forego the convenience of carrying around a portable office in a big purse and just take what you need for the current day.  Buying clothes with pockets is another good idea.  The best security pockets are those left inside pockets in men&rsquo;s jackets and coats.  A small moneybelt that fits under clothes invisibily is a good investment.  Another good idea is to carry a plastic grocery bag in a small or medium sized purse.  After dark if there is a black neighborhood within 20 miles simply put the purse in the grocery bag.  If they don&rsquo;t see the purse they can&rsquo;t try to steal it.</p>
<p>Most of all, regard all black males after dark as potential muggers and rapists.  Groups of 3 in a car are almost always predators looking to rob, murder and rape Whites.</p>
<p>If you are not going to buy anything, leave credit, debit, ATM cards and checkbook at home.  It&rsquo;s safer to keep a blackberry and date book at home, in the car or at work. </p>

		<p>Murder in one of the most liberal neighborhoods in Baltimore: right off the Johns Hopkins campus.  Largely white/Asian student and prof population. The criminals correctly smelled blood and no resistance-they wouldn&rsquo;t have pulled this across the county line in north Baltimore County. I&rsquo;m sure someone, the cops, the media, someone, has tried to tell these two losers who have been sprung on parole after countless serious felonies, that the person they killed could have done great things for humanity, even blacks. These crack addicts wit no consciences or brains could care less. </p>
<p>In Governor O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s Maryland, they will happily spend a few years in our state pen, copping more crack, which is the definition of their existence. In O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s Maryland, the death penalty is verboten and the Catholic Church makes sure the thousands of thugs and killers who roam Maryland&rsquo;s numerous black and Hispanic neighborhoods are never ever executed.</p>

		<p>Posters here are &#8220;Killing me softly with their songs&#8221; on this topic. Especially #33 about being quick witted, quick tongued and quick footed  which just about describes me also. To the lady poster who described her mugging. Thank you. In my own case it was more locale than anything that got me ensnared. I was alone on foot in a warehouse district. When the two thugs pulled up to accost me, I ran! But there was nowhere to go. Just chain link fence for a half mile down the road on each side of the street. All they did was drive along next to me until I keeled over and held up the wallet. <br/>
  I now have a sixth sense about what I have termed &#8220;corridors of fear&#8221;. Hokey but it works for me. Any path that brings me into contact with others in numbers or limits evasion options. Anyway I like everyones story. I`d rather learn from others experiences. Hope they might learn from mine too.</p>

		<p>A lot of people in the rest of the country are unaware that you do not have to list your address or telephone number on your checks.  Stores will accept your first two initials and your last name.</p>
<p>Also, you can list a PO Box on your drivers license.  I would never have any mail come to my residence.  Most vendors are perfectly fine with the idea that people have a billing address and a delivery address.  In many cases, most employers don&rsquo;t have a problem if you receive packages at work.</p>
<p>I am pro-gun and pro-carry.  However, when Texas allowed concealed weapons after the Luby Cafeteria Massacre near Killeen in Bell County, every store and public place posted signs that weapons weren&rsquo;t allowed on the premises and they would prosecute anyone who brought them in, effectively voiding the CCW Act for the law-abiding.</p>
<p>Hurricane Katrina proved that our government will seize on any excuse to disarm the citizenry when the first thing they did was swoop down on White neighborhoods and take their guns from them even though it was obvious they weren&rsquo;t holed up in their homes, trying to defend their lives and properties from the obvious threats, not out there robbing, raping, killing and looting.</p>
<p>Another big problem is that people can get too complacent where possession of a gun is concerned.  There are situations where you may not be able to get to one fast enough and then a quick-witted, nimble, stronger assailant can disarm the gun owner and turn it on them.</p>
<p>I would like to see any and all threads where people have knowledge of any self-defense courses.  I&rsquo;m not talking about any stylistic, mega-expensive oriental stuff that takes years to learn and silly costume to buy.  I&rsquo;m talking about serious, down and dirty street combat tactics.  </p>
<p>IMO, guns are useful, but they aren&rsquo;t the only solution.  At best, they are a backup solution.  Whites need to have something in the place of guns when they are not in our hands.  We all have to put them down at sometime another.  </p>

		<p>We should keep some perspective.  The crime rate has been going down since 1980.  According to the FBI&rsquo;s Uniform Crime Report, in 1980, there were 5,950 crimes per 100,000 inhabitants. By 2006 that declined to 3,808. <br/>
<a href="http://www.delmar.edu/socsci/rlong/data/CrimeData/History-rates.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.delmar.edu/socsci/rlong/data/CrimeData/History-rates.htm</a><br/>
  <br/>
Crime has continued to decline, although I do not have more recent data.  <br/>
 <br/>
The reason for the decline is not that we have been getting to the root cause of crime, by reducing poverty, and all that liberal nonsense. The reason is that from 1980 to 2000 the prison population increased from 315,974 to 1,428,187.<br/>
<a href="../../../../issues/lawenforcement/punishment.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.jacksonprogressive.com/issues/lawenforcement/punishment.pdf</a><br/>
 <br/>
Punishment works.  In addition, Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt have argued in their book Freakonomics that since the Roe v. Wade decision, abortion has disproportionately destroyed fetuses that would have grown to be violent street criminals.  <br/>
 <br/>
Females who are most likely to have abortions are most likely to be young, poor, poorly educated, and unmarried.  By interesting coincidence, they are also most likely to give birth to thugs like the two who killed  Stephen Pitcairn.   </p>

		<p>Stephen Pitcairn was killed by a knife.  Pepper foam has more range than a knife, and there are fewer legal restrictions on it than on hand guns.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have used pepper foam to thwart three mugging efforts. When one is in a dangerous area one should carry it in one&rsquo;s hand, while avoiding the approach of young black men.  Every now and then look behind you to see if anyone is following.  A mugger will frequently come up from you from behind, push you to the ground, and start hitting you in the face, yelling, &#8220;Where&rsquo;s the money?&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
I have no objection to carrying a hand gun if you can get a permit, but in many locations you can&rsquo;t.  Also, just because someone seems threatening does not mean that you have the legal right to shoot him.  I would rather spray someone who is dangerous looking but harmless, than kill him.<br/>
 <br/>
Just because you see a large young black man with an angry scowl on his face does not mean he will rob you.  He might be angry because he was robbed two weeks ago, or because one of his friends was recently murdered.  Blacks are much more likely to be crime victims than whites.<br/>

<p>John,<br/>
Even better than pepper foam is Wasp/Hornet Killer. It has a very long range. I&rsquo;ve seen it go past 10 feet. It has a strong stream that minimizes blowback if you&rsquo;re shooting into the wind. If directed at the attacker&rsquo;s face it will blind him temporarily or permanently depending on the duration of the stream and really who cares? If the intended victim is real lucky and gets him in the mouth, it could be fatal.</p>

<p>The best weapon any of us could have would be if ALL of us armed and ready to fight to defend our lives, what&rsquo;s ours, our loved ones and our way of life  &mdash;   men and women and children that are old enough.  </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The pack so to speak  &mdash;  now subsidizes and protects those who publicly harass and denigrate with our women, browbeat and bully our children, and pair up to pick us off, in the dank of some dark alley, when walking alone&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>What if those in the pack knew that we are armed, ready and prepared to defend ourselves against them with deadly force?  Would they be willing to risk their lives to rape, browbeat and bully us?  They will learn quickly that if they do, they will pay with their lives.</p>
<p>Teach your females, your elderly and children who are old enough how to use a gun or sign them up for firearms training at the local gun range  &mdash;   this is from &#8220;How to Prepare for the Coming Riots&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Remington makes a highly chic equalizer for women, Model 870 in pink.</p>
<p>Gun controls are a deceitful way to make women helpless, so that they feel weak unless they have a man to defend them. It keeps them psychologically subordinate, and desirous of a powerful Big Brother government for protection.</p>
<p>If a woman&rsquo;s liberation does not begin with her Second Amendment rights, then it cannot exist. There&rsquo;s nothing more basic than the right of self defense&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>Now Do It.</p>

		<p>Where are the great leaders of social justice REV Al and REV Jessie? Why aren&rsquo;t they standing up for the for people being mistreated by racist? Oh I forgot, a white person is held to a  different standard to these bums</p>

		<p>I had the rare opportunity to be riding the Amtrak train past Baltimore this past weekend. The areas visible near the train track are all in various states of decay, some very advanced. They tend to be row houses. Some are standing alone, the last one remaining in what was once an entire block of interesting 19th century structures. Any person visible in the streets was black. I don&rsquo;t know if the structures are rented, or owned. </p>
<p>Anyway, here is an idea. Whites should purchase as much property in such neighborhoods, and then demolish the structures. Just tear them down, these buildings time are over. Our ancestors did too good a job in building them. Just rip it all down. And no selling to developers for &#8220;urban renewal&#8221;. Own the land and chase out the inhabitants.  Expel them. Let them yell racism, who cares. Own the land, and chase them out and let them go back to where it is they came from. This is the only way to protect our cities, and ourselves and our descendants. If enough whites got together, we could do this. It wouldn&rsquo;t take many of us to purchase large swatches of land, as real estate in run-down urban areas can be very cheap, even back at the height of the real estate bubble. </p>

		<p>To my post I forgot to add:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why the properties in just about any run-down,usually all-black, urban area aren&rsquo;t owned and fixed up by blacks. This is, after all, their neighborhood. Prices usually are often ridiculously low, some go for 10,000 per property.The mortgage would be something like $50 to $100 dollars per month for such a fixer-upper. True, they need much repair. Aren&rsquo;t there black plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and others in the home repair trade that could do this work for their fellow man? </p>

		<p>Patricia Jessamy&rsquo;s office (City State&rsquo;s Attorney) does not ask for death penalties. They do in Baltimore County, but not Baltimore City. My husband, when he was a long-time Baltimore City resident, always got jury duty, but was always preemptively challenged because he is a p.o&rsquo;d looking white guy who stands at parade rest. <br/>
Baltimore juries don&rsquo;t convict Baltimore criminals, especially ones who kill white people&hellip;that is the impression.</p>
