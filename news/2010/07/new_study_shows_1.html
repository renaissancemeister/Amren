			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Glen Ford, Black Agenda Report, July 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The latest study was conducted for the University of California system, and replicates most of the results of the 2003 study. Researchers concluded that Black students did worse than whites on easier questions with more common words because some of those words have different connotations in Black and white cultural settings. For example, simple words like &#8220;bad,&#8221; &#8220;tight&#8221; and &#8220;slick&#8221; carry different meanings in colloquial Black speech than in white usage. The SATs test the &#8220;white&#8221; meanings, putting Blacks at a disadvantage for the easy questions. In the smaller number of hard questions involving words that are not normally used in everyday, household speech, Blacks score higher than whites, because these learned words don&rsquo;t have multiple or culture-based meanings. Apparently, Blacks did better at learning the uncommon vocabulary than whites. However, whites do so much better than Blacks on the easier questions, white overall SAT scores are much higher.</p>
<p>The research measured the performance of Black and white students who were matched &#8220;by proficiency&#8221;  &mdash;  that is, based on their educational backgrounds and skills, the Blacks and whites should do about the same on the SATs. There was no indication that the test was biased against Latinos. But one of the researchers for the first, 2003 study found that some of the Black students would have scored about 100 points higher on the SAT if there had been more hard questions on the test.</p>
<p>Critics of the SAT and other &#8220;high stakes&#8221; tests have called the new research a &#8220;bombshell&#8221; that should move more institutions to drop SATs entirely. {snip} The Board withheld data from the racial bias researchers for two years, and continues to claim the studies produced &#8220;inconsistent findings.&#8221; The Board blames racial discrepancies in testing on &#8220;educational inequities&#8221; in the United States, but claims the tests are fair.</p>
<p>The truth is, there is both vast &#8220;educational inequity&#8221; in the U.S. and built-in cultural/racial biases in the tests, themselves. High stakes testing is embedded in the institutionally racist walls that were massively erected in the wake of nominal integration of education, in order to preserve white privilege. {snip}<br>

		<p>More nonsense presented as a scientific study.</p>
<p>Words have English definitions, not white definitions.</p>
<p>And whites and blacks should be equally aware that the words &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; &ldquo;tight&rdquo; and &ldquo;slick&rdquo; carry different meanings when used as slang.  That is elementary.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Standardized testing is now used as a weapon to set public education up for failure, as an institution, so that it can be privatized and remain racially exclusive.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Then why don&rsquo;t blacks set up private schools like whites do? Because they don&rsquo;t care about education as much as they do about bitching and blaming someone else for their poor performance. Besides that, it would take initiative on the part of blacks and using their own money. And they have a cultural bias about paying for anything themselves.</p>

		<p>The study says blacks are SLIGHTLY better than MATCHED ABILITY whites at the SAT section that is judged by those issuing the study to contain &#8220;Hard Words&#8221;.</p>
<p>MATCHED ABILITY is the key.</p>
<p>Because the theory of white privilege dictates that whites are placed in programs above their ability, and blacks below - the above average whites were competing against below average whites - according to the dogma of white privilege - and thus MATCHED ABILITY becomes a bit of a misnomer - as above average IQ blacks were competing against whites that much have been borderline retarded.</p>
<p>Remember the recent article about some NJ schools considering doing away with their AP programs because there were not enough or no blacks at all in them?  Well I have news for you - NO BLACKS are being compared against these whites in these AP classes because they are not considered MATCHED ABILITY.</p>
<p>So we are to believe that blacks are scoring 100 points below whites of MATCHED ABILITY because of ebonics?  Is that abomination rearing its ugly head again?</p>
<p>Also notice the study doesn&rsquo;t touch Math scores on the SAT with a 10 foot pole - wonder why?  2 + x = 4 - that&rsquo;s racist because when blacks see X they think of Malcom X, and two Malcom X&rsquo;s = one Martin Luther King - but because it&rsquo;s a multiple choice question the blacks rip up the paper and run out of the room screaming&hellip;.  Is that going to be their excuse?</p>
<p>These &#8220;studies&#8221; are 100% designed to excuse the failures of black students, and degrade the achievement of white students - nothing more.  As most studies that are abusing the statistics read between the lines - MATCHED ABILITY is the key word here.  </p>

		<p>So blacks are better at larnin them thar big wurds? Who&rsquo;d a thunk it? I&rsquo;m glad us whites are better at the easy questions, otherwise we&rsquo;d no nuttin whatsonever. So, who carried out this &#8220;study&#8221; and where did the money for this come from? So, let me get this straight, if we increase the number of &#8220;hard questions&#8221; on a test then blacks will really score well, leaving us mere whites way behind? No more dumbing down but rather smartening up tests will promote more blacks? Sheesh, only an edumacated person could be that dumb.  </p>

<p>Oh c&rsquo;mon!  What do they take us for?  Have you ever heard the typical Black person&rsquo;s vocabulary?  &#8220;Sh** this&#8221;! and &#8220;F*** that&#8221;!<br>
This is just an inversion of reality.  It would not surprise me if this so-called &#8220;study&#8221; was tainted from the outset.  It is as plain as day that the Intelligence Quotient of Blacks is far lower than that of Whites.  This is nothing more than an attempt at &#8220;uplifting&#8221; Blacks in our eyes; make us think that we are actually not as smart as Blacks.  It&rsquo;s a further attempt at &#8220;dumbing down&#8221; Whites, which they&rsquo;re well on the road of doing right now, dragging us down to the level of the Black.  There&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind that the media, and the academic institutions have engaged in and are engaging in right now, a systematic conditioning of White people&rsquo;s collective perception of themselves.  The conditioning is for destruction.  It&rsquo;s a fact that people - even intelligent people - can be conditioned to believe that they&rsquo;re inferior.  The dumbing down of Whites is proof positive of that.  We must not let academia do this, to either ourselves or our children.  We must communicate the situation to our children so that they aren&rsquo;t affected by this propaganda.<br>

		<p>This guy&rsquo;s statements are as nonsense as the blacks had their knowledge and civilization stolen from them by whites.  If they are sooo smart, they should not to take welfare, affirmative action, etc. from whites.  They should be like the Asians standing on their own two feet.  If the whites say no more, what are they going to do?  Perhaps, they might try harder to help themselves!</p>

They&rsquo;re still focused on the vocabulary section I see. They&rsquo;re not claiming the math section is biased.</p>
<p>While words have definitive meanings, there&rsquo;s some shades of gray along the way. Regional, ethnic, and racial variations pop up but familiarity with standard English should trump those differences.</p>
<p>Would a separate black SAT help? It&rsquo;s not very likely as black English changes day to day and being hip and cool, blacks love to attach new meanings to words on a whim.  </p>
<p><i>&#8220;But one of the researchers for the first, 2003 study found that some of the Black students would have scored about 100 points higher on the SAT if there had been more hard questions on the test.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Making the SATs harder will ensure more blacks get higher scores. OK, let&rsquo;s run that experiment and see the results.</p>

		<p>What a joke. &#8220;Bad&#8221; is not a vocabulary word tested on the SAT! What are the &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; definitions for supercilious, fractious, superfluous, and other sorts of words that the SAT really does test?</p>
<p>I used to live in a majority black neighborhood. Most of the black adults and teens I ran into had the vocabulary of an average white 8 year old (or less). Yet, somehow, I&rsquo;m supposed to believe that they actually have bigger vocabularies than whites their own age? Another case of blacks screaming, &#8220;Believe me and not your lying eyes.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Clearly, this &#8220;study&#8221; was done to &#8220;conclude&#8221; that the remedy is to DROP ALL SAT TESTING.  He couched that recommendation in twisted logic that would SEEM to imply that blacks are inherently smarter, but are held by by confusing language using simpler words.  Right.  We know that&rsquo;s just not true.  When WE use a word in conversation with blacks we consider normal, they either look at us with a zombie blank look, or they misinterpret it and agree or become insulted simply because they don&rsquo;t know what the heck it means.  Bottom line, this was just another huckster giving another bogus reason to drop SAT testing for college.  Why?  Because in spite of manure he is shoveling here, blacks have lower IQ&rsquo;s, less understanding of complex reasoning, a far smaller vocabulary, and almost NO comprehension of math.  Notice he did NOT mention MATH?  Of course blacks want to see SAT&rsquo;s dropped.  For whatever reason they can conjure up.</p>

<p>Is that something like the bias against me because I didn&rsquo;t know the answers to the questions asked on tests when I was a boy in school? If they&rsquo;d only asked the questions I knew the answers to, I&rsquo;d have done extremely well. But then again, it would have been a very, very short test.</p>

		<p>This is just another in a flood of studies that is specifically aimed at tearing down White accomplishments in our society.  The implicit assumption of the researchers is that Blacks and Whites are equal in mental abilities, and that therefore any discrepancy in test results must be explainable by bias.  By torturing the data long enough, they produce the anti-White conclusion they so desperately desire.  </p>
<p>The articles announcing the study results have two messages to pound into the complacent minds of Whites:</p>
<p>1) Blacks are better than Whites at hard questions</p>
<p>2) Whites unfairly depress Black scores by using simple words in a context that Blacks might misinterpret.</p>
<p>Read the article again.  It&rsquo;s not telling you that Blacks are equal to Whites, it&rsquo;s telling you that Whites are INFERIOR and thus implying that the test should be modified until the proper results are obtained.</p>
<p>Always remember that the media and the researchers continually throw this type of study in your face because they have a social agenda that they wish to advance.  They are trying to manipulate your perception of yourselves, your nation, your people, and your accomplishments.</p>
<p>They do this by endlessly lauding the accomplishments of minorities and denigrating the accomplishments of Whites.  This behavior is practiced in every aspect of American society by the leaders and opinion shapers in media, government, religious, business, and academic circles.  </p>
<p>The process apparently works very effectively, for it has clearly caused many Whites to devalue the accomplishments and capabilities of their own people.  Not too long back for example there was an interesting series of articles in the UK papers that triumphantly crowed the message that Asian / Indian students routinely outperformed White students in British schools.  In the comments to those articles, British Whites happily accepted the idea that their own people could not perform.  This, from the people that produced NEWTON, Faraday, Raleigh, and thousands of other giants of human intellectual attainment?</p>
<p>Clearly the notion that White Britons are not some of the world&rsquo;s best and brightest is absolute RUBBISH, yet with proper media conditioning a large number of modern Brits were easily convinced to accept the notion as true.  Even worse, when that notion is continually reinforced to White children, it will have a corrosive effect on their confidence and performance.</p>
<p>Be alert to this type of anti-White bias, and when you see it, CHALLENGE it.  If you don&rsquo;t, it will provide another weapon to those who wish to destroy you and everything you hold dear.</p>

		<p>This is the Truth:</p>
<p>I have taught English composition (K-12 and college &amp; university) for 20 years. I have never  &mdash;  not once  &mdash;  had the privilege of teaching a competent black, male or female. The English language contains more than a million words. It is elastic and incessantly changing. African languages are not as complex. </p>
<p>The sad yet inescapable Truth: Africans don&rsquo;t have the intellectual ability to master English. </p>
<p>Ebonics is an excuse for blacks&rsquo; sloth and sloppiness and their psychological inability to master the very complex English language. </p>

		<p>What the &#8216;study&rsquo; seems to be screaming to me is that blacks are bad with &#8216;Context&rsquo;, while whites, even &#8216;evenly matched&rsquo; whites, are good with the contextual dimension of language.</p>
<p>The recent crisis resulting from blacks&rsquo; confusing &#8216;Black Holes&rsquo; with &#8216;black hos&rsquo; on a talking greeting card confirms the &#8216;context&rsquo; thing for me.  Not only is there the context of comparing graduates with phenomena of Outer Space, but there is also the context that includes the fact that the card is from Hallmark.  HALLMARK!  Sugar-sweet, wholesome-central, feel-good 24/7 Hallmark!  I mean, it&rsquo;s not as if Hallmark has a history of hurling racist/sexist insults (or coarse language&hellip;) at its readership (well&hellip;I guess NOW they do&hellip;).</p>
<p>And I think of the episode of South Park, where they visit Planet Marglar.  It&rsquo;s a place where there&rsquo;s only one noun: Marglar.  Still, from context, it&rsquo;s astonishingly easy to tell what they&rsquo;re referring to: even in sentences where there are several &#8216;Marglars&rsquo;.  At least it&rsquo;s easy for whites.  I wonder what &#8216;evenly matched&rsquo; blacks made of those conversations.</p>

<p><br>
<i>Critics of the SAT and other &ldquo;high stakes&rdquo; tests have called the new research a &ldquo;bombshell&rdquo; that should move more institutions to drop SATs entirely.</i></p>
<p><br>
Note that use of the word &#8220;should.&#8221; That alone tells you this article is not objective reporting, but what is called &#8220;advocacy journalism&#8221;, i.e. the kind that&rsquo;s out to convince you of something; and/or to influence public policy. </p>
<p>Beyond that, the article&rsquo;s claims about blacks being better at &#8220;harder&#8221; words than whites   &mdash;   claims we first read about on AR a couple of weeks ago in an earlier (but equally nonsensical) news item   &mdash;   flies in the face of common sense. A group of people who have trouble pronouncing the three-letter word &#8220;ask&#8221; are better at long, multisyllabic words than whites? </p>

		<p>&#8220;Researchers concluded that Black students did worse than whites on easier questions with more common words because some of those words have different connotations in Black and white cultural settings. For example, simple words like &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; &ldquo;tight&rdquo; and &ldquo;slick&rdquo; carry different meanings in colloquial Black speech than in white usage. The SATs test the &ldquo;white&rdquo; meanings, putting Blacks at a disadvantage for the easy questions. In the smaller number of hard questions involving words that are not normally used in everyday, household speech, Blacks score higher than whites, because these learned words don&rsquo;t have multiple or culture-based meanings. Apparently, Blacks did better at learning the uncommon vocabulary than whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>What utter nonsense.  We are to believe that people who know the meaning of a word like &#8220;malevolent&#8221; don&rsquo;t know what the word &#8220;bad&#8221; means in the context of an SAT test?  As if anyone who was smart would think that the SAT tests one on ghetto vocabulary.  And what do they mean in saying that difficult words have no &#8220;culture-based meaning&#8221;?  &#8220;Latinate&#8221; - there&rsquo;s a &#8220;difficult&#8221; word, and it&rsquo;s meaning is certainly rooted in some particular culture.</p>
<p>There seems to be no length that academics will not go to, in order to explain away the obvious and persistent difference in mean intelligence between whites and blacks.</p>

		<p>Steven Sailers explanation for this discrepancy might very well be accurate. Sailers explanation is that when the questions on a multiple choice question get more difficult, more of the test takers are guessing, up to a point where everyone would be guessing (and have a 25% chance of getting the question right). So, on the tougher portions of the test, those who do poorly would be doing just as well as those with a high score.</p>
<p>If so, the question remains, did the researchers themselves understand this and so construct the experiment, or report on this &#8216;evidence&rsquo; knowing full well there was nothing really to it&hellip; it could just be made to Look as if there was something there?</p>
<p>What about the journalists reporting the &#8216;bias&rsquo;? Notice how in the article here&hellip; &#8216;blacks doing better on the more difficult portions of the test&hellip; has been turned into &#8216;blacks do better than other racial groups on the difficult portions of the test&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there an over-site body that can look into this &#8216;fraud&rsquo; and punish the responsible parties? Unless of course, this is now considered the epitome of higher learning. </p>
<p>If it was some kind of right-leaning conclusion the researchers would just be labeled &#8216;racist&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;SAT prep companies publish vocabulary lists for $30 which consistently appear on the exam. After memorizing Baron&rsquo;s 3,500 word list and taking the SAT in 2001, I noticed only about a dozen words were not included in the list.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did the same thing and I received a near perfect score on the verbal section.  If someone goes through the list of commonly used words on these tests, he or she should be able to get nearly everything right (unless one&rsquo;s memory is poor). <br>

		<p>Notice the article didn&rsquo;t recommend removing words that &#8220;have different connotations in Black and white cultural settings.&#8221; No, they wanted to abandon the tests altogether. That should be the first clue that their intentions were dishonest. And it is also an indication that even they know those tests are a fair representation of ability.</p>

		<p>&#8220;New Study Shows Racial Bias in SATs, Black Agenda Report.&#8221;</p>
<p>If blacks aren&rsquo;t busy trying to distort history and revise it to to try to flim flam people into believing it was blacks and not Cacasoids or another race of people who achieved greatness or accomplished great things&hellip;..like the ancient Egyptians were black as was one third of the Roman senate&hellip;&hellip;then they are busy fabricating and exaggerating facts about black intelligence, like the above story, or their claims that black intelligence is the same as whites, but it isn&rsquo;t reflected academically or on tests, or real life experiences, because of racism and oppression, which occurred so long ago it couldn&rsquo;t possibly be a factor.  </p>
<p>Actually, since poor immigrants who arrive on this shore who can&rsquo;t even speak English, yet excel over blacks in every way, makes a mockery of black claims for any period in their history responsible for holding them back, as does the fact that blacks the world over do just as badly as blacks here, yet their ancestors have never been subjected to slavery.<br>
 <br>
Of course the reason for all of these black lies is because blacks have led a stone-age existence for 5000 years and accomplished no more than what would be expected of those in the hunter/gatherer stage of human evolution, and they&rsquo;re hysterical in their frantic attempts to find something to brag about, regarding their race besides being able to jump and run.</p>
<p>Most all black leaders are so embarassed by black low intelligence, lack of ability, and their current obvious failures throughout the world today, they&rsquo;ll go to any lengths to try to upgrade the black image no matter how masny outrageous lies they have to tell.  But most of what they claim is so unintelligent they end up revealing even more of their inabilities by the childish claims they make which are so rife with nonsense anyone with average intelligence can easily see the disingenuousness of it all.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE:  That the Tea Party crowd uttered the &#8220;N&#8221; word 15 times and spit on a black was disproven time and time again, yet the NAACP is carrying on with the charges in spite of video and witness evidence to the contrary.  They&rsquo;ve not only made fools of themselves for attempting such an obviously unintelligent ploy, the&rsquo;ve revealed themselves as no more than liars, making themselves once more the laughing stock of the nation.</p>
<p>Or, how about the black Congressman who warned against putting too many people on one side of an island, because it would tip over like a boat?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enough stories and examples to fill a very large book, so when I read stories like the above I hit the highlights only, because I know it is going to amount to no more than more unintelligent black drivel filled with lies and exaggerations, with a decided undertone of hate for whitey.</p>
<p>Our only chance to continue to excel as a people is to somehow get away from these miscreants and let them burden someone else with their imbecility or leave them to destroy themselves like so many black run countries, states and cities in the world have done and are doing today.</p>
<p>And, incidentally, separation is proving to be a very real possibility with this ongoing depression that shows every promise of causing a PERMANENT racial divide in this country when all is said and done.  Thank you community organizer and NAACP for your help.  We owe you.</p>

		<p>The cry of racisim is getting so old it&rsquo;s like we are in the 1692 Salem witch trials. Lets look at the real reason for failure. Did they study for the test? Where they decent students?<br>
The test is not racist to Whites and Asians&hellip;gee I wonder why?</p>

<p>When I went to school in a foreign language, my grades were considerably lower than they were when I went to school in my own language. My parents NEVER whined about &#8220;cultural bias&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I would really like if the study said EXACTLY how much better the blacks did, because I am not buying this at all.  Say there are 100 &#8220;hard&#8221; questions, and blacks get 3 more right that white OF MATCHED ABILITY, that does not mean they know more hard words.  </p>
<p>The truth is that MOST SAT test-takers are almost purely guessing on the really hard questions.  And, if we&rsquo;re talking about &#8220;matched ability&#8221; between whites and blacks, I am going to assume that these test-takers are of a slightly below average IQ.  That means that all of them are essentially guessing.  </p>
<p>Re-do this study where all the test-takers have to EXPLAIN why they chose a certain answer.  The results?  The brightest and most studious kids will be able to explain why they picked the answer, the average kids may be able to tell you why they eliminated one or two answers and guessed the right one, and the rest all randomly selected an answer that turned out to be right, but actually have absolutely no idea what any of the words mean.  </p>

		<p>Philadelphia, July 27</p>
<p>A 16 year old African- American boy is in stable condition in a Philadelphia hospital after being was attacked by a gang of 12 violin and woodwind students from the Philadelphia College of the Arts.<br>
The victim DeShawn Maleek Shamir Sparks was standing on the corner of Broad &amp; Walnut Streets listening to Mahler&rsquo;s 3rd Symphony when the gang approached him and challenged his right to listen to classical music on his Boombox. The assailants told him that it was an insult to White people. When Sparks, in an attempt to placate the gang, told them that he also listened to Wagner&rsquo;s Overture to Lohengrin on the same box they challenged him to tell them what number Lohengrin was on the Kirchel listing. When Sparks didn&rsquo;t respond the racist, musical thugs began to beat him about the head and shoulders with their violin bow and stick him in the buttocks with reeds from their clarinets.<br>
Police arrived in time to arrest the thugs.<br>
Sparks, the father of three girls and a boy according to his mother Laqueesha Sha&rsquo;eeka Stokes was &#8220;tryin to toyn his life around&#8221;. She stated that he is a fine young man who loves his children but lately became involved with classical music which led him astray. <br>
Sparks is expected to make a full recovery and the vicious, racist WHITE thugs who attacked him will be charged with Hate Crimes.</p>
