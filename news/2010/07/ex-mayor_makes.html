<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38393559/ns/politics/">Ex-Mayor Makes Memphis Primary About Race</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adrian Sainz, MSNBC, July 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the city where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, a once-unbeatable former mayor wants the Democratic congressional primary to be a referendum on race.</p>
<p>Willie Herenton is accusing white two-term incumbent U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen of &#8220;trying to act black.&#8221; He tells voters in this majority-black city that they &#8220;need to come off that Cohen plantation and get on the Herenton freedom train.&#8221;</p>
<p>But President Barack Obama has endorsed Cohen, who has an &#8220;A&#8221; rating from the NAACP and has built support in the black community by supporting civil rights legislation and bringing much-needed federal funding to Memphis schools and hospitals.</p>
<p>{snip} [Cohen said,] &#8220;President Obama&rsquo;s election proves that voters don&rsquo;t look at race when making a decision in an election.&#8221;</p>
<p>Herenton is betting they will. Though in interviews he&rsquo;s happy to address issues like improving public schools, creating jobs and bolstering small minority businesses, on the campaign trail he focuses mostly on race and his contention that Tennessee needs &#8220;just one&#8221; black representative in its all-white congressional delegation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 200 people recently attended a barbecue at Herenton campaign headquarters, and his strategy is resonating with some black voters.</p>
<p>Antonio Parkinson, president of the community group Voices of Raleigh/Frayser, hasn&rsquo;t decided whom to vote for in the Aug. 5 primary, though he said Herenton&rsquo;s argument about diversifying the delegation is valid.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Politically powerful black ministers in Memphis have stayed mum, showing a reluctance to publicly support Herenton.</p>
<p><b>Campaigns take off</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Congress, he has sponsored or supported legislation addressing racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice system and apologizing for slavery and Jim Crow segregation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Until Cohen took office, the district belonged to the Ford political machine. Harold Ford Sr., who has endorsed Cohen, was elected the state&rsquo;s first black congressman in 1974. Harold Ford Jr. replaced his dad in 1996, then gave up the seat to make an unsuccessful bid for Senate a decade later.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Herenton, who is respected for improving the city&rsquo;s economy, luring corporate investment and helping revitalize downtown, has never lost an election. He spent 18 years as mayor and 12 years before that as superintendent of schools.</p>
<p>He resigned last year amid a federal corruption investigation into whether he used his city office to help his private real estate deals, but the probe has gone dormant and likely is over after last month&rsquo;s Supreme Court ruling on corruption laws.</p>

		<p>Next, renewed calls from the blacks to dig up the sacred bones of White General Nathan Bedford Forrest so he can be thrown in the garbage.</p>
<p>We like black hatemongering, because it makes our greatest enemies,  the White Liberal Elites, look more and more idiotic and dangerous.</p>

		<p>I think the media is playing this up. Sure, blacks are very racist, much more so than white folks, but blacks are going to vote for the Democratic candidate, not the black candidate.</p>

		<p>Around here in Memphis, most Whites think that Herenton is literally mentally ill, the way he acts, which includes challenging people to fistfights, and engaging in a tragi-comic boxing match with the washed-up and seriously-impaired Joe Frazier. </p>
<p>Many Blacks do, too. But not enough to have kept him from being Mayor of Memphis for almost twenty years. </p>
<p>You know the story  &mdash;  black candidate receives 96% of black vote.<br>
And Memphis has a lot of black votes.</p>
<p>A part of the &#8220;Re-Africanization of America&#8221; I seriously suppose. </p>
<p>But do I want Cohen to win? I don&rsquo;t think so; he is the more effective person, and I don&rsquo;t want the Democrats to be more effective than they have disastrously been.</p>
<p>Herenton as a congressman would be just one more proof of the &#8220;African Supreme King&#8221; mentality of blacks.</p>
<p>Why, he might even challenge Obama to a fistfight!</p>
<p>That would be priceless!</p>

		<p>Hmmmm&hellip;I wonder if Obama really has begun to worry about the white vote in 2012.  The White House claims he won&rsquo;t campaign for FL Senatorial black candidate Kendrick Meek because Obama&rsquo;s support might hurt Meek among whites!  In the primary, Meek is up against some oddball whom he&rsquo;s bound to beat.  I overheard one of the MSNBC ding-dongs talking like he would rather see the white oddball win so that black Democrat support would then shift to independent Crist, the purportedly in-the-closet Republican guv who once hugged Barack and is no doubt the darling of the far left.  </p>

		<p>The only thing new about all this is that a black candidate is making explicit what has been implicit all along   &mdash;   that blacks vote for blacks because they&rsquo;re black.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think we need to see more of this sort of thing to shock White voters out of their horror of voting for their own.  And I have no doubt that we will.<br>

		<p>Of COURSE it&rsquo;s about race!!!  BO has been without doubt the most polarizing president since Lincoln.  Anyone with an ounce of black blood will vote for the black candidate.  However, I think the dark horse (so to speak) is the Hispanic vote.  Out here in SoCA, the Hispanics do NOT like the blacks, and most would probably set fire to a blankie impressed with the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe before they&rsquo;d vote for a black.  Most whites would choose a white candidate - not all but most.  And, I know a lot of whites who voted for Obama would never do it again.  So we shall see how truly the racial tendencies for voting hold&hellip;</p>

<p>Of course, it shows exactly the opposite. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;He [Willie Herenton] resigned last year amid a federal corruption investigation&hellip;<br>
 <br>
That, to a lot of voters, is another plus. He&rsquo;s been targeted by the white man&rsquo;s system. </p>

		<p>cohen has played the race card his whole career, he is the most anti-white white there ever was&hellip;i hope herenton not only plays the race card against cohen, but breats him in the election. i am sending money to herenton to help. i would rather support an anti-white, black racist than a anti-white, white racist. the liberal anti-white, white politicians have done more damage to white america than any of the blacks have ever done. google cohen and you will see what i am talking about.</p>

		<p>Willie Herenton improved the Memphis economy   &mdash;   huh?  I was in downtown Memphis a couple years ago, and I don&rsquo;t I ever saw so many empty storefronts.  Outside of Beale St., the place was nearly a ghost town in midday.</p>

		<p>There are decades of cases to support his contention and belief blacks will vote for a BLACK man over a white every time.  Even if that black is a buffoon, a cheat, under a cloud for corruption, or into drugs.  It&rsquo;s the McCain versus Obama syndrome.  McCain was absolutely startled that - being the closet liberal he is and having done SO much to enable liberal socialism - the media turned on him in favor of Obama and blacks and hispanics voted for Obama - an untried, unknown, nobody.  It&rsquo;s the black thing, stupid.  Blacks always figure even if the guy is corrupt, he will dole out more percs to blacks than anybody &#8220;not of color&#8221; regardless their complete pandering to blacks.<br>
Blacks do not rationalize.  They do not think.  They do not analyze and they do NOT have critical thinking skills.  All they see and think is skin color, and if somebody else has something they want and they can take it from them somehow.</p>
