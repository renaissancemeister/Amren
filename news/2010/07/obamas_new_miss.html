<h1>Obama&rsquo;s New Mission for NASA: Reach Out to Muslim World</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Byron York, Washington Examiner, July 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a far-reaching restatement of goals for the nation&rsquo;s space agency, NASA administrator Charles Bolden says President Obama has ordered him to pursue three new objectives: to &#8220;re-inspire children&#8221; to study science and math, to &#8220;expand our international relationships,&#8221; and to &#8220;reach out to the Muslim world.&#8221;  Of those three goals, Bolden said in a recent interview with al-Jazeera, the mission to reach out to Muslims is &#8220;perhaps foremost,&#8221; because it will help Islamic nations &#8220;feel good&#8221; about their scientific accomplishments.</p>
<p>In the same interview, Bolden also said the United States, which first sent men to the moon in 1969, is no longer capable of reaching beyond low earth orbit without help from other nations.</p>
<p>Bolden made the statements during a recent trip to the Middle East.  He told al-Jazeera that in the wake of the president&rsquo;s speech in Cairo last year, the American space agency is now pursuing &#8220;a new beginning of the relationship between the United States and the Muslim world.&#8221;  Then:</p>
<p>When I became the NASA Administrator  &mdash;  before I became the NASA Administrator  &mdash;  [Obama] charged me with three things: One was he wanted me to help re-inspire children to want to get into science and math, he wanted me to expand our international relationships, and third, and perhaps foremost, he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science, math, and engineering.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bolden&rsquo;s trip included a June 15 speech at the American University in Cairo.  In that speech, he said in the past NASA worked mostly with countries that are capable of space exploration.  But that, too, has changed in light of Obama&rsquo;s Cairo initiative.  &#8220;He asked NASA to change.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.by reaching out to &#8216;non-traditional&rsquo; partners and strengthening our cooperation in the Middle East, North Africa, Southeast Asia and in particular in Muslim-majority nations,&#8221; Bolden said.  &#8220;NASA has embraced this charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;NASA is not only a space exploration agency,&#8221; Bolden concluded, &#8220;but also an earth improvement agency.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Well&hellip;..one good thing about Obama is he is making it perfectly crystal clear what the difference between a white ruled and a non-white ruled America is like.</p>
<p>White ruled America reaches for the stars.  Non-white ruled America reaches for a cult of death, instead.</p>

		<p>Clearly, His Highness realizes that astronautics just &#8220;ain&rsquo;t a bleck thang.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s been too spectacularly successful   &mdash;   and much too offensively White   &mdash;   to fit in with his Multicultural Vison.</p>
<p>And so NASA must now be redefined in a way that makes the maximum number of nonWhites &#8220;feel good&#8221; about their &#8220;scientific accomplishments.&#8221;  And just exactly what &#8220;scientific accomplishments&#8221; have the Moslem world made since the Middle Ages?  Don&rsquo;t ask, you Racist, you.</p>
<p>It should be interesting to see how many NASA employees will be willing to sacrifice their jobs by protesting.<br>

		<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t the state department be in charge of our international relationships?  Why do we need to reach out to the muslim world?  Why is it (white) Americans responsibility to build up the egos of foreigners?  The world would be so much simpler if we just minded our own business and managed our own affairs, which we currently do very poorly.</p>
<p>We can trade with the muslim world without telling them how to live and without building up their egos.  We shouldn&rsquo;t impose on them and we shouldn&rsquo;t let them impose on us.  I am tired of the US being the world&rsquo;s policemen, the world&rsquo;s supplier of free bread, and the world&rsquo;s dumping ground.  </p>
<p>And what is with that baloney about NASA being the earth&rsquo;s improvement agency?  Last time I looked the US did not own the entire world.  And it was my understanding that NASA was founded for space exploration.  We should have had a moon base by now.  We should have had men on Mars.  Federal agencies should stick to their missions or shut down.</p>
<p>And as for &#8220;re-inspiring children&#8221; to study science, what a joke.  Third world people do not encourage their children to dream.  They rarely encourage their children to read and write.  Once their children become teens the children do what they want.  A third world nation does not have a huge reservoir of potential scientists, and we are pretty much a third world nation.  Yes, the new black and mestizo America will be the technological leader of the world.  Not.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;NASA is not only a space exploration agency,&rdquo; Bolden concluded, &ldquo;but also an earth improvement agency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This black has about the same qualifications to head NASA than I do to perform brain surgery.</p>
<p>Somebody tell me, please, what do these egghead types mean when they call the community organizer &#8220;brilliant?&#8221;  Are they so dim-witted themselves they are impressed with less than mediocrity?  Or are they so gullible they&rsquo;re no more than useless fools?</p>
<p>An MSNBC female crazy talked about how thrilled she felt after Obama&rsquo;s announcement that he was going to grant illegals amnesty as one of the greatest, most powerful speeches ever, even though it obviously wasn&rsquo;t written by him and was rife with exaggerations, childish misconceptions and upwards of two dozen lies.  Then there was the one who openly declared she hoped the Times Square bomber was a white man, because if he were a Muslim it might harm their image.  This, after hundreds of terrorist attacks throughout the world every year.</p>
<p>Then there were many other proclamations about this pitiful example of a president along the same lines.  Can these people be mouthing such inanities thinking it will help their careers somehow, because their plantation owners who sign their checks, or are influential some way, are pro-Obama at all costs and that unbiased reporting will mean not going along will hamper or end their media careers, so they feel forced into making such ghastly comments?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to believe all these people are so unintelligent, naive, or just plain stupid, but it&rsquo;s a very real possibility.  In any event it is a kind of shared madness that has no basis in fact and reveals the ugly face of corruption with every butt-kissing word they stupidly utter.</p>
<p>As one of the NYT&rsquo;s chief geeks, Paul Krugman, has declared, &#8220;We are now at the beginning of another depression,&#8221; while everything seems to be falling apart all around this community organizer as he stupidly refers to the Peace Corps, as the &#8220;Peace Corpse,&#8221; more than once, after he declares something about all 57 states, referring to the states in the union.  </p>
<p>If anybody is able to secure copies of his private records, I&rsquo;m betting we&rsquo;re going to see a person who gained nothing on his own, was not very bright, and has been rehearsed thousands of times beginning with his career as a community organizer, which is why he has to use the teleprompter so much.</p>
<p>Being black heads his list of priorities for appointment to office.  If he can&rsquo;t find one who can&rsquo;t even pretend to be qualified, he goes for next in line, which is a non-white.  As a last resort he will turn to a white BUT ONLY if that white is a left wing kook of one sort or another.</p>
<p>Carter did so much harm to this country it has affected us all these years.  Reagan repaired SOME of the damage but George Bush Sr. and Clinton were back with the same policies.  Their collective damage, however, is miniscule compared to what this white-hating black has done&hellip;and is doing right now&hellip;.to the country.  Appointing this incompetent black to NASA is only one of a thousand types of irrepairable harm he is guilty of.  We won&rsquo;t survive the &#8220;hope and change&#8221; from this moron, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p>Impeachment for incompetence, sedition, or any other gross crimes and misdemeanors will result in his calling for blacks to rise up and defend his honor against whites for disrespecting him.</p>

		<p>Here you&rsquo;ve got an agency filled with a lot of pretty bright people and who gets put in charge? Some slogan spouting bureaucrat, a guy with a nice career but whose ace in the hole is being black. It must be frustrating to work in some organization where the head honchos are political picks who always give others political sermons. The quoted statements seem incoherent considering this is NASA we&rsquo;re talking about, not the Peace Corp. Just part of the pattern of Detroitization of everything.    </p>

		<p>The racial makeup of NASA was the reason Obama cut funding and tossed plans to go back to the Moon.  Obama doesn&rsquo;t want to give money to white people.  He wants to &#8220;level&#8221; the playing field by disadvantaging &#8220;white&#8221; NASA so non-white space agencies can surpass us.</p>

		<p>This is a sign of a declining nation: rather than pursuing concrete goals such as space exploration, it pursues namby-pamby, abstract, ethereal and insubstantial goals like &ldquo;re-inspiring children&rdquo; (putting a man on the moon wasn&rsquo;t inspiring?) and &ldquo;expanding our international relationships,&#8221; whatever that means.</p>

<p>I have seen some truly bizarre rubbish come out of this administration, but Comrade Bolden&rsquo;s drivel here and at his Red master&rsquo;s direction, is beyond stupid or even<br>
wretchedly &ldquo;intellectually challenged.&rdquo; Who cares, I ask, if Muslims &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; about their so-called &ldquo;scientific accomplishments?&rdquo; As if trading a goat for a woman or blowing themselves and others up with rudimentary explosives, were original in that part of the world.  </p>
<p>NASA has one purpose and one purpose: to explore and colonize this galaxy for US interests only, not to heighten the self-esteem of deranged nomads and terrorists. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>Let me clear up this myth.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, much of the texts of the Greeks were lost to Europeans.</p>
<p>The science, medicine, and engineering the Muslims were engaged in were founded on ancient Greek texts.</p>
<p>It was the Renaissance that allowed Europeans to re-discover the knowledge of the Greeks. In my opinion, the Renaissance of the western mind continues to this day (obstructed only by political correctness, the new dark age).<br>

One has to be blind or in denial if they still believe that we even have a country any longer. How easily we have let it all slip away. Guess the White American will go out with a whimper. This used to be OUR land intended only for us and our progeny. We see what happens when we and those before us allowed the immigration of nonwhites into our land and made them citizens.

<p> Ya know, that muslim in the White House also talks about the &#8216;contributions&rsquo; that muslims have made to this country. WHAT ARE THEY??? I&rsquo;d really like to know. If they&rsquo;re so good at science, math, and engineering, why are their countries such hellholes! The same with Africa. Blacks claim to have invented everything from the wheel to the space shuttle in this country, but yet going to most of Africa is like going back to the stone age. </p>
<p> And while I&rsquo;m at it, what is a black man doing running NASA? When you think NASA, do you think black people? Didn&rsquo;t think so! No one does, not even blacks. Of course 50 yrs. from now it&rsquo;ll be written that blacks invented the space program and Whites came along and &#8220;stoled&#8221; it from them.  <br>

		<p>This makes sense, in that it is consistent with the far-left philosophy of equality: Take a bunch of angry under-achievers and tell them they are as good as the achievers even if everyone knows it&rsquo;s a lie.  If the lie by itself doesn&rsquo;t work, give them money and repeat the lie.  If it still isn&rsquo;t working, give them more money, undeserved credit, and repeat the lie ad-nauseum.  With NASA engaging the Muslim world, we are now at the first stage.  The second stage will be to employ Muslim Imams as Astronauts so they can preach the destruction of the West from space, and the third stage will be for us to give them our ICBM technology and subsequently give them credit for developing geospatial coordinate geometry.  I wonder if NASA thinks the Religion of Peace will use THAT knowledge to try a little &#8220;earth improvement&#8221;?</p>

		<p>This affirmative action president misses the whole points that NASA is a highly competitive agency.  It is not a good feeling agency.  The present Arabs are not of the same genetic composition as in the past.  So why is it this country&rsquo;s responsibility to include uneducated Muslins to be part of a highly technical program?  The Obamas got into those goods schools when it was required that blacks had to be admitted just as today.  He was president of law review because Harvard needed to project a certain image.  Just as in Congress, Obama did not write a single article.  This country needs to re-examine the delusions that blacks and hispanics have the genes to think and function abstractly.</p>

		<p> Is it just me, or isn&rsquo;t this really, really, really big news? The main mission of NASA is to make friends with Muslims? How did this get to be NASA&rsquo;s job? This is beyond incredible. The only thing more difficult to believe is that the news doesn&rsquo;t have this on the front page. Is Obama now getting his policies from Saturday Night Live skits?

How true is this statement? Does it matter? It is propaganda, and serves the Globalist agenda. 1. Weaken national identity.<br>
2. Force acceptance of &#8220;globalism&#8221; as inevitable. 3. Place<br>
power in the hands of trans national forces.  4. Intimidate<br>

		<p>This, by far, is the most insane thing I have ever heard, ever in my life. What the hell scientific contributions have muslims made? Does he think that since they advanced algebra, oh, 1300 years ago, that it&rsquo;s okay for them to continually work against scientific and social advancement, going so far as to murder people, blow up buildings and vehicles, and do anything at all to kill anyone who disagrees with them? Is that his reason for rewarding them? He&rsquo;s literally fighting against scientific advancement and progress by shifting the focus of nasa away from science and towards a black social agenda. </p>

<p>Re NASA&rsquo;s outreach to Moon-based faiths:</p>
<p>Some readers will be familiar with the angry black &#8220;poet&#8221; Gil Scott-Heron&rsquo;s loving ode to Da Man&rsquo;s space program, &#8220;Whitey On The Moon&#8221; from the 1980s. WARNING: If you are of an AR persuasion, this video may make you very angry&hellip;<br>
 <br>

 <br>
Well, Gil, now your Black Moses has taken Whitey OFF the moon. Moreover, he&rsquo;s redirecting space-exploration resources toward making nonwhites feel better about their (extremely skimpy) &#8220;scientific&#8221; accomplishments. You must be happy now, right?<br>
 <br>
Whaddya mean &#8220;No&#8221;?<br>

<p>What does any of this have to do with the space program? Our glorious black Messiah is determined to politicize and destroy everything he touches. He sees NASA as yet another government instrument for spreading leftist propaganda. If that&rsquo;s what NASA has become, then it has no purpose at all and should just be eliminated.</p>
<p>Spengler said that the prime symbol of Faustian Culture was infinite space. Faustian Man, i.e., white Western Man, is constantly driven to expand his horizons. NASA has always been political to one extent or another, but this irresistable push to explore and expand has always been at the very heart of the space program  &mdash;  something the Obamanation simply can&rsquo;t comprehend because he&rsquo;s not part of the West.</p>
<p>Things like this remind me of the old Soviet Union. To the Party, every institution in society was political: sports, chess, industry, ballet, you name it. They all had to be ideologically correct and they were all used to push the party line. The Central Committee saw all facets of society as instruments of world revolution.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s not a straight-ahead Commie, however. He&rsquo;s really kind of schizophrenic, if you ask me. On the one hand, he&rsquo;s a typical leftist, but on the other hand, he&rsquo;s a typical corrupt Chicago politician, a hand-puppet for the likes of British Petroleum and Goldman Sachs, some of the biggest crooks in the world.  Having him as President is like catching your wife in bed with Karl Marx, Sam Giancana, Al Gore, Herman Van Rompuy, Ben Bernanke and Hamid Karzai. It&rsquo;s hard to describe this kind of corruption.</p>
<p>The really stunning part of this story is the admission that the United States &#8220;is no longer capable of reaching beyond low earth orbit without help from other nations.&#8221; If this is true, it shows just how much NASA  &mdash;  and by extension the entire country  &mdash;  has declined over the last fifty years. Somehow, though, I doubt if this Charles Bolden character has the slightest idea what NASA can do or not do. Putting him in charge of NASA is an insult to an agency which put a man on the moon and landed robotic probes on Mars. If NASA is screwed up now, it will never survive this kind of administration.</p>

		<p>I want to set a few things straight.  First of all, semetic people in the Middle East with brown skin who originated from the Arabian Peninsula, ARE NOT WHITE.  I don&rsquo;t know why people assume arabs to have been much whiter at one time than they are now.  Even if this were true, what difference does it make?</p>
<p>Second, there are hardly any historic achievements of ARAB Muslims.  Islamic civilization took over areas that were enriched by mostly Indo-European science (Greek, Byzantine, Persian, Indian etc&hellip;..).   They added very little to this science.  As a matter of fact, why is it always during the high points in white European history that the most science world-wide is produced?  The Greeks did a lot, very little was done during the Middle Ages, and then during the European Renaissance, it takes off again.</p>
<p>Third, I find this story very alarming.  I can already predict what will happen.  White people will once again stop producing in a field that they invented.  Meanwhile, the East Asians will take it and run with it, and ten years from now everyone will be saying that the Chinese invented space exploration.  I mean, it seems that most white people are already ignorant enough to believe that the Japanese were the first to invent robots and television sets, the Koreans invented cloning, and that the Chinese invented speed trains, green technology and electric cars, just because they are the people currently &#8220;leading technologically in those fields&#8221; according to the mass media. </p>
<p>Wake up white people! I am sick of your naivety!</p>

		<p>Right now I am so angry I have a headache!  I just got done listening to the Micheal S. show.  I can&rsquo;t say his last name fully because it won&rsquo;t go through the filters on Amren. To give you a hint, his last name is an unpolite term for Native Americans and &#8220;uncivilized&#8221; people Europeans came into contact with.  </p>
<p>Hopefully everyone knows who I am talking about.  Anyways, sometimes I listen to his show for inspiration, but I find more and more that, while he makes good points in regards to politics, he gets his facts wrong when discussing cultures and races.</p>
<p>I waited for his show to start tonight because I was excited about what he would say on this matter dealing with NASA.  He spent more time talking about what a great, intelligent, war hero Bolden is, than he did bashing Obama&rsquo;s idea to reach out to Muslims.  He also spent way too much time reminding us that he isn&rsquo;t racist by telling us that he recognizes that the Muslims invented zero, Algebra, Arabic numerals etc&hellip;..</p>
<p>A caller called in and had to explain to him that zero and Arabic numerals came from India.  The caller also went into how most &#8220;Muslim&#8221; accomplishments were developed by Jews and Christians under Muslim rule.  </p>
<p>Micheal S. responded by going into how tolerant the Muslims of that time were.  The caller responded by saying that he is wrong, and that those Christians and Jews made all those discoveries BEFORE the Muslims drove them out.  Micheal S. completely disregarded the topic on Christians and immediately goes into how &#8220;it is just like how the Germans lost WW2 after driving the brilliant Jews out of Germany&#8221;.</p>
<p>Whenever Micheal S. talks about this topic on his show, I never hear him mention the Greeks.  The Greeks were probably the most generous donators of science to the Muslim world.  Micheal S. NEVER talks about them at all on his show.  And if he talks about Rome, it is in a mocking way, and he reminds us of how sexually promiscuous they were there.</p>
<p>Of course Micheal S. also reminded us that Islam DID NOT diminish in science because the people in that part of the world have low IQs.  Oh no.  He had to remind us that they &#8221; are among the brightest people in the world&#8221;.</p>
<p>I have heard Micheal S. say that Jews &#8220;are among the brightest people in the world&#8221;, and I have heard him say the same about arabs, Indians, and Chinese people.  He says this on his show a little too much, in fact.  One time he even said that if we let all East Asians, including Indians immigrate to America, America would be a better place.</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t I ever heard Micheal S. say &#8220;the Greeks were among the brightest people in the world&#8221;.  Why haven&rsquo;t I heard him say the same about white Christians, or just white people in general?</p>
<p>After tonight&rsquo;s show I am never listening to him ever again.  I thought he was supposed to be a voice for white America, but I have yet to hear him discuss on his show the many great scientific achievements of Europeans.  Even on tonight&rsquo;s show when he was supposedly criticizing Obama for pandering to Muslims, he fails to mention how most &#8220;Muslim science&#8221; came from Greece.</p>
<p>I also find it funny that his website is very racially conscious and non-PC in that it is constantly full of articles about Third World people around the world and here in America doing horrendous things.  It is almost as if he is a different person on the internet than he strives to appear to be on his radio show.</p>
<p>This is the last draw.  No more listening to his show for me.</p>

		<p>A while back I happened to see a PC evaluation of the movie &#8220;Apollo XIII&#8221; in which the reviewer wanted to use it to teach schoolchildren about the &#8220;racism&#8221; of those terrible times  &mdash;  after all, there are just about no minorities in Mission Control! Of course, the obvious lesson was lost:  that White men put a man on the Moon (via the Apollo program) and were also able to gin up a rescue in space of the damaged Apollo XIII spacecraft and its crew. </p>
<p>And here we are some four decades later, with all the affirmative action and ethnic studies programs and diversity brainwashing in the world, and yet the American space program has come to a dead end. Remember the days when it was expected that America would have a base on the Moon by 2001? An older generation of science fiction writers even had colonies on Mars by 2010. Well, that dream is gone  &mdash;  at least for the USA.  </p>
<p>It just may be that whatever impetus there was for the USA to put men into space was a product of White peoples&rsquo; civilization, the same impetus that led to the great age of exploration, and then to the pioneering of the American West.  By dispossessing the sort of people who once were willing to trek on out to new frontiers, the current political order has also killed any chance of space exploration. </p>
<p><i>It is very sad now to have my children/grandchildren ask me &ldquo;Did they really put a man on the Moon back then?&rdquo;<br>
</i></p>
<p>Undoubtedly. The days of the American manned space program will go down as an the days of great legends in the far future, as American decline accelerates. Still, we might see other peoples taking up the banner. </p>

<p><i>The science, medicine, and engineering the Muslims were engaged in were founded on ancient Greek texts.</i></p>
<p>One wonders how many scientific and engineering advances were <i>lost  </i>owing to the onslaught of Islamic armies into the Byzantine and Western world from the 7th century AD on?  The Roman Empire and its heirs were well advanced in all of these fields, as well as philosophy, architecture, and mathematics. </p>
<p>Consider all the destruction wrought by the Islamic invasions, which didn&rsquo;t really end until the 17th century. And consider the energy the Byzantines and Western kingdoms needed to expend to deal with various Islamic invaders, raiders, and mass migrants. Might the world be far in advance of where it is today had Islam remained confined to the Arabian peninsula? </p>
<p>One thing that always staggers me is how Western liberals can beat their breasts with guilt over a couple of centuries of European imperialism, but completely ignore the impact of a millennium and a half of Islamic depredations against the West. </p>

<p>Interesting point, but I find it odd that someone way back in the 80s said that.  Here we are in 2010 and the Chinese have yet to land on the moon even though it has already been done by other people for them to use as an example.  It will be interesting to see how far China gets without white people having a stake in space exploration. </p>
<p>I am not ready to throw in the towel, just yet.  Just by reading all sorts of articles on the internet on this topic, and the sorts of comments they are generating, it appears that 99% of white males are absolutely furious about this.  Again, this is just going by the sorts of comments I am reading under these articles I come across.</p>
<p>The Chinese aren&rsquo;t entitled to any of this stuff.  It is only through our own stupidity that they learn our technology to begin with. I am sick of liberals talking as if &#8220;it is our turn to step aside, &hellip;.this is China&rsquo;s century, &hellip;..they deserve the spot in the world that we currently occupy&#8221;. </p>
<p>Really?  Then let them go back to the 1400s and start from scratch where they left off.</p>
<p>As a side note, I thought it was funny that during the debates Obama made a huge deal out of the Chinese going on a space walk, and then stating to McCain &#8220;&hellip;we need to keep up&#8221;.  I still can&rsquo;t figure out what in the world he thought he was talking about.  </p>
<p>Number one, the Chinese are NOT ahead of us in space exploration, just because they go on a space walk.  It is impossible for them to be ahead of us if they haven&rsquo;t landed on the moon yet.  This is just like if he were to say &#8220;India has provided most of its population with toilets&hellip;.we need to keep up&#8221;.  Number two, wouldn&rsquo;t that be what he would want anyways?  It appears to be turning out that way by looking at his recent actions.</p>
<p>I am sick of how liberals in general enjoy pointing fingers at white people in Red State America and the Bible Belt, blaming us for the reasons America is starting to lag behind in so many ways.  Yet at the same time they seem to look forward to the day China takes over everything, while Red State, RC Cola drinking, Bubba and Billy Bob, want to see NASA stay on top of the world. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying we need to go Vrilish (though field effect mechanics would certainly be THE revolution that opens space) but anyone who knows anything about getting out of a gravity well under internal oxidizer and fuel sourcing, knows it&rsquo;s a case of diminishing returns.  Of course we farked around with the &#8216;heroic manned space flight&rsquo; and the orbiter nonsense, making things -worse- with the manned recovery element of the system (why the French and Chinese now lead the world in launch services) but the reality is that getting to a high transfer or even GSO is nothing -once you are in orbit-.  But getting there, without massive payload deficiencies, is just never going to be possible unless you go NASP with a hybrid scramjet to suck off and liquify atmospheric oxygen for the last phase (probably also requiring slush phase hydrogen).  Or better yet: nuclear.  Nuclear could solve 90% of our local exploration issues and at least make a Mars trip -feasible-.</p>
<p>But the reality is and must be that until we gain payload margin back and diminish the turnaround issues of conventional liquid or solid launch, space travel is stuck at the biplane level of utility.</p>
<p>FWIW, I also find it ludicrous to go to Mars just to plant another flag and of questionable value to go to the moon just to have a &#8216;permanent&rsquo; microgravity high school science lab.  The latter doesn&rsquo;t get us to Mars much more effectively than starting in LEO does (I am -highly- sceptical of the ability to mine oxygen and other key consumeables from Luna).  And Mars is such a total hole that simply spending a year fighting our biology to get there and then come home again, after a fortnight seems to me to be a really great way to waste another trillion dollars or three.  If I wanted to go to Mars, I would start with more advanced robots than the Tamiya RC dune buggy&rsquo;s we have so far been playing with.  Autonomous, atomic powered ATBM would be my starting point, along with robotic services installers to basically set up a survivable, subterranean, rad and meteor proof bunker would be the way I would start.  And ONLY then, once the remote video and pressure sensors determined we had a survivable nut-hut, would I send humans to &#8216;study&rsquo; whatever.</p>
<p>The current system of a year in space and several weeks putting up tents is a massively risky one for which the real probability of watching our people take poison pills because something went wrong and there was -literally- nothing we could do to help them was a high likelihood outcome.</p>
<p>And again, as with Luna, I just don&rsquo;t think Mars is or ever will be worth much beyond a &#8216;veni vidi vici&rsquo; ego trip for a bunch of space jocks.</p>
<p>If you want to know the key sciences where we should be putting BILLIONS of dollars every year it is these three and only these three:</p>
<p>1.  Robotics.<br>
However dumb the human species or it&rsquo;s constituent races are, what makes them dangerous is the amount of recompense they expect for doing dull-dirty-dangerous jobs.  Robots (As anthropomorphic Terminators that do stoop labor) could change EVERYTHING we know about the value of economies.  A robot could be a superior brain surgeon.  But not as good a hairdresser.</p>
<p>2.  Fusion.<br>
If you want cheap green energy, skip renewables as solar or wind and go straight ot the source.  Right now, we are spending less that 20 million a year on ONE facility in the States studying ONE approach.  It needs to be order of magnitude increased at least.  Why is this important?  If you want to get people onboard, politically, with the &#8216;proposition nation&rsquo; idea of a centrist society, offer them something that doesn&rsquo;t get spent like a stimulus, in six months.  Offer them and their kids free electricity for LIFE.  Think that doesn&rsquo;t matter?  You spend between 150-200 dollars a month in a single family home for juice.  That&rsquo;s something like 54-72,000 dollars over the span of a 30 year mortgage.  Can you not find a better way to spend that money?</p>
<p>3.  Genetics.<br>
We will -never- beat computers and robotics for raw performance in either mental or physical capabilities.  But we can do the next best thing which is to reduce our footprint to the level where we no longer worry about competing with the machine dictates of our lives and simply allow them to help us have a better, more profound, experience of &#8216;just living&rsquo;.  To get there we need to raise the bar entirely on a universal level of mean intelligence to at least 120.  This will, in a generation or two, give us the kinds of technical innovations where AI can begin to help us implement even newer technologies.  At the same time we ourselves have a way of communicating with each other at a common level about social issues.  And the latter is what is really important.  Because until we agree to a mutual system of restrictions and advantages, we will always be held back by envy and mistrust.  On religious or nationalist or assorted other, fundamentally primitive and flawed, excuses for &#8216;conservatism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In getting to these particular kinds of technical improvement, I don&rsquo;t think any of our federal agencies or R&D; institutions are qualified for much the same reason that the automobile was not developed by &#8216;official means&rsquo;.  You need to have a dedicated, civilian, technology enablement system that is not crippled by the hero complex of the military (current paymaster to our university R&D; system) and which follows different cost:benefit priorities for reliability and useful vs. ultimate performance.</p>
<p>With most of the necessary capabilities improvements in these areas of science and engineering not requiring any of the supposed benefits of NASA based &#8216;expertise&rsquo;, I would, by far, rather see their roles severely restricted to only those things (like the hypersonics X-43) which directly effect fast transit commerce and cheaper earth-orbit access.  Even if only at the most basic of engineering studies levels.</p>
<p>Obama and Co. may be the great sabotagers of the White American exploratory dream of spaceflight and exploration but when you look at what that dream has brought us in the way of real, visible, improvements in modern society, the cost does not support the hero complex.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think space exploration and your suggestions are mutually exclusive   &mdash;   AMAF, we simply MUST do Fusion/Genetics/Robotics if any real future human space travel is feasible.  Then and only then, I, like you, think the Moon is too uninteresting.  Mars first, and the first colonists should go there to stay, after the bots have done their thing.  The return trip is why Mars budgets shoot intolerably high.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Those texts WERE European. They were Greek.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Yes, they were works of the western world.</p>
<p>But during the Dark Ages, the west lost access to these works. It was only when calm returned to Europe that Europeans re-discoved these writings.</p>
<p>If anything, the Muslims preserved these writings until Europe was stable again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Muslims never advanced science beyond what they learned from ancient writings. They could translate them and apply the science but they couldn&rsquo;t take the leap to keep advancing science like the west has done.</p>
<p>In my view, the Renaissance never ended in the west (that is until the advent of the new dark ages, political correctness).</p>
