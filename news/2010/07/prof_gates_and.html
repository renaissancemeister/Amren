<h1>Gates and Crowley: H.L. Gates Gets a Whitewash</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> July 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Last month, a committee that was set up to investigate the famous arrest in Cambridge of black Harvard don Henry Louis Gates issued its file <a href="/news/2010/07/06/Gates_Arrest_Review.pdf" target="pdf" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>final report.</b></a> The press covered it briefly, perhaps one in a million Americans read it, and it dropped from sight. It deserved a lot better. It deserved to be spotlighted as a perfect example of the contemptible rubbish official America writes about race.</p>
<p>The Cambridge Review Committee was set up because the Cambridge police chief, Robert Haas, thought valuable lessons could be learned from the July 2009 arrest that dominated the news and prompted the ridiculous &#8220;beer summit&#8221; at the White House. The committee, made up of a dozen fancy volunteers  &mdash;  mostly academics, but a few police administrators  &mdash;  chewed through $210,000, missed several deadlines, and finally issued 60 pages of what could be dismissed as pap, were it not for the fact that it is dangerous pap.</p>
<p>The press correctly noted that the report, called <cite>Missed Opportunities; Shared Responsibilities,</cite> said Prof. Gates and Sergeant James Crowley shared equal blame for the incident. The report then went on to make 10 official recommendations: Police departments must be reformed. Not one of the 10 suggested that the likes of Prof. Gates should cooperate with the police. Perhaps most astonishing, the Cambridge Review Committee issued this set of intrusive, costly recommendations <em>without even trying to find out what really happened.</em></p>
<p>The committee recognized that the sergeant and the professor gave very different accounts. Sergeant Crowley said (see James Crowley&rsquo;s Arrest Reports, pages 1 and 2, below) that the professor refused to cooperate, accused him of racism, shouted throughout the encounter, told the officer he didn&rsquo;t know whom he was &#8220;messing with,&#8221; threatened reprisals, and shouted, &#8220;I&rsquo;ll speak with your momma outside&#8221; when Sergeant Crowley invited him to come out of the house if he wanted to talk.</p>
<p>Despite warnings to calm down, Prof. Gates continued to shout, attracting a crowd, and Sergeant Crowley arrested him for disorderly conduct. Officer Carlos Figueroa, the second officer on the scene, filed <a href="/news/2010/07/06/Arrest-Report-3-large.jpg " target="page_3" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none">a report of his own</a> that is completely consistent with Sergeant Crowley&rsquo;s. By the time of the arrest, a black officer was present and he said later that he considered the arrest fully justified. The committee report doesn&rsquo;t mention him.</p>
<p>Prof. Gates&rsquo;s version was a little different. He told the committee that after he and his driver pushed through the front door of the house, they saw an elderly woman staring at them, and that the driver wondered if she might not be &#8220;calling the police on them.&#8221; Prof. Gates therefore knew that what the two had done might bring the police. Nevertheless, he said that as soon as Sergeant Crowley appeared and spoke to him, &#8220;all the hairs stood up on the back of my neck and I realized that I was in danger.&#8221; His account included nothing about non-cooperation, shouting, remarks about &#8220;your momma,&#8221; or threats of reprisal. He did concede that he said to Sergeant Crowley, &#8220;You&rsquo;re not responding because I am a black man and you are a white officer,&#8221; but made it sound as though he was arrested on a whim.</p>
<p>The Cambridge Review Committee says it was not asked to try to find out what really happened adding, rather stupidly, that any such effort would &#8220;likely prove fruitless.&#8221; Fruitless? By the time of the arrest, there were half-a-dozen police officers in front of Prof. Gates&rsquo;s house. The woman who had called in the report of a break in had been there from the beginning, and there was a crowd of rubber-neckers. There were plenty of ways to learn the truth, but the committee admits it <em>doesn&rsquo;t care what happened:</em><blockquote>&#8220;Even if conclusions could be reached [about the facts], the Committee is unanimous in believing that such a narrow focus would miss the larger picture. What matters in this case is that two well-regarded people  &mdash;  one white, one black; one an experienced and well-trained police sergeant, one an eminent scholar  &mdash;  experienced the same event and drew radically divergent conclusions about the implications of what happened.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>In other words, it makes no difference if Prof. Gates is lying. It makes no difference if he was abusive and belligerent. It makes no difference if he acted like a spoiled child and got exactly what he deserved. The committee <em>doesn&rsquo;t even want to know.</em> All that matters to it is that a black and a white had different reactions to what happened.</p>
<p>This is just like campuses that go into an uproar over a noose or the word &#8220;nigger,&#8221; only to find that a black student did it. Don&rsquo;t worry, says the administration, all that white breast-beating was good because there <em>is</em> so much racism in the world, and the little dear who did it just needs a little counseling. What actually happened doesn&rsquo;t matter so long as blacks have a grievance.</p>
<p>So now we have the Cambridge Review Committee, on the basis of avowed, deliberate ignorance of the facts, pronouncing the professor and the officer equally to blame, and telling every police department in America to shape up. Police have to be trained in &#8220;inter-personal communication,&#8221; they have to understand the limits of police discretion, they have to &#8220;engage the community,&#8221; and they have to host &#8220;community forums.&#8221; Most insulting of all, the Cambridge Police Department has to change its hiring procedures to get recruits with the right &#8220;skills, abilities, and character traits.&#8221; By all accounts, Sergeant Crowley is about as fine an officer as any department in the country can hope to get. To conclude from this incident that the recruitment procedures that got him on the Cambridge force are defective is pandering of the most disgusting kind.</p>
<p>Like so many people, the members of the Cambridge Review Committee are probably capable of sequential thought on most subjects, but when the subject is race they become morons. In no other context would they cheerfully say they don&rsquo;t even know what happened but then roll out a truckload of recommendations that require reform from only one side. Despite having almost a year to think about the incident, the committee behaved exactly as Barack Obama did when he first heard about it: Blame whitey even if you don&rsquo;t know what happened.</p>
<p>To anyone with a functioning brain it is clear that there would have been no unpleasantness if Prof. Gates had held his tongue and done as he was asked, but Prof. Gates couldn&rsquo;t do that. He is a professional &#8220;racism&#8221; hunter, constantly on the prowl for white wickedness. He has made a long career of blaming the white man, and here, maybe for the first time in his life, was a chance to be a real victim. Practically the first thing he did was bellow about racism, and he was still bellowing  &mdash;  to a gathering crowd  &mdash;  when the cuffs went on.</p>
<p>The committee should have made only one recommendation, and it should have made it to black people: Be polite to the police. By putting even part of the blame for the arrest on Sergeant Crowley, and by refusing to condemn Prof. Gates&rsquo;s stupidity and arrogance, the committee is only encouraging more black stupidity and self-importance  &mdash;  and giving more and more whites reason to despise their rulers.</p>

<p>What do you think the odds are that Gates pre-planned this whole set of events, possibly days, weeks or even months before the &#8220;incident?&#8221;  My take is that he was jealous that even kookier kooks like his Harvard contemporary Cornell West was getting all the &#8220;glory&#8221; in the Age of Obama, and he was worried about becoming irrelevant.</p>

I too would have missed this prime example of circa-2010 &#8220;thinking&#8221; about Race from obscurity   &mdash;   so thank you, Mr. Taylor, for rescuing it from obscurity. And your analysis of the report&rsquo;s reflexive anti-white stupidity is spot-on. </p>

Another expertly executed evisceration of a race lie.</p>
<p>As with Jena and the Duke Non-rape case, the Gates incident goes to show how quickly and the one-sided media and race-hustler pundits are at constructing racial fairy tales with skewed &lsquo;facts&rsquo;, implied motives, and over-the-top emotional excess.</p>
<p>After Gates and his driver were seen attempting to enter the Gates home, Officer Crowley had good reason to demand proof that Gates had reason to be in his own home; domestic violence.</p>
<p>While Prof. Gates may have had proof he lived at the address, a well-trained police officer should be suspicious about anyone, even an owner, forcibly entering their own home. Had Prof. Gates, for example, been involved in a domestic incident with his wife, Prof. Gates may have had a restraining order placed against him by his wife. The responding officer will need some time to do a background check. Let&rsquo;s say Prof. Gates had a restraining order against him and Officer Crowley simply accepted his license as proof of legal residence and Prof. Gates then attacked and injured his estranged wife, Officer Crowley would have been crucified by feminists and womens&rsquo; groups for not following departmental protocol. Damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Also, while Officer Crowley was interviewing Prof. Gates, what was Officer Crowley to make of the second man who was reportedly seen with Prof. Gates but was not present? Any police officer would have been concerned about a second suspect he couldn&rsquo;t locate.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor, maybe there&rsquo;s another book for you to write concerning Jena, Duke, Gates, and others, &#8220;The Anatomy of a Race Lie&#8221;.</p>

<p><br>
I have been noticing this phenomenon more and more lately. I speak of the tendency to avoid making any decisions or value judgements by opting to blame BOTH parties equally and be done with it. For instance, it has been mentioned here on Amren recently the tendency for schools to punish BOTH parties for fighting when a black child has been picking on a white one. That way, administrators spare themselves the accusation of racism or favoritism.  It&rsquo;s taking the easy way out. Thus, it doesn&rsquo;t pay for the abused child to complain. </p>
<p>When we look around, we see this cowardly behavior everywhere   &mdash;   in government, corporations, etc.  Regardless of guilt or innocence, nobody dares punish the black party unless the white party is punished as well.  </p>
<p>Equal punishment for all is not justice. It is the opposite. How far will this &#8220;equality&#8221; madness go?</p>

		<p>This type of behavior is no different than Maxine Waters screamly racism when she like everyone else has to go through security check before entering the Capital.  It has gotten so bad that her picture has been given to all DC cops and security guards so that she can walk right in and also will not be stopped while the street.  What is to gain by pandering to these crazy people?  If it is so bad here, they are more than welcome to leave.  Just leave and we will all be happy.</p>
<p>What is this black man teaching at Harvard that is so beneficial to this country?  I would not be surprised if all he does and rant and scream while &#8220;teaching&#8221; as like Obama&rsquo;s preacher.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s incidents like this one that makes me believe more firmly than ever that this country has no whites with any backbone in positions of authority.  </p>
<p>Even O&rsquo;Reilly was playing the Black Panther incident down tonight, terrified to report the racist language and violent threats by the Panthers and ignored authentic information that the blacks and Hispanics in the Dept of Justice have made it clear numerous times that blacks will not be prosecuted for cases like the Panther case where whites are the victims, reported by the whistle blower Adams and no less than five other attornys in the Justice Department.</p>
<p>There just doesn&rsquo;t seem to be whites in the media or in leadership positions who will denounce black crime and misbehavior.  As a result, obviously, even more black on white incidents will occur.</p>

<p>Normally I agree with what you say, but you are stretching with your post. I cannot see Professor Gates to use your term &#8220;planning&#8221; such an incident to remain relevant. He is one of the most well-known an sought after professors in the nation. He has written for several influential magazines over the past decade or so. </p>
<p>Why would he put his one could argue enviable career in jeopardy by &#8220;planning&#8221; to get arrested by the Cambridge police?</p>
<p>Do you honestly beleive this was his intention? If you are being fecetious, I apologize.   </p>

		<p>Another elegantly clear article from Jared.  I sometimes imagine what it must have been like to agree with Galileo and wonder if the rest of the world had gone stark, raving mad.  Orwell was right, this kind of doublethink can only be the result of self-delusion, it is too preposterous to be wilful.</p>
<p>The truth will win through in the end but will it be in time to preserve us?  We are close to the tipping point, once we lose our lands to the control of other races it&rsquo;ll be the devil&rsquo;s own work to get them back.</p>
<p>A majority black country is not in anyone&rsquo;s interest, not even blacks.</p>

		<p>In college I locked my keys in my car parked in front of my dorm and had to use a bent metal ruler to pop the side window vent.  It was night and I was the only one in the lot but someone must have seen me and reported it to campus police.</p>
<p>Unlike Gates, I calmly clarified the situation and identified myself as the owner and the PO went on his way.  I didn&rsquo;t flip out and shout that I was a victim of gender or age discrimination because I fit the profile of someone who would break into cars.  I understood why it might look suspicious seeing someone trying to break into a car, justifying a call to the police.</p>

		<p>Re. posts 1 &amp; 2,  I doubt that Gates actually &#8220;planned&#8221; the incident in advance (although anything is possible), but I do think that he very deliberately and consciously took advantage of the opportunity when it arose. He milked it for all it was worth and played to the media, with all that yelling and carrying on. </p>
<p>Knowing that his pal was in the White House, he knew that this was his moment to &#8220;do his thing&#8221;.  And he did it! He was making a national statement and got the attention that he wanted.  He knew he might never have another opportunity like this again.  It was a case of &#8220;now or never&#8221;.</p>
<p>Like the Rosa Parks thing,  so many of these &#8220;civil rights&#8221; incidents have been staged. It&rsquo;s all so cynical when you come down to it.</p>

		<p>All the Gates incident did was prove to white Americans that blacks are likely to shout racism and police mistreatment over the slightest circumstance.  And police higher-ups, just like those in other government bureaucracies, will respond with PC pablum and go on to the next matter.  Very likely, these same hand-wringers actually agree with rank-and-file cops that blacks are largely a bother.  <br>
We should actually be glad that such incidents occur, because it shows how much difficulty blacks even in the highest positions have in dealing with their ethnicity and with common-sense logic regarding their interactions with non-blacks.  As we know, Obama acted no better.  Hopefully, Americans will think long and hard before ever voting for him again.</p>

		<p>Anytime there is a conflict between blacks and whites (or blacks and non-blacks for that matter) the establishment will always excuse the blacks and scapegoat the white person. This is a rule that is followed 100% of the time.</p>
<p>Academics, politicians, journalists, religious leaders, economists, businessmen and others are always searching for ways to &#8220;heal our differences&#8221; and &#8220;bring people together.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the fact is that blacks have always been a &#8220;troublesome presence,&#8221; to use the words of Abraham Lincoln. They will continue to be a troublesome presence and those parts of the world that have lots of blacks will always be problematic.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s very charitable of Mr. Taylor to imply that black stupidity is curable.</p>
<p>BTW, I&rsquo;m vaguely acquainted with a prodigy of Gates who is now a professor at a pretty good university. She&rsquo;s certainly ambitious, but just doesn&rsquo;t seem all that smart. A black with a PhD is probably about like anybody else with a bachelor&rsquo;s, just like a black with a bachelor&rsquo;s is about like anybody else with an 8th grade education.</p>

		<p>What angers me so much about this is that M. Taylor could send a copy of his well-written article to every PSM outlet in the entire country and not one would print it.</p>
<p>And, not one PSM TV station will come forth with offers of interviews. </p>
<p>Not One.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, jerks like this racist professor are free to rant and rave and lie about the threat of White racism and the PSM and government fawn all over them, defend their lies, demand redress for &#8216;victims&rsquo; and demand that White racism be quashed.</p>
<p>Yet black thugs clearly threatening White voters is a non-issue.  The DOJ refuses to defend us. The media refuse to print black-on-White crime statistics.  The government refuses to allow ANY White advocacy groups.  What does this tell you about our fate?</p>
<p>Does anyone out there not believe We Whites are being dehumanized and vilified,  under suspicion as vicious racists, set up as a scapegoat for all the world&rsquo;s miseries?  Is the non-White population not given the impression that Whites must be harshly suppressed by the government lest we release our true nature  &mdash;  that of vicious, murderous racists?</p>
<p>The Internet and to a lesser extent talk radio are all we have  &mdash;  look for the government to go after them if obama is re-elected, with a vengeance, with calls for censorship of Hate Sites or implications of Hate Speech or screams for Fairness.</p>
<p>You can be sure the new Supreme Court nominee, kagan, will support calls for censorship/dismantling/government control of the Internet and talk radio to shut Whites up.</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In arguments before the Supreme Court, Kagan asserted that government could ban political pamphlets&hellip;&#8221; </p>

     Well, Obama has twisted these words and is promising that if he is re-elected there will be &#8220;a chick in every car and some pot in every garage!&#8221;<br>
     To see some forbidden views inside King Barack&rsquo;s monarchy, Google &#8220;Obama Supports Public Depravity&#8221; and also Google &#8220;Obama&hellip;destined to become a black-slavery avenger.&#8221;</p>
