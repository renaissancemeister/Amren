<h1>William and Mary Professor Thinks He Found Oldest Black School</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Diverse Education, July 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A College of William and Mary professor thinks he may have found the nation&rsquo;s oldest surviving schoolhouse for African-American children.</p>
<p>English professor Terry Meyers believes the college  &mdash;  at Benjamin Franklin&rsquo;s urging  &mdash;  was instrumental in opening the Williamsburg Bray School in 1760 to educate both free and enslaved Blacks.</p>
<p>The find would be remarkable not only for its historical significance, but for its location in the political and ideological epicenter of slavery. The college itself was funded by taxes on tobacco harvested by slaves. The college, its faculty and even some students owned slaves, and slave labor built core campus buildings, maintained the grounds and fed the residents.</p>
<p>It also runs counter to later sentiments in Virginia and other Southern states, which explicitly forbade teaching slaves to read or write. An 1819 Virginia law made doing so punishable by 20 lashes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Franklin, the future Founding Father, had proposed Williamsburg as one of three Colonial sites for the &#8220;Instruction of Negro Children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Records show the Bray School endured until the death of the schoolmistress, Anne Wager, in 1774. Wager taught as many as 30 students at a time, mostly slaves, including two, Adam and Fanny, who were owned by the college.</p>
<p>The children were taught to read and write, and the girls to knit and sew. School rules instructed Wager to lead the students &#8220;in a decent &amp; orderly Manner to Church.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although Meyers has no proof the building is the old schoolhouse, historians support his claims.</p>
<p>Meyers would like to see the ground excavated at the original Digges address. Historians agree that some testing should be done to determine the age of the structure.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s impressive was that the people who created this school believed that African Americans had immortal souls, just like White people,&#8221;&rsquo; Engs [Robert Engs, a retired University of Pennsylvania historian] said, &#8220;and that they needed salvation.&#8221;</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s right  &mdash;  make it sound like hardly any white folks, especially in the South, thought blacks were human and had souls!  Many masters encouraged slaves to become Christians and attend church, either to save their souls or to try to civilize them.  Many white churches allowed blacks to sit in  special balconies, and, after emancipation, communities almost always allowed the black folks to peacefully worship in their own churches.  Preachers often became politically active because blacks were able to congregate and formulate community plans in their churches.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d think the article would include important details like that, wouldn&rsquo;t you?  But in such cases, a liberal&rsquo;s word is never to be put to the test.<br>

		<p>For over 250  years, starting in 1760, whites have been attempting to educate Blacks and we still have an education gap.Surely by now we would have had an educated class of Blacks and not just a token few. </p>

		<p>The College of William and Mary English professor cited in this article is of course white (picture at the original article). Once again, whites are the ones doing the groundbreaking research (if indeed that&rsquo;s what this is), even concerning black issues, as well as the most hand-wringing over past white misdeeds.</p>

We&rsquo;re often told that blacks were forbidden to learn to read. Yet, we have writings of former slaves.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt there were such restrictions but I&rsquo;ve never read any authoritative source on the subject. All I read are comments like &#8216;blacks weren&rsquo;t allowed to learn to read&rsquo;. And yet, some did.</p>
<p>Does anyone know an objective, authoritative source that wasn&rsquo;t written by an author with an agenda?</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re forgetting about the educational institution that boasts the highest number of black graduates.  It&rsquo;s extremely popular among blacks  &mdash;   roughly one in four black Americans attend this institution at some point in their lives.</p>

		<p>I suppose this piece illustrates mainly that there were wide variations in the treatment of blacks in early America, throughout both the North and South.  There were also vast differences of opinion regarding their intellectual capabilities, though it would appear that the predominant view, in both North and South, was that blacks were in most cases intellectually inferior and emotionally child-like.  Of course, in that period it was permissable to express such opinions.</p>
<p>The article also illustrates that whatever the prevailing opinions of blacks held by whites, there were then as now whites of good will, extending themselves to improve the lot of both black slaves and freedmen.</p>
<p>Sadly, not much has come of those efforts.</p>

		<p>All I read are comments like &lsquo;blacks weren&rsquo;t allowed to learn to read&rsquo;. And yet, some did.<br>
 <br>
And if the disappointingly PC Glenn Beck can be believed, at least some of the BLACK signators of the Declaration of Independence could read and write. Personally, in all my years of study, and I do study, I have NEVER heard of any  black signators of the DoE&hellip;.any more learned people that can comment on that would be appreciated.<br>
