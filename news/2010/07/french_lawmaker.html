<h1>French Lawmakers Approve Full Veil Ban</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Clark, Agence France-Presse, July 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>French lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to ban the wearing of face-covering veils in public spaces, as Europe toughens its approach to integrating Muslim immigrant communities.</p>
<p>On the eve of Bastille Day, when France celebrates the birth of what was to become a staunchly secular republic, the 577-seat National Assembly lower house voted by 335 votes to one for a total ban.</p>
<p>The bill will now go to the Senate in September, but opponents of the ban in its proposed form worry that it will eventually be overturned by the judges of the Constitutional Council, France&rsquo;s highest legal body.</p>
<p>For, while President Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s determination to ban the niqab and the burqa won enough political support to carry it, opponents argue that it breaches French and European human rights legislation.</p>
<p>The bill defines public space very broadly, including not just government buildings and public transport, but all streets, markets and thoroughfares, private businesses and entertainment venues.</p>
<p>Just ahead of the vote, Socialist lawmaker Francois de Rugy warned that if judges overturned the law it would be a &#8220;priceless gift to the fundamentalists we all oppose&#8221; and accused the right of electoral grandstanding.</p>
<p>But Socialist and Communist deputies did not vote against the bill, they simply abstained, and it sailed through the vote without a hitch.</p>
<p>Similar laws are pending in Belgium, Spain and some Italian municipalities, but the ban is particularly sensitive in France, whose rundown city suburbs are home to Europe&rsquo;s biggest Muslim minority.</p>
<p>Last week, Justice Minister Michele Alliot-Marie told lawmakers debating the bill that its adoption would assert French values and help to better integrate Muslim communities into the national way of life.</p>
<p>She said being forced to wear the niqab or the burqa &#8220;amounts to being cut off from society and rejecting the very spirit of the French republic that is founded on a desire to live together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At a time where our societies are becoming more global and complex, the French people are pondering the future of their nation. Our responsibility is to show vigilance and reaffirm our commonly-shared values,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Critics say the law exploits a non-problem  &mdash;  only about 1,900 women among France&rsquo;s five to six million Muslims wear a veil  &mdash;  in a bid to pander to anti-immigration voters and to distract attention from France&rsquo;s economic woes.</p>
<p>Most French Muslims come from France&rsquo;s former colonies in North and West Africa, where wearing the veil is rare, rather than from the Arabian peninsula or Pakistan where niqabs and burqas are a cultural tradition.</p>
<p>Mohammed Moussaoui, the head of the French Council of the Muslim Faith, a government advisory body, supports steps to discourage women from wearing the full veil, but has said a law would unfairly stigmatise a vulnerable group.</p>
<p>Mindful that a law with a broad scope might be struck down by the European court of human rights, which protects religious freedoms, Mr. Sarkozy&rsquo;s own ruling party has asked for the text to be examined by the Constitutional Council.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the ban enjoys broad popular support. An international poll conducted in April and May by the Washington-based Pew Research Center found that more than eight in 10 French voters supported a ban.</p>
<p>The same mood prevailed in Germany, where 71% backed a ban, in Britain, with 62%, and Spain with 59%.</p>
<p>Under the bill, it would be illegal for anyone to cover their faces in public places like streets, parks, public transport or shops.</p>
<p>Fines of 150 euros (190 dollars) will be imposed on those caught wearing the veil, after a six-month grace period to allow time to educate Muslim women about the ban.</p>
<p>Men who force their wives or daughters to cover themselves for religious reasons face stiffer penalties of up to 30,000 euros and a one-year jail term.<br>

		<p>Dog and pony show, folks. Even if the commie courts don&rsquo;t overturn this law, it&rsquo;s like scolding a murderer to behave after he puts a bullet in your wife&rsquo;s head. France is awash in vile muslim extremism and insane organized, racialy motivated violence- all of it muslim/brown/black on white. Everyone knows, and nobody can or will lift a finger to stop the final death blow to France at the hands of a sub 80-IQ mob. Veil schmeil. <br>
RIP France. And they won&rsquo;t save themselves, so mourn them not!</p>
<p>I can confidently say that every founding father of the USA would heartily agree, so I have no shame. </p>

		<p>If the French courts have the final say in this I can only hope and pray that they are not as self-hating as their counterparts in neighbouring England.The French government&rsquo;s action on the Burkha could prove a defining moment for the whole of Europe.Let us hope that this brave act(It could never happen in the UK)is not scuppered by a cowardly and traitorous judiciary.</p>

		<p>In the U.S., courts are notorious for quashing the wishes of the majority  &mdash;  at times vast majority  &mdash;  of the people.  They consistently ignore the Constitution and &#8220;interpret&#8221; statutes any way they desire.  The nuttiest are those in states where same-sex marriage has been deemed a right.  It&rsquo;s dead certain that the founding fathers had no intention of anyone getting married except a man and woman, and not a single state has legislatively passed a law allowing it.  U.S. courts are often so dangerously opposed to religious and gun rights that a constitutional convention will probably be needed to rectify the situation.  As for Europe, it sounds like the EU is becoming a disaster for cultural issues.</p>

I agree with #2.  Much ado about nothing.  <br>
Fussing about veils is just a distraction  to deflect public attention while they are taking over your country. <br>
It deceives the public with the impression that something is being done.   <br>
Sheer nonsense.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re conspicuously swatting at flies, while ignoring the elephant in the room.</p>

		<p>This law makes it look like NW Muslims are not really welcome in France and Europe - it&rsquo;s could be interpreted as saying to NW Muslims that they have to change, become like French White citizens or else leave, go back where they came from&hellip;..</p>

		<p> I support the right of all citizens to dress, within the limits of community decency, as they please. With that said, the full veil ban is a political distraction/charade promoted by the conniving, disingenuous Neo-Con dwarf Sarkozy. What is really needed is a crackdown on illegal immigration, along with mass deportations, and a curtailment of all legal immigration to France from the Third World.</p>

		<p>Dog and Pony show? I guess you could look at that way&hellip;</p>
<p>But Germany has groups forming to adopt a minarette ban just like the Swiss. Imagine how those groups would go if the most tolerant, guiltless nation (in the German eyes, seriously compare it to German guilt), their NEIGHBOR were to go through with this.</p>
<p>Europe is beginning to take baby steps. First the Swiss, then the Beglians, now a big Nation needs to be on the move. Sure, this is only treating the symptoms, but have faith. Rome was not built in a day. </p>

		<p>It is going to have to be done step by step.  A law like this is the best step for gaining some traction.  Some of you think that the only way to do this is to adopt a Nazi like purge of communities with stormtroopers marching up to doors and hauling away screaming women and children.  No, it has to be done in a way that preserves as much order as possible.  Or else, a civil war in France will affect your jobs here and the economies of the world and then we will see some suffering.  That might be inevitable, but it is not what any sane person would want.  What a sane person wants (I hope I am one) is to see the situation reversed by fixing the laws and settling some issues with the EU or if elsewhere, other treaties or agreements like NAFTA.  It is a big job, but it took 60 years to get here, so it might take 60 years to undo it. I just hope the momentum will grow and this law will find other laws created to enforce and uphold precedents and so the courage of native entitlement will return to Europeans. </p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe the comments that these types of good news articles generate. What is with all the pessimism on this website?  </p>
<p>Instead of spending so much time talking about how wonderful Asians are and how the Chinese will rule over us one day, and how whites are such a loser race, why don&rsquo;t all of you start focusing more on the pieces of good news such as this, that could possibly bode well for our people in the long term?  </p>
<p>Do you NOT want whites (YOUR race and MY race) to do well and come out of all of this okay?  I want to know what your agendas are, because it seems you don&rsquo;t wish to see your own people do well, which really disturbs me and makes me wonder why you are on here posting to begin with. </p>
<p>Go spend more of your time on those left-leaning &#8220;Economist&#8221; type magazines that spend most of their time bashing the West and it&rsquo;s future, as well as talking about what wonderful countries China and India are and how &#8220;it is now their century&#8221;.  </p>
<p>We can do without your opinions on here.  Sites such as this are about promoting the future of the white race.  Get lost.</p>

You state that &#8220;we can do without your opinions here&hellip;&#8221;, speaking of those of us who look cynically (God forbid!) on half-hearted half-measures taken by societies that have been on a headlong plunge into anihilation for decades.<br>
Look Courtney, optimism is a good thing, but pragmatism-and cynicism are quite appropos here: there is the absoutely CRUSHING weight of TENS OF MILLIONS of muslims from the worst places, sprawled all over Europe. There are the one-world policies of the Marxists in power, who simply mortgage off their countries, merely to remain in power for their short careers. It&rsquo;s THAT BAD.<br>
Can you even mentally picture a number as large as fifty million? I know you can&rsquo;t, because nobody really can. Now try to  picture that many muslims in Europe. Now picture a few million in the USA, and add to that number forty or so Mestizos . You can&rsquo;t, again. BUT THEY&#8221;RE HERE. And they want this place for their own. </p>
<p>Hitler almost took the soviet Union with two million soldiers (tough and dedicated though they were). Just two million.</p>
<p>And the West is wallowing in the malaise of having had a cushy, safe life for several generations, wherein saving one&rsquo;s job, or a vacation, outweighs longterm concerns, like societal survival, can you see that?  Thus, there is no &#8220;mobilization,&#8221; no framework from which to mount a defense&hellip;especially because said defense would be decried, and the defender renounced, shunned. Whites are bound hand and foot by a fear of even speaking, let alone acting to reclaim their lands. It is a war MUCH bigger than WWII, involving three times the population, yet not a shot has been fired.<br>
 This is a very dire situation. And if you had to move three or four times in your life to get away from the spreading hordes, you might realize that there aren&rsquo;t enough desireable places to move to anymore. Where you gonna&rsquo; go? Finland? Think again, black muslims are raping Finnish girls there, and beating them out of hatred. </p>
<p>Take a second look, and consider SEVERE CYNICISM as a cosmology. The rest of the world wants YOUR LUNCH. the politicians aren&rsquo;t going to safeguard it for you .<br>
WAKE UP. </p>

<p>And so sitting here on your computer bashing every bit of good news that comes through helps us?  It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the good news is on this website, it always generates so much negativity and pessimism from posters on here.  </p>
<p>If the Dutch deport 500,000 people from their country it &#8220;isn&rsquo;t enough&#8221;.  </p>
<p>If Miss Oklahoma gets up in front of millions at the Miss USA pageant and says that she supports Arizona, it generates countless comments from people bashing white women because she also said that she is against racial profiling. I guess the fact that she was on TV and that she could get fired from a job never crosses anyone&rsquo;s mind.  Perhaps we should be thankful that she said what she said at all?</p>
<p>If Obama starts losing support among white women in college, people on here waste time getting upset over that fact that &#8220;30% of whites view him favorably&#8221; !!!!!!!  Has it ever occurred to you that many polls are liberally biased to begin with?</p>
<p>Nothing is ever good enough.  It makes me wonder what will ever be good enough.</p>
<p>Think about these things long term.  What will this veil ban lead to for instance?  It could cause Muslims to riot which will in turn wake up thousands more French people!</p>
<p>Stop looking at what the LEADERS in the Western world are doing, what the media is reporting, what polls say, what a white person shies away from saying on public television for fear of losing their job etc&hellip;..!  Start looking long term and at underlying trends!  Do you have so little faith in your people?</p>

		<p>Courney, when you put it that way, it makes more sense, and I&rsquo;ll agree with you that good things ARE happening.<br>
But I see evry street getting browner, more hostile to whites. I see every city, country and institution continuing it;ds hateful assault against us (and I never wanted to hurt or offend a brown person in my life).<br>
It&rsquo;s just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, as they say.<br>
 I am by nature a moderate guy, well educated, and from a fairly cosmoplolitan family. I don&rsquo;t fit the demographic of aome &#8220;hater.&#8221;  Still, I hate to say it, but I talk to my people every day. Mostly there is cowardice and sloth. Often there is a scorn or even hatred for our heritage and what we are.<br>
Euros and Americans are at least 50% brainwashed and diving gleefully into the abyss.<br>
