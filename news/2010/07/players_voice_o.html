<h1><a href="https://ca.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCATRE66C5CP20100713?sp=true">Players Voice Opposition to Arizona Immigration Law</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gene Cherry, Reuters, July 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An increasing number of major leaguers are expressing their opposition to Arizona&rsquo;s controversial immigration law and some are calling for the 2011 All-Star Game to be moved from Phoenix.</p>
<p>&#8220;It (the law) reminds me of seeing the old movies with the Nazis when they ask you to show your papers,&#8221; San Diego Padres infielder Jerry Hairston Jr. told ESPN.com. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Civil rights groups were scheduled to protest the law before Tuesday&rsquo;s All-Star Game in Anaheim.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they should move (the game), because it&rsquo;s going to be a lot of Latin players in the All-Star Game,&#8221; Venezuelan-born Padres catcher Yorvit Torrealba said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think (the law) is fair,&#8221; Torrealba added &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think anyone has the right to approach me or my family just because we&rsquo;re Latino.&#8221;</p>
<p>Padres All-Star pitcher Heath Bell said he would consider boycotting the 2011 game if it is not moved.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&rsquo;m voted (to play in the game) I&rsquo;m going to have to really think about it because I have a lot of friends that are not white,&#8221; Bell said. &#8220;Sometimes you need to stick up for your friends and family.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you going to tell me that, me being Hispanic, if you stop me and I don&rsquo;t have my ID, you&rsquo;re going to arrest me?&#8221; Pujols [St. Louis Cardinals slugger Albert Pujols] told USA Today (www.usatoday.com). &#8220;That can&rsquo;t be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, however, supports the law.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the national government doesn&rsquo;t fix your problem .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you&rsquo;ve got to fix it yourself,&#8221; he told reporters last month.<br>

		<p>What I&rsquo;m noticing is the absence of a lot of celebrities and performers flocking to the anti-Arizona cause.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the same type of celebrity who came out in support of Obama, or Clinton, or food subsidies for Africa, or the Jena Six, or whatever cause was perceived to help their image. </p>
<p>Apparently, their handlers can sense the groundswell of support for the anti-illegals law, so they have advised them not to jeopardize their careers by making public statements or appearances against Arizona.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come a long way in a short time.</p>

		<p>Honestly, with all the states and cities wanting to pass 1070-like laws, or upgrade their existing laws to 1070-like strength, there will hardly be anywhere to hold an ASG to please these kooks.  2012&rsquo;s is in Kansas City, last year&rsquo;s was in St. Louis, and by the time St. Louis hosted, MO had what was the toughest state level immigration law on the books and it was being enforced.  By the time KC has it, MO will have upgraded it to be on par with Arizona&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>Only Tony LaRussa seems to have any sense.  Of course the other players above were all non-White with the exception of Heath.</p>
<p>Heath is an interesting story.  How could he be elected to the All-Star game?  If you view his stats here -</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/376bc6l" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/376bc6l</a></p>
<p>In 7 seasons he has a LIFETIME record of 23-19.  He&rsquo;s 4-0 this year.  This is All-star material???  He appears to be a big buffoon, which by the way is typical of White men today.  Many White pitchers today, as a matter of fact, most of them, tend to be overweight, cut in the mold of Roger Clemens.  It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me at all if he was on the &#8220;juice&#8221; either.  Just a big, foolish White guy trying to do everything politically correct, rather than correct.  When are we going to see an Awakened White Man who speaks out?</p>
<p>When?</p>

		<p>It pleases me mightily to learn that major leaguers, from whatever sport, don&rsquo;t like the AZ law. If they don&rsquo;t like it, I do. These spoiled pampered babies have been ruining our nation for years. They are designed and marketed by the money cartel to distract the people from paying attention while the money boys loot the till. I never watch them. I never attend their events. I would not be caught dead in one of their stupid tee shirts or other idiotic memorabilia. </p>
<p>Bread &amp; circuses have done irreparable harm to our once wonderful nation. If I never see another sporting event again it will be too soon. We are vacationing in AZ this year. So is my sister and my brother and their families. We want to give full support to the noble and courageous people of AZ and their wonderful governor. Let the sporting boys and girls go play their games. They won&rsquo;t get any of our money. </p>

Just like the census, every 10 years, everyone in the US should be required to show proof of residency. That would remove any charge of profiling.</p>

		<p>60% of the MBL players are foreign citizens and they want to bite the hand that feeds them and has fed them for 50 yrs? <br>
Do they celebrate Jackie Robinson coming in in 1948? Was that meant for them too?</p>

		<p>Do you notice how they don&rsquo;t worry about alienating their white fans?  Yes, because they know - just like politicians do - the majority of whites are not racially aware!!!<br>

		<p>Just as the lead-in says&hellip;MLB proves that while they might at excel at hand-eye coordination, their ability to read is somewhat lacking.  None of the reasons they mention can be found in the law as it stands.  In fact what they say is actually prohibited!  </p>
<p>I would like to know what % actually read English well enough to understand&hellip;uhm&hellip;say a newspaper article?</p>
<p>Just another reason why I stopped watching the NFL, Basketball, or Baseball a very long time ago.  To know the money these people make and the lifestyles this country affords them and they have such little concern for it.  I don&rsquo;t have to pay to be insulted.  I get that for free.</p>
<p>Hockey and Nascar is where I waste my time these days, when I feel the need to watch sports.  I enjoy international soccer and rugby also, but the big 3 in America lost it for me a long time ago. </p>
