			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>D.J. Mulloy, Patterns of Prejudice, July 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
<p>The New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense has been a cause du scandale since it was formed in the early 1990s. Indeed, the Anti-Defamation League has described it as &#8216;the largest organized anti-Semitic and racist black militant group in America&rsquo;. It is somewhat surprising, then, that there has been very little detailed analysis of the party and its activities. Mulloy begins to fill this gap by outlining the origins and development of the party, and by closely examining the ongoing dispute between the New Black Panthers and surviving members of the original Black Panther Party  &mdash;  established by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale in Oakland, California in 1966  &mdash;  over the right to claim the name, the history and the legacy of the Panthers in the United States. Critically assessing the strategies and actions of the New Black Panthers, Mulloy argues that its high-profile, media-centred approach to political activism has largely been a failure with regard to its overall aim of reviving the Black Power movement in the United States.</p>

		<p>Self-defense:  That&rsquo;s the first thing I think of when I think of middle aged black men with corn rows and dreadlocks standing outside of a polling place wearing camos and armed with a rifle, yelling out drivel about black power.  It&rsquo;s also what I think of when King Shabazz implies that murdering white children is a necessary element of the cause of social justice.</p>

		<p>The original Black Panthers were nothing more than a bunch of shake down extortionists that had the veneer of communism and revolutionaries, etc.</p>
<p>This current brand is probably not a whole lot more or a whole lot less.</p>
<p>Again - - the love of the uniforms, the berets, the strutting type of marching, the love of the excessive and threatening rhetoric, the flourishes of the drum and bugle corps for grown adults [?], etc.</p>
<p>A small bunch that gets a lot of publicity that is very unwarranted.</p>

		<p>The best thing that can happen to the white community is to have groups like this get maximum publicity. The white community has been neutralized over the last 40 years through negative education, Hollywood and MSM propaganda</p>

<p>And I am so amazed and outraged that Whites, for the most part just laugh that statement off as &#8220;rhetoric&#8221;!!!!! If that statement alone does not make Whites take to the streets nothing will! KILL WHITE CHILDREN???  These blacks mean it!  Just look at the murders, assaults, beatings and rape that blacks around the world are committing against Whites! The sheeple are still fast asleep. </p>
<p>What does it take to make Whites fighting mad?</p>

		<p>Sorry, Richard, but this sort of thing has been exposed for some time now, and it&rsquo;s past time to admit that nothing will shake most whites out of their stupor.  If I thought that &#8220;worse is better&#8221; would work, I would wholeheartedly endorse it.  Most of white America is going to wake up November 3 and wonder what happened, and why their candidates were defeated, and then pin their hopes on the next mythical election, which will never occur.</p>

		<p>I hope they keep it up, right along with the community organizer and the corrupt, anti-white, racist A.G. dreg who is involved in an anti-white decision frequently.</p>
<p>They scream about not having parity in the US with whites and pretend it&rsquo;s not due to their low intelligence and incompetence, but to racism.</p>
<p>Most of the entire black community consists of the average Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s congregant.  </p>
<p>In the end it will be their racism and stupidity that will cause them untold grief.  And THAT will be blamed on someone else but themselves also.</p>
<p>I have less respect for blacks than any other race on earth.  They haven&rsquo;t contributed one single iota of benefit to mankind, so they try to steal other people&rsquo;s culture and history.</p>

		<p>We already did give them their own country, Louis Ferdinand.  It&rsquo;s called &#8220;Liberia&#8221;.</p>
<p>The deal we&rsquo;re being offered is that they want half of what we have, and when they&rsquo;ve used that up or destroyed it, they&rsquo;ll come back for half of what was left.  Repeat as necessary.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before; if every white person on earth moved to the moon, the diversitoids would follow us - if that were possible - and within a generation they would be claiming that they built the moon and that it was &#8220;theirs&#8221;.</p>
