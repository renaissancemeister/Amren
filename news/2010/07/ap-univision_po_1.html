<h1>AP-Univision Poll: US Hispanics Mix Hopes, Strains</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alan Fram and Christine Amario, Google News, July 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hispanics are eager to blend into American society while still maintaining their cultural identity, a paradox that reflects the complex beliefs of the nation&rsquo;s fastest-growing minority. Yet there are limits to assimilation  &mdash;  most don&rsquo;t expect the United States to elect a Latino president in the next 20 years.</p>
<p>An Associated Press-Univision poll of more than 1,500 Latinos uncovered several distinct trends. Hispanics worry more than most Americans about losing jobs and paying bills. They place a high importance on education and expect their children to go to college.</p>
<p>The poll, also sponsored by The Nielsen Company and Stanford University, showed that Hispanics are torn between hopes for tomorrow and daily doses of financial stress.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The recession that erased millions of jobs has taken an especially heavy toll on Latinos, whose average income is lower than many other groups. And the Hispanic community has been jolted by election-season debate over the country&rsquo;s estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, a debate that has increased in intensity following Arizona&rsquo;s enactment of a law that requires police, while enforcing other laws, to question a person&rsquo;s immigration status if officers have a reasonable suspicion he or she is in the country illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Just over half in the survey, 54 percent, say it is important that they change to assimilate into society, yet about two-thirds, 66 percent, say Latinos should maintain their distinct culture.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among Hispanics, there are significant differences between those born here and immigrants, who tend to have rosier views of their new country. Similar schisms are evident between citizens and non-citizens, and between those who mostly speak English or Spanish with their families.</p>
<p>Those from abroad are likelier than U.S.-born Latinos to expect their children to attend college and to have better lifestyles than they do. Yet reflecting their lesser integration into American society, 76 percent of immigrants say their well-being depends on other Hispanics succeeding  &mdash;  about double the number of American-born Latinos who say so. Those from abroad are likelier to express financial worries, to say it&rsquo;s important to blend into society, and to say at least half their friends are other Hispanics.</p>

<p>I think the Chicano/Hispanic dropout rate is even higher than the same for blacks, in spite of it not being that hard to earn a high school diploma in heavily Hispanic schools, or even in schools that aren&rsquo;t majority Hispanic, but have teachers and administrators that pander to them all the live long day.  If that&rsquo;s &#8220;placing a high importance on education,&#8221; how much worse would it be if they didn&rsquo;t place a high importance on education?</p>
<p>Of course, anyone can say anything to a pollster.</p>

The  reason Hispanics are unable to assimilate into american society is because so many are of a mixed race backround. If you ask any black person from the Dominican republic or panama they would hate you if you called them black. The fact is Puerto Rico has been pert of the united states for 100 years yet only 25%  speak english. had they been white they would be the 51 state by now.</p>

<p>How much longer are we going to accept these lies? </p>
<p>1. If &#8220;hispanics&#8221;(which they are not) suffer more to job loss because their wages are lower, then they should have more success in finding these lower paying jobs, don&rsquo;t you think? It is ten times harder for Whites to find jobs even those with a college education, at a salary which they worked hard for. Low paying jobs are the ones in demand since our government has outsourced most of them to Mexico and India and China, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>2. Now it&rsquo;s 11 million illegals? What happened to the fake number of 12 million? After all these years of illegals POURING across our borders don&rsquo;t you think they would have the smarts to raise that number to at least 40 million illegals?</p>

		<p>Why can&rsquo;t Hispanics blend into American society and keep their cultural identity at the same time?  People from scores of different countries, including Latin-American ones, have been doing just that for over 200 years.  I personally have ancestors from seven European nations, yet my cultural identity is Southern hillbilly, which is rooted in the Celtic culture.  And I believe that I&rsquo;ve assimilated quite properly into mainstream American society. <br>
Of course, many illegals don&rsquo;t want to be Americans  &mdash;  period.  They don&rsquo;t want the responsibility of being English-speaking, tax-paying, law-abiding citizens.  They just want to feast at the trough, send funds back to the motherland, and eventually return.  They will not avail themselves of any &#8220;path to citizenship&#8221;, and politicians know it.  </p>

		<p>Au Contraire olewhitelady!  If given amnesty they WILL avail themselves of the responsibility of Americans at least ONCE every four years at November election time.<br>
The rest of the time during those four years it will be business as usual - avoiding taxes by working off the books, acting as drug mules, bringing in more illegals (their extended families), making full use of all the public services while still not paying taxes (working under the table).  But at least once every four years, they WILL VOTE to keep things in their favor, and keep the Liberal betrayers in power.  Which IS the whole point as far as the Liberals and Neo-Cons are concerned.</p>

		<p>Well of course! They want the perks of Americans without the responsibilites. They expect their children to go to college? On American money.  54 % say it&rsquo;s important for the to assimilate? Firstly, their view of &#8216;assimliation&rsquo; is hardly ours. Second, the majority of them are being, shall we say, untruthful.</p>

		<p>I can speak with a tremendous amount of authority on this issue as I work in an urban high school that is currently 100% &#8216;latino.&rsquo;  Here is what I have observed over four years:</p>
<p>1.  There is no &#8216;latino&rsquo; unity.  Dominicans sit with Dominicans, Mexicans with Mexicans, Puerto Ricans with their own, etc. and they all look down on each other through the prism of national rivalry.  Lighter skinned ones of every national background look down on the more indian/black/mestizo ones as well.  The racism among &#8216;latinos&rsquo; would make a k-k-k member blush.</p>
<p>2.  95% of Dominicans are similar to African Americans.  They have a form of broken &#8216;ghetto&rsquo; Spanish that is like ebonics in Spanish.  Other Spanish speakers cannot understand them half the time, and they listen to a kind of crude rap music called reggaton, when they&rsquo;re not listening to hard core rap in English.  Reggaton is so mind-numbing as to not be believed.  5% of the Dominicans are good people while about 40% are straight-up gangbangers.  (This is my observation after years of close contact.)</p>
<p>3.  There are three types of Mexican students.  #1 The bright and nice ones (about 10%).  The nice but &#8216;dumb-as-a-doorknob&rsquo; ones (about 60%).  Finally the 30% who are gangbangers or wanna-be&rsquo;s, and who are very sadistic in their values.</p>
<p>4.  South American students are mostly nice.  The more Indian they are, the less likely they are able to function in a modern educational system (probably due to coming from non-literate societies).  The whiter they are, the smarter they are, probably due to special advantages as a legacy of Spanish colonialism.  I will concede these social justice injustices.</p>
<p>5.  Central American students are 50% nice and 50% gangbanger depending on the level of whiteness and specific country.  I am in utter shock at meeting &#8216;students&rsquo; from Nicaragua who wear their pants around their knees telling me that in their countries all the boys in the city do like that (and listen to spanish rap, etc.)  I&rsquo;ve met students from Columbia, Argentina and Chile who were first world in their outlook.  Salvadorans are either totally nice (20%) or total MS-13, &#8216;cut-off-your-head&rsquo; gangbangers.  I&rsquo;ve not seen any middle ground.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that there&rsquo;s so many differences among &#8216;latinos&rsquo; but most of us gringos are just in the dark about it.  If we knew more about the vast differences in their cultural orientations, we could adopt certain white latinos into our culture while knowing which ones to keep out of the country.  I would accept educated mexicans, columbians, costa ricans, argentinians, chileans, lighter skinned ecuadoreans (who are almost all very sweet people) and some others like white brazilians, etc.  Those are the ones who want to assimilate and join us.  We could drive  wedge in the &#8216;latino&rsquo; &#8216;movement&rsquo; by treating it with knowledge and realism.  White &#8216;latinos&rsquo; and those who are nearly white have no respect for the more indian/african among them and are eager to gain acceptance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the more mestizo or indian mexicans who run around supporting azatlan and la raza.  It&rsquo;s the more african dominicans who are gangbanging.  It&rsquo;s the indians of central america who are running the worst gangs, etc&hellip;  You get the idea.</p>
<p>This article above used a poll to guage latino interest in colleges for example.  No one unless they&rsquo;re really stupid is going to say on the phone that no, they do not want to send their kids to college.</p>
<p>In my experience, 1/3 of the latino students I have want to go to college and many do qualify in terms of intelligence, but many don&rsquo;t have citizenship.  Another third say they want college but they are wholly unqualified for it.  A final third say they don&rsquo;t want to go to college and they literally have dreams of working for Target or the corner bodega.  I am not kidding.</p>

<p>Can I ask you a question? </p>
<p>Every post you seem to side with nonwhites, such as this comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&rsquo;t Hispanics blend into American society and keep their cultural identity at the same time?&#8221; </p>
<p>No, &#8220;hispanics&#8221; do not blend into American society. They may fool you but not me. They can act &#8220;American&#8221; say the right things, but they will always side with their own racial group. I have seen it way too many times.</p>
<p>No one here is talking about EUROPEANS forming a &#8220;one out of many&#8221;. Of course they will. That is the TRUE meaning of &#8220;one out of many&#8221; to begin with. They come from the SAME racial roots.<br>
 It is the blacks, mexicans, asians (different races) that won&rsquo;t/cannot ever assimilate with White European peoples in the same country. They were never meant to and we were never meant to have them here to assimilate in the first place.</p>

<p>No, thank you. I don&rsquo;t care how &#8220;nice&#8221; they are.  Maybe you would like to become another Brazil where there is so much miscegenation that they have all become one mixed bag race.</p>
<p> The problem with your ideology is that I, for one don&rsquo;t accept it. I do not want mixed races to where Whites will breed themselves out of existence. That is the whole point of WN and any sort of racial awareness. Without a White race and a White land there is absolutely no hope for this planet.</p>
<p> We want our own lands for our own peoples to live and raise WHITE children in. Is that too much to ask? </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but that is incorrect.</p>
<p>There are parts of Brazil which have been colonized mostly by Germans and Italians. The population of those areas, has not really become of the whole big Brazilian genetic melting pot.</p>
<p>In such towns, in Brazil, people don&rsquo;t look Mestizo or Indian AT ALL!</p>
<p>In fact, such parts of Brazil, are know among people working for professionnal model agencies, as places where they can find young women who have a certain kind of look, and very high potential, in high fashion industry&hellip;</p>
<p>Think of models Gisele Bundchen and Adrianna Lima, for example.<br>

Complex beliefs, eh? I&rsquo;m not really convinced&hellip;</p>
<p>Do they hold such complex beliefs, really, or are many of those people just to stupid to understand the idea that you can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it?</p>
<p>Complex beliefs&hellip; I would say there are limits, probably, to the complexity of the beliefs their brains can really handle.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be mean, but Soledad O&rsquo;Brien and Sonia Sotomayor, are supposed to be among the smartest of those Mestizo people, right&hellip;? See what I mean?</p>

		<p>European Latin Americans in US are really not &#8220;one of many&#8221;.<br>
I&rsquo;m one of them and I know a lot like me. We look like mainstream Americans so we are sort of &#8216;invisible&rsquo;. I fully agree with Jay about his idea of driving a wedge in Latino community. </p>
