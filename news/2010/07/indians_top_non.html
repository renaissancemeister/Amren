			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Economic Times (New Delhi), July 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>People from India account for the maximum number of the resident non-immigrant population in the United States, latest governmental figures have revealed.</p>
<p>Of the total number of 1.83 million resident non-immigrants in the US in the year 2008, as many as 400,000 were from India, followed by 150,000 from Canada and 140,000 from South Korea, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said.</p>
<p>Slightly more than half (53 per cent) of resident non-immigrant were citizens of Asian countries, including India (22 per cent), South Korea (8 per cent), China (7 per cent), Japan (6 per cent), and Taiwan (2 per cent), DHS said in its report based on the figures available till September 2008.</p>
<p>Europe and North America comprised another 17 per cent each, lead by Canada (8 per cent) and Mexico (7 per cent). The five leading countries accounted for over 50 per cent of the total, it said.</p>
<p>The resident non-immigrant population includes temporary workers, students, exchange visitors and diplomats, who were legally admitted for specific and temporary purposes with long stays.</p>
<p>Continent-wise Asia tops the list with 970,000, followed by Europe (320,000), North America (310,000) and South America (100,000).</p>
<p>Temporary workers and families accounted for majority with 51 per cent (930,000), followed by students and families (590,000), exchange visitors and families (240,000) and diplomats, other representatives and families (70,000).</p>
<p>California has the maximum number of resident non-immigrants among all the States at 280,000; followed by New York 210,000 and Texas 140,000.</p>
<p>Those in the age group of 25-34 constituted 710,000. The 18-24 age group came second with 470,000, followed by the 35-44 group with 290,000, under 18 with 190,000, 45-54 with 120,000 and 55 and older with 50,000.<br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t all these places have booming economies and jobs for everyone? Japan at 6 per cent really surprises me. I cannot see anyone from Japan coming to the U.S. What would be the attraction for them? They live in a prosperous, safe place, and they thrown it all away for what exactly?</p>

		<p>There are over 1 billion of them, every day they produce more than 1 million of them, wait untill they are the majority everywhere. <br>
I just can&rsquo;t stand watching this. When I was young I felt sorry for Indians, blacks and other non-whites, now I feel sorry for my sister&rsquo;s white children, who will grow up in this mess. What kind of future do the white children have? Very, very pessimistic one&hellip;</p>

		<p>They may be &#8216;non-immigrant&rsquo; residents for now, but if Australia and Canada are taken as examples, many will want to stay.</p>
<p>Once they put down roots, the chain migration of family members begins. </p>
<p>Indians can double and triple their population in a few short years, driving others out of the neighborhoods they take over.</p>

		<p>In my experience, at least Indians make much better than neighbors than say, ahem, some other groups.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to worry about our daughters going after them either, due to their slight stature.</p>
<p>Ah, but in the end, I believe America is full up and we need to turn off immigration for a few decades to assimilate what we got (while rooting out the 25 million illegals and tossing them out).</p>

		<p>Yes, times are a changing - and quickly at that. Living in the Bay Area, I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t have any children to worry about. Eventually whites will be under the thumb of these ethnic groups - and you all know where that leads. </p>
<p>Asians, blacks, hispanics all have in common &#8220;one enemy&#8221; that they focuses on - the whites. They may smile at your face, but they really resent us. Ethnic groups are sensitive about their cultures because they know it&rsquo;s a &#8220;don&rsquo;t go there&#8221; area for whites.</p>
<p>The future -  millions more will be coming in. Whites will become second class citizens. Also, look who&rsquo;s in power now.</p>

<p>Obviously written by someone with limited experience around Asians.  Many of the Sikhs I&rsquo;ve met have been tall men around 6 foot. Same with Hindus. Asians with improved diets grow to normal stature within a generation, Chinese and Japanese included.</p>
<p>As for white women, they will be attracted by status regardless of color, but only in the absence of racial awareness, and in an environment where they&rsquo;ve been taught &#8220;all races will one day be brown&#8221;.</p>

		<p>In my area, in the Northwest, there are a tremendous number of Indians.  They just seem to sprout out of nowhere.  Recently I was strolling with my daughter and mentioned that fact.  Just then, an Indian family seemed to appear out of nowhere right in front of us.  I&rsquo;m beginning to think there is a secret tunnel that passes directly through the Earth from India to Oregon.  I think the opening is inside a nearby mall.</p>
<p>As Jay wrote above, they do tend to make good neighbors.  Most of them appear to act just like whites.  However, more recently I noticed some trashy ones.  I expect many more of those over time.</p>

		<p>My husband went on a job interview in up town Charlotte several months ago, and he swears he was the only white guy as far as the eye could see. What really makes my blood boil is that they are taking jobs WE need. My husband works in the IT field, and they (Indians) certainly seem to have that market cornered. Don&rsquo;t tell me they can&rsquo;t find qualified Americans to do those jobs, because after the company my husband worked for, for 17 years was bought out and moved away, there were 80 or more IT workers left jobless who are MORE than qualified.</p>
<p>It worked out for the best anyway. He found a job, and he said he wasn&rsquo;t sure he could work for those people anyway considering he couldn&rsquo;t understand a word they said.</p>

		<p>Mass subcom immigration appears to be something new to the USA - it just didn&rsquo;t figure 10 to 20 years ago.<br>
 Britain, however is familiar with massive subcon immigration, and Americans would do well to heed the tale.Americans can and will expect an overwhelming wave of of mass immigration to overshadow anything previously experienced.</p>
<p>         Mark my words.I am not writing this just to shock or frighten.</p>
<p>As a ball-park figure subcon immigration, in the coming decades, will prove to be 100x as great as Mexican immigration (India has 10x the population and 10x less wealth per capita than Mexico).<br>
 Also, subcons can be relied upon to get round any big fat dumb White &#8216;immigration official&rsquo; by guile and subterfuge.They WILL invite other their aged parents other to live off taxpayers&rsquo; money.They WILL bring over every single friend, relative etc down to the last nth degree.Once on US soil they WILL reproduce markedly.<br>
 <br>
You have been warned.America, I pity you, your fate has been sealed as surely as that of a condemned prisoner.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t forget all the Indian doctors that are practicing over here, taking away jobs that should be going to US citizens that have spent all that money going through med school.  That&rsquo;s a real slap in the face.</p>
<p>One blatantly told my mother that her daughter was coming over here to learn to be a pediatrician.  She then stated that when they made enough money they would return to India to, in effect, enjoy their wealth.</p>
<p>At least she was being honest.</p>

		<p>My neighbors here in Texas are almost all Han Chinese and Indians and Pakistanis.  Jay, you may find they make &#8220;good neighbors&#8221; but I must disagree.  Remember, even Putnam was forced to conclude that increased &#8220;diversity&#8221; equaled less trust and civic involvement.  As far as whites not marrying them, you&rsquo;re wrong again.  Given constant media and public pressure on white girls to hook up with minority guys, and all the blacks/browns/yellows finding white women far more attractive than their own, I&rsquo;m seeing increasing numbers of these couples.  Usually, it&rsquo;s white guys with Asian girls, but lots more Indian guys (usually really dark-skinned ones) with blondes.  And if you really think that an America filled with supposedly high-IQ Han Chinese and Indians will be a good place to live, hey, enjoy yourself.  I weep for my sons&rsquo; futures.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to hear that, because in Australia Indian immigration has exploded recently too. I was talking to some friends recently, and we all agreed, &#8220;where did they come from so suddenly?&#8221; In my neighbourhood alone they have moved in all over the place. It&rsquo;s down to about 1/2 Whites, 1/4 Han Chinese, and the Indians now make up the majority of the remaining 1/4. I for one really don&rsquo;t like where this is going!</p>

		<p>To poster #12, thanks for the comment.  It&rsquo;s not that I said they are good neighbors in and of themselves, it&rsquo;s that they are better neighbors than blacks or Latinos.  If I had to choose between the two groups, and these choices are being forced on us in ever increasing areas, then at least Asians are generally better, albeit middle class ones.</p>
<p>I also recognize the loss of community trust in a &#8216;diverse&rsquo; neighborhood.  I live in a neighborhood that is almost all Asian now, whereas 15 years ago it was all white or Jewish.  Nearly all my neighbors are Asians now of one kind or another.  </p>
<p>While they&rsquo;re all nice and lead a middle class lifestyle, there is absolutely zero community feeling here.  (I am now one of three white houses that remain on this long block, and one of those is a weird old Irish couple who are as mean as can be.)</p>
<p>To the posters who have mentioned that they&rsquo;re seeing more and more white girls with Indians, I&rsquo;m in NY and there are Indians everywhere and I&rsquo;ve only seen/know of one such couple (and yes, the guy is very dark, bald and looks like a villain from that old Indiana Jones Temple of Doom flick).</p>
<p>Other than that, most Indians out here are recent immigrants and have not had the benefit of a high protein diet to make them tall.  Perhaps CA is different with longer established Indian enclaves.  (The Sikhs out here, by the way, stay in a world unto themselves.)</p>

		<p>  Why in the world is it necessary for the United States to absorb India&rsquo;s surplus population? India&rsquo;s population continues to increase and will soon overtake China as the world&rsquo;s most populous country. Evidently, the Indian elites have decided to export their surplus population, rather than resort to birth control campaigns that peaked under Rajiv Gandhi. In an era of declining employment and resources, does American or Europe really need India&rsquo;s millions?</p>

		<p>Jay, what part of NYC do you live in? I live in Brooklyn and I see more Paki/Indian/Bengali men with women than with blacks, they are disgusting looking and the women are all thin, attactive and of model calabar.

		<p>To jewamongyou:</p>
<p>A friend of mine in Oregon reports that the local real-estate people say:  once a house or apartment is rented to South Asians, it forevermore can be rented only to South Asians.  Why  &mdash;  the curry smell permeates the kitchen so deeply that nothing can get it out, and only other South Asians can tolerate it.   I&rsquo;ve had Indian housemates, and realized too late that we should have put plastic or other temporary covering on the kitchen walls.  Between the spice scent and yellow turmeric stains, it&rsquo;s been miraculous that no landlord charged any damages.  (I tried Simple Green and numerous other cleaners, both gritty and not; nothing worked.)</p>
<p>To NBJ:</p>
<p>quote from one of aforementioned Indian housemates:<br>
&#8220;The way women write code [computer programs] makes me want to vomit.&#8221; </p>
<p>(I&rsquo;ve had some disastrous experiences with Indian software-industry people which I won&rsquo;t describe here.  Then again, Indians in theoretical computer science  &mdash;  whole better class of human  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ve found wonderful.)<br>

		<p>Somehow I just can&rsquo;t get myself worked up over Asian immigrants, the great majority of whom are here legally, are self-supporting and law-abiding. One could argue persuasively that they&rsquo;re the only thing keeping the national IQ at around 100.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;m extremely concerned about Hispanic illegal immigration, which is threating to overwhelm our schools, our economy, and our very cultural foundations. And we&rsquo;re all concerned (and rightly so) about an eighty percent illegimacy rate among blacks and their culture of crime, violence, indolence, and the destruction of all areas they inhabit in sufficient numbers.</p>
<p>Asians are the very least of our worries.</p>

I&rsquo;ve personally be on the receiving end of such unwanted attention.</p>
<p>Back in the 90s I was in a hospital, and a fellow patient was an Indian man who was married with a toddler son.  He was extremely friendly towards me&hellip;and when my husband visited, he pointed out that the guy was flirting with me (keep in mind that my husband had actually been my first &#8220;real&#8221; boyfriend and I was still rather naive).</p>
<p>After that, I became a bit more observant, and noticed that the guy would sulk when he saw my husband.  I was not interested in him; I&rsquo;m actually a friendly woman.</p>

<p>I bet the residents of Brampton,Ontario thought the same thing when Indians first started moving in. The place is now a complete hellhole.</p>
<p>They are still a competing ethnic group who have no moral qualms about screwing whites over(ask some white IT workers who were displaced by Indian HIB drones). They also have no problem with overcrowding areas and turning them into mini Calcuttas, with all the dirt and squalor that comes with it.</p>

<p>The Indians of Brampton saw a lucrative opportunity in long-haul trucking.  </p>
<p>Because they are a closed community with a unique language and international connections, they soon began supplementing their income by smuggling.  In turn, this lead to deals gone bad and murder by competing factions.</p>

		<p>John and Jay apparerntly believe that its ok to race-replace Native Born White Americans with predatory Hindus-and predatory they are-because they have the right IQ. Well, its not. Go to an American town were the Native Born White Americans have been race-replaced by Indians. The town is effectively part of India. The resources of the town are devoted to the Hindu geneline&hellip;not to the geneline of Native Born Whie American population. Native Born White Americans are foreigner in these towns-racial foreigners that is.</p>
<p>John an Jay if you want to live among Hindus and Sikhs, pack up and go live in India. Don&rsquo;t impose India on the rest of us. You two could care less about the enormous economic terror that Hindus have inflicted upon inocent Native Born White familes-thousands of them across America. I come from one of these Natve Born White American families. </p>
<p>American Renassaince is a White Nationalist web site that strongly opposes the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Asians immigrants are as much of a threat to Native Born White Americans as Hispanic are. They can be made into a much bigger threat than Hispanic immigants by  increasing the scale of Hindu legal immigrants coming into America.</p>
<p>This is the reason why I stay away from the race and IQ stuff. It always seems to lead to mindset that is enthusiastic about replacing Native Born White Americans with Hindus street by street,town by town,city by city and state by with Hindus.</p>

		<p>I agree with Jupiter. But I would like to bring up two more points that Jupiter doesn&rsquo;t even bring up.</p>
<p>Point 1:  Indians as a whole don&rsquo;t even have high IQs to begin with. Some of them do, but not overall.  How do we know that the wives, brothers, cousins, and children that are being brought with them are just as high-IQed as the select cream of the crop Indian IT workers?</p>
<p>Point 2:  We don&rsquo;t even need Asians here.  Where were the Asians when the Greeks did everything they did, when the Europeans of the Middle Ages were building Gothic architecture, the Renaissance Europeans did everything they did, and every white nation ever since has done everything it has done?  </p>
<p>Did they get us to the moon?  Were they there with the Wright brothers?  Were they there when the first whites traveled to the depths of the oceans in submersibles?  Were they there when DNA was discovered and mapped?  Were they sitting in Thomas Edison&rsquo;s laboratory with him?  Were they with Columbus, navigating his ship for him?</p>
<p>Need I go on?  Sometimes I don&rsquo;t understand where some of the white people on this website are coming from.  Start focusing on what we need to do for our own people.  You are part of the problem.</p>
