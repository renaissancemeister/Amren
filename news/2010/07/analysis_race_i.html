			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patricia Zengerle, Reuters, July 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Many supporters of Barack Obama hoped his election as America&rsquo;s first black president might herald an era of post-racial politics, but race has been an issue his administration just can&rsquo;t seem to avoid.</p>
<p>Division and tension between black and white Americans has cropped up repeatedly over Obama&rsquo;s 18 months in office, hurting his popularity and distracting from his political agenda.</p>
<p>The issue surfaced this week when the Agriculture Department pushed a black official to resign after allegations she discriminated against a white farmer, only to apologize a day later for acting too quickly and without the facts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last July  &mdash;  in the heat of the White House fight for its healthcare overhaul  &mdash;  when Obama was subjected to scathing criticism for saying police had &#8220;acted stupidly&#8221; when they arrested Harvard University scholar Henry Louis Gates, who is black, on charges he was breaking into his own home.</p>
<p>More recently, the Justice Department dismissed voter intimidation charges against the New Black Panther Party, prompting criticism from conservative groups who said the black president was unwilling to prosecute fellow blacks for civil rights violations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS</p>
<p>It has been more than 40 years since landmark U.S. civil rights laws banned discrimination against blacks. But race in America remains a forceful, divisive factor in areas from jobs to educational opportunity to banking and home ownership.</p>
<p>Blacks account for 13 percent of the U.S. population and on average earn less and are more likely to be unemployed than other racial groups. They are also more likely to be arrested and are given harsher sentences.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Both the right and left accuse each other of injecting race into the political discourse. Experts say that&rsquo;s inevitable given Obama&rsquo;s position as the first non-white U.S. president. {snip}</p>
<p>This week, Shirley Sherrod, a black official at the Agriculture Department, said her bosses pushed her to quit after conservative media repeatedly broadcast a tape that seemed to show her saying she had discriminated against a white farmer because of his race.</p>

<p> The article itself is typical liberal deception: &#8220;Blacks account for 13 percent of the U.S. population and on average earn less and are more likely to be unemployed than other racial groups. They are also more likely to be arrested and are given harsher sentences&#8221; <br>
Of course everyone knows that Blacks are far more violent and crime-prone than Whites. Even liberals will not live around them! </p>

<p>This a joke, right?  The implication is that the OBongo administration actually <i>wants</i> to avoid the issue of race.  In actual fact, it has been flagrantly anti-White from the very beginning, and it&rsquo;s only getting worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;America&rsquo;s first black president&#8221; has been the disaster that us Wicked Racists predicted it would be from the beginning.  The left knows this, and can&rsquo;t stop trying to put up a smokescreen that will obscure it from the masses.  </p>
<p>Hint to the governmedia: it isn&rsquo;t working any more.<br>

<p>Nor will his luck change going forward IF the public learns that his two major legislative &#8220;achievements&#8221;   &mdash;  - healthcare reform and financial services reform   &mdash;  - are BOTH loaded with racial preferences:</p>
<p>1) Source (on healthcare reform): &#8220;Legislating Discrimination,&#8221; By Hans A. von Spakovsky, NATIONAL REVIEW, December 22, 2009:<br>
https://tinyurl.com/yhtw9c6</p>
<p>Effects on hiring:  &#8220;Democrats&rsquo; health-care legislation will force medical institutions to hire based on race and sex, not qualifications&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Rationale: The &#8220;bill reflects two articles of faith prevalent on the left: (1) that discrimination is perfectly acceptable when practiced in favor of certain minority groups; and (2) that racial disparities in health outcomes arise because doctors and patients don&rsquo;t have the same racial or ethnic or cultural background.&#8221; </p>
<p>2) Source (on the financial reform bill): &#8220;Racial, Gender Quotas in the Financial Bill?&#8221; By Diana Furchtgott-Roth, REAL CLEAR MARKETS, July 8, 2010:<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/2aot86d" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2aot86d</a> </p>
<p>Section 342 of the financial reform bill will establish 20 new Offices of Women and Minority Inclusion to monitor diversity in the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Securities Exchange Commission, Federal Housing Finance Agency, and other finance-related agencies. </p>
<p>This is &#8220;certain to increase inefficiency in federal agencies. To comply, federal agencies are likely to find it easier to employ and contract with less-qualified women and minorities, merely in order to avoid regulatory trouble.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Honestly, I have never heard so much talk about race, racial politics and &#8216;protected minorities&rsquo; than since obama was elected.  Before Obama race wasn&rsquo;t as big an issue.</p>
<p>I am actually quite tired of all this race talk because as Jared Taylor pointed out many times, people prefer to congregate around others of their own race and forced integration is a delusional fantasy.</p>
<p>Do I have good relations with people of other races?  Yes.  Do I feel as comfortable around them as my own kind, not usually.  The minorities that make me feel at ease are the ones who share similar values to me, and they are not the majority.</p>
<p>All the integration in the world is not going to make me like or respect the gangsta rap lifestyle.  I will never accept pants falling down or a disdain for reading and learning.  I do not want my sons to marry hoochie mommas (or salsa madres) or to even be near them to be tempted by their low class ways.</p>
<p>You can flood my neighborhood with blacks if you like (currently asians are flooding in) and it won&rsquo;t build a &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; community of people singing koombaya.  </p>
<p>My neighborhood is currently &#8216;Bowling Alone.&rsquo;  No one talks to each other or trusts each other at all.  Even the asians don&rsquo;t talk to each other because they&rsquo;re from so many different backgrounds.  (Contrast this to where I grew up where everyone either knew each other or was at least nice to each other.)</p>
<p>The diversity promoters think that the adults are hopeless, so they pin their fantasies on the school children integrating seamlessly into some kind of &#8216;new citizen of the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Well, in public schools across the nation (and in my local area) the latinos, asians and blacks do not mix amongst themselves at all.  (Self-segregation)  </p>
<p>All three groups want to and will mix with whites, because whites are seen as the safe, neutral option, but again, in schools across the nation, whites are dwindling down into a tiny minority and then disappearing, leaving behind three racial groups that do not get along and do not integrate.</p>
<p>The social justice, diversity crowd makes little effort to get these groups to integrate, let alone FORCING them to do so by law as they make whites do.</p>

		<p>Another massive lie. Obama&rsquo;s supporters right from the get go made the election about race-openly. Barack Obama was the face of race-replacement. Chris &#8220;a thrill up my leg&#8221; Matthews made the election a referendum on White Americans. If you didn&rsquo;t vote for a manfestly highly racialized foreigner from Kenyan, you are a hardcore racist.</p>
<p>On the night the foreigner from Kenya was elected president of the United States, mulitmillionaire Latina Soledade O&rsquo;Brian-married to an investment banker- announced on National TV that White Males were history.</p>
<p>The election of the foreigner from Kenyan was a signal to his highly racialized supporters to begin the merciless taunting of Native Born White American Males. Of course, they didn&rsquo;t take into account the possibility that White Males would fight back.</p>
<p>Barack Obama and his supporters are demanding that Native Born White Americans commit racial suicide. Native Born White Americans are under no obligation to do this. Barack Obama is a racist and so are his nonwhite supporters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gotta get beyond this black versus white issue and move to a place where we can all work together,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was hoping we had gotten beyond a lot of that stuff. But this is telling me that it just got swept under the rug and we have not dealt with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Okay, Shirley, let&rsquo;s start by getting beyond the Black Congressional Caucus and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and Affirmative Action and Diversity Race Privilege.</p>
<p>When we hear you denounce those racially divisive causes, then we might listen to what you have to say on race.</p>
<p>Please, don&rsquo;t denounce them.  The White Community uses them as teachables to show our people what blacks really want- privilege without effort or merit.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The issue surfaced this week when the Agriculture Department pushed a black official to resign after allegations she discriminated against a white farmer, only to apologize a day later for acting too quickly and without the facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>That buffoon who ineptly tried to spin a story about how she did a 180 regarding her racist attitude, displayed the racist attitude she has right now in describing how the poor white farmer went into detail with his explanation to her, because he thought he was superior and she was aware of it, and she made it clear she still holds that view.  Obviously, the guy was just trying to explain himself adequately to her and because she&rsquo;s dim-witted she thought his explanation was for the purpose of putting her down.  Besides revealing her bias against whites, she revealed a condition of paranoia which is quite common among blacks, right along with arrogance.</p>
<p>Keep in mind while she was relating the first part of her story the black NAACP audience was cheering her whenever she denigrated whites, just as Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s congregation did when he did the same.  This is important to note because the NAACP insists the Tea Party get the racists out of their ranks too stupid to realize that their display of racism is rife within this story.</p>
<p>This brainless anti-white should be roundluy condemned, not apologized too, yet those like O&rsquo;Reilly are too caught up in themselves to notice the obvious.  It&rsquo;s just as well, however, because they would be too afraid to point out the obvious even if they had the mentality to pick up on it.</p>
<p>And O&rsquo;Reilly thinks nobody can report on anything unless he/she is a journalist, as if this easiest of all jobs was something special.  He&rsquo;s not living in the real world a good part of the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waiting for these &#8220;bright&#8221; talk show hosts to pick up on the bias, resentment and jealousy they over looked.  Andrew Brightbart made it VERY clear the video was for the purpose of revealing the NAACP as calling other groups racist when their own is blatantly so.  I believe the word is &#8220;hypocrites.&#8221;  But don&rsquo;t look for anyone but Glenn or Rush to point that out.</p>

		<p><i>And O&rsquo;Reilly thinks nobody can report on anything unless he/she is a journalist, as if this easiest of all jobs was something special.</i></p>
<p>So saith the former anchor of <i>Inside Edition</i>, a gossip hour with journalistic integrity that is only one wee slight little baby step higher than that of TMZ, and two higher than the National Enquirer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to think that Breitbart never took anything out of context   &mdash;   Some people who only viewed part of the video did.  (Including me at first).  But I didn&rsquo;t have the power to fire Sherrod, Breitbart didn&rsquo;t have that power either.  It was a NAACP event   &mdash;   They had the whole video (and Breitbart put up in essence everything important to begin with), so they could have kept Obama/Vilsack from firing her with one phone call.  I&rsquo;m starting to come around to PJB&rsquo;s theory, that they fired her b/c the WH is in utter pandemonium about hemorrhaging white support.</p>

&#8220;If a man like Ward Connerly or Thomas Sowell was President he probably would try to promote non-racial policies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ward Connerly or Sowell would have better economic policies, but if you think they would be measurably different when it comes to social issues favoring blacks I&rsquo;ve got a bridge in Brooklyn I&rsquo;d like to sell you.  </p>
<p>Too, almost every black run city, state, and country is a disaster and there&rsquo;s no reason to believe that these two blacks would be an improvement over the others generally.  Will people like you ever understand that any black in the office of president is going to have an administration rife with unqualified blacks, right along with pushing a pro-black agenda?</p>
<p>Let me guess.  If you had been around at the founding of this country, you would have been one of the do-gooders who pushed to make friends with the Indians who were setting a trap to massacre all the whites, as reported in an issue of Amren a while back.</p>
<p>World Net Daily is pushing the brilliant scholar Herman Caine to run against Obama in 2012.  Such a gifted intellectual.  Too, take note they even went so far as to claim that Caine was the only person who could beat Obama in 2012.  My respect for Joe Farah dropped to almost zero after reading that.</p>
<p>What is it with you people that you must tout a black?  Is it  because Obama is failing and is in over his head?  Does it bother you that another black is at the helm of a government and he&rsquo;s doing just as badly as all the rest, and, because of that,  you have a pressing desire to upgrade the black image?  </p>
<p>Most people on here wouldn&rsquo;t vote for either of your choices, and neither would most of the other consevative whites in this country. And they certainly wouldn&rsquo;t vote for Herman Caine.</p>
<p>&#8220;But nobody who had read Obama&rsquo;s Dreams of My Father, or knew of his career as a community organizer, or was familiar with the doctrine of his church of 19 years, would have any illusions at all that Obama would be a &ldquo;post-racial&rdquo; President. Race has been his obsession since his childhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wish that had been true.  The fact that so many people who voted for him were fully aware of his background and his book makes it obvious that we are beset with FAR too many gullible people in this country.  It&rsquo;s turning out to be our downfall.  They had high hopes for him like you have for Connerly and Sowell, and WND has for Herman Caine.  They just so badly wanted to do good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really disgraceful.  Is there something wrong with wanting to elect a candidate who is white, not black, and is not a Washington insider and part of the good old boy network?</p>

<p>I would be the last to bet on that after seeing the bias among blacks from every quarter of their poulation.</p>
<p>After the mess this black has made of things and the biases of him and every black in his administration are you sure any other blacks would be non-racial, just because they are perceived to be conservative?  </p>
<p>I would hope that people are now more enlightened about black leaders after a wealth of proof that they are absolute disasters, from so many examples we&rsquo;ve witnessed.   It&rsquo;s hard to keep track of them all.</p>

		<p>To sam d and q, both Thomas Sowell and Ward Connerly have come out strongly against affirmative action.  (Connerly regularly campaigns against it.)  They would probably put fewer incompetent blacks into government than 95% of the white Democrats or Republicans.  I doubt very much that either of them would have quashed to case against the New Black Panthers for voter intimidation.<br>

		<p>It has been about nothing but race since day one of the current presidency.  Obama&rsquo;s dream is an America where people of color live in the suburbs with a standard of living comparable with that enjoyed by whites, complete with two-car garages, finely manicured lawns, and cul-de-sacs.  It is a castle in the sky.  It will never happen.  </p>

<p>WHY is everybody concentrated on a black man that could do better than obama? I knew this was going to happen. As soon as obama made it in everyone will start looking for other black men to head this Country.</p>
