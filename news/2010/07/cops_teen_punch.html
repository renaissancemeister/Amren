<h1>Cops: Teen Punched Man for Listening to Rap Music</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WFTV-TV (Orlando), July 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 14-year-old Palm Bay boy {snip} beat up the 22-year-old man because he didn&rsquo;t think white people should listen to rap music, police said. The man told WFTV he was listening to &#8220;Wasted&#8221; by Gucci Mane.</p>
<p>David McKnight did not fight back when 14-year-old Joshuah Lamb punched him in the face repeatedly, investigators said. Battery is the only charge Lamb faces, but he could face felony hate crime charges.</p>
<p>McKnight said he was listening to a CD when he was attacked by the teen. McKnight never thought listening to rap music would trigger a black teenager to beat him up because of the color of his skin and choice of music.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The argument involved the black male suspect saying, &#8216;You shouldn&rsquo;t be listening to rap music because you&rsquo;re white.&rsquo; The victim said he can listen to whatever type of music he wanted to and then the fist fight was on,&#8221; Palm Bay police spokeswoman Yvonne Martinez said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&rsquo;t get away fast enough, let&rsquo;s just put it that way. Then one of them spit on me, punched me, knocked me down, got a couple of kicks in from a couple of them,&#8221; McKnight said.</p>
<p>McKnight suffered a broken toe, concussion, a swollen eye and strangulation marks around his neck. Police said the 14-year-old was with at least seven of his friends, all of whom were instigating the fight.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The State Attorney&rsquo;s Office is in the process of trying to figure out if it can charge the boy with a hate crime. State prosecutors said it could be one to two weeks before they decide if the 14-year-old will be charged with a hate crime charge.</p>

		<p>How else would the rap genre survive if a lot of young whites didn&rsquo;t listen to the particular genre of &#8220;music&#8221; and purchase it?  While I don&rsquo;t believe that the figure is as high as 70% white, as some have claimed, I can believe it&rsquo;s at least a majority.</p>

		<p>That would be awesome if the kid was charged and convicted of a hate crime, as I&rsquo;m sure I white kid would be, but I&rsquo;m not keeping my hopes up. Can you imagine a white group of thugs beating up a black man for listening to rock music? That would be national news no doubt.</p>

<p>I can agree with that much, at least.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;State prosecutors said it could be one to two weeks before they decide if the 14-year-old will be charged with a hate crime charge.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Really?  <i>Two weeks</i>?  Does it normally take them that long to discover &#8220;hate&#8221; when it&rsquo;s a White who stands accused?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;McKnight never thought listening to rap music would trigger a black teenager to beat him up because of the color of his skin and choice of music.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I wonder if Mr. McKnight has had a revelation based upon his experience.  Perhaps the world isn&rsquo;t precisely the way <i>The Cosby Show</i> indicated, after all.<br>

		<p>1. White people SHOULD NOT BE LISTENING TO RAP MUSIC!</p>
<p>2. This was an attack by a gang, NOT just a single lone 14 year old &#8220;boy&#8221;. How dare they use that word &#8220;boy&#8221; to describe a black male. Among the black folks, there is no such thing as a &#8220;boy&#8221;. ONLY a young adult or a young man, regardless of age. NOT &#8220;boy&#8221;. How dare they.</p>
<p>3. A 14 year old black &#8220;boy&#8221; has the body, the muscularity and strength of a grown man. They mature at an earlier age, and mature more so and faster when they do mature.</p>

		<p>Technically, what the black youth did was wrong; however, I can&rsquo;t say that it displeases me. Whites really should have more sense than to listen to &#8220;rap.&#8221; Music appreciation classes in the public schools are a disgrace, to say he least. But what can we expect with forced integration holding sway?</p>

<p>First, it is hard to fathom letting someone punch you &#8220;repeatedly&#8221; in the face and not fight back. But later in the article it is finally revealed that the thug had SEVEN friends with him. There is no doubt that Mr McKnight would be fighting EIGHT of these thugs if he had fought back. Still he should have tried to protect himself. Ideally, he would have produced a 9 millimeter, or reasonable facsimile, and let the chips fall where they may.</p>
<p><br>
The laughable part of this story is this line: &#8220;&hellip;.but he could face felony hate crime charges.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
C&rsquo;mon!!! Eight blacks surround and attack a LONE WHITE for the crime of being White and the writer thinks its POSSIBLE that one, (ONE MIND YOU) of these thugs &#8220;could&#8221; face felony hatecrimes charges. This writer apparently isnt familiar with how hatecrimes charges are divvied out. IMO, there is less than a ZERO chance (is that possible?) that this thug will be charged with a hatecrime. </p>

<p>Many white people bear black people no ill will and have moved on from the past.</p>
<p>Black people have not moved on. If you are white, they hate you. </p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t much indication that they are hating white people any less either.</p>

I agree!</p>
<p>Punch him one more time for me, homie.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind that rap is popular among some whites, because they&rsquo;re just as moronic as the average black.  </p>
<p>If whites could get rid of all their knuckle draggers who listen to rap, our group average I.Q. would increase to about 115.</p>

		<p>The truly astonishing thing about this piece is the headline.  &#8220;teen&#8221; &#8220;punches&#8221; &#8220;man&#8221; ???  First, this makes it sound as if the victim was struck only one single time, during the attack.  We are led to believe there was a single assailant, and the wording makes it seem that a smaller, younger person struck a large, mature male.  Like a kid punching a big man on the arm&hellip;</p>
<p>All of this is so typical of what I&rsquo;d call the &#8220;trading-down&#8221; that goes on with today&rsquo;s &#8220;journalists&#8221;, when it comes to describing nonwhite-on-white crime.</p>
<p>A more accurate headline would have been &#8220;Gang of Eight Blacks Viciously Assaults Lone White for Listening to Rap Music&#8221;.</p>

<p>I hope this story wakes up a few white young people to the fact that &#8220;digging&#8221; blacks&rsquo; music won&rsquo;t make make blacks dig <i>them</i>. Many young whites think that showing black people that they &#8220;get&#8221;   &mdash;   and even LOVE   &mdash;   black culture will somehow guarantee them immunity from black hostility. This unfortunate white Floridian just learned the hard way that this is not so. </p>
<p>Blacks   &mdash;   uniquely among races   &mdash;   jealously guard &#8220;their&#8221; musical accomplishments from outsiders. I expect the average Asian would probably be welcoming of a Caucasian with a sincere interest in traditional Japanese or Chinese music. Even latinos will generally like an anglo better if the anglo enjoys and is knowledgeable about, say, salsa or merengue   &mdash;   it at least gives the two of you something to talk about. It&rsquo;s blacks AND ONLY BLACKS that get upset about other people &#8220;stealing&#8221; &#8220;their&#8221; music   &mdash;   whether it&rsquo;s Pat Boone covering Little Richard; or a 22-yr-old white kid in Florida boppin&rsquo; his head to the latest hip-hop beats. </p>
<p>This incident also points up something that&rsquo;s been said here on AR from time to time, and that is that it&rsquo;s better to have blacks fear you than to like you. White liberals go out of their way to show their black &#8220;friends&#8221; that they&rsquo;re &#8220;down&#8221; with Af-Am music and movies and culture. They think this will make blacks like them more. In my experience it does not. I think this behavior by white libs mostly strikes blacks not as sincere appreciation, but as condescension, pandering, and &#8220;trying too hard.&#8221; IOW, it doesn&rsquo;t do any good   &mdash;   whereas a more strong, even &#8220;redneck&#8221; kind of stance from a white person who&rsquo;s unapologetic about his whiteness, is ironically more likely to command respect. </p>
<p>Contrary to what the MSM has been telling us for decades, being extra nice to blacks and trying to adopt their ways will NOT make our dealings with them go smoother. In fact, quite the opposite: such appeasement only makes us appear weak, and therefore victimizable. <br>

		<p>I hate to say it but the kid is right- White people should not be listening to rap music! OF COURSE it is a hate crime but I will not be surprised to see the news in a week or two that he is just being charged with assault without the enhancement. I have seen the phenomena of people not fighting back when attacked, I have to wonder if this is a result of schools teaching kids to not fight back if they are hit and the ridiculous &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; rule. I was taught by my grandmother that if I started a fight then I was in trouble but if I was attacked and did not defend myself I was equally in trouble. She had to come to school and go to bat for me a couple of times but it was worth it. Unfortunately with the common black attack of 6-7 on one all a person can do is try to get the attackers behind one another, not get your back to a door or other escape and get away from the situation as quickly as possible.</p>

		<p>Thing is, the sort of white man who would choose to listen to rap in the first place is precisely the sort who would not fight back when attacked by a black man for listening to said &#8220;music&#8221;. Counterintuitive, perhaps, but there you are. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right.  White people should not be listening to rap music.  But that is beside the point.  I disagree with your point about the &#8220;muscularity&#8221; of a 14-year old Black.  The story reads:</p>
<p>David McKnight did not fight back when 14-year-old Joshuah Lamb punched him in the face repeatedly, investigators said.</p>
<p>This is pathetic.  Utterly pathetic.  A 22 year old White LETTING himself get beaten up by a 14 year old.  This is cowardice of the highest order.  This is a perfect example of what is happening to Whites.  We are MORALLY DISARMED.  We are psychologically whipped.  We have to turn this around.  We have the numbers.  We don&rsquo;t have the will.  And don&rsquo;t say, &#8220;How dare they!&#8221;  They dare.  They dare because most Whites are LETTING this happen.  And these Blacks know it.  They don&rsquo;t have to have a 140 IQ.  They&rsquo;re just doing what the beasts in the jungle would do when they know that they have their prey where they want it.  </p>
<p>Wake up White people.</p>

		<p>So many white kids listen to rap music - and emulate the lifestyle - that it&rsquo;s unnerving to say the least.  How did this happen?  What happened to rock and country and even good old fashioned punk?</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m at, every other white teenage boy has his pants hanging down, head shaved, talking rap trash, and walks like a ghetto thug.  And these are white kids!  </p>
<p>Every other white girl is a ghetto rat wanna be and a lot of white girls out here in NYC are with black thugs.  I saw one in the grocery store today.  It was so incongruent because I live in a 95% white and Asian area, but when i turned down the pickle aisle, there they were!  A skinny black thug in the required white undershirt, do-rag, jeans falling down, slouching with his hands in his pocket.  The pretty white girl was hovering around him and asking which type of pickles to get.  He was mumbling something while she was coherent and well spoken.  I just shook my head and walked away.</p>
<p>When I see normal white teens I actually do a double take because they are such a rarity now.</p>

Having said that, I agree; a white shouldn&rsquo;t be listening to rap. Perhaps this is a &#8220;teachable moment&#8221;, in Obamaspeak, for this aesthetically challenged young man.    </p>

		<p>The thug did have a point, whites should never listen to rap music. Indeed it is anti-white slander, hate speech and incites violence against us, white girls and women especially. However, I think the thug would have deserved it if he got his face shattered by either a series of pile-driver punches or a large caliber bullet striking   him between his eyes.</p>

		<p>I can say with complete honesty that I cannot think of a more  stupid and vacant-headed &#8216;music&rsquo; genre that rap, hip-hop or whatever you call it. If you&rsquo;re a big enough vacuum-head to listen to it in public and you get a punch or two that&rsquo;s your look-out I suppose. Then again, if he was listening to Claudio Monteverdi in public would the same thing have happened?</p>
<p>By some sort of happy co-incidence I listen to absolutely no black genre of music at all, it just turned out that way. No motown, blues, rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll, rap etc. Even the &#8216;rock&rsquo; music I listen to has no black appeal.</p>

The reporter low balled the number of &#8220;toddlers&#8221; who were involved in the attack on the &#8220;man&#8221;. They all participated in the attack. They&rsquo;re only brave when they outnumber their victim, unless the victim is a helpless woman. Have you noticed that these so called 15 old boys always look about 25?</p>

Second, they would&rsquo;ve attacked him just as fast he had been listening to rock or country. They were a roving gang looking to do harm to a White.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe a word of this story. When a gang goes on the prowl looking for someone to attack any excuse will do. The fact that a white guy was listening to rap music didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with it. They were just looking for a white to attack and the reason is of little importance to them. </p>
<p>Blacks are some of the biggest cowards in the world when it comes to a one on one fight but in a gang where they have all the advantages they will attack. </p>

		<p>To #15: I think that you are overstating your case. First, the man was being attacked by no less than eight street thugs. Second, they were apparently all minors and all blacks. If the victim through even one punch he would be either dead or in prison facing eight counts of hate crime and assaulting a minor with intent to kill. That being the case, not fighting back was probably the right choice.</p>
<p>On a different note, how can the writer of this article and the police spokeswoman seriously consider this attack a &#8220;fight&#8221;? </p>

		<p>#12 Sid: &#8220;I support the black kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>So now we have AmRenners who agree with Blacks ganging up on a White, given these particular circumstances? What?!?!? I understand why some of you feel disgust towards Whites who listen to rap.  Even though the &#8220;English&#8221; used in American rap is deplorable, the lyrics often project a sort of cocky arrogance that, to me, is missing among many White males.  But I wouldn&rsquo;t expect many posters on this site to realize that, because most here probably haven&rsquo;t heard more than 10 consecutive seconds of a rap song.  </p>
<p>My main point, however, is not in support of rap music.  I think almost all rap music has a terrible effect on society.  But just because one White young adult chose to listen to a rap song does not mean any of us should SUPPORT a pack of low-IQ Blacks in a racially-motivated beating.</p>

		<p>Daniel: &#8220;The fact that a white guy was listening to rap music didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with it. They were just looking for a white to attack and the reason is of little importance to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly.  While almost every poster on here is bemoaning the White youth who listens to rap, they are missing the more serious development: yet another pack of Blacks ganged up on and beat a White for racial reasons.  This may not be so uncommon in &#8220;Post-Racial&#8221; America, but it is still of the utmost importance.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I`d like to punch White kids for listening to rap.&#8221;-C Hastings<br>
I had a little program going when ever I would see White kids either dressing or otherwise embracing the Rap lifestyle. I would walk up to them and comment how I noticed their choice of dress or music. Then I would innocently ask if &#8220;that helped them get girls.&#8221; When they proudly announced that it did, my final response would be along the lines of, &#8220;Have you ever thought that any  White girls who like you for acting Black aren`t worth trying for to begin with?!?!&#8221;  The look I`d get would be almost priceless. One final word. My neighbor and best friend of forty years warned me that talking about race and girls to teen-age boys could very well get me arrested&hellip;</p>

		<p>You people are being played.  When they make the white look like a wimp for getting nailed by a lone black youth.  When they make him look like a black wannabe.  You are _supposed_ to be turned off of any sympathy.</p>
<p>The MSM cannot deny the facts.  So they make the facts themselves the weapon.  In the psy-ops business, this is called spiritual disenfranchisement.  Where you push the idea that something is worthwhile based on &#8216;brand association&rsquo; and then utterly smash the values of the individual HUMAN BEING to which the label is attached to better destroy the group identity.</p>
<p>And if you are any kind of example, it worked, perfectly.</p>
<p>The guy was white, that means he doesn&rsquo;t think like a victim and so is easier to make into one.  He had a possibly expensive portable CD player when he was tagged for the mugging.</p>
<p>THOSE TWO FACTS are what most likely &#8216;started the fight&rsquo;.  And the &#8220;can&rsquo;t listen to our music&#8221; stuff?  The same basic reflexive panic psychology argument used when an overtly gay man is beaten up by homophobes.  Gives the defense an instant spin and keeps the _base motive_: robbery, from coming to the fore.</p>
<p>If it was robbery, why that would be dangerous and blatantly criminal to everyone.  But since it&rsquo;s -race-, it only matters if whites matter.  And to a jury of his peers, **any excuse will do** when it&rsquo;s white vs. black.</p>
<p>Grow up, give the guy a hand up, teach him about his people and his _responsibility_ to defend that heritage.  Don&rsquo;t throw him out because he is, at the moment, weak.  80-90% of whites are the same way.</p>
<p>At the very least, don&rsquo;t play into the game of social fragmentation.</p>

		<p>I hate to say this but when I see a white person listening to rap,wearing their trousers hanging off of the rear end three sizes to large with a backwards baseball cap I feel like punching them.</p>

		<p>More than likely this attack had nothing to do with what the victim was listening to.  It was just the approach the black gang used.  They were intent on attacking a white, male or female it didn&rsquo;t matter.  It was probably a gang initiation or something of that nature.  The attacker will get a short stint in juvenile jail and will be lauded by his hood for gaining street cred and beating up a white boy. Next the teen will gradutate to armed robbery and more serious offenses and will spend time in adult prison.  By the time he is 25 he will either be imprisoned or dead, and white society will be blamed.</p>

<p>We have to turn this around. We have the numbers. We don&rsquo;t have the will. And don&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;How dare they?&rdquo;   &mdash;   They dare! They dare because most Whites are LETTING this happen. And these Blacks know it. They don&rsquo;t need to have a 140 IQ. They&rsquo;re just doing what the beasts in the jungle do when they know that they have their prey where they want it. </p>

Where I am, every other white teenage boy has his pants hanging down, head shaved, talking rap trash, and walks like a ghetto thug. &hellip;Every other white girl is a ghetto rat wanna be&hellip;<br>
When I see normal white teens, I actually do a double take because they are such a rarity now.</p>

<p>So many interesting comments and points of view here!  I also note, as Gen.Lee did too, the surprising number of posters agreeing with the thug. And I agree with Daniel that this was probably just their approach, a convenient excuse for robbery of an expensive CD. In such case, ANY excuse would do. Blacks always like to have a moral justification for whatever they do. That gives them a sense of offended moral outrage. (How dare you steal their music, whitey?!!!)</p>
<p>The reporting was terrible. I would especially make a point that this was: </p>
<p>a) not a &#8220;fight&#8221;  (he never attempted to fight back), but an unprovoked ATTACK.</p>
<p>b) it was not just a single thug (a &#8220;14-year-old boy&#8221; as the reporter so delicately puts it), but a GANG of at least eight!</p>
<p>c) Why didn&rsquo;t he fight back?  The others were probably holding him while he was being &#8220;repeatedly punched in the face&#8221;.  There were strangulation marks on his throat. The attacker who was punching him could not possibly have been holding him by the throat and punching him at the same time! He was also kicked and spat on by &#8220;a couple of them&#8221;.</p>
<p>d) since this was obviously a gang attack, why is that fact being played down and only one perp charged with assault? Where are the others?</p>
<p>e) It could take TWO WEEKS to decide if there will be a Hate Crime charge? Oh really?  More likely, it will take two weeks to let the matter die down and sweep it under the rug. Or to find some plausible argument against considering it a Hate Crime. Cops and justice system officials do not like being forced to handle Hate Crimes against whites; that&rsquo;s not what Hate Crimes were meant for.</p>
