<h1>The Great Tea Party/NAACP Racism Fiasco</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Edwards, The Political Cesspool, July 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Last week, the NAACP passed a resolution condemning the &#8220;racism&#8221; of the Tea Party movement, and demanding that the movement purge itself of those hideous &#8220;racists&#8221; in their grass roots movement. Yes, the very same mental midgets who just a few weeks ago were condemning a Hallmark greeting card with an outer space theme because they think &#8220;black holes&#8221; means &#8220;black hos&#8221;, an organization which is explicitly organized for the exclusive benefit of one race of people, and whose name contains the words &#8220;Colored People&#8221;, actually had the gall to pass this resolution.</p>
<p>This was a great opportunity for the Tea Party movement to show some backbone by laughing in the face of the imbeciles at the NAACP. But did they? Of course not. Predictably, they responded in the same tired, pusillanimous manner with which they always respond to these never ending accusations. Instead of replying with a loud BWAHAHAHA! or a &#8220;Yeah? What&rsquo;s your point?&#8221; or &#8220;So what?&#8221; or &#8220;Of course we&rsquo;re racists  &mdash;  we&rsquo;re white people. That&rsquo;s what &#8220;racist&#8221; means&#8221; or &#8220;Can any of you race hustlers even spell &#8220;racist&#8221;?&#8221;, they predictably went into their usual bend over and grab their ankles mode. They protested that oh no, we&rsquo;re not racists at all, we don&rsquo;t tolerate racists at our rallies which are really huge rainbow coalitions, and it&rsquo;s the NAACP and the liberals who are the real racists, etc., etc. You know, the lame &#8220;Bull Connor was a Democrat!&#8221; defense. It never works, but they just keep trotting it out like some lucky charm in the vain hope that this time it will work. But, as always, it never does. They also pointed out the &#8220;hypocrisy&#8221; of a race based group like the NAACP calling another group racist, proving yet again that they haven&rsquo;t got a clue. Favoring the black race over the white race isn&rsquo;t &#8220;racist&#8221;; being white is racist. I guess they think that the NAACP and the media just never realized that the NAACP is a race based organization, and if they point it out, they&rsquo;ll all slap their heads and realize their mistake, and the NAACP will disband, and the media will start treating all race based groups as racist, not just white ones.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Racist means white person. Period. Until the Tea Partiers get that through their heads, nothing&rsquo;s going to change, and they&rsquo;re never going to be an effective political force. They really, really need to read Racism, Schmacism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But one Tea Party leader, Mark Williams, decided to take things a step further, and thought he&rsquo;d try his hand at &#8220;satire&#8221; to lampoon the NAACP. He wrote Mark Williams&rsquo; Letter to Abe Lincoln from The Coloreds, {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Well, sir, no sooner did Mark Williams hit &#8220;Publish&#8221; on that letter than the diversity hit the fan. Liberals went insane, &#8220;the coloreds&#8221; went ape, and even many of Mark Williams&rsquo; fans and supporters left comments telling him how &#8220;offensive&#8221; and &#8220;racist&#8221; his attempt at satire was. But he wasn&rsquo;t backing down. He stood by his post. For a while. Then he did make a few minor changes. You know, because he wasn&rsquo;t backing down!</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A lot of good it did him, though. On Sunday, the head of the National Tea Party Federation went on Face The Nation and announced that Mark Williams and his group, the Tea Party Express, had been kicked out of the Tea Party Federation for &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Well, Mark Williams deserves to be expelled from the Tea Party movement. Not for the letter he wrote, which is actually pretty funny and is &#8220;offensive&#8221; only because it&rsquo;s pretty much true. No, he should have been kicked out of the movement, a long time ago, because he&rsquo;s a bald faced liar. You just watched him lie through his teeth on that video, claiming that race had nothing to do with his letter. But that&rsquo;s nothing. Not long ago, he claimed that he was &#8220;in the streets marching for civil rights&#8221; while Southern sheriffs were beating black protesters. According to an article linked to on his own website, Mark Williams graduated from high school in 1974. So he was born around 1956. Southern sheriffs were beating black Civil Rights protesters in the late 1950s and early 1960s. And Mark Williams was &#8220;in the streets marching for civil rights&#8221; at the same time?</p>
<p>When he was four or five years old?</p>
<p>Mark Williams is just a lying sleazebag who likes to be on TV. Let&rsquo;s be honest  &mdash;  anyone who wrote that letter isn&rsquo;t very fond of black people. Period. Yet he panders to blacks non-stop, claiming he was marching in the street for them when he was in diapers. {snip}</p>
<p>And how about David Webb, the head of the National Tea Party Federation? Blacks make up maybe 1 out of every 150 people at Tea Party rallies, if that, so a black man heads up the federation? {snip} David Webb also wants to have a joint meeting with the NAACP. {snip} He has another group, Tea Party 365, which is holding a get together on July 31 in Philadelphia called Uni-Tea. {snip} You might have guessed that from the stupid, ghetto sounding name. Uni-Tea is supposed to show blacks &#8220;how Big Government is robbing you of jobs, money, education and opportunity!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thirteen speakers are lined up; nine of them are black. {snip} Another of the white speakers is that sleazy scumbag Andrew Breitbart, who called Jared Taylor &#8220;despicable&#8221; for holding meetings aimed at promoting white people&rsquo;s interests. Here&rsquo;s the link to the video  &mdash;  go to the 6:40 mark to see Breitbart insult Jared Taylor. Jared is a &#8220;despicable&#8221; human being for organizing meetings for white people, but it&rsquo;s fine for scumbag Breitbart to attend a meeting aimed at blacks.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the kicker. In the Face The Nation video, at the 7:00 mark, David Webb says he wants the NAACP leadership to attend the Uni-Tea rally so that America can finally have a national forum about race. Uni-Tea is a meeting for black people. The NAACP is an organization for black people. And in the opinion of the head of the Tea Party Federation, if you combine the two, you&rsquo;ve got a &#8220;national forum&#8221; on race, even though no white people are invited.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you get when you install black people in leadership positions in the Tea Party. And the only reason David Webb is at the head of the Tea Party Federation is because Tea Partiers don&rsquo;t want to be called racist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Does anyone else see the complete absurdity of this situation? A movement that&rsquo;s 95% white has somehow become solely focused on black people. They like to &#8220;brag&#8221; that one survey found that the Tea Party is only about 75% white, but that&rsquo;s nonsense, as anyone can see for themselves. It&rsquo;s a white movement. They used to stand for something  &mdash;  limited government, lower taxes, no bail outs, etc. They came together to do something about their concerns, and their meetings were open to all. But blacks don&rsquo;t care about that stuff, so very few of them show up. And because they believe that white people have no legitimate interests, Tea Parties started bending over backwards to pander to blacks and fill their podiums with them, so liberals would stop calling them the R word.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s nothing but all black people, all the time. When they&rsquo;re not promoting tokens to leadership positions, they&rsquo;re accusing the NAACP of being racists and hating blacks, then they&rsquo;re turning around and inviting the NAACP to strategize with them on the best ways to deal with the problems blacks face, or they&rsquo;re screaming &#8220;Democrats are the real racists! {snip} For crying out loud, after this episode, the Tea Party movement might as well merge with the NAACP.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} A movement that could have been powerful has been brought to its knees because of white people&rsquo;s silly, abject fears of being called a six letter word. So they spend all their time trying to attract the people who have no interest in their movement, and never will. And what do they get in return? They get called &#8220;racist&#8221; yet again, and they immediately go back to groveling.</p>
<p>Every Tea Partier in America needs to read Racism, Schmacism.</p>

		<p>The Tea Party showed promise, once.  Now they&rsquo;re an organization devoted full-time to groveling full-time before the altar of Holy Diversity.  Apparently the possibility of winning was overshadowed by the terror of being called Racist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why conservatives always lose.<br>

		<p>Of course I&rsquo;m racist!  </p>
<p>I love my family and I love my extended family   &mdash;   my cousins, uncles, aunts, grandparents, and grandkids.  I love the great things that my ancestors did, and I will love my future great grandkids, if I live long enough to experience that joy.  I love my super-extended family   &mdash;   the millions of European-Americans and White people everywhere.  I love the safe, prosperous, ordered societies that they create.  I love the amazing scientific, artistic, economic, technical, and political advances that the European races have brought to the world   &mdash;   my God!   &mdash;   everything from democracy to moon travel to curing diseases to modern agriculture to beautiful art, music, and theater.  Few other races of people come close to these accomplishments. Yes, Jews are also very creative and I admire them for that.  Northeastern Asians are also highly intelligent, creative, and produce beautiful art.  However, the other races simply cannot hold a candle to Europeans, and some are utter failures at producing civilization.  Their societies are ruled by poverty, disease, brutality, crime, ignorance, and misery.   </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that I don&rsquo;t appreciate the smattering of accomplishments of some other races.  I am in awe at the athletic and musical abilities of Africans, and many races produce tasty food and interesting art, dances and costumes.  I am fascinated how the Inuit can withstand cold and the Tibetans can live at high altitudes.    &mdash;   I wish all of them good luck and success.  However, after traveling the World and living in most continents, there is simply no comparison.  White civilization is better, and I love my family and my extended family above all other races. Why on Earth would anyone expect me to love Africans, Arabs, Asians or AmerIndians more than my own people?   Who came up with such a ridiculous idea!  Of course I&rsquo;m a racist.  </p>

		<p>James Edwards exposes Breitbart&rsquo;s hate for Jared Taylor.  While I&rsquo;m glad Breitbart slapped back at the NAACP through this whole USDA/NAACP video snip, I&rsquo;m surprised he&rsquo;s opposed to anti-white racism at all.  You endorse anti-white racism when you come out against Jared Taylor.  Simple as that.</p>

		<p>You gotta fight fire with fire. There is no other way to against the race-replacment of Native Born White Americans. We have to fight back with in-your-face Native Born White American racial politcs.</p>
<p>Someone-James Edwatds perhaps-should collect as many anti-White statements made by black-Asian-Hispanic-activist,celebrities and politicians. There must be dozens of them by now. Two of my favorites are by Mario Obledo-&#8220;The last gasp of White America-and the one made by millionaire Latina and MSM news celebrity Soledade O&rsquo;Brian on the night the foreigner from Kenya was elected president of my country..something about White Males are history. </p>
<p>James Edwards, I highly recommend you track down the Soledade O&rsquo;Brian quote. Use them both on every radio show you do and TV interview you do.</p>
<p>The NAACP in partnership with LA RAZA-THE RACE- are waging a vicous race war against the Native Born White Majprity. </p>
<p>Cielia Munoz former head of LA RAZA-THE RACE- has an office in Barack Obama&rsquo;s White House. Attack like a pitt bull!!!!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Racist means white person. Period. Until the Tea Partiers get that through their heads, nothing&rsquo;s going to change, and they&rsquo;re never going to be an effective political force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, this is as true a statement that you can have or want!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we live in a time period where a single &ldquo;word,&rdquo; this insidiously and cowardly slur of &ldquo;racist,&rdquo; is used to degradingly silence any white person who rejects Neo Marxism and the genocidal multicultural Disneyland it presumes to &ldquo;restructure&rdquo; the USA into. That is the hard facts of our political life in 2010; it is also why, when confronted with this fecklessly wretched slur, that uncompromising gotcha tactics must be used in responding to those who employ it. </p>
<p>The word &ldquo;racism&rdquo; must be deconstructed along with the Communist-diversity paradigm its fanatical exponents embrace, if we are ever going to gain any ground beyond what the &ldquo;Obama Revolution&rdquo; of &ldquo;hope and change&rdquo; has so advantageously, if also ephemerally, granted to us. Attempting to embrace or redirect that transitory orgy of anti-Western and multicultural euphoria, by any white movement (be it racially conscious or not) will simply backfire and destroy it.<br>
 <br>
Tea time with the Tea Party movement, certainly demonstrates that the Kool Aid and Oreos cannot replace the Earl Grey and finger sandwiches, in other words.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

		<p>Whatever else &#8220;hate speech&#8221; is, anyone who smears another in reckless disregard of truth is guilty of it. And any group that employs hate speech is by definition a &#8220;hate group&#8221;.</p>
<p>Our &#8220;neighbors&#8221; the NAACP have just proved to the whole world they are a &#8220;hate group&#8221;.</p>
<p>To friend and foe alike, I say: The Commandment forbids bearing false witness against our neighbor. We may not like him, we may know he is despicable, but we may not lie about him. The unvarnished truth will expose our enemy if we picked him well. If we play fast and loose with the truth, we are just plain stupid, and have several serious problems. <br>

		<p>You know we should have expected this groveling.  You know it.  The question I ask myself is how long is it going to go on?  All we need is one courageous White person or group standing up to help lead the way.  It&rsquo;s incredible how cowardly most White people are; not the way Holder says it though, he just wants Whites to do more groveling.  We just want one person or a group to stand up and not back down.</p>

		<p>The so called &#8216;Tea Party&rsquo; backed down because it is NOT the REAL &#8216;Tea Party&rsquo; of Ron Paul.  It is the NEW, CORRUPTED version which rejects Ron Paul and REAL &#8216;Libertarians.&rsquo;  Only Neoconned &#8216;Beltway&rsquo; &#8220;Libertarians&#8221; are allowed in the mis-named &#8216;Tea Party,&rsquo; and this is why it caved&hellip;,because that&rsquo;s what STATISTS do!</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;They really, really need to read Racism, Schmacism&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not kidding.  It&rsquo;s a funny funny book but deadly serious too.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quote:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Folks, you will never be able to understand politics and culture in today&rsquo;s America unless you grasp this fundamental truth at the root of more and more political and cultural battles in this country: A racist is a white person.</p>
<p>Racist equals white person, and white person equals racist.</p>
<p>All white people are racist, and they&rsquo;re always racist, and they will always be racist.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>Write that down in your day planner, make a note of it on your Blackberry or iPhone, put little sticky notes all over your house, or whatever you have to do until this message sinks in. Because until you grasp this, less and less of what&rsquo;s going on in this country will make any sense at all, and you&rsquo;ll be at the mercy of the liberal mainstream media, aggressive and hostile racial pressure groups, and white liberals (who are deluding themselves by thinking they&rsquo;re not racist)&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/26xebwh" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/26xebwh</a></p>
<p>James Edwards also states:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Instead of replying with a loud BWAHAHAHA! or a &#8216;Yeah? What&rsquo;s your point?&rsquo; or &#8216;So what?&rsquo; or &#8216;Of course we&rsquo;re racists &mdash; we&rsquo;re white people!&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, Edwards couldn&rsquo;t be more correct.  Ridicule is a tactic straight out of saul alinksy&rsquo;s playbook  &mdash;  the current Bible of the obama regime  &mdash;   and has been used very effectively (via the media) against Whites:</p>
<p>Rule # 5:  Ridicule is man&rsquo;s most potent weapon. It is almost impossible to counteract ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition, which then reacts to your advantage.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/yg5hkc6" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yg5hkc6</a></p>
<p>No White will ever succeed in proving  &#8220;I am not a racist!&#8221;  He has lost the second he states these five stupid words and no amount of groveling, *** kissing or apologizing will rectify the situation  &mdash;  AND he makes himself look weak and foolish (which is the entire point!).</p>
<p>It boils my blood whenever I hear this statement.</p>
<p>Jupiter puts it perfectly:  &#8220;You gotta fight fire with fire. There is no other way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Accusations of racism deserve nothing less than an immediate, ruthless counterattack.</p>

		<p>In my opinion, <i>Racism, Schmacism</i> is potentially one of the most powerful weapons of propaganda ever developed for our cause. It fits in perfectly with the AmRen style of approach and is great for White lemmings who cannot handle a more lengthy and complete biological understanding of our struggle (which is probably most Whites).</p>
<p>Edwards&rsquo; brilliant and innovative approach represents a new generation of White Nationalist ideological weaponry, whose strategy is to get Whites to further their racial interests without realizing that they are so doing, but rather to think that they are fighting for their beloved &#8220;conservative values&#8221; against the evil liberals by becoming less sensitive to accusations of the dreaded and feared &#8220;Racism!&#8221;.</p>
<p>As Sam Dickson would say about how strange it is to have to work so hard to get Whites to act in their own interests: <i>&#8220;Even an Amoeba has a sufficiently high IQ to want the species of Amoebas to survive. Only White people have such a low IQ that you have to coax them to survive and walk them through all the logical premises of why life is better than death. I can&rsquo;t fathom this.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>So remember White lemming boys and girls, the next time an evil liberal calls you a racist, just brush it off and say, &#8220;Ahhhhh &hellip; racism, schmacism&#8221; &#8216;cause we&rsquo;re all racists now.</p>
<p>I highly recommend <i>Racism, Schmacism</i> for use on the sheepie masses.</p>

		<p>There is no &#8220;Tea Party&#8221; . It&rsquo;s a media invention, with a heavy dose of promo from the Hannity-Limbaugh wing desirous of a new topic to promote their popularity and audience. What state have tea parties achieved ballot access?  Where do they differ with most influential conservative &#8220;mainstream&#8221; group, the GOP Republican Study Group in the US House of Representatives (Bachmann, Cantor etc.)? With the opportunistic and hypocritical &#8220;Newt&#8221; I AM A FAMILY MAN Gingrich? </p>
<p>When will the &#8220;Tea Party(ies)&#8221; call for an embargo on trade and immigration of kinds with China, India, Pakistan and Mexico and a declaration of war with Mexico for invasion of the USA?  </p>
<p>When federal handouts to the hospitals and doctors cease, and Walmart implements a &#8220;Buy American Only&#8221; policy. When Brown v Education and other court decisions forcing us to educate nonEnglish speaking illegal immigrants are reversed, that&rsquo;s when.<br>
When all US troops are withdrawn from South Asia and Europe and redeployed, along with air power, to our southern border, I&rsquo;ll have a cup of Tea. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any John or Samuel Adams leading any of the misnamed new Tea Parties.   </p>

		<p>Dont be so hard on TP because coming out as a Racial Realist is detrimental to a grass-roots movement IF the race it largely caters to, doesn&rsquo;t show interest in self-preservation. TP is an ideological movement that just happens to be mostly White people who still lack this desire.</p>

		<p>Fellow Native Born White Americans</p>
<p>The racism charge must be thrown back at the enemy. Not only that, we should preemtively accuse the enemy of being racist for perpetuating an immigration policy that imports high fertility nonwhites into America with the intent of race-replacing the Native Born White American Majority. We must define the terms of the &#8220;debate&#8221;. This what Jared Taylor, Peter Brimelow and James Edwards must start doing. Go on the attack!!!! It is the most effective and devasting way to fight back against  the race-replacement enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Force the enemy to debste the race-replacement issue every single time you enounter them.</p>

		<p>The problem with the tea party, or whites, standing up to these bullies in the gubmit and media is that they control the airwaves and most of the discussion.  as soon as a white man stands up for himself, see Ron Paul or his son, the gub/media paints him so thoroughly racist his credibility is questioned by most everyone.  Notice what &#8216;they&rsquo; did to David Duke.  and many others, they label them white nationalists or something similar and it&rsquo;s game over&hellip;&hellip;  we haven&rsquo;t found a solution yet, I believe that is why the waffling happens</p>

		<p>Most of the putatively race-neutral positions the Tea Parties take on political matters  &mdash;  local sovereignty, the rule of law, low taxation, the guarantee of personal liberties,etc.  &mdash;  are de facto &#8220;white&#8221; positions. How much of what the TPs want prevails to any extent in the non-white world? As long as they pretend to believe (or actually believe) that their ideas are &#8220;color blind&#8221; they will continue to find themselves embroiled in exactly this kind of fundamental philosophical and political confusion. I wonder if any of the TP leadership knows, for instance, that Asians (the &#8220;model&#8221; minorities) voted overwhelmingly for Obama and hence for the leftist managerial/redistributionists ethos his administration represents.</p>

		<p>James Edwards is right on point, as usual-anyone who thinks they can transform blacks into conservatives needs to be under lock and key. Blacks are the most liberal demographic category in the entire population-90% plus typically vote for the Democratic candidate in presidential elections, and have for years. Anyone who thinks they can be transformed into a cadre of conservatives is pumping on a dry well. Much better for the Tea Party and the Republican Party to follow Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s advice and &#8220;Go hunting where the ducks are&#8221; and seek to increase their support among their white base. That is, if they are truly interested in winning elections. If not, quit wasting everyone&rsquo;s time, including their own. Their &#8220;outreach&#8221; program is the sure fire recipe for losing elections-it offends both blacks and white conservatives, and won&rsquo;t garner them a &#8220;teacup&#8221; worth of black votes. As Kevin McDonald noted, the Republican Party is the party of white people, and the Republicans can either embrace that fact, or die politically.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;You&rsquo;re a RACIST&#8221; smear is simply name calling, ad hominem attacks. White Americans need to get out of there safe, gated communities, get off the country club golf courses, get out of their comfort zones and get out there and learn how to handle being called a name and not back down, start crying, getting all scared and give up.</p>
<p>The best thing I ever did in my life was work as an 7th and 8th grade public school teacher in Brooklyn. My students were about 50% Black, some nice, most disrespectful and ready to terrorize any White person who showed indecision or fear.</p>
<p>I got called RACIST, M$*%&$ F*$#(, M%*(#% f*$*#( Racist most every day - and like boxing training, you learn that getting hit in this way isn&rsquo;t such a big deal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trash talk, and Whites need to learn how to take it and do this and we can do it.</p>
<p>My main advice is to quickly get off defense and go on offense. Feel free to get personal, talk about how ugly the guy is who is yelling names at you, escalate it and comment that the person&rsquo;s mother must be really ugly to have given birth to such an ugly looking Black guy.</p>
<p>If the Black person yelling &#8220;You&rsquo;re RACIST&#8221; is some Civil Rights &#8220;Rev&#8221; hustler, make a loud point about the fact that he/she doesn&rsquo;t have a real job and maybe he/she should consider getting a REAL JOB. </p>
<p>Always understand that you and our people are being attacked and there is nothing fair about these attacks - never back down.</p>

		<p>Andrew Breitbart&rsquo;s comment about Jared Taylor doesn&rsquo;t surprise me.  Breitbart is a primitive publicity junkie, far more interested in fame, money and deracinated &#8220;culture war.&#8221;  From the start, he&rsquo;s defined himself solely by hatred of liberalism, ever parsing his words so as to avoid giving any hint of &#8220;racism,&#8221; lest the Left use it against conservatives.  </p>
<p>Basically, Breitbart is a fat male Ann Coulter.  He comes off as a slacker who tried out for the part that Jeff Bridges played in &#8220;The Big Lebowski.&#8221;  Don&rsquo;t be offended that he used the word &#8220;despicable.&#8221;  He always uses it.  He should have patented it. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to answer accusations of &#8220;racism,&#8221; from Minorities, but how about this response?</p>
<p>Ask them if they love Whites (or Arabs or Italians) more than their own race.  Stay on the attack   &mdash;   make it about them and THEIR behavior.  If they refuse to answer or if they give diffuse answers, keep at it.  Don&rsquo;t let up.  If they say &#8220;I love all races equally,&#8221; then ask them why they married or socialize primarily within their race or why they are members of NAACP or La Raza, instead of joining the the Italian-American Cultural Society, or the Palestinian Club. Ask them, &#8220;Why do you dislike Italians or Arabs.&#8221;  What have you done to help Italians?&#8221;  &#8220;Why do you refuse to help Italians?&#8221;  Keep them talking about them   &mdash;   keep the topic their beliefs. </p>
<p>Throw it back in their face.  If they are members of NAACP, or married a Black, or socialize with Blacks, then they obviously prefer Blacks over Whites, and are therefore racist!  </p>
<p>If they are concerned with primarily Minority topics, but not concerned with the welfare of Italians, then they are obviously racist.    </p>

		<p>The Tea Party accomplishes nothing if they come out openly on the race issue.  The problem is too many whites still will attack their own for just that sliver of moral superiority of calling other whites &#8220;racist&#8221;.  They haven&rsquo;t experienced racial hatred towards themselves (yet) to any significant degree.  So race realists need to go underground in politics.  Hide their views, infiltrate, get elected and wait for the day they control most of the government.</p>
<p>This is EXACTLY where the communist left was when they adopted Saul Alinsky.  As the election of Obama, Reid, Pelosi, Frank etc. show, they made quite a bit of advancement despite holding views only the tiniest fringe in America were not hostile towards.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s crop of communists have two problems.  The first is their ideas are outside the best interest of just about everyone.  Any exposure of what they are doing causes resistance.  Tough to run a government completely in the shadows.  The second is they can&rsquo;t keep their mouths shut.  They simply cannot resist shouting to the rooftops&hellip;.yes&hellip;.I&rsquo;m a communist&hellip;.I&rsquo;m anti-white genocidal sociopath and I&rsquo;m proud of it&hellip;.and I&rsquo;M IN OFFICE!  Look at me, I&rsquo;m subverting the system from within.</p>
<p>The guys on top may be sinister, brilliant world destroyers but their underlings are losers with a big L.  Also, it seems to me that they&rsquo;ve become so fed up with these losers that they&rsquo;ve walked away from them.  Obama&rsquo;s behavior seems chaotic and lipshod recently&hellip;.saying and doing all the wrong things.  The guy who writes for his teleprompter seems to have&hellip;.quit.</p>
<p>Awakened whites need to emulate the left and quietly take over from within.  You do not shout about some minor incident of racism against whites.  You get elected, look over the lists of employees and fire those who either are doing this or have a high risk of doing this.  The first gets you 15 minute of fame as the networks denounce you for every unreasonable thing they can think of.  The latter eventually gets you the ability to liquidate those networks and replace them with pro-white ones.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be stupid.  Don&rsquo;t be like the communists.  Don&rsquo;t go shouting &#8220;White Power White Power White Power&#8221; when you get elected as the town dogcatcher.</p>

		<p>What I&rsquo;ve noticed over the decades is that we have experienced in the West a fundamental destruction of the culture that made White people the winners of history. That destruction was accomplished by reversing all the morals, standards and ethics that characterized White culture. Notice that left-wing fascists essentially see immorality as moral superiority, cowardice as courage, success as evil, failure as evidence of sainthood, etc. These, and other, false assumptions must be supported by a system of lies and tyranny if the left-wing agenda is to be realized. Those false assumptions and lies entered mainstream culture with the hippies. Before that, left-wing evil was a fringe movement rightly demonized by decent White people.</p>
<p>With the hippies, the culture was transformed, and you will notice that the hippies were proudly immoral, cowardly, shiftless, emotionally unstable &#8220;victims&#8221; and completely worshipful of the false prophets in the entertainment industry. They are the ones who turned entertainment into a religion and &#8220;partying&#8221; into a ritual of worship. In other words, hippies were the first mass movement by Whites to embrace the values of third-worlders. The Clintons are high-profile examples. </p>
<p>That deeply-stupid, corrupt, lying, affirmative-action President, Obama, is the end result of a mainstream White culture that celebrates self-destruction and evil. He is a symptom of a mass Stockholm-syndrome on the part of leftist White culture. In other words Obama is a monument to White cowardice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a frightening thing to make the decision to fight an evil, hostile establishment. For instance, if I openly stated my opinions where I work, I would be fired. If it&rsquo;s one thing cowards MUST do is rationalize their cowardice so that it reflects well on them instead of badly. So White left-wing fascists MUST attempt to enshrine cowardice into law. They have succeeded in doing so over the past decades. </p>
<p>What should we do? I don&rsquo;t know. White people are on the verge of losing EVERYTHING. We need to look back at our ancestors. One of the big lies of the left wing is that White people conquered the world beginning in the sixteenth century because we inexplicably and unfairly had technological superiority. That is false. Until the nineteenth century Whites were superior because they used the same things everybody else had in a superior manner. Tiny, tiny White armies defeated huge third-world armies through superior organization and courage based on their religion and their culture.</p>
<p>Beginning in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries a fragmented Europe at war with itself defeated the monolithic Turkish empire time and time again. European navies beginning in the late sixteenth century had no rivals in what we now call the Third World. The European advantage was through constant innovation in ship design, weapons, tactics and command structure as well as a proto-industrial approach to naval infrastructure. In other words superior White intelligence and cultural organization began to outstrip the rest of the world. It has continued to do so ever since in spite of our best efforts to sabotage our success.</p>
<p>The entire White world is now besieged from within and without. Less than a century ago we bestrode the world. What will it take to reclaim our inheritance? I don&rsquo;t know, but we better commence to some serious reclaiming pretty damn soon.</p>

<p>Nobody owns the Tea Party moniker.  That&rsquo;s the point I&rsquo;ve been trying to make for awhile   &mdash;   the TPM isn&rsquo;t a top-down astroturf outfit with a central HQ and a few vulnerable choke points.  Maybe a lot of TPM &#8220;leaders&#8221; come out against &#8220;racism,&#8221; but they don&rsquo;t own the tea party label, either.  You can organize your own tea party if you want, bypassing whatever milquetoast &#8220;leaders&#8221; you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>The TPM is like Al Qaeda in a way   &mdash;   Both are decentralized milieus of relatively like minded people with some goals in common.  The left (NAACP, Obama and otherwise) don&rsquo;t like the TPM because the left vs TPM fight is asymmetrical, just like USA Gov vs AQ is asymmetrical.  We fear that which we can&rsquo;t comprehend.</p>

<p>How is that possible?  How can we know when we &#8220;control most of the government&#8221; if we are all hiding our views?  This idea is extremely silly. </p>
<p>We need to openly promote white interests like nationalist groups in Europe do.  That is the only thing that has a chance of working.  American white nationalists have been trying to work through the GOP and conservatism for 40+ years and it&rsquo;s been a total failure.  They take our votes and our money and stab us in the back.  We need to build our own, explicitly pro-white movement from the ground up.  Give up on this idea of piggybacking onto or co-opting movements that are not concerned with race to begin with. </p>
