			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ericka Blount Danois, BV Black Spin, July 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the ongoing saga of Detroit&rsquo;s dysfunction comes Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy&rsquo;s bright idea to jail parents in Detroit for up to three days for repeatedly missing parent-teacher conferences.</p>
<p>Worthy&rsquo;s argument is that parents who are not accountable for their children are part of the problem with elevated truancy, dropout rates and a recent rash of violent crimes involving teens:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So if you have a single parent who is working and unable to attend a conference, then that parent should be jailed, which would leave the child completely alone? Are you jailing a parent who&rsquo;s a deadbeat? Or is it just the primary caregiver? What about someone with 10 kids and 10 different schools? What about kids who just have bad parents? Will meeting with a teacher make them better parents? My parents didn&rsquo;t make every conference for my sister and I, and I haven&rsquo;t made every conference for my children. We all did well or are doing well in school. Is any of this logical?</p>
<p>Under Worthy&rsquo;s plan, Wayne County parents would be required to pick a time and day to attend one parent-teacher conference a year. If that conference is missed, the school would send out a letter to set up another within 14 days. If the second is missed, parents get a letter about sanctions, which could include up to three days in jail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This proposal is unlikely to quickly become an ordinance because it would probably be challenged in court. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maybe Worthy should do some research on tactics that have worked in other districts with Detroit&rsquo;s demographics. Detroit really doesn&rsquo;t need any more people in jail. I mean, really.<br>

		<p>Parental involvement as an indicator of children&rsquo;s academic success is way overrated anyway.  Why are we to believe that low IQ black parents will make their low IQ black children do any better in school if they meet with their slightly above the black IQ average teachers twice a year?  You mean to tell me that in those 15 minutes per meeting sessions that some magic plan is going to be cooked up?</p>
<p>My own mother stopped looking at my homework after I got out of the 3rd grade, stopped giving me a regular bed time after I got out of the 3rd grade, and stopped going to PTA/PTC meetings regularly after I got out of the 4th grade, though she went occasionally when I was in the 5th grade through Freshman year of high school.  After my freshman year of HS, she never laid eyes on one of my teachers again.  Yet, that didn&rsquo;t seem to hurt me.  For the record, there were four PTCs per year when I was going to elementary school, two in middle school and two in high school per year; Detroit only seems to want one.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think the real issue is not enough parental involvment (I go to my son&rsquo; parent/teacher conferences not because I&rsquo;m compelled to, but because I care about his progress).  The root issue is race.  They&rsquo;re trying to deal with the symptoms and ignore the cause.</p>

		<p>My favorite line in the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;What about someone with 10 kids and 10 different schools?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a radical black publication, and the author obviously knows the ghetto culture well. The tragic comedy that is black &#8220;logic&#8221; continues.  </p>
<p>What these black pundits refuse to realize is that the average Detroit or any other ghetto &#8220;parent&#8221; blames anyone and everyone else for little Jamal&rsquo;s and Shaniqua&rsquo;s academic failures. If momma showed up for a meeting with the teacher, it would end up with momma &#8220;gettin&rsquo; all up in da teacher&rsquo;s face&#8221; complete with all the threats and screaming.  </p>
<p>They better have some cops on duty.</p>

		<p>You have to learn to crawl before you can walk. This seems pretty dumb considering most black kids are raised by their grandparents these days, heck just for caring for their kids at all you are ahead of the curve. </p>

		<p>A tiny part of school-teaching is reverse psychology, I think. It&rsquo;s not always about forcing them to learn - or the best technique is not forcing them to learn - the best technique is valuing education - by real example - and more importantly - having them Wanting or at least be willing to learn. It&rsquo;s something they have to do on their own, to a certain extent.  </p>
<p>Besides, everyone knows by now reverse psychology is the best way to deal with dumb girls&hellip; ?</p>

<p>Agreed. Parents can help their kids a lot by reading to them when they&rsquo;re young, but I&rsquo;m not really sure what good it does for a parent to sit around talking to the teacher. After all, a parent-teacher conference doesn&rsquo;t really have anything to do with the kid and the kid is the most important factor when it comes to how well that particular kid is going to do in school. Kids will learn if they&rsquo;re interested in learning. They learn what they want to learn. For example, look at all the kids who can&rsquo;t locate the United States on the map, but know how to operate a computer by the time they&rsquo;re three years old. And native intelligence   &mdash;   genetically determined cognitive ability   &mdash;   doesn&rsquo;t really have a whole lot to do with it, either. Blacks may have an IQ gap, but I think their real problem (which they don&rsquo;t see as a problem) is cultural. Most of them seem to have a total lack of intellectual curiosity and interest in academics. Those are all white things apparently.</p>

Low IQ kids won&rsquo;t become smarter, but they can get more self-discipline and learn to behave, and for those things, parental involvement is a big part.</p>
<p>Not everyone needs to be smart, but it sure helps if everyone at the very least made an effort to study and stay honest and law-abiding.</p>
<p>[iFor the record, there were four PTCs per year when I was going to elementary school, two in middle school and two in high school per year; Detroit only seems to want one.[/i]<br>
No, the only thing the article says is that one PTC a year will be mandatory.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think there is any way a law this silly would withstand a court challenge.  The &#8220;in loco parentis&#8221; laws that give schools legal authority over students at school and on their way to and from school does not apply to the students&rsquo; parents.</p>
