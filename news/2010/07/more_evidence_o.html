<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=180129">More Evidence of Justice Racism</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Fitzpatrick, WorldNetDaily, July 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two former U.S. Department of Justice attorneys have corroborated key elements of the explosive allegations by a third former attorney that the Voting Section of the DOJ&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division is refusing to enforce the law against black defendants.</p>
<p>On July 6, former DOJ attorney J. Christian Adams testified before the U.S. Civil Rights Commission that the Voting Section is dominated by a &#8220;culture of hostility&#8221; toward bringing cases against blacks and other minorities who violate voting-rights laws.</p>
<p>One of Adams&rsquo; DOJ colleagues, former Voting Section trial attorney Hans A. von Spakovsky, told WND he saw Adams was being attacked in the media for lack of corroboration. He said he knew Adams was telling the truth, so he decided on his own to step forward.</p>
<p>In an affidavit dated yesterday, von Spakovsky stated, &#8220;I can confirm from my own experience as a career lawyer that there was a dominant attitude within the Division and the Voting Section of hostility towards the race-neutral enforcement of voting-rights law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Von Spakovsky also asked another old colleague, former DOJ Special Counsel for Voting Matters Karl S. Bowers Jr., to go on the record. Bowers is now in private practice in South Carolina.</p>
<p>In his own affidavit, Bowers stated: &#8220;In my experience, there was a pervasive culture in the Civil Rights Division and within the Voting Section of apathy and in some cases outright hostility towards race-neutral enforcement of voting-rights laws among large segments of career attorneys.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his affidavit, von Spakovsky, now a Senior Legal Fellow in the Center for Legal &amp; Judicial Studies at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., backed up Adams&rsquo; testimony that Voting Section staff lawyers were harassed by their colleagues for working on a case brought against a black activist.</p>
<p>According to von Spakovsky, former Voting Section Chief Christopher Coates was harassed &#8220;over his work on the Brown case because they did not believe that the Justice Department should file any lawsuit under the Voting Rights Act against black defendants, no matter how egregious their violations of the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Von Spakovsky also confirmed Adams&rsquo; allegations that the DOJ has brought &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of cases against white defendants but only two cases against black defendants. He agreed with Adams that DOJ&rsquo;s dismissal of most charges in one of the cases after the Obama administration took over in 2009, the New Black Panther Party voter-intimidation case, was &#8220;unprecedented.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his affidavit, von Spakovsky further confirmed Adams&rsquo; allegation that the DOJ is deliberately refusing to enforce Section 8 of the National Voter Registration Act, widely known as the &#8220;Motor Voter&#8221; law. Section 8 requires state and local election officials to remove ineligible voters from voter lists.</p>
<p>According to Adams, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Julie Fernandes, an Obama appointee, told Voting Section employees the department &#8220;has no interest in enforcing&#8221; Section 8 because &#8220;it has nothing to do with increasing turnout.&#8221;</p>
<p>Von Spakovsky told WND the administration&rsquo;s refusal to enforce Section 8 is politically motivated.</p>
<p>&#8220;The left doesn&rsquo;t like Section 8, because they want as many people on the rolls as possible, even if they&rsquo;re ineligible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Von Spakovsky contended that enough ineligible felons voted in Minnesota to catapult the Democratic candidate, comedian Al Franken, to victory in the razor-thin 2008 U.S. Senate race.</p>
<p>Adams, now a PajamasMedia blogger, alleged in a blog post yesterday: &#8220;The Department is not allowing Christopher Coates to comply with his subpoena [from the U.S. Civil Rights Commission]. These two affidavits give you an abbreviated understanding about why that is. If he were permitted to appear and tell the truth, the lid blows off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Von Spakovsky said the DOJ was placing Coates in an &#8220;untenable&#8221; position by ordering him not to comply with the subpoena, forcing him to choose between exposing himself to legal jeopardy and keeping his job.</p>

<p>The reason they want them on the rolls is that corrupt black and Hispanic poll workers will cast votes in their names after hours, even if the people themselves actually don&rsquo;t come out to vote.  I would be willing to bet that&rsquo;s how most of those FrakenFelons &#8220;cast&#8221; their votes.</p>

		<p>Blacks are taught that their job is to get back what Whitey done stole from dem.  Why should we expect that blacks in power will suddenly become altruistic and blind arbiters of Justice?  They are tribal warriors.  We must admit that, and teach our children and White politicians to admit it and prepare to defend against it.</p>
<p>Example of typical educated black thinking, which is used to justify despotism against Whites:</p>
<p><br>
http://www.dailyemerald.com/opinion/lebron-backlash-overlooks-race-1.1499197</p>
<p>Wealth, during slavery, was passed down through the hands of whites, while black slaves worked and built the foundation of the country for no pay. Despite accomplishments of individuals such as Barack Obama, whites still pull the strings in virtually all positions of power and influence in this country, and that is a direct result of the white privilege created by wealth exclusively passed down through white hands.<br>

		<p>Throughout my life, I&rsquo;ve heard whites say that this would happen if blacks came to national power.  I would have thought blacks would be more subtle about it until  &mdash;  and only if  &mdash;  they managed to consolidate enough power to prevent a tremendous backlash from whites.  But, it appears that in true ghetto fashion, impatience and eagerness for payback has won the day.  Whites still have superior numbers, so let&rsquo;s see that this never happens again!</p>

<p>I truly don&rsquo;t believe blacks have the mental ability to be clever OR subtle, and I expected everything I&rsquo;m seeing them do that&rsquo;s just plain stupid.  Look at the one from the Agricultural Dept. who openly admits in public she blatantly discriminated against a needy white farmer.</p>
<p>This WILL occur again, I&rsquo;m afraid, which will show the world why they&rsquo;ve never had what could be called a successfully black run city, state or country.</p>
<p>If this racist president gets a second term, incompetent blacks will be so numerous and firmly entrenched in their jobs, we will be at third world levels for certain.  And it will be just exactly what white voters deserve for voting for him.  Bringing us down with them is the true injustice.</p>
<p>These are VERY DARK TIMES for this country.</p>

		<p>All we had to do was look at Zimbabwe or South Africa to see what would happen. It doesn&rsquo;t matter where in the world you look, whatever whites have blacks want.   </p>

		<p>Does anyone have info. on the percentages of minorities and whites that are now hired by government agencies?.</p>
<p>I would bet that, that info. is not available.</p>
<p>So, those libbies children will inherit the poverty status that is now happening to whites in other countries.</p>
<p>I do feel sorry for whites in this once great nation.</p>

		<p>I am so sick of the out and out racism on part of blacks and assorted minorities and the silence(for the most part) from the &#8220;White&#8221; media and the White public! There is NO White outrage and listening to callers on talk shows only reinforces my fears. They are so AFRAID of coming across as &#8220;racist&#8221; that they would rather commit racial suicide than show any racial solidarity. Many even defend their enemy! Especially the talk show hosts!</p>

		<p>How does one ignore a subpoena?  I thought the Federal Marshals would be dispatched to physically grab the person under subpoena and march them to stand before the commission, and if he fails to answer questions, he&rsquo;s thrown in jail on contempt charges until he changes his mind.</p>
<p>Is this not how it is supposed to work?</p>
<p>Where does the DoJ get off telling lawful commissions to kiss off?  If a defendant against a DoJ action were to ignore subpeonae, would not they not &#8216;release the hounds&rsquo; so-to-speak?</p>
