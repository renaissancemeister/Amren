			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Anderson, Youth for Western Civilization, July 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This last week, Youth for Western Civilization dropped by the left-wing &#8220;Campus Progress&#8221; conference here in Washington D.C. It was held in the Omni Shoreham hotel, with the main portion of the conference taking place in an ornate ballroom filled with a massive stereo system and two giant projection screens. The conference was headlined by big name speakers like Samantha Powers, John Podesta, Van Jones, and dozens of other presenters and panelists flown in with all expenses paid for the weekend. At least George Soros isn&rsquo;t lacking for money in the Obama Recession.</p>
<p>All our favorite leftist archetypes were in attendance:</p>
<p>The advocates for the re-distribution of wealth  &mdash;  You know the type. The angry scowlers of the Al Sharpton strain who demand affirmative action and blame white people for black and Hispanic economic disparities, directing a constant barrage of eye-daggers at anyone who appeared to represent &#8220;the man&#8221;.</p>
<p>Illegal aliens and their apologists  &mdash;  They were there in force. Their main objective is the so-called DREAM Act which would give illegal alien minors the ability to become permanent residents if they go to college. According to these law breakers, borders and sovereignty are a thing of the past .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for Western countries. It&rsquo;s of course essential that Mexico, Honduras, Vietnam and all the other places these illegals hail from maintain their sovereignty, culture, and identity, while the United States is transformed from a &#8220;melting pot&#8221; into a &#8220;tossed salad&#8221; in the never ending pursuit for diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>The LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender advocate) legions  &mdash;  These were the most prominent groups there. We were unable to guess the gender of many of them. A number of them were wearing shirts advocating a &#8220;marriage boycott&#8221; until all states begin issuing &#8220;gay marriages&#8221;. Good luck with that.</p>
<p>Even the restrooms were not safe from social engineering. Each men&rsquo;s restroom was designated as a &#8220;multigender restroom.&#8221;  However, for the women&rsquo;s restrooms, there was no transgender symbol. Only females were allowed in female restrooms. The irony of this &#8220;discrimination&#8221; seemed to escape them entirely.</p>
<p>David Cho, the winner of one of the organization&rsquo;s awards, took to the stage to proclaim that he was an illegal alien. His speech consisted of complaints that even though he had gone through the California educational system (no doubt at significant taxpayer expense) he had difficulties finding jobs due to his &#8220;status,&#8221; which he felt was &#8220;discriminatory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We now have SB 1070 brewing in Arizona, a state that&rsquo;s sweltering under the heat of oppression, and we now live in a society which restricts young children and students solely on the basis of their status,&#8221; he proclaimed. This is the Arizona that recently decided to dismantle the speed cameras in the state, hardly a move consistent with &#8220;a state that&rsquo;s sweltering under the heat of oppression.&#8221; Left unmentioned was the nefarious discrimination against convicted felons, drunk drivers, and sex offenders &#8220;solely on the basis of their status.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although he was proud to announce that he was &#8220;undocumented&#8221;, and list the jobs he and his family illegally work (many of which are the type in which one is commonly paid under the table), no federal agents showed up to arrest him, nor is there any sign that any legal or law enforcement action will be taken in the future to restrain him from continuing to break the law. One can easily imagine this would not be the case had an American citizen proclaimed &#8220;I don&rsquo;t pay my taxes,&#8221; &#8220;I drive without a license,&#8221; &#8220;I sell marijuana for a living,&#8221; or any other proud announcement of ongoing and purposeful law violation. Rather than living &#8220;in the shadows,&#8221; criminals like Cho can flaunt their illegal status confidently because they know they have the American Establishment on their side.</p>
<p>David Cho has high ambitions for someone who isn&rsquo;t even an American citizen: &#8220;I ultimately want to become a U.S. Senator, because I want to make changes in this country,&#8221; he announced. Of course, we want to make changes too, though probably something far removed from the kind of &#8220;Change&#8221; we&rsquo;ve been suffering through the last two years. Cho concluded, &#8220;Let us rededicate ourselves to the commitment and the involvement in the common effort to create a new society, and a new nation.&#8221;  One wonders who this &#8220;us&#8221; is, what &#8220;new nation&#8221; he wants to create, and why he has to do it here. As Americans, we generally like the nation we have now and don&rsquo;t want it to be replaced.</p>
<p>The various sessions on specific issues were predictable. Granting amnesty to illegal aliens was the subject of one of the morning sessions, entitled &#8220;Out of the Shadows, Into the Streets.&#8221; The main argument put forth by this panel was that with millions of illegal aliens leeching off the institutions and taxpayers of our republic, &#8220;it only makes sense&#8221; to give them citizenship. As stated above, their foremost goal is the ludicrously named DREAM Act, which would give young adults illegally residing in the United States the opportunity for permanent residency. Americans who do not have access to a college education or law abiding immigrants who are trying to obtain permanent residency would be ignored. One of the requirements for the law would be &#8220;good moral character.&#8221;  Voluntary deportation and legal entry into the immigration process would be a good test of that, but we are pretty sure that&rsquo;s not what the panel meant.</p>
<p>The mantra of &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; was everywhere at the event, even in areas seemingly entirely unrelated. For example, another morning panel we attended on &#8220;The Force of Food&#8221; was ostensibly organized to discuss organic and sustainable food movements. A number of YWC members and supporters have recently become intrigued with ideas about backyard gardens and getting away from corporate-produced, processed food (which often relies on huge numbers of illegal workers to produce). Therefore, we actually expected some practical help from this panel. Instead, rather than advice on how to build and organize such movements, the focus was on &#8220;getting minorities involved.&#8221;</p>
<p>The panel centered on complaining that there was a &#8220;lack of access&#8221; to organic and healthy foods in &#8220;minority areas,&#8221; without addressing the underlying culture of this demographic that creates the market forces that generate this pattern. A self-described &#8220;Native American tribal activist,&#8221; Terrol Dew Johnson, complained that there was only one grocery store on his Tohono O&rsquo;odham reservation, and that &#8220;the largest aisle is soda pop and junk food.&#8221; Another panelist lamented that the supermarkets have departed Los Angeles, and the new tenants in these buildings are liquor stores.</p>
<p>The federal &#8220;Superfund&#8221; law which mandates clean-ups of polluted &#8220;brownfields&#8221; even drew a part of the blame, as one of the panelists said that McDonalds was the only company able to pay for such cleanups before building on certain urban sites. However, one would think that large organic and health food chains such as Whole Foods or Trader Joe&rsquo;s would just as easily be able to afford such cleanups, were there any demand for such stores from the people who live in these areas. Of course, since the CEO of Whole Foods publicly opposed the Obamacare bill, he might be persona non grata in the eyes of the extreme Left.</p>
<p>One questioner, who appeared to be a middle-to-upper class white girl, asked the panel what could be done to bring organic and healthy foods to her area in Philadelphia, which she described as predominantly black. She talked about how she saw no interest whatsoever from the black community in organic or healthy foods. The panel was unable to come up with any answers, saying that the process would be &#8220;slow&#8221; and could &#8220;take a decade or more&#8221; to come up with any noticeable shift. One panelist said that he would be speaking at Swarthmore within a few months, but the questioner replied that &#8220;unfortunately&#8221; she would be on a month-long vacation in France during that time. It&rsquo;s doubtful that the Eurotripping activist Left will actually be making changes in inner city dieting anytime soon.</p>
<p>One of the afternoon panels we was called &#8220;Race and the Recession.&#8221; The general theme of this panel was that regardless of the ebb and flow of our global economy, white people are responsible for black and Latino disparities in wealth and income. The most recent evidence was President Obama&rsquo;s stimulus bill which was supposedly intended for minorities. However, some of the money ended up going to whites. This, of course, is &#8220;stealing the money from people of color,&#8221; and &#8220;as a country of color, we need more programs to elevate the rainbow coalition.&#8221;</p>
<p>(We should note that because this was a left-wing event and we are quoting Leftists, the following paragraphs contain vairous expletives and racial slurs.)</p>
<p>Ironically, the other afternoon session which we attended, on the topic of &#8220;Promoting Progress Through Comedy,&#8221; was mechanical and boring. The one exception was a &#8220;joke&#8221; by Baratunde Thurston of The Onion that Mel Gibson&rsquo;s black friends must be a &#8220;pack of raping niggers,&#8221; which Thurston said he could &#8220;only say .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because I&rsquo;m black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Van Jones seems to have learned his lesson from last year, and like most of the major speakers took care to sound as mundane as possible. One who didn&rsquo;t get the memo was an individual of indeterminate gender named Andrea Gibson. She went on a few long rants, saying such things as &#8220;Our sky is so perfectly blue, it&rsquo;s repulsive  &mdash;  somebody tell me where God lives, because if God is truth, God doesn&rsquo;t live here.&#8221; Her view on supporting the troops was &#8220;fuck your yellow ribbon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although her time was expired, she decided to stay for one more rant, since, as she put it, &#8220;I can&rsquo;t get off the stage without being gay.&#8221; She ranted about &#8220;the patriarchy,&#8221; recounted a fit of rage from her lesbian girlfriend when she commented that she&rsquo;d &#8220;like to eat that checkout clerk,&#8221; and expressed her anger at people who do not want to redefine marriage to enable her to marry her girlfriend &#8220;but the fuckers say we can&rsquo;t because you&rsquo;re a girl and I&rsquo;m a girl!&#8221;  One of the best moments of her life was &#8220;the time we saw two boys kissing on the street in Kansas, and we both broke down crying, because it was Kansas .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we were born again that day!&#8221;</p>
<p>Another interesting speaker was Beau Sia, who opened up with &#8220;I don&rsquo;t need a gong to make my entrance, I&rsquo;m Asian-American!&#8221; and recounted a series of racial achievements and his pride in them, statements which would have been described as &#8220;racist&#8221; and  &#8220;supremacist&#8221; if they had come from a white person. He then proceeded into another tirade in which he described himself as &#8220;a developed nation jerk-off,&#8221; and rambled wildly about &#8220;saving the world&#8221; from some sort of apocalypse.</p>
<p>What do we take away from this? Campus Progress seemingly has little to do with generating solutions, even in theory, for issues like the economy, job creation, national security, health care, trade, or education. Instead, it is a collection of tribes united only by their hostility to Middle America and everything that it stands for. It&rsquo;s simply George Soros backing the next generation of Jesse Jackson-style shakedown artists and freakish exhibitionists. They have no solutions for America&rsquo;s future  &mdash;  more than that, they&rsquo;re not even trying.  </p>
<p>The next event being hosted by Campus Progress here in D.C. is &#8220;Drag Bingo,&#8221; featuring &#8220;the biting commentary of DC&rsquo;s best drag queen, Shi-Quita-Lee.&#8221; I think we&rsquo;ll pass.</p>

<p>8% of the White U.S. population lives in poverty. Whites comprise over 40% of those living in poverty in the country. The liberal mind is such a powerful vacuum of hypocrisy, self-derision and pretentiousness. It leaves nothing for those White children in that 8% who, despite their impoverished and dependent status, deserve nothing because, according to liberals, by being white they are undoubtedly living a life of luxury and white privilege.</p>

<p>Best part of the whole article. Non-whites have an image of America as a fundamentally flawed country (even though they want to live here) while most whites think America is a fundamentally good and decent country. It&rsquo;s this disconnect that we have to wake more whites up to, and the fact that no amount of concessions will ever change this. In fact, the more concessions we make, the more the anti-American hostility grows.</p>

		<p>One of the lessons I&rsquo;ve had to learn as I leave my youth behind is that most people do most things they do for motivations that are depressingly simple, and not really that cerebral.  </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s behind the far-left extremist fulminations of this &#8220;Campus Progress&#8221; rabble?  What is the common denominator, the simple motivator?</p>

		<p> Excellent article by John Anderson, well written, and giving us a fascinating   &mdash;   and revolting due to the content   &mdash;   picture of the campus Left in all its pristine slimyness.</p>
<p> The Left is so great at posturing, and screaming into the darkness   &mdash;   or what they perceive as &#8220;the darkness,&#8221; I should say. One wonders what on earth could have happened to these people to make them hate America, and White people in particular, so much. Did their White prom date stand them up? Did a White boy beat them out for starting five on the basketball team? Did they flunk out of college despite dumbed-down standards for minorities? I wonder &hellip; I wonder &hellip;</p>
<p> I also wonder what would happen if the Youth For Western Civilization scheduled a conference of their own, and were incautious enough to advertise it publicly? We know the answer to that, don&rsquo;t we, fellow AmReners? The Left would be threatening hotel owners where attendees were to stay, staging protest marches outside the hall, and trying to shout down the speakers and rush the stage. The Left wants freedom of speech   &mdash;   but only for itself. </p>

		<p>I just hope that the numbers of college young people who find out about Youth for Western Civilization and agree with much of what it believes is wrong with society keeps increasing. I have the idea that the &#8220;wake up call&#8221; for most white students won&rsquo;t come until the general collapse  of this &#8220;house of cards&#8221; economy finally takes place, likely involving &#8220;stagflation on steroids&#8221; due to the eventual demise of the dollar. </p>
<p>The reality is that until we have a counter-culture movement of young people to defend and support Western Civilization that is as strong as was the anti-war and Hippie movement of the sixties that the multi-cultural Left will keep chopping away at traditional culture.</p>

		<p>One thing this &#8220;conference&#8221; does not lack is diversity of goals. In fact, the only points that they agree on is that white men and Western civilization are evil. What else do oriental immigrants have in common with black Lesbians? What else do radical Envronmentalists have in common with Hispanic promoters? What do any of them have with billionaire Soros?</p>

		<p>Apparently the gays/drag queens declared separate male and female bathrooms to be discriminatory and demanded their abolition.</p>
<p>However the feminists quite sensibly objected so it was decreed that only the men&rsquo;s room would be unisex.</p>

<p>I disagree with this completely.</p>
<p>You need to understand something.  These people are sick and violent&hellip;..incredibly screwed up in the head and hateful.  But they are essentially sheep.  This event exists because there is big money creating the event and sucking these lost souls into it.</p>
<p>Disaffected youth are neither the problem nor the solution.  It&rsquo;s who is taking advantage of and manipulating them that is the problem.  There are reasons they don&rsquo;t do so openly but choose to do so from the darkness.  They are few in number and very vulnerable&hellip;.so they manipulate these people quietly.  Behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Two things need to be done.  The first is identify, specifically, who these people are.  The second is to redirect the hate these screwed up people have, towards these people.  Reveal to them that they are being used, by the very dark forces they say they oppose.</p>
<p>They will turn on them like rabid dogs, and tear them apart.  It&rsquo;s happened before.</p>

		<p>Thinking this was going to be an interesting and informative article, I began to read it with my usual sober posture; however, as I continued reading about the uniqueness of each group and what they expounded and so forth, I started to laugh. That&rsquo;s right. This is what it has become, a comedy. The author has unknowingly written a beautiful satire of folly. These silly people belong in a world of their own. I never dreamed that it would ever get so weird and bizarre as this. Maybe this fits in Europe, where off the wall stuff has been going on for decades, but not in America. No, not in America.</p>

		<p>White Man, remember that LOGIC does NOT WORK against liberals.  Do NOT be defensive, be OFFENSIVE:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re just calling me racist because I&rsquo;m White.  I have every right to speak my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White, you are racist against Whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone who stands up for White people is branded a racist, &#8216;racist&rsquo; is a scare tactic to shut up White people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Whites are so evil, why do all non-Whites want to live in White societies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All White countries are being flooded with millions of non-Whites. What you call a blended humanity is the GENOCIDE of the White race.  You are pro-genocide, the ultimate racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Use the GENOCIDE CARD!!!  Nobody shuts up faster after being accused of genocide, the ultimate act of racism!  It works!</p>
<p>Bring up the key fact that in 1965, USA was 90% White.  Now, it&rsquo;s 60% and dropping, this is WHITE GENOCIDE.  Use the genocide card; use political jujitsu against the Lefties. <br>

		<p>I really say the following based on decades of life experience, in academia, in professional life, and as a thoughtful observer of our human condition: I see these things in people very close to me, and there is a very common thread. It&rsquo;s with no pleasure that I write this:</p>
<p>This group, as are a great number of leftists, are HIGHLY disproportionately represented by folks with unfortunate psychiatric conditions. </p>
<p>While bipolar disorder, personality disorders, schizoafective disorder, and traits which charicterize the above are all around, marxists and &#8220;outsiders&#8221; in the current cultural hierarchy ALWAYS contain a higher portion of the above afflicted persons.</p>
<p>They derive their identity from their alliegance to a nebulous &#8220;other&#8221;, which stands outside the mainstream. (Whatever the mainstream is). <br>
These unfortunates, burdened by personality disorders (or significant traits thereof); depression, mania, loose cognitive associations, mild to moderate paranoia and fragile, poorly defined senses of self, find a relatively easy ego-boost as a member of some vague majority of good persons oppressed by the powers that be. </p>
<p>Since the aforementioned outpatients have lived a life of exhalted victimhood (both because they suffered the normal insults and abuses of growing up poorly due to frailty, and because of warped and sometimes delusional concepts of self, and the world), They are ZEALOTS for causes that boost them, and ground them. They lack essential grounding, and lack very critical chips in the neural network of their identities. The mantle of victim, and savior of victims, is very precious to them, and they will fight like hell to keep it. </p>
<p>Try to shine the light of reality in their eyes, and you evoke very dark, primal fears in them. They lash out, for you are now threatening their survival-or so their amygdalic-controlled brains sense. They are often  very intelligent, and compotent in every day affairs, as a lot of very unhappy people are. They are functional, but their private worlds and relationships are wracked with irrational levels of DRAMA, DRAMA, DRAMA. <br>
They will NEVER BE STABLE.<br>
We are all &#8220;damaged goods&#8221;. Everybody got hurt, sometimes in small ways, sometimes in terrible ways. But these people were damaged to the core, for they lacked the essential ego defenses that would have allowed them to adapt to the vicissitudes of being a human. They may have been genetically challenged, and they may have lacked sufficient parental support (i.e: loving but grounded, firm, rational).<br>
 People get fondled, abused, mistreated, raped, bullied, etc. Sad, but true. The uber-marxists have a very high percentage among them who could not rise above the abuses of the formative years, and they dwell forever in the realm of glorious victimhood-and with the attendant denial of reality about  personal responsibility..the responsibility every living organism has for rising above pain and misfortune. You float or you sink. They support eachother in a disordered union of misfits, exhalting themselves in that role.<br>
That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re so tennacious. Good luck trying to change them.<br>
SInce Westerners and even Asians are rather an orderly lot, and value societal order and cohesion, they don&rsquo;t openly freak out like third worlders do..thus the neuroses that lurk beneath the surface. Thus the elaborate defenses. Blacks are more likely to live a life of overt dissolution if they got a bad shake .Whites&hellip;agonize slowly over a lifetime, and keep a pleasant or at least sane face on the outside. Until they spout politics.  </p>

		<p>Read this article two or three times because this is the next generation US academia is producing. Yes, our colleges and universities are also turning out scientists and engineers (thank god - even though not enough of them), but over on the other side of campus this rabble of &#8220;exhibitionist freaks&#8221; is festering and plotting.</p>
<p>They rightfully deserve scorn and mockery. The inherent absurdities of the multicult need to be pointed out every time the freaks crawl out from under their rocks. When exposed to the light of day, they are a huge turn off to average white Americans. Good job, John Anderson, for exposing them.</p>
<p>Most of all, pay attention to what your kids are listening to and reading. These groups mentioned in the article want to do more than just propagandize - they are actively hostile towards white people and especially white kids, our kids. It&rsquo;s no exaggeration to say that the multicult dogmatists are trying to put white kids through post-modern re-education camps, through a post-modern cultural revolution. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on on today&rsquo;s college campuses. And you get to pay an arm and a leg for the privilege of enduring it as well.</p>

<p>The only thing I would add to your post is that these psychiatric disorders combined with uncompromising zealotry make these foaming-at-the mouth lefties extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>After I read your fine post, I was reminded of what happened in the Old Soviet Union when the Bolsheviks, who displayed the same type of behaviors you describe above, took control of Russia  &mdash;  unleashing mass murder, mayhem, torture, forced starvation  &mdash;  it seemed that the extremely paranoid Bolsheviks ENJOYED mass murder once they were able to carry out their sick fantasies.</p>
<p>Professor Rummel writes in Death By Government:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Probably 61,911,000 people, 54,769,000 of them citizens were murdered by the Communist Party  &mdash;  the government  &mdash;  of the Soviet Union.  Old and young, healthy and sick, men and women, and even infants and infirm, were killed in cold-blood. They were not combatants in civil war or rebellions, they were not criminals. Indeed, nearly all were guilty of &hellip; nothing.</p>
<p>In fact, we have witnessed in the Soviet Union a true egalitarian social cleansing and flushing: no group or class escaped, for everyone and anyone could have had counter-revolutionary ancestors.. almost anyone was arrested, interrogated, tortured, and after a forced confession of a plot to blow up the Kremlin, or some such, shot or sentenced to the dry guillotine  &mdash;  slow death by exposure, malnutrition, and overwork in a forced labor camp&hellip;Part of this mass killing was genocide..&#8221; </p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/22pvhbo" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/22pvhbo</a></p>
<p>Of course, none of this utter destruction unleashed by the Bolsheviks, NONE OF IT, not one word, deed or act of genocide warrants so much as a mention in high school text books, which instead concentrate on the evils of Western Civilization and champion its demise.</p>

<p>Public school system AND media.  Both have wrecked havoc and destruction on the Native Born White population of the United States.</p>
<p>Proud White Scholar writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;White Man, remember that LOGIC does NOT WORK against liberals. Do NOT be defensive, be OFFENSIVE&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You are 100% correct and it&rsquo;s time we started to fight back using the saul alinsky tactics that are used against us.</p>
<p>The only answer to  the &#8216;You are a racist!&rsquo; invective is an immediate, forceful counter attack, stated plainly and clearly  &mdash;  look &#8216;em in the eye.  Most of them wither away if you do this.</p>
<p>I have found that most of the non-Whites I work with in the school system have an extremely limited attention span  &mdash;  after all, they live their lives via anti-White slogans they&rsquo;ve picked up from various race-based grievance groups over the years. These anti-White slogans are entirely ingrained in them, and of course they cannot explain what the slogans mean (as many have low IQs as well, which is the entire point of using slogans).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found what works is a distillation of the talking points you mention above and in another post a few days ago.</p>
<p>&#8216;You&rsquo;re just calling me racist because I&rsquo;m White. I have every right to speak my mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t process this much information!  I distill it to:  &#8216;You say that because I&rsquo;m White.&rsquo;  &#8216;Give an example of White oppression.&rsquo;  &#8216;How are blacks oppressed?&rsquo;  or &#8216;You obviously hate Whites&rsquo; or &#8216;You are a racist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found short, declarative statements, said slowly, clearly and forcefully gets the message into their pea brains (and leaves them stammering).  They are also shocked that a White would deign to fight back.</p>
<p>But, as always, be ever careful:  As Anon mentions above, many are mentally ill and will lash out, blacks especially as they are not capable of an intellectual response and believe physical violence to be a proper debating technique.</p>
<p>And finally:</p>
<p>Tout le meilleur pour vous!</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>These people are a bunch of misfits and those who make their living feeding off them.  Many of them, according to the article, were gender-benders who  &mdash;  to site the example of the butch female  &mdash;  can&rsquo;t keep quiet about her sexual urges.  Imagine if someone at a Tea Party meeting had regaled everyone with a tale about wanting to commit a sex act on a clerk!  The MSM would talk of little else for weeks!  </p>

		<p>One of the arguments commonly made in favor of high levels of immigration by Asians is that, taken as a whole, their ethnic groups are a &#8220;model minority.&#8221;  Whereas Hispanics, Muslims and blacks are a drain on our economy and polity, the argument goes, Asians are different.  They are productive and assimilate far more easily.</p>
<p>I say let these Diversity advocates meet David Cho.  Then ponder the fact that there are many more like him.  Model minority?  I&rsquo;m afraid not.  </p>

		<p> Having worked my entire career in academia, attitudes like those expressed at the Campus Conference are by no means uncommon at today&rsquo;s colleges and universities. Many of my colleagues, particularly in English and the Social Sciences, are fellow travelers and ideological descendents of Herbert Marcuse. They are happily forging an unholy alliance of naive white youth, militant feminists, and angry minorities to promote their radical Neo-Marxist /transformational agenda. Like others of the Frankfort School they distrust and dislike the white middle and working classes and want to change society from the top down. What they desire is nothing less than the end of &ldquo;white patriarchy&rdquo;, or Western Civilization. </p>

It&rsquo;s with no pleasure that I write this:</p>
<p>This group, as are a great number of leftists, are HIGHLY disproportionately represented by folks with unfortunate psychiatric conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anonymous, you touched a chord. I hate to say this, but if my mother were around now she would be cheering the leftists on.<br>
She was anti-White, anti-West, and lamented the fact that she couldn&rsquo;t go out and &#8220;save the world.&#8221; She lived in a fantasy land. This lady was always worrying about the starving in Africa, the oppressed Blacks here in the U.S., my father was a racist because he wouldn&rsquo;t adopt a mixed race child, blah, blah,<br>
blah. She wanted to &#8220;save the world,&#8221; but she treated me and my father like trash. My father was just a low class Irishman and I was supposed to go out into the world and fulfill her fantasies of grandeur. She was mentally ill, truly. She suffered from depression, periodically drank herself into a stupor, did a few boughts in the mental ward after suicide attempts(nice mental wards, we were rather well off), and finally committed suicide when I was in my twenties. </p>
<p>Yes, these people do have psychiatric conditions, they ARE mentally ill. Objectively, I can feel some pity for them, but I can&rsquo;t forgive them for the damage they do.<br>

		<p>They are ZEALOTS for causes that boost them, and ground them</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
But do these &#8220;causes&#8221; REALLY boost them.  Do they ground them?  Or do they offer an illusion of these things that fails whenever relied upon.</p>
<p>Funny thing about borderline personality disorder and the related mental illness.  The way these people build up images of the world are &#8220;primitive&#8221; and involve &#8220;splitting&#8221;.  Primitive means they are simple, ungrounded and prone to sudden change and manipulation.  Another cause comes around and easily displaces the old cause.  Incongruencies are simply ignored (if they are noticed at all).  If probed, these people have an odd lack of details, when it comes to the &#8220;movement&#8221; they are involved in.  And no plans outside of BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO BY SOMEONE ELSE.</p>
<p>Splitting means that parts of their life are disconnected and not really a part of their personality.  These are also prone to sudden, dramatic shifts.  Spend any time at all among these people, personally, and you will find that they worship blacks some days, and rail against them in racist terms, the next.  Neither has much to do with whom they are or what they do day to day (other than go to the occasional conference).  They are obedient however&hellip;&hellip;voting the right way, when told to (who is telling them is an interesting topic all its own).</p>
<p>I am getting at something here.  These people represent the core of white support for racial enemies among whites.  It would be rather easy to manipulate them toward a different end.  For example.  Let&rsquo;s say that some underground movement were to start showing film footage of heinous black on white crime at various campuses&hellip;.not out in the open but as a sort of cult film type thing.  Juxtapose the sweet, lovable victims, white children etc. with footage from concealed cameras left overnight in Oakland or Detroit.  Over and over and over again, go over whites being victimized (even Youtube has plenty of clips for this).<br>
.</p>
<p>Sure, they&rsquo;re crazy.  But they will do what they are told (by someone else now)&hellip;.especially when it comes time to vote.</p>
<p><br>
Something to think about.</p>

		<p>Reference to 13-Jonathan: I would say America as we have known it is already lost.  Starting in the 60&rsquo;s with the moves towards liberalism and open immigration, we are now far down the path of national destruction. Given our location on the globe and overall population density though, it will probably be decades yet before we reach a point of breakup or of all out armed conflict. Yet, given either event, those citizens of some future White Nation carved out of modern day America will need a modified Constitution for guidance. The one we have works well, but will never survive the continued onslaught of our politicians putting their own welfare above that of the nation at large.  I&rsquo;m curious if any such efforts at a constitutional rewrite are being made or discussed within AmRen, or if such action would even be legal.  It seems to me though that if a future breakup comes about, a peaceful split would be better than one borne of conflict.</p>

		<p> David Cho, the winner of one of the organization&rsquo;s awards, took to the stage to proclaim that he was an illegal alien. His speech consisted of complaints-</p>
<p> So this Mr. &#8220;Cho&#8221; is in this country illegaly and he COMPLAINS that he is being &#8220;discriminated&#8221; against and &#8220;oppressed&#8221; because of his &#8220;status&#8221;. Well -  ahhhh - yeah!!! You&rsquo;re ILLEGAL you idiot!!! Must not be that bad though, I didn&rsquo;t read where you were going back to the hell-hole you came from.</p>
<p> David Cho has high ambitions for someone who isn&rsquo;t even an American citizen: &ldquo;I ultimately want to become a U.S. Senator, because I want to make changes in this country,&rdquo; </p>
<p> Where were these &#8220;high ambitions&#8221; of his when he lived in his own country??? What gives this idiot the idea that he has every right to come to OUR country and &#8220;change&#8221; it? Why didn&rsquo;t he try to change his country? Thanks &#8220;Cho&#8221;, but us &#8220;real&#8221; Americans happen to like it the way it is [ or rather &#8220;was&#8221; ] and we&rsquo;re fed up with people like you coming here to &#8220;change&#8221; it. So crawl back to your 3rd world slum make your changes there.   </p>

		<p>Obviously there is a master manipulator out there that puts together anti-American events like the &#8220;Campus Progress Conference&#8221; which promotes Marxism, social engineering, chaos, and is against everything that America stands for. <br>
   This &#8220;puppet master&#8221; feeds propaganda to those that are week of mind and because of their own incompetence, failures, and criminal activity somehow they feel America and white people are the ones to blame, not realizing that someone is manipulating them for their own personal gain. This &#8220;puppet master&#8221; pulls the strings of Obama and made sure he got elected threw manipulation of the media, fraud, intimidation and bullying.  America is the only country that stands in his way of global dominance and greed and threw Obama he intends to collapse our economy, put the U.S.A. in a debt that we can never get out of and drag us down to third world status.<br>
   This man is a true enemy of America and is worse than any present enemy we can think of in the Mid-East or elsewhere because he intends to destroy America from &#8220;within&#8221; like a cancer that eats away at it&rsquo;s victim.  As many might have already guessed this man of pure evil is &#8220;George Soros&#8221;.  If you do the research it will all come clear! <br>
