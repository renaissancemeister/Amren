			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Markon and William Branigin, Washington Post, July 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Justice Department filed suit Tuesday against Arizona, charging that the state&rsquo;s new immigration law is unconstitutional and requesting a preliminary injunction to stop the legislation from taking effect.</p>
<p>The lawsuit says the law illegally intrudes on federal prerogatives, invoking as its main argument the legal doctrine of &#8220;preemption,&#8221; which is based on the Constitution&rsquo;s supremacy clause and says that federal law trumps state statutes. The Justice Department argues that enforcing immigration laws is a federal responsibility.</p>
<p>But the filing also asserts that the Arizona law would harm people&rsquo;s civil rights, leading to police harassment of U.S. citizens and foreigners. President Obama has warned that the law could violate citizens&rsquo; civil rights, and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. has expressed concern that it could drive a wedge between police and immigrant communities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It adds that the law &#8220;does not simply seek to provide legitimate support to the federal government&rsquo;s immigration policy, but instead creates an unprecedented independent immigration scheme that exceeds constitutional boundaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Justice Department argues that the law would burden federal agencies, diverting resources from the pursuit of people implicated in terrorism, drug smuggling, gang activity and other crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The federal lawsuit will dramatically escalate the legal and political battle over the Arizona law, which gives police the power to question anyone if they have a &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; that the person is an illegal immigrant. In addition to Obama and Holder, the measure has drawn words of condemnation from civil rights groups and has prompted at least five other lawsuits. Arizona officials have defended the law and urged the Obama administration not to sue.</p>

		<p>I said before IBIWISI (I&rsquo;ll Believe It When I See It), when it comes to a lawsuit.  Until today, I thought Obama/Holder were entirely bluffing, to get Hispanic votes.</p>
<p>I think their decision to sue means that Obama/Rahm/Axelrod have already internalized losing the House at least in their own minds and political calculus for beyond November.  If they though there was a chance to save the House, I don&rsquo;t think they would have sued AZ.  Now, all Obama cares about his is own skin for 2012.  (As an aside, the reason I don&rsquo;t think the GOP will take back the Senate is that they&rsquo;re running some real turkeys in some real crucial states:  Pat Toomey in PA is a free trader, Rob Portman in OH is a free trader, Dan Coats in IN is an old establishmentarian, free trader and open borders, Roy Blunt in MO has too many Abramoff links, Mark Kirk in IL is basically a liberal, Carly H-1Borina in CA is the worst of all worlds.) </p>

		<p>If border security is a federal responsibility, then the federal government has abdicated that responsibility.  It gave up the right to claim it long ago.  Anybody know the legalese for &#8220;you are using your claim to responsibility as a weapon against anyone getting the job done&#8221;?  It&rsquo;s certainly corruption, like a police department that refuses to investigate murder, and locks up anyone who investigates a murder on his own.</p>
<p>The federal government is <b>openly</b> waging war on its own citizens.</p>

		<p>The White Amren Community is racially profiled through Affirmative Action for discrimination, oppression, and marginalization.</p>
<p>We must hold the federal govt. accountable for such toxic hatred that inspires violence against us from the non white extremists.</p>
<p><br>
If we are so bad that we must be racially profiled into poverty, then we must be bad enough to deserve a good beating at the hands of the Black Panthers.  </p>
<p>Extremist rhetoric against Whites inspired extreme violence against us.</p>
<p><br>
Telling White Southerners to take down the Confederate flags sends the message to blacks that Whites have no rights that need be respected, and thus we become targets during open season on Whites, which is now always and forever in former White America.</p>

		<p> The Fed. Govt. has the responsibility to protect the territory of the U.S., and if they don&rsquo;t, are we to simply sit by and let our country be invaded?  Of course not. There must be an alternative.  When the Fed. Govt. refuses to do its job, the responsibility devolves upon the state. And on down the line, to the militia, or the armed citizenry which is the last line of defense.  We have a right to protect our homeland if our surrogates refuse to do so.<br>
After so many years of neglect and abandonment  of its responsibility, we&rsquo;d be foolish to believe that the Fed. Govt. has any intention of defending our borders.  </p>

Arizona should force the US government to provide their enforcement records since immigration records have been kept. This should prove that the US government is no longer involved in controlling immigration.</p>
<p>By their own estimates, the US has a minimum of 11 million (though no one takes this low-ball number seriously). That there are at least this many illegals, you have the proof the US isn&rsquo;t enforcing federal immigration law.</p>

		<p>The state of Arizona should file a counter suit against both the current administration and the federal government for willfully failing to protect the citizens of Arizona and failing to enforce current immigration law. Arizona should seek full reimbursement for all expenses related to this onslaught of third worlders that is costing the Arizona taxpayers untold billions of dollars and destroying the quality of life there. The evidence Arizona could provide in a suit like this would be overwhelming.</p>

		<p>Candidate Obama made clear his intentions when speaking to Latino audiences (confident his media pals would make keep the  remarks from getting air time with the broader electorate):</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody in the Senate, other than maybe Ted Kennedy, has been more consistent in saying we need to have a pathway to citizenship for those who are undocumented, already here &hellip;&rdquo; (Obama to Univision, a Spanish language TV network, May, 2008) </p>
<p>The ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids on work sites employing large numbers of illegal aliens that regularly made the news in the last years of the Bush administration and that freed up jobs for American citizens were, of course, halted. Law enforcement must not upset the law-breakers:<br>
   <br>
&#8220;The [immigration] system isn&rsquo;t working when &hellip; communities are terrorized by ICE immigration raids . . &#8221; (candidate Obama addressing the National Council of La Raza in July, 2008).</p>

		<p>The election is not the issue.</p>
<p>What is going to happen when Arizona tells the federal government that they don&rsquo;t get to have a say in this matter.  That no matter what some piece of paper signed in some courtroom says, they will do whatever they feel like.</p>
<p>What is going to happen when the rest of the states see this happen&hellip;.see Arizona get away with it and decide they can do the same thing.</p>
<p>The republicans will flush the democrats completely out of the federal government soon.  But that DOES NOT MATTER anymore.</p>
<p>What matters is where you live.  Where you live in the US will determine what laws apply to you or if there is any real rule of law at all.</p>

		<p>Why?<br>
This is the most important question that even liberals should ask themselves. Why is the media and the government so angry about Arizona&rsquo;s new law?<br>
It is only one state, that doesn&rsquo;t make a big difference. And if diversity is a strength they should use white spots as a bad example to show what happens if whites aren&rsquo;t cultural enriched. It is because of the same reason why some areas are called being &#8220;too white&#8221;: <br>
They woooork! Actually they work better than any diversity area. And if the next state has criminal and financial problems they will know exactly what to do. That is the big fear. Such a place would be rich, have less crime, many lives would be safe, no more hunger&hellip;<br>
But it would make differences between whites and blacks. And liberals would rather have an America looking like Africa with civil wars, chaos and poverty than a rich wealthy America which has apartheid.</p>

		<p>&#8220;However, many immigrants may not be aware of the fact that it is a legal requirement for Permanent Residents to carry their Permanent Resident Card with them at all times. If and only when a Permanent Residence chooses to become a naturalised citizen of America will they relinquish their Permanent Resident Card and no longer have to carry it with them. Under the &#8220;Now that you are a Permanent Resident&#8221; heading on the USCIS web site, it states: &#8220;The Permanent Resident Card, Form I-551, is issued to all Permanent Residents as evidence of alien registration and their Permanent status in the US. The card must be in your possession at all times.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the(Federal) Law regarding LEGAL immigrants. Surely it is the obligation of the states to uphold federal law or can they go Obama and pick and chose whichever laws they like<br>

		<p>This a a very political unsavvy move on the part of Obama. It further alienates the whites who have been steadily moving away from him and his policies, even those who voted for Obama on the premise that he was the &#8220;lesser of two evils&#8221; regarding what has been happening to the United States.</p>
<p>With this, as an early poster mentioned, the Democrats are  going to certainly lose the House of Representatives in November, though I see them still maintaining control of the Senate.</p>
<p>Whether or not this is a shrewd political move for 2012 is still up for question, though I think the loss of white voters due to this will not be compensated by winning over of more Hispanics to the Democratic side.</p>
<p>All in all it&rsquo;s just further evidence of how much a counter-revolution is needed in this country to take back the America which was stolen from us in the 1950&rsquo;s and 1960&rsquo;s - and the Limbaughs, Hannitys and Becks on the Right are not going to be the ones leading the way when this finally comes about, but it will be more openly pro-white leaders who likely will never make it to the controlled air waves, of which Fox News is a part. </p>

		<p>The Federal Government enforces laws against murder, rape, pedophilia, hate crimes, counterfeiting, and illegal drugs.  Because the Federal Government is concerned with these specific categories of illegal activity, should states and cities NOT enforce these types of crimes?  </p>
<p>Should local police ignore rape or murder because those crimes are under &#8220;Federal jurisdiction?&#8221;</p>
<p>If a city or state cop pulls over a speeding driver and suspects that that driver has a kidnapped woman in the trunk of the car, should that local cop be barred from &#8220;asking questions,&#8221; or taking action, because there are Federal laws against the interstate-transport of kidnap victims?</p>

		<p>I, like Question Diversity in #1, doubted that Obama would actually file the suit.  And I do agree that he&rsquo;s given up on the Nov. elections.  I also wonder very strongly whether he&rsquo;s also given up on his own reelection and will spend the rest of his term sticking it to whitey and cultural conservatives in every way possible.  His action against the AZ law will almost certainly mobilize the vast majority of white Americans against him.  At least half of blacks and a third of Hispanics are also against it, and I bet it would be more if everyone really understood the law.  </p>

		<p>The Democrats have an excellent chance of retaining the Senate, but this may depend on whether Holder&rsquo;s &#8220;justice&#8221; department continues its current gratuitiously silly behavior.</p>
<p>Bank robbery falls under federal jurisdiction.  Is this Holder dope saying that local police do not have the authority to arrest bank robbery suspects, and that ONLY the FBI may do so?<br>
If it is illegal for criminal alien invaders to enter the United States, it is by defenition also illegal for them to enter Arizona.</p>
<p>I hope the State of Arizona simply ignores federal demands in this respect.  They could escalate the issue themselves, too, by sending Washington a bill for the enormous costs of dealing with the illegals and by witholding fuel and other tax remittances to the feds until the bill is paid.  I&rsquo;m also hoping for secession.  </p>
