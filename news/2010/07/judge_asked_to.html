			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Debra Lemoine, The Advocate, June 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The St. Helena Parish School Board is asking a federal judge to impose a 62.3-mill property tax to increase employee salaries and another property tax large enough to fund $27.5 million in school construction.</p>
<p>In March, School Board Attorney Nelson Taylor filed a motion asking U.S. District Judge James J. Brady to impose a property tax without an election as part of the school system&rsquo;s 57-year-old desegregation case.</p>
<p>In a plan on the tax request filed Friday in federal court in Baton Rouge, Nelson said the school system lacks the finances it needs to remove all vestiges of segregation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The white community not only abandoned the public school system physically, it withdrew its financial support as well,&#8221; Nelson wrote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During a May 19 court hearing, Brady welcomed the tax proposal suggestion and asked for attorneys to submit more information within a month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Taylor, the school system&rsquo;s attorney, said in an interview Monday that none of the parties to the desegregation case have objected to the tax plan. He said the next step would likely be asking Brady to tour the schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>School Board member Alton Travis said Monday he was shocked such a proposal went to the judge without going to the full board for review first.</p>
<p>During the June 10 board meeting, about two dozen parish residents came to protest the tax proposal.</p>
<p>An owner of a home assessed at $100,000 with a homestead exemption could expect to pay $155 a year if the 62.3-mill tax is imposed, Tax Assessor Wesley Blades said Monday.</p>

		<p>Money quote: &ldquo;The white community not only abandoned the public school system physically, it withdrew its financial support as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>St. Helena Parish demographics (via Wikipedia and rounded): 46.5% white, 52.5% black<br>
St. Helena Parish school district demographics (same source): 4.5% white, 95.2% black</p>
<p>How on earth this increasing taxes will serve the cause of desegregation is left unanswered. They&rsquo;re not even pretending that it will increase white enrollment - the only way to &#8220;desegregate.&#8221; </p>
<p>There comes a point where a public school district is so far gone, that putting more money into it must seem pointless to the white population (who, given those demographics, certainly pay both taxes and private tuition for their kid&rsquo;s education).</p>

		<p>For the first 200 years of America&rsquo;s existence it was unheard of- and illegal- for a judge to raise taxes; only the legislature had that power.  </p>
<p>Then the evil Civil Rights movement came along and several times in recent years judges have raised taxes to pay for busing, school desegration and other horrors. </p>

		<p>I am guessing this is mostly a black Parish.  So to end &#8220;all vestiges of segregation,&#8221; old black people, who can probably barely afford the property taxes they already owe, will have to come up with more, which they won&rsquo;t be able to pay, and therefore the county will get their houses.</p>
<p>Since when do judges have the authority to raise taxes?   The School Board really has no business, either   &mdash;    That&rsquo;s supposed to be a responsibility of the legislative branch.</p>

		<p>I want to know what this &#8216;charter school&rsquo; deal is about and why the school district is both seeking an arbitrary denial of the schools startup permission and why it seeks to pass taxes on the sly without participation of resident voters who have previously said NO to any tax increases, four times.</p>
<p>Given Louisiana &#8216;is what it is&rsquo;, it sounds like a racket to me.</p>
<p>Probably the best thing that could happen here would be to:</p>
<p>1.  Do a &#8216;rural achievement threshold&rsquo; probabilities study for this entire area.  Noting the racial and generational achievements of all families as well as the local economic conditions and services available to be filled by new graduates.  And from that make a yes/no decision on whether continued investment in public schooling is itself worth much to the region or the state.  As long as it&rsquo;s &#8216;fair&rsquo; in terms of equal opportunities or denials for all major population groups, I see no reason not to write off the parish altogether if they won&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>2.  Accept busing to one of the other parishes as a kind of economies of scale based concentration of state funds (and expansion of tax base, should that be necessary).  Or&hellip;</p>
<p>3.  Take 1/5th of this money, setup a remote internet site with one of the big university campus&rsquo; and do augmented home-studies.  I know that supplying every home in the parish with a satellite dish or cable feed couldn&rsquo;t possibly cost more than entirely new buildings.  And with smaller classes and rotating teacher/course availabilities from a (bigger town = more enthusiasm for teacher relocation) campus&rsquo;, you could probably get some serious professor or undergrad (assistants) scholastic competence improvement at the same time.  Treat it as a bonus-wage position.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t so long ago that we had to be flexible with &#8216;school days&rsquo; vs. farming requirements for things like planting and harvest seasonal needs on child labor.</p>
<p>I have no idea what these parish&rsquo; major industry is but if a home schooled student has direct access to mom and dad all the time, a good teacher once a week and at least EML to student assistants (which is all that actual college students have as lecturers and lab managers for many courses these days) for technical questions the rest of the time, I believe you could make the entire setup work for less than 15 million.</p>
<p>And of that, more would be going to the people who do the teaching than new infrastructure which is empty for a third of the year anyway.</p>

		<p>So, whites will be forced to support all-black schools, even though the students get more per pupil spending than the statewide average already?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t the black people support the schools if they want more than their fair share.</p>
<p>Sadly, I believe the judge will rule for the tax.  What will black people do when the whites are driven away to the hinterlands and deserts and all they have left are latinos for neighbors?</p>
<p>Will the latinos be kind to them and give them their hard earned money?</p>

		<p>&#8220;the school system&rsquo;s 57-year-old desegregation case.&#8221;</p>
<p>57 YEARS!! It has been observed that about once every 20 years or so it should be mandated for legislators to review the laws for re-writing. This case has been around for 57 years and is not fully settled? If not after 57 years is NEVER going to be!!</p>

		<p>Madison Grant #2 is correct.  Before &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; came along it was unheard of for a judge to have the power to impose or raise a tax.  Our real, Constitutional rights have been stripped away in the name of civil rights for blacks.  I see no reason why whites should be forced to fund schools that have been made nonviable for their own children. </p>

		<p>The public school systems in many cities have become money pits that don&rsquo;t serve the people actually paying the bills, who usually are the white middle class residents. The large welfare population pays nothing but burns up tax money in the form of free food, section eight housing, police, courts, jails, counselors, social workers, payments for bogus disabilities, etc, the list of costs is endless. The racial angle is unmistakable; working whites, particularly homeowners, are the cash cow since they are the only ones whose income can easily be accessed by the government. If more money is needed they have to go back to the same cash cow. Blacks and illegals are the beneficiaries of this largesse. We pay, they take; many people are getting wise to this race based system of income transfer. Keep working; the many millions out there need your money.      </p>

		<p>This parish could be given a school rebuild on a magnitude similar to the one in Kansas City and it still will not &#8220;eliminate the vestiges of segregation&#8221;. It is not an accident that only the absolute poorest white children in this area attend the public school system. </p>
<p>When you get to a point of 95% black and the typical salary for the schoolteachers is close to that of a 19 yo junior manager at a fast food joint, you be the judge. Not only has the train derailed, it has skidded down the side of the mountain, caught on fire and the local town has been evacuated. A little more money to rerail the cars is not the answer. The fact that most of the blacks in this parish don&rsquo;t have any money is not an accident either. Run up the taxes on spinner rims, fried chicken, menthol cigarettes, cable tv, and a few other things. This would be a little more proportional, demographically. </p>

		<p>Anonymous,  I looked up your wiki source.. i found this information interesting too:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;Socio-Economic Indicators of St. Helena Parish School System:<br>
At-Risk: 94.21%<br>
Free Lunch: 91.86%<br>
Reduced Lunch: 2.35%</p>
<p>The National Center for Education Statistics lists the following factors that lead to an &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; label for students.</p>
<p>low socioeconomic status<br>
living in a single-parent home<br>
changing schools at non-traditional times<br>
below-average grades in middle school<br>
being held back in school through grade retention<br>
having older siblings who left high school before completion<br>
negative peer pressure<br>
Students who are labeled as &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; face a number of challenges that students not &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; face. According to Becky Smerdon&rsquo;s research for the American Institutes for Research, students, especially boys, with low socioeconomic status (and therefore more likely to be labeled &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo;) show feelings of isolation and estrangement in their schools. </p>
<p>Minority students are much more likely to be labeled &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; than white students. In addition, minority students are more likely to be identified as mentally retarded. Drop-out rates are much higher for minorities, and the number of African-American students that are college bound has plummeted.&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p><br>
Looks like prosperity, hope, will-power, accountability and civilization left the parrish with white people&hellip;funny how that happens.<br>

		<p> A predominately black public school is a dangerous place where little learning occurs.  <br>
 <br>
This is partially because many blacks violently resist efforts to educate them and others.  It is partially because most blacks lack the intelligence to perform at white and Asian levels.  Consequently the curriculum has to be dumbed down so that most blacks can graduate.<br>
 <br>
Before public schools in Washington, DC were desegregated blacks graduated two years behind whites.  After those schools were integrated, whites, including those with liberal parents, fled the school system.  Now the DC public school system is one of the lowest performing school systems in the United States, despite being one of the best financed.<br>
 <br>
More money will not help predominately black school systems.  What they need is draconian discipline featuring the frequent use of corporeal punishment, and permanent expulsion for those whom repeated caning cannot correct.  <br>
 <br>
What will happen to them after they are expelled?  The same thing that happens to them anyway.  They will end up in prison.  The sooner they get there, the longer they stay, and the more harshly they are treated, the better it will be for decent people, including decent blacks.  <br>

<p><br>
Is there a law that says we have to support a system or organization when we don&rsquo;t wish to contribute to it?  Most whites are sick and tired of footing the bills for non-whites who hate us, have no love for our country, and do not respect our laws.  Why is this shocking to anyone with an IQ over 10 that people don&rsquo;t wish to pay for their own destruction?</p>

		<p>Well, the black middle class abandoned Detroit public schools!  Should they be specially taxed in their affluent white suburban digs?</p>
