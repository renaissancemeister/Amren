<h1><a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/07/race_played_role_in_obama_car.html">Race Played Role in Obama Car Dealer Closures</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William Tate, American Thinker, July 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Obama administration, already under fire for unprecedented allegations of racial bias, faces a new bias claim from a most unlikely source: one of the administration&rsquo;s own inspectors general.</p>
<p>Decisions on which car dealerships to close as part of the auto industry bailout  &mdash;  closures the Obama administration forced on General Motors and Chrysler  &mdash;  were based in part on race and gender, according to a report by Troubled Asset Relief Program Special Inspector General Neal M. Barofsky. &#8220;[D]ealerships were retained because they were recently appointed, were key wholesale parts dealers, <em>or were minority- or woman-owned dealerships.</em>&#8221; [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>Thus, to meet numbers forced on them by the Obama administration, General Motors and Chrysler were forced to shutter other, potentially more viable, dealerships. The livelihood of potentially tens of thousands of families was thus eliminated simply because their dealerships were not minority- or woman-owned.</p>
<p>As has been widely reported, the Inspector General&rsquo;s study skewered the Obama Gang for strong-arming the companies into closing 2,000 dealerships, costing an estimated 100,000 people their jobs during a recession.</p>
<p>But the news media has ignored key elements of Barofsky&rsquo;s report  &mdash;  elements that are far more damaging, if possible, to Obama. As we reported earlier in the week, a top Obama official, manufacturing czar and &#8220;Auto Team&#8221; leader Ron Bloom admitted that the dealerships could have been kept open, saving those jobs, &#8220;but that doing so would have been inconsistent with the President&rsquo;s mandate for &#8216;shared sacrifice.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Barofsky says the administration insisted on the closings even though a GM official told him &#8220;that GM would usually save &#8216;not one damn cent&rsquo; by closing any particular dealership.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Furthermore, a GM official stated that removing a dealership from the network does not save money for GM  &mdash;  it might even cost GM money  &mdash;  and that savings cannot be attributed or assigned to any one dealership.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as Barofsky notes, &#8220;ultimately close to half of all of the GM dealerships identified for termination were in rural areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is where raw, hard, sewage-filled Chicago politics came into play.</p>
<p>Records indicate that in 2008, Obama lost the vote totals in the nation&rsquo;s 1,300 rural counties by nearly 80%.</p>
<p>The Obama administration&rsquo;s insistence on radical numbers of closures ended up shuttering dealerships in those rural areas disproportionately, while dealerships and jobs in metro areas  &mdash;  Obama&rsquo;s geographical base  &mdash;  were left open.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} As Barofsky points out, the Obama administration was given an advance copy, and &#8220;Treasury [the Obama Treasury Department] might not agree with how the audit&rsquo;s conclusions portray the Auto Team&rsquo;s decision making or with the lessons that SIGTARP has drawn from those facts, but it should be made clear that Treasury has not challenged the essential underlying facts upon which those conclusions are based.&#8221;</p>
<p>Included among those undisputed facts:</p>
<p>* &#8220;[D]ealerships were retained because they were .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. minority- or woman-owned dealerships&#8221;;</p>
<p>* Thousands of jobs were lost, unnecessarily, due specifically to Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;mandate for shared sacrifice&#8221;;</p>
<p>* A disproportionate number of Obama-forced closings were of rural dealerships, in areas unfriendly to Obama, even though such closures could &#8220;jeopardize the return to profitability&#8221; for GM and Chrysler.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>The Chrysler dealership in my area, a longtime fixture of my city, was closed as part of the whole &#8220;dealerships closing&#8221; procedure, much to the bafflement of the city and the dealership itself, which was profitable. The dealership failed at its bid to sell used cars and so closed completely. In a recent ceremony, the former owners of the dealership were gratefully awarded the keys to the city where I live. The dealership was all [white] family owned.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a former new car dealer, having owned and operated stores for Ford, BMW, Jaguar, Suzuki, and Mazda, and also held executive positions with BMW, Jaguar, and Ford before going into the retail business.</p>
<p>While GM, Ford, and Chrysler had long-terms plans to eliminate (mainly through attrition) smaller dealership points with limited potential, getting rid of outlying stores had no positive effect on GM and Chrysler&rsquo;s immediate survival prospects.</p>
<p>Interesting that they bypassed all minority and female owned stores.  While women have generally been just as successful as men in the carbiz, the sad truth is that minority operators (blacks) have a grim history of consistent failure as retail dealers, just as they do with practically any other type of enterprise.</p>
<p>Just one more example of our Dear Leader&rsquo;s inspired intervention in matters about which he knows nothing, which would include practically everything in the know world.  The man is a Marxist ninny, rather reminiscent of Salvatore Allende, that moronic communist who utterly destroyed the emerging nation of Chile in less than a year.  Fortunately for the Chileans, he was overthrown in a military coup.  </p>

<p>Something tells me that wasn&rsquo;t the order of importance&hellip; </p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t Obama limit the sales of foreign car? Even Reagan, who promoted free-trade, put a quota on the number of foreign cars that could be sold in America. Obama could have saved a lot American of jobs and a lot of voters.</p>

		<p>Nothing new here.  This kind of thing has been going on for 50 years.  First government jobs, then government contractors then private sector jobs and now entire businesses owned by Whites.</p>

		<p>Not long after the auto bailouts, and these dealers started closing, Rush had a number of callers stating that their dealerships were closed (&#8220;theirs&#8221; meaning theirs or the one they worked for), and the common denominator was that the owner was a significant Republican donor.</p>
<p>On this topic, the Obama GM/Chrysler takeovers proved his campaign&rsquo;s fraudulence on the job outsourcing issue.  David Axelrod penned some clever TV spots about how a President Obama would &#8220;end tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas,&#8221; and ran them mainly in the rust belt.  Average white working middle class viewer walks away with the impression that Obama will bring back the jobs.  I saw right through the double speak, because the job outsourcing isn&rsquo;t because of a line on the corporate tax return, it&rsquo;s because of massively cheap labor.  But it worked for the purpose, winning IN, OH, PA and MI for Obama.</p>
<p>And right on cue, Obama hasn&rsquo;t even tried to revoke the tax breaks.  It&rsquo;s worse than that   &mdash;   Earlier this year, a woman called Rush to say that her white collar job at GMAC was being outsourced to India.  Rush, the globalist &#8220;conservative&#8221; that he is, couldn&rsquo;t understand the woman&rsquo;s frustration, but I knew right away that GMAC is GM-owned, and GM is now Obama-owned, and this was one job outsourcing that could have been stopped with a stroke of an ink pen.</p>

		<p>I am a white male, and the direction this admin is taking against us is overwhelming. If you recall, in Hussein&rsquo;s racial healing speech, he called slavery America&rsquo;s original sin. Being christian, I know the term &#8220;original sin&#8221; refers to the first sin of Adam and Eve. God punished them and all their offspring because of this. BHO&rsquo;s comparison to this indicates, to him and his agenda, that all white male offsprings of Americans will be perpetually punished, and its justified and needed. This man has scared me from the start. Any more info- don&rsquo;t forget the letter from DHS spotlighting most white males as potential terrorists needing survellance!</p>

		<p>This country is run like an African country  &mdash;  corruption.  The only barrier from being like South Africa and other black nations is because the whites are still a somewhat majority in this country.  This guy&rsquo;s origin and how he came into politics were all exposed to the public.  Yet, he still got elected to play president based on pure nonsense.</p>

		<p>These closed dealerships should be filing EEO law suits.  You don&rsquo;t have to be a protected class to file, the infraction just has to be race-based.  Most Whites don&rsquo;t know this. Firefighters have been successful lately using EEO to challenge the hiring of unqualified Blacks. Even if they didn&rsquo;t win, the publicity would be a jab at the administration.  </p>

		<p>This is beginning to sound like South Africa.  Remember whenever non-white racial justice programs are created East Asians are the ones that benefit the most even though they are designed to help black and Latino people.  East Asians will find out how the laws work and exploit everything they can.  This car dealership scheme just delays the inevitable demise of the black and Latino dealerships it is designed to help.</p>

		<p>This is typical Bobby Mugabe black thinking.  Take from the white man and give to the black man and all will be right in the world.  What blacks fail to realize is that a successful enterprise involves management skills, whether an auto dealership, farm or other enterprise.  Sure, some busineses survive despite their owners and others fail due to circumstances beyond their owners control but most require a level of planning and foresight that most blacks seem to lack.  And no amount of wealth transfer (or theft) will change that.  And it actually hurts blacks who might have made ok employees in a firm that was allowed to place them in a position comensurate with their skills but instead end up failed business owners.</p>

The biggest problem with limiting &#8220;foreign&#8221; car sales is that a large number of the foreign nameplates are made in the USA now. And you have a number of the &#8220;American&#8221; nameplates made in Canada or Mexico.  Limit sales of the Toyota Camry and you hurt American workers, not just at the Toyota plant in Georgetown Kentucky, but at a network of American parts suppliers that feed that plant. </p>

<p>Thank you for mentioning the SBA. Vdare once had an article that started out something like, &#8220;Do you ever wonder why all the convenience stores are owned by someone named Patel?&#8221; </p>
<p>The last time I was in New Orleans (pre-Katrina) all the tourist shops were owned by Arabs. Now, I had been in New Orleans some years before that and all the shops were owned by Americans, some Black and some White, but they all seemed to be from Louisiana.  </p>
<p>My husband and I have been in the retail business and it&rsquo;s known amongst small retailers that the SBA favors non-Whites and foreigners over White Americans. Prabaly all White small business owners know this. </p>
<p>I once called one of the SBA&rsquo;s so-called &#8220;business consultants&#8221; for advice. During our conversation I asked him how it was that people who don&rsquo;t speak English can get an SBA loan. After all, isn&rsquo;t a business plan a requirement? How can they do that if they don&rsquo;t speak English? At first, he tried to blow me off, but when I pressed him he admitted that there were non-profits that write the business plans for them. </p>
<p>A couple of more things I&rsquo;ll note here. </p>
<p>Across the street from our store there was a Chinese restaurant. If we saw two cars pull up in front during the day it was a lot. We have no idea how they were making any money. </p>
<p>Our business was located on the outskirts of a small historic town. There&rsquo;s an old building on the outskirts going back to Colonial days. It&rsquo;s now a Mexican restaurant. I asked our real estate agent why. She said they were the only ones who could get an SBA loan. </p>
<p>And lastly, in the center of town there was a Mexican restaurant that got closed down. Why? They were slaughtering goats in the kitchen after hours. </p>
<p>This SBA scam has been going on for years, but it seems that nobody wants to look at it. </p>

		<p>Mine operators say mountaintop removal supports tens of thousands of jobs and provides coal for electric power plants across much of the South and East. </p>
<p>The coal industry filed a lawsuit Tuesday challenging the Obama administration&rsquo;s efforts to limit surface coal mining in Appalachia.</p>
<p>The National Mining Association&rsquo;s says the lawsuit would free a logjam of 235 pending permit applications that have been held up for scrutiny by the EPA since 2009.</p>

<p>Unless of course the law specifies &#8220;under-represented minorities&#8221;, which excludes East Asians and usually hurts them more than whites. In fact, there was an article about that right here on Amren about how AA programs hurt East Asians more than whites.</p>

		<p>thirty years ago, just out of the service, I applied for a SBA loan. The loan officer who interviewed me was an off the boat Chinese whom I couldn&rsquo;t decipher. I was turned down. I called a friend who worked for a local Congressman. He told me that half the alloted loans were for women and minorities. The other half were for women, minorities and white men.He said that I didn&rsquo;t stand a chance. That was 30 years ago and we were still overwhelmingly a white country. Imagine what it is like today.</p>

Here in Central Florida, the Dodge dealership with the HIGHEST sales figures, Bob Dance Dodge, was closed. Bob dance(deceased) and his son Scpott are Caucasian. They now sell Hyundaissssssssss.

		<p>Someone commented that the obama administration has done much damage to White men.  Actually, the worst damage was done by President&rsquo;s Johnson and Nixon.  Nixon was much worse than Johnson.</p>
<p>Reagan, that great patriotic &#8216;conservative&rsquo; eliminated a simple federal government civil service literacy test that required those applicants with BAs, MAs, and PHDs to pass a simple reading and writing high school exit exam level test.</p>
<p>Because nearly all blacks with the required BAs, MAs and PHDs failed the simple high school type exam, Reagan got rid of it.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t blame Obama.  Nixon was actually the very worst President for discrimination against Whites.</p>

		<p>As a side issue but relavant. Where I live there is a 1949 Chevy, in original condition and still in daily use.</p>
<p>I was talking to the driver recently and my coment was, &#8220;From the days when American Cars were the MOST desired in the world&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think American cars have been sold here in any numbers since the 60&rsquo;s and the first shipment of Chinese &#8220;Great Wall&#8221; 4WDs are now in local car dealers!</p>

		<p>This not the only racist and despite it&rsquo;s marxist ideology,classist move of this administration.Cash for clunkers was distinctly unamerican.It is one the liberal media&rsquo;s many subterfuges that all poor people in America are black and live in cities.The bulk are in fact white and live in rural America.People that rely on used autoparts to live and commute long distances to employment.In the guise of protecting the environment and spurring growth the &#8220;clunkers&#8221;were shredded,robbing people of their benefit.Another thing,near me(MD)a closed Chrysler dealer,lain vacant,changed hands.The buyers?An Islamic group starting a mosque paid $2.5 million cash.Where&rsquo;d they get the money in cash praytell?Probably selling dope.Not good.</p>

<p>For example, as long ago as 1969, it was the Nixon Administration that actually invented racial quotas (the Philadelphia Plan) on the brilliant theory that it would punish a nepotistic white craft union. That would drive a wedge between blacks and Democratic unions!</p>
<p>Notice how that worked out?</p>
<p>And in 1973, following the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 1971 Griggs decision inventing the doctrine of disparate impact to benefit blacks via de facto quotas, the second Nixon Administration decided to count Asians (virtually all of them immigrants) as a separate race. </p>
<p>The Nixon Administration&rsquo;s invention of the entire concept of Hispanic &#8220;ethnicity&#8221;, has been particularly conceptually bewildering. For years, the Office of Management and Budget only allowed two ethnicities to exist: &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; and &#8220;Non-Hispanic.&#8221; But in the 2010 Census questionnaire dropped the word &#8220;ethnicity&#8221; entirely, and merely asked &#8220;8. Is Person 1 of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish Origin?&#8221; The Census Bureau gave up attempting to justify the Hispanic question with any sort of anthropological theory, merely asserting that this is &#8220;needed by federal agencies to monitor compliance with anti-discrimination provisions &hellip;&#8221; The Census also made the nonsensical claim &#8220;State and local governments may use the data to help plan and administer bilingual programs for people of Hispanic origin&#8221;. This makes no sense whatsoever because the Census did not ask about languages spoken. </p>
<p>These rationalizations are mere bureaucratic bafflegab designed to justify interest group politics. The power resides in the numbers.</p>
<p>In 1982, the Reagan Administration switched Indian immigrants from Caucasian to Asian so they could benefit from nonwhite privileges in government contracting and SBA lending. In 1991, the first President Bush signed the 1991 Civil Rights Act overriding the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision against disparate treatment. The second President Bush let Alberto Gonzales undermine the Supreme Court case against quotas in 2003.</p>
<p>Have these stratagems made blacks, East Asians, Hispanics, and Asian Indians eternally grateful to the GOP? </p>
<p>Not so far as anyone can tell. Instead, each move helped push the legally privileged groups into the arms of the Democrats. </p>
<p>Note also that, for the purposes of quotas and disparate impact, black immigrants and their children were privileged even if they were descendants of slave traders rather than American slaves &mdash; like, for example, Barack Obama, And preferences were extended to people of mixed white-black background as long as they were willing to call themselves black. </p>
<p>Obama suffered such (reasonable) doubts about the authenticity of his blackness that he had to write a 150,000-word memoir about his &#8220;race and inheritance&#8221; in order to exorcise them. </p>
<p>Yo, Republican Brain Trust! How did racially empowering Barack Obama work out for you in 2008?</p>
