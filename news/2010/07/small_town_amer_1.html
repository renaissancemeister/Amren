<h1>Small Town America Transformed by Somali Migrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Williams, Family Security Matters, July 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Newly arrived Somali immigrants have transformed small towns and cities throughout the United States into tuulas (Somali villages).</p>
<p>The process is underway in such places as Lewiston, Maine; Shelbyville, Tennessee, St. Cloud, Minnesota, Clarkston,Georgia, and Jamestown, North Dakota.</p>
<p>The Jamestown Sun reports that 400 Somalis have applied for public housing in the past four months.</p>
<p>The Somali immigrants in Garden City, Kansas and nearby small towns have created the Somali Community Center of Southwest Kansas in order to tap into public welfare programs. Within this section of the heartland, white Christians have become the minority.</p>
<p>In East San Diego, the newly arrived Somalis have created a Little Mogadishu. The streets are lined with Somali stores, shops, and mosques. In the midst of this ethnic enclave stands the Iftin Charter School, where K-8 students are introduced to Arabic. 99% of the student population is Somali; Arabs constitute the remaining 1%.</p>
<p>The American Somalis now display the highest unemployment and poverty rates in the country. They also remain the least educated. According to Andrew Liepman, the deputy director of intelligence at the National Counterterrorism Center, Somali-Americans face &#8220;greater insularity compared to other, more integrated Muslim immigrant communities, [which] has aggravated the challenge of assimilation for their children.&#8221;</p>
<p>This problem is crystallized by the present situation is Lewiston, Maine, where African Muslims, many from the Bantu tribe, began arriving in 2001 at the rate of 100 a month.</p>

		<p>Of the many obnoxious immigrant groups now infesting Western society, Somalis display the highest unemployment rates, welfare dependency rates, and crime rates. Even in Somalia, the men don&rsquo;t work, but rely instead on banditry and foreign aid.<br>
Accepting these people in our midst is a true indicator of how suicidal our immigration policy has become.</p>

<p>The Somali global diaspora in the West is a network of clans who fly to where the benefits are, like nomads drawn to an oasis.</p>
<p>What is distinguishable about this is that Westerners think Somalis are here to enjoy &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. </p>
<p>In truth, the Somalis don&rsquo;t care about anyone but their clan. A Somali can communicate with his clan brothers in Sweden, Britain, or New Zealand, and trade information on the latest benefits to exploit. </p>
<p>Like scavengers, they take as much as they can and remit large sums by wire transfer to the homeland.  We are simply the host, upon which they feed off and raise larger families.</p>

		<p>1, I have just read an article from a NZ newspaper about a Somali woman,<br>
accepted as a refugee in that country, attempted to hijack at knifepoint a small 19 seat aircraft used on a local feeder route. (Allah told her to do it!)</p>
<p><br>
2, I recently challenged my local MP face to face as to why we are accepting these people into Australia, &#8220;We have an obligation &hellip;&#8221; was the unconvincing reply. WHY do we have an obligation??? Here, the Somali refugees are basically unemployable welfare dependents involved in lots of violent crime. Despite their obvious poverty the Mosques seem to go up pretty soon as they take over a suburb.</p>
<p>Again, what is going on and why. Who is behind this insanity of &#8220;resettling&#8221; Somalis everywhere from NZ to Iceland.</p>

Just this morning, after 11 active months, I was banned from posting on the Buffalo News website.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t narrow it down to one post (I had enemies who stalked my comments) but I suspect it had to do with this article on a refugee relocation agency in Buffalo in which I was engaged in a heated discussion with a ly2323 and others:</p>
<p>&#8220;Refugees continue to find new lives here<br>
Journey&rsquo;s End aiding oppressed since 1985&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/25d54jz</p>
<p>This group brings in 40 refugees a month. In the article, they admit that some refugees will never become fluent in english and that &#8220;they signed up for eight months of welfare.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For now, Lay Ktray Htoo&rsquo;s goals are simple, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m going to go to school, and if I find a job, I will go to work,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Buffalo was recently designated the 3rd poorest city in the US with 1/3 the population being below the poverty level yet these do-gooders continue to bring in more people who have few prospects and are likely to a burden on the city (and state) for years.</p>
<p>BTW, in an act of intimidation, beginning in Aug, the Buffalo News is going to require posters to post using their real name and city (phone numbers will be required for verification but not posted). They are doing this to &#8216;promote a more civilized online discussion&rsquo;:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve been shocked at how seemingly routine stories can elicit comments that veer off into offensive territory.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The newcomers have shown scant interest in securing employment. When Renee Bernier, the president of the Lewiston city council, offered to hire 30 Somalis at the rate of $8 to $10 an hour to hold warning signs at construction sites, few displayed interest. The handful, who did apply, said that they were only willing to work between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.&#8221;</p>
<p>The people responsible for importing these people are as guilty of crimes against the public at large much more so than any Bernie Madoff type in the world today.</p>
<p>I just read more than a half dozen articles from various web sites, each one listing departments and offices in their locales that are being forced to close due to falling revenue, which will be even worse in the next fiscal period.</p>
<p>One article described how the police were going to have to discontinue answering certain crime reports&hellip;.as did other cities around the country&hellip;.with one that eliminated the entire police force and all government offices.</p>
<p>California is a good example.  It is on the brink of meltdown, and it has been forced to free several thousand low level offenders from prison to reduce costs, and the governor has laid off or reduced the pay of thousands of state employees, including police and corrections officers.  </p>
<p>Too, Illinois is wondering where the money will come from to meet their budget.  Many layoffs and government services have been cut with dozens more set to be reduced or cut altogether.  Of the 50 states 46 are on the verge of meltdown and they&rsquo;re getting worse, not better.  Speed traps for ticket revenue and higher property taxes are a drop in the bucket to closing the shortfalls.</p>
<p>Maine is at the point where it will not have the money to cover existing pension payments.  Will they still pay Somalis welfare so they can lay back and take it easy, as they go to college with an average I.Q. of 70, so they can be qualified only as maids and janitors?  The government is at about the point where California was a while ago, but, like California, they&rsquo;re going downhill fast.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s just one article on forced school closing due to revenue shortfall.  There will be many more.   </p>

Voters opt to close Palmyra school </p>
<p>By Christopher Cousins<br>
BDN Staff <br>
 <br>
PALMYRA, Maine  &mdash;  Palmyra Consolidated School is a school no longer after a lopsided vote Tuesday in which residents overwhelmingly decided to close it. </p>
<p>The final tally, according to Town Clerk Val Sprague, was 329-34 in favor of closing the school. The vote represented the final step of a process that has been unfolding for months. The RSU 19 school board opted to close the school as part of a plan to pare $1.5 million from its fiscal year 2011 budget, which is plagued by revenue shortfalls not unlike virtually every public school budget in the state.<br>
(snip)</p>
<p>&#8220;Revenue shortfalls?&#8221;  Yes, like every other state in the union, and the stimulous money, described by many of us correctly as no more than a delaying tactic, is running out right now, which is causing many state and local governments to hysterically raise revenue any way they can, while they&rsquo;re cutting departments and positions by the dozens.</p>
<p>Who will support these Somalis when the money for their welfare runs out and can no longer be replenished?  Will they take to the streets as in Somalia with their weapons and demand to be cared for or they will start a killing spree, as they also do in Somalia?</p>
<p>How man MORE of them will vanish to Somalia for jihadist training and return across the southern border armed to the teeth with AK 47&rsquo;s, bombs, and rocket propelled grenades?</p>
<p>Am I being too far fetched?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.  Not one iota.  In fact I think anyone with good common sense can see what is getting ready to come down.  In any event, we&rsquo;re going to soon find out.  The revenue stashes are dwindling down to the bare essentials, so we won&rsquo;t have long to wait.</p>

<p>This is happening more and more frequently. I also was banned from 2 different forums. This is all PLANNED to stifle any White racialist and any truths about nonwhites. It is censorship and applies only to Whites. You notice that NONwhites can say anything about White people and they NEVER get banned. That is the agenda to make us the foreigners in our own lands that we gave up without a whimper.</p>

		<p>Somalis are everywhere. They&rsquo;ve infested the city where I live on the Canadian prairies. The people in Ottawa used to think that third world immigration problems were Toronto&rsquo;s concerns, but thanks to the Somalis now in Ottawa, Canada&rsquo;s national capital is no longer the safe place it used to be.</p>
<p>More than any other third world migrants, Somalis move into those areas that are (were) largely white and free of third world immigration. Small town Maine and Tennessee are prime examples of this. These are areas that whites had probably thought of as places to retreat to from the third world tsunami engulfing North American cities. Now with Somalis ensconced in these formerly idyllic locales, there&rsquo;s no escape left. White flight is no longer an option - we&rsquo;ll have to get ready to fight.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Q:Why do our Leaders love Diversity?&#8221;</p>
<p>The unseen hands that hold the levers of power in Washington demand more immigrant consumers just as Wall Street financiers demand more debt. The two go hand in hand in the Ponzi scheme of debt financing.</p>
<p>Diversity is their way of ensuring we&rsquo;ll be fighting each other, while they send the powers of the state to play the diversity supervisor role.</p>
<p>At some point they&rsquo;ll try to equate white nationalist citizens with jihadist terrorists.  </p>
<p>White nationalists will have to sidestep the bait, and concentrate on political change at the highest legislative level.</p>

		<p>I get it&hellip; The white race has to forgo having their own families so they can subsidize their replacement. Whites create developed societies and then via  &#8220;compassion&#8221; surrender these along with their genes to their dusky masters. Is this evolution&hellip;..? I&rsquo;d love to be proven wrong by seeing Somalis learn what they see here and taking it back to their homeland, newly equipped to enhance&hellip; But I have a feeling that miscegenation, crime and welfare are more likely the outcome.</p>

		<p>Simply amazing!  Almost incredible!   If anyone had told us this 20 years ago, we wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it. </p>
<p>Somalis are probably the worst of the worst (I don&rsquo;t know about Papuans   &mdash;   we haven&rsquo;t gotten any of them them yet).   Why are they being imported wholesale into all white, western countries? They they, of all people???  They are a group with a culture of banditry and thuggery, a people with contempt for work and no notion of a work ethic, a people without civilized standards or culture,  a people with deplorable sexual attitudes and practices, a people with haughty contempt for other peoples and cultures,  and a people whose rigid religion reinforces their self-righteous belief in all these things. </p>
<p>They are far, far worse than Gypsies. Both live upon host populations. But at least Gypies don&rsquo;t have their own religion telling them that Allah gives them  his blessing and wants them to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll add that the people among us who are facilitating this immigration are beyond mere misguided fools;  they are criminal and treasonous!</p>

Matt, Canada</p>
<p>__  __  __  __  __  </p>
<p>So true. I and many posters have been saying here all along that there is no running away.  White flight is but a temporary defense, a stop-gap measure.  It&rsquo;s an evasion of reality.  It will give you a few years perhaps, but sooner or later they will catch up with you. There will be no place to hide. Everywhere you go, they go.</p>
<p>First, whites moved from the cities to the suburbs. A generation later, they moved from the suburbs out to the exurbs. Then, they moved away  to little towns and rural areas far from the metropolitan areas. Now, even West Virginia, Kentucky, Minnesota  and Kansas are getting their shipments of &#8220;enrichment&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221;. For whites, there is no escaping  this demographic &#8220;tsumnami&#8221; that&rsquo;s being imposed upon us.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse, our children are taught white guilt.  We are endlessly accused of exploiting them, abusing them, discriminating against them, picking on them &hellip;. when all we really want is to get FAR AWAY from them and be left alone among our own kind.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s getting close to being a criminal offense   &mdash;  - being among your own kind. It won&rsquo;t be allowed much longer. An unintegrated community of whites will be viewed as highly suspicious.</p>

<p>I called up those links you posted and not only have you been banned but it seems every comment you&rsquo;ve ever made has been &#8216;removed as offensive!&rsquo;  </p>
<p>Meanwhile jerks like ly2323 are allowed to spew pro-refugee sentiments and lefty cliches entirely without refute  &mdash;  pompously telling us Kulaks that we should be GLAD and HAPPY and EAGER to hand over our tax dollars and living space to welfare-draining people that do not belong here.  </p>
<p>If you disagree with this pompous a**,  you are a miserable, sorry wretch who &#8216;needs to get a life&rsquo; and should be volunteering to help resettle backwards, Third World people (40 per month)  &mdash;  people who he/she claims will &#8216;revitalize Buffalo&rsquo;, live where others refuse and take jobs Americans refuse to do!  If you follow this advice, according to ly2323, you will come to love refugees and welcome them into your midst.</p>
<p>I had to stop reading before I barfed all over my MacBook.</p>
<p>I thought the LA Times was a sorry excuse for a White-hating yellow rag but by far that paper out of Buffalo is much worse  &mdash;   the worst I&rsquo;ve ever seen.   Geez, what a waste of dead trees.</p>
<p>How is it that the Buffalo paper manages to stay in business?  The LA Times is hanging on by its fingernails (good) and doesn&rsquo;t seem to get that the final outcome, after decades of insulting its White base of readers, is its own demise.  Those to whom they pander  &mdash;  uneducated, Third World illegal immigrants  &mdash;   are illiterate in all known languages, including their own.</p>

<p>Exactly what is wrong with promoting a more civilized online discussion? For how much longer are pro-white people going to keep expressing pro-white views, only in an anonymous manner, on the internet? It is time that more pro-white people started speaking out openly, instead of cowering like cowards at their computer keyboards, using anonymous pseudonyms.</p>
<p>Naturally, if a pro-white person is forced to post on a mainstream forum using his real name, he will have to present his pro-white message in a gentle manner that will appeal to white liberals. When you post at Amren, you are preaching to the converted. But when you post in a mainstream media forum, you are making new converts to the pro-white cause.</p>
<p>Among the appeals that one can make to white liberals, is the environmental case against mass immigration, which is promoted by many dissident Sierra Club environmentalists. One can also make a women&rsquo;s rights case against Muslim immigration, and refer to comments made by Somali feminist, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who has called for reduced Muslim immigration to the West. Ms. Ali has spoken out against female genital mutilation among Somali immigrant communities in the West. You can also present evidence of the extreme anti-gay views of many of the Muslim immigrants in Western countries.</p>
<p>If a discussion of race and IQ is too hot to present in mainstream forums, there are many mainstream arguments that one can make, in opposing Muslim immigration. Too many Amren posters are expecting Jared Taylor to carry the entire burden, of making the pro-white case in mainstream forums. This is not fair to Mr. Taylor. The burden of saving the white race cannot be placed on the shoulders of one man. Given the sacrifices that Mr. Taylor has made for the pro-white cause, it is not too much to ask ordinary white people to post on mainstream forums using their real names. Of course, they will have to tailor their pro-white message to an audience of white liberals.</p>
<p>Pro-white people may hate white liberals. But white liberals are your parents, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, cousins, neighbors, work-mates, spouses, and fellow church congregants. They are your fellow whites, and you are trying to promote their long-term interests. It is they who are in most desperate need of the pro-white message, rather than your fellow Amren posters. But the message has to be presented in a PC manner, that will not scare them off.</p>

		<p>OK, so the Buffalo News requires that posters reveal their full identity. Easy solution. Native Born White Americans can start posting anon on American Renaissance and other pro-white alternative media. Bypass the MSM. Why are White Americans still reading and watching the MSM anyway? Bypass the MSM. The goal has always been to build and support an alternative pro-White media. Make the MSM irrelevant.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Yes, but what the article does not tell us is how this situation began. Why in 2001 did 100 Bantus begin to arrive in Maine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Christian churches that brought them to America originally settled them in the Atlanta Ga area.  But the Somali scouts discovered that Maine had much better welfare benefits than Georgia.  Also the Somalians had to compete with the very powerful and entrenched black Americans of Atlanta for benefits and affirmative action aristocratic status.</p>
<p>So they immigrated to Maine without realizing that the winter heat bills and car problems caused by the winter weather would eat up the increased welfare benefits.</p>
<p>But as the only blacks in the small towns of Maine they could take full advantage of their aristocratic affirmative action status.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed this trend in other online newspapers around the country. This requirement essentially insures that mostly positive comments will be posted and anyone posting &#8216;negative&rsquo; commentary can be identified.  There is even one newspaper in the Midwest where they even go so far as to validate your home address (a two week process) before anyone can post a comment.</p>

<p>I have very, very rarely posted anything on any on-line media form. From what I have seen, most of them are populated by the most idiotic, vapid fools imaginable, cretins who are simply beyond the reach of reason.  Rational discussion is beyond them. A complete waste of time to post or even read there! It&rsquo;s appalling to think that these are people who vote.</p>
<p>I did make a post a few weeks ago, on a Swedish website dedicated (of all things!!!) to the appreciation of wines.  [Vinfrihet]   Somehow, inexplicably, it had digressed off into a discussion of racism in Sweden, deploring (naturally!) Swedish &#8220;racism&#8221; and obstinate Swedish attitudes about race and immigration! You would think the Swedes are a nation of bigots, considering the scolding they got! It was the standard leftist pap lecturing us about how we need to be more open and accepting to more aliens, and how we need to be watchful and suppress any hint of racism that we find among our own. </p>
<p>As a friendly foreigner I wrote a very short post, merely wondering why there was any &#8220;racism&#8221; at all in Sweden   &mdash;   a country that until recently had no &#8220;races&#8221; for anyone to hate. I said nothing further.  It was up for just a few hours. When I looked back later, it was gone!   Apparently, on these websites you can only AGREE with the approved point of view. You are free to agree with them all you want,  but any disagreement, or even mere expressions of doubt, are not allowed to remain standing.</p>
<p>I think there are very few free-speech websites  which have a fully open discussion policy, without some tabooed subjects being placed beyond the pale. But how a website on wine turned into a scolding on racism is beyond me!</p>

<p>Several years ago the Public Library in Arlington, VA showed a movie of Africans in refugee camps run by charitable organizations, maybe the UN and Christian groups.

<p>The late Sam Francis can tell you:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;But why Lewiston, of all places? Because the Somalis deliberately selected it. Located mainly in Atlanta, Somali immigrants really didn&rsquo;t like the City Too Busy to Hate &mdash; because, among other reasons, local blacks harassed their children at school &mdash; and so they sent out search teams to look for a better place to settle. They found it in Lewiston, where welfare payments were even higher than in Atlanta. &#8216;The young men tell us, &#8216;This is a dream place,&rsquo; said one Somali elder. &#8216;They see the unemployment rate is low. There is housing and close family values like Somalia.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Well, no, Lewiston&rsquo;s family values are not quite like those of Somalia, and the Somalis know it&hellip;&#8221;</p>

A local issue that should be a warning to all. They Fiji Military Government, they are the bad boys of the Pacific because they don&rsquo;t have a democratically elected government. True, but Ethnic Fijians have been totally overrun and outbred in their own nation by imported Indians. At least they, the Fijians, have the guts to look after their own people.

<p>Ly2323 wasn&rsquo;t really one of the worst. I was stalked by people who called me a racist regardless of what I commented on. It was insidious (I&rsquo;m actually surprised I lasted 11 months).

<p>If you read the entire Margaret Sullivan post with comments (a big undertaking so I don&rsquo;t expect you or anyone to do so) you&rsquo;ll see the glee in their comments that &lsquo;the racists will finally be silenced&rsquo;. Scary stuff for anyone who believes in free speech and freedom of thought.</p>
<p>Everyone believes their liberal newspaper is the worst but the Buffalo News is in the top three. For example, local stations reported about a white man who was beaten and kicked in the park while rollerblading by a group of blacks. They tried to rob him but he wasn&rsquo;t carrying anything. According to TV new interviews, he was taunted with racial slurs. The Buffalo News reported the story with two paragraphs and the headline, &ldquo;Robbery called motive in Delaware Park mugging&rdquo;. Generally, the BN allows comments but when the going gets too heated, they disable comments. This story was reported without the ability to post any comments at all. The Buffalo News knew they couldn&rsquo;t let people comment on the racial motive of the attack:</p>

<p>I made many race and immigration arguments including on the environment and how women are treated and viewed by Islam. That only reinforced their views that I was a racist (The same with posting links to mainstream sources that proved my points). There&rsquo;s no way to win a debate with people who are mentally unbalanced (I&rsquo;ve said many times here that I believe liberalism is a mental pathology characterized by an inability to see objective reality).  Even when I posted mainstream sources, again, I was deemed a racist.

		<p>The biggest threat to white America is not stagnant population growth but lack of territory.  Every peoples, to defend itself, needs a fall back position that they can defend.  Without the British isles being British the British Empire could never have existed.  Without a place for whites, and especially white woman and children, to be safe the end is assured.  Why do the Jews tenaciously defend a pile of sand in the middle east?  Why does China flood Tibet with Han Chinese?  You have to have a place to call home to survive as a people.  The federal government along with assorted rescue agencies dump these non-white refugees, Somalis in Maine and Wisconsin, Hmong in Wisconsin and Minnesota, etc., into previously all white areas to make sure that when the collapse comes we will have no place to hide and regroup.  They want a fifth column in every sector of the nation to make sure we are completely powerless and subjugated.  They want a guarantee of mayhem if whites try to assert any kind of ethnic cohesion and defend themselves against their dispossession.  The feds want our enemies behind the front lines in every possible strong hold.</p>
<p>One good way for states to start ridding themselves of troublesome non-whites would be to refuse to accept TANF (welfare) block grants.  Do away with welfare for the able-bodied.  A woman who chooses to have a child or children out of wed-lock isn&rsquo;t poor, just stupid.  Rather than support these folks let the go to states that will.  It is no doubt cheaper to support the truly handicapped out of state funds without federal assistance than to provide state matching funds for TANF and TANF-like programs, as well as all the unfunded mandates that go along with participation in such programs.</p>
<p>Ban affirmative action as well as suits claiming discrimination based on disparate impact.  If an employer gives all job applicants a pre-employment written test and that results in, say, few blacks qualifying for those jobs, well tough beans.  If the same test is given to all applicants that should be enough to cover an employer from groundless charges of discrimination.  If the federal government intervenes through the civil rights division states should actively defend their citizens against the federal charges.</p>
<p>We do not need violence.  We need citizens and states to stand up to the feds, declare states rights, point out where the feds are intervening without constitutional authority and stand firm.  Ultimately what can the feds do?  Arrest governors and legislators?  Send in troops?  No, they can not.  If states resist federal intervention lawfully and without violence the feds become the bad guys.  The days of an occupied south, as during reconstruction and the civil rights ear, is over.  To enforce illegal federal authority at the end of a rifle in this day and age will not work.  It would merely set into motion events the feds do not want to see happen.<br>

		<p>In admitting immigrants, an important factor, which is not considered at all, is not just the absolute number of immigrants admitted, but also their statistically likely birthrate.</p>
<p>If you admit one Somali woman, who&rsquo;s likely to bear 12 children once she&rsquo;s here, and each of those will likely have 12 children of their own, then within the space of two short Somali generations, you have in fact admitted 144 Somalis. Multiply this by thousands of admissions, and the figures are astounding.</p>
<p>That, of course, doesn&rsquo;t even take into consideration the total COSTS to us of all those Somalis in terms of medical expenses, crime, social services, etc.</p>
<p>At that rate, they will soon overwhelm the small towns where they settle, and the costs of all this &#8220;diversity&#8221; will be enormous. The only ones pleased  with this will be the starry-eyed diversity enthusiasts (especially academics and clergy) and the politicans &hellip;none of whom will have to bear the burden.</p>

		<p>Bon, again, you&rsquo;re exactly correct. (I am always so impressed with your knowledgeable, well-written posts.) Somalis invaded the city of Clarkston on the edge of Atlanta, as it was already a crime-ridden international dumping ground with large local population of black hoodlums and druggies. About 2-3 years ago the exodus of Clarkston Somalis to Lewiston became local news, and it was widely reported, even on a national level, that the primary reason was because of newer, better tax incentives in Maine. So many Somali women were left temporarily in Clarkston to hold the fort and keep the kids in school while the husbands/fathers went ahead to Lewiston to secure welfare registration and a place to live that the number of break-ins, robberies and rapes of Somalis in Clarkston doubled for about a year.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;most interestingly, they seem to cluster especially around AIRPORTS! Coincidence? I have noticed  &mdash;  from Ottawa, to Minneapolis, to Seattle, and elsewhere  &mdash;  they seem to run the airport shops and taxi stands and baggage service. Airports are their specialty. After the lessons of 9/11, does it make sense to allow ignorant, backward, Islamic fanatics to monopolize jobs inside our airports? Did we really learn ANYTHING from 9/11 at all? If we had any sense, we wouldn&rsquo;t let them anywhere near an airport.</p>
<p>Oh!&hellip; but we mustn&rsquo;t &ldquo;discriminate&rdquo; against them! Heavens, no! That wouldn&rsquo;t be nice.</p>
<p>Our &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; are either truly stupid, or they&rsquo;re completely insane.&#8221;</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t insane but rather evil geniuses.  Their entire agenda is to dismantle the society by provoking general chaos over which we will be unable to exercise any control. They used their useful idiots among Blacks now it&rsquo;s time to import more 3rd Worlders from the toilets of Africa and the Middle East until they totally overwhelm us.<br>
Next they&rsquo;ll come for the older among us i.e. those who remember what the country was like before. They&rsquo;ve already started a movement OBAMACARE to drive Physicians out of the profession at least as far as it involves treating Medicare patients. Without treatment many more will die off quickly and the rest maybe will wind up in medical care complexes where they can be exterminated more efficiently by the Third World employees who seem to dominate the staffs of most Nursing and Assisted Living facilities. They&rsquo;ll perform the function similar to that of the Sonderkommando.</p>
<p>Sounds crazy doesn&rsquo;t it? How could anything like that occur here?<br>
Well it can because we&rsquo;ve been asleep at the switch. Anyway, How&rsquo;bout those Lakers!!</p>

 &#8220;Where are all these Somalis coming from?  Everywhere, from Finland to New Zealand, the world is being flooded with them!   That lawless, barren, desert country must be a non-stop baby factory. I think it must have one of the highest   &mdash;   or the highest   &mdash;   birth rates on earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Not quite at the very top of  the list, but close.  I did some checking and find that Somalia is eighth from the top. More interestingly  (but not surprising), I find that ALL of the top 47 &#8220;reproducers&#8221; are in Africa (with the exception of Afghanistan,  Yemen, Oman, Gaza, Laos, and Haiti).  Very revealing!</p>
<p>In fact, Haiti is pretty good by comparison; it&rsquo;s only  #38.<br>
No European (or white) country is anywhere near  the top hundred   &mdash;   nor is Mexico, which is #103. The entire top hundred list is dominated by the Third World, especially <i><b>the black world.  </b></i>  Eventually, even Mexico will be confronted by this reality (of black fertility and poverty). An endlessly multiplying supply of backward, superstitious, poverty-ridden African blacks flooding the world will demand to be  fed, taken in, cared for. I wonder how countries such as Mexico will handle it. </p>
<p>Also,  how many times in recent years have we read about recurring famines and starvation in Ethiopia or the Sahel?  Yet,   poverty, famine, and starvation do not deter these countries from reproducing at a frenetic rate.  In other words, we&rsquo;re feeding them just so they can reproduce like insects and have another famine in another generation, when we&rsquo;ll be asked to feed them again.  Does this kind of charity make sense? It would be more charitable to give them birth control.</p>

		<p>To Robert:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;It&rsquo;s an overt government operation to hault our national pride and love of country by giving foreign enemies the opportunity to create a cleft society and tote automatic rifles against us&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes.  Some on this board call our ruling elites &#8216;insane&rsquo; or &#8216;clueless.&rsquo;  They are neither:  They understand exactly what they are doing and are carrying out a carefully crafted 70-year plan to destroy Western Civilization and the Whites that created it.</p>
<p>I occasionally post on another site that is much more hard-core than this one and where the vast majority of the posts and writing would not get past the AmRen censors even though some of the writers and posters are downright brilliant.</p>
<p>What one poster brought up that I&rsquo;d never thought about is this:  The subversive elites who are bent on displacing Whites are making sure that we Whites have Nowhere to retreat to, nowhere to hide.  The British could always return to their home base of England, White American Citizens to the safety of a White-created/dominated United States, even South Africans fighting in WW II were able to retreat to the safety of SA.</p>
<p>No Longer.</p>
<p>What happens when our retreats are no longer our retreats?  When there is nowhere for Whites to retreat to?  Nowhere safe for Whites, for our elderly, our precious children?  Every corner of the US contains significant populations of hostile non-Whites?</p>
<p>This has happened in SA and is happening in the UK. In the US, it is being executed by moving fecund non-Whites into White enclaves and small and middle-sized White mid-western cities through placement of Section 8 housing and african refugees.</p>
<p>As poster #34 writes, the average somali has many children (statistically five, but 10-12 is not uncommon).  And these people aren&rsquo;t going anywhere.  Backwards, parasitic somalis, mexicans, bhutanese  are tools of the elites used to not only displace Whites but to destroy us financially and usurp our land.</p>
<p>This pogrom (because that&rsquo;s what it is)  is being carried out to demolish any remaining White cities and towns, terrify Whites, displace Whites in our own homelands, and, importantly, to destroy any and all White-dominated areas to prevent bastions of White power and destroy White retreats.</p>
<p>It is evil and diabolical and it is working.</p>
<p>And to Shawn #35:  Thank you for your kind words.  The more I study and learn about White displacement, the more it scares me.  I have several cyber-pals in South Africa and I see many parallels between our countries and how the end stage  here may play out:  With not only our displacement but a genocide against us.</p>
<p>It also infuriates me that I am unable to connect in person with any others on this board or attend White Nationalist-type meetings or conferences because I risk my livelihood if I do and there are a number of people who depend on me.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p>&#8220;Whites living in societies run by non-Whites are in physical danger.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;The biggest threat to white America is not stagnant population growth but lack of territory.&#8221; Istvan</p>
<p>  One of the laws of nature is territoriality; most animals (even small birds) will fight to the death to defend their territory, and yet whites (I guess we&rsquo;re not simple animals) are supposed to gladly hand over their birthright to terrorist-inclined Somali refugees. Another law of nature is protecting and providing for one&rsquo;s offspring.  Even the wren, the most diminutive of birds, will fight a hawk or owl for its chicks. Whose future is &#8220;our&#8221; government providing for by the mass importation of questionable Somalis? Why are they being deliberately settled in formerly all white rural areas?  Is this in the best interest of American taxpayers and citizens? </p>

<p>Patriot,<br>
I&rsquo;m right with you on this. It&rsquo;s easy to blame the State Department. This is just part of the agenda to disrupt the society totally, to have so much chaos that we&rsquo;ll lose our control of the situation.  The next step is the Declaration of Martial Law and the suspension of elections. </p>
<p>One point- &#8220;cajones&#8221; means drawers, cases or large boxes.<br>
The word for &#8220;balls&#8221; is &#8220;cojones&#8221;.<br>
I saw a cigar ad. in a magazine advertising &#8220;Carajos&#8221; which is an obscenity in Spanish. The correct word is &#8220;Corojos&#8221;. Amazing what a difference a vowel makes.</p>

C. Yablonski</p>
<p>***************</p>
<p>Very revealing.  These photos show Somalis &#8220;doing  their thing&#8221;.</p>
<p>I see that some apologists on that site are arguing that these photos are &#8220;raciss&#8221; and  &#8220;prejudice&#8221; because they were not taken in Maine.</p>
<p>So what?   That&rsquo;s irrelevant.   They are not intended to show us Maine.  They are intended to  show Somalis as they really are   &mdash;   a  lawless, primitive, cruel people, given to terrible violence and indifferent to any western ideas of mercy, decency or human rights. They are even cruel to their own kind (even to their own children), so what can WE expect  from them when we&rsquo;re on the receiving end?</p>
<p>This is what we are importing into peaceful, white communities! Communities which will not remain peaceful or white any longer. This, all in the mistaken name of Christian charity and under the delusion that &#8220;we are a nation of immigrants&#8221; and &#8220;all cultures are equal&#8221;, so we must open up the gates and accept the world.</p>

<p>OMG I thought no one would ever say anything about this! The Iftin Charter School is located at a place I used to work at. They rented space from us but we realized what a big mistake we had made when school started.

<p>That does not mean anything. Domain registrars ask for the same info, choose any name you like, choose an address that matches the phone prefix and provide a phone number that you will answer (throw away cell phones are an option). When they call and ask for that name confirm it is you. End of story. Now of course taking on NEW handles becomes a pain because you would have to provide another number for each new handle.</p>

I believe it has been stated several times that the Lutheran church is involved with bringing in africans by the thousands and there are probably other &#8216;christian&rsquo; groups involved&hellip;..the state dept could be in on it also.

		<p>Poster #44 gave a link, and a poster at that link gave such a poignant description that it just has to be posted here:</p>
<p>Whites in Maine will learn that they&rsquo;ll ruin their own cities if they allow non-whites to do what they want. </p>
<p>When I was growing up we lived in a city neighborhood surrounded by Black neighborhoods. Our neighborhood was beautiful. Just a few blocks down on either side were increasingly run down Black neighborhoods. </p>
<p>We as white kids formed close friendship with each other, something you don&rsquo;t see much of today. The great thing about my neighborhood was that it was almost a stereotypical North East Italian and Irish neighborhood. Every home had Irish or Italian flags, we had our little Italian sandwich shop and an Irish community center right across the street. There was the Roman Catholic school with the local parishioners on Sunday and kids neatly dressed in school uniforms. There were the elderly sitting on their front porch and kids playing or running through the streets playing tag. One of our favorite games was to try and catch a ball bounced off the wall. Occasionally, everyone would come outside and we could all tell who belonged on our streets and who didn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;d see a stranger walking through and you&rsquo;d steer at him.</p>
<p>The neighborhood changed, but put more accurately was cleansed. Whites including us felt unsafe and increasingly we felt limited to a smaller portion of the neighborhood as more whites fled and non-whites spread. I remember how a white kid who rode my bus could no longer walk through his own neighborhood which at that time had become black, he was left with little options than to routinely be harassed or beaten while he tried to reach his bus stop which was in my neighborhood. </p>
<p>You could feel the shift and atmosphere when my neighborhood started taking in non-whites. Car windows would be smashed, the local corner store was being robbed monthly, police and dogs could be heard patrolling. </p>
<p>Whites became victims. </p>
<p>One brutal attack against two young white boys has always angered me, a large group of roaming black men in their 20s bloody beat and robbed these kids of Halloween candy. Even though I was their age I felt so pissed that I had to see two kids crying with blood dripping from their face simply because they were white. I myself couldn&rsquo;t even freely walk outside anymore without occasionally being scared of being robbed because of one instance when I was robbed at gun point by a gang of blacks.</p>
<p>People say things don&rsquo;t change when race changes. That is the furthest from the truth. When one race replaces another the entire culture and atmosphere changes. </p>
<p>The neighborhood I partly grew up in with its brick row houses, clean lawns, and tiny alleyways has slowly become browner and blacker. I&rsquo;ve noticed those same changes happening to America. The U.S has slowly drifted away from classical American music to rap, from white clothing to browner clothing.</p>
<p>Changes happen, and America is heading down that road. You just don&rsquo;t even notice it until it&rsquo;s to late and your looking back at how things changed for the worst.<br>
