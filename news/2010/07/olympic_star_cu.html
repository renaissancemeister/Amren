			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Mays, AOL Black Voices, June 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Before he became a world-class swimmer and the second African American to win an Olympic gold medal in the sport, Cullen Jones almost died in the water.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But now, Jones is on a mission to prevent other African Americans and minorities from experiencing what he went through as a child through his involvement in Make a Splash, the national child-focused anti-drowning initiative from The USA Swimming Foundation.</p>
<p>Many African-American parents fear allowing their kids in the water to learn how to swim, which is creating potentially deadly situations.</p>
<p>A study, commissioned by USA Swimming and conducted by the University of Memphis, found that nearly 70 percent of African-American children and 58 percent of Hispanic children have low or no swim ability. Only 40 percent of Caucasians are in the same predicament. Black kids are three times more likely to drown than white children.</p>
<p>The study also found that parental fear is the biggest factor in preventing African Americans and Latinos from learning how to swim.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my own family, a lot of people are afraid of the water or don&rsquo;t know how to swim,&#8221; Jones said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fear even trumps finances as the main reason minority kids don&rsquo;t learn how to swim.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a stunning find,&#8221; Sue Anderson, director of Programs and Services in the Club Development Division of USA Swimming, told Aol Black Voices in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;Intuitively, the lack of access to pools or finances have been considered major factors. What we are finding now is some real deep fear on the part of parents. In most cases, the parents don&rsquo;t know how to swim and the kids don&rsquo;t know how to swim as well. It&rsquo;s being passed down,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>One parent from Denver told the survey-takers that she didn&rsquo;t want to pay for swimming lessons for her child, because she was fearful of him getting in the water.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anderson said she has been at competitive swimming events where black or Latino kids are participants and parents don&rsquo;t even want to go near the water to serve as volunteer timekeepers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even more alarming is that there seems to be an epidemic of false confidence among African-American and Latino children. Of the 40 percent of children who said they knew how to swim in the survey, only 18 percent had taken swim lessons from a professional. Anderson says about 28 percent of Latino kids surveyed and 26 percent of African Americans say they taught themselves how to swim.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>African Americans&rsquo; fear of water could be based on historical factors, such as segregated pools that sought to keep blacks out. Last year, 60 black and Latino campers were kicked out from a private Philadelphia swim club they contracted to use for the summer, because there was concern they would alter the &#8220;complexion&#8221; and &#8220;atmosphere&#8221; of the club. Jones said he was &#8220;appalled&#8221; by the incident.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other factors, such as the myth that chlorine damages brown skin, men thinking they have to wear revealing bikini briefs and women and girls not wanting to mess up their hair by getting in the water, also create a reluctance to learn to swim.</p>
<p>When confronted with the chlorine myth, Jones said that he always talks about the benefit of lotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&rsquo;re ashy, that&rsquo;s what they have lotion for. I&rsquo;ve been swimming for 17 years and I&rsquo;m not ashy all the time,&#8221; Jones said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anderson said the goal is to make swimming 35 to 40 percent minority. &#8220;Those gold medalists are out there,&#8221; said Anderson.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need more colors. We can&rsquo;t just have one color. When you see Cullen talking to a crowd of kids, their eyes are like saucers. That message is very powerful,&#8221; she added.</p>

		<p>Once again, segregation and racism are explained as the reason for black failure.  It&rsquo;s really getting tiresome.  Moreover, the black &#8220;campers&#8221; were kicked out of the Philadelphia pool for the usual unruly acting out, particularly around whites and in white environments.  Their usual obnoxious behavior escalates.  I don&rsquo;t really know if that is because they are trying to draw attention to themselves, or if it&rsquo;s because they just naturally trash whatever environment they are in.  I do know blacks hate rules, any rules, and don&rsquo;t seem capable of behaving in a civilized fashion whether it&rsquo;s in a movie theatre, a grocery store, a Walmart, a swimming pool, a day care, a church sunday school program, and any place else.  THAT is what gets them kicked out.  Their fear of the water probably comes from ineptitude.  Swimming requires an entirely different set of coordination skills and confidence than football or basketball.</p>

		<p>Cullen Jones is an alright swimmer, but IMHO, many deserving whites were left off the 2008 team so that he and his non-chlorine damaged black skin could be on the team.  He has a gold medal, but only as part of the 4x100 relay team, on which he had the slowest split of the four Americans.  Aaron Piersol bailed him, not to mention Michael Phelps and the third member, out, big time.</p>

		<p>Really, there isn&rsquo;t anything wrong with this, since a lot of blacks and Mexicians are unable to swim. And blacks like Cullen Jones who are good in swimming tend to be sprinters like track.</p>

		<p>The author could have at least mentioned the differnces in body fat and bouyancy.  I certainly have the impression that Africans don&rsquo;t swim either, so it&rsquo;s not segregation.  And blacks seem to have a much greater fear of snakes than whites.  Maybe it&rsquo;s an ancestral memory of Africa</p>

<p>- - Where are the people saying that about Basketball, Football and Track???  Those sports are dominated by Blacks but to say that about Blacks would be racist.  The longer we tolerate this incredible double standard(&rsquo;s) the worse they&rsquo;re going to get.</p>

		<p>Africans certainly do have the capacity for swimming very well, as I can remember from my youth at the community college swimming pool. They are also much more muscular and actually sink if they don&rsquo;t move their arms and legs in the water.</p>
<p>Every person at my old lifeguard classes, both black and white, could see this for ourselves. Black men would slide under the surface in a moment; black women had much less of a problem staying afloat and performed in a manner comparable to whites. </p>
<p>Black men just need to kick a little and then they are fine in the water, so that competitive swimming is a sport where blacks could do very well.</p>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s why blacks and hispanics can&rsquo;t swim; discrimination.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t heard the rumor about chlorine and brown skin. I think I need to get that message out. I don&rsquo;t want to see browns damaging their skin with chlorine.</p>

		<p>So &#8216;historical factors&rsquo; have prevented blacks from learning how to swim.  And of course, the &#8216;factors&rsquo; are discriminashun.</p>
<p>How about getting out of the hood and going to the beach and practicing?  Laziness or lack of ambition cannot be solved by money and government programs.</p>
<p>Then what about latinos?  Whites have no &#8216;historical&rsquo; obligation to them.  If the majority can&rsquo;t swim, blame latino governments and make them pay money to rectify the situation.  No American white has anything to do with latinos not knowing how to swim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Other factors, such as the myth that chlorine damages brown skin, men thinking they have to wear revealing bikini briefs and women and girls not wanting to mess up their hair by getting in the water, also create a reluctance to learn to swim.&#8221;</p>
<p>So how are they gonna blame whitey for those factors?  If LAtrina doesn&rsquo;t want her hair messed up or Dequan is ashamed of wearing revealing swimsuits, how can whitey be blamed?</p>

		<p> Our elite have decreed that blacks are better at sports than all other races, and they will tolerate no heretics! Anyone who disagrees is a racist, and all facts at odds with this presumption of superiority are dumped down the old Orwellian memory hole. How do the elites deal with the fact that most boxing championships are now held by Whites from Eastern Europe?-Easy-they just stop covering boxing. Hbo has announced publicly that they won&rsquo;t cover boxing until there are more black champions, and ESPN covers boxing exclusively now by providing the public with retrospectives on that paragon of sportsmanship and manly virtue, Muhammud Ali-the Martin Luther King, Jr. of sports. Their boxing gurus, Bert Sugar and Teddy Atlas, are faced with the choice of kissing Ali&rsquo;s posterior endlessly, or collecting unemployment. The NBA was recently given an &#8220;A&#8221; by Richard Lapchick&rsquo;s(thats &#8220;Lapchick&#8221;, not &#8220;Lapdog&#8221;), Institute for Diversity in Sports for achieving 80% black players-thereby making it the least racially diverse professional sport in the  world. The Webster&rsquo;s Dictionary definition of diversity apparently no longer applies. In  today&rsquo;s Orwellian world, &#8220;Diversity&#8221; means &#8220;getting rid of white people&#8221;.</p>

<p>Only a liberal would see it as &#8220;intuitive&#8221; that a lack of money would be the cause of a relative paucity of black swimmers.  I learned how to swim when my parents drove the kids to the local lake.  It didn&rsquo;t cost much, which was good because my parents didn&rsquo;t have a lot to spend.</p>

<p>This is a curious statement.  It implies that you can&rsquo;t <i>really</i> know how to swim unless you are taught by a professional.  Maybe it&rsquo;s not false confidence   &mdash;   maybe those kids really do know how to swim, despite their lack of lessons from professionals.</p>
<p>I often do 30 - 40 mile bike rides, but I obviously have false confidence in my ability to cycle.  After all, I was never taught from a professional.<br>

<p>Go read &#8220;Contested Waters: A Social History Of Swimming Pools In America&#8221; by Jeff Wiltse. Yes, public pools were segregated up until the late &#8216;50&rsquo;s, but Jeff Mays conveniently leaves out the fact that Blacks had their OWN beautiful public pools in their OWN neighborhoods. It&rsquo;s only when they weren&rsquo;t satisfied with swimming in their OWN neighborhood pools, and insisted on invading Whitey&rsquo;s pools, that the segregation was enforced by violence. White men at that time were very territorial and would zealously guard their turf from all comers. When the justice system favored Blacks&rsquo; interests against Whites&rsquo;, White people saw the handwriting on the wall and gave up, moved out of the city and built their own pools in their backyards. The end of municipal life for Whites, and the beginning of isolation in suburbia. Within four years, all the (formerly) White public pools that were taken over by blacks were closed due to loss of revenue. As we see time and time again, only White people can build and maintain Western Civilization.  </p>

<p>Right. It had always been thought to be a &#8220;resources&#8221; issue. NOW it is realized it is a much difficult problem. </p>

		<p>&#8220;I certainly have the impression that Africans don&rsquo;t swim, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Europe had the nasty wildlife living in its rivers and lakes that Africa has, swimming wouldn&rsquo;t have become much of a passtime for us, either.  In addition to crocodiles, which kill more humans in Africa than any other wildlife except malaria-spreading mosquitos, rivers in sub-saharan Africa are frequented by bull sharks.  The range of the bull shark, the species responsible for most of the world&rsquo;s shark attacks on humans, does not (according to the map in Wikipedia) extend into European waters - not even the Meditteranean.  Hippos are also extremely aggressive.</p>
<p>The subcutaneous fat that Europeans grow more readily than Africans notonly makes us more bouyant, but in addition does its intended dry land job, acting as an insulator.  White people thus would not normally suffer from hypothermia as quickly, assuming equal water temperatures.</p>

		<p>GoAway at 1:39 A.M. -  Within four years, all the (formerly) White public pools that were taken over by blacks were closed due to loss of revenue. </p>
<p> Because it was NEVER about them wanting to swim to begin with. It was a WHITE pool and it had to be destroyed. Once they&rsquo;ve accomplished their mission, the leave and go to the next target - a White mall, school, country club, social gathering etc.. Blacks like nothing more than to go busting in on Whites where they&rsquo;re clearly not wanted. At the very least, they have a chance at the ghetto lottery. I once had a black thug co-worker that told me that on his days off he liked driving through rich White neighborhoods blasting rap music just to &#8220;piss off White folks&#8221;.  </p>

<p>They can&rsquo;t even behave at a wedding.  Considering the rarity of such an event in the Afro co-MOONity one would think that  it would be a motivation to make it memorable one. Well actually a shooting at a wedding would certainly be memorable to any group but Blacks since shooting is so routine. Know whaaam sain?</p>
