<h1>Belly-Buttons Key to Success in Sport: Study</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Karin Zeitvogel, AFP, July 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Scientists have found the reason why blacks dominate on the running track and whites in the swimming pool: it&rsquo;s in their belly-buttons, a study published Monday shows.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s important is not whether an athlete has an innie or an outie but where his or her navel is in relation to the rest of the body, says the study published in the International Journal of Design and Nature and Ecodynamics.</p>
<p>The navel is the center of gravity of the body, and given two runners or swimmers of the same height, one black and one white, &#8220;what matters is not total height but the position of the belly-button, or center of gravity,&#8221; Duke University professor Andre Bejan, the lead author of the study, told AFP.</p>
<p>&#8220;It so happens that in the architecture of the human body of West African-origin runners, the center of gravity is significantly higher than in runners of European origin,&#8221; which puts them at an advantage in sprints on the track, he said.</p>
<p>Individuals of West African-origin have longer legs than European-origin athletes, which means their belly-buttons are three centimeters (1.18 inches) higher than whites&rsquo;, said Bejan.</p>
<p>That means the black athletes have a &#8220;hidden height&#8221; that is three percent greater than whites&rsquo;, which gives them a significant speed advantage on the track.</p>
<p>&#8220;Locomotion is essentially a continual process of falling forward, and mass that falls from a higher altitude, falls faster,&#8221; Bejan explained.</p>
<p>In the pool, meanwhile, whites have the advantage because they have longer torsos, making their belly-buttons lower in the general scheme of body architecture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swimming is the art of surfing the wave created by the swimmer,&#8221; said Bejan.</p>
<p>&#8220;The swimmer who makes the bigger wave is the faster swimmer, and a longer torso makes a bigger wave. Europeans have a three-percent longer torso than West Africans, which gives them a 1.5-percent speed advantage in the pool,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Asians have the same long torsos as Europeans, giving them the same potential to be record-breakers in the pool.</p>
<p>But they often lose out to whites because whites are taller, said Bejan.</p>
<p>Many scientists have avoided studying why blacks make better sprinters and whites better swimmers because of what the study calls the &#8220;obvious&#8221; race angle.</p>
<p>But Bejan said the study he conducted with Edward Jones, a professor at Howard University in Washington, and Duke graduate Jordan Charles, focused on the athletes&rsquo; geographic origins and biology, not race, which the authors of the study call a &#8220;social construct.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bejan is white, originally from Romania, and Jones is black, from South Carolina.</p>
<p>They charted and analyzed nearly 100 years of records in men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s sprinting and 100-meters freestyle swimming for the study.<br>

		<p>This news item is completetly irrelevant to the fundamental crisis facing the Native Born White Majority which is race-replacement at the hands of high fertility post-1965  nonwhites. This is kind of frivolous stuff that seems to fascinate Steve Sailer to the complete exclusion of any serious discussion of the race-replacement issue on his web site and in particular the very nasty consequences of Asian legal immigration. A very good way to sidtrack a discussion of the race replacement issue is to post news stories about the genetic basis of sprinting. </p>

		<p>If in our time, J. Phillipe Rushton, or many decades ago, GNSWP-approved scientists would have done the same research with such an insignificant part of the human anatomy, drawing such vacuous conclusions, the libs would ridicule them to no end.</p>
<p>What this all means is that when I&rsquo;m in the shower tomorrow morning, (or the gym shower tonight, if I can get the time), I can look down and see the source of all my athletic ills.</p>

		<p>That is great.<br>
What Amren stands for is now getting more and more mainstream (because it can&rsquo;t be denied anymore). And watch at the comment, nobody believes race to be a social construct.</p>
<p>BTW, please Mr. Taylor and Webster put more Videos on youtube. I have found you their and if you watch the comments under the videos of the Amren conferences or the interviews on TV, you will see how many people who would not call themselves racist totally agree with you and listen to you and thinking about it without any ideologies. <br>
You have now the chance to make young people think before they got brainwashed.</p>

		<p>East Asians have shorter arms than Europeans.  I don&rsquo;t believe East Asians have the same length torsos as Europeans.  I think East Asians have slightly longer torsos.</p>

		<p>OJ [Simpson] said that blacks can run faster than whitey because blacks have narrow ankles but thick calves. They cannot wear knee high socks because they stretch the elastic and the socks fall down. And if OJ said it was so, it must be so!!</p>

<p>More nonsense.  English have very short legs and long torso&rsquo;s compared to mainland europeans and especially northern europeans.  There is no race as varied in appearance as &#8220;typical whites&#8221; despite what the post WWII anti-white propaganda machine would like you to believe. </p>

		<p>In swimming,  it&rsquo;s  the  length  of  legs  and  arms  that  power  the  body  forward. So expect  blacks  to  dominate  in swimming  if they  decide to  take  it seriously.  </p>

I see your point.  On the other hand, it could also be a very good way to get such a discussion started.<br>
