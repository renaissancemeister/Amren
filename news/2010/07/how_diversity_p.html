<h1>How Diversity Punishes Asians, Poor Whites and Lots of Others</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Russell K. Nieli, Minding the Campus, July 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When college presidents and academic administrators pay their usual obeisance to &#8220;diversity&#8221; you know they are talking first and foremost about race. More specifically, they are talking about blacks. {snip}</p>
<p>As a secondary meaning &#8220;diversity&#8221; can also encompass Hispanics, who together with blacks are often subsumed by college administrators and admissions officers under the single race category &#8220;underrepresented minorities.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>Asians, unlike blacks and Hispanics, receive no boost in admissions. Indeed, the opposite is often the case, as the quota-like mentality that leads college administrators to conclude they may have &#8220;too many&#8221; Asians. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While almost all college administrators and college admissions officers at the most elite institutions think in racial balancing and racial quota-like terms when they assemble their student body, they almost always deny this publically in a blizzard of rhetoric about a more far-flung &#8220;diversity.&#8221; Indeed, there is probably no other area where college administrators are more likely to lie or conceal the truth of what they are doing than in the area of admissions and race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The Diversity Colleges Want</b></p>
<p>A new study by Princeton sociologist Thomas Espenshade and his colleague Alexandria Radford is a real eye-opener in revealing just what sorts of students highly competitive colleges want  &mdash;  or don&rsquo;t want  &mdash;  on their campuses and how they structure their admissions policies to get the kind of &#8220;diversity&#8221; they seek. The Espenshade/Radford study draws from a new data set, the National Study of College Experience (NSCE), which was gathered from eight highly competitive public and private colleges and universities (entering freshmen SAT scores: 1360). {snip}</p>
<p>Consistent with other studies, though in much greater detail, Espenshade and Radford show the substantial admissions boost, particularly at the private colleges in their study, which Hispanic students get over whites, and the enormous advantage over whites given to blacks. They also show how Asians must do substantially better than whites in order to reap the same probabilities of acceptance to these same highly competitive private colleges. On an &#8220;other things equal basis,&#8221; where adjustments are made for a variety of background factors, being Hispanic conferred an admissions boost over being white (for those who applied in 1997) equivalent to 130 SAT points (out of 1600), while being black rather than white conferred a 310 SAT point advantage. Asians, however, suffered an admissions penalty compared to whites equivalent to 140 SAT points.</p>
<p>The box students checked off on the racial question on their application was thus shown to have an extraordinary effect on a student&rsquo;s chances of gaining admission to the highly competitive private schools in the NSCE database. To have the same chances of gaining admission as a black student with an SAT score of 1100, an Hispanic student otherwise equally matched in background characteristics would have to have a 1230, a white student a 1410, and an Asian student a 1550. Here the Espenshade/Radford results are consistent with other studies, including those of William Bowen and Derek Bok in their book The Shape of the River, though they go beyond this influential study in showing both the substantial Hispanic admissions advantage and the huge admissions penalty suffered by Asian applicants. Although all highly competitive colleges and universities will deny that they have racial quotas  &mdash;  either minimum quotas or ceiling quotas  &mdash;  the huge boosts they give to the lower-achieving black and Hispanic applicants, and the admissions penalties they extract from their higher-achieving Asian applicants, clearly suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>Espenshade and Radford also take up very thoroughly the question of &#8220;class based preferences&#8221; and what they find clearly shows a general disregard for improving the admission chances of poor and otherwise disadvantaged whites. Other studies, including a 2005 analysis of nineteen highly selective public and private universities by William Bowen, Martin Kurzweil, and Eugene Tobin, in their 2003 book, Equity and Excellence in American Higher Education, found very little if any advantage in the admissions process accorded to whites from economically or educationally disadvantaged families compared to whites from wealthier or better educated homes. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When lower-class whites are matched with lower-class blacks and other non-whites the degree of the non-white advantage becomes astronomical: lower-class Asian applicants are seven times as likely to be accepted to the competitive private institutions as similarly qualified whites, lower-class Hispanic applicants eight times as likely, and lower-class blacks ten times as likely. These are enormous differences and reflect the fact that lower-class whites were rarely accepted to the private institutions Espenshade and Radford surveyed. Their diversity-enhancement value was obviously rated very low.</p>
<p><b>Poor Non-White Students: &#8220;Counting Twice&#8221;</b></p>
<p>{snip} Private institutions, Espenshade and Radford suggest, &#8220;intentionally save their scarce financial aid dollars for students who will help them look good on their numbers of minority students.&#8221; Quoting a study by NYU researcher Mitchell Stevens, they write: &#8220;ultimate evaluative preference for members of disadvantaged groups was reserved for applicants who could be counted in the college&rsquo;s multicultural statistics. This caused some admissions officers no small amount of ethical dismay.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} The ugly truth is that most colleges, especially the more competitive private ones, are fiercely concerned with their ratings by rating organizations like U.S. News &amp; World Report. And an important part of those ratings consist of a numerical acceptance rate (the ratio of applicants received to those accepted) and a yield score (the ratio of those accepted to those who enroll). The lower the acceptance rate and the higher the yield score the more favorably colleges are looked upon. In extending admissions to well-qualified but financially strapped whites who are unlikely to enroll, a college would be driving both its acceptance rate and its yield score in the wrong direction. Academic bureaucrats rarely act against either their own or their organization&rsquo;s best interests (as they perceive them), and while their treatment of lower-class whites may for some be a source of &#8220;no small amount of ethical dismay,&#8221; that&rsquo;s just how it goes. Some of the private colleges Espenshade and Radford describe would do well to come clean with their act and admit the truth: &#8220;Poor Whites Need Not Apply!&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides the bias against lower-class whites, the private colleges in the Espenshade/Radford study seem to display what might be called an urban/Blue State bias against rural and Red State occupations and values. This is most clearly shown in a little remarked statistic in the study&rsquo;s treatment of the admissions advantage of participation in various high school extra-curricular activities. In the competitive private schools surveyed participation in many types of extra-curricular activities  &mdash;  including community service activities, performing arts activities, and &#8220;cultural diversity&#8221; activities  &mdash;  conferred a substantial improvement in an applicant&rsquo;s chances of admission. {snip}</p>
<p>But what Espenshade and Radford found in regard to what they call &#8220;career-oriented activities&#8221; was truly shocking even to this hardened veteran of the campus ideological and cultural wars. Participation in such Red State activities as high school ROTC, 4-H clubs, or the Future Farmers of America was found to reduce very substantially a student&rsquo;s chances of gaining admission to the competitive private colleges in the NSCE database on an all-other-things-considered basis. The admissions disadvantage was greatest for those in leadership positions in these activities or those winning honors and awards. {snip} Excelling in these activities &#8220;is associated with 60 or 65 percent lower odds of admission.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} In his Bakke ruling Lewis Powell was impressed by the argument Harvard College offered defending the educational value of a demographically diverse student body: &#8220;A farm boy from Idaho can bring something to Harvard College that a Bostonian cannot offer. Similarly, a black student can usually bring something that a white person cannot offer.&#8221; The Espenshade/Radford study suggests that those farm boys from Idaho would do well to stay out of their local 4-H clubs or FFA organizations  &mdash;  or if they do join, they had better not list their membership on their college application forms. This is especially true if they were officers in any of these organizations. Future farmers of America don&rsquo;t seem to count in the diversity-enhancement game played out at some of our more competitive private colleges, and are not only not recruited, but seem to be actually shunned. It is hard to explain this development other than as a case of ideological and cultural bias.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many universities, including Princeton, are interested in enrolling foreign students, along with students from disparate regions of the U.S. But the more competitive private universities seem to have little interest in diversifying their student bodies when it comes to people who have served in the American military or people who intend to make a career out of military service. Even if they don&rsquo;t shun such people, or hold their military service or aspirations against them, they clearly don&rsquo;t seek them out or court them the way they do &#8220;underrepresented&#8221; racial minorities. And while many universities host college-level ROTC programs (often for financial reasons), the military/civilian relationship on campus is usually far from amicable.</p>
<p>{snip} If nothing else the new Espenshade/Radford study helps to document what knowledgeable observers have long known: &#8220;diversity&#8221; at competitive colleges today involves a politically engineered stew of different groups. drawn from the ingredients selected by reigning campus ideology. Since that ideology is mainly dictated by the Left, it is no surprise that the diversity achieved is what the larger American landscape looks like when it is viewed through a leftist lens. {snip}</p>

		<p>This article has great merit. Indeed, the example of Asian students is perhaps the best of all. Look at the state universities in California where Asians (namely Chinese and Japanese) have been somewhat curtailed in matriculation in recent years because of the &#8220;need&#8221; to save some slots for hispanic and black students whom had far lower test scores or entry credentials as the over achieving Asian students. The same dynamic works against White kids as well.</p>

		<p>Apparently, it seems that the older the university, the more prestigious. Older high schools in America, on the other hand, appear to be antiquated creaking buildings who have already seen their better days.</p>
<p>As better qualified whites and asians are turned down by the Ivy League, they will simply turn up in lesser known colleges. In the future, expect the more successful people to be graduates from these smaller schools.</p>
<p>As for Yale and Harvard, it&rsquo;s not very difficult to imagine spray painted walls, broken windows, and TSU/Morris Brown type scandals in the not too distant future. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not as impressed with an Ivy League graduate as I once was. I know I can outscore a black graduate from one of these so-called top universities. I know because I have done so many times. </p>

		<p>Many whites could deal with Affirmative Action, perhaps, if it was acknowledge whites are giving up something for &#8216;the common good&rsquo;, but that&rsquo;s not how it works. The more aggressive the affirmative action program, the more the administrators go on about how it is Whites who are the beneficiaries of privilege, and it is whites and white society that is discriminating, against people of color. Not to mention all the unfair oppression of, non-whites. Why do we know what they say is true? Because they say so, and so do the racial interest groups (for people of color) they exalt. I&rsquo;m starting to think it&rsquo;s not really about separating whites from their jobs at all but about separating white boys from their girlfriends, and hoping no one notices through the &#8216;victim&rsquo; smokescreen. </p>
<p>Regardless, AA&rsquo;s days are numbered. The day white men are denied the benefits of any kind of &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; too&hellip; thats the day non-whites discriminating against whites, by means of AA, will be doomed to a short lifecycle too. </p>

		<p>Diversity not only damages poor Whites, it especially damages middle-class Whites and can be the cause of Whites demotion to poverty.  This is what the power-brokers want.  Also, why are Asians put first above?  Did they settle this country?  Did they build this country?  Did they send a man to the moon?  Did they establish Western culture?  Did they do anything besides emigrate here and taken advantage of Whites&rsquo; collective weaknesses?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Whites belong first above and we should be the most important group.</p>

		<p>Nieli: &#8220;To have the same chances of gaining admission as a black student with an SAT score of 1100, an Hispanic student otherwise equally matched in background characteristics would have to have a 1230, a white student a 1410, and an Asian student a 1550.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to a 2004 Washington Post report, this creates a &#8220;frenzied&#8221; scramble among Ivy League schools for the few blacks scoring over 1300:</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the College Board, 1,877 African American students nationwide scored higher than 1300 out of a possible 1600 on the SAT last year, compared with nearly 150,000 students overall who achieved that score. Minority students with higher SAT scores have become the target of frenzied competition between state and private colleges.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ted Spencer, chief admissions officer at the University of Michigan: &#8216;We are all shooting for the same small group of students.&rsquo;&#8221;*</p>

		<p>I am a White Nationalist. I don&rsquo;t care how it harms Asians. I only care how harms it  members of the Native Born White population. Asians in America are active participants in the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans. They can vote for it every time they vote. </p>
<p>Asians will start flooding into the state schools which were built by and paid for by the Native Born White majority. It will be rat race competition to get into the state schools. Of course if the Chinese Exclusion Act had never been repealed, this problem wouldn&rsquo;t exist today.</p>

<p>Me neither, after seeing how Ivy League graduates have handled things in Washington and on Wall Street in the last 3 years. In other words, an Ivy League sheepskin is no proof that its holder has wisdom and common sense, which, unlike intelligence, is not innate; and, unlike knowledge, is not something that can be taught in schools.</p>

		<p>I started reading the article, but then just started to skim it since I&rsquo;ve seen these examples over and over again. </p>
<p>Yes, blacks and Hispanics have the whammy over us due to their being united to get what&rsquo;s theirs (and ours). </p>
<p>Whites will not work as a group or organize politically. Moreover, most stay with the groupthink that we are the bad guys - like 40 or 50 years out of date. </p>

		<p> This is the kind of article that should be published in every newspaper and on every website in this land   &mdash;   but it won&rsquo;t be, partly because it&rsquo;s long and requires a certain amount of literacy to understand, but mostly because it points up some inconvenient truths that the college administrators and the mainstream media would like to keep hidden from us.</p>
<p> Anyone who wonders about the forward march of illiteracy and school chaos in this country should ponder this column. In the classroom, we must have &#8220;diversity&#8221;   &mdash;   which, as the author notes, means &#8220;more blacks on campus.&#8221; Real diversity, of skills, background, religious heritage, regional origin, is ignored in the interests of keeping the federal race counters and the black militant grievance industry happy.</p>
<p> But, interestingly enough, on the basketball court or football field, skill is supposedly the only thing that counts   &mdash;   and coaches have convinced themselves that nearly all the &#8220;good&#8221; players are black. Tell that to the World Cup champion (all-White) Spanish team. </p>

		<p>I agree with Awakened and Jupiter. I couldn&rsquo;t care less about the Asians&rsquo; &#8220;disadvantages&#8221; in elite admissions. They take places from whites, as they benefit from institutions they did not create. There are already too many Asians in America, and they keep coming!</p>

		<p>Just like in Great Britain poor white people are being left behind.  The dream of working your way up in society is being cut off for poor white people in order to advantage non-white people to &#8220;correct&#8221; white people&rsquo;s monumental contributions to society.</p>
<p>East Asians make it into colleges by force.  They study for hours for the SATs so when they actually take the test they are well prepared for it.  There are seven East Asians and 42 Caucasians in the top 50 money earners on the World Poker Tour.  The average number of tournaments played by the East Asians are 66 and for Caucasians it&rsquo;s 44.  In FIDE chess 47 of the top 50 players are Caucasian and three are East Asian.  While the top Caucasian players participated on average in 13 games the East Asian players participated in 25.  East Asians do very well on static or repetitious tasks like tests where the parameters are already known by preparing more than other groups.  On tasks that are dynamic and involve a human like chess they overwhelm the system by playing more matches than other groups.</p>

		<p>I graduated from college in 1976. At the time, I noticed that college professors hated poor white people like me. I presumed that they were snobs. They liked blacks and hispanics. I never understood why.<br>
   Poor whites tend to show up for class, do the classwork, ect. Minorities, from my experience tend to drop out after a few classes.<br>
   This is my grip with the rating system. They measure who enrolls. They never mention who graduates. I remember only a few non-whites at my graduation ceremony. </p>

 Ridiculous the truth is no defense in propping up racial set-asides. Obviously we white folk are super privlidged just by being white! That&rsquo;s the argument they&rsquo;ll use and most fools will buy it.</p>

		<p>Whites will continue to be shut out until they unify and stop voting for Democrats. No other racial group has to put up with the equivalent of the white liberal. They stress and practice racial unity. They have no Chris Matthews or Rosie ODonnel to contend with. In other races such wimps would be &#8216;race traitors&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>To test the true intent, objectives AND consequent reactions of the Marxist Liberal self-hate White elite AND that of their legions of enabled non-White beneficiaries, it would be advantageous for White academics to commence advocating mass miscegenation between various non-White groups such as Amerindians, Latinos, sub-continent Dravidian Indians and African-Americans including the latter&rsquo;s more recently arrived racial brethren, native Africans - all in the interests of <i>multiculturalism, tolerance and diversity</i>, naturally.<br>

		<p>As the the post-1965 asians student increases significantly on state university campuses, the Native Born White Male population on  state uiversity campuses across America will decline very rapidly. The few remaining Native Born White Males on state university campuses will feel like foreigners in a hostile country. This has already happened in the California State University System.</p>
<p>According to HBD enthusiast Richard Hoste in a recent Vdare.com column immigration reformers must recognize the very valuable contributions made by Asians in America in technology. Richard Hoste apparently believes that these advanes in technology would not have been made if the Asians had not been allowed into America. I don&rsquo;t believe a word of this. But more importantly, the geneline of  imported Asian technologist  are not only driving Native Born White American Males off American state university system, it is also actively participating in the persecution of the minority Native Born White Male student population at the UCSD.</p>
<p>I have 0 tolerance for the asianphilia of Steve Sailer and Richard Hoste.<br>

		<p>&hellip;And stop voting for Republicans, and so called Libertarians too. It was the &#8220;Reagan revolution&#8221; that legalized all of the Mexicans here the first time, with quite a bit of republican support in the house, and senate&hellip;</p>
<p><br>
I don&rsquo;t know about so called elite private schools, but I do know about state medical schools, and how affirmative action plays out there. Some of the people in my classes can&rsquo;t spell or pronounce even basic words. Many of them don&rsquo;t know the difference between things like &#8220;here&#8221;, and &#8220;hear&#8221;, &#8220;their&#8221;, &#8220;there&#8221;, and &#8220;they&rsquo;re&#8221;. I&rsquo;ve sat through some pretty pathetic power point presentations that have had some extremely comical errors. Some of these folks will be your doctors, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists in the future. </p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even bother with turning in an application to the so called elite pharmacy school here. I&rsquo;m in the top 10% of students where I&rsquo;m at, but I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t even get in the door there. Their admissions policy included 70% minority enrollment. For white men that means they are competing for between 20-30 slots, and with 4000+ applicants it was simply a waste of the admissions fee. </p>

<p>To be fair, I&rsquo;m sure that many White students also study hours on end for the SATs. It&rsquo;s not just Asians. I would hardly call that getting into college &#8220;by force&#8221;; dedication and genuine hard work should be given its due.</p>
<p>The explanation for what you&rsquo;ve observed about the WPT and FIDE could be due in part to the law of averages. Since there are significantly fewer Asian players, then their average stats will often be higher simply because you are dividing by a smaller number. Also, being a professional poker player is a risky venture for anyone. If Asians are slightly more risk-averse than Whites are, then it stands to reason that those Asians who do make it and compete successfully on the Tour are ultra motivated and/or committed relative to their peers - which may also contribute to a higher number of tournaments played. Simply put, I think mathematics and selection forces play a greater role here than race does. </p>

		<p>Remember the old example:</p>
<p>* Top rated universities in their effort to increase minorities accept students better suited for second tier schools.</p>
<p>* The second tier schools are then forced to chose from minorities better suited for 3rd tiered schools.</p>
<p>And so on.  </p>

		<p>If they are going to limit the number of Asians, why don&rsquo;t they increase the number of Black, Hispanics, and Whites? Why is it always about increasing the number of Blacks and Hispanics?</p>

		<p>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t care about Asians being discriminated or their plight. I only care about my family, my brothers and sisters, that is other whites. Is any other race concerned with the well being of whites? Are Asians protesting  whites being discriminated in college admission? . It&rsquo;s important for whites to understand that we must work together, organize, and unite. We need to organize politically, have some kind of solidarity movement. </p>

		<p>East Asians prepare way more for the SATs than any other group.  Going to SAT prep camps and buying SAT study guides is way more common for East Asians than it is other groups.  I was told by my (white) counselor that there was no point in studying for the SATs because the test was too long.  I studied anyway.  From what I heard none of the white students at my school attended SAT prep camps and mostly the smart students prepared with study guides, the rest didn&rsquo;t prepare at all.</p>

		<p>This would not be such a big deal except that minorities are unable to build Universities the way whites did.  At best, these minorities can participate in schools that whites built, in the case of Asians, they can even do better academically.  Nonetheless, they don&rsquo;t really expand the opportunities for all.  They only compete for scarce resources.   </p>

		<p>What is needed to end anti-white descrimination on the part of universities is a good ol&rsquo; fashion boycott. Literally. All whites who have any common sense should decide not to attend any colleges that are known under the guise of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; to discrimnate against whites starting this fall. They shouldn&rsquo;t enroll themselves or their kids in any colleges starting this September. If this were carried out on a large scale this would bring these universities to their knees finacially and they&rsquo;d be forced to change. And all institutions of higher learning that are taxpayer funded should have all their $$$$ with-held until  all anti-white admissions quotos are stoped. We should demand this action from our politicians. Boycott, boycott, boycott!!!! This is the way to deal with the smug and arrogant elitists running these places who seem to derive pleasure from giving  whites the shaft so they can feed their egos on how virtuous they are because of their sick fettish with &#8216;diversity&rsquo;.   </p>

		<p>I have a very smart white child with high SATs and AP scores. The Ivy League schools are sending their brochures  &mdash;  all cookie cutter  &mdash;  like the booklet from Yale that I looked over today. It is almost comical  &mdash;  the black dean who was a dancer, the cultural centers for blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, etc.  &mdash;  everyone except Euro-Americans. Then there were the friendship groups that all happen to have about two blacks, a Latino, an Asian, etc. and token white, some of whom (I am not kidding) are represented as talking about various strategies for being able to visit Cuba. As I told my savvy kid  &mdash;  this is so over the top, it&rsquo;s like a satire. How far will this naive Utopianism go before it turns murderous? </p>
