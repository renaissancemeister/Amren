			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jordan Fabian, The Hill, July 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Labor unions oppose the Arizona immigration law because some of them want to legalize then recruit illegals into their ranks, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Wednesday.</p>
<p>McCain specifically mentioned the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) as one union that wants to engage in the practice since it represents many people who work in the tourism industry, which he said employs many illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;They want to have them declared legal to recruit them into unions,&#8221; he said in an appearance on the conservative Michael Medved radio show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Labor unions have been some of the staunchest critics of the Arizona law [SB 1070], arguing that it would result in racial discrimination.</p>

		<p>How anyone in Arizona could vote for this horrible person is beyond me. Could the party label mean that much to Arizona voters? There are times you have to vote for the other party to remove and punish the incumbent. Connecticut had a similar dirtbag for Senator named Lowell Weicker years ago. The late William F Buckley Jr. started a PAC against Weicker. While we&rsquo;re stuck with Joe Lieberman in Connecticut, these &#8220;maverick&#8221; senators simply must be punished!!</p>

		<p>Let em get illegal aliens into the unions.  The more expensive they become to hire, the sooner the ruling class will close the border.</p>

<p>Really, John?  Gosh, I never would have guessed it!  It&rsquo;s so hard to believe, isn&rsquo;t it?  I suppose that&rsquo;s why you haven&rsquo;t been aware of any of these things until now.</p>
<p>If the people of Arizona are stupid enough to re-elect this treasonous clown, I hope they enjoy the spectacle of watching him transform himself back into the Angel of Amnesty in November.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Facing reelection, McCain suddenly concerned about illegal aliens.&#8221;</p>
<p>How great it would be to have J.D. Hayworth as the new Arizona senator, but McCain is too strong and firmly entrenched to defeat.</p>
<p>I think most all the retirees will vote for him, and Arizona has a lot of them.</p>
<p>Electing Hayworth would bring us a really solid person in the Senate, and he is definitely anti-establishment, but the same fools who voted to nominate McCain for the pres race will vote him back in office&hellip;unfortunately.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see anybody running who I would like to see run against Obama, but, maybe, Ron Paul.  But Romney and Huckabee both are tremendously more articulate than McCain and would have certainly made a fight of it, but nobody the Republicans had to offer would have brought up the race issue, which is what would have won the race for the GOP, so in the end it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. <br>

		<p>Labor union bosses are against the law, however just as in the federal government, if a vote were taken of the rank and file members, I dare say they would not oppose it, as it is obvious it would not benefit them one iota. However just as in the federal government rank and file be damned. Don&rsquo;t throw the peons in with the power mongers.</p>

		<p>If AR readers are interested in getting a complete education about just how corrupt, treasonous and downright sleazy John McCain has been throughout his entire political career, I suggest that they get a copy of the book &#8216;Guilt By Association&rsquo; by Jeff Gates.</p>
<p>Gates devotes a full chapter to chronicling the &#8216;career&rsquo; of this Judas Goat traitor to America and most especially, a despicable traitor to his own race of people - and it will really open your eyes wide.  </p>
<p>You might want to have a barf bucket handy, when you read the material about McCain, especially after you remember how many millions of pathetically ill-informed whites voted for him in 2008 for President.  </p>

<p>If his position were all that strong he wouldn&rsquo;t have abandoned his precious Mexicans to court the White vote by talking like a real conservative.  <br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to see the transformation of John McCain now that he&rsquo;s in a serious fight for the Senate nomination with J. D. Hayworth.  All of the sudden John McCain, who teamed up with Ted Kennedy for an illegal alien amnesty, is sounding like Tom Tancredo.  He has created an ad where he complains that the border fence hasn&rsquo;t been built, when he voted against it.  How many Arizonans will be fooled?  We all know that McCain will transform right back as soon as he is reelected.</p>
<p>J. D. Hayworth is running from behind and isn&rsquo;t likely to win.  But it would be wonderful if he did.  I&rsquo;d love it if the Presidential candidate of the Republican establishment fails to get reelected in his own state.  Maybe, just maybe, that would send a message to that Republican establishment.<br>
