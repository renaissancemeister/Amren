			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robin Caldwell, The Grio, June 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>How do you win over 1 million-plus people on Facebook?</p>
<p>Entrepreneur Kumi Rauf has taken a simple phrase not unlike James Brown&rsquo;s &#8220;Say it Loud, I&rsquo;m Black and I&rsquo;m Proud&#8221; and the 70s soul affirmation &#8220;black is beautiful&#8221; and created a movement. I Love Being Black is one of the few fan pages on the social network devoted to consistently and unapologetically rallying black people to feel good about who we are.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Love for black culture is evident in the empowering messages found in news stories, quotes by notables and questions that challenge our perception(s) of ourselves, such as &#8220;Should Hollywood cast another non-black Cleopatra?&#8221; I Love Being Black delivers color-affirming messages without politicizing blackness {snip}.</p>
<p>Facebook user Sherri recounts her first impressions of I Love Being Black. The freelance writer says, &#8220;When you first see that group suggestion in your requests that says &#8216;I love being black,&rsquo; and you see the &#8216;confirm&rsquo; under it, it&rsquo;s a no-brainer. It&rsquo;s not a hard sell. You can&rsquo;t help but say yes to that simple phrase. &#8216;Yes, I love being black.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Rauf has sold his page&rsquo;s 1 million and counting fans on a whole lot more than his line of clothing or other items found at his online store. He established the company in 2003 as an outgrowth of racial tension while he was a student at UC Santa Barbara and as a social media platform to encourage positive relations between blacks. For greater accessibility, he is also in the early development stages of creating mobile applications for Android, Blackberry and iPhone users.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While there are other similar fan pages on Facebook, none have been as successful as I Love Being Black in attracting a diverse following that seems to be in need of positive representations of blackness.</p>
<p>{snip} [An] avid social media consumer thinks that &#8220;in a world where you&rsquo;re constantly bombarded with negative images of African Americans, I Love Being Black is a safe haven in the midst of turmoil.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>Too funny. As if blacks, and their actions, are not the very things described, by the very same media, as &#8216;tensions&rsquo;, and as if the &#8216;loving of being black&rsquo; is not going to cause more &#8216;tensions&rsquo;. Or is that contusions?</p>

		<p>A million on &#8220;I Love Being Black&#8221; compared to 13,000 on &#8220;I Love Being White&#8221; on FB?  Remember all the whining a few months ago that Facebook was too white?  Or that the social media realm itself was too segregated?</p>

<p>Truth-in-Advertising translation: In a world where you are constantly bombarded with negative African Americans.</p>
<p>A more useful web-page targeting African Americans might be named, &#8216;I like my fellow whites&rsquo;. And the fact such a web-page &#8216;that you just can&rsquo;t say no to joining&rsquo;, is not bigger than &#8216;I love being black&rsquo;, is proof of nothing other than the most grievous racism, at least, using left-logic, and counting whites as people. <br/>

		<p>I love being white. That is the message we should be teaching our children. Make them aware that white people are only 8% of the world&rsquo;s population. Make sure you tell them it&rsquo;s important to make white babies or our beautiful race will disappear. Parents should warn about the dangers of black and hispanic people and to avoid them whenever possible.  Tell them that as blacks and hispanics only care about their race, so should whites. The key here lies with the parents.</p>

		<p>I am very happy for this news. This means that being black<br/>
amongst blacks is the happiest form of existence. And<br/>
so black neighborhoods with black schools is wonderful right?<br/>
And white neighborhoods with white schools are okay too?<br/>
And if back up Segregation with  absolutely equal budget allowances for blacks, so that no one can scream unfair..then thats the best of all<br/>
worlds ..right?<br/>

		<p>If one has to shout something or reaffirm it publicly, one must have doubts in the deepest recesses of one&rsquo;s psyche. </p>
<p>Nobody is shouting or blogging that 2 + 2 + 4 or that the sky is blue. </p>
<p>Whites don&rsquo;t have to conduct such a mass affirmation. Whites can look to Mozart and Universities and The Industrial Revolution and The Personal Computer and The Internet and Moving Pictures and Recorded Music and The Telephone and All Of The Good Things That Make Up The Modern World and The Ubiquitous White Faces On Beauty Magazines and The Incomparably Great Political System That Obama Has Hijacked and Pepsi, Coke, Levis, and Microsoft.</p>
<p>When one considers the aforesaid, one can deduce that Whites must (or damned well should) love being White.</p>

		<p>I would think that showing yourself a fan of a Facebook group called &#8220;I love to be White&#8221; would endanger your job. Facebook is very public and any group that you are a member of shows up on your profile. It is not unusual to have potential employers peruse applicants profiles. Sad but true.</p>

<p>If by &#8220;negative images&#8221; he means the media then I wonder what planet he&rsquo;s on.  On TV and in the movies black people have such occupations as chief of police, neurosurgeon, head of a government research lab, etc., etc.  The bad guys are almost always white men.</p>
<p>If the &#8220;negative images&#8221; come from the writer&rsquo;s observations of his own black neighborhood, well, that&rsquo;s unfortunate, but reality is what it is whether it makes you feel good or not.<br/>

		<p>On TV, positive images of blacks are everywhere. CSI, NCIS, Law &amp; Order, House, 24, etc. Not to mention commercials.</p>
<p>The only negative images of blacks on TV are from Cops and The First 48. Must be quite a coincidence that those are real-life shows instead of fiction. Funny how that works out.</p>

<p>Hell Yes, &amp; serious doubts, too. People are loudly proud about the most humiliating things.  Those who demand respect the loudest usually deserve it the least. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll know that blacks enjoy being black when they all decide to return to the African Paradise, &amp; live among their delightful &amp; peaceful fellow blacks.  Only wish I could live to see that.<br/>

		<p>Reminds me of a saying I&rsquo;ve heard all my life concerning the mentally deficient. They are just as happy as if they were in their own right mind. None have been as successful at attracting a diverse following? To sorta ditto Bernie #8, it says I love being black, how diverse can it get? To promote a truly diverse minority we should be teaching our children. I love being a conservative Christian, which would sadly probably have a dismal following you could count on one hand. This would be much to the disdain of the majority of the rest of the inhabitants of the earth. Quote: &#8220;In the end times they will be proud of what they should be ashamed of, and ashamed of what they should be proud of.&#8221; &#8220;If you are ashamed of me here on earth I will be ashamed of you before the FATHER.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been racially conscious since I was about 20, so for about 15 years. Still, a group called &#8220;I&rsquo;m proud to be white&#8221; just sounds strange to me. The co-location of the words &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;proud&#8221; has an ugly connotation which, I&rsquo;m ashamed to admit, &#8220;I&rsquo;m proud to be black&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t.  I ascribe this to the power of the message pounded into us day in and day out by the media, our teachers, and our parents, that black solidarity is admirable while white solidarity is reprehensible.  It&rsquo;s sobering that mere repetition this message overrides logic, even in someone who should know better.</p>

		<p>To poster 13.</p>
<p>Just last week, the Mentalist retired its jewish boss of the CBI bureau and brought in a tough as nails, full of hard-knock &#8216;tude black woman as the supervisor of the Mentalist (aka Patrick Jane) and crew.</p>
<p>She was shown to be a hard-hearted and ruthlessly by the book at first, but this week&rsquo;s episode showed her to have a team player side, even though she forced the break up of two white characters who were secretly dating in the office.  </p>
<p>When she was first introduced last week I thought, &#8220;Ugh!  Not another show where the top boss is black and everyone under the boss is white (or asian/latino).&#8221;  Seriously, after this second episode the racial incongruities are so jarring that I&rsquo;m not sure I can continue watching it.  (They seem to have changed writers, as well, as the quality of the episodes have gone way down.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like they&rsquo;re trying to get everyone used to the idea of rule by blacks by putting them in the power broker position in nearly every show on TV.  (The only other type of boss charater you might see is the jewish boss of all the gentiles.)</p>
<p>It seems like we&rsquo;re headed for South Africa-style peonage.  The blacks take over at the top tiers, fire all the whites and hire other minorities.  Then when everything will break, they may let a few of us back in to actually make things work.</p>

<p>Maybe.  Keep in mind, though, that &#8220;the boss&#8221; has a very minor role in many of these dramas.  Most of the actual work is done by whites, which means that whites dominate time on camera. Making a black person the boss, in the world of TV drama, amounts to a kind of tokenism.  <br/>

		<p>I went to the link posted by #19 and read the comments which were, for the most part, a collection of idiotic obscenities written in Afro dialect with a generous helping of the &#8220;F Bomb&#8221; with the maternal prefix. This is what&rsquo;s considered fun these days. <br/>
Yet as #19 said, they stress that they won&rsquo;t tolerate &#8220;racist&#8221; remarks but afroisms such as &#8220;yo ass&#8221; and Mutha f  &mdash;    &mdash;  er&#8221; are fine.<br/>
