<h1><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-10671790">Rise in African Children Accused of Witchcraft</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, July 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An increasing number of children are being accused of witchcraft in parts of Africa, the UN children&rsquo;s agency says.</p>
<p>Orphans, street children, albinos and the disabled are most at risk.</p>
<p>A new Unicef report warns that children accused of being witches  &mdash;  some as young as eight  &mdash;  have been been burned, beaten and even killed as punishment.</p>
<p>The belief that a child could be a witch is a relatively modern development, researchers say.</p>
<p>Until 10-20 years ago, it was women and the elderly who tended to be accused.</p>
<p>The agency says the rise in vulnerable children being abused in this way is linked to greater urbanisation in the continent and disruption caused by war.</p>
<p>The growing economic burden of raising children is also thought to be a factor.</p>
<p>The agency said there was little it could do about the belief in witchcraft itself, and that it was not trying to eradicate the practice. But it said violence against children was wrong, and that it would do everything it could to stop it.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Major problem&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Most of those accused of witchcraft are boys aged between eight to 14  &mdash;  who often end up being attacked, tortured and sometimes killed.</p>
<p>Also, children have had petrol poured into their eyes or ears as a way of trying to exorcise &#8220;evil spirits&#8221; that healers believe have possessed them.</p>
<p>It is reported that some evangelical preachers have added to the problem by charging large sums for exorcisms. One was recently arrested in Nigeria after charging more than $250 for each procedure.</p>
<p>There has been no comprehensive study to suggest how widespread child witchcraft allegations are.</p>
<p>However Unicef&rsquo;s Regional Child Protection officer for West and Central Africa told the BBC more than 20,000 streetchildren had been accused of witchcraft in the DR Congo capital Kinshasa.</p>
<p>Joaquim Theis told the Newshour programme that such children had often been beaten and sent away from their homes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The children would be forced to admit being witches and then asked to tell the accusers who passed on the witchcraft to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Theis said reintegrating affected children remained a &#8220;major problem&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Muti in some places, juju in others. Pervasive and always pernicious. And endemic as would a festering long-term disease. A part of African that cannot be excised, NOT by Christianity or Islam.</p>
<p>African witches in particular are noted for having RED hair. Whitey women with red hair traveling to Africa beware!</p>

<p>   Blacks with red hair are rare but not unknown. I&rsquo;ve heard some Southern blacks say that these red haired blacks are good luck or powerful Gris-gris. They would try to get a lock of red hair for just that purpose. Most Yankees have no idea how superstitious Southern African Americans really are. You don&rsquo;t need to go to Africa to see this sort of thing just come on down to Louisiana or parts of South Carolina. </p>

<p>But Africans did not have written languages until these were introduced from the West, so how do these researchers know that accusing children of witchcraft did not happen in antiquity? How does someone &#8216;know&rsquo; something about societies that were a &#8216;black hole&rsquo; prior to European contact?  How does one research this? Archaeology?</p>

		<p>I knew that once the spotlight of the World Cup faded from South Africa, that the continent would get down to business as usual.</p>
<p>Nothing to see here folks, just Africans being Africans. Move along now.</p>

<p>Interesting that ZA&rsquo;s &#8220;race relations&#8221; bureaucracy is involved, even though they don&rsquo;t tell us who is populating these shantytowns.  These might be white shantytowns, comprised of former government employees who have been ethnically cleansed out of their work in the &#8220;New&#8221; ZA.  B.J. Deller or Concerned South African might be able to fill in the blanks.</p>
