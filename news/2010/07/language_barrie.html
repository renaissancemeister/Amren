<h1>Language Barrier Can Become an Issue During an Emergency</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Latinos, Asians and other immigrants who speak limited English could be in greater risk in a disaster because many cities lack bilingual emergency personnel and communications systems, a new report released Wednesday said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are We Ready for a Disaster,&#8221; prepared by the Asian Pacific American Legal Center and the Tomas Rivera Center, found that while most Southern California cities provide printed disaster materials in Spanish, few provide those documents in Asian languages.</p>
<p>In addition, many cities don&rsquo;t have the resources to provide Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT) training courses in disaster preparedness for residents in languages other than English.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While most cities employ bilingual first-responders, not enough of those personnel speak Asian languages in cities with large Asian populations, while cities with large Spanish-speaking residents lack sufficient first-responder who speak that language, the report said.</p>
<p>Most cities use local radio or TV stations to broadcast emergency messages to resident, but a majority broadcast them only in English, the report found, with city official telling researchers they can&rsquo;t afford to broadcast the</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It said 66 percent of the county&rsquo;s Asian American population was born outside the Unities States and likely to have limited English skills.</p>

		<p>Where I work is the proverbial tower of Babel. </p>
<p>I witness with regularity a Chinese speaker, a Spanish speaker, and an English speaker trying to iron out a difficulty in work, each speaking to one another and not being understood with the degree of accuracy that inspires confidence.</p>
<p>Government jobs such a cops, fire, dispatchers, etc. will in the future or even now will have a REQUIREMENT that conversation fluency in both English and Spanish is A MUST! One more step on the way to dissolution of the U.S. as we know it.</p>

		<p>The law used to be that you had to speak and understand English to become a citizen. I believe it&rsquo;s still the rule, just ignored. Maybe if the government would enforce their own laws there would not be so many problems.Start restricting even the legal entries until this country gets back on track.</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even take a disaster to expose the perils of multicultural mish-mash.  It will create disasters.</p>
<p>We all know how protective-even paranoid corporations can be- when dealing with possible lawsuits against them for endangering consumers. Well get this story, 100% true.</p>
<p>I had the misfortune of living for awhile in the San Francisco east bay area some years back. I went to a Wal Mart one day, and noticed (with utter disbelief) that among the ten or so exit doors of the store, eight were BLOCKED by massive rows of shopping carts (all parked inside the store, and even moored to those shopping cart towing devices). So you get the picture, that these exit doors were blocked very effectively by thousands of pounds of metal&hellip;perhaps on purpose.</p>
<p>I asked some East Indian for the manager&hellip;she couldn&rsquo;t understand me&hellip;no English. (she was in customer service for pete&rsquo;s sake!) She disappeared and a Latino showed up. He could not understand me either. After a couple more stops around the world, an Asian (Vietnamese?) man who could barely make pidgin-English sounds, came up to me. I explained that the blockade of the doors was a very, very serious fire code violation which, in addition to being a ridiculously dangerous situation, would cost Wally World a lot of money, as surely a fire officer would report them.</p>
<p>He did not seem to even be on the same planet. Concern? Knowledge? There was no clue whatever that this man knew or cared what I was talking about. <br>
Maybe it was because it was entirely intentional. The &#8220;rainbow&#8221; of customers at this store were virtually all from other countries, third world of course, where safety and fire codes are either non existent, or are not followed (as in Brazil, where hundreds died piled up like cordwood at the exit of a store&hellip;the owners blocked all but one door, to prevent shoplifting). </p>
<p>Well, the Indo-Asian-Hispanic crew at this Walmart either did not know, care, or were in complicit violation of some very basic, sensible codes we take for granted here in the USA. </p>
<p>Anyway, I actually scolded this manager for daring to let this situation occur. A couple of weeks later, I came back&hellip;Doors still blocked. Later I stumbled upon a high ranking fireman (some kind of brass on his shoulders) from that community, and although he acted with that brain-dead white Californian style of &#8221; I&rsquo;m numb to the horrors of diversity, and jaded beyond recall&#8221;, he did actually seem puzzled that a Wal Mart could do this. </p>
<p>Well, I left shortly thereafter, what a relief. <br>

		<p>Poster #2 is right on.  Where I&rsquo;m at, nearly EVERYONE has a mother tongue other than English.  Do you know how people solve that problem around here?  They just don&rsquo;t talk to each other.</p>
<p>With regards to Asian languages, there are at least ten major ones that can be found in urban areas, and not all Asians can read in their own languages.  The same is true for Spanish.  There are an AWFUL LOT of Spanish speakers who are illiterate in their own written script.  I know quite a few connected with my line of work.</p>
<p>I also believe that in the near future, speaking Spanish will be a de facto requirement for employment just about everywhere.  I&rsquo;m going to enroll my children in spanish language classes so they will have better employment prospects in the future latino states of amerika.</p>

<p>Anybody can act civilized when things are going fine, but it takes a special sort of person to remain orderly and decent during a disaster.</p>

<p>Exactly. And if you the responder just does not understand what is occurring and does not act promptly and correctly, the thought is that YOU DID NOT CARE!!</p>
<p>The anger and frustration will be directed at YOU!!</p>

		<p>This reminds me of the 911 call I listened to years ago. A Chinese guy called in because a group of blacks just walked into his yard and stole his case of beer right out of his vehicle. The 911 operator couldn&rsquo;t understand his accent (I could, though) and had no idea what he was trying to say. Finally he just gave up and hung up. Poor guy. I could just imagine if he had a life-threatening emergency. </p>

		<p>In Milpitas, California there is a whole two story shopping center that appears to be woned/operated by Chinese. The sign were in Chinese only, until the city forced them to put English sings up so the fire department could find them.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think that if some people are too lazy or unwilling to learn English, and they find themselves in an emergency, they have rowed themselves up a PC creek without a paddle. </p>
<p>I do not expect the mentally retarded, the very young ( infants/toddlers), or the old and infirm to master English. These people are in the care of others, and rightfully so.  But it is not an unreasonable expectation to ask that the majority of people master a working proficiency of the English language. Moreover, it is a matter of respect, for the linguistic heritage of the country willing to take you in (or at least put up with you.)  </p>
<p>English ought to be declared the official language of this country.  </p>
