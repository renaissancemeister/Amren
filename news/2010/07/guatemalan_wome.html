<h1>Guatemalan Women Could Get Asylum Due to Murders</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Elias, San Francisco Chronicle, July 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At issue is defining a &#8220;particular social group&#8221; that is persecuted and qualifies for political asylum in the United States. Women who fear genital mutilation or victims of domestic abuse have all been deemed &#8220;social groups&#8221; and granted asylum here.</p>
<p>On Monday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered immigration judges to seriously consider granting asylum to Guatemalan women who fear they will be murdered.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no debate over the country&rsquo;s deplorable murder rate: more than 3,800 women killed since 2000  &mdash;  and close to 800 last year  &mdash;  and fewer than 2 percent of the cases are solved in the male-dominated culture, according to the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at the University of California&rsquo;s Hastings College of the Law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;While we have not held expressly that females, without other defining characteristics, constitute a particular social group, we have concluded that females, or young girls of a particular clan, met our definition of a particular social group,&#8221; Judge Richard Paez wrote for the unanimous three-judge panel.</p>
<p>Such a determination would continue an expansion of asylum eligibility beyond the traditional claims of political and religious oppression. Successful asylum applicants have to show they were persecuted because of religion, political beliefs, race, nationality or membership in a particular social group.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice said it received 3,250 asylum applications from Guatemalans in fiscal year 2009 and granted 155. Only natives of China and El Salvador made more asylum claims  &mdash;  9,336 and 3,458, respectively. The DOJ received a total of 39,279 applications and granted 10,186 asylum requests in the same period.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are an estimated 1.5 million Guatemalans in the United States and migration makes it one of the highest undocumented populations, she [Kelsey Alford-Jones of the Washington D.C.-based Guatemala Human Rights Commission] said. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are about 17 deaths per day in Guatemala City, a city of 2 million. However, experts agree that violence against women is proportionally worse there than in other places.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s scandalous, from the standpoint of a nation, that all women are eligible for asylum just because we are women. But the numbers are there. Statistics show that it (violence) is proportionally higher,&#8221; said Carmen Rosa de Leon Escribano, director of the Center for Education for Sustained development, a nonprofit group that studies violence in Guatemala.<br>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t we just agree to let the entire world come here?  No questions asked.  If you can make it here, your in.  If you can&rsquo;t make it on your own, ask for assistance.  Hell, lets give the whole earth free health care, food stamps, education, free rent and free bonus money for coming here.  No need to work.  Milk us dry if you want.  Hell, lets throw a party for the whole friggin world that lasts for ever!  Just one problem&hellip;.who&rsquo;s going to pay for all of it?  If there is a fourth world country, America will soon be it!</p>

		<p>Anonymous #2, it&rsquo;s almost standard practice here in the United States for a woman seeking divorce and who wants exclusive custody of the children to accuse her husband of violence against her and their children.  This automatically results in an order of protection against the man (no proof required).  When the kids are living with Mom while Dad can&rsquo;t even come over for a visit it&rsquo;s much easier to turn the children against their father, get exclusive custody, and deny any visitation rights to the father.  Women are <i>never</i> prosecuted for perjury or for filing false police reports when they use this now standard divorce tactic.  Yet women profess surprise and anger that men won&rsquo;t commit to marriage.</p>
<p><i>There&rsquo;s no debate over the country&rsquo;s deplorable murder rate: more than 3,800 women killed since 2000 &mdash; and close to 800 last year &mdash; and fewer than 2 percent of the cases are solved in the male-dominated culture, according to the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at the University of California&rsquo;s Hastings College of the Law.</i></p>
<p>So now the problem is that &#8220;male dominated culture&#8221; in Guatemala.  But the same people who whine about &#8220;male dominated culture&#8221; are the same ones who tell us all those indigenous cultures are better than ours.</p>
<p>The real problem we have is Congress, which insisted upon passing a law that says anybody whose life sucks can come to the United States.  Obviously billions of people qualify.</p>

		<p>So let me get this straight.  Guatemalan women get to move to America because they are statistical targets   &mdash;   ie they are members of a group that suffers at the hands of another group, (statistically speaking) called &#8220;Guatemalan men&#8221;   &mdash;   AND they are coming here to escape that evil group and be safe.</p>
<p>So we must have some policy that says the evil group &#8220;Guatemalan men&#8221; must be kept out of America, right? After all, they kill their women, right? And we can only keep the women safe by keeping Guatemalan men away from them, right? I mean, what is the point in letting Guatemalan men come to America if they are wife killers? They are just going to start their wife-killing here in America, right? </p>
<p>Friends, I can guarantee you that the same leftists that are fighting to get Guatemalan women into America are also fighting to get Guatemalan men to move to America, too. </p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care about Guatemalan women. They want to put them on welfare and make you pay to take care of them. The leftists know that Guatemalans will vote for socialism.</p>

		<p>I am soooooooo sick of this stuff!  Not long ago it was Muslim women and African women that qualified to come into our country if they claimed abuse!  Come to find out most LIED and even brought their husbands (boyfriends) with them!  How stupid are we if we do not yell and scream against this population replacement of White Americans?  We all know this has been deliberate and has been ongoing for years!</p>

<p>lol, we&rsquo;ve had a couple of these wars, even, in Bosnia and a new one reported about recently in. . indonesia. . where, the way the newspaper reported the stories, things were only taken serious because of reports women had been raped. If their hadn&rsquo;t been claims women had been raped or abused - coverage of the war wouldn&rsquo;t have been in the Western news media. Are the media perpetuating bias? Creating even more concern for women than there was before? Or are they embarrassing themselves, or perhaps, women? Who knows, but it&rsquo;s what happens when you declare some people more equal than others. It just so happens, it&rsquo;s the left who does so. Even more so than those on the right used to, at least, as claimed by these very same honest leftists&hellip;</p>
<p>To be honest, when I read the caption, &#8220;They&rsquo;re coming soon&#8221;. I got a little bit excited, maybe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time for me&hellip;</p>

		<p>Call me simplistic, but wouldn&rsquo;t it be a better national policy to REQUIRE better conditions in the home countries of these people, than seek to bring them HERE? Perhaps by denying any further aid until rights abuses end?  Most of the &#8220;aid&#8221; ends up in the pockets of the corrupt leaders or the warlords in these countries anyway.  Like one above said, we can&rsquo;t bring the whole world here!  But, like the other above said, it really isn&rsquo;t about abuse - it&rsquo;s about bringing in anybody the politicos deem to be safe Democratic votes, so they can one day (soon) have enough voters to keep them in power in perpetuity.  THEN you&rsquo;ll see a Union of Soviet Socialist Americas real darn quick.  For our own good, of course.  </p>

		<p>Problem is: Guatemalan males are also targets of murder  &mdash;  there is no preferential targeting of females. I think this is another example of judges selectively grabbing bits of social science to support their judgments (just like the Kenneth Clarke testimony that apparently swayed the court during Brown vs. Board of Education).</p>

		<p>This is not about women being persecuted, subjected to genital mutilation, murdered or as victims of domestic abuse.</p>
<p>This is, as Jupiter keeps (correctly) posting, about White replacement.</p>
<p>Nothing more.</p>
<p>WR writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The real problem we have is Congress, which insisted upon passing a law that says anybody whose life sucks can come to the United States. Obviously billions of people qualify&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Only non-Whites qualify, those races, religions and politically persecuted people favored by the left.  The government welcomes parasitic, backwards &#8216;refugees&rsquo; from burma, bhutan and somalia yet denies SA Whites, under threat of genocide at the hands of murderous blacks, refugee status.</p>
<p>From Refugee Resettlement Blog:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I am a White English-speaking South African. In the past two years I have seen and experienced racist acts and policies destroying the lives of me and my husband and the people I know around me. Not one year has passed where my husband and I have not either been mugged, held up at gunpoint, robbed,racially harrassed (racial harrassment is a daily event!)or been in an event where we felt a great threat to our lives, and most often its a combination of the above mentioned. This has happened at such a variety of places that walking around anywhere in Jo-burg is done with your heart in your throat pumping with fear.</p>
<p>Everyday brings with it a number of renewed major and minor traumas, all of which communicate a clear message that your days as a White person in South Africa are numbered&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Outcries from the World-Wide PSM?  Offers of aid and resettlement in the US?  Condemnation of the ANC from the UN?  Celebrities demanding &#8216;awareness&rsquo; of White ethnic cleansing?  Threats from American politicians and world-wide leaders to the SA government to stop the killing of Whites or face military action?</p>
<p>No. </p>

		<p>&#8220;So now the problem is that &ldquo;male dominated culture&rdquo; in Guatemala. But the same people who whine about &ldquo;male dominated culture&rdquo; are the same ones who tell us all those indigenous cultures are better than ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poster #3, you are so right on!  I have talked with so many young white liberal women who have this Avatar-ish inspired fantasy of the &#8216;earth&rsquo; people who are warm, friendly and &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; moreso than us that it&rsquo;s sickening.</p>
<p>It was Madonna who summed up this fascination with tribal cultures in her song La Isla Bonita: &#8220;Beautiful faces, not a care in the world, where a girl loves a boy and a boy loves a girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sadly, the live-lazily-in-a-hut-and-have-sex-with-anything-that-moves kind of lifestyle does not build or sustain a healthy and advanced society.  That&rsquo;s why the Thirld World is still wracked with diseases, inequalities, etc.  Everyone is just singing, dancing, having babies left and right and making no plans for tomorrow.  (This ability to see tomorrow seems to be a strictly Euro-centric habit.)</p>
<p>Poster #7 is also spot on.  I remember when the Haitian earthquake hit and everyone was talking about bringing all the Haitians here (to join the hundreds of thousands already living here and selling dope).  I asked out loud: &#8220;Why can&rsquo;t they go next door to the Dominican Republic, or to Cuba or to Mexico?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I realized that those countries are racist places that do not want blacks, but no one can ever say that in public.</p>

<p>American blacks say they feel unsafe in their &#8216;hoods. Perhaps an African country could right this social unjustice and take some refugees off of our hands for a change?</p>
