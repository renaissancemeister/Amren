<h1><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/19/AR2010071905351.html">Republican Immigration Position Likely to Alienate Latinos, Democrats Say</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael D. Shear, Washington Post, July 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama and his political aides privately acknowledge that the government&rsquo;s decision to sue Arizona over its new immigration law is helping to fuel an anti-immigration fervor that could benefit some Republicans in elections this fall.</p>
<p>But White House officials have concluded that, over the long term, the Republicans&rsquo; get-tough message is a major political miscalculation. They predict it will ultimately alienate millions of Latinos, the fastest-growing minority group in the nation.</p>
<p>West Wing strategists argue that the president&rsquo;s call for legislation that acknowledges the role of immigrants and goes beyond punishing undocumented workers will help cement a permanent political relationship between Democrats and Hispanics  &mdash;  much as civil rights and voting rights legislation did for the party and African Americans in the 1960s.</p>
<p>As a result, although the president is unlikely to press for comprehensive immigration reform this year, he has urged his allies to keep up the pressure on Republican lawmakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look: The Republicans, if you do the math, cannot be successful as a national party if they continue to alienate Latinos,&#8221; said one Democratic strategist familiar with White House thinking on the issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last month, Obama invited a small group of influential Latino activists to the White House and reassured them that he is committed to reform. But to succeed, he said, they had to stop their public complaining about how slowly he was moving and instead direct their fire at Republicans.</p>
<p>The activists came away from their presidential audience still convinced that he could be doing more to push the issue. But their discussion with Obama  &mdash;  and a lengthier one with adviser Valerie Jarrett after he left the room  &mdash;  made one thing clear to them: The White House plans to use the immigration debate to punish the GOP and aggressively seek the Latino vote in 2012.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Advisers to the president say his long-standing position on immigration is not motivated by presidential politics. But in a few years, they predict, the Latino population will surge in &#8220;red&#8221; states, where residents have traditionally voted for Republicans in presidential contests. States such as Texas, which has been a GOP stronghold for a generation, could become permanently &#8220;purple&#8221; tossups if Republicans do not repair their image.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lionel Sosa, who has advised Republican candidates including George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) on Latino issues, said the GOP needs to be careful about how its policies are being received in the Hispanic community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ruy Teixeira, who studies Hispanic demographics for the liberal Center for American Progress, said the growth in the number of Hispanics in states including Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and Texas will give Democrats a significant edge in 2012 unless Republicans find a way to change the way they are perceived.</p>

		<p>Easy answer:  White votes.  Nationally, if you lose 9 Hispanic votes, you only need to gain one white vote to break even, 2 to get in the red.  The ratio is lower in AZ, TX, CO and NV, but is still easy to accomplish.</p>

<p>What rock has this delusional writer been living under? John McCain pandered excessively to Hispanics, even going so far as to say he would offer illegal aliens amnesty. Nonetheless, Hispanics voted for Obama 2 to 1.</p>
<p>Realistically, it would be in the GOP&rsquo;s best interest to stem the tide of mass Hispanic immigration to the United States, legal and illegal alike.</p>

		<p>If these latino voters are going to give the Democrats such huge victories why are they so concerned about Republicans repairing &#8220;damage&#8221; to their image because of immigration.  Why are they giving advice?  Why would they care?  The real strategy is to get the GOP to pander to latinos and anger their White voter base who in turn will turn against them on election day.   </p>

		<p>Republicans had damn well better worry about how their message is received by the rapidly dwindling white majority rather than by the rapidly growing Hispanic minority.  We&rsquo;d better get illegal immigration under control, or pretty soon we won&rsquo;t have a hill to defend.  If that means rounding up illegals en-masse, deporting and stopping further legal immigration of them, let&rsquo;s get to it without further delay.</p>
<p>The only people we should be allowing entry to the USA are white Europeans and Northeast Asians.  We hardly need any more black Africans or Hispanics.</p>

		<p>Favoring amnesty for illegal aliens is certainly going to alienate whites, but no politician ever worries about alienating whites.</p>
<p>If we deported all the illegals and their anchor babies Latinos wouldn&rsquo;t be the biggest minority group in America anymore, so politicians wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about how they vote.</p>

		<p>The Latino voting block doesn&rsquo;t belong here in the first place. The treasonous Democratic imported its voting block from mexico,central america and south america. If Native Born White Americans won&rsquo;t vote for us, we will import a bunch of foreigners who will. The Democratic party has been very open about it&rsquo;s treason.</p>
<p>If the Republican party completetly alienates Native Born White Americans,something will emerge to fill the poltical vacum. Politics abhors a vacum. What emerges may not call itself White Nationalism,but it will effectively be a White Nationalist politial movement, a movement whose main goal is to stop and reverse the race-replacement of the Native Born White American majority at the hands of high fertility post-1965 nonwhites.</p>
<p>The Democratic party is openly the party of nonwhite foreigners. This makes it the party of treason.</p>
<p>The Native Born White American majority hasn&rsquo;t given its consent to being race-replaced at the hand of post-1965 high fertility nonwhites. The Democratic party is a manifestly racist poltical party.</p>

		<p>Yes, and Republicans were told to not offend blacks and lose THEIR vote.  No matter how Republicans pandered to blacks, ignored their destructive behavior, enable their establishment as a block with more rights than Whites, blacks voted and continue to vote 90% or more for the Democratic candidates no matter HOW bad those candidates are.  Same with Hispanics.  Bush pandered to them shamelessly, as did his brother.  McCain betrayed his country for their favor.  Same result.  Hispanics voted 60-80% as a block for the Democratic candidates.  As the other poster stated - all non-White ethnic voting blocks see the Democratic Party as the obvious party most likely to betray their own country and race.  IF Republicans would grow a backbone, truly uphold Constitutional government and law, repudiate the race replacement of their own kind - the race which founded and established this country to it&rsquo;s greatness - and did so fairly with real conviction - they would get in power and STAY in power.  At least they would while we still have a White majority in this country.  We are now down from 90% white to 60% white in a mere 50 years.<br>
Once that ratio tips, this country is lost and becomes like all other third world countries in the world.  Exactly like them.</p>

<p>Finally, someone who understands simple math.  The Hispanic vote is only 8% of the national total; the White vote is around 75%.  Why pander to a group that&rsquo;s never been close to a Republican majority and is outnumbered 9 to 1 by a Republican-majority group? </p>

		<p>The way to try and solve the problem is not to vote out all incumbents, since it is ridiculous to assume all are bad unless you are talking about socialist democrats, get informed and vote out the ones who are on the wrong side of the fence. Nor should we say to hell with republicans, even though they are certainly far from a panacea, but with your throw away protest votes you are only ensuring a dem victory since we still have a two party system. I have yet to see a box for none of the above, and even if there were it would be fruitless to cast such a vote. Due to the present power structure it would be futile to try and change the dem party of the left, however due to the weakness of the republicans we could organize and change their structure, by voting intelligently.</p>

		<p>Steve Sailer has pointed out that the Hispanic vote swings with the white vote, only further to the left. In other words, what turns off whites also turns off Hispanics.</p>

		<p>The more you vote out, the more you buy in.  We only vote on candidates which are pre-chosen for us by the Elitist Supergroups paying for a given platform.</p>
<p>THEIR politics are virtually unknown because they will elect -anybody- that meets a short term set of &#8216;marching order&rsquo; policy goals in an overall longterm plan.</p>
<p>Thus the process of replacing a hated encumbent with a bought inaugural novice it what let&rsquo;s the hidden agendas reset the rage level with &#8216;new hope&rsquo; while themselves accomplishing hated actions incrementally.</p>
<p>It is the ability to largely privately finance campaigns rather than hold fixed-budget government sponsored debates on published platforms and short elected terms with intermediate votes of confidence on those stated goals that we have the kind of &#8216;promise-them-anything but you&rsquo;re beholden to us&rsquo; government by power blocs we do today.</p>
<p>And I think that, by the time the politicians are experienced enough to realize what a stalking horse they are for unpopular programs to which they are backroom wheel-and-deal victims as much as hustlers, it is easier to abandon them than salve their ego&rsquo;s if not their consciences.</p>
<p>As much as 94% of our legislation goes through the Senate unscrutinized and undebated.  Most of the legal wrangling is done in conference and by &#8216;aides and staffs&rsquo; who are a lot smarter on the topics and a lot more agenda driven than the actual legislator.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this the voting group which is and wishes to remain &#8216;alienated&rsquo;, unknown and unseen.  This is the process of governing that has to change.  Or we just trade one leash holder for another, endlessly.</p>

		<p>Latinos, actually meztisos, are the fastest growing minority group in the U.S. That is true. But it could be a miscalculation on the part of the Democrats. More than 60% of the U.S. are white, and perhaps we will finally move to limit the growth of these parasites. And the political power of a party that would sell the country out for amnesty to illegals.</p>

		<p>IMMIGRATION:  THE KISS OF DEATH FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.</p>
<p>The republican party must realize that the more aliens come into the USA (whether legally or illegally), the more democrats there will be and the more likely the democratic party is to win elections.  This is because most aliens are coming from 3rd world countries and tend to be brown and black and the Democratic party appeals to them. </p>
<p>That is exactly why the Democratic party supports a flood of 3rd world invasion  &mdash;  to increase the number of democrats and keep winning elections and have total power and control over the USA.  A totalitarian state with Democrats in total power is their goal.</p>
<p>Immigration is destroying America.  We are already the 3rd most populous nation on earth.  The population flood is creating congestion, traffic jams, reducing wages, causing unemployment and bankrupting our welfare state. </p>
<p>The Republican party would be stupid to not realize this. The Democrats&rsquo; statement is just a trick to help the Republicans walk to their grave.  That is why Republicans must block amnesty and pass laws to ban all immigration.  Immigration is the Republican party`s and America`s kiss of death.<br>

		<p>Support of Arizona&rsquo;s immigration law by white supremacists is not surprising, says Heidi Beirich, a SPLC expert on hate groups, who contends folks who want the United States populated by whites only view the law as one good way to reduce the population of brown people. Now what can we whites do next with<br>
blacks?  The Republican Party of wealthy white men and women, tells,& preaches, that middle and lower income whites support their party as the party of &#8220;white protection&#8221;, yet why <br>
have they not re instituted legal segregation and bring back Jim Crow, in a less mean sprinted way, but if necessary,full mean&#8221;<br>
Drowning out discussion of Blacks is great, &#8220;I love the name calling the Republicans, and Tea Partiers throw out at <br>
them, and we&rsquo;re the real Americans Rhetoric&#8221; But I want to see action, bills, legislation proposals to protect<br>
us with &#8220;tried &amp; true measures before&#8221; 1964 civil rights bill. Most republicans only make proposals<br>
dealing with them, gaining more money for themselves!. What about US? How does any of this help<br>
me put food, rent, gasoline, back-to-school clothes, affording taking my wife who&rsquo;s been sick to a<br>
doctor? and keep my company CEO&rsquo;s from shipping our jobs overseas, to people being paid $2.90 an hr.? I mean, sure I like<br>
hating blacks and people of color and the 1950&rsquo;s, but it&rsquo;s now<br>
2010, and I need food to eat, I&rsquo;am standing in line with with&rsquo;em,<br>
at my neighborhood food bank, cause I&rsquo;ve been unemployed, 17 wks.</p>
