			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chicagoist, July 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While many Cleveland Cavaliers fans expressed their displeasure with NBA star LeBron James&rsquo; departure for the warmer climate of Miami by burning James&rsquo; merchandise in the streets, the team&rsquo;s majority owner Dan Gilbert instead took to the Cavs&rsquo; website, where he hammered out a Comic Sans screed about how Cleveland was &#8220;cowardly betrayed&#8221; by James, and he guaranteed &#8220;that the Cleveland Cavaliers would win an NBA championship before the self-titled former &#8216;King&rsquo; wins one.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}In a statement released by Jackson on Sunday through his organization Rainbow PUSH, he said:</p>
<p> &#8220;[Gilbert] speaks as an owner of LeBron and not the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers. His feelings of betrayal personify a slave master mentality. He sees LeBron as a runaway slave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Albeit a &#8220;slave&#8221; that was made a $120 million offer. Jackson&rsquo;s not the only one making the slavery comparison  &mdash;  in a speech last week Louis Farrakhan called the NBA a &#8220;big plantation&#8221; and said that LeBron is a &#8220;sharecropper,&#8221; and the likening of professional sports to slavery is not a new concept.</p>

		<p>We could easily end the NBA plantation is whites would just stop supporting this glorified form of slavery.  Stay away from NBA games, do not purchase NBA merchandise, do not watch or listen to NBA games.  Only whites can end this new form of slavery and that is by not supporting it.  For once I agree with Jesse, this must end.</p>

		<p>On the contrary James is treated as an icon; a Black icon of course, whom all our kids should emulate and whom all our White daughters should want to date and have sex with so that we can get rid of all the evil White people.  Oh well, if LeBron is not available there are plenty of Black boys and men out there who are just dying for a White woman/women.  This is the message that is being sent by the media.  Since Tiger Woods &#8220;problems&#8221; the media hasn&rsquo;t been able to focus too much attention on Woods&rsquo; exploits so they&rsquo;ve switched to making another Black man a super icon, and that person is James.</p>
<p>On another similar note, all the attention given the World Cup especially by CNN and ESPN has seemed to wane since the top 3 teams turned out to be Spain, The Netherlands and Germany - predominantly White teams.  The top 3 above were just that, and because of that the media attention toward the World Cup gradually diminished as all the teams &#8220;of color&#8221; were eliminated.  Incidentally the African teams had a combined record of 3 wins and 15 losses.  Now a fact like that simply cannot be emphasized by the politically correct media.  No.  Got to be buried.  Another incredible fact is that the captain of each team was forced to read a pre-written script before the game pledging undying loyalty to &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  How&rsquo;s that for Orwellian?  We all know what &#8220;diversity&#8221; means - NO WHITES.</p>

		<p>If Bantu basketball and baseball players still feel like they&rsquo;re on &#8220;plantations&#8221;, why don&rsquo;t they just get up and leave? Here they are, making MILLIONS of dollars in sports, and they STILL have that &#8220;slave mentality&#8221;. So much for &#8220;free at last, free at last, thank God we&rsquo;re free at last&#8221;.</p>
<p>No matter how much money they make and have, or what constitutional rights they exercise in this country, they possess that &#8220;slave mentality&#8221;. They will have it until the day they&rsquo;re shoveled in their graves.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Caucasians should stop paying money to go see these clowns play sports. Don&rsquo;t Caucasians realize, the Bantus take the money and laugh at them?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m a NASCAR fan. There&rsquo;s no &#8220;slave mentality&#8221; there, because ONLY THE WHEELS ARE BLACK!</p>

		<p>How many runaway slaves do you know ran away from $11 million a year and ran to $16 million a year?</p>
<p>Maybe Gilbert&rsquo;s rant was whiny, childish, juvenile, hypocritical, self serving, petulent, and indicative of someone who engages in fire ready aim, but I don&rsquo;t think Gilbert thinks of LeBron as an escaped slave.  Proof of that is that LeBron signing with the Miami Heat and leaving Cleveland to do so was technically a sign-and-trade   &mdash;   If you don&rsquo;t know what that means, it means that James was a free agent, as his contractual obligations with Cleveland were through.  He could have signed directly with Miami, but he technically signed a 6-year $100 million deal with Cleveland, who then traded him to Miami for future draft picks and other consideration.  Cleveland did Miami a favor in doing that by clearing away salary cap (i.e. for the whole team, not individual player salary cap) space in future seasons, and Miami and LeBron did Cleveland a favor in that Cleveland has something in hand in sorta &#8220;exchange&#8221; for LeBron leaving, which they wouldn&rsquo;t have if LeBron did a straight contract with Miami.  </p>
<p>So it could be said that Dan Gilbert traded one slave for several future slaves.</p>
<p>Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s strategy here was insane, because he took a sports-only issue and, like a cancer hitting the lymph nodes, spread it into the world of politics.  Now, conservative talk radio will take it up for the next week.  If JJ was thinking he was helping LeBron (&#8220;I&rsquo;m worried that he&rsquo;s in danger&#8221;), it will actually hurt LeBron, because LeBron will eventually be dragged into a political imbrogliana, unless his moron PR handlers (i.e. former high school teammates with similar 90-ish IQs to LeBron) who (sarcasm on) have done such a great job so far this off-season (sarcasm off) cook up some sort of out.</p>

<p>Black leaders, so called, just have a terrible habit of using language that only infuriates whites - - intentionally or otherwise.</p>
<p>Perhaps, and only perhaps, the black leaders, so called, are doing what they do, speak in the manner that they do, for domestic [black folks] consumption ONLY, but when they say such ignorant things, they make themselves seem just so DUMB!!</p>

A $120 slave.</p>
<p>Gilberts&rsquo; comments such as &#8220;cowardly betrayal&#8221; are over the top (but then, this whole media hyped self-promotion, self-aggrandizement were excessive) but I never would have made the &#8220;runaway slave&#8221; connection had it not been for Mr. Jackson.</p>
<p>Is there anything Mr. Jackson doesn&rsquo;t see through race-colored vision?</p>

		<p>Slavery-fetishism is alive and well in the &#8220;black community&#8221; in America. As much as they affect all this outrage and horror at the institution, they secretly covet and adore this imagery - for alas it is, like so few actual things, THEIRS! Just as they do with ghetto imagery - thugs, pimps, ho&rsquo;s, gangstas and so forth, they adopt and often fetishize virtually anything they can claim as their own. </p>
<p>It seems bizarre and twisted, as all of these symbols are negative, even loathsome in many cases, but American blacks cling to, glorify, or obsess over these things like nothing I have ever seen any other people do in any way or form.  </p>

		<p>Jesse Jackson is merely a con man who goes where the attention is focused to attempt extortion from whitey.  He goes away after a contribution is made to Rainbow Push, from which he takes a hefty cut as a salary, bonus, or whatever.  <br>
White people should have stopped believing that he can call down riots with the wave of his hand, so he may be nothing more now than a powerless blowhard.  He does however serve to remind everyone of the way ghetto-bred blacks operate.</p>

		<p>I was in a restaurant that had that moronic spectacle of an interview on. White people have to be fully out of their mind&rsquo;s. The spectacle had remote shots of sport&rsquo;s bar&rsquo;s from Cleveland, Maimi, and New York. In everyone of them not less than 99% of the zombie&rsquo;s watching the spectacle were White. That in addition to the fawning and slobbering interview by a White leaves one to ask what the hell is wrong with this race? </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s another PR crisis looming for the NBA:  David Stern fined Dan Gilbert $100,000 today.  Now, this fine is because of the acidic tone of his letter.  This is something Stern should have done the next day.  But the timing is unfortunately problematic, because it&rsquo;s the day after Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s lunatic rantings.  Therefore, people are going to get it in their heads that David Stern reacts to whatever Jesse Jackson wants.  </p>

		<p>Black professionnal are not slaves, of course. But in a way, they are like Roman gladiators, used for entertainment.</p>
<p>The thing is, it never would have occured to the Romans to pay their gladiators so well that they ended up being part of the richest people in their own society&hellip; let alone offering their daughters to them!</p>
<p>I think what should be done, is to give Blacks their own state, among your union of 50 states, and let them live their lives without affirmatice action and the like. Of course, that state would be the poorest, and backward, but if they lived in their own separate society, there would be no Tiger Woods or Michael Jordan. </p>

		<p>Humorous aside   &mdash;   Someone I follow on Twitter re-tweeted a tweet by Rudy Gay, who was a free agent this year, late of the Memphis Grizzlies, but re-signed with them.  A few hours before the NBA free agency period started, he tweeted (pph) &#8220;I&rsquo;ve been in the league for four years, and a in a few hours, I&rsquo;ll get to see where I can go to grow and reach goal to be one of the best in the league.  Wish me luck!&#8221;  I responded directly to him:  &#8220;Next year, you&rsquo;ll make more money than I&rsquo;ll see in my lifetime.  You don&rsquo;t need or want any of my luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>His new contract?  5 for 82.  Meaning that he retained his existing slave master on the same plantation.  In Memphis no less, historically the home to the world&rsquo;s largest spot market for all that slave-harvested cotton.</p>
<p>Oh well, at least there&rsquo;s always that white privilege I can fall back on.</p>
