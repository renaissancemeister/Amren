<h1>U.S. to Senegal Car Theft Ring Busted, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rob Sgobbo, Joe Jackson, and Brendan Brosh, New York Daily News, June 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thieves snatched Toyotas, Mercedes-Benzes, BMWs, Infinities and Range Rovers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to resell in Africa and the U.S., state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NYPD, state police and attorney general&rsquo;s Organized Crime Task Force snared 17 exporters, &#8220;steal men,&#8221; brokers, a garage attendant and two Toyota dealership employees after a year-long investigation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ring is accused of swiping more than 450 vehicles in the past year in a scheme that could have been a sequel to &#8220;Gone in 60 Seconds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orders were placed with the &#8220;steal crew&#8221; specifying make, model, year, color and even accessories.</p>
<p>The crew searched for a car that matched, then lifted it using a key taken from a Toyota dealership or a laptop to reprogram the cars and keys.</p>
<p>The hot wheels were then stashed for a few days at one of four parking garages in the Bronx to be sure they didn&rsquo;t have tracking devices.</p>
<p>Eventually, the cars were given new vehicle identification numbers and ID tags and shipped via the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal in crates marked &#8220;household goods.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buyers in Senegal paid $25,000 or more for the cars. Others went to buyers in the tristate area as well as Georgia and Texas.</p>

		<p>Pray tell, how are trans-Atlantic boats with cars stashed in deceptive crates allowed to leave the harbor without being checked by some law enforcement authorities?  A car is large, household goods are small.  Why are such small goods being transported in such large containers, I would ask if I were CG checking out this boat.  Am I naive in thinking that they are spot-checked?</p>

		<p>Naw. They aren&rsquo;t all black. Check out the fat Guidos at the head of the line. After 100 years in America the Africans will have proven their chops as the Guidos have and will be able to get their own TV show: &#8220;African Sopranos&#8221;.</p>

		<p>In Canada, stolen cars are shipped from ports on the east and west coasts in outbound shipping containers which are seldom checked.</p>
<p>Because of Lebanese immigrants, Lebanon has long been a destination for stolen Canadian autos, some ending up in the hands of Islamic terrorist groups.</p>

		<p>@1,</p>
<p>I think they are using deceptive terminology when they say &#8216;crates&rsquo;.  If the video provided in the article LINK is accurate, that semi truck is carrying a _shipping container_ which means that these cars are ending up on vessels that look like this-</p>
<p><a href="/2009/04/container-ship.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://isbu2you.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/container-ship.jpg</a></p>
<p>And when that container ship leaves port with several hundred pods onboard, I doubt if the USCG or Customs or whatever are going to be comparing bills of lading against individual containers.</p>
<p>What is -supposed- to happen (post 9/11) is that guaranteeing the authenticity of the cargo is shifted to being the responsibility of the vetted and insured international cargo transporter.  Who has to have all the material items registered as far back as the factory they come from before he commits them to any international delivery.</p>
<p>Having a paper trail prevents you haing to install X-Ray machines, gamma spectrometers or cameras inside each container to monitor the loading sequence.  All based on the assumption that the owner of the shipping company would prefer not to face massive penalties or lose his license.</p>
<p>Clearly someone bypassed that anti-terrorism measure and, along with the VINs and other documents, I am suspicious that this was probably someone rather high up the food chain with contacts in one of the big Administrations/Agencies.</p>
<p>Since the shirt facers we see are just the &#8216;steal men&rsquo; and their street bosses, you can rest assured that the one who got away was probably a suit and may well be federal him/herself.</p>
