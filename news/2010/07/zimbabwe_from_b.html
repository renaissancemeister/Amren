			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rosie DiManno, The Star (Toronto), July 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>From breadbasket of Africa to African basket case  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>A country rooted in agriculture that now must import maize and wheat, 7 million of its people targeted for assistance this year by the World Food Program.</p>
<p>At least 85 per cent of the population is unemployed, 49 per cent malnourished according to WFP figures, with 83 per cent living on less than $2 a day.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe: Once the regional model of an African country functioning at maximum capacity; for the past decade in utter economic collapse, wracked by multi-trillion per cent inflation until the Zimbabwe dollar was shelved for U.S. currency last year.</p>
<p>The government blames a nation&rsquo;s misery on international sanctions and chronic droughts.</p>
<p>The world blames Zimbabwe&rsquo;s woes on President Robert Mugabe, his Zanu-PF thugocracy, endemic corruption and the catastrophe of land redistribution.</p>
<p>Out of some 6,000 large white-owned commercial farms in 2000, less than 300 remain, with half of those facing eviction orders, 80 seized in the year since a unity government was brokered between Zanu-PF and the Movement for Democratic Change. That indicates very little has actually changed, even with MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai installed as prime minister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reform?&#8221; says Deon Theron, posing the word as a rhetorical question and simultaneously sneering. &#8220;Reforming from productive to unproductive, more like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Theron is president of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s ever-shrinking Commercial Farmers Union, which essentially represents Zimbabwe&rsquo;s ever-shrinking constituency of white farmers. Since land resettlement legislation in 2000  &mdash;  taking back for black rural farmers, allegedly, what the white colonizers had staked unilaterally in centuries past  &mdash;  the country has been in economic free fall, unable to feed itself, arable property lying fallow, mud-hut dwellers working tiny plots and selling their produce by the side of the road where formerly massive crop yields were sold to foreign markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s been devastating,&#8221; says Theron, 56, himself among the white commercial farmers  &mdash;  raising dairy and beef cattle  &mdash;  divested of property without compensation, living now on his mother&rsquo;s farm, though the elderly woman has also been ordered off her land, despite a High Court ruling that she is the legal owner.</p>
<p>The narrative of white owners driven off their farms by invaders, often violently by youth militia mobs  &mdash;  police looking the other way because they refuse to intervene in anything &#8220;political&#8221;  &mdash;  has been well-documented since 2000. Yet it&rsquo;s the far more numerous black farm workers who&rsquo;ve suffered most as their jobs disappeared, the land usurpers  &mdash;  primarily government and &#8220;parastatal&#8221; officials, Zimbabwe&rsquo;s cronies  &mdash;  hopelessly inexperienced at commercial farming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dispiriting to drive across this country&rsquo;s highways, looking upon mile after mile of disused land, the Rhodes grass waist-high where once neat furrows of crops were cultivated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mugabe&rsquo;s policies have destroyed the symbiotic relationship between commercial farmers and small scale farmers,&#8221; explains Theron. &#8220;They claim to be empowering black citizens but only a small handful of individuals have benefited, Mugabe and his friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just look at the figures:</p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2008, production of maize declined 79 per cent, wheat 90 per cent, soya beans 66 per cent, citrus 50 per cent, fresh produce 61 per cent, dairy 59 per cent, beef 67 per cent, coffee 92 per cent, tea 40 per cent. Only tobacco, a major foreign currency generator, has rebounded markedly in the last year from a nearly 80 per cent decline.</p>
<p>Theron&rsquo;s personal story shares all the hallmarks of Mugabe&rsquo;s assault on white land owners. Three farms Theron bought after Rhodesia/Zimbabwe&rsquo;s independence in 1980  &mdash;  none of it inherited  &mdash;  have been seized, with all of the equipment. &#8220;They attacked us. They beat up my employees. They slept in my bed, ate my food, drank my beer. They poisoned my dogs and they almost killed me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because he refused to vacate his mother&rsquo;s farm, Theron was charged and convicted in an absurd kangaroo court trial where the first magistrate had himself taken over a white-owned farm, the second scolded Theron to &#8220;face the music for your illegal occupation of the land&#8221; and the third refused to allow the defence to present any evidence or call witnesses.</p>
<p>Theron is appealing the six-month sentence handed down two days before Zimbabwe&rsquo;s last national elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were desperate for a conviction to show that they were standing up for the rights of black farmers. But very few ordinary people have been given any land.&#8221;</p>
<p>Further, Theron adds, urban Zimbabweans graduating from college have no wish to farm; they don&rsquo;t want to work with their hands, would prefer to sit in front of computers and do technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, I&rsquo;m not opposed to land redistribution. We all know the colonial history of this country. But what happening isn&rsquo;t land reform. It&rsquo;s thuggery.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has to be some respect for the rule of law. There has to be restitution and respect for property rights. There has to be an independent judiciary. We don&rsquo;t have any of that right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>There have been small glimpses of progress. The Southern African Development Community, representing regional countries, has ruled in favour of ousted farmers in land ownership disputes and is threatening action against Zimbabwe for refusing to recognize its decisions. Zimbabwe&rsquo;s High Court has likewise rendered verdicts acknowledging rightful ownership of property. South Africa&rsquo;s ambassador intervened successfully on behalf of its nationals who were tossed off farm they owned here. The German embassy this month forced Zimbabwe to back off its eviction of a huge farming enterprise owned by a German citizen, threatening to withhold $50 million in humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>Theron estimates it would cost upwards of $12 billion to compensate white farmers evicted from their property. &#8220;The government doesn&rsquo;t have that kind of money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zimbabwe&rsquo;s prolonged economic derangement and the resultant collapse of the country&rsquo;s social infrastructure has been entirely self-afflicted. The government is in staggering debt yet continues to discourage the foreign investment acutely needed to get off its knees. Recent legislation now requires that large foreign-owned companies sell a majority share interest to indigenous Zimbabweans, described as &#8220;formerly disadvantaged&#8221;. That kind of unfriendly investment climate has put Zimbabwe  &mdash;  which pulled out of the Commonwealth in 2003  &mdash;  on the wrong side of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>The international community also has watched with dismay as Mugabe has thwarted key provisions of the Global Political Agreement that forced power sharing on Zanu-PF  &mdash;  promises to conduct a thorough land audit, to reorganize security forces, to appoint MDC governors and to end arbitrary detentions of political opponents and activists.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, farm seizures continue unabated.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe cannot possibly begin to heal itself as long as the agriculture sector remains in such colossal disarray.</p>
<p>Yet Theron, among others, is hopeful.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can still turn this around. Look at the way we stopped the runaway inflation, when all the shops were empty, no food on the shelves. The people did that, by refusing to use Zimbabwe dollars anymore and that forced the government to change their policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe we can get back on our feet again pretty quickly, with some decent governance. The agriculture industry will come back. This has always been an agriculture-driven economy  &mdash;  agriculture and foreign investment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Salvation might be just a heartbeat away  &mdash;  Mugabe&rsquo;s heartbeat. He&rsquo;s 86-years-old. And he&rsquo;s almost single-handedly holding the widely discredited Zanu-PF together.</p>
<p>&#8220;He still has a great deal of respect throughout Africa,&#8221; says Theron. &#8220;He&rsquo;s stood up against all the odds. Absolutely, he&rsquo;s a great patriot. But nobody else in the party has that kind of immunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;His death will change everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, Theron offers a sheepish smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a Zimbabwean. If you&rsquo;re going to remain in this country, you&rsquo;ve got to be an optimist.&#8221;<br>

<p>That is the problem. Robert is respected. That is the problem. He should not be respected but he is.</p>
<p>And the situation will problably become worse when Robert is gone. The various factions will squabble and fight among themselves to see who will attain power and it will be a bloodbath.</p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t the whites in these countries simply move and let the locals starve? I&rsquo;d propose that the US have a massive airlift to bring in these white refugees, but we all know they&rsquo;re the wrong skin color. The US only accepts in dysfunctional and unskilled third worlders. We don&rsquo;t seem to want skilled and industrious whites any more. </p>

IAN SMITH DIES: BBC NEWS (2 min, 21 sec. video summary)<br>
&ldquo;Ian Smith dies aged 88,&#8221; November 20, 2007<br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2e2wftc" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2e2wftc</a></p>
<p>Excerpts:</p>
<p>BBC: &ldquo;Ian Smith believed Africans could never run their own countries.  He went to his grave convinced he was right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the 1960s, Ian Smith, as Rhodesia&rsquo;s prime minister, defied the winds of change bringing independence and black rule to Britain&rsquo;s colonies.  White Rhodesians wanted independence from Britain but without handing power to the black majority.  This was unacceptable in Britain.  Harold Wilson&rsquo;s Labour government was plunged into its first real crisis &hellip;Talks went nowhere.  Ian Smith rebelled and in November, 1965, he made his unilateral Declaration of Independence &hellip; The British [eventually] dismissed Smith and his cabinet, but the [now] illegal regime carried on and didn&rsquo;t seem to care much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SMITH: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in black majority rule EVER in Rhodesia, not in a thousand years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BBC: &ldquo;It was black-armed opposition which eventually forced change &hellip; Robert Mugabe emerged as the new leader.  But now, 27 years after independence, President Mugabe has reduced Zimbabwe to ruin, its agricultural riches destroyed, food in desperately short supply, with hyper-inflation running out of control and any and all political opposition met by violence and repression.  Ian Smith felt vindicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SMITH: &ldquo;Standard of education and health and housing for our black people of any other country in the African continent.  That was what Rhodesians did, and I wonder if we shouldn&rsquo;t be given credit for doing that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BBC: &ldquo;But the world did not tolerate Ian Smith&rsquo;s rebellion to prevent black majority rule.  He lived his life out of step with the times&hellip;&rdquo; </p>

<p>Notice the local &#8220;starving&#8221; population, the population living on 2 dollars a day, the population that depends completely on the outside help of an international group made up mostly of white people - do nothing to stop the attacks on white farmers that have left their country in ruins.  Amazing, isn&rsquo;t it?  Everyone knows there is a direct correlation between the prosperity of that country and the number of white owned farms yet the local population which could rise up in revolt does nothing - because they&rsquo;d rather be starving and poor on their own than be normal and have to thank white people - that is how deep their racism runs.</p>

		<p>This is what you get when idiot white liberals and leftist media clowns push an agenda which suddenly shifts power to blacks for no good reason. </p>
<p>Seriously, Zimbabwe is so far gone it&rsquo;s never coming back no matter who is in charge. The reason the nation is starving is obvious - the low IQ masses attacked and destroyed the white farmers for basically being white and productive without stopping to think what exactly would happen if the farms shut down. In ten years, according to the article, 95% of the country&rsquo;s white farms disappeared.</p>
<p>For black Africa as a whole, and not just Zimbabwe, the party will really be over when the last whites leave (before they are killed) and the international aid dries up thanks to the worldwide recession. Mass starvation in third-world African countries filled with violent, impulsive populations having an average IQ of 70 is not a recipe for progress.</p>
<p>This story has been played out again and again and again over the decades, even over the centuries. How much more proof of a dangerous genetic difference does any sane person need? The forced mixing of Africans into civilized white cultures that incredibly encourage and pay for this &#8220;privilege&#8221; is the true threat to the planet. Until whites summon the courage to face this reality - and take the necessary action - we are doomed.<br>

If this is what they want let them have it &amp; stop whining about Zimbabwe. They made the choices not the &#8216;racist&rsquo; white people.<br>
If the whole lot of them starve that&rsquo;s the choice the people made themselves. If they want to live well they have a lot of hard work ahead of them.  Maybe an African Renaissance that African leaders brag about.<br>
GET ON WITH IT &amp; stop complaining!!</p>

		<p>The Chinese are behind this. They funded Mugabe. The Chinese want the white farmers out of Zimbabwe so that the Chinese can come in and control the resources in Africa. </p>
<p>The Chinese know that the black Africans will be (relatively) docile if they depend on food rations rather than being able to be fed by the white farmers.</p>

&#8216;Who Cares?&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Well, we should for one.  IMF and World Bank are just fronts for Elite investment groups (like the one which threw some weight to maintain a presence via that German farm) and they are holding things together for just one reason: when things get really bad, probably starting with a white massacre and then running down through the ranks of the society as a whole, they can go in _with troops and guns_.</p>
<p>And lay waste before starting over.</p>
<p>There is a vanishing small number of wealth generation opportunities in the West.  Collapsing countries represent one of them as these so-called multinationals get to effectively create a nation from nothing with ZERO oversight because THEY ARE &#8216;the UN&rsquo;.  Imagine what that must be like: roads, power, water, medical, housing.  Anything that can make money.</p>
<p>And these groups operate so far behind the line of reported news that the only way you ever catch them is in the manner by which their nationalist mercenary forces are criticized for their &#8216;brutality&rsquo; in occupying &#8216;innocent&rsquo; lands.  Just like Iraq.</p>
<p>And just like Iraq, if you **don&rsquo;t** go in with intent to recreate a corporate order (which is why the whites have to go, permanently, so that there is no record of prior ownership) that supercedes the nominal sponsoring State/s; someone else will (French ELFI oil production rights in the Majnoon fields for instance).</p>
<p>If Rhodesia wants an out, they need to start by acknowledging that their drouts are not just going to &#8216;go away in time&rsquo; and so will require a long and very expensive desalinization/pumping system to be set up in eastern neighboring Mozambique with the water brought inland at least 250nm and held in large reservoirs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to take some serious money and that&rsquo;s going to mean China if not the West.  China is exactly the kind of country which would cut in line on the Mugabe &#8216;wait for death&rsquo; scenario, dealing with Mugabe as the sole despot in charge and then nominating his successor rather than allow hundreds of &#8216;like minds&rsquo; begin a genocidal campaign to test each other&rsquo;s strengths.</p>
<p>As will otherwise arise in the aftermath of the Zanu-PF.</p>
<p>In trade for a continuing payout to X to basically do whatever he wanted with, the Chinese would expect &#8216;enclave&rsquo; hegemony over entire regions of the country and would drive out and exclude those areas from African participation, which they know better than to trust.  They might even bring the white farmers back, though it would be as managers not be as owners.</p>
<p>And the West would say nothing, as they already do about many of China&rsquo;s African holdings, because it is embarrassing to be beaten at your own game of robber baron capitalism (I&rsquo;m convinced that overweaning &#8216;human rights&rsquo; politics is about 90% of the reason why America&rsquo;s elites are actually sabotaging this country as well&hellip;).</p>
<p>This is the reality of Zimbabwe right now.  A land waiting for an excuse to be overrun so that companies that owe allegiance to no one can &#8216;save&rsquo; it.  For themselves.</p>
<p>Humanitarian, no?</p>

		<p>You know, at the end of the day, we&rsquo;re creating our mess in the States.  Big coomercial farms are importing/enabling illegal immigrants as fast as they can to work the fields.  In 20 years time, we have low IQ latinos all over the country, everywhere.</p>
<p>Soon they will outnumber us, then they will take control.  Think it&rsquo;s a fantasy?  Don&rsquo;t you look more than 20-30 years down the road?  Obviously, with all current trends in place, by 2100 this WILL be a Latino nation with small groups of embattled whites, asian and blacks in little enclaves.</p>

<p>Actually, all (or at least most) of those things DID happen to Zimbabwe when they declared unilateral independence, back in 1964 I think. The thing is, however, back then it was Rhodesia, and it had a white government. So, you are absolutely correct. Doing something like that will get you in deep water if your leaders are white, but if your leader is black, fighting such a process could even be considered &#8220;imperialist.&#8221;</p>

Rhodesia, as we all know is destroyed beyond repair, and South Africa is moving rapidly downward with raging crime figures and incompetrent blacks running things.  They&rsquo;re not quite at Zimbabwean levels yet, but it won&rsquo;t be long before they are.</p>
<p>Under black rule, in one and one-half years the United States is on the precipice of collapse with incompetent blacks and their white lackeys creating a multi-trillion dollar debt that can never be repaid, especially since the US has lost its powerful industrial manufacturing base.  </p>
<p>US sub-primes on millions of homes to non-whites not only started the dominoes falling in the US, they continued over into Europe.  On top of their huge payouts to imported third world hordes, Europe was economically spiraling downward, but the toxic debt they bought from US banks put the coup de gras to them and now they&rsquo;re in worse shape than America.  </p>
<p>Like Rhodesia and South Africa, the white economies are collapsing. Will the US be overtaken by mestizos in the Southwest and blacks throughout the rest of the country, while most all of Europe falls to the dictates of Sharia law?</p>
<p>Does South Africa, Rhodesia, and the Middle East War Lords, give us a view of what is in store for the West, especially now that the US is under black rule and the UK has decided that Sharia law should be implemented right along with English law?</p>
<p>Have you ever learned of any nation in history so eager to do good they destroyed themselves and their people in the process?</p>

		<p>So what if blacks starve in Zimbabwe! when they become hungry enough they will learn to farm. The whites had a tremendous advantage becuase of their superior skills&hellip;.skills not possessed by blacks. Of course Rhodesia is gone and with it prosperity&hellip;yet the average african cannot comprehend beyond his little patch of dirt and never will. my bet is that 50 years from now little will have changed from today.</p>

		<p>The farmers of Zimbabwe are also among the dogooders. They want to keep and help their african workers and farm to fill up the african fastreproducing population. Mugabe is on the other hand curbing their population.</p>

		<p>I really have little sympathy for the white farmers who insist on staying in Zimbabwe, and even expecting &#8220;justice&#8221;. They&rsquo;re like little boys who think they can stop a charging elephant with a popgun.</p>
<p>Let a hundred flowers bloom on Zimbabwe&rsquo;s grave. Let a hundred jackals contest over her remains.</p>
<p>No American or international aid to Zimbabwe. Not now, not ever.</p>

<p>This is why this outrageous whites-hating government keeps lasting so long. When Germany threatened to withhold their aid that kleptocratic government backed off. If the world would stop feeding that stupid country the Government would probably fall soon and real progress could be made.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not really hard to see why.  Though it&rsquo;s understandable the BBC isn&rsquo;t giving him credit.  Can&rsquo;t give those &#8220;white supremacists&#8221; credit, even when they prove themselves right over and over again.  </p>

		<p>Robert Mugabe is respected only by other dictators. He isn&rsquo;t very well respected by the people of Zimbabwe, because there is large scale opposition to him, even though he uses his media, courts, and schools to brainwash his subjects.</p>
<p>His attack on whites is genocide, of a former population of 350,000 less than 50,000 still manage to live under severe government repression. The way his government has treated the white minority is absolutely intolerable if it was against any other people. Why than is it not reported more in the media - that such oppression exist?</p>
<p>I mean where are the Jews and ADL? They have no problem sticking up for minorities in America that are allied with them, yet, they ignore a small minority population who face laws similar to the laws their ancestors faced. There is no different between black economic empowerment, land redistribution, quotas, Affirmative action, the black kangaroo courts, and Zimbabwe&rsquo;s version of the SS (the Zanu-militias and government backed mobs)that terrorize and dehumanize whites in Zimbabwe than what Jews faced in Germany.</p>
<p>It is not a valid point at all either to blame whites for what they had in Zimbabwe on colonization. Whites didn&rsquo;t just walk into a land paved with Gold when they immigrated to Zimbabwe, no whites like those of South Africa fought hard to build what was created. I&rsquo;m sick of whites who settle other lands being called colonizers, no we were immigrants. Why are we dehumanized as colonizers when for example Muslims to Europe and Mexicans to US are called immigrants, even though they are actively colonizing large parts of Europe, building Mosque, promoting their culture, creating no go areas, etc.</p>

		<p>Most blacks benefit from benevolent paternalism.  For this to work, there must be affection, respect, and concern on both sides.  Because this has not worked in Africa, I hope the Chinese take over the role the whites performed poorly.  The Chinese seem interested in doing so.  </p>

		<p>During 1976 I attended a speech by a member of the Zimbabwe African National Union.  At the time it was fighting against the white majority regime of Ian Smith in Rhodesia.  During the question and answer period I said, &#8220;I expect you to be victorious. Nevertheless, the standard of living of every black African country has declined since the end of colonial rule.  Why do you think Zimbabwe will be an exception?&#8221;<br>
 <br>
He gave an equivocal answer which implied that if I was a good person, I would not have asked such a question.  Because I was a friend of the host of the gathering, I pretended to consider his to be an acceptable answer. <br>

Racial egalitarians should look down from their lofty ideals to look at the results on the ground that their political victories often lead to.   </p>

<p>The usually quoted peak white population is 250,000 though it may have been around 275,000.  I haven&rsquo;t seen any reliable figures for how many remain but I very much doubt it is 50,000 - probably more like 20,000 and most of them elderly.  </p>
<p>Rhodesia was MURDERED and the culprits have never been arrested.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a little too easy to blame Mugabe for the ongoing debacle that is Zimbabwe. Had any of the other black insurgent leaders ended up as president, it would have made no difference. They would have wrecked the country just as thoroughly as most of the rest of black-ruled Africa has been wrecked. </p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Ian Smith believed Africans could never run their own countries. He went to his grave convinced he was right.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>In his book, Smith used the line &#8220;I told you so!&#8221; And he was right. </p>
