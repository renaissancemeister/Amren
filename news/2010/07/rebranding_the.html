<h1>Rebranding the Afrikaner: World Cup Watershed?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Wyatt, CNN, July 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Organizers of the 2010 World Cup hoped the soccer tournament could provide a catalyst for a &#8220;re-branding&#8221; of South Africa, and arguably there is no group within the Rainbow Nation that needs this makeover more than the Afrikaner community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Making up just under six percent of the population  &mdash;  numbering around three million from an overall population of nearly 50 million according to the 2007 Community Survey  &mdash;  it is the white Afrikaner people that were most closely associated with the ruling elite of the racist and oppressive apartheid regime that existed from 1948 to 1994.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a long time that Afrikaners were perceived to be the polecats of the world, it is something we have to live with,&#8221; Tim Du Plessis, editor of Afrikaans newspaper Beeld told CNN.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Afrikaans language, which is the third most spoken in South Africa, like much of the group&rsquo;s culture is entwined with the country&rsquo;s recent divisive past; the plan to enforce the teaching of Afrikaans in black schools sparked the violence of the Soweto uprising of 1976 in which 23 students died after police opened fire.</p>
<p>It was the tradition of Christian conservatism and social conformity as well as the shackles of a problematic past, which drove musicians Francois van Coke and Wynand Myburgh to show a new face of their community through music.</p>
<p>As part of punk outfit F****polisiekar  &mdash;  which is an expletive-laden Afrikaans&rsquo; phrase for &#8220;go away police car&#8221;  &mdash;  the Cape Town-based band has expressed their situation by singing in Afrikaans since 2003.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think with [our] music we were saying we&rsquo;re not part of that whole Afrikaner mentality, our first album was an outlet for that and the songs were quite angry. Things need to change,&#8221; lead singer and guitarist Van Coke told CNN.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The controversial band&rsquo;s socio-political songs and questioning of the Christian faith have seen them become pariahs in their own community, but as one of South Africa&rsquo;s most popular groups  &mdash;  who have toured with the White Stripes and Metallica  &mdash;  they are helping to redefine the Afrikaner.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a lot of talk about our language dying out, there is fear and anxiety that our identity will be lost. My point of view: we&rsquo;ve never been pro-Afrikaner or pro the Afrikaans language  &mdash;  we just are who we are, like or not. The most important thing is for people to give it space to breath, to grow, to allow change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Change is good, [the Afrikaner community] should take on a new face. Trying to hold onto what went before, to keep it the same is never going to work. There are a lot of people who are proud of being Afrikaans, and I get a lot of emails saying that because of our music they&rsquo;re proud of being Afrikaner again or that they think Afrikaans is cool,&#8221; Myburgh added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Before the World Cup it felt like the country had gone back 15 years, the way things were going. But I think the greater majority of South Africa want a unified country,&#8221; Van Coke said.</p>
<p>And for a community that is almost defined by an all-consuming passion for the &#8220;Springbok&#8221; national rugby union team, the irony that a new national image and that unity could be forged via a soccer event, traditionally a black sport, was not lost on skeptical Afrikaners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prior to the World Cup our readers were indifferent to the event. Our sport coverage was rugby, rugby, and rugby; even in the off-season. But now I hear stories all the time of Afrikaans people who were not interested in soccer, glued to their televisions watching the World Cup. Currently we have saturation coverage, and the readers like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Du Plessis added the hosting of a big event had resonated with many Afrikaners: &#8220;They feel a bit alienated, because it&rsquo;s been a very black dominated World Cup .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and no white footballer played a game for Bafana Bafana, but they feel good that we&rsquo;re showing well on a global stage.</p>

		<p>The only reason why the Afrikaners were viewed as the polecats of the world is because of the demonization by the controlled main stream media. This was necessary because the money power wanted control over the South African mineral fields. this scenario we have seen being played out many times, when a third world country has what is wanted by a 1st world country, like for instance Iraqi oil. Read &#8220;Confessions of an economic hit man&#8221;</p>
<p>Murders were much, much less during the 42 years the apartheid government ruled South Africa, therefore the life expectancy was much higher.<br>

<p>If you consider that murder is the utmost expression of evil it would be correct to say that South Africa today is much, much more evil than the apartheid South Africa. </p>

		<p>I agree with much of what you say but I think people need to realize that it&rsquo;s not just evil but -different-.  For a black who never had much and may never have much, murder is rather like a trial by combat in our medieval period.</p>
<p>Something that, if he can just get away with it &#8216;in the act&rsquo;, will not only mark him as a man among his friends and fellows but also as &#8216;not guilty&rsquo; of whatever crime the act was associated with.</p>
<p>Of course, where things get a bit twisted, is that if a black South African commits a crime of theft or rape it has to be against whites who have more than he does for it to mean much.  </p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t live by that code.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if he brings along a couple &#8216;witnesses&rsquo; to his coup taking, the odds of it being a fair fight go down even more.</p>
<p>ZA is the rape capital of the world.  It is number 7 on the murder list.</p>
<p>This idiot and his rockabilly hippy dreams aside, all I can say is: get out.</p>
<p>While you still can.</p>
<p>To a country where white demographics are a little closer to majority across a wider part of the nation instead of enclaves apt to be overrun.  Enclave is just fancy speech for target rich environment.</p>
<p>When there is nothing to be legally &#8216;reapportioned&rsquo; as there is in ex-Rhodesia, when nobody is productive enough to be &#8216;taxed&rsquo; to fill the robbed state coffers, they will come for you.</p>
<p>And at 16:1 odds, it will not be pretty.</p>

		<p>No doubt of it, the Afrikaaners are the polecats of the world.  They brought civilization to a largely uninhabited part of the Dark Continent, introduced millions of black Africans to modern medicine, western technology, a vastly higher standard of living, and all the advances of western civilizaton.  That they inevitably were the dominant race is hardly their fault.  It&rsquo;s simply the natural order of things, and the arrangement was of enormous benefit to the black Africans, who swarmed to the newly formed nation to avail themselves of modern European civilization.  They weren&rsquo;t enticed there through deceit or trickery, not brought in chains; they came willingly.  And now, of course, they want to confiscate and seize what white intellect, inventiveness, and industry created.  What they don&rsquo;t understand is that within a generation they will have totally destroyed everything created by whites and returned themselves to a stone-age existence, just as they have done in every place on earth in which they&rsquo;ve gained political control.  That&rsquo;s every place, some some places, but every single place in which they&rsquo;ve reached critical mass. </p>

Over THREE THOUSAND dead white farmers slaughtered in their beds&hellip; and in their living rooms&hellip; and in their bathrooms&hellip; by berserk Bantu marauders since the self-righteous West backed ZA into a corner and banished Big Bad Apartheid   &mdash;   yet CNN instead chooses to seek out and report on some naive Afrikaner punk rockers who apparently turn their rainbow delusions into 4/4-time variations on the tired concept of &#8220;Can&rsquo;t we all get along?&#8221; </p>
<p>The REAL story in 21st C. ZA is the low-level Genocide   &mdash;   yes, I used the word Genocide because Genocide is what it is   &mdash;   against (so far mostly rural) white people. Everything else   &mdash;   from the sanitized broadcasts of the World Cup to these three-chord racial masochists   &mdash;   is no more than a distraction. A deadly distraction, but a distraction just the same. </p>
<p>In the journalism biz, this type of &#8220;not seeing the forest for the trees&#8221; is known as &#8220;burying your lede.&#8221; It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;ll get you a failing grade in J-school. </p>
<p>As for &#8220;Afrikaner punk outfit F****polisiekar&#8221; they will, in time, get everything they currently ask for. Indeed, they will get everything they <i>deserve</i>. Because from my extensive experience with punk rock   &mdash;   reaching back over three decades   &mdash;   I can assure you of this: black people everywhere in the world absolutely HATE the sound of Punk Rock. If there&rsquo;s one kind of music that blacks universally can&rsquo;t stand, it&rsquo;s Punk. Punk sounds to them the way Gangsta Rap sounds to you. </p>

		<p>As an Afrikaner myself as well as a resident of South Africa, I must admit that I find the article&rsquo;s choice of a spokesman for us Afrikaners, Francois van Coke, to be rather bizarre. Van Coke is nothing more than a rebellious adolescent who makes amateurish and outdated music. He&rsquo;s simply son of a Dutch Reformed Church minister rebelling against his roots. This is like interviewing Britney Spears and presenting her as somebody representative of Southern Americans.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, in spite of all the hype, Afrikaners as a group are actually monumentally disinterested in the Soccer World Cup. Most of the subscribers to DSTV, a local pay-TV channel, are Afrikaners. Less than a third of DSTV&rsquo;s million or so Afrikaner subscribers actually even bothered to watch the opening ceremony, the most hyped event in the country&rsquo;s history. The limited number of Afrikaner viewers of the SWC opening were however dwarfed by those watching the Super 14 rugby final in May, a sport enjoyed by a majority of white Afrikaners like me, in spite of the coloured quota players that teams are forced to include. Perhaps the lack of interest in soccer has something to do with the fact that, in spite of rugby teams being forced to include quota passengers, the &#8220;national&#8221; (sic) soccer team did not field ONE white player throughout the tournament.</p>

		<p>It just occurred to me that for mass exterminations of South Africa&rsquo;s urban whites to occur, the countryside must first be made &#8220;secure&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s such a push to eliminate the white farmers.</p>
<p>Once there are no longer white-controlled strongholds in the countryside, or reachable safe areas, the white populations of the cities will be effectively &#8216;ghettoized&rsquo;.  Anyone who has studied The Shoah knows what comes next.</p>

		<p>Its rather sad that people on this forum expected widespread violence in South Africa during the world cup. Its even sadder that when such violence did not eventuate, they choose to highlight how little SA has changed because of the cup. If there&rsquo;s one thing amreners could learn from this event, it is the fact that we shouldn&rsquo;t always let our prejudices get the better of us and expect the best from people.</p>

<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m rather confident that wide spread crime, murders, rapes and common robberies have in fact happened in SA..it is just that the media, as usual, don&rsquo;t aedvertise it since the perpetrators are in all liklihood BLACK! and their prey is WHITE! My WHITE South African co-workers tell a different story of what is going on in SA than the MSM is doing.</p>

<p>If you are still trusting the MSM to bring you factual reporting on the crime involved in &amp; around the SWC, then there&rsquo;s no hope for you.</p>
<p>Do you really believe that the inhabitants of the rape capital of the world, for the sake of a childs game, put aside their genocidal tendencies and all of a sudden transformed into happy, white-loving angels?</p>

<p>I have trawled through the net for murders and rapes of tourists but all I could find were reportsd of several robberies. Perhaps it would be helpful if someone could provide a site that reports attacks on tourists.</p>

		<p>I had a great World Cup experience in South Africa in support of the US team. The Ghanaians who eventually eliminated us from the tournament were particularly friendly towards Americans. People in this forum seem to think that Western tourists were murdered and raped; whereas no such reports surfaced among US and European fans in the three weeks I was there. Did I miss something?</p>

		<p>As for the &#8216;punk rock&rsquo; thing, I&rsquo;ve never met a &#8216;punk&rsquo; that isn&rsquo;t anything but a limp-wristed trendy left-winger that&rsquo;s either trying to act tough by being a nuisance, or just a plain nuisance that doesn&rsquo;t have the brains to have a bath or wear clothes without holes in them. And agrees with everything that Jello Biafra says&hellip;everything.<br>
Also, as poster number 5 (Anton) pointed out about above Afrikaaner punk-hero, they&rsquo;re just about always &#8216;rebelling&rsquo; against their nice life that their hard-working parents provided for them.</p>
