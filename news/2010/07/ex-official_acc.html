	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>J. Christian Adams [an ex-Justice official who quit over the handling of a voter intimidation case against the New Black Panther Party], testifying Tuesday before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, said that &#8220;over and over and over again,&#8221; the department showed &#8220;hostility&#8221; toward those cases. He described the Black Panther case as one example of that  &mdash;  he defended the legitimacy of the suit and said his &#8220;blood boiled&#8221; when he heard a Justice official claim the case wasn&rsquo;t solid.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We abetted wrongdoing and abandoned law-abiding citizens,&#8221; he later testified.</p>
<p>The department abandoned the New Black Panther case last year. It stemmed from an incident on Election Day in 2008 in Philadelphia, where members of the party were videotaped in front of a polling place, dressed in military-style uniforms and allegedly hurling racial slurs while one brandished a night stick.</p>
<p>{snip} The Obama administration initially pursued the case, winning a default judgment in federal court in April 2009 when the Black Panther members did not appear in court. But then the administration moved to dismiss the charges the following month after getting one of the New Black Panther members to agree to not carry a &#8220;deadly weapon&#8221; near a polling place until 2012.</p>
<p>The Civil Rights Commission, which subpoenaed Adams, has been probing the incident since last year. Adams said he ignored department directives not to testify and eventually quit after he heard Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez testify that there were concerns the Black Panther case was not supported by the facts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But he [Adams] described the department&rsquo;s hostility toward that and other cases involving black defendants as &#8220;pervasive.&#8221; Adams cited hostility in the department toward a 2007 voting rights case against a black official in Mississippi who was accused of trying to intimidate voters. Adams said that when the Black Panther case came up, he heard officials in the department say it was &#8220;no big deal&#8221; and &#8220;media-generated&#8221; and point to &#8220;Fox News&#8221; as the source.</p>
<p>But as the investigation unfolded, he said he discovered &#8220;indications&#8221; that the Black Panther Party was doing the &#8220;same thing&#8221; to supporters of former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during the Democratic primary season in early 2008. He urged the commission to pursue testimony from other Justice officials to corroborate his story.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams [J. Christian Adams] will make some explosive charges. He says the administration used a racial double standard in deciding last year to drop the prosecution of the New Black Panther Party after members were videotaped in front of a Philadelphia polling place on Election Day 2008 dressed in military-style uniforms, brandishing a billy club and using racial slurs against voters. Mr. Adams says the career prosecutors who pursued the case did their job but were stymied by Obama political appointees, for whom he has harsh words: &#8220;To abandon law-abiding citizens and abet wrongdoers constitutes corruption,&#8221; he told Fox News last week.</p>
<p>President Obama&rsquo;s Justice Department continues to stonewall inquiries about why it dropped the voter intimidation case, which Bartle Bull, a former civil rights lawyer and former publisher of the left-wing Village Voice, calls &#8220;the most blatant form of voter intimidation I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&#8221; Mr. Bull and others witnessed one Black Panther pointing his billy club at voters and making racial threats. Mr. Bull says he heard one yell: &#8220;You are about to be ruled by the black man, cracker!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Justice Department moved to dismiss most of the charges a month after winning a default judgment against the Black Panthers when the party failed to appear in federal court. {snip}</p>
<p>But the Washington Times has reported that six career lawyers at Justice, including Christopher Coates, former chief of the Justice Department&rsquo;s voting section, also favored pursuing the case. One of the career attorneys, Appellate Chief Diana Flynn, had urged in an internal memo that a judgment be pressed against the defendants to &#8220;prevent the paramilitary style intimidation of voters&#8221; in the future.</p>

We know the code.</p>
<p>Civil Rights enforcement means &#8220;make Whites as miserable as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Same definition for &#8220;social justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Racially profiling Whites for misery through DOJ selective prosecution and avoidance of responsibility is how social justice via civil rights is now being accomplished.</p>
<p><br>
We are only witnessing the current tactic in the long march of progress against we Whites who still make the mistake of believing that we deserve life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p>To those who worship lying Rosa Parks &amp; Michael King Rev., voted for Obama, and believe the right things about &#8220;race is just a social construct&#8221;, the proposition of White&rsquo;s wanting to be happy is offensive, toxic, virulent and hateful. </p>
<p><br>
Just as making White Babies is a hate crime against humanity, any White who still enjoys any aspect of being a White American Citizen  must be dealt with as a hate crime and must be forced into misery through degradation, dispossession, Section 8 neighbors, Diversity, and all other horrors of the multicult.<br>

		<p>To believe that a black man could be better than a white man is pure insanity and delusional.  These delusional people need to go to a third world country and get educated.  Obama would better serve his people by going to Africa instead of playing president in a nation founded by white brain power.  What is to gain by letting blacks gain the upper hand in this country?  What is to gain by letting a Maxine Waters and similar others be sitting in Congress?  This country is presently completely lost in purpose and direction as represented by electing a shadowy black man to be its president.  </p>

		<p>This incident went pretty much unchallenged at the time it occurred, but if the precinct was not in a white weinie section of town and in a rural area or an area where there were a lot of conservatives there could very well have been blood shed.  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s literally millions of white warriors in this country who would have stuffed that baton where the sun doesn&rsquo;t shine in these skinny dopes the first time they heard them bragging that the black man is going to rule over these white crackers.</p>
<p>Condoning black militant behavior by fellow racist blacks in the Dept. of Justice is going to lead to out and out conflict between whites and blacks.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m glad it happened.  This black dope as president and his AG are more than any of us could have hoped for.  They&rsquo;re showing whites with at least half a brain that blacks are the most racist dregs in this country today.</p>
<p>There will be more of the same and I&rsquo;ll be cheering.  Things will really heat up the further down the economy spirals.</p>

		<p>They reported this on Fox and Friends this morning. After the video of the former prosecutor stating that the policy was not to prosecute a case invoving a Black offender and a White victim, Gretchen Carlson, Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade looked at each other and one of them uttered &#8221; Wow&#8221; or &#8221; OH My&#8221; or some other insipid response. That was the perfect time  for one of them to have the courage to make a statement and they let us down.</p>
<p>Our gangsta&rsquo; government has declared war on Whites just as the  NSDAP declared war on Jews and  we&rsquo;ll go quietly when they come for us. Like characters in a Kafka novel we&rsquo;ll be so consumed with imaginary guilt that we won&rsquo;t have the will to defend oursleves.</p>

<p><br>
Well, he wasn&rsquo;t wrong: us crackers ARE being ruled by the black man now&hellip; and will be for at least another two-and-a-half years. </p>
<p>But if us crackers as smart as we think we are, we won&rsquo;t make that mistake again. </p>

<p>Amazingly, Rush Limbaugh played that audio TWICE.  There are a million people who listen at any one time, 20 million for any length of time during an entire week.  Hopefully, at least 1.5 million people heard that audio at least once. and of those, most of those have not yet heard it.</p>
<p>If I might be so audaciously hopeful, I think Rush playing that audio just today and just twice, by itself, flipped 10 House seats.</p>

		<p>Glenn Beck is on TV now making a show out of the NBP yelling to kill crackers and cracker babies.</p>
<p>Then just when you think Glenn as made the transition and joined us, he starts talking nonsense about MLK&rsquo;s &#8220;content of character&#8221; and how skin color doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I pray for Glenn.  Surely, he must be suffering from all the attacks on him by blacks and the media.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just one short step from joining us, but he keeps tripping up on the MLK lie.</p>
<p>And since Glenn is  a smart Germanic, he will one day fully admit what he knows in his heart-  SKIN COLOR DOES MATTER.</p>
<p><br>
He will Transcend Diversity, he will Embrace White Humanity, and he will speak out on our behalf by shouting that &#8220;Now we know- it&rsquo;s okay to love your race!&#8221;<br>

		<p>RE Redeemed by racism&hellip;.,on Glenn Beck: I really like the guy, but you are dead on about his obsession with the MLK lie. Beck is very good at exposing communist ties within the Obama administration, but for some reason, he seems oblivious to King&rsquo;s documented communist affiliations. Some day soon, he will come around. When that happens, you&rsquo;d better get a shortwave receiver if you want to hear his broadcasts. </p>

		<p>Some people say we need a conservative black now.  Now, we don&rsquo;t need anymore non-whites OUR COUNTRY.  For the past 50 years we&rsquo;ve wasted a tremendous amount of resources catering to blacks, making sure they&rsquo;re not offended, and even elected a black person to power.  How&rsquo;s that working out for us?</p>

		<p>The double standards going on are unbelievable. If K members stood armed in front of a voting site they would be given maximum sentences and the mainstream media would be screaming about voter intimidation. The US government has broken the K into various splinter groups thanks to lawsuits by the SPLC and Mr Dees. Where are they now? Why are the black panthers not being persecuted out of existence? Seems like we need a resurgence of White advocacy groups more than ever,but we are the ones really being repressed!</p>
