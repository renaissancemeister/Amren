<h1><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5343183">Civil Rights Game Headed to Atlanta</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>ESPN, June 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Atlanta Braves will host Major League Baseball&rsquo;s Civil Rights Games in 2011-12, team president John Schuerholz announced Wednesday at the King Center.</p>
<p>No dates or opponents have been set for the games, which will be played during the next two regular seasons. The 2009-10 games were held in Cincinnati.</p>
<p>Jimmie Lee Solomon, MLB&rsquo;s executive vice president for baseball development, called Atlanta, the home of slain civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., an easy choice as the host city.</p>
<p>Though it has yet to announce an agenda for the Atlanta event, MLB hopes to create greater presence for baseball in the black community. MLB released a report last month stating that black players accounted for just 9 percent of major league rosters in 2009.</p>
<p>Latino players accounted for 27 percent and Asian players 2.3 percent.</p>

		<p>In these stats, &#8220;black&#8221; merely means African-American.  Most of the &#8220;Latinos&#8221; are either very black or partially black in terms of racial heritage.</p>
<p>As an aside, and I think I&rsquo;ve mentioned this recently here:  If Jackie Robinson&rsquo;s first game in the major leagues was such a watershed event for civil rights, then why didn&rsquo;t the New York and National news media understand that when it actually happened?  A few days before the 60th anniversary of Robinson&rsquo;s first game in the MLB, Yahoo Sports republished some major newspapers stories about the game from either the late afternoon press rolls or the next morning.  In most of them, the part about Robinson being the first black player was way down in the paragraph count (where most people wouldn&rsquo;t have read down that far), and mentioned only as an afterthought.  The <i>New York Post</i> referred to him as a &#8220;colored boy.&#8221;  Just a wee lad of 28, for sure.</p>

		<p>Atlanta is perverted and disgusting.  Go into bookstores that sell Gone With the Wind and see all the pictures of Margaret Mitchell with pictures of blacks.  They want you to think she was a Civil Rights worker.  </p>
<p>She got the story about the blacks just right in Gone With the  Wind.  Atlanta is desperate to downplay the truth by surrounding her with blacks.   Read her chapters on Reconstruction and what Rhett Butler did when a black insulted a White woman.  He did the right thing, of course, and was proud of it.</p>
<p>White Atlantans are so desperate to never offend the ruling majority blacks that they would apologize for Jesus&rsquo; being White if they needed to.</p>
<p>Read what she wrote in GWTW about &#8220;swarms of blacks,&#8221; which is all I saw when I was in Atlanta.  <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been to Atlanta and was struck by the contrast between the two types of blacks.  Mostly, I saw full blooded and very African looking blacks, many dirty and unruly.  I also saw the professional looking blacks- the men shaved their heads and wore coats and ties, and the women straightened their hair to resemble White women&rsquo;s hair, all as a trick to hide from us  their truly threatening natures.  </p>
<p>Both groups were as uppity as the worst Reconstruction I freedmen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather deal with the feral blacks in New Orleans than the thugs, politicians, and mulattoes in Atlanta.  Why do White people even live there?  Do they enjoy paying huge property taxes so they can waste their money on Atlanta&rsquo;s black public schools?</p>
<p>White people are frighteningly stoic regarding the conflict between the interests of their White Humanity and the blacks.</p>
<p>TRANSCEND THEIR MULTICULTURAL DIVERSITY &amp; EMBRACE YOUR WHITE HUMANITY.  SERVE AND SATISFY WHITES ONLY.  LET THE DIVERSITY SOLVE ITS OWN PROBLEMS.</p>

		<p>I have travelled to Atlanta extensively and it is pretty much a Detroit now. The whites that can deal with the commute live in the suburbs.  There are alot of whites moving back into the city, but they are the liberals, lots of gays and Obama supporters.  The nice parts of the city are the Jewish parts, who have had a hold on the city for a long time now.  But they are getting ghettoed up too (just look up the women of the Real Housewives show and you will see the best parts of Atlanta are full of blacks acting like blacks with money.) You will see &#8220;swarms of blacks&#8221; there, as it is majority black.  </p>

		<p>Stories like this remind me why I don&rsquo;t watch sports, unless its a White golfer defeating non whites on the golf course.</p>
<p>I join the New Pledge of Our White Humanity:</p>
<p>DEFY DIVERSITY- WHITES ONLY!</p>
<p>I pledge to seek out friends, neighborhoods, churches, schools, governments, institutions and preservation groups who refuse to admit non whites.  </p>
<p>Rarely, I see a contemporary photograph of 100% Whites with no ugly diversity thrown in for &#8220;inclusive sensitivity&#8221;.  These artificats of the Garden of Eden are cherished and held dear as a prayer for our people from the past love of our people.<br>

		<p>Comment number 2 has it just right. The famous scene where the good black saves Charlotte from the white marauders is exactly reversed in the movie. David Duke bring this to light in his book My Awakening. </p>
<p>What we are failing to do in this country is recognize the fact that blacks are dangerous to whites when they have superior numbers or a political or marshall advantage. Black&rsquo;s instincts predominate over any cognitive ability to manage their impulses. </p>
<p>Look at Hati, look at Zimbabwe, look at New Orleans after Katrina, look at Memphis, look at LA after Rodney King, look at Detriot. They cannot create a functioning government or infastructure anywhere they are left to their own devices. </p>
<p>They hate whites because we carry the banners of progress, law, Christianity and science.</p>

		<p>Jimmie Lee Solomon says Jackie Robinson integrated baseball.</p>
<p>Wrong! He was the first black to play major league baseball, in the modern<br>
 (1900-present) era, but by no means was he the first non-Caucasian minority to do so.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, there were several North American aborigine (AKA &#8216;Indians&#8221;) ballplayers. Most notable among these was Louis Sockalexis. In the early 1900&rsquo;s, Chief Bender played for the Philadelphia A&rsquo;s, and Chief Myers was a catcher for the Giants. In those days, all aborigine ballplayers were nicknamed &#8220;Chief&#8221;. Connie Mack, however, always called Bender by his given name, Albert. In Lawrence Ritter&rsquo;s book, &#8220;The Glory of Their Times&#8221;, Myers recalled the pride he felt in going up against Bender and the A&rsquo;s in the 1905 World Series.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s pitcher Adolfo Luque, whom I believe is the first Hispanic to play major league baseball. He was a native of Cuba, with Caucasian, not black or mulatto features. He started out in the early 1920&rsquo;s, and spent most of his career with the Cincinnati Reds.</p>
<p>With black participation at some 9% of MLB, I think the &#8220;Civil Rights Game&#8221; is a desperate attempt by baseball to keep the ghost of Jackie Robinson alive. They&rsquo;ve already mandated that his uniform number be retired universally and permanently, an honor accorded no other player, even Babe Ruth. Ruth did more to save baseball&rsquo;s bacon in the aftermath of the Black Sox scandal of 1919, than anyone else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before, but it bears repeating - baseball&rsquo;s love affair with Jackie Robinson&rsquo;s corpse and memory borders on necrophilia. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Michael Jackson&rsquo;s love affair with little boys.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Another opportunity to promote integration&#8221;</p>
<p>I appreciate very much the balanced nature of the AmRen caption to the article, however, the late Sam Francis once claimed, &#8220;When aggression meets submission the result is annihilation&#8221;. This is not about integration. Considering the wholehearted corporate and community support for &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;, and nearly every citizen bending over backwards in deference towards the black agenda, whatever it&rsquo;s latest incarnation might be and no matter how &#8216;anti-white&rsquo;; it&rsquo;s not about promoting integration at all, but about turning a blind eye to and even celebrating annihilation, or &#8216;disintegration&rsquo;. Thats not so much different from incineration.  </p>

		<p>Baseball needs a Snivel Rights game like a fish needs a bicycle. I remember my dad taking me to baseball games when I was a little girl. Pleasant memories of enjoying the game, eating hot dogs, reaching up to catch a foul ball&hellip;The politics of multiculturalism was the last thing on my mind at that time, and I&rsquo;m sure it was the same for my dad. Just a white father and daughter bonding and having a good time.</p>
<p>Regular people don&rsquo;t want diversity and political correctness rammed down their throats at every turn. We suffer through it at work, on the news, at the movies, and on the billboards we drive by on the freeway. We don&rsquo;t need or want self-righteous leftist lectures on race at the ball game, or anywhere else.</p>
<p>Whenever and wherever good white people are enjoying themselves, multiculturalists will come to try to destroy our happiness. They&rsquo;re attracted to it like a shark to blood. </p>

		<p>Note the date of the game: 2011-2012, which are the first two years of the 150th anniversary of the South&rsquo;s heroic struggle against domination by the North.  </p>
<p>From 2011-2015, anytime you see something about Civil Rights, it will always be put as a context covering how we are supposed to remember the Southern Confederacy.</p>
<p>The message will be: &#8220;Thankfully, the Civil Rights Movement brought an end to the South&rsquo;s official racism, and while we remember the Civil War, we must remember it in context of the heroic stuggle for human dignity and Civil Rights fought by our renowned, esteemed, trailblazing, iconic Civil Rights leaders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody will be able to remember the Civil War without Civil Rights being imposed from the top down upon the ceremonies.</p>
<p>Civil Rights cured the nation of the errors of the South&rsquo;s illegal rebellion, etc.</p>
<p>Confederate monuments will either be taken down or surrounded by taller oneso of lying Rosa Parks and commie Michael King, Rev.</p>
<p>America is becoming uglier by the day, much to the discredit of the Yankees who forced the South with bloodshed back into the &#8220;Union of liberty and brotherly love.&#8221;</p>

		<p> Diversity is another word for getting rid of white people. Why is the NBA, almost 80% black, considered a model of diversity(good), while MLB with about 25% blacks, is considered deficiently diverse, when blacks are only 12.8% of the nation&rsquo;s population? The NBA would seem much less diverse than MLB if &#8220;diversity&#8221; really meant diverse, rather than getting rid of white people. MLB has a RBI(return baseball to the inner city) program,-why doesn&rsquo;t the NBA have a RBS(return basketball to the suburbs) program, if diversity as defined by the dictionary is really the goal? Easy-&#8220;Diversity&#8221;, as used by today&rsquo;s liberals, means getting rid of white people! How can any white person that is not mentally ill support&#8221;diversity&#8221;?</p>

		<p>I last was in Atlanta nearly 20 years ago.  It looked fine then, but maybe that was just downtown and Buckhead.  Have things deteriorated that badly since?  </p>
