			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Kane, Ben Pershing and William Branigin, Washington Post, July 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The House ethics committee formally unveiled charges Thursday against Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.) after efforts to reach a settlement apparently fell short, setting in motion a potentially historic trial of the 20-term congressman.</p>
<p>In a preliminary hearing on the case, a subcommittee disclosed 13 charges that lawmakers described as &#8220;very serious&#8221; violations of House rules and federal law. Rangel did not appear at the hearing  &mdash;  his presence was not required  &mdash;  but he submitted a written statement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an opening statement as the hearing began Thursday afternoon, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.) noted that there had been talk of negotiations on a settlement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Rangel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was given opportunities to negotiate a settlement under the investigation phase,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are now in the trial phase.&#8221; He said Rangel faces &#8220;13 very serious allegations&#8221; relating to his conduct.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a 32-page rebuttal, Rangel&rsquo;s legal team denied the allegations, asserting that he never misused his office.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The hearing&rsquo;s start was delayed an hour by votes on the House floor, during which Rangel huddled on the Democratic side with members of the New York delegation and a few other close supporters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With his 40-year congressional legacy hanging in the balance, lawyers for the former chairman of the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee negotiated with the nonpartisan attorneys for the committee until late Wednesday and continued the discussions Thursday morning, hoping to reach a settlement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 13 counts included those allegations, plus charges that Rangel violated the code of providing faithful government services, House rules on soliciting donations and franking rules. He was also accused of multiple violations of a ban on receiving gifts.</p>
<p>Specifically, the investigative subcommittee found that Rangel broke multiple House rules in his efforts to create and fund the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at the City College of New York, including provisions governing gifts to members and use of official resources for unofficial activities. The probe showed that Rangel frequently solicited donations from lobbyists and companies with interests before his Ways and Means Committee.</p>
<p>The ethics panel reported that Rangel asked his congressional staff to produce &#8220;a list of potential donors to the Rangel Center. The work was done on property of the House of Representatives, on official House time and with the use of official House resources.&#8221; Rangel also sent letters on congressional letterhead to potential donors, along with a brochure requesting a gift of $30 million, or $6 million per year for five years.</p>
<p>The report also outlines Rangel&rsquo;s dealings with Eugene Isenberg, the chief executive of Nabors Industries. Isenberg and his company pledged a combined $1 million to the Rangel Center, the subcommittee said, and in subsequent meetings Isenberg and Rangel discussed &#8220;the retroactivity of tax provisions related to inverted companies&#8221;  &mdash;  a change in tax laws that would benefit Nabors.</p>
<p>In April 2008, Rangel met with officials from insurance giant AIG in hopes of soliciting a $10 million donation to create &#8220;AIG Hall&#8221; at the Rangel Center. AIG officials expressed misgivings about the publicity that might accompany such a donation, according to the report.</p>
<p>The subcommittee found that Rangel&rsquo;s personal financial disclosure forms &#8220;contained numerous errors and omissions&#8221; over the course of several years, including understating or failing to disclose rental income and unearned income.</p>
<p>Rangel owned a brownstone on West 132nd Street in Manhattan from which he failed to disclose rental income for several years before selling it in 2004, the panel said. It said Rangel also failed to report rental income over several years from a villa he owned in Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. He omitted mention of &#8220;vacant lots&#8221; he owned in New Jersey, and he did not report several transactions in his retirement accounts, according to the report.</p>
<p>Taken together, the omissions and errors represented multiple violations of the Ethics in Government Act, which requires members to give a &#8220;full and complete picture&#8221; of their finances each year, the subcommittee alleged.</p>
<p>The investigators reported that Rangel signed a lease for a rent-stabilized apartment in 1996  &mdash;  he already had three apartments in the same Harlem building, which he used as living quarters  &mdash;  by saying that his son, Steven Rangel, would live there.</p>
<p>But Steven Rangel never moved in, and the elder Rangel instead used the fourth apartment as an office for his reelection campaign and political action committee, in violation of the terms of the lease, according to the report.</p>
<p>The subcommittee noted that when building managers sued some tenants for improperly subletting their apartments, Rangel was put on a &#8220;special handling list&#8221; as a member of Congress, and no action was taken against him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thursday&rsquo;s hearing effectively served as an arraignment, in which the prosecution  &mdash;  a four-member team that was the investigative subcommittee  &mdash;  presented the charges against Rangel and publicly released a full report outlining the case. If necessary, a full trial would be held in mid-September, after Congress returns from a nearly seven-week recess.</p>
<p>During Wednesday evening votes, Rangel brushed past reporters, declining to address the status of talks with his legal team. He told reporters that if he had reason to meet with them, he would. Late Wednesday, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D-Ariz.), a politically vulnerable freshman, told Politico she would call for Rangel&rsquo;s resignation &#8220;if the serious charges against him are accurate.&#8221;</p>
<p>She joined Rep. Walt Minnick (D-Idaho) in making that qualified call for resignation, with Rep. Betty Sutton (D-Ohio) the only Democrat to fully call for Rangel to step down ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s hearing.</p>

		<p>When do we get to hear the charges of racism?  Why is MSM waiting for Olbermann to give the cue? Can&rsquo;t they play the race card without his permission?</p>
<p>What we want to see next is the NAACP come out demanding the trial be called off and the GOP apologize by giving Rev. James Cone the congressional medal of honor.</p>

		<p>The great thing about Rangel is he is so high profile. Probably the most powerful black in the US (even more powerful than Obama)&hellip;.taking him down, will do A LOT towards permanently dis-empowering blacks and stopping the flow of funds from the pockets of whites into the crack houses, prostitutes, other criminal activities of non-whites&hellip;..and that is exactly what it is.  Non-whites don&rsquo;t get rich off of whites so much as they build criminal empires off of us.</p>
<p>A Rangel conviction will go a long way toward making whites understand this.</p>

		<p>The committee will probably just assess a fine against Rangel, which he likely won&rsquo;t pay any more than he did the other funds he owes.  Fortunately, the whole spectacle will demonstrate just how poorly a typical black politician operates.</p>

<p>That is what just enrages me to the vomiting point!</p>
<p>Why should there even have been &ldquo;negotiations on a settlement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What makes the US House Criminal Extraordinaire, Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.) so special, or any of his cohorts, regardless of race or party?</p>
<p>He is charged with offenses that indicate at a minimum removal from the US House of Representatives. This must be followed up by trials in the courts, for his criminal activity (if removed) and severe punishment if found guilty in those same courts.</p>
<p>What have we come to here,</p>

		<p>OK, Rep. Rangel was apparently involved in some shady financial practices.  Big deal.  Of the other 544 distinguished members of our congress, I&rsquo;d bet half are at least as crooked as Charlie Rangel.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not defending the guy, but I recognize him for what he is - an old-school machine politician from the Bronx.  It is the white politicians from predominantly white districts that vote for affirmative action and open borders that deserve our ire.<br>

		<p>Recently I thought about Rangel, Arlen Specter and (before he died) Robert Byrd and wondered why these three very old men hadn&rsquo;t retired yet. </p>
<p>Why, I wondered, don&rsquo;t they spend what time they have left lounging on a beach in a luxury resort while enjoying their million$? </p>
<p>The answer: because they&rsquo;re addicted to power.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t get your hopes up. Ultimately nothing will happen to Rangel. He&rsquo;ll be in office until he dies. They&rsquo;ll say he did some small thing wrong, but will not punish him since they always excuse themselves while coming down on us with both feet.</p>
<p>Many of his constituents don&rsquo;t care whether he is honest or not. Remember Adam Clayton Powell?</p>

		<p>I think Rangel will be censured by the House. For those of you who think he&rsquo;ll get a pass because he&rsquo;s a black and a Democrat, there is precedent for censure of black congressmen.</p>
<p>Adam Clayton Powell was censured by the House and stripped of his committee assignments in 1967 for misappropriation of funds. </p>
<p>Charles Diggs (MI) was censured in the early 1980&rsquo;s for misappropriation of funds, and later resigned.</p>
<p>With several Democrats already calling for his resignation, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll circle the wagons on this one. Many of those Democrats are in white districts far away from Harlem. They&rsquo;ll have to explain to their constituents why they&rsquo;ll stick up for a crooked black from Harlem. who enriched himself for years. In this recession, that would appear unseemly. </p>

		<p>Depending on the size of some of these companies, one has to wonder how corrupt the system must be that they don&rsquo;t go in with low-signature tape recorders and video to -every- negotiation and then turn over every illegitimate request for &#8216;charity donations&rsquo; IMMEDIATELY to House investigatory bodies or the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>AIG has it&rsquo;s own problems as it stands now, valued anywhere from 12.5 to 50 billion, after a _182 billion_ bailout.  Yet I would think, somewhere in there, is an explanation for just how bad (systemic) this problem of federal bribes and favors purchasing is.</p>
<p>Rangel&rsquo;s actual errors are peanuts a few million at most.  What he&rsquo;s signed off on however could amount to tens of BILLIONS.</p>
<p>Know your battlefield, Know your enemy, Know yourself.  And you need not fear the outcome of a thousand battles&hellip;</p>
