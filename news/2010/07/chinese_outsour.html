			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrick Thibodeau, Computerworld, July 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Chinese IT outsourcing company that has started hiring new U.S. computer science graduates to work in Shanghai requires prospective job candidates to demonstrate an IQ of 125 or above on a test it administers to sort out job applicants.</p>
<p>In doing so, Bleum Inc. is following a hiring practice it applies to college recruits in China. But a new Chinese college graduate must score an IQ of 140 on the company&rsquo;s test.</p>
<p>An IQ test is the first screen for any U.S. or Chinese applicant.</p>
<p>The lower IQ threshold for new U.S. graduates reflects the fact that the pool of U.S. talent available to the company is smaller than the pool of Chinese talent, Bleum said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The company employs about 1,000 and hires about 1% or less of the people who apply for jobs there. &#8220;It is much harder to get into Bleum than it is to Harvard,&#8221; Rongly [Eric Rongley, the CEO] said.</p>
<p>Shanghai-based Bleum has been recruiting new computer engineering graduates in the Atlanta, Chicago and Denver areas. If a student meets the minimum requirement on an IQ test, he then take a skills test, similar to the hiring process Bleum follows in China.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many employers do measure intelligence to cull candidates from pools of applicants, but they typically call the exams aptitude tests, said Dennis Garlick, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, and author of an upcoming book called Intelligence and the Brain.</p>
<p>An IQ of 140 is extremely high, representing about the top 1% of the population, said Garlick. But he said that even though some studies have shown a correlation between IQ and job performance, IQ is a &#8220;crude assessment tool&#8221; when it comes to sorting out job applicants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>IQ is also an indirect measure of job performance; a high IQ doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean a worker will achieve a certain level in job performance, &#8220;because an IQ test measures abstract reasoning in a general context, and on-the-job performance requires abstract reasoning in a specific context,&#8221; said Garlick.</p>
<p>But for a person who does score high on an IQ test, &#8220;you can reasonably say that the person is likely to be able to understand typical abstract concepts as they are applied in business, understand instructions, follow them, and then generalize them in a new situation,&#8221; said Garlick.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rongley believes that higher-IQ IT workers are more productive. &#8220;The point is not that they are typing faster, but they are finding a faster solution to the technical problem,&#8221; said Rongley.</p>
<p>Moreover, unlike many of the larger IT offshore development companies, Bleum is focused on long-term engagements with its clients, not on one-time projects. Over time, it hopes to hire 100 to 500 U.S. workers to help support North American customers.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s technology labor force is largely young; the massive government ramp-up in science and engineering education is a recent development, and the labor force doesn&rsquo;t yet have a broad pool of people with deep experience in technical disciplines. By seeking high-IQ employees, &#8220;we&rsquo;re compensating for the experience gap,&#8221; said Rongley.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The impact of China&rsquo;s larger talent pool may be evident in an international coding contest conducted annually by TopCoder Inc., a Glastonbury, Conn.-based software development service.</p>
<p>Last year, about 4,200 people took part in this coding competition, which includes events such as algorithm-writing contests. Of the 70 finalists, 20 were from China, 10 from Russia and two from the U.S. The top winner was Chinese. The contest is sponsored in part by the National Security Agency.</p>
<p>Bleum has a policy of requiring its employees to speak English, and many of its hires have already been through English-language programs widely taught in the schools. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In China, for a long time now, anyone from eighth grade and above is being taught English,&#8221; said Rongley. {snip}<br>

		<p>Can&rsquo;t we help Jesse and Al organize a boycott of their products for setting the 125 IQ bar too high for blacks?   </p>
<p>This arbitrary and socially constructed bias toward high IQ smacks of systemic and institutional racism.</p>
<p>We are all created equal.  I insist. I refuse to purchase or use any technology that wasn&rsquo;t created by our wonderful, courageous, heroic, iconic, renowned, esteemed blacks. I will atone for the sins of segregation by boycotting all machines that White people invented and would have been invented by the blacks had Whites not been so racist and hateful.</p>

		<p>There is no difference between an IQ of 125 and 140.  That&rsquo;s not what IQ testing was designed to do, and it cannot do that (define or identify the highly intelligent from the simply intelligent).</p>
<p>IQ testing was designed to split people into three categories.  Normal people (the vast majority) who could benefit from education.  Intelligent people who could benefit from higher education (college etc.) and the uneducable.</p>
<p>What it cannot do is tell if someone is doctorate material or not.</p>

		<p>This is one reason the Chinese will be a force to be reckon with soon.  They call it as it is.  If you do not have what is required don&rsquo;t even bother.  Who has the time and energy to deal with unqualified blacks/hispanics.  The Chinese are probably laughing and extremely puzzled why and how the Americans/Westerns are doing themselves in by playing the diversity game.  Really, this diversity delusion is for what purpose other than to feel good about themselves and to gain votes.  This country is falling further and further behind, now aggravated by installing a shadowy affirmative action president along with an incompetent Congress.  </p>

		<p>How dreadful!  The Chinese are clearly setting out to discriminate against American job applicants, particularly those of the darker persuasion.  Only an utter fool (or US government employee) could fail to see through their evil designs.</p>
<p>The US should retaliate by refusing to buy products from any Chinese companies with average employee IQs of over 85.</p>

		<p>American and Western European IT companies want cheap non-white labor which is the reason so few people from these areas made it to the finals of the TopCoder Contest.  Western children are not learning to love programming from parents and friends.  Russia and Eastern European countries show us white people can still achieve at the highest levels.  China has a population of 1.8 to 2 billion (don&rsquo;t believe the Chinese government&rsquo;s &#8220;official&#8221; population numbers since they are based on the last census in 1989) while Russia has a population of 128 million yet had ten finalists and China 20.  A Belarusian won the high school contest this year.</p>

		<p>Apparently the Russians have a qualitative edge, fielding 10 finalists with a population much smaller than that of the USA and way less than that of China. Very impressive, considering the chaos and economic collapse of their country in the last twenty years. Of course, the American showing is rather embarrassing. Also, being forced to seek work with a Chinese company in the field of IT is also rather a blow to national pride. Bill Gates will only hire people from India, it seems. They come here on visas courtesy of Mr Gates and Americans have to move to Shanghai?  </p>

		<p>This is just one of the blessings of the idiotically shortsighted American practice of favoring foreign students over their own in graduate school admissions.  </p>
<p>One would hope that at some point America&rsquo;s university administrators and faculty would wake up to the fact that America&rsquo;s own children require every advantage our society and educational system can provide if they are to compete effectively with the Chinese in the future.  As abundant research has shown, the average Chinese outshines the average American in IQ, and that advantage pays large dividends when properly exploited.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that hope would be forlorn.  Our university administrators and faculty are driven almost exclusively by a twisted form of meritocracy and the egalitarian fantasy when making admission decisions, and never realize that it is more important to educate OUR best students than to sideline them in favor of the world&rsquo;s best students.</p>
<p>Our people and society need to bring our educational system to heel, or our future will be handed over to others. </p>

		<p>The ratio of applicants to jobs is much higher in China than the US - so how to reduce the applicant oool? IQ tests provided a putatively objective criterion.</p>
<p>The most talented people in the US know the most rewarding fields for them are Finance, Marketing, and Law. The Internet blip of the 1990s and early part of this decade was an outlier for engineering compensation. No one is geeting rich just because they know how to write routing or web code - least not any more.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;IQ is a &#8216;crude assessment tool&rsquo; when it comes to sorting out job applicants.&rsquo; said  Dennis Garlick&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The US military doesn&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>According to Steve Sailer:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Armed Forces Qualification Test, which is the central core of the larger ASVAB test, is required of everyone who wants to enlist. It&rsquo;s the equivalent of a highly g-loaded IQ test&hellip; only 1 percent of enlistees get in with scores in the bottom 30 percent on the test (92 IQ or lower)&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The US military doesn&rsquo;t buy into the &#8216;IQ is meaningless&rsquo; myth and believes that IQ is related to performance, especially when dealing with high-tech equipment under  stressful conditions.</p>
<p>The armed forces don&rsquo;t have time to worry about whether IQ is irrelevant or not, considering that one screw up could be a matter of life and death  &mdash;   they want to know who can repair the jet engines, and fast.</p>
<p>Required minimum scores:</p>
<p>Air Force (AFQT) 55 recently changed from 50 <br>
Navy (AFQT) 35 <br>
Marines (AFQT) 31<br>
Army (AFQT) 31</p>

		<p>TopCoder thingy is a red herring. For the type of guy who is likely to do well in it to participate is not economically sensible. But it is a bit more sensible in Eastern Europe or China where the salaries, and hence opportunity cost, is less than in America. Set TopCoder prize to a million bucks and see how well Americans will do.</p>
<p>More to the point, however, lower salaries and other hiring costs in China and Eastern Europe allow for more hiring of young people fresh out of college. This gives these young people work experience and starts them out on the road to professionalism and higher salaries. By contrast, to get hired in America you usually need 5 years of &#8220;proven experience&#8221;. And there is no IQ test or subject matter test or any other sort of test to get around this HR practice which favors the more experienced as well as the more willing to lie (the Indians, that is).</p>

Maybe, but keep in mind that the vast majority of China&rsquo;s kids don&rsquo;t even have access to a computer. It only has 300 million internet users. Also i see no reason to doubt China&rsquo;s population statistics. The one child policy must be accurately enforced, or economic growth would have been negated by continuous poverty and this is not the case.</p>

		<p>I am surprised there are no marches by Al and Jesse, no screams of &#8220;racism&#8221;.. in the IT and other High Tech businesses.  I have been in the hi-tech medical electronics field for over 30 yrs.  One thing that stands out is the total absence of blacks and Hispanics in this field.<br>
Your primary skills are logical thinking, ability to reason and learn. You definitely need a high IQ to do well, perhaps even survive in the High Tech world.  <br>
Another question I have is: What will happen when all the smart people are driven out after this country finally completes its slide into 3rd world status??</p>

		<p>While the US fiddles with unproven, and oft wrong, social theories the Chinese are moving forward with practical solutions.  The bulk of Chinese leadership have engineering training, here in the US law degrees.  One the science of the possible, and for us the art of the possible.  The Chinese are rapidly moving to overwhelm us first with cheap labor, then cheap trained labor, and lastly skilled labor.  And we think we can compete with one hand tied behind our backs.  Ironically we tied that hand ourselves!  </p>

<p>   Hey what happened to all those super genius East Indian IT people? Where are they now when faced with true competition and where you bluffing and lying skills do not help. Maybe TopCoder Inc. have one section for interview lying and one for &#8216;boasting about how they are intellectually superior you are as a race&rsquo; to give the East Indians a chance to win.</p>

<p>Hmmmm &hellip; is it possible that they were somehow disappointed in the 140 IQ pool? I am curious as to the interracial job performance controlling for IQ. i.e., How does a 125 IQ White programmer compare to a 125 (or 140) IQ Asian?</p>

		<p>&#8220;As abundant research has shown, the average Chinese outshines the average American in IQ, and that advantage pays large dividends when properly exploited.&#8221;</p>
<p>The average IQ of Americans is brought down a great deal by large numbers of Third World immigrants and blacks etc&hellip;&hellip;. When looking at white IQs only, there are plenty of highly intelligent whites throughout America and the world who could show their own against the Chinese.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stop talking about China&rsquo;s tremendous IQ advantage, because when comparing them to whites only, the advantage really isn&rsquo;t so tremendous.</p>
<p>Having said that, this is where a lot of China&rsquo;s success comes from:  1)  Incredibly large population   2)  Racial homogeneity   3) National pride     4)  Like India, it has to get people into engineering and science in order to catch up to the West.  Meanwhile, the West doesn&rsquo;t have as much of an incentive for people to go into these fields anymore&hellip;.so instead they go into business and law.</p>
<p>Please think about all the factors involved here.  The Chinese have an average IQ advantage over whites of 5 points, but compared to whites in some countries it is more like 2 or three points.  If white people would get their act together, they could hold their own against China.  At that point, the only thing for us to fear would be their high population numbers over there, as well as their focuses on eugenics and artificially making their way to the top.</p>
<p>Other than that, I think that innovative science is still pretty much a white man&rsquo;s game.  Otherwise, I wonder why China hasn&rsquo;t made it to the moon yet. We showed them how to do it decades ago.</p>

		<p>This may be an unpopular idea but I believe it&rsquo;s more important that the stupid class behave themselves rather than the smart class excels.<br>
It only takes 1 stupid person to become a rapist / mugger / whatever and it will take 4 smart people to produce economic wealth to bring society back into equilibrium.</p>
<p>Of course it would be even better to have it all, but what country on this planet is rich in everything: natural resources, beautiful people, smart people, honest politicians?</p>

<p>If that happens you&rsquo;ll see a worse version of Detroit or Camden or East St. Louis on a national scale.  I say even worse, because without any genuine producers and the economy they drive to over-tax, the federal government will be unable to prop up the country with gratuitous spending, the way it currently props up more localized disasters like the cities I mentioned.  We&rsquo;re seeing this in South Africa, as young, educated Boers emigrate.</p>

		<p>Hmmm. Too many (often on this site even) cite the Bell Curve results of higher Oriental IQ like some kind of Biblical revelation that Asians are more intelligent than Whites. Does any White ever question this? Wouldn&rsquo;t the proof be in the pudding?  After all, East Asians would be centuries behind without the benefit of White technology.</p>
<p>If Asians are so much smarter why would any IT company headquartered in Asia need to resort to hiring Whites for anything?  Wouldn&rsquo;t there be more than enough of those oft- touted super-IQ Asians to be had?</p>
<p>Occasionally a news story such as this one surfaces and casts a pall on those Bell Curve numbers.  I often wonder if the Bell Curve results are deliberately skewed to goad Whites into believing that letting Asians colonize our nations is to our benefit.  To displace us all the faster.  After all, there is no guilt-trip club like slavery to browbeat Whites over the head with as in the case of blacks.  So a method needed to be contrived to con Whites into accepting Oriental aliens into our midst. Hence cooked Bell Curve stats to fool Whites into believing that East Asians are some kind of low-crime super-geniuses. So as per the new religion of diversity we should be happy to cede our countries and gene pool to them.</p>
<p>But now we have Bleum Inc. that tried to run with this ball of superior Oriental IQ and seems to have come up kinda short.  As perhaps has Bill Gates who was supposed to have establised an R &amp; D facility in China.  No news yet on any fantastic advances.<br>
Indeed, regarding the insistence that East Asian IQ is superior to White, we Whites need to ask ourselves ala Dr. Phil, &#8220;How&rsquo;s that workin for ya?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wake up. Concrete results point the other direction. Whites need to consider the agenda behind the Bell Curve.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;The Armed Forces Qualification Test, which is the central core of the larger ASVAB test, is required of everyone who wants to enlist. It&rsquo;s the equivalent of a highly g-loaded IQ test&hellip; only 1 percent of enlistees get in with scores in the bottom 30 percent on the test&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are some jobs that are closed to those with a low IQ (ASVAB) score, or rather, some military occupation specialties that you have to have a high score to qualify for. Foreign language for one, and military intelligence. It&rsquo;s probably about saving money and not part of an elite eugenics type thing.  </p>

&#8220;If these Chinese are as smart as they say, how come they&rsquo;re looking for highly intelligent programmers in Atlanta? Reminds me of Stephen Hawking, a couple of years ago, looking for a black Einstein in Africa. Didn&rsquo;t find him, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well there are plenty of Whites living in the Atlanta area but a better question is why do they need to hire Westerners anyhow over the hundreds of millions of Chinese living there?  Despite all the talk about Asians having high IQs, it&rsquo;s still the West that produces most scientific innovations with the orientals at best copying us.  There is some creative quality in the brains of Europids that orientals do not possess in their genetic makeup.     <br>

		<p>China will crumble right along with us.  Their economy is tied too closely to ours.  It&rsquo;s not all it&rsquo;s cracked up to be.  They didn&rsquo;t exist as an economic power until Nixon went to Mao and started the slow process of sending our manufacturing base there.  </p>
<p>We made China what it is today.  Without the American consumer they&rsquo;d all still be living in abject poverty, not just the ones who live away from the coastal cities like now.</p>
<p>If memory serves me correctly there are 12 fleet aircraft carriers active in our navy.  China has zero.  It took us decades to figure out how to make them work.  They haven&rsquo;t even gotten started.</p>
<p>Sure there are a billion (or more) Chinese in China.  But the point is they&rsquo;re in China.  They don&rsquo;t have a blue-water navy, no strategically-capable air force, no force projection capability of any kind.</p>
<p>And the biggest elephant-in-the-room the China-lovers refuse to acknowledge: they can&rsquo;t build anything without first stealing the technology from a Western nation.  Most of their aircraft designs until recent times were reverse-engineered Soviet knock-offs.  Their biggest skill is corporate espionage.  </p>
<p>I work with a number of Chinese people.  There&rsquo;s no disputing their overall intellectual abilities, but if anything about them stands out to me it&rsquo;s the lack of outside-the-box thinking.  Give them a set of parameters within to work and they&rsquo;ll do exactly what you want them to.  They don&rsquo;t think quickly on their feet though, anything happens that&rsquo;s not on the checklist and they need help.</p>
<p>When the global diversity machine arrayed against the further ascendancy of whites finally collapses as a result of biting too hard the hand that ironically feeds it, and the white man can get the foot of the multiculturalists off of his neck, I suspect there will be an &#8220;equalization&#8221; of sorts.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Why dont companies right here at home set a 130 IQ minimum for hiring? They could virtually eliminate their &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe so, but I&rsquo;m thinking that the non-whites (esp. blacks and latinos) will complain that the I.Q. tests are inherently biased in favor of whites, and will push for more &#8220;cultural sensitivity&#8221; when testing a person&rsquo;s intelligence.  Rather than simply acknowledging that non-whites  don&rsquo;t score as well on tests as whites, they will always look for some flaw in the test itself.<br>

		<p>I have to wonder if this is supposedly the &#8220;Asian Century&#8221; dubbed by the MSM then why do they still heavily rely on Western businesses and technology?  Why are so many so desperately trying to move to the West?  I remember a conversation with an Indian who said his country would one day eclipse the US.  Imagine that.  A country without even basic sanitation eclipsing the US? A place where the average citizen walks through human feces every day while it squishes between the toes of their bare feet?  Get real.  Stop buying Chinese products and find an American alternative.  Chinese goods are notoriously inferior in quality.  What good is a lower sticker price when you&rsquo;ll end up having to replace it in a few months or get poisoned by the contents?    </p>

		<p>&#8220;Please think about all the factors involved here. The Chinese have an average IQ advantage over whites of 5 points, but compared to whites in some countries it is more like 2 or three points. If white people would get their act together, they could hold their own against China. At that point, the only thing for us to fear would be their high population numbers over there, as well as their focuses on eugenics and artificially making their way to the top.&#8221;</p>
<p>You detract from your own argument when you imply that there is &#8220;one IQ test&#8221;. That set by Buj and Vanko (putting Germanic nations at 107) was based on Cattell Culture Fair, on which Hong Kong scored 116.</p>
<p>Raven&rsquo;s Progressive Matrices, which put white English at 100, found 108 in Shanxi (among children of rural villagers who earned at most a combined income of $400 a month and had 7 years of public education), and 116 in rural Zhejiang (population: 49 million)</p>

<p>I never implied there &#8220;was one IQ test&#8221;.  And why are you zeroing in on my post when plenty of other posters always use the same stats (whether they are on my side or &#8220;the Chinese are geniuses&#8221; side)?</p>
<p>The stats I include (which most posters on this site typically include), come from Rushton&rsquo;s work, which is based on a conglomeration of studies done all around the world at different times by different people.  </p>
<p>Based on all these studies, he puts the white AVERAGE at 100 and the East Asian AVERAGE at around 105.  Yet you are trying to get me to believe that the average Chinese IQ is over 110 by showing me bits and pieces of studies that took place in certain parts of China (all of which, Rushton more than likely included in his research to come up with his overall average).</p>
<p>Why are you presenting me with IQs found for overall white countries and comparing them to the communities with the highest IQs in China?  That is hardly fair, and no matter which way you want to spin it, the average East Asian IQ based on countless studies is found to be around 105 while the average white IQ is found to be around 100.<br>

		<p>Rushton found an IQ of 109 in Beijing and if I&rsquo;m not mistaken 112 in Shanghai and then assumed rural Chinese were much less intelligent, ascribing them an (arbitrary) IQ of 103. Then he put these numbers together and got 100 originally, which he then revised upwards to 105.</p>
<p>Those are just two examples of scores that do not fit the &#8220;105&#8221; figure given by Lynn. There are also regions that score lower- such as Western Tibet. In Western Tibet the average score is 95. In Southwest China the average score is 105. These two represent the lowest Raven&rsquo;s Progressive Matrices averages found in China, though many regions have not been tested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you presenting me with IQs found for overall white countries and comparing them to the communities with the highest IQs in China? That is hardly fair&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree it would not be fair- just as it&rsquo;s not fair to compare the Netherlands or Germany to all of China. Shanghai and Beijing have double the population of the Netherlands, and China&rsquo;s (and indeed East Asia&rsquo;s) arguably most intelligent province contains 94 million people.</p>

		<p>Re 27<br>
First,regardless of naval strengths, the Chinese have the gigantic advantage of being where they are; we are sending our carriers to them, not they to us. The island of Taiwan is hostage to their power, we know it and they know we know it.It is not moving either. The Chinese own so much of our debt that our government is going to be functioning as their tax collector for generations to come. <br>
Second, as Niall Ferguson has stated, empires collapse when debt service becomes so large the military cannot be financed without ruinous default. When you consider the Chinese are very well aware of out financial tipping point (after all they are doing the lending), our military potential and our strategy, it is irrelevant whether or not they choose to invest in aircraft carriers. They aren&rsquo;t doing so because they don&rsquo;t need to; hovercraft can speed to Taiwan pretty quickly. A few tremors released into the financial markets and we will back down. </p>

		<p>There is no doubt that the Chinese on average are exceptionally clever people.  Having competed with them head-to-head in a hard sciences major in graduate school, I found them to possess some formidable schools.</p>
<p>That just made it all the sweeter when I outperformed them.  I can tell you for a fact that they have the implicit assumption that they are superior to all of their American counterparts - the result of growing up in a culture that actually views itself positively, instead of constantly belittling itself like White America.  They don&rsquo;t like encountering Westerners that outperform them. </p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t supermen by any stretch of the imagination, but they do have the super power of enormous population of very capable people and a booming economy.  Those same characteristics made the USA into a superpower.  I think it is highly probable that China will surpass us in almost every field of endeavor - not because they are superior to Whites, but because we have voluntarily embraced the destruction of our nations in the form of diversity and multiculturalism.</p>
<p>When they do surpass us, we&rsquo;ll have nobody to blame but ourselves.   </p>

		<p>Some mental traits will boost the score on an IQ test but also make the testee less capable of doing high grade science and technology development and discovery. If you render down IQ to a simple number you lose a lot of information in the process - its very subtle the closer you look at it. Few people understand that IQ tests actually measure two parameters and not one and that some G boosting traits will give you a lower IQ score by lowering the P parameter. </p>
<p>2nd, looking at average IQ is wrong. Average whites have a low ability for technology or science. Many are utterly uninterested. You only find high grade science and engineer minds in a tiny and rapidly (generation-wise) shrinking minority of whites. It does not matter how many standard worker whites (even if they have a high IQ) remains if this minority becomes so rare that its not longer possible for its members to network. We will be in an idiocracy by then. </p>

		<p>I still can&rsquo;t figure out what the Anonymous poster above is claiming in response to my IQ arguments.  He agrees that both Rushton and Lynn came up with averages of 105, but still insists they are wrong.</p>

<p>Wow&hellip;..they feel they are superior in what ways?  Do they think they were the first to invent all the technology that they currently use?  Are they that ignorant about history?  They have every healthy right to love their own so much, but they are foolish and arrogant if they won&rsquo;t at least give credit where it is due.  </p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is highly probable that China will surpass us in almost every field of endeavor - not because they are superior to Whites, but because we have voluntarily embraced the destruction of our nations in the form of diversity and multiculturalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a pretty strong death sentence for you to be predicting for your own people. Sometimes I think the people on here celebrate the fact that China might get ahead.</p>
<p>As for me, I would like to focus on my own people and see what we need to do to get our acts together.  As I said before, it is not as if whites are that far removed from being on top of the world.  The people on here sometimes act as if the Chinese are flawless people with little problems of their own.</p>
<p>Why do so many of you waste your time being so fascinated with the Chinese?  Our own people need all the attention we can give them.</p>
