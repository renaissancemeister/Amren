<h1>Sarkozy Orders Illegal Roma Immigrants Expelled</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jenny Barchfield and Cecile Roux, Google News, July 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Wednesday ordered authorities to expel Gypsy illegal immigrants and dismantle their camps, amid accusations that his government is acting racist in its treatment of the group known as Roma.</p>
<p>Sarkozy called a government meeting Wednesday after Gypsies clashed with police this month following the shooting death of a youth fleeing officers in the Loire Valley.</p>
<p>Sarkozy said those responsible for the clashes would be &#8220;severely punished&#8221; and ordered the government to expel all illegal Roma immigrants, almost all of whom have come from eastern Europe.</p>
<p>He pushed for a change in France&rsquo;s immigration law to make such expulsion easier &#8220;for reasons of public order.&#8221; He said illegal Gypsy camps &#8220;will be systematically evacuated,&#8221; calling them sources of trafficking, exploitation of children and prostitution.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Community leaders contend the very principle of the meeting  &mdash;  which singled out an ethnic group in a country that is officially blind to ethnic origins  &mdash;  is racist and warn of grave consequences if their side isn&rsquo;t heard. France&rsquo;s government does not count how many of its citizens are of a certain ethnicity; everyone is simply considered French.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>France&rsquo;s relationship with what it calls Gypsies is complex and complicated by divisions among the disparate populations.</p>
<p>One, formally given the administrative label of &#8220;traveling folk,&#8221; includes several hundred thousand French citizens who have lived in France for centuries, and were traditionally nomadic but have become increasingly sedentary in recent years.</p>
<p>The other main Gypsy population is made up of recent immigrants who come mostly from Eastern European countries like Romania and Bulgaria, usually illegally, and are often seen begging on the streets of French cities.</p>
<p>Those in the more established communities say they are being unfairly lumped together with illegal new immigrants. Sarkozy&rsquo;s orders Wednesday targeted Roma, though the violence in Saint-Aignan earlier this month was in a community of traveling folk established in the region for years.</p>

		<p>The cynic in me is very leery of this.  Sarkozy is nothing more than a carpetbagging Julius Caesar.  As such, his motives must always be suspect.</p>
<p>I might also add no one has actually be expelled, yet.</p>
<p>My eyes are on places like Hungary, Austria and Denmark.  I think France is too far gone but I&rsquo;m hoping I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

		<p>The people that he should be expelling are the blacks and muslims. I have seen pictures of these, alleged! Eastern Europeans and they look black in most cases to me, apparently the French, Germans and Brits have a wide interpretation of Roma.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t be too cynical, people. Sarkozy is a pretty great man. He stood up to those rioters, called a spade a spade. What&rsquo;s more, he has a very strong mind, much, much, more &#8220;articulate&#8221; than Obama. He does what he thinks is right and he doesn&rsquo;t give a you know what about what people think. Gypsies are a nuisance from what I hear, why should people put up with that? The guy has common sense, God forbid!  </p>

		<p>Well, at least they&rsquo;re actually calling the cigany &#8220;gypsy&#8221; and &#8220;Roma&#8221; now. <br>
Usually these articles just state &#8220;Eastern Europeans&#8221; and leave most Americans thinking that Europeans are having problems with white Czechs, Poles, Hungarian, Ukranians, etc. <br>
Gypsies in their camps are a problem in Europe the way blacks in public housing ghettoes and Mexicans in barrios are problems in the United States. <br>

		<p>A few months earlier there was documentary on BBC where they have shown how gypsies make money in Italia - <br>
prostitution and robery. And from it, they managed to build whole neighbourhood of superb(huge) houses back <br>
in Romania(the gypsy was a guide himself). There are different gypsies, but the successful ones live in <br>
palaces(real palaces, with freskas on ceiling and various decorations)</p>
<p>I have gypsy camp in about 10km from home. They started living here some time after WW2. Mostly slum <br>
buildings. Their men deal drugs, roberies, women do small roberies, pickpocketing and fortune telling. The <br>
successful ones become singers and dancers. Back in USSR, several autumns they bought opium poppy from my <br>
neighbour. The police even has mobile kiosk near the camp, it provides clean free needles(no joke), costs <br>
~30grands euros per year. Latest development - EU said it will give a few millions so the new housings are<br>
 built for them.</p>

		<p>The Roma have always been a part of European culture. They have been there thousands of years. At worst they can be described as a nuisance. They are not a threat, like the Muslims are.

This won&rsquo;t be easy.   The Marxist Left in France has for a long time elevated Gypsies to the level of a sort of holy minority, marvelous creatures who can do no wrong (that was before the French had blacks to fawn upon).  It is exactly the way American blacks have been idealized by the Left in the USA. Gypsies and blacks are above reproach.</p>
<p>These wondrous creatures are portrayed as sensitive, artistic, wise, clever, full of talent and &#8220;soul&#8221;&hellip; far beyond the limits of ordinary mortals. They are not burdened by silly bourgois considerations such as holding a job, earning a salary, paying a mortgage, respecting the law. They are free as the birds and migrate with the seasons. They are emancipated from western capitalism and Protestant &#8220;work ethics&#8221;.  Let a Gypsy (or black)  merely sing a song, play a guitar, blow a horn, or write a poem, and it&rsquo;s a marvel of creativity   &mdash;   sheerest genius!  All the leftist critics will be (unanimously) swooning with ecstasy over such talent. </p>
<p>And if he writes a complete novel, it&rsquo;s an astounding achievement almost beyond belief. Give him a Nobel prize!&hellip;(as has been done).</p>
<p>One has to ask why the &#8220;critics&#8221;, the &#8220;journalists&#8221; and the &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; who control the forum of public ideas, consistently favor a minority   &mdash;   ANY minority   &mdash;   over the majority French population.   Whatever the reason, and whatever their motives,  this all-but-official national perception,  so deeply ingrained, so long in place among the leftists and ruling intelligentsia (who are <i>very  </i>influential in France), will be hard to get over. One does not re-construct an entire national mentality overnight.</p>
<p>Expelling a sacred minority?  Many good Frenchmen will be aghast. We can be sure that cries of &#8220;fascist!&#8221; and &#8220;racism!&#8221;  will be heard from every direction. Until now, that&rsquo;s usually been the quickest, easiest way to settle any issue and put the opposition to rout.  </p>
<p>But as the eyes of the French open, maybe no longer.</p>

<p>False. </p>
<p>From Wikipedia :<br>
&#8220;In 1322, a Franciscan monk named Symon Semeonis described people resembling these &#8220;atsinganoi&#8221; living in Crete and, in 1350, Ludolphus of Sudheim mentioned a similar people with a unique language whom he called Mandapolos, a word which some theorize was possibly derived from the Greek word mantes (meaning prophet or fortune teller).[49]</p>
<p>Around 1360, an independent Romani fiefdom (called the Feudum Acinganorum) was established in Corfu and became &#8220;a settled community and an important and established part of the economy.&#8221;[50]</p>
<p>By the 14th century, the Romanies had reached the Balkans; by 1424, Germany; and by the 16th century, Scotland and Sweden.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
They entered Europ following the Ottoman invasion, and while they adapted themselves to the surrounding cultures and somewhat superficially converted to christianism, they could in a near future copy the african / arab / muslim behaviours and maybe choose to become muslims if the dominant power become muslim .</p>
<p>Regularly one can heard, in France, that gypsies and north-africans engage in (limited) tribal warfare, as their relatively lower intelligences put them in the same level.</p>
<p>Lately a 22 years old gypsie tried to force is way throught a police checkpoint and got killed in the process. Then about 50 friends or relatives attacked the gendarmerie (police post) in the small village of Saint-Aignan, pillaged a bakery and cut and burned some trees. Wich show how intelligent they are.</p>
<p>The fast and superb reaction of our marvelous politicians : send more gendarmes (policemen) to protect&hellip; the other gendarmes.</p>
<p>Get those stupid vandals in jail would be so crazy&hellip;</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Nonsense!  That statement is totally wrong. The first Gypsies only arrived in Spain (via North Africa) in the 1400s. Then in France, where they were called &#8220;Egyptians&#8221; (hence the name &#8220;Gypsy&#8221;). The first Gypsies to reach Germany arrived  in 1424, via Turkey and the Balkans. They were by no means an ancient &#8220;part of European culture&#8221;, being totally unknown until then.  At first they were seen by Europeans as a novelty, then quickly came to be viewed as pests and parasites. </p>
<p>Through the centuries since, there have been numerous attempts, in various countries, to settle and assimilate them   &mdash;   all in vain. They have always been viewed as outsiders, and have HELD THEMSELVES apart as outsiders, resisting all assimilation.  They have never been any intrinsic &#8220;part of European culture&#8221;. </p>
<p>They generally adopted the externals of the dominant religions of their host countries   &mdash;   while retaining their underlying ancient belief systems which originated in India. According to Wikipedia, <i>&#8220;Romani social behavior is strictly regulated by Hindu purity laws (&#8220;marime&#8221; or &#8220;marhime&#8221;), still respected by most Roma. This regulation affects many aspects of life, and is applied to actions, people and things&hellip; Cremation and burial are both known from the time of the Rigveda, and both are widely practiced in Hinduism today.&#8221; </i></p>
<p><i>Many Romanies for a variety of reasons choose not to register their ethnic identity in official censuses. There are an estimated four million Romani people in Europe and Asia Minor (as of 2002), although some high estimates by Romani organizations give numbers as high as 14 million.</i></p>
<p>Here is an interesting map of the present distribution of Gypsies (in Europe, 2007).    <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ybaugko" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/ybaugko</a></p>
<p>PS. I certainly agree with S. Hoosier that they are not a large-scale &#8220;threat&#8221; in the way that the Moslems are, and that&hellip; &#8220;Sarkozy is just doing this for show, and it won&rsquo;t do a thing to solve the problems facing France.&#8221;  This is just some of Sarko&rsquo;s &#8220;tough guy&#8221; posturing meant to appease the French voters and appear to be doing something. Neither the numbers nor the political power of the Gypsies give him anything to worry about. They make convenient scapegoats. But this is not to deny that they are a very annoying thorn in the side. Since the nazis had tried to do something about them, everything today is seen through that lens.  Hence, nothing is allowed to be done about them, or that would be &#8220;nazi&#8221;.</p>

I have seen the cracks in the wall start to appear on this issue. More and more middle class people are speaking out on &#8220;Saturation Fatigue&#8221; from being bombarded with journalistic accounts of minorities &#8220;Triumphing over adversity.&#8221; I recently saw a post where a woman wailed and pleaded for once to be regaled about the best and brightest, and not the neediest and those striving to reach mere mediocrity. Which the media would then celebrate as a victory&hellip;</p>

<p>Wrong, the Roma&rsquo;s began to arrive during the decline of the Roman Empire.  They have been a nuisance, but more than &#8220;nuisance light.&#8221;  In fact, there was once quite a lot of truth about &#8220;gypsies&#8221; kidnapping babies and little children.  They sold them to North African slavers, or sometimes raised them up to be prostitutes.  They trespass, steal, and evade laws.  There have been attempts to help them so that they won&rsquo;t steal and such, but they continue regardless.  I lived in Eastern Europe and vacations extensively in France during the &rsquo;90s.</p>
<p>Sarkozy  may well be warming up for greater things.<br>

		<p>The gypsies even invaded &#8220;Mayberry&#8221;. There was actually a Gypsy episode of the &#8220;Andy Griffith Show&#8221;. After they ripped off Ant Bea by selling her bad jewelry, Sheriff Taylor ran them out of town. They then pretended to curse Mayberry with a drought in retaliation. One of the gypsies was played by Klinger from MASH. It was funny, and interestingly the Hollywood folks allowed the stereotype. I don&rsquo;t think that would happen anymore</p>

		<p>Before people start praising Sarko, remember that Sarko has called for nation-wide miscegenation to &#8220;unify&#8221; the country. He&rsquo;s probably only moving against Roma illegal aliens because he knows that they will never assimilate, and this action will make it look like he&rsquo;s tough on immigration when he does nothing about the millions of Muslims and blacks colonizing France. </p>

<p>I remember that episode!  The Gypsy family in that episode consisted of two brothers (thieves and con artists), a mother (drunkard and two-bit fortune teller) and a sister (&#8216;loose in the caboose&rsquo;).  No punches were pulled in that episode, either.  No distinction was made between &#8220;good&#8221; Gypsies and bad ones.</p>
<p>As someone who grew up near a clan of Gypsies I can state unequivocally there was more than a grain of truth in that episode.</p>
<p>In a later episode Sheriff Andy Taylor remembered those same Gypsies and didn&rsquo;t hesitate to voice his opinion that Gypsies were all no good.  To the best of my recollection, that show was the last TV series that dealt honestly and candidly with the subject of race realism.  The leftist drivel on TV today is so overtly anti-White and anti-Western I hardly watch TV anymore, and only to watch the news, weather or the occasional science show.</p>

		<p>The Americans and the Brits (to name major white populations) know little about the gypsies but let me tell you, I would rather have blacks in my neighbourhood than Roma gypsies. They are raised to be sociopathic towards their host society by their family, only showing empathy towards their family (although they still may stab each other to death over something stupid) and mere contempt for everyone else.</p>
<p> In countries where it&rsquo;s possible, they go on life long pension once they turn 18 and keep stealing what they can carry and making the life of their potential neighbours more difficult.</p>
<p> Public schools have them pass grades even though many can&rsquo;t even read but they figure it&rsquo;s the easiest way.</p>
<p> They also commit disproportionate amounts of violent crime from which whites are not safe and are smart enough to cry racism when applicable, although their IQ&rsquo;s are in the American black range at best. </p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting tidbit about Scottish economist Adam Smith, author of Wealth of Nations.</p>
<p>Smith&rsquo;s biographer John Rae recorded that Smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of four and released when others went to rescue him:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;At the age of 4 he was kidnapped by a band of Gypsies, though prompt action by his uncle soon effected his rescue. &#8216;He would have made, I fear, a poor Gypsy,&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And #16, Northern European reports this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;their IQ&rsquo;s are in the American black range at best&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Steve Sailer quotes The Guardian as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In the Czech Republic, 75% of Roma children are educated in schools for people with learning difficulties, and 70% are unemployed (compared with a national rate of 9%). In Hungary, 44% of Roma children are in special schools, while 74% of men and 83% of women are unemployed. In Slovakia, Roma children are 28 times as likely to be sent to a special school than non-Roma; Roma unemployment stands at 80%.</p>
<p>The Guardian, of course, blames this solely on discrimination&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Fom the same Steve Sailer article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;One of the first acts of our allies in the Kosovo Liberation Front in 1999 after we bombed Serbia into submission for them was to ethnically cleanse the Gypsies from Kosovo&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>How soon before the refugee industry here begins importing them in massive numbers into the US?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;A Monroe County grand jury is about to hear the story of a Rochester teenager who says her mother sold her for $3,000 to another family that forced her to do household chores and have sex with a 21-year-old man&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>But, of course, we must respect their cultural differences, to do otherwise is racist.</p>
<p>And the Mail reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;British police said last year that they were struggling to cope with a staggering 800 per cent increase in crimes, such as pickpocketing, committed by Romanians (should read Roma) since they started coming to Britain in large numbers&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>In Belfast, local natives have been uprising against the Roma:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;youths  &mdash;  aged from 14 to 20  &mdash;  admitted they had been present during the attacks on Romanian immigrants this week that made headlines around the world.<br>
&lsquo;So what if we were?&rsquo; said one, curling his lip. &lsquo;They had it coming.&rsquo;&hellip;these &lsquo;foreigners should be burned out of their f****** homes. All we hear about are their problems. For once, why don&rsquo;t you write about the problems these people cause to us locals&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He is referring to a wave of petty crime that has swept Belfast over the past two years  &mdash;  the period in which the Roma have arrived. </p>
