<h1>Our &#8220;Free&#8221; Republic</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gregory Hood, Occidental Dissent, July 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A few days ago, the indispensable Jared Taylor was interviewed by the Washington Examiner. The interview was fair and objective. Taylor was described, accurately, as a &#8220;race realist,&#8221; not as a Nazi, or a white supremacist, or a Holocaust denier. It should be pointed out that the interviewer was a black woman.</p>
<p>Of course, the fact that this interview is even unusual tells you something. It also is significant that the only person who felt like they could publish such an interview was a black woman. God knows, Bryon York, or Tim Carney, or any of the other &#8220;conservatives&#8221; who write for the Examiner would run screaming from Jared Taylor.</p>
<p>In any event, this morning, I go on to check a couple internet sites before I start my work for the day. One of the sites is FreeRepublic.com, a huge conservative news forum. There I notice this  &mdash;  
<div class="text-center">
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
 <tr>
 <td align="center" width="625"><img src="/news/2010/07/23/conservatism1.jpg" alt="freerepublic1"></td>
 </tr>
</table>
</div></p>
<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; I think. I should take care to mention I did not post this, nor did I comment on it (I &#8220;lurk&#8221; at Freerepublic but never comment.) So I click on it and read it. There are about nine comments, all of which are either neutral or positive with two exceptions. One, by &#8220;Zionist Conspirator&#8221; asks if Jared Taylor is an &#8220;evolutionist&#8221; (I don&rsquo;t know what he is getting at here.) Another, by someone whose name I didn&rsquo;t catch, wonders if Jared Taylor is advocating segregation and posts, &#8220;Danger, danger Will Robinson!&#8221; Uh oh, non-kosher conservatism detected!</p>
<p>Whatever, I think. I look at some other things, come back. Of course, then I see this  &mdash;  
<div class="text-center">
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
 <tr>
 <td align="center" width="625"><img src="/news/2010/07/23/conservatism2.jpg" alt="freerepublic2"></td>
 </tr>
</table>
</div></p>
<p>Literally, within minutes, the moderators spring into action and remove the thread. I clicked back a few times to capture what I could, but the first image above is all I could grab to prove this actually happened.</p>
<p>Now, we all know what Freerepublic is and isn&rsquo;t. Until the grassroots pressure was simply overwhelming, articles on illegal immigration were simply forbidden. You can threaten to nuke or even exterminate foreigners, but to suggest caution in letting those same people into the country is far more politically incorrect.</p>
<p>We all know conservative opinion leaders are cowardly. There might even be strategic reasons they feel they can&rsquo;t link to sites like Vdare.com or Amren.com. I don&rsquo;t have to like it but I get the reasons why and I accept that. Again, like I said the other day, we can complain about it, or attack them, or think of complicated reasons why they behave this way, but that won&rsquo;t make a difference. Save the comments about how &#8220;CONSERVATIVES ARE COWARDS AND DON&rsquo;T REALLY CARE ABOUT WHITES&#8221;  &mdash;  we know, we know.</p>
<p>However, I have to admit I was surprised here. This article here contained nothing that could be construed as crude or racist. The source was totally mainstream  &mdash;  it wasn&rsquo;t even Amren.com. It was a moderate conservative newspaper that tens of thousands of commuters read every day. Nor were there any real complaints  &mdash;  even the negative reactions expressed disagreement not &#8220;Jared Taylor is an EVIL NAZI.&#8221; And again, most of the reactions were positive, not in terms of white racial awareness, but in terms of &#8220;how is this controversial when you look at how everything nonwhites do is centered on race.&#8221; There was nothing here that could really hurt Freerepublic.com in any way whatsoever, even by today&rsquo;s PC standards.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, into the memory hole it goes. The entire implicit base of the modern conservative movement is white racial identity. The entire mission of the conservative gatekeepers seems to be preventing that from becoming explicit, even if that would guarantee victory for all the things conservatives claim to believe. Breaking through these gatekeepers while taking at least some of the conservative base and Tea Party types with us will be our hardest challenge.</p>

		<p>FR is fairly decent, but the problem is that Jim (not Will) Robinson is a big time censor, and a notorious coward on race.  BUT&hellip;allows UFO conspiracy mongering.  I was an occasional Freeper until the Robinsonator e-mailed me personally, twice, telling me to &#8220;knock it off,&#8221; &#8220;that&rsquo;s an order, boy,&#8221; etc etc.  (&#8220;Boy?&#8221;  How did he know my gender and be so presumptuous as to guess my age?)  Some people just have their priorities screwed up.</p>

		<p>Do you really believe that the powers that control this nation wish to see a reemergence of white doctrinal empowerment?  There can be no standing population group which, by it&rsquo;s intelligence, integrity, individualism and sense of (desire for) &#8216;separation from the masses&rsquo; might reempower nationalism.</p>
<p>The OWGers are flooding the world with multiculty to destroy the ethnic unity by which nations are built and sustained as leveraged strongholds for whatever physical and social evolutionary advantages existing conditions can allow to accrue to their resident populations.</p>
<p>They are anti-Darwinists in the purest sense of destroying any and all Island Environments wherein select genetic advantages can cause individuation of common species into truly new forms.</p>
<p>And anyone who gets in their socialist way is going to be beat down or better yet &#8216;deleted&rsquo; as an ideals source which is contrary to the norming process of accepting that &#8216;having everything you want&rsquo; as a materialistic surety is good enough, relative to the loss of a future guaranteed by good fences protecting those ideals.</p>
<p>After all, didn&rsquo;t you know?  The Constitution is just a piece of paper.  As long as your &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; are assured&hellip;</p>

I was banned from FR about 4 or 5 times and after my last expulsion, I didn&rsquo;t bother to re-register. That was about 5 years ago. Posting a link to AR was guaranteed to get you axed. Both Mr. Taylor and Pat Buchanan are dismissed as Nazis.</p>
<p>I occasionally check in to gage the tone of comments on various issues or to search for opinions on a specific story but commenting has become pointless; too many people see it as an opportunity to make trite and flippant jokes and there are people there who are on the hunt to find anyone who drifts into uncomfortable territory. (To be fair to people who weren&rsquo;t fair to me, I do understand the need to protect the board from provocateurs who try to taint the discussions with &#8216;racist&rsquo; remarks that could be used to brand FR as &#8216;racists&rsquo; or a hate site).</p>
<p>Often times, I was goaded to make &#8216;racist&rsquo; comments by posters who urged me to &#8216;say what I really meant&rsquo; and things of that nature. This was particularly egregious on posts concerning illegal aliens. Hispanic  posters were poised to pounce at any suggestion that Hispanic &#8216;immigration&rsquo; was anything but a great boon for the US.</p>
<p>I was as civil and thoughtfull as I am on this webpage but FR has their own standards and that&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s their board and they can run it as they please. However, you&rsquo;re not going to get into any substantive or in depth discussion about any issue as most comments have turned into, as I said before, making jokes.</p>
<p>Like many boards, it was fun while it was free but it no longer is. Too many &#8216;guards&rsquo; and trigger-happy posters poised with their fingers on the abuse button.</p>

		<p>I have long maintained that, second only to liberals, Responsible Conservatives(tm) are our greatest adversaries.  They are a tame pseudo-opposition whose goals are to avoid Offending anyone, to win the approval of liberals, and never in any way to behave contrary to their suicidal, self-abasing version of Christianity.  Racial extinction is A-OK with Responsible Conservatives, but the prospect of getting dirty looks from the other members of the congregation down at the country club makes them quail with fear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why conservatives always lose.  Whenever genuine conservatism   &mdash;   let alone racial common sense   &mdash;   rears its head, Respectable Conservatives unite in damning the apostates, convinced that if only Pat Buchanan would run for president again, the Second Coming would be upon us and we&rsquo;d all become color-blind aracial Americans.</p>
<p>The controlled Imperial governmedia loves Responsible Conservatives.  They can always be counted upon to denounce dissenters from Diversity, thereby effectively reinforcing the liberal/Marxist orthodoxy.<br>

		<p>We all know Jim Robinson is a fanatic on this subject, so I&rsquo;m not surprised by the removal.  I was banned twice from Free Republic years ago for expressing an even more moderated, toned down kind of race consciousness in connection to immigration. I was given no warning either time.  What I wonder now is if there will be any backlash at THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER.  Perhaps the obviousness of Obama&rsquo;s racial agenda, and the widespread disgust with it, have made it OK to allow people like Jared Taylor more access to the mainstream media, but I think it&rsquo;s also possible that this interview slipped past &#8220;the gatekeepers&#8221; (as Mr. Hood calls them) and will produce an outpouring of shame, guilt, begging for forgiveness, and pledges of &#8220;it will never happen again!&#8221; from whomever at WASHINGTON EXAMINER allowed this to happen.  We&rsquo;ll see!  </p>

<p>How true this is!  From most of your posts I feel and have felt for years the same as you. It seems I am crying in the wilderness whenever I try to inform family and friends about the dire situation we are in as a race. </p>
<p>Most just listen to the MSM and have been indoctrinated along the PC lines for years now. BTW, they all think I am a &#8220;racist&#8221;. I am, if being a racist is being racially aware and wanting our own land for White people only. We have tried the multiracial hell and it has been nothing but devastating to our race and our nation.</p>
<p> I want to cry sometime because I am so angry that my own race has allowed this and continue to allow it. Now, whenever I even look at White people at the store, malls, etc. I do not feel any common bond with them because I always wonder if they are all for this racial nightmare we are facing today.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s true.  Those who totally flame non-European ethnic groups and threaten them with acts of genocide are rewarded with webspace and a few are snatched up and punished for example.  Meanwhile, sensible people who are simply trying to protect the total elimination of Europeans with policy ideas that both enforce borders and strengthen ties to other ethnic groups are absolutely discarded.</p>

<p>I feel your pain, but please keep in kind that we&rsquo;re also being turned into the basest of slaves with zero freedoms. If we had our freedoms back, we could associate with whomever we choose or stay away from whomever we choose. We could determine who We the People want in our country and not take who the government wants in our country. Freedom (i.e. small government) is the key. </p>
<p>Sans freedom, we&rsquo;ll have death camps and most likely they will be for all whites and/or all religious people.</p>

I was also a former reader and occasional poster over at no-Free Republic, and, as was cited by several other posters - I was also a victim of the Jim Robinson hatchet, having posted a comment that was both reasonable and cordially pro-white and anti-the-NWO agenda to destroy all White majority nations, using massive legal or illegal immigration from the non-white Third World as the Cultural Marxist, white-genocide lusting, weapon of mass white racial destruction.  I decided to stop visiting Robinson&rsquo;s white genocide advocating, endless wars against all of the endless list of enemies of that one foreign nation web site sewer - and, I haven&rsquo;t been back since.   Jim Robinson can go straight to Hell, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.   He&rsquo;s a mortal enemy of every White Nationalist and is wearing the enemy&rsquo;s uniform.</p>
<p>Remember, fellow AR readers:  The ideology of Cultural Marxism clearly states - in it&rsquo;s own written literature - that their objective, in this war against the White Western nations, is to never allow those who they wish to destroy to have a platform or any opportunity to express their side of this argument or to be allowed to defend themselves.  That&rsquo;s why these same Cultural Marxists have been so obsessed with abolishing free speech and our First Amendment.   They fully understand how evil their ideology is - so, they cannot condone any debate or allow any counter arguments to be voiced.   Jim Robinson is a Cultural Marxist and is merely following this game plan.    Delete his website from your bookmark list and refuse to visit his website.   </p>
<p>I did, over 6 years ago - and believe me, it feels really good.    </p>

<p>This is baloney big time. White conservatives believe in a WHOLE RANGE of issues, of which only one is racial identity, racial realism, what ever you want to call it.</p>
<p>ONLY one issue of many that are of interest to the white conservative, but the one issue that gets the most attention. Forget the rest, say the critics.</p>
<p>Baloney.</p>

<p>You forget that we are living in a nation that considers Abraham Lincoln to be the greatest president in American history. What was Lincoln&rsquo;s greatest achievement? He was the greatest mass murderer of white Americans in all of human history. That is the great achievement by Lincoln, that makes white Americans to regard him as a great hero.</p>
<p>Some may quote a few race realist comments that Lincoln made in his debates with Sen. Stephen Douglas. But Lincoln is not considered heroic for those few race-realist comments. He is considered a hero for his killing of white Southerners.</p>
<p>The problem that white America faces is much deeper than the racial changes that have taken place since 1954. A white renewal would require, not just the repudiation of the black civil rights movement, but a repudiation of the popular narrative of the virtuous New England abolitionists, taking on the evil Southerners in the 1850s and 1860s.</p>
<p>We are more likely to see the American people embrace Buddhism, than adopt a race-realist world view.<br>

<p>Your passage does a better job disparaging &#8216;race-realists&rsquo; than it does the &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; movement? Just a possibility&hellip;</p>
<p>Even the name Race-realist isn&rsquo;t the most friendly sounding term. How about white activist? White actionist. White action master&hellip;</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m finding works when talking to conservatives. </p>
<p>Ask:  What will happen after November?</p>
<p>You know, after the votes are counted and conservatives/Republicans have taken back one or both Houses &hellip; what then?</p>
<p>The answer is that nothing changes.  Even if you boot out Obama in 2012 &hellip; nothing changes.</p>
<p>If you sit down with a rational conservative person and ask just how Humpty-Dumpty is going to get put back together, you&rsquo;ll find that they have no idea outside of shallow Glenn Beck-isms like &#8220;we return to the principles of the Founding Fathers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean like the one where Southern states demand that black be counted as 3/5ths of a man and Northern states didn&rsquo;t want them counted at all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That principle? Or how about the principles limiting the vote to property owners, denying the vote to women, booting indians out of white lands &hellip; those principles?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or do you have in mind a gentler form of returning to the Founding Fathers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If so &hellip; aren&rsquo;t you then bastardizing the original ideals and principles of these men just as much as liberals are?&#8221;  </p>
<p>There is no other answer besides what is routinely discussed here and on other white forums &hellip; whites must rule their own affairs.</p>
<p>By the way, I was recently on VNN and was making some head-way (I thought) with this idea.  Obviously, I must have been because Linder swooped down and booted me from the site.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pity because I was building an article describing his jewish connections while at CNN and the American Spectator and how I suspected that VNN was nothing more than a front organization working AGAINST white interests.  I discussed this with VNN members and someone ratted out.</p>
<p>Linder&rsquo;s other problem with me was that I challenged the VNN view that the Iraq War is being fought for Israel.  He and his useful idiots are convinced that all neo-cons are jews.  That&rsquo;s pretty funny considering that The American Spectator that Linder worked for got its money from the Bradley Foundation and the Bradley Foundation also supported Project For A new American Century &hellip; the biggest neo-con think-tank in the business.</p>
<p>Anyway, my point is this:  Our greatest value now lies in speaking with and recruiting WHITE CONSERVATIVES &hellip; not discredited WNs with hidden agendas like VNN and other equally useless forums that are in it for the money or as fronts for anti-white groups.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked amongst OURSELVES far too long.</p>
<p>We need to learn to speak to our fellow whites once more.<br>

		<p>And I thought I was the only one banned from Free Republic! Looks like this is getting to be a mighty big club. But it does go to indicate that mainstream conservatives are unable to deal with the real issues of our day. This is why, I think, they get so fanatic about such things as tax cuts. They can only deal with economic issues. It&rsquo;s a sort of vulgar Marxism of the right. Deeper cultural issues can not be addressed. Until conservatives decide they want to fight the culture war, they will be irrelevant to the struggles taking place in America. </p>
