			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jimmy So, CBS News, July 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sensational accusations of racism propagated by the far-right are depriving America of the chance to talk about more substantial issues like poverty and education, prominent racial scholars said Sunday on CBS&rsquo;s &#8220;Face the Nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Obama administration has been intimidated by the far-right wing, which is addicted to a kind of paranoia of race that then leads to paralyzing racial conversation,&#8221; Rev. Michael Eric Dyson, a professor of sociology at Georgetown University and an author of many books on African-American issues, said. &#8220;There&rsquo;s no word from the White House that&rsquo;s positive about the issue of race.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He added that the Tea Party movement has subjected President Barack Obama to absurd scrutiny over his birth certificate and portraying him &#8220;as an African witch doctor,&#8221; and that the far-right is an opposition that has &#8220;no interest in principled dialogue.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Abigail Thernstrom, the vice-chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, disagreed with Dyson&rsquo;s view of the Tea Party.</p>
<p>&#8220;A Gallup poll has shown the Tea Party movement is completely representative of America,&#8221; Thernstrom pointed out.</p>
<p>Wall Street Journal columnist John Fund backed Thernstrom&rsquo;s view by quoting one of her predecessors, Mary Frances Berry, former chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights under President Bill Clinton. Berry, who is now a sociology and history professor at the University of Pennsylvania, had said in an online discussion on Politico that &#8220;tainting the tea party movement with the charge of racism is proving to be an effective strategy for Democrats. There is no evidence that tea party adherents are any more racist than other Republicans, and indeed many other Americans. But getting them to spend their time purging their ranks and having candidates distance themselves should help Democrats win in November. Having one&rsquo;s opponent rebut charges of racism is far better than discussing joblessness.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson  &mdash;  who in a piece this week called &#8220;Signs of Sanity from the Tea Party,&#8221; said that a lot of racial controversies show that &#8220;too many Americans are searching for excuses to justify their rage&#8221;  &mdash;  told host Bob Schieffer that the media is making it look like there&rsquo;s a crisis of race &#8220;when in fact these are incidents in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dyson said the problem is that President Obama is not addressing the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the unfortunate reality is that there&rsquo;s a kind of gag order imposed on the Obama White House when it comes to issues of race,&#8221; Dyson said. &#8220;There&rsquo;s an understandable lamentation among the Obamanites that, look, we don&rsquo;t want to pigeonhole ourselves into the corner of race, so to speak. But at the same time what is sacrificed is clear and decisive action on behalf of, I think, valuable principles of racial negotiation.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Here we are, wasting all our time trying to neutralize Barack Obama, when we should have known all along that he&rsquo;s our secret tool.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re on this issue, Breitbart was on the radio talk show whose host was born Michael Alan Weiner last night.  He said that he put the whole video with the &#8220;epiphany&#8221; context up at first.  If anyone took the video OOC, it was the people who didn&rsquo;t watch the whole thing.  (And, on top of that, the context needs context   &mdash;   Miss Sherrod at first said she didn&rsquo;t know who Andrew Breitbart was, then 3 days later, accused him of wanting to sell her back into slavery.  In spite of her &#8220;epiphany,&#8221; Miss Sherrod continues to be a leftist kook.)  His point all along was to get back at the NAACP for the stupid tea party resolution.  If that was his aim, I think he could have picked a better course   &mdash;   To respond the way he did leaves the continuing impression that &#8220;racism&#8221; is wrong.  It would have been better for Breitbart to do what, e.g. James Edwards djoes, and that is, to show that &#8220;Racism&#8221; means nothing these days (if it ever has)   &mdash;   for most people that use it, it means white person.  Breitbart might have accidentally given credence to the NAACP&rsquo;s tea party resolution by finding &#8220;racism&#8221; on the part of the NAACP. </p>
<p>Of course, the NAACP passed this resolution based on the non-existent John Lewis smears and non-existent spitting, which, in spite of Breitbart&rsquo;s own hundred kilobuck bounty, has not yet been proven.</p>

		<p>How absurd is this that Michael Eric Dyson, one of the nation&rsquo;s most prominent race hustlers, is trying to claim that the far right is paranoid about race? He spends his career, and no doubt most of his free time, lambasting the White man for the ills of society and yet here this nitwit comes again to point the finger at Whites for daring to speak the truth about racial problems in this country. In his twisted worldview, the only proper discussion about race is blaming Whitey for Black and Brown sorrow. Well, White people are getting fed up with this sick double standard and we are starting to assert <i>our</i> rights. For too long have Whites been browbeaten into submitting to Black whining. No more! They want a discussion about race in America? Let&rsquo;s give it to them!</p>

		<p>&#8220;too many Americans are searching for excuses to justify their rage&#8221;</p>
<p>There may be something to that. Virtually all white men are &#8216;seething&rsquo; because they are not &#8216;hip&rsquo; enough? Why is it, when non-whites are angry or afraid the whole nation searches it&rsquo;s soul and promises to do better, but when whites are angry or afraid, this is seen as a symptom of how racist or bigoted they are and seen as a need to pass more laws against them?</p>

		<p>What garbage!  All the way around!</p>
<p>Obama doesn&rsquo;t mention race by name or word because he doesn&rsquo;t have to.  All the bruthas recognize he is giving them all that they want and ask for, and that Obama is just as racist as they are when it comes to taking from Whites and giving to Blacks.</p>
<p>WHEN are folks going to begin looking at ACTIONS instead of empty words as to the character of a person?  If you have an entire organization devoted to advancing ONLY the black race, that&rsquo;s racist.  If you immediately assume the black professor was right, and the affirmative action volunteer white cop was wrong, without any facts, THAT&rsquo;S racist.  If every bill you&rsquo;ve signed favors bailing out blacks from their defaulted mortgages, car loans, leases, disintegrating schools, self-acquired AIDS, inability to obtain Medicaid due to felonies, or other disqualifying factors of that like   &mdash;  - while bleeding the Whites who ARE employed of their money through enormous taxes THAT&rsquo;S RACISM.  I don&rsquo;t care if Obama says he is post racial and not aware of race.  HIS ACTIONS shows he HATES this country, HATES Whites, HATES entrepreneurs, HATES successful businessmen, has contempt for the Constitution and the &#8220;racist&#8221; founding fathers, has contempt for anybody who believes in a God other than Allah, and has absolute contempt for the rule of Law.  All things WHITE men do or achieved or adhere to.  It&rsquo;s NOT that he is merely a Marxist.  He is.  But he is a BLACK marxist.  He adheres to Marxism only in so far as it can benefit the BLACK man.  And himself, of course.  You better believe he loves the idea of money for himself; he just doesn&rsquo;t believe in EARNING it.  He believes in &#8220;redistributing&#8221; it.  </p>

		<p>Wow - George Orwell would blush at this level of creative double-speak! What a complete inversion of reality. This is, of course, precisely what fast-talking, race hustlers like Dyson excel at - standing the truth on its head, and counting on everyone&rsquo;s fear of being &#8220;racially insensitive&#8221; to block any challenge to his transparent nonsense!    </p>

<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re just saying I&rsquo;m racist because I&rsquo;m White.&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Racist doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, it&rsquo;s just a way to shut up White people.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Dyson is a race hustler who will do anything to keep himself in the public eye and make money.  The elites have no idea how most Americans feel.  Young people, by and large, are as race-realist as anyone else, whether they admit it or not.</p>

Good heavens. We want to talk about race. The PROBLEM is that Dyson (et. al.) only want to talk about race on THEIR terms, how THEY see and define problems, what THEY see as the solutions.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor, you should extend and invitation to Mr. Dyson to have a dialog on race. He&rsquo;ll say no of course, saying he doesn&rsquo;t discuss race with &#8216;racists&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>The &#8220;African Witch Doctor&#8221; convinced me that he was a race-conscious dirtbag when he called his own mother a &#8220;typical White person&#8221;, and the comment about our clinging to guns and religion didn&rsquo;t help. </p>
<p>When he needed money for college, he chose to be Barry Soetoro (Indonesian? Muslim?). He is half White. Did he mention that on his financial aid applications?</p>
<p>Need we quote his black empowerment church&rsquo;s &#8220;reverend&#8221; Wright? </p>
<p>Obama has given us a glaringly racist black attorney general, a black ineffectual secretary to the U.N., black Greeen Jobs Czar Van Jones, the holy victim Saint Shirley Sherrod, and hispanic Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, who is awfully concerned about the rights of illegal &#8220;undocumented&#8221; workers. </p>
<p>He has bowed to Arabs and Chinese and Japanese, while his wife pretentiously wrapped her arm around the Queen of England. His most unattractive wife stated, &#8220;As a black man, Barack can get shot going to the gas station.&#8221;</p>
<p>His economic advisor Richard Reich stated about stimulus funds, &#8220;I am concerned that these jobs &hellip; not simply go to &hellip; White male construction workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>EVERYTHING about Obama and his motley crew screams, as Stokely Carmichael said in the sixties, &#8220;Whitey, move on over, or we&rsquo;re gonna move on over you.&#8221;</p>

<p>No. The only &#8220;gag order&#8221; is when the media downplays all the racial goodies, giveaways and quotas for minorities that are being pushed through congress.</p>

		<p>I am amazed that, immediately after the Journolist story, CBS wll still hold such a &#8220;debate.&#8221; It has been ADMITTED by journalists themselves that accusing Republicans of racism is a tactic and one that they do not hesitate to use. That, then, makes every following airing of this type of &#8220;conversation&#8221; immediately not only suspect, but completely bogus.</p>
<p>Do they not realize the Journolist story is out there and that millions of Ameicans know that when they mention race, it is to make conservatives look bad and to change the topic of debate away from their man in the White House? If not, we should tell them know: The game is up. Any American who is the least bit knowledgeable KNOWS the racism sham is over. (I know, our problem is the millions of Americans who are NOT the least bit knowledgeable and who still watch trash like CBS news.)</p>
<p>They are despicable.</p>

		<p>It appears that Mr.Dyson is not happy with the idea of a discussion or dialog about race.  If it is not a monologue where black people are the perpetual victims and always considered right then its just racist paranoid whites who don&rsquo;t want to be tolerant and inclusive. &ldquo;I think the unfortunate reality is that there&rsquo;s a kind of gag order imposed on the Obama White House&#8221;,. Maybe Dyson means every time the current White House administration ignores or defends his white hating minions it seems like an order from Obama to makes white people gag.</p>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;re starting to shove back its stunning them. Good. They dont know what to do except, what they have done in the past&hellip;.its not working anymore. And I love it!</p>
<p>The 28th of next month is going to be the &#8216;showdown&rsquo; from what I understand, in D.C., the new pink panther party is supposed to be &#8216;marching&rsquo; alongside the Tea Party. I dont like the Tea Party because they are trying so hard to show theyre not (RACIST!!!). But they will have to very soon.</p>
<p>Let the games begin!<br>
