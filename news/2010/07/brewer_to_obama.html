			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>B. Chrysostom, Conservative Dating Site, June 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Governor Jan Brewer has just released another video message where she, once again, speaks out against Obama&rsquo;s complete failure to secure the US borders and help Arizona control the massive illegal immigration invasion plaguing that state.</p>
<p>Governor Brewer takes on Obama&rsquo;s lies that &#8220;our border is as safe as it has ever been&#8221; and she challenges the President to do his constitutionally mandated job of securing our borders and protecting the citizens of Arizona and of the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Governor Jan Brewer:<blockquote>Two weeks ago I met with President Obama. He promised that we would get word from his administration on what they were going to do to secure the border. Well, we finally got the message: These signs!</p>
<p>These signs calling our desert an active drug and human smuggling area. These signs warning people of danger and telling them to stay away.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re 80 miles away from the border and only 30 miles away from Arizona&rsquo;s capital. This is an outrage!</p>
<p>Washington says our border is as safe as it has ever been. Does this look safe to you?</p>
<p>What is our country coming to? We will not surrender any part of Arizona. We need to stand up and demand action!</p>
<p>Washington is broken Mr. President. Do your job! Secure our borders! Arizona and the nation are waiting!</blockquote.<>

		<p>By analogy: imagine that it is night and that your daughter has had her bath, has her pajamas on, and is ready for bed. You give her a kiss on her blushing cheek and say, &#8220;Good night, honey. Be careful as you walk down the hall to your bedroom in our own house  &mdash;  you might run into robbers or murderers or other nasty people who often pass through the sanctitiy of our own home. I, as your parent, should have prevented the invaders&rsquo; being here in our own home, but rest assured  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ve placed signs all over the house &hellip; reminding YOU to look out for THEM.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sleep well, kiddos.</p>

<p>You should come to NYC.  Ride the trains.  Walk the streets. Listen to the sick mayor. And we&rsquo;re 2,700 miles Northeast.  We&rsquo;re just as invaded up here, and we&rsquo;re surrounded by liberals and others who won&rsquo;t do a thing about it.</p>

		<p>The left is always telling us that illegals are almost entirely peaceful, hard-working folks whose only lawbreaking involves border crossing.  Yet the federal government&rsquo;s warning makes it sound like the forces of Pancho Villa are likely to be encountered!  </p>

		<p>Update: While Obama was publicly stroking minorities and showing us all his big, fat, warm, fuzzy heart yesterday at his pro-amnesty showcase, TWENTY-ONE Mexicans were killed in drug cartel fighting &hellip; TWELVE MILES AWAY FROM THE MEXICAN/AMERICAN BORDER. </p>
<p>Sleepless in NY, thank you for addressing our mutual concern. I have always wondered how you in NY stay sane as you are swimming in self-absorbed &hellip; non-White &hellip; foreigners from every corner of the globe. </p>
<p>By the way, you would be surprised how &#8220;mult-cultural&#8221; Arizona is. When we start cleaning house come July 29th, there are thousands of non-Mexican foreigners (Chinese and Arab students on expired visas, Korean and Turkish anchor baby mamas, et al) who need to pack up and get out of our Great State. The whole world is absolutely convinced that America is a big open party. </p>
<p>Just get in the door of the great land of opportunity, get a driver&rsquo;s license and an apartment &hellip; then stay. 70% of Chinese students will not leave America once they have arrived. HOW CONVENIENT.</p>

		<p>She needs to make a campaign out of this to rally support behind her. Many people agree with her but are afraid to say so. It doesn&rsquo;t help that Obama, Bloomberg, and big corporate CEOs are for amnesty. That will bully some people into silence. She could give speeches at gatherings like the chamber of commerce. Bring up on stage some supporters and other leaders so that the crowd sees a show of force.</p>
<p>This is really part of a bigger fight. It&rsquo;s not enough to secure the border. Internal enforcement at jobs, schools, hospitals, and local policing is needed to catch illegal aliens. Birthright citizenship has to be stopped. A supporting structure has to be put in place so that if we are successful now, this whole big mess doesn&rsquo;t happen again in a few decades.  </p>

		<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t make a bit of difference if it was McCain or Clinton in the White House.  This is a deliberate effort, not by &#8216;liberals&rsquo; or &#8216;neocons&rsquo; but by a conspiracy of big business to suppress wages and make the U.S. more &#8216;competitive, globally&rsquo; by forcing the middle class to either choose between living a much reduced lifestyle.  Or living like Mexicans and Asians do: 10 people to a house.  Each giving their welfare, social security or salary (not &#8216;payrole&rsquo; check, pure cash, it saves on taxes&hellip;) to a common cause of staying in a home built for SINGLE FAMILY occupancy.</p>
<p>Until we stop globalization.  Until we take the supranationalists and their corporate power structure OUT OF PLAY, the U.S. will continue to degrade until the idea of &#8216;nation&rsquo; (Latin: &#8216;Nescare&rsquo;, to be born) as an ethnically and culturally homogenous group) is nothing but a memory.</p>
<p>We really need a Constitutional Convention, secession or even it&rsquo;s threat merely achieves the same purpose of destroying our resource, land and cultural base through Balkanization.</p>
<p>Do not be so foolish as to think that the politicians don&rsquo;t see this and would not saddle up their destrier and come charging in to save the day, if they were allowed.  Politicians are loyal only to the moment&rsquo;s opinion.  And there is no doubt that this hot button topic has lit up the board with sufficient &#8216;majority vote&rsquo; belief that border control would be sure thing IF there wasn&rsquo;t something more powerful blocking the resolution of the issue.</p>
<p>That something is the elites who paid for this man&rsquo;s campaign.  We only got to elect from amongst the pool of candidates THEY had already pre-screened.</p>

		<p>This is the early stages of arizona raising its own military, sealing their portion of the border and then turning around and telling the federal government that since it cannot produce its basic functions, they no longer recognize it.</p>
<p>Such sentiment will spread far and wide.</p>
<p>There is only one cure at this point.  A republican government that comes in and immediately and aggressively implements a Ron Paul like agenda.</p>
<p>This could still happen&hellip;.but if it doesn&rsquo;t, the states are well on their way to basically splitting off.</p>

		<p>To poster #2.  I moved to NYC about ten years ago from white bread middle america.  Let me tell you, except for much of Manhattan, I feel like a total minority everywhere I go in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and central and lower Nassau county.</p>
<p>There are days when I am the ONLY white person I see, and that&rsquo;s with going all around to my job, to the store, to restaurants, etc&hellip;  It is so weird.  Try hanging out in downtown Flushing (99.9% Asian) or Jamaica (all black and west indian) or the Bronx (all latino/black).</p>
<p>When I look at all the buildings and homes in all these places, I imagine how they were just 50 years before when everyone was basically white (albeit white ethnics).  </p>

		<p>Sleepless in NY (#2).  Perhaps you recall baseball player John Rocker&rsquo;s January 2000 <i> Sports Illustrated </i> interview, where he described New York:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s the most hectic, nerve-racking city. Imagine having to take the 7 Train to the ballpark looking like you&rsquo;re riding through Beirut next to some kid with purple hair, next to some queer with AIDS, right next to some dude who just got out of jail for the fourth time, right next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids. It&rsquo;s depressing&hellip; The biggest thing I don&rsquo;t like about New York are the foreigners. You can walk an entire block in Times Square and not hear anybody speaking English. Asians and Koreans and Vietnamese and Indians and Russians and Spanish people and everything up there. How the hell did they get in this country?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, he had to apologize, and his apology was broadcast at the baseball stadium the next time he played in New York.  Indeed, the story of John Rocker could be an article for the monthly newsletter.</p>
