<h1>Duke Lacrosse Accuser Holds Press Conference to Defend Herself</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stanley B. Chambers Jr., News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), June 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With a motion bracelet strapped to her right ankle, Mangum, 31, held a press conference in front of a Savannah Avenue home this morning  &mdash;  where she is on house arrest  &mdash;  to defend herself against a February domestic violence arrest.</p>
<p>Mangum was arrested at her Lincoln Street home after police alleged that during an argument with her ex-boyfriend, she set the apartment on fire and tried to kill her now ex-boyfriend while her three young children and two Durham police officers were in the home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m going to get the justice that I deserve through the judicial system and I feel this my only and last means to reach out to the public and let them know that I did not set a fire that night,&#8221; she said while sitting in front of Savannah Avenue residence, unable to even walk to the driveway. &#8220;To let the public know that I am being unfairly treated due to preconceived notions that people have about me concerning another case. I feel like enough is enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mangum never mentioned the case by name during this morning&rsquo;s conference but believes it has led to the multiple charges from the February incident, including arson, child endangerment and attempted murder. She pleaded for her ex-boyfriend, who she said abused her, to come forward and tell the truth about what happened.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t explain to you why I keep going through issues with domestic violence,&#8221; she said, referring to past relationships. &#8220;Maybe it&rsquo;s mistakes. Maybe I tell men too much about my past and they try to take that for granted. Maybe domestic violence is more prevalent than people think.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The b/f in question is a black man, therefore her story is plausible.  On the other side, I think he has to be the most stupid adult man walking the face of the Earth, to hook up with a woman who has a proven track record of making up rape allegations and slandering and smearing her non-assailants.</p>

You know what crystal gale?? I agree with you. You didnt get what you deserved when you drove drunk. You didnt get what you deserved when you stole a taxi. You didnt get what you deserved when you led police on a high speed chase with that taxi and tried to kill a cop by running him over with it. You didnt get what you deserved when you FALSELY accused numerous young White men of raping you. And I have no reason to believe that you will get what you deserve for trying to kill another person, nor for setting an apartment on fire. </p>

		<p>She should have been charged with filing a fake crime report.  Had she been white, she would probably have gone to jail for at least a year.</p>

		<p>Why is this POS not locked up in the women&rsquo;s can, instead of house arrest? She&rsquo;s charged with arson and attempted murder, both felonies. Further, the state of Georgia should take her children away.</p>
<p>This is the woman to whom Jesse Jackson provided free tuition. A college education for this cockroach is a terrible thing to waste.</p>

<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s prevalent all right, in YOUR community, not ours:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Severe violence by husbands against wives is about four times more common among blacks as whites. Black wives assault their husbands at about twice the white rate&hellip;&#8221;</p>

Yes, for once she&rsquo;s right.  She&rsquo;s even telling the truth.<br>
She&rsquo;s NOT going to get the justice SHE DESERVES!<br>
And she never has thus far.  What a pity.</p>

<p>Mangum had sex with at least three or four men, prior to the Duke U. incident.</p>

		<p>Alas, the truth is out about this unstable and dangerous, lying criminal who is also all too typical of blacks too. She should have never been taken seriously by the police when she accused those young white men of raping her, who could have found far better white women to associate with than a lying criminal. Black women are dangerous for white men in more ways than one.</p>

		<p>No, Anonymous #4; she should not have been charged with filing a false police report.  &#8220;False Reporting&#8221; is when one deliberately lies to police about a misdemeanor.  Magnum did not accuse the Duke lacrosse players of a misdemeanor when she said they raped her.  She accused them of a felony.  Knowingly giving false information of a felony is not misdemeanor &#8220;false reporting&#8221;.  It is felony &#8220;obstruction of justice&#8221;, and this is what this psychopathic liar should be charged with, along with the psychopathic vote-whore ex-DA Michael Nifong.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to feel very sorry for this boyfriend.  After Magnum&rsquo;s &#8220;rape&#8221; hoax was in the news for as long as it was, along with other unsavory aspects of her past, any male of any race would have to be either a masochist or a certifiable lunatic in order to become involved with her.  </p>
<p>Magnum&rsquo;s utter lack of empathy for the Duke students she falsely and maliciously accused of &#8220;rape&#8221; marks her out as a psychopath.  Don&rsquo;t hang out with psychopathic people, because once they run out of other people to victimize, they&rsquo;ll get around to you, and your closeness will make you a very vulnerable target.  Her boyfriend should have seen this coming.</p>
