<h1>Waco Ross Store Accepts Pesos; Customers&rsquo; Reactions Mixed</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Megan Fleetwood, KWTX-TV (Waco), July 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Waco Ross Dress for Less Store has been accepting pesos in payment for clothes, accessories, decorations and more and customers&rsquo; reactions are mixed.</p>
<p>Some said Wednesday they&rsquo;re concerned the dollar could be devalued if the practice spreads to other businesses.</p>
<p>Customer Amy Silva told News 10, &#8220;I think we need to stand up and say, &#8216;Stop this.&rsquo; This is America, and we have an American dollar.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But other customers called the decision to accept Mexican currency a positive move.</p>
<p>Yolanda Reveles said, &#8220;A lot of people here that come from different places and have the pesos like you&rsquo;re talking about. So I think it&rsquo;s great if they can spend their money too.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some locally owned stores in the area also accept dollars and pesos, and the Pizza Patron chain began accepting Mexican currency more than three years ago.<br>

		<p>I would accept Pesos_if and only if there is a large surcharge, partially to make up for the inflation that rots the value of the Peso.</p>

		<p> UPDATE: Waco Ross Store Abruptly Stops Accepting Pesos<br>
The Waco Ross Dress for Less store was no longer accepting Mexican currency Thursday, but no one was saying why the store ended the practice.</p>
<p>Political Correctness is a night flower that shrivels and withers when exposed to the light of day.  PC is all powerful and all tyrannizing, yet it is no more substantial than a whiff of smoke.  The question is why whites don&rsquo;t stop the PC that is destroying them.  The tragedy is that it is so easy&hellip;..</p>

		<p>Perhaps a hundred years ago something like this would have bothered me.  As it stands today, the &#8220;dollar&#8221; is a dollar in name only.  In reality, there is nothing American about it.  It is the fiat currency of a gang of international criminals.  Why should we care if a retailer accepts the fiat money of another gang of criminals in addition to that of the criminals that audaciously call themselves our &#8220;elected officials&#8221;?</p>

		<p>I live in Waco and was just discussing this with my wife last night. Apparently there are several other local restaurants that have similar policies. My question is when will they start accepting silver coins?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d imagine that any business accepting pesos is passing on a hefty surcharge in terms of cutting the official exchange rate.  They&rsquo;d be stupid to do otherwise.</p>

		<p>I actually wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Ross stores everywhere were accepting pesos. I live in MD and every Ross store I&rsquo;ve ever been in is filled to the brim with illegals.</p>
