			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sun (London), July 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THE stunned black dad of a newborn, WHITE, baby girl declared yesterday  &mdash;  &#8220;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s my kid.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I just don&rsquo;t know why she&rsquo;s BLONDE.&#8221;</p>
<p>British Nmachi Ihegboro has amazed genetics experts who say the little girl is NOT an albino.</p>
<p>Dad Ben, 44, a customer services adviser, admitted: &#8220;We both just sat there after the birth staring at her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mum Angela, 35, of Woolwich, South London, beamed as she said: &#8220;She&rsquo;s beautiful  &mdash;  a miracle baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ben told yesterday how he was so shocked when Nmachi was born, he even joked: &#8220;Is she MINE?&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;Actually, the first thing I did was look at her and say, &#8216;What the flip?&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>But as the baby&rsquo;s older brother and sister  &mdash;  both black  &mdash;  crowded round the &#8220;little miracle&#8221; at their home in South London, Ben declared: &#8220;Of course she&rsquo;s mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blue-eyed blonde Nmachi, whose name means &#8220;Beauty of God&#8221; in the Nigerian couple&rsquo;s homeland, has baffled genetics experts because neither Ben nor wife Angela have ANY mixed-race family history.</p>
<p>Pale genes skipping generations before cropping up again could have explained the baby&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
<p>Ben also stressed: &#8220;My wife is true to me. Even if she hadn&rsquo;t been, the baby still wouldn&rsquo;t look like that.</p>
<p>&#8220;We both just sat there after the birth staring at her for ages  &mdash;  not saying anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctors at Queen Mary&rsquo;s Hospital in Sidcup  &mdash;  where Angela, from nearby Woolwich, gave birth  &mdash;  have told the parents Nmachi is definitely no albino.</p>
<p>Ben, who came to Britain with his wife five years ago and works for South Eastern Trains, said: &#8220;She doesn&rsquo;t look like an albino child anyway  &mdash;  not like the ones I&rsquo;ve seen back in Nigeria or in books. She just looks like a healthy white baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on: &#8220;My mum is a black Nigerian although she has a bit fairer skin than mine.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we don&rsquo;t know of any white ancestry. We wondered if it was a genetic twist.</p>
<p>&#8220;But even then, what is with the long curly blonde hair?&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Bryan Sykes, head of Human Genetics at Oxford University and Britain&rsquo;s leading expert, yesterday called the birth &#8220;extraordinary&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;In mixed race humans, the lighter variant of skin tone may come out in a child  &mdash;  and this can sometimes be startlingly different to the skin of the parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;This might be the case where there is a lot of genetic mixing, as in Afro-Caribbean populations. But in Nigeria there is little mixing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prof Sykes said BOTH parents would have needed &#8220;some form of white ancestry&#8221; for a pale version of their genes to be passed on.</p>
<p>But he added: &#8220;The hair is extremely unusual. Even many blonde children don&rsquo;t have blonde hair like this at birth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The expert said some unknown mutation was the most likely explanation.</p>
<p>He admitted: &#8220;The rules of genetics are complex and we still don&rsquo;t understand what happens in many cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>The amazing birth comes five years after Kylie Hodgson became mum to twin daughters  &mdash;  one white and the other black  &mdash;  in Nottingham.</p>
<p>Kylie, now 23, and her partner Remi Horder, now 21, are both mixed race.</p>
<p>Even so the odds were estimated at a million to one.</p>
<p>The Sun told in 2002 how a white couple had Asian twins after a sperm mix-up by a fertility clinic.</p>
<p>Yesterday three-day-old Nmachi&rsquo;s churchgoing mum Angela admitted that she was &#8220;speechless&#8221; at first seeing her baby girl, who was delivered in a caesarean op.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;I thought, &#8216;What is this little doll?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&rsquo;s beautiful and I love her. Her colour doesn&rsquo;t matter. She&rsquo;s a miracle baby.</p>
<p>&#8220;But still, what on earth happened here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her husband told how their son Chisom, four, was even more confused than them by his new sister.</p>
<p>Ben said: &#8220;Our other daughter Dumebi is only two so she&rsquo;s too young to understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;But our boy keeps coming to look at his sister and then sits down looking puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re a black family. Suddenly he has a white sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ben continued: &#8220;Of course, we are baffled too and want to know what&rsquo;s happened. But we understand life is very strange.</p>
<p>&#8220;All that matters is that she&rsquo;s healthy and that we love her. She&rsquo;s a proud British Nigerian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Queen Mary&rsquo;s Hospital said: &#8220;Congratulations to Angela and her family on the birth of their daughter.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The baby has African features if you look at the original article and film.  Although still quite an odd occurrence.  I would say a DNA test is in order to see of this is indeed a miracle.  My main question is, however, is why Britain needs to import railroad workers from Nigeria?<br>

		<p>This story is probably a hoax, or if true, undeserving of any attention from decent people, which is why its front page news.</p>
<p>The message we are supposed to absorb, especially school children, is that Whites came from Africans because Adam and Eve were African Monkeys whose descendants migrated out of Africa and put a little African in all of us, especially the blonde, blue eyed Europeans.</p>
<p>This story is all about &#8220;All Men Are Created Equal&#8221; and that race is just a social construct.  We are now supposed to see the African within us through the White Skin of the White Baby born to black parents.</p>
<p>We are all ONE FAMILY. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep an eye on this wonder angel who unites all humanity through its uniqueness.  She will be promoted as the new Mother Mary through whom we can be forgiven for our racism if we just acknowledge that blacks are really White People and promise that we will never discriminate and will always Diversify Ourselves into Blackness.</p>
<p>Breaking down social and racial barriers one freakish mutation or media race hoax at a time.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d say a DNA test would reveal that neither one is the mother or father of this child.  Is the London Sun the equivalent of the National Enquirer in the US?  This must be some kind of publicity stunt with the message that we&rsquo;re all the same.  If that woman physically gave birth to that child then it was done through invitro-fertilization with donor egg and sperm.  </p>

		<p>If this is truly a genetic rarity, then it stands to reason that there ought to be another case like this from many years ago, and another from many before that, and others from once in a blue moon.  Where are the analogues?</p>

		<p>It is about time we had some good news. This is absolutely wonderful. I hope having this special baby motivates the parents to lead a productive and self-sufficient lifestyle.<br>
My only concern is that the couple must never take that baby to Nigeria, (or anywhere in Afrostan). We all know what will happen then.<br>
Also, I hope they do more genetic studies with this case.</p>

		<p>Readers of the Iliad may remember how &#8220;Daedalus wrought a dancing floor for the fair haired daughters of Libya&#8221;. Libya in those days was the whole of North Africa west of Egypt and the Libyans were the people now called Berbers. The modern people of the region are mainly Arabic speaking Moslems of mixed race (with a large black component) but pure-blooded Berber tribes still exist here and there and they are white skinned, blue eyes are not uncommon, and fair hair sometimes occurs particularly among children. A year or two ago there was a fuss in the British press about a very blonde little girl seen in Morocco who, it was thought, might be a missing British toddler, in fact she&rsquo;s a Rif Berber.</p>
<p>There has been trade and traffic across the Sahara between North Africa and the black south for very many centuries. The earliest black kingdoms arose in the Sahel along the southern edge of the desert and their first, legendary, dynasties were &#8220;white&#8221;, so they arose through Berber penetration. Before their conversion to Islam the gods of the black peoples of the region were white, and a belief in white gods persisted into the 20th century in the deep interior of Africa (and may still do for all I know).</p>
<p>So it is quite certain that there is a thin thread of Berber ancestry among the blacks of West Africa. This couple, surely, are both of that ancestry, the right combination of genes has occurred and a genetic accident has followed - exactly as happens when a white South African couple very occasionally find themselves with a black baby. </p>

		<p>Obviously blood tests to confirm paternity come first. </p>
<p>Second, even if of true parentage, the baby would still carry the Nigerian genes for IQ, behavorial tendencies, etc, despite one or a few mutations of skin color.</p>
<p>Personally, I also suspect the mum had cheated with a white man, becuz the genetic probabilities indicate as such: </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the order of, maybe a 1,000,000X more likely the baby resulted from WM/BF coupling rather than from BM/BF. </p>

<p>I DON&rsquo;T. No way.  She would be, in that case, a mulatto. But there is no evidence at all of ANY mixed ancestry   &mdash;   not the slightest.</p>
<p>Sounds most likely to me that babies got mixed up at the hospital.</p>
<p>Also, I would be highly suspicious of anything I read in a British tabloid. That is not the proper source for accurate information.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.  A mulatto would have coffee colored skin and nappy hair.  If this is for real, and that&rsquo;s a big &#8220;if&#8221;, this was done by implanting a fertilized egg into the mother and her carrying it to birth.  It&rsquo;s not very common but some White men with black wives use them as surrogates carrying their children from a donated egg. It&rsquo;s a way of saying I love you but I think your inferior.  <br>

		<p>It couldn&rsquo;t be a hospital mixup.  The people who delivered her must have noticed that the baby is White.  My son was born with a full thick head of hair like hers.</p>
<p>Black albinos have yellow, not white hair.  I have heard that black babies usually darken after they are born.</p>
<p>We need more information.</p>
<p>When twins of different race are born, it is because the Mom hadsex with 2 different men during ovulation.  If Mom and both men are the same race no one knows.  If Mom and one man are White or Asian and the other man is black it is obvious what Mom has been up to.</p>
<p>If Mom is White and one man is Asian and one man is White sometimes it takes a little time to figure out what happened.</p>
<p>Still, verrry interesting.</p>

That&rsquo;s what I like about Amren.  Race Realists have vitally insightful perspectives that cut through all the lies and shows us the alternative aspect of any story.  Paradigm shift, and all that.  Shifting the paradigm into correct Race perceptions.   Race Realism, in other words.</p>
<p>People who worry and fret and obsess over race issues automatically boost their IQ&rsquo;s by 10 points.   We can all start that surge with reading Hinton Rowan Helper daily.</p>
<p>When we &#8220;act stupidly&#8221;, we really are just &#8220;increasing our intensity&#8221; at making &#8220;dangerous discoveries&#8221;.</p>
<p>Racism isn&rsquo;t just right, it&rsquo;s also fun, enlightening, and uplifting!</p>
<p>Who ever thought that racism was the cure? </p>
<p>Racism is a life affirming and life sustaining habit. </p>

		<p>This does happen in Africa, and when it does as most of  you readers will recall, they are hunted down and killed since their body parts are used by witchdoctors for magic cures and hexes.  </p>
<p>And that is basically the general thread of things when it comes to black and white relations, the black hunts the white for its magic - money, success, sexual alure, whatever it might be, they follow us and use us.  Slavery!, a liberal will spit back at me, but who is better off today, the black in Africa, or the long ago emancipated slave in North America?  It was a tough boat ride for all of us back then!</p>

		<p>I wish to clarify my earlier statement, which &#8220;Anonymous 8:43PM&#8221; disputes:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s on the order of, maybe a 1,000,000X more likely the baby resulted from WM/BF coupling rather than from BM/BF.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
What I had meant is this:</p>
<p>A child of such phenotype is statistically unlikely *even from a WM/BF coupling*. But at least the white-skin blonde-hair cards are shuffling somewhere in the genetic deck.</p>
<p>But a spontaneous mutation in hair AND skin color to parents without the genes *is even closer to zero*. If the probability of WM/BF is p, the probability of BM/BF is like, p-squared, or p-raised-to-1,000. </p>
<p>And *if* the parentage is true, it&rsquo;s highly probable the two Nigerian parents have some WASP stock mixed in from the colonial era. <br>

		<p>This is a fraud.  It&rsquo;s a hoax designed to soften up White people.<br>
White skin and Blond hair to boot!!  Give me a break!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like:  You see folks, we all came from Black people.  They are the mothers and fathers of the human race.  They are the people from which all life comes.  And naive Whites - especially White women - will marvel in awe and wonderment, while they hopefully choose a Black male as a mate thinking, Oh maybe I can have a blond-haired, blue-eyed baby if only I can find a Black-enough man!</p>
<p>This is how they pervert and deceive us into believing utter nonsense.  Don&rsquo;t fall for it folks.</p>

		<p>Actually, this has happened before. I read ten years ago or so about another British Nigerian family with <i>three</i> white children, with blond hair and greenish eyes (also apparently not albinos, otherwise they&rsquo;d have pinkish eyes like albino rats and rabbits).</p>
<p>Since these are not albinos, and I&rsquo;ve only heard of this happening in Britain, perhaps in a certain number of cases among Nigerians, the melanin-producing cells in the developing fetus turn off due to the low sunlight at Britain&rsquo;s latitude. </p>
<p>Even so, these white Africans are still Africans, with the low IQ and whatnot, and not Europeans. Also, in both cases (now and ten years ago), the parents had English first names but gave their children African ones (what&rsquo;s up with that?). If one wants children who actually look like Swedes to arise from this phenomenon, the Sun should keep a close watch on high-caste Tamil or Sri Lankan couples in Britain or Canada rather than Africans, since while dark-skinned, they&rsquo;re actually Caucasian.</p>

		<p>This could start a new trend. Once genetics experts figure out how this is possible, assuming it is not a hoax, then they will want to duplicate it.

		<p>No DNA analysis appears to have been undertaken which is rather odd!</p>
<p>Personally, I suspect the child <b>is</b> indeed Albino, not that this is anything to be ashamed of, of course.</p>
<p>The mother, in an interview, denied the child is Albino because she says, the child&rsquo;s eyes are found <i>to be clear</i> with no pink present.  I&rsquo;m of the opinion she was instructed to answer thus.</p>
<p>The fact is, Albino peoples&rsquo; eyes do not have to be pink at all.</p>
<p>Quote:<br>
<i>&#8220;Although people with albinism may experience a variety of eye problems, one of the myths about albinism is that it causes people to have pink or red eyes. <b>In fact, people with albinism can have irises varying from light gray or blue to brown.</b> (The iris is the colored portion of the eye that controls the size of the pupil, the opening that lets light into the eye.) If people with albinism seem to have reddish eyes, it&rsquo;s because light is being reflected from the back of the eye (retina) in much the same way as happens when people are photographed with an electronic flash.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Quote:<br>
<i>&#8220;Albinism is a rare disorder found in fewer than five people per 100,000 in the United States and Europe. Other parts of the world have a much higher rate; for example, <b>albinism is found in about 20 out of every 100,000 people in southern Nigeria.&#8221;</b></i></p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always wondered what the supposed appeal is in these stories about white women supposedly having different-race twins or black women having white babies and so on.  It must be the one-family theory postulated by #3.  <br>
Anyway, this child COULD be a mutation.  Most evolutionary theories, for instance, hold that the various races occurred because of mutations.  Or the child could be the result of recessive genes in either both the black parents or in the mother and some other man.  When Nigeria was a British colony, some admixture certainly occurred, and this couple could easily not know the entire family histories going back generations.  <br>
Most of us have seen identifiably or self-proclaimed black people with blue eyes and/or blonde hair.  Google a photo of Houston mayor Bill White, for instance.  <br>
The idea of race is not just a social construct, as many liberals claim, but terms like &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;white&#8221; ARE merely handy words we use that everyone understands.  Most American blacks have white admixture, and some whites have Native or even a drop of African heritage.  If the liberals want a post-racial society, they should stop going into paroxyms over something like the birth of this baby.</p>

		<p>Stranger things have happened, but at least I&rsquo;ve never heard of a white couple having an African looking baby.</p>
<p>I strongly suspect that when the British were controlling Nigeria, that 100 years ago some white soldier or trader got it on with one of the natives.  The mutation then popped out now!  </p>
<p>Or, when Arab traders were plying West Africa centuries ago, something similar occurred (many Arabs have a lot of caucasian in them).  Also, many Nigerians have straighter hair than other Africans due to mixing with Arab traders for 500 years.</p>
<p>In any case, I also suspect that the baby will darken over time and the hair as well.</p>
<p>I had a black student once who said that when he was younger he had blue eyes because one of his grandfather&rsquo;s was an Irishman who married his black grandmother.  The student was bitter, saying that through the years his eye color has progressively darkened to where the blue disappeared leaving a kind of muddy greyish black.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to give this couple the benefit of the doubt.  Other articles have cited that the husband is a Christian, and he does not believe his wife was unfaithful. The couple has two previous children, both black, and they appear to be an intact family.  Why would a mother with two young children and a provider risk her stability?  If she has been unfaithful, a DNA test would be irrefutable evidence soon enough, and I doubt the family would be posing together and vouching for each other&rsquo;s integrity. </p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not going to rule out the possibility of white lineage or some very rare mutation.  While both parents deny having Caucasian heritage, the father has mentioned that someone in his family has blue eyes. There you go: a clue. Also&hellip;look at the parents&rsquo; hands in the picture above.  They aren&rsquo;t as dark as some Africans I&rsquo;ve seen. </p>
<p>In South America there is a family with people covered in hair,like primates (possibly due to a throwback gene, or a gene from millions of years back.)  Parthenogenesis (development of an unfertilized egg) has occurred in some mammalian species.  Women have given birth to children from eggs within their bodies but not their &#8220;own,&#8221;  due to a Dark-Half type situation in which their twin died in utero and its gametes lived on in the surviving twin.  Strange things do happen.  Who knows?  Perhaps the situation described in this article is part of how the white race came into existence. </p>
<p>Granted, the media will take advantage of this couple&rsquo;s situation to encourage the idea that &#8220;we&rsquo;re all the same,&#8221;  but this family did not (as far as we know) ask for an unusual situation. They have to accept it, and accept their child. I condemn the people who will exploit this family for their liberal racial agenda, but I don&rsquo;t condemn the parents themselves.  </p>
