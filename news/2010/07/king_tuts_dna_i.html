<h1><a href="https://www.eutimes.net/2010/06/king-tuts-dna-is-western-european/">King Tut&rsquo;s DNA Is Western European</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>EU Times, June 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Despite the refusal of the Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, Zahi Hawass, to release any DNA results which might indicate the racial ancestry of Pharaoh Tutankhamen, the leaked results reveal that King Tut&rsquo;s DNA is a 99.6 percent match with Western European Y chromosomes.</p>
<p>The DNA test results were inadvertently revealed on a Discovery Channel TV documentary filmed with Hawass&rsquo;s permission  &mdash;  but it seems as if the Egyptian failed to spot the giveaway part of the documentary which revealed the test results.</p>
<p>Hawass previously announced that he would not release the racial DNA results of Egyptian mummies  &mdash;  obviously because he feared the consequences of such a revelation.</p>
<p>On the Discovery Channel broadcast, which can be seen on the Discovery Channel website <a href="https://dsc.discovery.com/videos/king-tut-unwrapped-king-tuts-paternal-line.html" target="tut-dicovery" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here.</b></a>here,</a> or if they pull it, on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNmZQJsRjrc&amp;feature=related" target="tut-youtube" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here.</b></a>here,</a> at approximately 1:53 into the video, the camera pans over a printout of DNA test results from King Tut.</p>
<p>Firstly, here is a brief explanation of the results visible in the video. It is a list of what is called Short Tandem Repeats (STRs).</p>
<p>STRs are repeated DNA sequences which are &#8220;short repeat units&#8221; whose characteristics make them especially suitable for human identification.</p>
<p>These STR values for 17 markers visible in the video are as follows:</p>
<p>DYS 19  &mdash;  14 (? not clear)<br>
DYS 385a  &mdash;  11<br>
DYS 385b  &mdash;  14<br>
DYS 389i  &mdash;  13<br>
DYS 389ii  &mdash;  30<br>
DYS 390  &mdash;  24<br>
DYS 391  &mdash;  11<br>
DYS 392  &mdash;  13<br>
DYS 393  &mdash;  13<br>
DYS 437  &mdash;  14 (? not clear)<br>
DYS 438  &mdash;  12<br>
DYS 439  &mdash;  10<br>
DYS 448  &mdash;  19<br>
DYS 456  &mdash;  15<br>
DYS 458  &mdash;  16<br>
DYS 635  &mdash;  23<br>
YGATAH4  &mdash;  11</p>
<p>What does this mean? Fortunately, a genius by the name of Whit Athey provides the key to this list. Mr Athey is a retired physicist whose working career was primarily at the Food and Drug Administration where he was chief of one of the medical device labs.</p>
<p>Mr Athey received his doctorate in physics and biochemistry at Tufts University, and undergraduate (engineering) and masters (math) degrees at Auburn University. For several years during the 1980s, he also taught one course each semester in the electrical engineering department of the University of Maryland. Besides his interest in genetic genealogy, he is an amateur astronomer and has his own small observatory near his home in Brookeville, MD.</p>
<p>He also runs a very valuable website called the &#8220;Haplogroup Predictor&#8221; which allows users to input STR data and generate the haplogroup which marks those STR data.</p>
<p>For those who want to know what a haplogroup is, here is a &#8220;simple&#8221; definition: a haplogroup is a group of similar haplotypes that share a common ancestor with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutation.</p>
<p>Still none the wiser? Damn these scientists.</p>
<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s try it this way: a haplotype is a combination of multiple specific locations of a gene or DNA sequence on a chromosome.</p>
<p>Haplogroups are assigned letters of the alphabet, and refinements consist of additional number and letter combinations, for example R1b or R1b1. Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA haplogroups have different haplogroup designations. In essence, haplogroups give an inisight into ancestral origins dating back thousands of years.</p>
<p>By entering all the STR data inadvertently shown on the Discovery video, a 99.6 percent fit with the R1b haplogroup is revealed.</p>
<p>The significance is, of course, that R1b is the most common Y-chromosome haplogroup in Europe reaching its highest concentrations in Ireland, Scotland, western England and the European Atlantic seaboard  &mdash;  in other words, European through and through.</p>
<p>So much for the Afro-centrists and others who have derided the very obvious northwestern European appearance of a large number of the pharonic mummies. It seems like March of the Titans was right after all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>

		<p>The Afro-centrists will not be stopped by DNA analysis.  King Tut will remain a black African, as it is taught in African studies.  This changes nothing as they are concerned.</p>

		<p>Fascinating (not that I understand it). But it seems like the relatively new science of DNA testing holds the potential of clearing up all kinds of historical &#8220;mysteries.&#8221; I&rsquo;m not talking about nonsense like &#8220;Did Thomas Jefferson have any illegitimate children?&#8221; but substantial questions involving large populations of people that have influenced the entire course of history. It has the potential of clearing up these &#8220;mysteries,&#8221; but only if we&rsquo;re willing to open our eyes.</p>

		<p>Black supremists won&rsquo;t like this information too much.  Hawass knows full well that the DNA sequence of King Tut is defitnitely not African.  He got in a dust-up a few years ago when some American blacks demanded he take the bust of Tut down in an exhibit while in Memphis because it didn&rsquo;t look African.  Hawass told them where to go.  He needs to release this information once and for all so people can see just who the Egyptians were.</p>

		<p>I think it is a useless sensation. The haplogroup predictor gives nothing more concrete than &#8220;R1b&#8221;, which is an ambiguous finding, because there also exists an African branch of R1b. Hence I would bet that it will be the African R1b, neither the Western European nor the Anatolian lineage of R1b.</p>

		<p>If anyone reading this hasnt had a DNA test I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>Sense we are on the subject of haplogroups (HG), I would just like to point out that HG R1b is a migrant to Europe. yes it is true that majority of Europeans are R1b, but this HG is also shared with Asia. the true original HG of Europe is Haplogroup I. It is rarely found outside of Europe and split from HG IJ 30,000+ years ago which migrated from the fertile crescent.<br>
  HG I1a or I1 is only found in Scandinavia<br>
  HG I2 is found on the island of Sardina, Italy, and Croatia  <br>
These are both Subclads of HG I.</p>

<p>Right, the consequences ONLY from black Americans who take their Afrocentrist stuff very seriously, much to their detriment. Break the news to them really slowly and carefully, in hushed tones or else!</p>

<p>The EU Times is published where? They have read &#8220;March of the Titans&#8221;? That surprises me.</p>
<p>And too, Tut lived during the Middle Kingdom? So Egypt had rulers like him for 1,700 years prior and for some time after that too?</p>

		<p>I remember a few years ago how the once respectable and totally objective National Geographic magazine had a big article claiming some of the pharahos were black African. In fact, it made the magazine&rsquo;s cover. Of course no mummy DNA was tested to prove this claim, just mere speculation thousands of years later by people wanting to no doubt re-write history in a PC friendly way.  </p>

		<p>All you had to do was look at the art inside the tombs that clearly displays fair-skinned, sharp-featured Egyptian masters overseeing dark-skinned, wide-nostriled slaves and you could have figured this out on your own, no genetic study required.</p>
<p>Why do they fear the truth so, these supposed seekers of wisdom, that they have to attempt to bottle it up?  I guess it sort of makes sense that a modern-day Egyptian wouldn&rsquo;t want to hear that it was white men who built the monoliths, but you can bet your bottom dollar there are plenty of self-loathing whites that would have been more than willing to cover it up as well. </p>
<p>And there are those who say these kind of folks need MORE power to decide how we live our lives, and more importantly how we think.</p>

<p>The March of the Titans isn&rsquo;t the only history book that gives definitive detail about the role blacks played in Egypt, most every valid book on ancient history verifies that blacks were defeated several different times in many battles by the Egyptians for years and were brought back to Egypt as slaves.</p>
<p>In one series of battle encounters alone, 70,000 blacks were returned to Egypt in bondage.  That&rsquo;s no secret, except to the desperate Afro-Centrist blacks who can only claim accomplishment on anything by stealing another race&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Like every other pathology, blacks have a larger percentage of liars in their ranks than any other race of people on the face of the earth.</p>

		<p>In many places, now, where non-Europeans are in positions of authority which impact Archaeology, findings are being suppressed.  I&rsquo;m hardly an expert: but I recall that Kennewick Man and many similar finds are being kept from scientific analysis by Native American groups, despite the more-than-remote likelihood that the bones belong to those groups&rsquo; ancestors.  In China, there is increasing resistance to Western access to remains of the Tocharians. And now, this.</p>
<p>Many thanks to whoever it was who leaked the information.  I always chided myself for feeling a kinship to Tut.  But NOW&hellip;</p>

		<p>Children that grow up and read outside sources eventually learn the truth, which is that the founders of many supposedly &#8220;brown&#8221; civilizations were ARYAN:</p>
<p>Persia was founded by Aryans.<br>
Egypt was founded by Aryans.<br>
India was founded by Aryans.</p>
<p>What is the lesson? The Indian caste system (preservation of the White race against race-mixing) failed, India crumbled to the brown mess that it is today.  Persia fell from its glory as it turned relatively browner.  Egypt began its precipitous fall around Taharka (a mulatto-black pharaoh).</p>
<p>Take note that America has its first mulatto-black president  &mdash;   not a good sign for America&rsquo;s future, for those who have a broad view of history and civilization.</p>
<p>P.S. Note the ample evidence of Egyptians enslaving, capturing by war, selling, and trading blacks.  Note the artwork that clearly shows a group of black people, far darker than anyone else.  The gall and ignorance of the &#8220;black Egypt&#8221; people is an embarrassment to all Africans.</p>

		<p>The saddest thing is that the information had to be hushed up for fear of the &#8220;consequences.&#8221;  The only reason we know it is because they accidentally aired it and someone got a screen cap of it.  </p>
<p>If I were black, I would be ashamed that my race has to be so babied and protected and coddled, that other races have to walk on eggshells because of my race&rsquo;s hypersensitivity.  </p>
<p>I remember a few years back, Marlon Brando gave a TV interview where, to make some point, he rattled off a bunch of racial slurs.  He wasn&rsquo;t calling anybody those names, he was just listing them for some reason.  All of the slurs were aired on TV except the &#8220;N&#8221; word, which was bleeped.  The message was clear.  Blacks are the most touchy of all the races.  Blacks must be babied and coddled.  While Asians, Whites and Hispanics can hear a slur about themselves and realize the context of it and not get upset, blacks will throw a hissy fit.<br>

		<p>For people who are seriously want to know the origin of the races and the consequent migrations of the races to different areas/continent look to the Urantia Book.  It can also be read online.  Within that book, it speaks of the orgins of the advanced Egyptians.  The Egyptians who build the advanced civilization are NOT of black genes.  Rather the blacks migrated into Egypt from the sub Saharan and eventually destroying that advanced civilization.  Thereby, forcing the best families to eventually leave and to settle on Crete.  They took to Crete with knowledge of plumbing, architecture, farming, brought livestock, seeds, etc.</p>
<p>Some of the statues of the Pharaohs appear to look Asian because the genetic make-up of the advanced Egyptians were of Eskimo and Adam and Eve genes.  The descendents of Adam and Eve had fair skin, eyes, hair.  The second Garden of Eden was in Iraq between the two rivers of Tigris and Euphrates.  The present white race are pre-dominately of the blue race and Adam and Eve descendents.  The original Greeks and Aryans (of India) were of Adam and Eve descendents.  Most of the descendents of Adam and Eve migrated to Europe going through Russia.  At one point, Denmark was their capital.  It is because of the Adam and Eve genes that the technological advances on this planet have been so rapid.  Adam and Eve came onto this planet 35,000 years ago.  </p>
<p>Humanity did not originate out of Africa nor from black genes.  The Eskimos were the original humans.  The colored races were born to an Eskimo couple.  In the early days of this planet, blacks also migrated into the southern part of Europe from Africa.  </p>
<p>Within the Urantia Book, it is warned that the future and survival of this country hinge on the quality of peoples let in.<br>

		<p>I agree with one of the above posts.  R1b paternal ancestry (without any knowledge of its subclade) is rather ambiguous.  The forensic reconstructions from his skull models, as well as artistic renderings during his lifetime, point to a North African Caucasoid.  I should remind everyone that the Governor of NY state, David Patterson, has R1b haplogroup of the English variety, and who among us would classify him as White?.  My bet is that Tut&rsquo;s R1b is the Anatolian type, likely derived from the Hittites who had extensive contacts with the Egyptians from the late 2nd millenium BCE onwards.  We need mtDNA as well as some autosomal data on Tut before we call him 100% White.</p>

		<p>Arthur Kemp&rsquo;s March of the Titans is compulsory reading for anyone interested about the history of the White Race.  </p>
<p>Mr. Kemp states that Whites originated in the Black Sea area and then spread north, south, west and to a degree east.  The Egyptians, Greeks and Romans were all Whites. Simply look at the statues and than there are descriptions of the Greeks being blonds. A mummy sits in the museum in London named Ginger, with red hair.</p>
<p>Egyptians had strong segregation laws and there efforts were to keep the Blacks from moving northward up the Nile. They were not successful. At the end of the Egyptian period, the mummies of the Pharoahs had distinct African features. (So those proposing Egyptians as African are not completely incorrect.)  </p>
<p>The Egyptians, Greeks and Romans societies declined and disappeared because of massive immigration. The importation of slaves into Rome caused it to become less Roman and to finally collapse.</p>
<p>The book is grim reading.  But invaluable for an understanding of both our history and preventing its collapse.  The book can be found on the internet. It is a massive 500 pages, 8.5 by 11 <br>
inches.   </p>
<p>It would be wonderful if Mr. Kemp would produce a shorter version of the book, concentrating only on the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans.</p>

<p>I have a copy of the National Geographic magazine you are referring to, and it is the issue of February, 2008. It mentions the invasion of Egypt by the black Nubian king, Piye, in 730 BC, during a time that Egypt was torn apart by civil war. Piye established Egypt&rsquo;s 25th dynasty, which was the time when Nubian kings ruled over Egypt. Nubian rule over Egypt lasted nearly 80 years. The National Geographic article was based on the work of the respected Swiss archaeologist, Charles Bonnet.</p>
<p>But most of the Pharaohs who ruled over Egypt were neither black nor white. They were brown-skinned caucasians, who traced their ancestry to the Middle East. Egypt did have some white rulers, especially after the country was conquered by the Macedonian Greeks, under Alexander the Great. Cleopatra was a descendant of the Macedonian Greek conquerers of Egypt. </p>

<p>I have a broader definition of &#8220;Caucasian&#8221; than some here on AmRen, so I&rsquo;m happy to accept King Tut as &#8220;one of us&#8221; and induct him (posthumously) into the ranks of our illustrious but endangered species. &#8220;99.6% white&#8221; is good enough for me. </p>
<p>Although I must say that with Tut&rsquo;s penchant for gaudy gold bling-bling and the general ostentatiousness of his crib, Egypt&rsquo;s Boy King may have been white, but his tastes were kind of ghetto. </p>

<p>Great post especially the last part about Tut&rsquo;s taste. Hilarious!! I wonder what the translation of &#8220;Nome sain?&#8221; was in ancient Egyptian!</p>

		<p>First, let me address the description of David Patterson in #17.  The NY guv, like the majority of American blacks, obviously has Caucasian genes.  In his case, it looks like many.<br>
As to the racial makeup of the ancient Egyptians, it doesn&rsquo;t matter to Afrocentrics what discoveries are made.  Part of their philosophy is that whites somehow stole credit for their many great achievements and drove them into their present state.  In the magical thinking of those with IQ&rsquo;s of 70 and less, it&rsquo;s apparently easy to accept that the ancient ones could even fly, so what isn&rsquo;t possible in their worldview?  Any newspaper, magazine, or TV documentary that dares to tell the truth will be open to charges of racism, and heads might roll.  Few will risk losing their job and being blacklisted (pun acknowledged) from the business.  </p>

		<p>While Asians, Whites and Hispanics can hear a slur about themselves and realize the context of it and not get upset, blacks will throw a hissy fit.</p>

<p>I tend to disagree with that statement. Asians and &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; (which they are NOT) ALWAYS get upset about any slur hurled towards them. Too bad that Whites don&rsquo;t! This is all about SURVIVAL of OUR race and today&rsquo;s Whites don&rsquo;t seem to have what it takes to get &#8220;offended&#8221;. BTW, I most certainly DO get offended.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s puzzling  all  this excitement  about  Tut&rsquo;s  DNA.  There are  several  representations  of  Tut&rsquo;s  physiognomy, including  that  well-known  golden mask.  We  see  a  young somewhat  prognathous face,  with  &#8220;thick  lips&#8221;(as  Europeans  would say). The  nose is  small and  fits  well  into  the African range.  Unlike  the  European  nose  that  tends  to  be  relatively  large  and  projects  upwards vertically.  The  busts  of  Tut  also  portray  what  might  have  been  is  real-life  pigmentation: mahogony brown.</p>
<p>Re  the  DNA  stuff: well, R1 is  found  in Africa  &mdash;  especially  in  the  Cameroon ,  just  as  E3b though  found  all  over  Africa is  also  found  in Europe  with  Greece  carrying some  25%.</p>
<p>Another  indicator  of what the  Ancient  Egyptians were  in terms  of ethnicity  is  the eye witness  testimonies  of  the  Greeks  who actually  saw  the  Egyptians.  Herodotus, for example, always  of the  Egyptians  and  Nubians as  being  of the same  physiognomy, hair  type  and  color.  In fact, he even  used  the term &#8220;black&#8221; and  &#8220;woolly&#8221;  to describe  their  color and  hair respectively.  It&rsquo;s  all  there  is  Herodotus&rsquo;s  History.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s mainly the Celtic fringe. So King Tut was a Celt!&#8221;</p>
<p>Within ancient Europe and Egypt for that matter, tin for the making of bronze was obtained primarily [?] from Cornwall. There was a brisk trade in the order to make bronze implements.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Celtic people entered into the area until sometime later than Tut. It is interesting too that the oldest building in the world, located NewGrange Ireland, predates the pyramids. A building astronomically aligned and having amazing acoustic properties.</p>

		<p>R1b1a is the Afro-branch and is represented at app 50% among Egyptians &amp; 25% among Sub-Saharans, diverging from its Euro-branch in prehistory, so there would have been Paleolithic &amp; Mesolithic exogamy before the Sahara desertified, meaning that the landowners/priests were fully mixed when they founded the Old Kingdom but it doesnt mean they LOOKED/ACTED like modern SubSaharans when exogamy took place bc the branch split from the Euro-branch in the Middle East. R1b Blacks descend from Caucasians.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll concur that Tut and most other Egyptians were brown-skinned African Caucasians.  Of course, the all-knowing History channel used black actors in a recent show on Egypt which I happened upon while channel surfing.  Not to worry, folks, this is one more instance where the facts won&rsquo;t get in the way of black power and white guilt.  Remember, once black (political seat, historical figure, whatever) always black.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s so much PROOF that whites inundated the Mediterranean area, beginning about 5000 B.C., that it would be odd if white Caucasoids weren&rsquo;t depicted in drawings, statues, etc. in early civilizations.</p>
<p>Too, a Caucasian is a Caucasian even if his skin might be permanently tanned.  Various shades of Caucasians will reveal, upon examination of the body and skeletal structure after death, they are one family with the same genes and DNA.</p>
<p>That anybody would even remotely consider that our ancient ancestors were black is pure, unadulterated nonsense.</p>

<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t think most Egyptians would have a problem with this at all. Middle Easterners in general realize they are 80-95% Caucasian, of course some believe they are 100% Caucasian. They know there is more mixed blood now but they don&rsquo;t look at the Aryan leaders of the past as being separate/foreign invaders, they see them as their ancestors (which is accurate).</p>

		<p>Written by Czech Guy  &mdash;  &#8220;I think it is a useless sensation. The haplogroup predictor gives nothing more concrete than &ldquo;R1b&rdquo;, which is an ambiguous finding, because there also exists an African branch of R1b. Hence I would bet that it will be the African R1b, neither the Western European nor the Anatolian lineage of R1b.&#8221;</p>
<p>Czech Guy, you&rsquo;re incorrect on that:  <a href="https://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v18/n7/abs/ejhg2009231a.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v18/n7/abs/ejhg2009231a.html</a></p>
<p>This shows that this DNA came from Western Europe and somehow migrated to Western Africa. R1b is Western European, and has traveled east, into Egypt and somehow into West Africa. <br>

		<p>African tribes captured other African tribes,and used them as slaves-sold them to the moslems in more modern times(Might still do this)I beleive that most if not all advanced genetics came from somewhere in the Asian temperate/sub tropical zone.The Celts are definitly asian in my book-Persians are whiteas white (real ones)-unless they are decendants of the millions of white women taken as slaves,and concubines..The Mongols had a habit of doing this,as well as the ancient Chinese royalty-sending for wives from Persia..</p>

Everyone commenting on this topic needs to contact the National Geographic Genographic project and have your DNA tested to find you maternal and paternal lines. </p>
<p>It cost about 125. for each and you find you clades and subclades dating about 70k to 30k as the time frame stands now. </p>
<p>Very good explanation and information while you find out about your deep ancestral lineage roots, before there were names and literate records.</p>

<p>You are absolutely right.<br>
There are many discussions on youtube about the race of ancient Egypt and the Egypt people are really hating it if blacks say they were black. They all see themselves as whites or Arabs, but never as black, no matter how dark they are.<br>

<p>Yes, but Herodotus went there and described what he saw after the fall of white Egypt and after much mixing had taken place.</p>

		<p>According to the out of Africa theory, which has become the informed consensus, modern humans evolved in Africa over 100,000 years ago.  About 65,000 years ago, several hundred to about 1,500 of them crossed the Sinai Peninsula.  Everyone who is not an African black is descended from them.<br>
 <br>
Caucasians evolved on the other side of the Sinai Peninsula. About 10,000 years ago Caucasians developed agriculture in the fertile crescent.  What seems to have happened is that expanding farming populations moved west across the Sinai Peninsula, and settled all of North Africa.  The Sarah Desert served as a barrier between black and white populations.  <br>

		<p>&#8220;I agree with one of the above posts. R1b paternal ancestry (without any knowledge of its subclade) is rather ambiguous. The forensic reconstructions from his skull models, as well as artistic renderings during his lifetime, point to a North African Caucasoid. I should remind everyone that the Governor of NY state, David Patterson, has R1b haplogroup of the English variety, and who among us would classify him as White?. My bet is that Tut&rsquo;s R1b is the Anatolian type, likely derived from the Hittites who had extensive contacts with the Egyptians from the late 2nd millenium BCE onwards. We need mtDNA as well as some autosomal data on Tut before we call him 100% White.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Hittites were Indo-European. Your hypothesis isn&rsquo;t antagonistic to anything this article is saying.</p>
