<h1>$500K Donated to Ariz. to Defend Law</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Davenport, Google News, July 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Retirees and other residents from all over the country were among those who donated nearly $500,000 to help Arizona defend its immigration enforcement law, with most chipping in $100 or less, according to an analysis of documents obtained Thusday by The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The donations, 88 percent of which came from through the defense fund&rsquo;s website, surged this week after the federal government sued Tuesday to challenge the law. A document from Gov. Jan Brewer&rsquo;s office showed that 7,008 of the 9,057 online contributions submitted by Thursday morning were made in the days following the government&rsquo;s filing.</p>
<p>Website contributions came from all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and nearly 2,000 came from within Arizona. Donations ranged from $5 to $2,000, with the vast majority between $10 and $100.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Donors contacted by the AP said they contributed because the federal government should be helping Arizona, not taking the state to court.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arizona needs our help,&#8221; said Mary Ann Rohde, a retired municipal worker who lives in Rialto, Calif., who donated $20 with her husband. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a disgrace what our government is doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Howard E. Sanner, of Houston, said Arizona&rsquo;s approval of its law should help prod the federal government to act on border security to help prevent criminals and terrorists from entering the country illegally.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s just a mess that has to be straightened out,&#8221; said Sanner, a retired clothing and linen salesman who said he supports legal immigration and donated $5 to the fund.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brewer established the Governor&rsquo;s Border Security and Immigration Legal Defense Fund with an executive order on May 26. Her office said the state had received about $10,000 in unsolicited donations from people in dozens of states by then.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Citing the crush of filings in the case, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton has imposed limits on the size of so-called &#8220;friend of the court&#8221; briefs filed by groups in support or opposition to the law.</p>
<p>Brewer hired the private lawyers to represent the state even before the Democratic attorney general, Terry Goddard, agreed to Brewer&rsquo;s demand to withdraw from the state&rsquo;s defense. {snip}</p>

		<p>234 years ago, our ancestors risked their fortunes and lives in what was then seen to be an impossible, foolish, and hopeless attempt to create a government that was FOR THEM and not for some foreign, elitist power.  Few thought that it could be done, and most believed that these patriots would soon be killed   &mdash;   their families and homes destroyed.  </p>
<p>I am of course talking about the Declaration of Independence and the American Revolutionary War.  These incredibly brave and selfless men and women risked everything they had to throw off the tyranny of a government that placed the welfare of foreigners (the British) over that of the people (the Colonists).  </p>
<p>Today, America is faced with a similar crisis   &mdash;   an attempt to ethnically clense European people from North America and replace them with Third-World rabble.  </p>
<p>The current crisis is in some ways even more urgent and dangerous than the situation in 1776.  However, unlike our forfathers who risked everything, all YOU need do is contribute a few hundred Dollars to the cause. If you love America, If you want a safe and livable future for your children and grandchildren, I plead with you to contribute to Arizona, and the other brave patriots and organizations that are attempting to wrest our Nation back from the Socialist-multicultural hordes.  Donate today and donate tomorrow, whenever and whatever you can.</p>
<p>God Save America!  Don&rsquo;t Tread on Me! </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Donors contacted by the AP said they contributed because the federal government should be helping Arizona, not taking the state to court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interestingly, we are seeing a groundswell of popular (and mostly white) discontent against our &ldquo;Dear Leader&rdquo; and the federal &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; monstrosity that he is the primary executive of. This Arizona issue, with so many other states falling like dominos all over themselves, to attempt to imitate its &ldquo;controversial&rdquo; law; the New Black Panther Party/DOJ debacle; and to a lesser extent, the recent NASA socialist workers&rsquo; policy of inspiring Islam toward self-actualization in the sciences and technology, have all become reflections of just how audaciously dogmatic and hopelessly estranged this arrogant fool and his Marxist party of bandits and bigots are, from the people they were elected to &ldquo;serve and protect.&rdquo; Even the Kagan nomination and her childish evasions in the face of the Senate Judiciary Committee&rsquo;s questions, oozes of the swaggering contempt these Reds feel for the majority of this country.</p>
<p>I think &ldquo;Dear Leader&rdquo; and his Comrades are going to be in for a very harsh trip to the woodshed in November, and here my optimism peeks. Indeed it will good for a laugh to see this mulatto humiliated; however, here is also where my cynicism kicks in. Following this electoral evisceration of &ldquo;hope and change,&rdquo; will the Republicans finally be able to overcome their craven political lusts and racial perversions? Will they see, that redistributive multiculturalism unleashed is what has given them their victory, only because the white majority wishes for them to obstruct, or even destroy it? </p>
<p>Here, I have my doubts; as always, God help us all!</p>

<p>Do everything you can to make YOUR STATE pass a similar law.</p>
<p>Eventually, there will be a handful of &#8220;brown&#8221; states that remain sanctuaries for illegal mestizos.  They will all crumble in a similar fashion to California.</p>

		<p> Good for these Americans who want to help a sovereign state that is being bullied by our misguided federal government! I&rsquo;ll be sending a donation as soon as I finish this comment. May that $500,000 turn into several million, or whatever it takes to stop the Obamaites in theit tracks.</p>
<p> By the way, kudos to whoever came up with the idea for the &#8220;Arizona: Doing the job the feds won&rsquo;t do!&#8221; logo. For those of you who may be too young to remember, it appears to be based on the &#8220;Rosie the Riveter&#8221; posters from World War II. </p>

		<p>This is very good news because right now it appears one of the greatest threats to this great nation of ours is our own federal government and the blame is clearly on both the democrats and republicans. Obama inherited this nightmare from Bush but he is just as bad for his failure to act on this threat immediately and with conviction. There are simple solutions to much of this problem, far easier than building The Great Wall of the United States and that is to imprison any person who employs or rents housing to an illegal. Sanctuary cities like New Haven CT should be cut off from all federal assistance as well. If some simple common sense measures like this were enacted along with enforcing the laws already on the books this problem would soon disappear.</p>

		<p>6 Robert:</p>
<p>Someone asked Press Secretary Robert Gibbs about why doesn&rsquo;t the DOJ go after sanctuary cities.  For it is they, after all, that are, by definition, engaging in the crime of obstruction of justice on a Federal level by ordering by city ordinance that city cops/etc. not pass information about Federal crimes being committed in the city (the presence of illegal aliens) to Federal law enforcement.  Gibbs basically said, &#8220;Idunno.&#8221;  Of course he knows, it&rsquo;s because the illegals vote Democrat, and they&rsquo;re cheap labor to the plutocrat industries that fund Bush and so many open borders Republicans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it on this medium before, and I&rsquo;m sure some of you are sick of me saying it so many times, but it&rsquo;s that important:  If a city in Mississippi, say 60% white 40% black in population, had a city council that passed a law prohibiting its cops and city bureaucrats from passing information about white-on-black civil rights violations to the FBI Civil Rights section, or prohibited them from cooperating in FBI investigations or state investigations of the same, the FBI would have rode into town mere hours after the passage of the ordinance, and arrested the city council members who voted for it, and the U.S. Attorneys would have drawn up charges of obstruction already. </p>

		<p>The question everyone should be asking is why hasn&rsquo;t the republican party come out strongly against non-white criminals in general and ethnic cleansing and invasion, specifically?  </p>
<p>Such a thing would permanently entrench them in power.  Many republicans are being replaced by people who hold these views.</p>
<p>Republican victory, at this point, is a foregone conclusion, for the next two elections.  The real battle is for what that will mean.</p>
<p>Will the republicans change their schizophrenic stance on the issue, after November to one that organizes white resistance on a federal level&hellip;..or will the states basically seize power by handling this issue themselves.</p>
<p>That conflict is taking place right before our eyes, RIGHT NOW.  But it will heat up as we near the election.  And will boil over between the midterm and next Presidential election.</p>

<p>No, it is NOT!   Don&rsquo;t be silly!  Never make such an assumption.  I always say, never assume anything and don&rsquo;t take ANYTHING for granted.</p>
<p>Taking things for granted is the worst mistake anyone can make.  That is what has gotten us into the spot where we are now.</p>

I think you&rsquo;re both kidding yourselves.  It may be for the absolute best that -no one- achieve dominant power bloc voting preferences in the Federal Legislature.</p>
<p>That we may then -force- these people to show their true nature (leash holders anyway) as the States retake sovereign initiative, form common defensive coallition polcies and wrest loose those powers now centrist-controlled by Federal mandate.</p>
<p>In the latter case, also exploiting the mockery that the Federal level government has made of the Constitution.</p>
<p>So long as they rip and tear at each other; our national Congressional and Executive branches are helpless in the face of what amounts to a quiet secession.  Even as they are obvious in being utterly childish and self-fixated on their inner-circle politics as a game for it&rsquo;s own sake of playing.</p>
<p>As soon as they start to react to being effectively ignored as the writers of national policy, it is -still- better that they be fragmented than truly &#8216;bipartisan&rsquo; or &#8216;dominant party&rsquo; unified in any attempt to legislate themselves back into dominance.</p>
<p>What will matter in the next 10-20 years is how long it takes the state and local governments to become fully as enmeshed in corporate/special interest ownership and corruption as the national level is and whether some kind of alliances can be made without destroying our last redoubt of ethnic sanctuary.</p>
<p>Clearly, California has already gone beyond the tipping point.  But it may just be that, based on residual racial and class established demography, the obvious costs of supporting a massive underclass and general &#8216;likemindedness&rsquo; among pragmatic corporate ownerships, that other States don&rsquo;t need to go down that road.</p>
<p>Or it could be we all get flipped by multinational influences as whatever is left of our 5th Estate (U.S. wealthbase) is itself too fragmented or porous to the influences of the G8 and globalist community.</p>

		<p>The Constititution DOES NOT prohibit the states from regulating immigration or even naturalization.</p>
<p>Facts that nobody seems to bring up, but should to use in Arizona&rsquo;s defense of it state sovereignty. </p>
<p>1. In no place in the constitution does Congress (i.e. Federal Gov&rsquo;t) have exclusive control over naturalization and immigration.  Congress does have the power in Article I, Section VIIII, Clause 4, to &#8220;establish a uniform rule of naturalization,&#8221; but this power is not denied to the states in Article I, Section X. As a result the 10th Amendment then gives the states the power to regulate foreign immigration and naturalization.</p>
<p>2. Up until the 1890s the states actually regulated foreign immigration. Entry ports like Castle Garden in New York were actually regulated by the state of NY and not the federal gov&rsquo;t.  States could and did deny entry to foreigners.</p>
<p>3. Also, the Constitution only protects citizens moving from one state to another found in article IIII, Section II, Clauses 1. However, the constitution clearly does not afford non-citizens the same protections.  A state can actually forbid non-citizens from entering their state. Before the Civil War several states actually prohibited certain non-citizens residency.  </p>
<p>The federal government has already ceded this power in fact because it has allowed several cities to establish sanctuary provisions or non-enforcement of federal immigration law.  Under what justification then could states be prohibited from enforcinng the federal immigration law.  The power has already been given up by the federal governmnent.</p>
<p>Of couse the fedral government will claim federal law is supreme, but that is a matter for debate and has been since Madison and Jefferson stated that the states have the power to check the power of the federal governmennt through nullification. </p>
<p>Is the federal govrnment willing to wage war on Arizona if the people of Arizona decide to nullify federal immigration laws? </p>

		<p>Just sent $100.  Big believer in states rights.  Further poll after poll, not the least being the left leaning Pew Research group, consistently find that 70-75% of the nation agree with Arizona.  BTW if 5% of our population is illegal, then you can gross the poll numbers up by that amount.  These are very polarized numbers.  Yet the Feds are not helping and are dumb to the popular sentiment.  Independent of the legal argument one would hope the Feds would protect the borders.  And if the Feds aren&rsquo;t going to enforce the law themselves, let the states assist.  Seems reasonable.  <br>
As for racial bias, I am so confused (or not).  Our southern border, I have been told is the only border in the world where a developed nation and a third world nation abut.  As for race, the US census was adamant that Hispanic is not a race when it collected its data.  And as to profiling, as another AMREN contributor said &#8220;if 6&rsquo; tall, slender blonde women were coming over the border in droves, the cops would be wise to look for 6&rsquo; tall, slender blonde women.&#8221;  And I would likely help in that aesthetic endeavor.<br>

		<p>For anyone that thinks we live in a free country where the will of the people means anything I say think again. </p>
<p>Americans didn&rsquo;t want to get involved in world war one and even elected a president based on the fact that he promised to keep us out of foreign wars. We were tricked into getting into world war two, lied to about Korea and conned into Vietnam. </p>
<p>The leaders of this country know how average Americans feel about illegal immigration and it&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t mean a hill of beans. </p>
<p>By voting all you get is a choice of which party gets to screw you. </p>
<p>Every time I hear one of our leaders going on about democracy I wonder when they plan to bring some to America. </p>
<p>The Arizona Law is probably the most popular piece of legislation since the Bill of Rights. </p>

<p>Somebody&rsquo;s gotta say it! (and so you did).  Repeat as necessary, Tell Everyone You Care About and Don&rsquo;t Ever Let Down Your Guard!</p>
<p>The lefties that have infiltrated this country and its institutions and hijacked our government, never never never ever give up  &mdash;  they persevere, re-double their efforts and scream louder than ever when they&rsquo;re down or losing.  They scare wealthy donors with staged pictures of Nazi rallies claiming this is what they&rsquo;re fighting and but for them (SPLC, ADL) the Nazis would be in power.  And it works.<br>
They have no qualms about shutting down, with threats of violence and intimidation, AmRen conferences, speeches by Tom Tancredo and others who don&rsquo;t toe the current PC Reign of Terror.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll subvert the truth and &#8220;clothe lies with moral garments&#8221; to achieve what their guru alinsky called for:</p>
<p>&#8221;..A new social order of the dictatorship of the proletariat   &mdash;   the political paradise of communism&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alinsky&rsquo;s eighth rule: Keep the pressure on.</p>
<p> Wrote Alinsky:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Radicals precipitate the social crisis by action   &mdash;   radicals become fighting mad and go into action&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And, most importantly:</p>
<p>&#8221;..radicals give themselves to the cause; [they] give and take the hard, dirty, bitter way of life&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what we&rsquo;re up against, what has taken over subverted our government and institutions.</p>
<p>And it is evil.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Alinsky is the founder of the modern American Left as well as the community organizer movement of which BHO and ACORN are a product.  Hilary Clinton, wrote her thesis at Wellesly College on Alinsky. The radical left socialists who control the Democrat Party all studied Alinsky and his methods. The person who currently occupies the White House was a community organizer who also studied Alinsky&rsquo;s methods&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>It is 100% imperative to understand their tactics in order to counteract and defeat them, if it&rsquo;s at all possible  &mdash;  no less than the future of the US is at stake.</p>
