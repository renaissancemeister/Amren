			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peroshni Govender, Reuters, July 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Almost as soon as Spain defeated the Netherlands in Sunday&rsquo;s World Cup final, concerns flared about a relapse into attacks on migrants from neighbouring states competing for scarce jobs.</p>
<p>Police shifted from protecting foreign visitors at soccer stadiums to patrolling impoverished townships where migrants have lived as officials vowed no repeat of the violence two years ago that killed 62 and left more than 100,000 homeless.</p>
<p>But many migrants fear a rapid dissipation of feelings of African unity generated by the first World Cup ever held on the continent, stilling South African accusations that foreigners were stealing jobs at a time of 25 percent unemployment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s liberal immigration policies have led to millions of Africans flocking to its borders where prospects for work as unskilled labour in the continent&rsquo;s biggest economy, albeit few, are far better than what they can find at home.</p>
<p>Government officials have said the fear is real, but the threats of mass violence are based on hyped-up rumours.</p>
<p>HYPE OR WELL-GROUNDED FEAR?</p>
<p>Zuma&rsquo;s government has accused the media of generating hype about a possible flare-up of race-related violence and said the threats were the work of criminals.</p>
<p>But the International Organisation for Migration reported this week Zimbabwean families were fleeing.</p>
<p>Local reports have said foreigners were leaving on buses while one migrant from Somalia told Reuters he was seeking refuge in a densely populated suburb after his store in a township was burned down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was told every foreigner should go back home,&#8221; said Khadar Bashir, a 24-year-old Somali trader.</p>
<p>One of the difficulties in classifying the motive for attacks on migrants is the country&rsquo;s alarmingly high crime rates. The poor from South Africa and abroad fall victim to violence daily in the state where murders average 50 per day.</p>

		<p>So, wait a minute.</p>
<p>This is rainbow-nation today. Who was right? The do-betters and liberals who said South Africa will keep wealthy and safe and all people of all colors will peacefully live together?</p>
<p>Or the &#8220;nazi-apartheid-regime&#8221; who said that people of different ethnics will not live together and South Africa will get poor and dangerous just like the rest of Africa?</p>
<p>I am still searching the video on youtube I saw some months ago. It was a report maybe of the BBC on Zimbabwe when Robert Mugabe came to power few decades ago. At the end of the Report the BBC-reporter said: &#8220;Some white conservatives here were scared and feared to be killed and driven off when black people get the power. But now we can say that this was wrong. Black people got on power but want to live in peace with whites.&#8221; The guy who uploaded the video of course did it so we can see how wrong the illusionist the view of liberals were. Today we can just come to the ending that the reporter was completely wrong.<br>
In Zimbabwe, in South Africa, and in France everything developed exactly the way right-wing people and conservatives always said it will develop. </p>
<p><b>The only place where this can not happen is the United States because only there white people have a right to carry guns and defend themselves.</b> Please Americans don&rsquo;t let the government take your guns away. This way you could go down to, but it will not be a silent lose like in South Africa. If the USA go down by race wars, at least it will be so loud and bloody that it will wake up the rest of the world.</p>

		<p>A few random thoughts around the Soccer World Cup :</p>
<p>The vast majority of whites were totally indifferent to the whole spectacle.</p>
<p>Both the government and FIFA basically banned the local press from any negative reporting or covering the white genocide. It is claimed that there was a huge drop in crime during the WC - mostly because the criminals (many of whom are members of the police force) were watching football, and because the white population were extremely alert during this period, knowing that the cops were told to protect foreigners and tourists as a matter of priority.</p>
<p>The WC is to stand as proof of &#8220;African&#8221; success. This while the circus will be paid for by mostly white tax payers, white rugby stadiums were utilised ( and to serve as white elephants in future), the entire infrastructure built by whites etc etc. To the blacks it was all about looking good in the eyes of the world - and the MSM did everything in their power to assist in pushing that agenda.</p>

<p>Make an ad for keeping the US for Americans. Feature Bashir. Liberal Icon South Africa: bastion of racial and national integrity. Now, after the Africans yearning for continental integrity are dumped into the Kalahari Desert and told to walk North, the Bantus can follow, the Zulus and whites can divide tortured South Africa.</p>
<p>SA Indians can be sent back to their high-tech origins paradise to answer phones for US iphone computer capitalists. </p>
<p>I now see the problem the ignorant migrant morons of the world have. No one taught them to draw lines on a piece of paper. In other words, they can&rsquo;t read maps, they don&rsquo;t know what a border is, and why there have been borders for 5,000 years.</p>

		<p>This is profoundly disturbing.  Here South Africa, under black governance, seems to be disintegrating.  This is nearly without precedent.  Why, just think of Haiti, Zimbabwe, Jamaica, Watts, Cleveland, Detroit, St. Louis, Newark, Gary, Youngstown, and all other examples of national and urban racial harmony, low crime rates, high employment, and neatly maintained homes and work-places.  </p>
<p>We have to conduct a thorough search for the root causes of this strange and anomalous situation in South Africa.</p>

		<p>The only men who know that Communism would lead to the disintegration of South Africa are generally the ones who implemented it and those who accepted it and are now poor.<br>
The effects of communism in South Africa are staggering and have the effect of blinding the indoctrinated beyond reason.<br>
Recently, I tried to help a South African shelter for abused kids.<br>
But after speaking with a female dutch christian pastor who begged and thanked me for my generosity, I was shorlty thereafter treated to racial condescention veiled in religion typical of some black nationalists.<br>
Sometimes the most efficient way to cure a communist is to allow them to starve.<br>
I fully support the starvation of communist nations in order to bring about freedom.</p>

		<p>The sole cause for the attacks on foreigners are unemployment. It is said to be at 40-50% but is more likely to be a staggering 60%+. As a South African, let me tell you why:<br>
The ANC is hellbent on promoting transformation, which is another word for revolution these days. They want to take every white man out of his own business or every farmer off his land and replace them with a black man, who does not have the knowledge, skill or will to do the job. The result is the company/farm goes into disarray and people lose their jobs. This is a know fact which is especially true on the farms. In just one region, a farming community of 30000 ha was handed over to blacks. Only a few years later, the farm was non-existent and more than 3000 workers lost their jobs and livelihood. Again, the white man will be blamed for this. </p>
<p>This is how it is in the whole of Africa and the world stares itself blind against what is actually going on and keeps on funding them.    </p>
