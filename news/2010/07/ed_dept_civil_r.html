<h1>Ed Dept, Civil Rights Leaders Discuss Reform</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christine Armario and Dorie Turner, Google News, July 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Civil rights leaders are criticizing Obama administration education reforms aimed at turning around low performing schools and closing the achievement gap for minority students.</p>
<p>Eight civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, contend in a document released Monday the Education Department is promoting ineffective approaches for failing schools. They also claim the $4.35 billion &#8220;Race to the Top&#8221; grant competition  &mdash;  a program with a goal of spurring innovative reform in states  &mdash;  leaves out many minority students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Education Secretary Arne Duncan and a White House adviser met with the groups Monday, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Rev. Al Sharpton and the presidents of the National Urban League and NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. The groups distributed the document to members of Congress last week.</p>
<p>Duncan has called education &#8220;the civil rights issue of our generation,&#8221; and many of the reforms the administration has pushed aim to improve educational opportunities for the most vulnerable students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Obama administration&rsquo;s education reforms have drawn criticism from education advocates, including prominent teachers&rsquo; unions like the American Federation of Teachers, which gives money to many of the groups that signed the civil rights document. AFT President Randi Weingarten said she supports the proposal but that her organization had nothing to do with writing it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The proposal calls into question many of the Education Department&rsquo;s initiatives, including the $4.35 billion Race to the Top competition and the $3.5 billion to turn around low performing schools.</p>
<p>Citing federal data, the groups say just 3 percent of the nation&rsquo;s black students and less than 1 percent of Latino students are impacted by the first round of the Race to the Top competition, which awarded about $600 million for Tennessee and Delaware to undertake innovative reforms. Finalists for the second round of grants are to be announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The document also proposes creating standards for equal access to early childhood education, effective teachers, college preparatory curriculum and quality resources. And it takes a critical viewpoint of the administration&rsquo;s approach to turn around failing schools, including closing them or replacing much of the staff.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the plan has one glaring omission: no Hispanic groups signed on to support it.</p>
<p>Raul Gonzalez from the National Council of La Raza said his organization decided not to endorse the document because there were concerns with how the groups see charter schools. The civil rights groups want charter schools to focus more on attracting diversity than the needs of the children in their community, Gonzalez said.</p>

		<p>Well, we here in N.J. already know the answer isn&rsquo;t money. We&rsquo;ve got the &#8220;Abbott&#8221; Schools here and minority children have been recieving extremely hign percentages of tax dollars in their districts for years now, court ordered of course. Then there&rsquo;s the point that their not doing any better than they were before all this tax money was poured down the drain. </p>

		<p>I wonder when they will introduce seperate academic examinations for blacks, whites &amp; Hispanics.<br>
This way the academic disparity could be overcome &amp; whites can then be said to be in the lower academic ratings in the country.</p>

		<p>It seems to me that, after just changing a few names and the date, you could have written this article 5 years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, 40 years ago.</p>
<p>If any of these proposals were going to work, at least in their purported goals, wouldn&rsquo;t they have worked by now?</p>
<p>It is my opinion that there is no such thing as a failing school, and there are, properly understood, very few bad teachers.  There are really only inadequate students.  They say the goal is a quality teacher for every room full of students?  I think it should be the other way around:  A room full of quality students for every teacher.</p>

		<p>I believe all these efforts really are helping to close the gap. Enough money and &#8216;effort&rsquo; can close the gap. What always seems to be overlooked (and we wont attribute it to malevolence here)are the simple ideas of those such as Abraham Lincoln. He said all students should be allowed to live up to their full potential, whatever it might be. </p>

<p>I would imagine that listening in on this &#8220;meeting&#8221; would&rsquo;ve been like watching a comedy show. Hey guys, next time why don&rsquo;t you just go ahead and invite the new black panthers to the meeting. If I were a Congressman, that &#8220;document&#8221; would&rsquo;ve been in the garbage can the moment it hit my desk.</p>
<p> &#8220;The administration is dedicated to equity in education and we&rsquo;ve been working very closely with the civil rights community to develop the most effective policies to close the achievement gap - </p>
<p>How can they close the achievement gap if they include people who have never achieved anything on their own. You can either include the &#8220;civil rights community&#8221; or you can close the achievement gap - you can&rsquo;t do both. </p>

		<p>&#8220;They think money will close the racial achievement gap.&#8221;</p>
<p>The racial achievement gap is everywhere blacks live with other races, whether it is whites, Hispanics, Middle Easterners, Asians, Pacific Islanders, etc.  In every country, competing with ALL the races therein, blacks are behind. </p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t been possible to narrow the achievement gap anywhere in the world due to lack of black intelligence.  What has money got to do with it?</p>

		<p>NEWSFLASH:  There are no &#8220;low performing schools.&#8221; There are low performing black and brown students in schools. White and Asian kids do fine there, though whenever possible parents will send them elsewhere to escape the disruptions and outright life-threatening dangers of being around low performing blacks and browns.</p>

		<p>There are two keys points in this article.  First, La Raza refused to endorse the report because there was little focus on &#8220;the needs of the children in their community.&#8221;  Latinos want the education to focus on Spanish language and Latino history.  Many schools in Houston, Denver, Chicago, Atlanta etc. have been flooded with Latino children in the last 15 years and the entire curriculum has been changed to focus on Latino wants.  Second, for at least 50 years more money has been spent on schooling black children than any other racial group in America.  Money is not going to change the achievement gap.</p>

		<p>I often wonder how long we can dodge the truth about black academic performance. The problem is always defined as lack of funding, even when this &#8220;root cause&#8221; is exposed as, if anything, over-funding.</p>
<p>Effectively, we&rsquo;ve been denying for perhaps one hundred years that black failure has anything to do with average levels of black intelligence and temperament.  And this is a truth which literally everybody, from your most unreconstructed redneck to your most starry-eyed liberal, knows.  It&rsquo;s truly an extraordinary falsehood that survives universal knowledge to the contrary, the sustenance of which requires hundreds of billions of dollars confiscated from the ordinary citizens of this country. It also requires the endless fabrication of new and increasingly inventive lies to explain the endless failures of these remedial actions to re-make the black African race.</p>
<p>Obviously, it will have to end at some point, either when we reach a point of bankruptcy that precludes further subsidization of black Africans or when we end up being subjugated by a foreign power (most likely China) which doesn&rsquo;t share our compulsive need to accommodate and subsidize blacks.</p>

		<p>Here is my solution for inner city education. It is expensive, but it would work. Set up boarding schools where kids can stay, outside of the dysfunction. Only students who make the grade can stay there. Children who become behavior problems or slackers are booted to the conventional public schools. This will give the exceptional and resilient children of the inner city the opportunity to succeed outside of their dysfunctional environments.</p>

		<p>All these experts will continue to ignore the established fact that &#8220;g&#8221; is highly heritable and that blacks and hispanics are significantly &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; by age four because of their extraordinarily stunted vocabulary and interpersonal skills.  It used to be said that &#8220;beauty is fleeting; dumb is forever.&#8221;  The newest corollary is &#8220;normal childhood is fleeting; the latest ed school hypocrisy is forever.&#8221;  Homeschool or private school: where your money is your heart is also - treasure your children, not your treasure.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity: <br>
Thank you. The St. Louis KIPP Program sounds much like I am suggesting.<br>
The article is critical because of the expense, but my response would be how expensive are the prisons, the welfare, the crime? We would win out if we would do more of this.  But I would not call them orphanages, I would call them Boarding Schools. I think it would work.</p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re making a faulty assumption that if not for KIPP and other similar schools, its students would have necessarily become violent prison-dwelling criminals and welfare dependents.  I tend to think KIPPers do better than the black average because they have better than black average IQs and other personality traits.  </p>
<p>Let me turn your question right back on you.  Are we to spend all this money to bring somewhat above average black middle school students close to the white average instead of spending it to make elite white students even better?</p>
