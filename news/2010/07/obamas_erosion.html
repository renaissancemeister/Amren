			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Cillizza, Washington Post, July 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Just 40 percent of whites in the Post/ABC survey approve of the job Obama is doing, his lowest rating among this key demographic since the start of his presidency and well below the 50 percent approval number that he carries nationwide. Forty-three percent of white voters strongly disapprove of the job Obama is doing, while just 19 percent strongly approve.</p>
<p>Among the other lowlights with whites in this poll for Obama: 54 percent of college-educated whites now disapprove of the job he is doing, and, among white college-educated women, Obama&rsquo;s approval numbers has dipped below 50 percent for the first time in his presidency in Post/ABC polling.</p>
<p>Much of Obama&rsquo;s struggles with white voters seems directly attributable to the public&rsquo;s deep pessimism about the economy. {snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that Obama&rsquo;s flagging numbers on the economy have been driven not by white Republicans or white Independents but rather by white Democrats.</p>
<p>Since April, white Democratic approval of Obama&rsquo;s handling of the economy is down 20 points, from 80 percent to 60 percent. And, nearly as many white Democrats now strongly disapprove of how he&rsquo;s dealing with the issue as those who strongly approve (25 strongly disapprove; 28 strongly approve).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What these numbers mean is that congressional Democrats need one of two things to happen to avoid major losses this fall: 1) Obama&rsquo;s numbers must rebound among white voters in some significant way or 2) The Democratic National Committee&rsquo;s plan to re-create elements of the 2008 electoral coalition must work, changing the face of the traditional midterm electoral in a meaningful manner.</p>

<p>Shortly after Obama was elected, someone I know said that he thought the new president would only serve one term in office. I was incredulous at first. But witnessing his approval rating decline among the most pivotal demographic group, the notion that Obama is only a one-term president is actually quite plausible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to believe that Obama&rsquo;s approval rating among European Americans won&rsquo;t continue to decline even further as time passes.</p>
<p>The key question, though, is this: will the GOP actually nominate an electable candidate instead of some one like John McCain, who is actually a knee-jerk liberal disguised as a Republican?</p>

		<p>I remember Slick Willie&rsquo;s first term. I could&rsquo;ve sworn that he would only be a one term president due to all of the Zoe Baird and Lani Guiner type scandals. </p>
<p>Instead, we got a lay-down-and-die candidate Bob Dole, and Clinton won in a landslide. When Bush II ran for President, he still barely won the first time against what should&rsquo;ve been a Reagan &#8216;84 type of victory.</p>
<p>Expect the GOP to believe their key to victory in 2012 is to reach out to more minorities, while dissing the Tea Party as racists. </p>
<p>Start running through your list of Dole/McCain like candidates. One of them is probably your sacrificial lamb for Obama&rsquo;s second term.</p>

<p>Here is the real conundrum for the Democrats in general, and &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; Comrade BO in particular: there are still not enough nonwhite voters in this country to cancel out the white vote, unless they get at a minimum 40 to 45 percent of the white vote in conjunction with overwhelming nonwhite backing and turnout. Whites might be only 65% of the country&rsquo;s total population, but we remain approximately 75% to potentially about 81% of the voters. This is because most whites see voting as a responsibility, not some orgy of entitlement and retribution. Hence, General Secretary BO&rsquo;s and his Congressional comrades&rsquo; recent plight. They can&rsquo;t win via platitudes only which they thrive on, or the &ldquo;promised&rdquo; instant solutions they claim to be able to make through them.</p>
<p>In 2010 and 2012, I believe that higher than expected white turnouts, along with significantly lowered minority participation, will see the Republicans firmly in power for about another 8 to 10 years. What they will do with that power, well God only knows. They prove time and again to be able to superficially grasp demographic and racial realities, only then to betray them on the multicultural alter of genocide and insanity once in power. While such a game does have short term benefits, the long term strategy is beyond stupid for them. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>He still gets a large % of white votes, in spite of his blatant anti-white stance he doesn&rsquo;t even try to hide. </p>
<p>When he runs for election, he&rsquo;ll move to the center again, and still capture a large % of white votes. Kind of like voting for Robert Mugabe or Stokely Carmichael. So many whites don&rsquo;t want to see what is right there in front of their faces. </p>

They BRAG that they have many &#8220;good blacks&#8221; in their movement but will not tolerate any WN!!!!! This tells me they are so full of it and will just continue the downward spiral of White America. They are NOT our friends.</p>

		<p>If either Sarah Palin or Newt Gingrich is the Republican nominee in 2012, I hate to say it, but Obama will be re-elected. Palin carries too much baggage as someone lacking in intellectual stature, and even the adult video industry is spoofing her. Gingrich, likewise, carries too much baggage - Democrats will bring up how the government was shut down for a few days, while he was Speaker, during Clinton&rsquo;s first term. Also, they&rsquo;ll paint him as someone heartless, seeing as how he divorced his second wife while she was undergoing treatment for cancer.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see Mitt Romney making another run, (&#8216;President Mitt Romney&#8221;?) and Bobby Jindal is a huge liability. Most Americans cannot tell the difference between an Indian and a Pakistani. They may think he&rsquo;s a Pakistani plant. </p>

		<p> What is not mentioned in this excellent analysis is that there was a fall-off in the number of White voters in 2008, as compared to 2006. That and the fact that blacks and other minorities turned out heavily, explains Obama&rsquo;s victory in the presidential race.</p>
<p> The key element among the statistics quoted here is the &#8220;Whites likely to vote&#8221; thumbs-down on Obama by 23 percentage points. It would take a major miracle, plus a competency transplant for Obama and his henchmen, to save the House for the Democrats this year. The Senate also is believed to be in play. That and the fact that 2006 and 2008 were big Democratic years   &mdash;   the GOP is due for a big win. I hope the Democrats who voted for Obama are happy now: Their man has managed to shoot himself in the foot, the hand, and between the eyes, all at the same time. Now that takes talent!</p>

The problem we face in the next presidential race is that we have to find a conservative candidate who has the personal integrity that can withstand scrutiny and who isn&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t be seen or portrayed as unbalanced (like McCain).</p>
<p>Find that guy and whites will have no problem voting for him. Whites found it easier to vote for Obama than McCain because McCain wasn&rsquo;t seen as winnable or stable.</p>
<p>Right now, they&rsquo;re pushing Sarah Palin. I don&rsquo;t know if she has what it takes but her image in the liberal media is so skewed, I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s electable. People can&rsquo;t differentiate between Palin and the parodies of her on Saturday Night Live and that&rsquo;s an insurmountable problem.</p>

<p>First, Clinton did not win by a landslide in 1996.  In fact, Clinton failed to win a majority of the vote in either 1992 or 1996.  More people did not want Bill Clinton as president than wanted him as president.  He won by pluralities both times.</p>
<p>Second, there is no comparison between Clinton and Obama.  Clinton was rational and a pragmatist.  Obama is irrational, incompetent, a radical and a complete failure.  After the Republicans took control of Congress in 1994, Clinton read the handwriting on the wall and went along, in good part, with the Republican agenda.  Among other things, Clinton enacted Republican welfare reform and Republican fiscal policy producing balanced budgets and surpluses.  He even signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law.  Divided government with Clinton worked and the US economy during the mid to late 1990s was one of the strongest.  Not so with Obama.</p>
<p>Despite a compliant media, I think people understand that Obama is an irrational radical whose policies seem to make sense only if the destruction of the United States is his ultimate goal.  Fortunately, like most liberals, he&rsquo;s also grossly incompetent and will be relegated to the dust bin of history in 2012.  The Democrats will likely be out of power in Congress by November 2010 as the American people try to put the brakes on Obama&rsquo;s out-of-control agenda.  Just vote Republican&hellip;there&rsquo;s really no other way to stop Obama.</p>

		<p>The most shocking thing here is the 40 percent of whites who still approve of Obama.</p>
<p>I think D.B Cooper is right about Obama surprising everyone and winning a second term, but wrong about the reason.  Sure having Bob Dole as an opponent was a big help to Clinton in &#8216;96, but ironically he owed it all to the Republicans and their Contract With America.</p>
<p>Clinton and both Bushes taught us a very important lesson.  When the economy is bad, people get impatient with incumbents.  Bush I learned this the hard way.  </p>
<p>However, Clinton and Bush II showed us that when the economy is booming Americans don&rsquo;t care who the president is and will stick with the incumbent, regardless of what that administration is up to.  Opposition to the wars and a MASSIVE media blitz failed to unseat GWB (and again a lame opposition candidate named John Frankenstein Kerry was a big help).  This was very near the peak of the economic cycle and people didn&rsquo;t want to ruin what they perceived as a good thing.</p>
<p>People HATED Clinton at first.  He wouldn&rsquo;t have won without blacks and Ross Perot.  He and his wife played a big role in the Republican sweep in &#8216;94 with their health care push and other shenanigans.  But then the Republican congress reeled Clinton in.  They forced him to curtail spending.  They forced him to agree to welfare reform.  Country grew.  And Slick Willie got all the credit.  </p>
<p>If he could have ran for a third term he would have smoked Bush II in 2000 even in light of all the Lewinsky stuff and what turned out to be a gross underestimation of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a replay of this scenario I fear the most.  A new Republican congress enacting pro-growth legislation that will improve economic conditions and for which the Obama machine will take credit for.  Remember a good portion of that 60 percent who disapprove of Obama are white-guilt types who are itching for a reason to get back on the bandwagon and start firing off their &#8220;I told you sos.&#8221;</p>

		<p>6 S.F.:</p>
<p>Main problem with Nut Gingrich IMHO is that he spearheaded South Africa&rsquo;s death warrant through the House in the early 1980s, and of course Reagan signed it.  </p>
<p>Sarah Palin&rsquo;s baggage is immigration   &mdash;   Until Arizona turned up the heat b/c of 1070, her immig record was horrible   &mdash;   Came out for a Matricula Mickey Mouse office of the Mexican Consulate in Anchorage, said deportation was inhumane.  Now she&rsquo;s backtracking so far b/c her previous position was so toxic, that she now daring to blaspheme the Holy Church of Dutcholyatry, noting his 1986 amnesty treachery.  (Ironically, and this is relevant b/c Bristol+Levi is back on, as Steve Sailer pointed out, Alaska is one of the last few places left in the country where a young white man with a strong back and really nothing in the way of brains, like Levi Johnston, can work a job all by himself a create an upper middle class lifestyle for himself, a wife and kids.  The reason for that is its distance from the Mexican border.  Yet, Levi&rsquo;s about to be mother-in-law seems to want to make that distance shorter.)</p>
<p>Will the real Sarah Palin please stand up?</p>
<p>9 The White Devil:</p>
<p>I think the late 1990s were even more fundamental than that.  I just happened to think that Clinton and the GOP Congress canceled some of each other&rsquo;s bad sides out, to wind up with some fairly decent policies.  Clinton did bomb Serbia, but he would have never countenanced a neo-con style expensive foreign occupation in response to a 9/11 style terrorist attack.  (I think if 9/11 happened under Clinton&rsquo;s watch, he would have stumbled onto the right thing, bombed the hell out of a few offenders, then come home).  On the other side of the ledger, the House GOP, with its power of the purse, kept social welfare spending reasonable, and precluded the creation of more social welfare programs   &mdash;   Clinton would have never gotten HCR.  They rebuked some of Clinton&rsquo;s attempts to implement unpopular liberal policy by stealth executive order, and bottled up a lot of his extremist judicial appointments.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the unemployment rate was decent and the budget showed a surplus in the late 1990s.  </p>
<p>(Though I think unemployment numbers then and now are underreported   &mdash;   The Feds changed the unemployment methodology in 1979   &mdash;   Using pre-&#8216;79 methods, the unemployment rate in the late 1990s never got far under 10%, and it would be pushing 20% now.)  </p>
<p>But like you, I think Obama is too much of a stone cold extremist kook wacko in his heart of hearts to moderate Clinton/Dick Morris style in the face of a hostile Congress and a re-election campaign.  Clinton may have wanted to do extremist kook wacko stuff, but he was a politician first and foremost.  </p>
<p>As an aside, even as the media kept telling us about Clinton&rsquo;s high approval numbers during the Lewinsky scandal, I think that was nothing more than people saying the economy was good.  I don&rsquo;t think Clinton would have won a third term vs George W. Bush, as the final polls in 2000 that accurately showed a Bush-Gore popular vote tie (about), also showed that Bush would have beat Clinton by 5 points.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, and rather fearful, that all these pundits and media are claiming the downturn in approval rating is SOLELY due to the economy.  There are so many OTHER reasons Whites are being drive away.  His obvious race pandering and taking care of his own. His obvious mistreatment of our allies and pandering to our enemies.  His complete ineptitude to hold the job he has.  His arrogance.  His appointment of unconstititional czars, all of whom are leftward leaning minions and radicals.  His turning NASA into a fuzzy bear for Muslims as their primary objective.  His sneering at America every time he is questioned.  But to the media, it&rsquo;s all about &#8220;the economy&#8221;.  That bothers me.  Why?  Because all they have to do just prior to the election is pump out false and misleading stats about a great economic recovery.  And keep beating that drum.  They will NEVER talk about all the other reasons Whites are falling away.  Hopefully, Whites won&rsquo;t buy the media hype, and remember that Obama is the ENEMY of Whites, and his administration is the ENEMY of a Constitutional Republic.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a college-educated white. Didn&rsquo;t vote for either moronic Bush or for lying Obama in 08, and Obama&rsquo;s floundering, deception and incompetence have justified my vote since. But idiot college educated  whites still support Obama. Those who don&rsquo;t base oppostion on the &#8220;economy&#8221;. These fools, likethe mainstream media, erroneouly believe America&rsquo;s President &#8220;runs&#8221; the economy.He doesn&rsquo;t.This isn&rsquo;t Soviet Union yet,tho we are developing our own little kind of affirmative action/welfare state socialism. Nevertheless, Wall St, the big international corporations and yes &#8220;consumers&#8221;, run this economy, with the help of the Fed and the mega bucks of the bloated Federal Govt, including the welfare office known as the Pentagon.  Our currency will eventually collapse, but not primarily because of our Kenyan leader.  The fat American people and their greed for consumer goods and a big government they don&rsquo;t want to pay for are the primary reason for our current economic woes which indeed will  plunge to Depression levels eventually. When we finally fall far behind Brazil, China and India in living standards perhaps the people will exercise their rational and natural rights. A new revolution. And a new constitution based on private property rights, privacy and freedom to be free from government.  Perhaps a partition of North America on rational lines based on culture. In any event, Obama is an economic ignoramus, but that is not why America is sinking into economic oblivion. He may be why America sinks, with the help of Hollywood and the Media,into cultural and racial chaos.</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what percentage of whites disapprove of Obama anymore because America now has a white population of only 60%. Obama basically has the support of the 40% that are minority, unless ALL whites vote as a block, it&rsquo;s almost impossible for him to lose in 2012.<br>
   In 10 more years the white population will slip below 50% and when that happens our politicians will be almost all black and hispanic.<br>
  It&rsquo;s over for the United States people. We&rsquo;ve lost. Canada and Europe are to follow.</p>

		<p>Obama is on the ropes and will likely get hammered in the 2010 elections. But he still has the GOP going for him. Obama will no doubt be vulnerable in 2012 but can anyone imagine a Romney or Gingrich going after him on social, cultural and racial issues? Of course not. They will pull a McCain and act the beautiful loser because Obama is black.</p>

		<p>I hate to say it, but I think that most of the whites who voted for Obama last time will probably vote for him again despite all of these bad polls. The Republicans don&rsquo;t seem to realize just how much the Bush administration damaged their credibility and since they haven&rsquo;t done anything to redeem themselves or show that they are even slightly embarrassed by what happened, most of the whites who defected to Obama have probably been captured permanently or at least semi-permanently by the Democrats.</p>
<p>If the stupid party runs Sarah Palin or somebody like Newt Gingrich, they&rsquo;re going to lose again and big time. Personally, I can&rsquo;t believe that they dusted off that old fossil Newt Gingrich and the fact that they&rsquo;re even mentioning him as a possible candidate just shows how out of touch they&rsquo;ve become. Dick Morris was right, I think, when he said it wouldn&rsquo;t be much longer before the Republicans are finished as a national party. Their days are over unless they purge the neoconservatives who took them over a long time ago.</p>
<p>The whites who defected to Obama did so out of complete and total disgust at what the GOP had become. Until Obama came along, Bush was a serious candidate for the worst president this country has ever seen, but now it looks like Obama could be even worse, hard as that is to believe. I suppose Obama could lose, but if he does lose it will probably be to another Democrat like Hillary Clinton   &mdash;   yet another nightmare scenario. In any case, both of the major parties are totally bankrupt, so I guess it doesn&rsquo;t really matter who wins the next election. They&rsquo;re all the same as far as I can tell.</p>

		<p>If Obama secures 40% of the white vote in 2012 (the same percentage that now approves of his performance according to the poll cited above), he will be re-elected.  He only won 43% of the white vote in 2008 and beat McCain by a 7% points. The last Democrat to win a majority of the white vote was LBJ in 1964.  Carter, Clinton and Obama were all elected with a white vote in the low 40s. </p>

		<p>Hopefully this is a Racial Realignment of the electorate!</p>
<p>Perhaps White Democrats are finally waking up and realizing that they are not wanted in the Democrat &#8216;rainbow coalition&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Recall that Thomas W. Chittum in his prophetic tome &#8216;Civil War 2&rsquo; predicted that the two parties would become racially polarized.  </p>
<p>P.S. Stop worrying so much about who any potential candidate shall be in 2012, that is like millions of years away in &#8216;political-time&rsquo;.  Assuredly some Paleo-conservative or Paleo-libertarian will pop up just in time to save the Republic.  </p>

		<p>Prepare yourselves for a challenge to Barack Hussein Obama by none other than Hillary Clinton for the 2012 Presidential nomination.</p>
<p>Obama will either resign after one term, leaving the nomination to Hillary, or she will challenge Obama after disastrous 2010 mid-term elections.</p>
<p>She won&rsquo;t have a legislative voting record to run against, but is every bit as much of a communist as the Idiot-in-Chief. </p>

		<p>I think #2 is right, the GOP doesn&rsquo;t want to topple BHO. The NAACP, Jackson, Sharpton and their ilk would love for BHO to be a one termer. A (half) black president undermines their elaborately constructed fantasy about how racist this country is. They can make a lot of political hay for themselves if BHO is voted out. The GOP (wisely) doesn&rsquo;t want to bear the brunt of the inevitable racism accusations if they win the next election.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a moot point anyway since White voters will vent their anger on the Dems in the mid-terms and then continue to pat themselves on the back by re-electing BHO in &#8216;12    </p>

		<p>Our White Communities cannot survive black rule.  The South&rsquo;s recovery from the War was delayed more than a decade because the Feds but the blacks in ruling positions over White Humanity. Disaster!</p>
<p>Blacks cannot make legitimate laws for White Men.  Only by force can White Men be expected to obey the blacks.   </p>
<p>And now start the eulogies for &#8220;Lawmaker&#8221; Billy McKinney.   He would not have had the opportunity to &#8220;make laws&#8221; for Whites but for Federal troops.</p>
<p>A black can never be a legitimate &#8220;lawmaker&#8221; of any laws that touch White Humanity.  Only by illegality and coercion can any black have authority over Whites.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are suffering a corruption that eat at the heart of our White Republic.  We must find was to free ourselves, starting with forcing White Liberal Elites to go the Full Bullock by committing themselves to abandoning all privileges that come with Whiteness and putting themselves under total rule by the blacks.  We must make examples of them and no longer allow them to enjoy the security that they steal from us.<br>

		<p>&#8220;A new Republican congress (will enact) pro-growth legislation that will improve economic conditions which the Obama machine will take credit for&#8221;</p>
<p>A very real possiblity. Aware that an incumbent will have the best chance of reelection during an upturn in the economy, the Obama administration knows it has just two arrows in its quiver for 2012: stimulus spending, and mass immigration. </p>
<p>Both of these produce a short term boost to the economic numbers, before the damage sets in.  </p>
