<h1>Chlorine and Curls: Why Many Black Women Won&rsquo;t Go Swimming</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jenna Flanagan, WNYC (New York), July 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Swimming is a great form of exercise, a refreshing summer activity and an important life skill. Yet African American women seem to be, let&rsquo;s say, less than enthusiastic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, black women don&rsquo;t swim.&#8221; Michael Hawkins, an instructor at Hair Design Institute in Manhattan, often hears that from clients, students and some stylists when the subject of swimming comes up. &#8220;She&rsquo;s not getting her hair wet. No that&rsquo;s not gonna happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most African-American women wear their hair chemically straightened or relaxed.</p>
<p>To get that look, stylsts often use a chemical called sodium hydroxide to re-shape black hair into a straighter form. But pool water can be detrimental to that.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the chlorine in the water, sometimes the salt or whatever works against the actual relaxer that you put in the hair. So over time you end up having breakage or hair shedding, coming out, things like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not properly cared for, black hair, especially in a relaxed state, won&rsquo;t grow long. But this isn&rsquo;t just about damaged hair.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mourning says black women&rsquo;s complex relationship with their hair can be traced back to antebellium America, when long straight hair was the one of the most symbolic markers of beauty. She says from there it&rsquo;s no surprise that the country&rsquo;s first black millionaire, and the first American woman ever to earn a million dollars, was Madam CJ Walker, who developed a line of beauty and hair care products specifically for black women.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not just making them beautiful, but also making them respectable,&#8221; Mourning explains. &#8220;Giving them the kind of image which is consistent with that of a &#8216;lady&rsquo; of society.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Mourning says there&rsquo;s more to the swimming issue than just hair. The smaller numbers of African-American swimmers can also be traced back to segregation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only were public pools off limits to black people, but there was also this sense that that would just be an unbearably intimate kind of place for blacks and whites to mix,&#8221; Mourning says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Teria Sutton, a 19-year-old lifeguard at the pool, wears her hair relaxed, but says she&rsquo;s become accustomed to swimming with it. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sutton says it was important for her to conquer her fear of deep water but speculates some of her girlfriends hesitation to do the same has less to do with hair and more to do with a fear of not knowing how to swim well.</p>

		<p>I get sick of hearing of stories about black women&rsquo;s hair.  Racism causes black women to spend too much on hair care products, black women don&rsquo;t exercise because their hair care takes up too much of their time, black women don&rsquo;t take care of their children because they spend too much time at the beauty parlor.  Now this ridiculous story about black women and swimming pools that has absolutely no point to it whatsoever unless they&rsquo;re implying that swimming pools are racist.  White women get perms but I don&rsquo;t ever recall seeing a story about why White women don&rsquo;t go swimming, if indeed they do.  If that hair is so high maintenance it sounds like it&rsquo;s not worth the trouble if it places so many restrictions on them.  Just let it grow naturally and all you&rsquo;ve have to do is take a pick to it a couple of minutes a day.    </p>

		<p>I think the hair thing is an excuse.  Following its logic, then black women can&rsquo;t ever take showers, because that would mess up the long and arduous do.  Obviously, they do, and if they&rsquo;re worried about their hair, I&rsquo;m sure there are ways to cover it up in the shower, which would work just as well in the pool.  Apropos because any decent pool is going to make you shower before entering.</p>

		<p>God- ever since Chris Rock&rsquo;s documentary they have really been harping on how hair issues hinder black women.</p>
<p>I guess they want us to subsidize that next!</p>
<p>I am a white woman with naturally curly hair.  Yes I have it chemically straightened and yes chlorine and salt water remove the process.  It does the same for many women who color their hair as well.  Do I refrain from swimming?  No.  I wear a swim cap or put my hair up.  It&rsquo;s really not that big of a deal!!!!</p>

		<p>In my Southeastern hometown, the local Community College cranks out about 200 Cosmotologist grads per year in a county with a population of about 145,000. Most are Black women, closely followed by White girls with tatoos and body piercings, and a fair number of Hispanic girls, and a couple of gay/transgenderd males thrown in for the salsa.  It&rsquo;s a real freak show watching these &#8220;students&#8221; come and go. </p>
<p>Around her the economy has been reduced to hairdos, nail filings, tatoo parlors, and making the weekly rent-to-own $35 payment on a set of made in China Hoopty rims and tires for a $500.00 Caprice Classic.</p>

		<p>Attention publishers of high school Chemistry textbooks: </p>
<p>You now have an opportunity for a &#8220;Minority Engagement&#8221; teachable moment for a Chemistry lesson. </p>
<p>It would be a hit at the next textbook trade show.</p>

		<p>This is increadibly dumb. Many white women have hair sensitive to chlorine and wear bathing caps. No big whop. A white woman would never consider giving up swimming when theres such a simple solution.</p>

		<p>Black women are obsessed with the topic of hair. Probably even more so than skin.</p>

		<p>Most swimming facilities and beaches in the USA remain, thankfully, predominantly white.  But, most blacks, and even &#8220;educated&#8221; black women are in this category, feel awkward at aquatic venues, which also happen to be primarily non-African recreational facilities. </p>
<p>Why?  </p>
<p>Their shrill voices, debased Southern accents, ridiculous hairdos, including the comic &#8220;braids&#8221; and &#8220;weaves&#8221;, elicit justified smirks, ironic and sarcastic thoughts, and facial expressions of disgust from white people on the beach or at the pool. Blacks are sentiment-based: they understand little of which they read or have to analyze on a multi-depth basis, but they do receive &#8220;vibes&#8221; well. They know whites know blacks are ridiculous. Thus the ludicrous and superficial excuses not to go to a pool like fear of hair defilement.</p>
<p>A few predominantly whiter skinned and acculturated blacks (not Basketball Barack Obama) are not ridiculous. But they are sparse.</p>
<p>Sentiment-based perception is no doubt a useful trait in Africa when a hungry Lion or poison-filled viper is nearby. </p>
<p>Thus, an appropriate comment to these water and sand-fearing folk could be: &#8220;That&rsquo;s Entertainment!&#8221; Blacks bring comic relief to the watery regions, except when their profanity and loud voices and incessant calls to each other as n  &mdash;    &mdash;  -r become irritating, boring and outright obnoxious to whites.<br>

		<p>I recently read a book, Contested Waters, about the social history of swimming pools.  Public pools were once segregated by gender, and only when this ended did race mixing became an issue.  Also, many cities had pools for blacks or allowed them to swim on certain days.  During the Civil Rights struggle, municipalities built even more, thinking that they might quell rioting.  When the NAACP and other groups demanded that white pools be opened to blacks, whites stopped going, cities lost money, and the pools closed.</p>

		<p>Another reason of course is that black people are not generally swimmers due to their history in Africa of shunning open water where crocodiles band snakes etc may (most likely will) be.  I lived in Africa for 23 years and black people did not even like swimming in the pools attached to homes.  We a servant (more than one over the years) who was a teenager who had moved down from Mozambique which after 25 odd years of civil war (bloody Communists again) was in a terrible state with people starving, so we took him in and gave him a job.  He was very grateful to eat regular meals same food as my wife and I plus the kids, and I invited him to use the pool when we were not on several occasions but he could not swim and was scared of the water, the reasons given probably due to the natural fear that they have from being a young child told by adults to keep out of the water in the rivers, etc the water also containing such diseases as bilharzia a nasty blood disease.</p>
<p>But the skin lightening creams in South Africa were big business as all women wanted to have at least a very light skinned face, but many enedeed up with permnant blotches using some of the faulty products that caused the then white Apartheid government to clamp down on the sales of such products.<br>
It is amazing how many of my US asociates are critical of your President Obama.  Looks like he is just another Tony Blair, a Socialist born to destroy economies?<br>
Good luck everyone and God bless America.  I love you all despite the nasty propaganda that many Brits do not, most of us do.<br>

		<p>There are plenty of places to swim if you feel a swimming pool is too intimate.</p>
<p>As a youth I spent more time swimming in lakes and rivers than I ever did in a pool. </p>
