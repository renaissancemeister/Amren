<p>An anti-Muslim populist in the Netherlands is forming an international alliance to spread his message across the west in an attempt to ban immigration from Islamic countries, among other goals.</p>
<p>Geert Wilders, leader of the Freedom party, told the Associated Press that he would launch the movement late this year, initially in five countries: the US, Canada, Britain, France and Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;The message, &#8216;stop Islam, defend freedom&rsquo;, is a message that&rsquo;s not only important for the Netherlands but for the whole free Western world,&#8221; Wilders said at the Dutch parliament.</p>
<p>Among the group&rsquo;s aims will be outlawing immigration from Islamic countries to the west and a ban on Islamic sharia law. Starting as a grassroots movement, he hopes it eventually will produce its own lawmakers or influence other legislators.</p>
<p>Ayhan Tonca, a prominent spokesman for Dutch Muslims, said he feared Wilders message would fall on fertile ground in much of Europe, where anti-Islam sentiment has been swelling for years.</p>
<p>&#8220;So long as things are going badly with the economy, a lot of people always need a scapegoat,&#8221; Tonca said. &#8220;At the moment, that is the Muslims in western Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tonca called on &#8220;well-meaning people in Europe to oppose this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Known for his bleached-blond mop of hair, Wilders is a shrewd politician who has won awards in the Netherlands for his debating skills and regularly stands up for gay and women&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>But he rose to local and then international prominence with his firebrand anti-Islam rhetoric that has led to him being charged under Dutch anti-hate speech laws and banned from visiting Britain until a court there ordered that he be allowed into the country.</p>
<p>Wilders said he hopes to position the alliance between traditional conservative parties and far-right wing groups, saying that in Britain there is &#8220;an enormous gap&#8221; between the ruling Conservative party and the far-right BNP: &#8220;The BNP is a party that, whatever you think of it, it&rsquo;s not my party I think it&rsquo;s a racist party,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Wilders, who calls Islam a &#8220;fascist&#8221; religion, has won increasing support the Netherlands in recent years even while he has been subjected to round-the-clock protection because of death threats.</p>
<p>His Freedom party won the biggest gains in a national election last month, coming third with 24 seats in the 150-seat parliament, up from the nine before the election.</p>
<p>However, mainstream parties will not form a coalition with Wilders, leaving him on the margins of Dutch politics for the next parliamentary term.</p>
<p>Wilders is due to stand trial in October on hate speech charges stemming from his short internet film Fitna, which denounced the Qur&rsquo;an as a a fascist book that inspires terrorism. The film aroused anti-Dutch protests around the Muslim world, and he was banned for several months from entering Britain.</p>
<p>But he is unrepentant and said he now wants to take his message outside the Netherlands.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fight for freedom and (against) Islamisation as I see it is a worldwide phenomenon and problem to be solved,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Wilders declined to name any of the other founders of the organisation he is calling the Geert Wilders International Freedom Alliance. He has been criticised for running his party as a one-man show.</p>

		<p>It is strange that any homophobic or fascist speakers or political movements are banned and discriminated against throughout the west, especially if their members attempt to enter other nations, but Muslims, who not only advocate such practices as the subjugation of women, racism, and the execution of Jews, Christians, and other non-Muslims, and the torture and execution of homosexuals, and the exportation of Islamic revolution, but also actively practice these things, are permitted to freely come and go as a protected minority throughout the West. Go figure. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure most users of AmRen sympathize with Wilders and wish his vision prevails in the USA.  Sorry, it won&rsquo;t.  Human rights, a code word for black and brown supremacy, reigns supreme in our media and in both parties.  Islamic ideology is the new Communism.Even by the time the Soviet Union collapsed because of its inherent rot, most Americans had little appetite for ideological battle for survival of the ideals of 1776, which were the freedom of white people and the protection of private property. Islam is a religious version of communism; those who oppose it are up against a totalitarian regime that our media and politicians are terrified of. </p>
<p>The stupid war in Afghanistan should be fought instead in our own nation against Muslims and illegal/legal immigrants from all non-White sources, Vietnam, China, India, Africa and the Caribbean, as well as from Mexico. </p>
<p>We Europeans are dying, and we are kissing the source of the infection.</p>

		<p>Great. Then all we would need to do is label countries &#8216;Islamic&rsquo; or Islamic sympathizers - all of them. At this point, you&rsquo;d have to label &#8216;white&rsquo; nations as being Islamic too&hellip; to prevent Muslim immigration and prevent the sewing of bad deeds among from one place to another&hellip;</p>

		<p>In the video on the website, Geert Wilders says the purpose of the website is to &#8220;defend freedom and stop Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notice how he doesn&rsquo;t say &#8220;radical Islam,&#8221; &#8220;Islamofascism,&#8221; &#8220;extremist Islam&#8221; or any other term to not offend hyper sensitive people? Instead he says &#8220;Islam.&#8221; Good job, good job. I admire his being so blunt.</p>

		<p>At his trial I hope he challenges the idea that all religions are the same. In the Dutch context, Islam means something very different to its followers than Christianity means to its followers. Identity, motivation, and international support are different between the two. Islam and Muslims are competitors with the indigenous Dutch and their Christianity. There will be a winner and a loser.</p>
<p>I really question whether his campaign can be successful where he bans Muslims, and only Muslims, from immigration. I can&rsquo;t see how this can be put into law. Better that all immigration is stopped. If he really wants to stop Muslims he might have to join forces with racists after all. I&rsquo;d like to ask him if there comes a point in his campaign where it looks like he is losing that he would join up with racists if that&rsquo;s what it would take to stop Islam.<br>

		<p>Good luck to Mr. Wilders!  Hopefully Belgium will collapse too. Wilders can be the European Putin IF he starts with Muslims and ends with Africans. The West can be revived IF AND ONLY IF the Dutch people feel they are worth preserving as a blood-based ethno-culture AND IF they inspire other Westerners to feel the same way. A lot of &#8216;IFs&rsquo;. The BNP, Haider &amp; Le Pen failed because the Brits, Austrians &amp; French lacked this sense.</p>

		<p>#1, Wilders is not homophobic and actually supports protection of gays against the incoming hoards of muslims.  Same with Jews.  As for being fascist he is the complete anti-fascist.  His platform is based on individual freedom and responsibility and to reduce the number of laws and the power of the state over individual freedoms.  The Orwellian press goes to extremes to twist this fact around.  He is much closer to Ron Paul than any other political figure in the west.</p>

		<p>Wilders is pro-multiracial and is against talking about racial differences.  He is not on our side.  Wilders thinks that anyone who notices that blacks are different than whites is &#8220;racist.&#8221;  He has denounced most real nationalists in Europe and is cozying up to American neocons and their fellow travelers.  This man does not deserve any support from white nationalists.  </p>

		<p>So Wilders is anti-BNP; Interesting. Well, maybe it&rsquo;ll give opponents more positions to consider, and more time in their brains before they reject the whole notion, more &#8216;shelf space&rsquo; as it were. Like maybe the chair legs that a lion tamer uses to confuse lions (after the movie &#8216;Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control&rsquo;). Well, probably not :) </p>

		<p>When he condemns the BNP because of their &#8220;racist&#8221; taint, he loses my sympathy.  He is just another neocon who is insisting that he is not a racist. Well then, he can get lost.  I want one who IS a racist.   When will we ever get over this paralysis at hearing the word &#8220;racism&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Islam has a morality standard for Muslims, and another standard for unbelievers, which is always to the advantage of Muslims. And in a Muslim country this is stimulant for unbelievers to convert. And if other religions try to impose and preach their ideas, Muslims are duty-bound to defend their faith with agression. </p>
<p>An example of this double morality standard is when Islam is mocked or shown in a bad light in some way, even if only in caricature form. Muslims will use violent means to attack such acts, but Muslims are perfectly happy to deprecate Jews and Christians in Muslim journals and on TV, and to attack a perceived enemy state. </p>
<p>Saudi Arabia finances the building of mosques all over the Western world, but under their own Sharia law the building of non-Islamic religious structures is not allowed. Muslims apparently don&rsquo;t see the irony in these double morality standards. That&rsquo;s because this double standard is the most important part of the traditional growth of Islam itself, and the repression of the Judeo/ Christian religions in competition with it</p>

<p>  Holland is an extremely liberal country and the banning of immigrants by race would receive little public support, as well as active opposition from Holland&rsquo;s privileged elites. Geert Wilders has go the anti-Muslim populist route. Radical Islam is seen, rightly I think, as a real threat to liberalism. Maybe, if the Freedom Party gets legs, they can go on to restrict all immigration. That is my hope at least.</p>

		<p>I applaud this very courageous and highly articulate man who is sacrificing his life and security for us.  His chances of being assassinated like Pym Fortuin and the Van Gogh (the film-maker) must be incredibly high, and I am sure he knows the risks. </p>
<p>I strongly suspect that he is also against &#8220;cultural enrichment&#8221; in general but he is smart enough to realise that adding this to his platform - at least at this stage - would put him beyond the pale as a &#8220;racist&#8221; and a &#8220;hater&#8221;.  If he were to side with the BNP, et al, the left and the MSM would devour him.</p>

		<p>Why do so many people here project their own beliefs onto Wilders rather than believe what the man himself actually says?</p>
<p>Why would he be lying when he says that he wants to end Muslim immigration but thinks it&rsquo;s wrong to notice racial differences or restrict non-white immigration generally?  That&rsquo;s the opinion of a good number of &#8220;conservative&#8221; pundits and media personalities in America these days.  That&rsquo;s why Wilders has been invited to give speeches to neocon groups here in the US and why he is getting good press from the same neocons who attack real nationalists like the BNP and FN.  </p>

&hellip;&#8221; Islam is a religious version of communism; those who oppose it are up against a totalitarian regime that our media and politicians are terrified of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Sorry Feller, I must disagree with you here.  Islam is NOT a form of communism, it is a religion that promotes an imperial, feudal order of religious monarchs.  This is why there are Aytolla&rsquo;s, Imams, etc., that deal with the feudal style monarchs of nations like Saudi Arabia and others.  Even in nations like Iran (perhaps the best example) that pretend to have democratic elections, are overlaid with religious leaders who seem to trump elected leaders anyway.  Only Israel represents an actual democracy in that region of the world, rather than a theocracy.  Islam makes it clear regarding its imperial structure in the Koran.  Islam never made use of religious communes the way that the Jews and quite obviously Christianity has for centuries since the beginning.  But even the Christian bible uses monarchal designations for its dieties.</p>
<p>So the philosophical question becomes, &#8220;Is a theorcracy ever disireable?&#8221;  I would postulate that the answer is no becuase my most sacred possession in my opinion is my freedom of conscience.  I don&rsquo;t want to be indoctrinated into any dogma, I want to be able to think things out for myself, in a culture that promotes critical thought.  </p>
<p>One of the main reasons I was moved to the Right was the buildup of the Left&rsquo;s efforts to control thoughts by controlling expression by for example, creating statutes regarding intangibles like &#8220;hate crimes,&#8221; lists of words that one race cannot speak while others are exempt, and the clear evidence of a racial conspiracy against me for being the race I am.  </p>
<p>For now, my worries about the Right attempting to force Christianity on everyone is less of a concern.  But in a scenario where say, the Right prevailed and we actually got this nation or a new nation under some sort of demographic control that allowed whites an ethnic state, I fear that the old problem of Christianity would arise again, because it is a historical fact, the theocractic push in America.  Just a little more than one hundred years ago, people were killing people in the United States over religion, and I mean different sects of Christianity.  The Irish Protestant/Catholic problems have had expression here as well.</p>
<p>But for the real origin of communism, you need look no further than early Christianity.  The early church, Gibbons illustrates, grew itself because of a combination of end time frenzy, which many bought into, helped along by the Roman excesses of rule and behaviors that saw many wealthy converting and actually giving all their wealth to the churches, which at that time were disparate, and only loosely unified (and also often at &#8220;war&#8221; with eachother).  But the conversion of the poor was much larger.  They were attracted by the churches policy, which was to use the donated wealth to care for the masses of poor converts.  That is institutional redistribution of wealth - communism.  What Paul did was expand, greatly, the old Jewish religious ascestic community idea to the world at large.  There is your commie bugaboo, right on your historic doorstep, or under your historic nose, so to speak.</p>
<p>As for Islam, it remains rooted in a fuedal system of rule and control.  There was never an Age of Reason in the Islamic world(which Gibbons had a great deal of influence upon in Europe).  The old Crusader fervor that my Norman ancestors possessed to the point of kamakazi like actions in battles en masse, was replaced with a return to a philosophically tempered religious style of the ancient world, aided by real advances in knowledge in the Western world that has torn down superstition and ignorance.  But in the Muslim world, science took a back seat.  So the preservation of Hellenic knowledge and wisdom was tranferred back to Europe to some degree during the occupation of Spain (and mostly by Jews), but as Islam grew, that knowledge pool receeded into a first century style religious/military movement that only increased as Europe moved away from it.</p>
<p>So today, we have military/religious leaders in the Islamic world that name their movements in the same style that a certain movement may have been called, &#8220;The Kingdom of God.&#8221;  You had to give up all your possessions (to the group) in order to join, and you needed a sword, and had to be prepared to &#8220;die by the sword.&#8221;  Sounds a lot like a 12th century crusader or a member of al queda, or Hezbolla today.  </p>
<p>As for our own intra-racial conumdrum, it is going to require more subtle analysis and vision than the old &#8220;they&rsquo;re commies!&#8221; to establish a cultural reality for whites in a post Diversity nation of any sort in the future.  There has never been a return to &#8220;the good old days,&#8221; ever.  Things are always different, even if some things appear similar.  So careful thought is required for our success.  That and I daresay, some tolerance amoung ourselves.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t react defensively.  Think about it, reader.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>I think I can understand what feller meant. Obviously, Islam is not the same thing as communism;  but there are interesting similarities. </p>
<p>What he sees, and I see too, is that there is no division of powers (i.e. church &amp; state) under Islam, nor under communism. In both of them, power is totally concentrated at the center.  The central authority, the sultan, the state, or whatever you want to call it, is the utter and absolute authority against which there is no appeal. There is no free thought.  Who controls the state, controls everything and  speaks with the unchallenged authority of god. There is no other way but their way.  It is the pope and the emperor all in one. A Stalin, a Mao,  or a  Khomeini would have understood this very well. They would have been very comfortable with it   &mdash;  - and were.</p>
<p>In Europe, east of communist Russia, there has been no historical parallel to such uncontested and total power. Even that paragon of royal absolutism, Louis XIV, the Sun King (l&rsquo;Etat c&rsquo;est moi), did not claim to speak for God as well. </p>

As Whiteplight says, in America today, there is no immediate threat of a theocracy looming over us   &mdash;   at present, anyway. But if other problems get sorted out, there could be such a threat somewhere in the future. There is that unfortunate historical tendency which some are attracted to, if we don&rsquo;t guard against it.</p>
<p>As he concludes (and I can&rsquo;t improve on his words): <i> &#8220;There has never been a return to &ldquo;the good old days.&rdquo;  Things are always different&hellip; So careful thought is required &hellip;that, and some tolerance among ourselves.&#8221; </i> Yes, we must be open-minded and always prepared to consider that we could be wrong   &mdash;   and the other guy, or faction   &mdash;   just might be right. It is utter narrow-minded rigidity that provides the basis for reigns of terror, religious wars, genocides. And we must bear in mind that these could go against us, just as well as for us.  It comes down to a simple case of applying the Golden Rule.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Then you are pinning your enthusiasm for him on a mere &ldquo;hope&rdquo;. <br>
That&rsquo;s not enough.<br>
It is a merely dream on your part, which he has already, in his own words, renounced. Do you think he&rsquo;s lying? <br>
Get real!&#8221;</p>
<p>  I wouldn&rsquo;t call myself enthusiastic for Geert Wilders, but stopping any Third World immigration to Holland is better than nothing. Half a glass of water is better than none. Holland is too liberal to take another political route at this time. A BNP or Front National (FN) wouldn&rsquo;t fly in the Netherlands your tilting windmills if you think they would.  </p>

		<p>In the West secular liberals are quick to defend Muslims, especially if they are Palestinians. Nevertheless, everything secular liberals hate about the Bible Belt and the religious right is far more true of Muslims, and Islamic society.  </p>

<p>Very true.  But one has  to define more precisely just who are those &#8220;secular liberals&#8221;. Many  liberal whites are rather vague and wishy washy  in their leftist commitment; but some are very clear about who  their enemies are.</p>
<p>One enormous advantage the Muslims have over the Bible Belt rednecks is that they are &#8220;exotic&#8221;, they are &#8220;minorities&#8221;, they represent the &#8220;other&#8221;.  Being the &#8220;other&#8221;, that places them automatically beyond criticism and on the side of  &#8220;all virtuous people&#8221; against the hated majority. Above all, they are non-European, non-Christian, and non-white.  They  may not, in fact, be loved for themselves, but they are a very useful part of the coalition of minorities that make up the battering ram  which is being used to bring down Western Christian culture. They serve a purpose for those who hate that culture more than anything else.</p>
