	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There is no reason to view the poor as stupid or in any way different from anyone else, says Daniel Nettle of the University of Newcastle in the UK. All of us are simply human beings, making the best of the hand life has dealt us. {snip}</p>
<p>Evolutionary theory predicts that if you are a mammal growing up in a harsh, unpredictable environment where you are susceptible to disease and might die young, then you should follow a &#8220;fast&#8221; reproductive strategy  &mdash;  grow up quickly, and have offspring early and close together so you can ensure leaving some viable progeny before you become ill or die. For a range of animal species there is evidence that this does happen. Now research suggests that humans are no exception.</p>
<p>Certainly the theory holds up in comparisons between people in rich and poor countries. Bobbi Low and her colleagues at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor compared information from nations across the world to see if the age at which women have children changes according to their life expectancy (Cross-Cultural Research, vol 42, p 201). &#8220;We found that the human data fit the general mammalian pattern,&#8221; says Low. &#8220;The shorter life expectancy was, the earlier women had their first child.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} In a study of over 8000 families, he [Nettle] found that in the most deprived parts of England people can barely expect 50 years of healthy life, nearly two decades less than in affluent areas. And sure enough, women from poor neighbourhoods are likely to have their babies at an early age and in quick succession. They have smaller babies and they breastfeed less, both of which make it easier to get pregnant again sooner (Behavioral Ecology, DOI: 10.1093/beheco/arp202).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} At a meeting last year, Sarah Johns at the University of Kent in Canterbury, UK, reported that in her study of young women from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds in Gloucestershire, UK, those who perceived their environment as risky or dangerous, and those that thought they might die at a relatively young age, were more likely to become mothers while they were in their teens. {snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same story in the US. The latest figures, from 2005, reveal that teenage motherhood accounts for 34 per cent of first births among African Americans  &mdash;  who are more likely to live in deprived areas  &mdash;  and 19 per cent among whites. Arline Geronimus of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, who has studied health inequalities and reproductive patterns, points out that healthy life expectancy is short for African Americans and women depend on extended family networks for support. This means it is in their interests to have children while they still have relatives in good physical shape to help out.</p>
<p>The shockingly rapid deterioration in health experienced by women in poor black neighbourhoods also directly affects mothers. {snip} Geronimus and her colleagues found that in Harlem, a poor neighbourhood in New York City, the infant mortality rate for babies born to mothers in their 20s was twice that of the babies of teenage mums (Political Science Quarterly, vol 112, p 405). Geronimus thinks the situation may be even worse now, given that the rate of health deterioration in black women has increased in the past decade.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another important issue is whether or not a girl&rsquo;s father is around when she is growing up. Developmental psychologist Bruce Ellis, of the University of Arizona in Tucson, has studied extensively the effects of girls&rsquo; relationships with their fathers. His research shows that the less involved a father is with his daughter from an early age, and the less warm the relationship, the earlier she starts having sex and, potentially, babies (New Scientist, 14 February 2007, p 38).</p>
<p>Fathers in deprived neighbourhoods are more likely to be absent, which could be because they are following &#8220;fast&#8221; strategies of their own. These include risky activities designed to increase their wealth, prestige and dominance, allowing them to compete more successfully with other men for sexual opportunities. These needn&rsquo;t necessarily be antisocial, but often they are. &#8220;I&rsquo;m thinking about crime here, I&rsquo;m thinking about gambling,&#8221; says Nettle, and other risky or violent behaviours that we know are typical of men in rough environments. A fast strategy also means a father is less likely to stick with one woman for the long term, reducing his involvement with his children.</p>
<p><b>Paternal benefits</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} For one thing, Nettle&rsquo;s large-scale study of families in England found that babies born in the poorest areas have slower cognitive development, which compromises their education and prospects later in life.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Once you are in a situation where the expected healthy lifetime is short whatever you do, then there is less incentive to look after yourself. Investing a lot in your health in a bad environment is like spending a fortune on maintaining a car in a place where most cars get stolen anyway, says Nettle. It makes more sense to live in the moment and put your energies into reproduction now.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perhaps the most compelling evidence for this comes from real-life situations. In the mid-1990s, the residents of one poor, mainly Native American district in North Carolina each received a windfall in the form of royalties from a casino that had been built on their land. After the windfall, the researchers recorded a significant reduction in conduct disorder  &mdash;  the psychologist&rsquo;s term for antisocial behaviour  &mdash;  among the poorest children (The Journal of the American Medical Association, vol 290, p 2023).</p>
<p>On a larger scale, during the 1990s there was a dramatic decline in teenage birth rates in the US, especially among African Americans. In 1993, 6.4 per cent of black girls aged between 15 and 17 became first-time mothers but by 2000 this had dropped to 4.5 per cent (Social Science and Medicine, vol 63, p 1531). Geronimus puts this down in part to the strong economic expansion and increase in employment rates during this time, which offered young black women job opportunities they were unlikely to have had before. Teen births among African Americans are now rising again, predictably, given the recent economic nosedive.</p>
<p><b>It&rsquo;s all relative</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bottom line, if young people are to avoid being channelled into a fast reproductive strategy with the disadvantages that this entails, is that they should have the chance to develop a longer view  &mdash;  through better availability of jobs and health support. They need reasons to believe they have a stake in the future.<br>

		<p>What all these &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; people have in common is the inability to delay gratification, and think about their future. They are also flat-out lazy. This is why they die young. The &#8220;I want it now&#8221; syndrome. Don&rsquo;t have money? No problem, I&rsquo;ll just steal it. Hate somebody? No problem, I&rsquo;ll just kill him. Want to get high? No problem, let&rsquo;s destroy a few thousand brain cells. Got an overactive libido? No problem, there&rsquo;s lots of willing partners, and no birth control in sight. </p>

		<p>Research shows that the human brain actually stops developing around age 25, with the risk taking controlling aspects forming last.<br>
Then add that with constant lowering of the ages for the onset of puberty worldwide.<br>
Here in the West specifically because we have the forced introduction of peoples from more primitive agriculturally reliant cultures where maturing earlier is requirement for survival.<br>
Then add that with our own in house problem of the breakdown of the family unit, where the presence (smell) of the genetically unrelated father is said to bring on puberty earlier in girls.<br>
And there&rsquo;s been another recent study that claims that child hood obesity also brings on puberty earlier.<br>
Then sprinkle over the top of this the pop culture media&rsquo;s constant message of &#8220;be young, look good, date, party, consume, experiment, confirm to non conformity and by all means stay free&#8221; means this is all only going to worse as time goes on as the gap between the breeding ages and the ability to mentally reason ages gets wider.<br>
Re the medias influence remember it&rsquo;s in &#8216;big businesses&rsquo; interest to have a large idiot population of cheap workers/consumers (cultural &/or national background is irrelevant also), as they just want the numbers, and hey it&rsquo;s the founding stocks/tax payers problem to foot the bill for the fallout, but don&rsquo;t dare complain as you&rsquo;ll be tarred and feathered from the population being mass conditioned by the previously mentioned media.<br>
Imagine how different the world would be if the voting, military enlistment and breeding ages were raised to 25.<br>

		<p>Some of you aren&rsquo;t getting what&rsquo;s being argued.</p>
<p>This is an evolutionary argument for the social privileged view.  It&rsquo;s saying that inequality is due to some people not being economically privileged, and this, given their biopsychology, leads then to low class behavior, one aspect of which is having a low IQ. (The other view is the functional view:  Having a low IQ leads to low achievement and impulse control, which leads to social disparity.) </p>
<p>They even cite Blacks as a group that wasn&rsquo;t privileged.<br>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter if the person&rsquo;s IQ is 125.  If he does drugs on a regular basis, steals, has unprotected sex, gets drunk all the time, and hangs out with shiftless people he is just plain STUPID in his behavior and his chances of becoming something are inversely proportional to stupid behavior and choices.</p>

		<p>1.  When did welfare reform go into effect?  Mid 90s?  Gasp.  No more free food/money/housing.</p>
<p>2.  When did we start seeing endless amounts of &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; prerequisites in everything from the job market to housing loans?  Gag.  Say it isn&rsquo;t so Joe!</p>
<p>3.  WHAT PERCENTAGE of the total American population is the black subsegment composed?  13?</p>
<p>We now live in a shattered economy which was, in large part, destroyed because Banks were in a cutthroat environment of get-big-or-get-eaten forced mergers (which destroyed local institutions in favor of more-FED) and yet they could only be approved for most mergers by accepting Federal CRA guidelines that amounted to BILLIONS in bad real estate loan guarantees.</p>
<p>Assuming race doesn&rsquo;t exist and &#8216;we&rsquo;re all human&rsquo; is the health of one &#8216;mammal&rsquo; worth the health of all the others when giving that lowest-pop-segment = dumbest genes special considerations and privilege in fact leads to destruction for ALL of us when they (as dumb people do) default?</p>
<p>We either need to accept that trading happiness for breeding rights means a permanent dole system for a given &#8216;carrying capacity&rsquo; element of our society (1 child per couple please).</p>
<p>Or we need to SERIOUSLY engage in genetic studies which allow us to raise the mean intelligence across the board so that we are not forced to lie to ourselves based covering up specific IQ = employability (R .73) variations specific to ONE population group.</p>
<p>Anything else is Ostritching, plain and simple.</p>

		<p>Sure. All sorts of chemicals flowing the body that are a result from stress and the persistence of danger. The body changes, you live less, you reproduce earlier and more so too.</p>
<p>This phenomenon has been observed some time ago. 27 % of black girls in the U.S. can have a baby when they are nine years old, compared to only 9 % of white girls. They mature at an earlier age, and mature faster and more so when they do mature.</p>

		<p>I think the whole human race is hanging itself over this &#8220;equality&#8221; thing, in a biological sense, and most certainly in a socioeconomic sense. Consider:</p>
<p>The various races, nationalities and ethnicities of Homo Sapiens are equal only in that they belong to the order of primates, in the mammal class in the animal kingdom. Our mothers GAVE BIRTH to us, combed and washed our HAIR, and cut the nails on our FOUR LIMBS (emphasis added). This is true, regardless of when and where we came into the world.</p>
<p>After that, it&rsquo;s a whole new ball game. DNA and genetic makeup all are different in people, whether they come from the same country, city, block or even family. The only life forms that are equal in a biological sense are identical twins.</p>
<p>I realize that&rsquo;s an oversimplification, but I&rsquo;m trying to point out that humans are unequal to each other in a biological sense. No judge can bang a gavel and decree that an Australoid is equal to a Nordic. Nor can any parliament pass a law saying that a Chinese is equal to a Sicilian. It just doesn&rsquo;t happen in the natural world.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the artificial, i.e., man made world. This is where things get sticky. </p>
<p>There are some 200 nations and territories on planet Earth. Each of them have different races and ethnicities living in them. Each of these nations and territories has different cultures, subcultures and hypo-subcultures within them. Each has different economic and financial performance and needs. People who scream and demand &#8220;economic equality&#8221; for each of the nearly 7 billion inhabitants of planet Earth just don&rsquo;t get it. It will NEVER happen. A Papua New Guinea hunter will never be economically equal to a Japanese industrialist. An Icelandic sailor will never be economically equal to a Manhattan stockbroker. The education, skills, interests and cultures are too different. Nobody can make them equal.</p>
<p>Which begs the bigger question: How can things be equal if they are so totally diverse? </p>
<p>To Just Saying (re post # 4):</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t have to be poor to make bad choices. Look at Michael Vick. He wasn&rsquo;t poor, but he made a bad choice to operate a dog fighting pit, while he was being paid millions of dollars by the Atlanta Falcons. Look at all the millionaire actors and actresses who wind up in alcohol or drug rehab clinics (Robert Downey Jr., and Lindsay Lohan). Then, look at some those who grew up poor, but were determined to better themselves (Charles Dickens, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Carnegie, Richard Petty).</p>
<p>A man or woman may be poor in the wallet or purse, but rich in brain.  <br>

		<p>White privilege or White enterprise.</p>
<p>Australia is a modern progressive wealthy nation with a very high standard of living and good life expectancy. How did it get this way, quite simply by hard work and enterprise. Yet just a little over 200 years ago it was little more than a very barren rugged land at the end of the earth that was being used as a dumping ground for England&rsquo;s prison population. Very little white prvilege to speak of here!</p>
<p>And an amazing story that possibly has not been told: In the 60&rsquo;s a group of Americans established a cotton industry here in outback NSW &amp; QLD. They brought the know-how that America used to be famous for, as well as equipment and dollars. It has been a very successful enterprise and a huge employer &amp; economic boost.There was one rule for workers on the cotton,&#8221;We pay well, you work hard but talk Union and you are OUT&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
America needs to be great again, I just can not believe what is happening to your nation. AA, PC &amp; Welfare as an alternative to getting a job are just a cancers that are destroying the worlds greatest nation. Add this to White Guilt,(Whatever that is meant to be) Open Borders to the 3rd World and your present administration, things do not look good.</p>

 <br>
Yes. If those parents-to-be thought beyond living in the moment and contemplated the future of any potential children they might produce; then poverty and a dangerous environment would definitely discourage reproduction. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, character strengths such as emotional maturity, intelligence, and foresight aren&rsquo;t equally distributed with hormones.<br>

		<p>Thing is, we are human beings with rational brains and an ability to think about the future.  We have created great societies because we are NOT ruled entirely by our base instincts.  Or maybe only some of us are&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, I was born to a VERY poor, single mom.  We had nothing.  I mean it - nothing.  I remember thinking ever since I was very small that having nothing sucked and that the reason we had nothing is because my mother started to have children before she built anything for herself. </p>
<p>So, because I had a rational, HUMAN mind I concluded that I should build something first, then get married and then have children.  </p>
<p>Mammals in the animal kingdom may follow a certain pattern because of their spans or resources, but we are PEOPLE.  One of the things that separates from the animals is that we actually make conscious decisions about reproduction.  </p>
<p>PS - as a young woman I have never, EVER understood why any woman these days would have a child as a teenager.  I mean, really, for the first time in the history of humanity, a woman can consciously choose when to have a baby and there is virtually no stigma attached to never having one.  Taking a look at my family tree you only see generation after generation of women getting married as teenagers and having at least five kids.  Why?  Because that was their only option.  Trust me, if she had any other options my great-grandmother would not have gotten married at 15, lived in a shack, and had ten kids.  I cannot for the life of my fathom why any girl in the USA would consciously CHOOSE that for herself (minus the marriage of course).  You were lucky enough to have been born in a time when you can live life for YOURSELF if you so chose.  </p>
