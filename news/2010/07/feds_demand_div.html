			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carrie Budoff Brown, Politico, July 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A little-noticed section of the Wall Street reform law grants the federal government broad new powers to compel financial firms to hire more women and minorities  &mdash;  an effort at promoting diversity that&rsquo;s drawing fire from Republicans who say it could lead to de facto hiring quotas.</p>
<p>Deep inside the massive overhaul bill, Congress gives the federal government authority to terminate contracts with any financial firm that fails to ensure the &#8220;fair inclusion&#8221; of women and minorities, forcing every kind of company from a Wall Street giant to a mom-and-pop law office to account for the composition of its work force.</p>
<p>Employment law experts say the language goes further than any previous attempt by the U.S. government to promote diversity in the financial sector  &mdash;  putting muscle behind federal efforts to help minority- and women-owned firms gain access to billions in federal contracts.</p>
<p>For advocates of the measure, it is a past-due shove to an elite industry that is heavily male and white  &mdash;  one in which Government Accountability Office studies show women and minorities have made only minimal gains in the past 15 years.</p>
<p>But to opponents, the provision signifies a brazen government intrusion into corporate practices, with language written so vaguely that some believe it could lead to an unofficial quota system.</p>
<p>&#8220;This expands exponentially the reach of the federal government in terms of auditing,&#8221; said Peter Kirsanow, an attorney and Republican appointee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. &#8220;This is an expansion of racial engineering that we haven&rsquo;t seen in a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The law sets no quotas, not even ratios or goals for hiring. And the government has options other than termination at its disposal for contractors who fail to meet the &#8220;fair inclusion&#8221; standard, including referring the matter to the Labor Department.</p>
<p>But the law tiptoes up to the line of quotas, say critics  &mdash;  a group that includes Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine); four Republican-leaning members of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights who wrote a letter of opposition; and some in the conservative blogosphere, where a debate has raged for weeks outside the view of the mainstream media.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very sweeping, from my review of the legislation,&#8221; said Collins, who voted for the bill. &#8220;It talks not just about federal offices and agencies. It also talks about contractors and subcontractors, and so the implications are very unclear and can be read to require quotas, and that&rsquo;s an entirely different and controversial debate and does not belong in the financial bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It is arguably the best part of the bill,&#8221; said Gary Acosta, co-founder of the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals, which lobbied for the section.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 1,261-word section authored by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) barely registered during the legislative debate. And even weeks after the legislation moved through the House and Senate, Washington groups tasked with protecting business interests on Wall Street and beyond say they have yet to study that part of the bill.</p>
<p>At its core, the section establishes at least 20 new Offices of Minority and Women Inclusion across the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission and other finance-related agencies. It orders the directors of these offices to develop standards that &#8220;ensure, to the maximum extent possible, the fair inclusion and utilization of minorities, women, and minority-owned and women-owned businesses in all business and activities of the agency at all levels, including in procurement, insurance, and all types of contracts.&#8221;</p>
<p>This applies to &#8220;services of any kind,&#8221; including investment firms, mortgage banking firms, asset management firms, brokers, dealers, underwriters, accountants, consultants and law firms, the legislation states. Every contractor and subcontractor must now certify that their workforces reflect a &#8220;fair inclusion&#8221; of women and minorities.</p>
<p>The government still must write the rules for the new diversity standards before deciding which contractors meet the bar and which fall short.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Diana Furchtgott-Roth, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and chief economist at the Labor Department under President George W. Bush, nudged the issue into the mainstream last month with a column posted on RealClearMarkets.com.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Your workforce doesn&rsquo;t have to be exact, but you have to try to make an effort,&#8221; said Pamela Bethel, a partner at O&rsquo;Riordan Bethel law firm who testified before Waters&rsquo; committee on behalf of the National Association of Minority and Women-Owned Law Firms. &#8220;Nobody is suggesting you hire someone who isn&rsquo;t qualified, but if you look just a little harder outside your country club, you might find someone who is qualified.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also of concern to some on the right is that the law creates another layer of bureaucracy that small businesses will need to navigate.</p>

		<p>It becoming quite clear, the Civil Rights Movement was a total failure. The liberals don&rsquo;t want a racially blind system where one is judged on their individual merit and not on their race, they just want to swap out the victims of discrimination from black to white. Liberals today stand for everything that the Civil Rights Movement was against and we need to make that fact well known. We need to stigmatize these liberals who are in favor of racial discrimination in our laws the way they have successfully stigmatized people who accept the reality of racial differences.</p>

		<p>This is the source referenced in the Politico article that &#8220;nudged the [racial preferences] issue into the mainstream last month&#8221;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Racial, Gender Quotas in the Financial Bill?&rdquo; By Diana Furchtgott-Roth, REAL CLEAR MARKETS, July 8, 2010:<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/2aot86d" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2aot86d</a> </p>
<p>Some highlights:</p>
<p>Section 342 of the financial reform bill will establish 20 new Offices of Women and Minority Inclusion within the federal government to monitor diversity in the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Securities Exchange Commission, Federal Housing Finance Agency and other finance-related agencies. </p>
<p>Effects of the new racial and gender preferences on efficiency? The bill is &#8220;certain to increase inefficiency in federal agencies. To comply, federal agencies are likely to find it easier to employ and contract with less-qualified women and minorities, merely in order to avoid regulatory trouble.&rdquo;<br>

<p>This is just one example of what I meant when I wrote that Obama&rsquo;s reason for wanting to be president was to promote blacks any way he can, because they absolutely positively can&rsquo;t qualify on their own due to low intelligence and ability.</p>
<p>So far, every piece of legislation passed mandates a quota system for blacks&hellip;.even doctors.</p>
<p>The country was harmed greatly by Carter, Clinton and Bush, but it will never survive this latest all black promotion to squeeze blacks into slots they just can&rsquo;t do.  We would soon reach Brazil status if the economy wasn&rsquo;t going to cause us to bypass it and erupt into breakup before that particular phase occurs.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a sample of future events on Wall Street:</p>
<p>Lady broker: &#8220;Oh, you don&rsquo;t want to buy that stock Mr. Jones, it&rsquo;s been doing poorly. What? No, listen; Better Baby Baskets is your best choice. I know Mr. Jones, I know that you prefer stocks in that other industry, but didn&rsquo;t you mention your wife &mdash; she didn&rsquo;t care for them. You told me that me Jones. It&rsquo;s best you follow your wife&rsquo;s advice Mr. Jones.&#8221; (And on and on she goes.)</p>
<p>Another: &#8220;Yo, what&rsquo;s up? Yeah, sure man, we gots that stock. You be&rsquo;s really interested in that? Sure brother, no problem. I be pulling it up now, hold tight.&#8221; (You&rsquo;ll have to learn Ebonics to trade.)</p>
<p>This is not a joke people. It&rsquo;ll be real. And you know it because you&rsquo;ve already experienced similar situations.<br>

		<p>If Wall Street companies are forced to hire non-white people they are going to hire East Asians and Indians.  Remember whenever there are racial &#8220;justice&#8221; programs East Asians benefit the most even though the programs are designed to help black and Latino people.  Black people are the battering rams for diversity.</p>

		<p>I hope #4 is right: that Prez. Obama&rsquo;s objective is to promote and benefit Blacks. If that were the case, white men would still do fairly well. The problem is that Obama&rsquo;s objective seems to be destroying white men, not specifically helping blacks (this was also his mother&rsquo;s attitude). Also note that it was Congress that passed the legislation.<br>
Since many white men have great jobs in financial institutions, the obvious action is to remove them and replace with women and non-whites. Most of whom will be non-black, but that doesn&rsquo;t bother your president or the liberals and feminists in congress. </p>

		<p>Well, that makes it pretty much a 1000 batting average.  EVERY bill Obama has passed has some sort of &#8220;gimme&#8221; handout to the BLACKS in it, be it mortgage bailouts, auto bailouts, financial reform, etc etc.  Every one.  And who gets to pay?  Successful Whites, be it through taxes or forced upon successful traditional White run businesses.<br>

		<p>These provisions are clearly unconstitutional and illegal as they suborn financial institutions to racially discriminate (against whites but they count too).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time we end racial discrimination against people of light pigmentation. Is there no civil rights institute that will help a institution file such a civil suit against these provisions of the law put in by the awful Black Caucus?  </p>

		<p>Wall street contributes to Ford Foundation, ADL, NAACP and all the other anti White organizations.  It is located in and leads the most powerful anti White city in the country.  Wall street shoved in David Dinkins. When Guilianni the best mayor NYC has had in this century was elected Wall Streeters vilified him as he sent the crime rate spiraling down.</p>
<p>Let Wall Street suffer the same discrimination their money to the blacks and commies has led to discrimination against Whites.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think Wall Street is all that smart. They heavily supported Obama and his anti-capitalist beliefs. I often wonder: what is is going to take to awaken the white liberal. He seems unable to distinguish between friend and foe. He never criticizes the insistence on racial unity by blacks, so he must approve. But, woe to any white man who urges the same!<br>
I despise them. The SPLC is the poster case.<br>

<p>Look outside your country club? How rude. For your information, lady, you would have to look pretty far and wide to find a decent number of truly qualified minorities to work in any high-paying job. And &#8220;qualified&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t just mean they have a degree, because we all know they have affirmative action to help them get into college and guilty liberal teachers to help them pass without actually trying. If I were a Wall Street businessman, the only minorities I would hire would be women, Asians, and Jews. Blacks and Hispanics can look for work and the Denny&rsquo;s across the street.</p>
