			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Gaynor, Reuters, July 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nicaraguan mother Lorena Aguilar hawks a television set and a few clothes on the baking sidewalk outside her west Phoenix apartment block.</p>
<p>A few paces up the street, her undocumented Mexican neighbor Wendi Villasenor touts a kitchen table, some chairs and a few dishes as her family scrambles to get out of Arizona ahead of a looming crackdown on illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone is selling up the little they have and leaving,&#8221; said Villasenor, 31, who is headed for Pennsylvania. &#8220;We have no alternative. They have us cornered.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two women are among scores of illegal immigrant families across Phoenix hauling the contents of their homes into the yard this weekend as they rush to sell up and get out before the state law takes effect on Thursday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.S. government estimates 100,000 unauthorized migrants left Arizona after the state passed an employer sanctions law three years ago requiring companies to verify workers&rsquo; status using a federal computer system. There are no figures for the number who have left since the new law passed in April.</p>
<p>Some are heading back to Mexico or to neighboring states. Others are staying put and taking their chances.</p>
<p>In a sign of a gathering exodus, Mexican businesses from grocers and butcher shops to diners and beauty salons have shut their doors in recent weeks as their owners and clients leave.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>LEGAL RESIDENTS FLEE</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexican housewife Gabriela Jaquez, 37, said she is selling up and leaving for New Mexico with her husband, who is a legal resident, and two children born in Phoenix.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the law, if you transport an illegal immigrant, you are committing a crime,&#8221; she said as she sold children&rsquo;s clothes at a yard sale with three other families. &#8220;They could arrest him for driving me to the shops.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lunaly Bustillos, a legal resident from Mexico, hoped to sell some clothes, dumbbells and an ornamental statue on Sunday before her family heads for Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes me sad and angry too because I feel I have the right to be here,&#8221; said Bustillos, 17, who recently graduated from high school in Phoenix.<br>

		<p>From Tucson, Arizona: we are used to seeing A LOT of Sonora (Mexican state) license plates at my large apartment complex of about 200 units. In the past two weeks, the cars with the Mexican plates have been rapidly disappearing. My complex is quickly becoming filled with young Whites, mostly University of Arizona students and young White married twentysomethings.</p>
<p>We might recall that the 1954 &#8220;Operation Wetback&#8221; saw 500,000 to 700,000 Mexican illegals repatriate BEFORE the operation went into effect. They were scared; they fled. It&rsquo;s 1954 all over again. </p>
<p>BTW, for all of the anti-SB 1070 libtards out there: on my drive home today, I passed many homeless Whites who are &#8220;living&#8221; on the street. With fewer illegal parasites sucking off our welfare system and clogging up our prisons, we White Americans can now reach out to and uplift our people who have fallen on hard times.</p>

		<p>I think what happened here is that they were waiting out the first court hearing.  Now that appears that the Federal trial level judge will let most or all of the law stand by the time Thursday (enforcement day) comes, they have read the tea leaves, and are leaving.  Until their new state passes a 1070.</p>
<p>An AR poster Friday stated that 1070&rsquo;s real purpose is to catch illegals hauling big dope quantities or slinging dope.  I&rsquo;m beginning to think he or she was right.  I re-read 1070, and it seems to have the biggest disparate impact on two groups of illegal aliens:  One, selling/possessing dope, meth precursors, guns or terrorist ordinance.  Two, those that are smuggling minors either by force of arms or unaccompanied by adult relatives.</p>
<p>This article is probably more proof of that.  Obama&rsquo;s ICE people have already come out and said that they&rsquo;re not going to process illegals that 1070 nets for &#8220;deportation&#8221; (such as it is, or isn&rsquo;t) proceedings.  So why are these illegals in AZ in fear such that they&rsquo;re leaving?  Answer:  Because they are involved in the nefarious illegal side activities that 1070 targets by name, along with being here illegally.  The Feds don&rsquo;t do much about illegal immigration per se, but do get involved when dope and smuggling is involved.</p>
<p>Also reading the tea leaves is the media.  They&rsquo;re finally beginning to push out articles today that read like Jared Taylor or Glenn Spencer could have written them.  They, too, have read the writing on the wall.</p>

		<p>So, the law is working as intended, then? </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s remarkable how the slightest demonstration of willpower by a government official as minor as a state governor can have such an overt impact on illegal immigration. If only others would follow suit. </p>

		<p>White Man, write to your politicians and DEMAND a law similar to Arizona&rsquo;s.  </p>
<p>Short-term goal: get as many states as possible to pass Arizona-style laws to shake up the illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Long-term goal: abandon the current erroneous interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  It was enacted to give slaves citizenship, not to encourage mestizas to waddle over the border to drop off their spawn, ensuring free benefits and citizenship.  Anchor baby citizenship exists SOLELY through the radical SCOTUS interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and CONGRESS CAN OVERRIDE IT.</p>

		<p>If this law does take effect on Thursday, it will no doubt prove the liberal tag line that &#8220;we can&rsquo;t deport 12 million (or whatever the number is) people&#8221; essentially moot. That&rsquo;s why the Left is so hysterical about this new law taking effect; they know deep down it will prove that attrition through enforcement can be very effective is driving out illegal aliens. And they don&rsquo;t want that because they see these people as future voters for the socialist agenda they so desperately want to enact.  </p>

		<p>Utah will pass a law similar to Arizona&rsquo;s during the next legislative session. There is strong support for it here. I hope the Mexicans realize this and do not make plans to live in Utah.

<p>I&rsquo;m up in Maricopa County and I have been witnessing the same type of astonishing things. About a week ago, I was in Food City (for those who don&rsquo;t know, Food City is a supermarket chain in Arizona that caters to the Hispanic market) and there was a teenage white girl working the register. I have never seen any non-Hispanic workers in any Food City before then. Also, the foreign Hispanic handyman who did maintenance at my apartment complex has disappeared and was replaced by an American white guy - a recovering alcoholic who is trying to get his life back together and far more deserving of that job than some foreign invader. </p>
<p>I think that there might be a major downside to all this, however. I&rsquo;ve been seeing more and more rude, obnoxious blacks here, some wearing gang colors, along with their retarded wigger acolytes. I think they might have heard that the Mexicans are all leaving here and are moving here from California because of it. We&rsquo;ve all read about the ethnic cleansing of blacks by Mexicans in SoCal. Hopefully, however, Joe Arpaio along with our new Alaska carry law will have these folks taken care of soon. </p>

		<p>As a resident of Colorado, I can only hope we get a viable law on our books, too, because if this story is not fabricated, we&rsquo;re due for another wave of enrichment. What an awful thought.<br>
Unfortunately, Colorado has a lot of rather new libtards fromCalifornia, and every other libtard state that ilegals made them uncomfortable in.<br>
Denver is a third world hellhole that looks like Los Angeles did in the 1990s. Everybody is from South of the border.<br>
Can we get our own 1070? I&rsquo;d hope, but I&rsquo;m in some doubt.<br>
But I know a lot of other states will get one going.<br>
I almost feel it&rsquo;s cause to smile!<br>
It&rsquo;s no cure for the forty or fifty million foreign cells that have legally or illegally invaded the body of this society, but it&rsquo;s a start.</p>

		<p>A foreigner&rsquo;s (Brit) observation. Perhaps one of the reasons that Washington is suing Arizona state is that many of the illegals (criminals) will be fleeing to other states, thus forcing them to enact similar laws and then the tail will be wagging the dog as Washington will have lost the initiative.  Americans, there are many like me who love and respect the USA and want you to &#8220;come right&#8221; by sorting out the massive flooding by Third Worlders en masse to Western countries, many with the ultimate objective of taking them over.  They must sort out their own countries first but as we know many are incapable of doing this.  Having lived in Africa, I have experienced the attitude of why work and build up a great country when we can steal what is already established?</p>
<p>Hang on in there guys.  You have the moral rights on your side.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s the only downside here.  The illegals will be flooding into other states and ruining more areas.  The problem is that they are dropping babies all along the way and thus maintaining their racial rise in numbers.  </p>
<p>There are now many latinos (and now blacks!) in the tiny small all white town I grew up in the midwest.  I mean, come on!  There are no farms nearby, no big factories that will hire illegals, no slaughterhouses.  No jobs, even for the local whites.</p>
<p>They come for the welfare benefits, free schools, housing vouchers, food stamps, etc.. and to sell drugs and steal things.  It makes me so sick.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, there were 2 mexican families who moved into my town, and no more after that.  One family was good and their daughter was smart and popular in school.  The other family was gangbanger, with the girl being a slut and the son being a TOTAL thief.  </p>
<p>I personally witnessed him going into K-Mart with a snowmobile suit on and walking out with it stuffed full of goods, and he bragged that he did it all the time.  (Unfortunately, he was a friend of a friend and I interacted with him 2-3 times.)  Last I heard he was in jail for car theft.</p>
<p>I work in a place now in a big urban school that is 100% latino and about 90% illegal.  Most of the kids are nice, but honesty is a concept that is foreign to about half of them.</p>

		<p>Just another sob story as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. Please note the clever way that the authors of these articles always bring up the poor, defenseless FEMALE &#8220;immigrants&#8221; so that people will feel sorry for them. They never, of course, mention the males who commit crimes and have wild beer parties with blaring mariachi music into the wee hours of the morning- even on regular work days, lol. Their modus operandi of trying to get public support for the illegals is SOOO obvious that anyone with half a brain should be able to spot it a mile away.</p>

		<p>  If &#8220;our&#8221; federal government would enforce our laws, it wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary for Arizona to do so. The fact that the illegal lawbreakers are leaving, even before the law is enforced, proves enforcement really works. This refutes the liberal claim that they&rsquo;re too many illegal aliens to deport  &mdash;  they will self deport under strict law enforcement.</p>

		<p>The media are going to generally sit on these kinds of stories because it shows how laws like this work. These people are leaving before the law even goes into effect, and the liberals would have us believe that enforcing immigration is &#8220;impossible&#8221; so the only route is to let them stay. They&rsquo;re lying through their teeth.</p>

You fail to see what is going on. Washington the Obama Administration are Black/Progressive Marxists.They have<br>
stated that they are committed to &#8220;fundamentally change&#8221; the<br>
USA. This means change the culture, and the history and <br>
the identity of the nation. It begins with race replacement.<br>
Our borders are literally war zones..Obama has no concern<br>
with stopping criminal migration. Indeed he wants to destabilize<br>
and terrorize the nation by any means possible. This model has<br>
been followed many times in the Third World..Robert Mugabe,<br>
Jacob Zuma, Juan Peron, Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez. Its nothing less than war on white Europeans and Western Civ.</p>

		<p>Well THIS surely puts the lie to the libtard song about the illegal invaders NOT being able to be deported, NOT being able to afford going back to Mexico, and the lie about their doing jobs whites won&rsquo;t do.  If these illegal alien lawbreakers can DRIVE all the way from Airzona to Pennsylvania, they can CERTAINLY drive from Arizona across the border back to Mexico and home, and STAY THERE.  What arrogance with these leaches and parasites!  It&rsquo;s like the home invader telling the cops, when removed, that they will just go invade and squat in the house next door!  As soon as these invaders leave a job, a white or true American takes it.  Like it used to be.  </p>

<p>It depends on which law the government feels like enforcing. If someone breaks the law crossing the border there are few repercussions.</p>
<p>If someone lights up a cannabis cigarette the <b>full force,</b> of the law applies!</p>
<p>Double standard?</p>

		<p>Actually the 5th amendment is there to ensure innocent people are protected from elements of the law.  It&rsquo;s commonly assumed to be the way criminals cover their tracks, but the 5th is there for innocent people when the law can become unfairly focused.  To say that Only Criminals are Afraid of the Law is pure folly.  As Americans we KNOW the law can be convoluted and twisted with specific purpose through all kinds of deceptive and manipulative tricks of the trade.  While I am not a practicing law breaker, I have seen first hand the zeal to which some law enforcement officers and prosecutors will conduct interviews with streams of leading questions and &#8220;If/Then&#8221; &#8220;Pass/Fail&#8221; kinds of questioning.    I avoid court in ANY direction because I&rsquo;m reasonably certain that it&rsquo;s all in place to extract resources from me no matter if I&rsquo;m the plaintiff or defendant.  Just because you are innocent don&rsquo;t think someone out there can&rsquo;t come up with a creative way to threaten your freedom in an effort to raid your wallet.  This is why I think the stink about Arizona&rsquo;s law is mostly fluff, the cops there have always been able to illegal criminals across the (virtual) fence.  The problem is that Mexico didn&rsquo;t lock them up, they just let them go.  Naturally they jumped the border again, to be on time for work!  It&rsquo;s not a new problem, but the drain on resources caused by illegal border jumpers is finally hitting critical mass.  If white Americans can pull 20% or more of their resources out of the federal system, we can bankrupt ALL of the gimme programs and launch a new age for our nation.  Or, we have to agree to a pull-back region and dig in for the worst of it.<br>
