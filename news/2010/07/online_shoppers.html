<h1><a href="https://www.physorg.com/news198869199.html">Online Shoppers More Likely to Buy From White Sellers Than Black</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Louis Bergeron, PhysOrg.com, July 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Online shoppers are more likely to buy from a white seller than a black one, according to a study by two Stanford researchers who posted ads on local classified advertising websites across the United States.</p>
<p>The ads offered the latest version of the iPod nano for sale, with each ad containing a photo of either a dark- or light-skinned hand holding the popular digital music player. The ads with a black hand received 13 percent fewer responses and 17 percent fewer offers than ads showing a white hand. Black sellers were also offered less money for the iPods than white sellers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were really struck to find as much racial discrimination as we did,&#8221; said Jennifer Doleac, one of the researchers and a doctoral candidate in economics. &#8220;On average it&rsquo;s a younger, more educated group of people shopping online and if anything they probably discriminate less than the population as a whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We suspect that the negative effect of race would be even larger in the general population,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study showed that black sellers were at the greatest disadvantage in the Northeast, where they received 32 percent fewer offers than whites. In the Midwest, black sellers got 23 percent fewer offers, and they got 15 percent fewer in the South. The West was the only region where the difference in the number of offers received by black and white sellers was not statistically significant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The disparity [in the amount of money offered] was most pronounced when the ads were posted in locales with high crime rates or where blacks and whites were geographically isolated from each other.</p>
<p>In general, black sellers were at much less of a disadvantage when the ads were posted in more competitive markets, where larger numbers of iPods were for sale, Doleac said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Doleac and Stein never met with the buyers in person. Instead, when it came time to set up a meeting, the researchers said they were out of town and offered to ship the iPod to a buyer&rsquo;s home, which produced another striking disparity.</p>
<p>Potential buyers corresponding with black sellers were 44 percent less likely to agree to have the iPod shipped to them and were 56 percent more likely to express concern about sending payment to the seller by PayPal.</p>
<p>Doleac and Stein interpreted the buyers&rsquo; reluctance as indicating a lack of trust in the sellers. The would-be buyers were also 17 percent less likely to include their name in emails when they responded to ads placed by black sellers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Because they never met with any of the buyers, Doleac and Stein have no information on the race of the respondents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Regardless of the posted price, the offers received by black sellers were lower than those received by whites. {snip}</p>
<p>The researchers also varied the quality of the writing in the ads, as a way to convey the seller&rsquo;s socioeconomic status.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to see if buyers might discriminate less if they thought it was a highly educated person placing the ad, rather than a person with a low level of education,&#8221; Doleac said. &#8220;But it turns out people just didn&rsquo;t seem to care about the typos in the ads.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Our main finding is that when you completely isolate the effects of race on market outcome, it looks like black sellers do worse,&#8221; Doleac said.</p>

		<p>Maybe most people don&rsquo;t care if an ad has misspellings.  However, I do.  If I see two ads for the same item, and one of them is literate and the other one isn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m more likely to go with the literate-appearing ad, unless there&rsquo;s a big price difference.  I&rsquo;ll overlook a few typos if I really want the item in question, but I try not to buy from people whose ads make them look like morons. </p>

		<p>So, if this keeps up it will result in a sort of reverse &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;. Black stores will be forced to hire white employees&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly not the way it usually works.</p>

		<p>Showing up at an unknown black person&rsquo;s residence with cash in hand to purchase what is highly likely to be stolen electronics? [sarcasm] Nope, no risk of robbery there [sarcasm]. My wife was on a kick buying stuff off of Craigslist for a while. I bought things once in a while, too. Number one rule. Make a telephone call first. Black voice = no meeting to complete the transaction. This was out of concern for personal safety and nothing else. I would go along more make the trip for her when the seller was a male, white or otherwise. White sellers would generally be excluded if it was a ratty neighborhood. There was no concern at all about white women.   </p>

		<p>The experience is the same for real time shopping as well.  I live in an overwhelmingly White town and if you go to the supermarket you&rsquo;ll find diapers with different packaging, one with a White baby and the other black.  Only the diapers with the White baby move off the shelves.  It&rsquo;s the same for other products like cereal or rice.  At the local home improvement store there&rsquo;s a display of charcoal grills with a box of a certain brand of BBQ sauce that has a black cowboy on the bottle.  I&rsquo;ve been passing this display for about a year now and no one has ever taken one of the bottles out of the box.  Last week I think the management tried to use a little psychology by removing half the bottles to make people think others were snapping it up because it was so good.  A year from now that box will probably still be half empty or they&rsquo;ll put the rest of them back.    </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll admit that I&rsquo;ve engaged in discrimination on both sides of the transaction and I&rsquo;m better for it.  I want to reduce the risk that the buyer waste my time by not showing or worse, showing up with less than the negotiated offer.</p>

		<p>Once again preference is being confused with prejudice. A White person might naturally prefer to deal with a fellow White with whom he might have more in common with and feel more comfortable.</p>

		<p>I shop Ebay and you are right, if the person did not make the effort to spell check then I pass that item by. Craigslist and other online sales sites are pretty iffy. I have passed on furniture and other items from blacks. As far as items with pictures of blacks on the packaging certain things like diapers are sized and often you have almost no choice unless you switch brands or buy another size. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll bet the blacks prefer to buy from a white as well.</p>
<p>My ex-husband was a financial planner.  I was surprised when he told me that blacks looking for an investment manager preferred whites.  Apparently, they have a low level of trust in their brothers.</p>
<p>I would buy a used phone from somebody black or white if I already knew them, but I would NOT buy from a black otherwise.  I would be afraid that it was stolen, or defective, or that information gleaned about me during the course of the transaction would be used to victimize me later.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Because they never met with any of the buyers, Doleac and Stein have no information on the race of the respondents.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the most revealing passage in this whole piece.  The intended effect of this hare-brained, half-baked study seems to be to paint the picture in the mind of the reader that it&rsquo;s WHITE shoppers that caused this outcome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to guarantee these &#8220;researchers&#8221; set out on this project assuming they&rsquo;d get this result.  They assume the fact that their study turned out the way they expected proves the inherent white racism they already &#8220;knew&#8221; existed in society.</p>
<p>The only problem with this &#8220;study&#8221; is that it ignores the very real fact that a number of BLACK people don&rsquo;t like to deal with their own race, because, well, every gang banger, crack addict, and general ne&rsquo;er-do-well in the black community is some other black&rsquo;s brother, sister, mother, father, etc.  </p>
<p>Just like the study that came out a few years ago showing that women prefer to have a male supervisor than a female supervisor.  No one hates women like other women.  They tried to explain away and sweep this under the rug also, saying it&rsquo;s because of cultural signals that trick women into thinking they don&rsquo;t make good bosses.  But we all know the truth.  No one wants a catty vindictive broad for a supervisor, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>The point is, they know one another even better than we know them.  And when you remove the white man from the equation they have no problem openly discussing the shortcomings of their race at face value.  All people do this, they&rsquo;ll quarrel amongst themselves but when you throw in an outsider (whites in this case) they rally together to oppose the outsider, regardless of the truth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put it this way: a guy I&rsquo;ve known for years, who is black, tells me he tries to avoid hiring blacks as much as possible and any time he&rsquo;s looking at a new apartment he drives through the complex at different hours of the day counting the black folks.  If there are too many he looks elsewhere.  </p>
<p>Even the smarter and more productive elements of the black community don&rsquo;t trust the members of their own race.  When you grow up and live around black people long enough, I don&rsquo;t care what color you are, any intelligent person of any shade of the rainbow will see the truth.   If that&rsquo;s not telling of reality I don&rsquo;t know what is. </p>

		<p>The issue of black versus white hasn&rsquo;t come up for me on eBay.  Frankly, I have no idea what the skin color of the seller of any particular item is, unless the seller is stupid enough to mention it.  </p>
<p>Now, were I to buy something in person, that&rsquo;d be different.  For many reasons, I&rsquo;m just not going to a ghetto neighborhood to buy an item.</p>

#8 anonymous asks:</p>
<p>&#8220;Are white populations in the Northeast more conservative and racially aware than in other parts of the US&#8221;???</p>
<p>Absolutely,</p>
<p>What race you are strongly influences what demographic you live in. Northeastern minority populations(esp. blacks), are highly concentrated within urban centers, while affluent suburbs and rural areas usually remain overwhelmingly white. History, social forces and economics play major roles as to why this is so. </p>

		<p>Now what?  Will we have to buy a certain number of &#8216;black books&rsquo; for every white book we buy?  Will the incessant whining and crybaby fest from blacks ever stop?  If blacks are a strong race, then prove it by stopping the whining, stopping the victimhood status, stop by sleeping around with multiple partners, stop joining gangs, and start working hard, being responsible, and quit acting like the (white) world owes you.</p>

		<p>This is truly a shocking revelation. To think that people shopping online would prefer to deal with white sellers.  I can&rsquo;t imagine their reasons.  I mean, just because the item has a high likelihood of being stolen, broken, or misrepresented are hardly reasons to be hesitant about buying from blacks.  And what&rsquo;s the danger in giving a black seller your home address?  What could happen?  And why would anybody be reluctant to go into da hood to pick up the item?  After all, concealed carry permits are easy to get in most states now.</p>
<p>These are all just further examples of white paranoia and racism. </p>

		<p>None of these problems would exist if white people were allowed the CHOICE of whether to live in a &#8216;multicultural&rsquo; environment or not.<br>
Of course, if we were given the choice, MOST of us would choose to live in an all white country&hellip; so instead we have &#8216;diversity&rsquo; FORCED on us. By who?</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t white people allowed to have their own countries any more?</p>

<p>Gladly,</p>
<p> Get started by typing in the title &#8220;BETWEEN BOSTON &amp; NEW YORK&#8221; in the search engine of your choice. This was an interview narrative conducted by CPTV in 1992 about life in Connecticut involving it&rsquo;s history, culture racial attitudes,defacto segregation and related matters. The people being interviewed run the gamit from state historians, authors, public officials, and the editior of Ct. magazine. IMO, this is the absolute best, condensed, indepth representation of a Northeastern (white), regional view, about the subject at hand.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ll read in regards to whites on race, is largely applicable to the northeast region as a whole.</p>
<p>FYI  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ve live in three states in the northeast all my life until several years ago. Connecticut was one of them.</p>
<p>I hope it&rsquo;ll be of some help.</p>

		<p>It is not so much black vs white on Ebay it has more to do with how professional the listing looks. For anyone who has not sold an item on Ebay there is a spell check button where you can be sure that you do not have every other word mispelled before you list your item. </p>

		<p>More stellar work from young white Stanford Economic doctorate candidates. And such an intellectually lazy way to score points with the University and guarantee that your thesis is accepted:  there is economic racism against dark skinned people.<br>
Ground breaking!  And it&rsquo;s even on the internet! Call Eric Holder! </p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t Racist Until They Made Me is right, the fact that the race of the buyers is not known is very telling.  The overall feel of the article is that whites are behind this inequality, but there is no proof of that.  It&rsquo;s insinuated by the terms young and educated, code words for whites and asians.  </p>
<p>It must be very frustrating for liberals, especially after years of programming the population with images of minority doctors, presidents, heroes, gods and angels.  Still, white racism somehow seeps out through the aether and infects everybody.  That&rsquo;s what they should be studying.</p>

		<p><i> &#8220;after Canada&rsquo;s immigration policy was radically changed by the Liberal Party in 1965  &mdash;  a matter of mere months after America&rsquo;s was  &mdash;  the new, nonwhite immigrants immediately came flooding in.</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>That above sentence stood out for me.  It&rsquo;s worth saving. It illustrates how the immigration policies of ALL THE WHITE COUNTRIES were very quickly transformed within a very short time frame right after that   &mdash;   Sweden, France, Australia, etc.  Countries that had never been open to immigration before, were suddenly thrown open to immigration and became multicultural/multiracial.</p>
<p>As  has been written here by others before,  THIS WAS ORCHESTRATED!  THIS IS NO ACCIDENT! </p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p><br>
White Australia policy: After 1965, however, this policy began to change.  By the 1970s, Australia had abandoned the system of racial preferences, and Asian immigration rapidly increased.<br>
https://tinyurl.com/387hr5f</p>
<p>In March 1966,  after a review of the  [European only immigration]  policy,  Immigration Minister Opperman announced applications for migration would be accepted from well-qualified people on the basis of their suitability&hellip;. At the same time, the Holt Liberal government decided a number of &#8220;temporary resident&#8221; non-Europeans who could become permanent residents and citizens after five years  (the same as for Europeans).  As a result, annual non-European settler arrivals rose from 746 in 1966 to 2,696 in 1971, while annual part-European settler arrivals rose from 1,498 to 6,054.</p>
