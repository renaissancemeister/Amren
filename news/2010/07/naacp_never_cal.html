<h1><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0710/39783.html">NAACP: Never Called Tea Party &#8216;Racist&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andy Barr, Politico, July 15 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>NAACP President Ben Jealous said Thursday that the resolution passed by the group on Wednesday does not call the tea party &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The resolution the NAACP approved Wednesday at its annual conference in Kansas City, Mo., alleges that the tea party has used racial epithets against President Barack Obama and has verbally and physically abused African-American members of Congress.</p>
<p>A portion of the resolution does indeed characterize the behavior as &#8220;racist,&#8221; but Jealous said Thursday during an interview on MSNBC&rsquo;s &#8220;Morning Joe&#8221; that the resolution was not intended to condemn the entire movement as such.</p>
<p>&#8220;We aren&rsquo;t saying that the tea party is racist,&#8221; Jealous said. &#8220;What we&rsquo;re saying is that with their increasing power comes an increasing responsibility to act responsibly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and to call out when they see those things on those signs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jealous argued that racist groups have embraced the tea party movement and said that what the NAACP would like to see is one of the movement&rsquo;s leaders  &mdash;  whether it be former House Majority Leader Dick Armey or former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin  &mdash;  denounce those elements of the tea party.</p>
<p>&#8220;These sort of KKK-type groups saying they like the tea party and want to be a part of it, it would just seem someone would call out and say we don&rsquo;t want them to be a part of it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Asked if he thought members of the tea party are racially insensitive, Jealous responded: &#8220;No, not at all.&#8221;</p>

		<p>We couldn&rsquo;t have done a better job than the NAACP in waking up a few more White Americans to the threats surrounding them.  If we could, we would organize a fund raising job to pay the NAACP to ratchet it up a notch by preemptively declaring that any White Candidate who dares run against Obama in the Dem. primaries is automatically a Racist!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Tea Partiers don&rsquo;t know how to respond. They should have said, &#8220;Well, under at least one of the top ten definitions that blacks use for &#8216;racist,&rsquo;  I&rsquo;m sure we fall under at least one or two, and do you if you have White Skin. I you are White and cherish your freedom to pursue life, liberty, property, and happiness, you are a racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Can you feel the change coming?  Our DAY OF RACIAL RECKONING quickens its arrival.</p>

		<p>I think the great fear on the part of the NAACP toward the Tea Party Movement is that the TPM is The Great Unknown, IOW, an &#8220;enemy&#8221; so asymmetrical and unlike themselves that they can&rsquo;t understand it.  It&rsquo;s sorta like our fear of Al Qaeda, or like a despot&rsquo;s fear of the internet, because the TPM, AQ and the internet, while worlds apart in most ways, are alike in that there&rsquo;s no such thing as a World HQ, no omnibus CEO, no Weberian power structure, no central artery or choke point of money, recruiting, data, bandwidth, information etc. that is susceptible to being choked off such that it would be fatal to the body as a whole.</p>
<p>Just as the internet is a network of networks, the TPM and AQ are very loose and relatively leaderless confederations of relatively like-minded individuals and smaller groups, that may lionize a certain few strong individuals (OBL, Sarah Palin, respectively), but would survive and thrive in their absence, as the aforementioned individuals are not CEOs, or central nervous systems.  </p>
<p>For the NAACP to think that Dick Armey or Sarah Palin can make the TPM do anything is actually an indicator of the NAACP&rsquo;s own self, i.e. the typical, old-fashioned organization with a corporate power structure, and one that has a few reliable money streams, and one that goes out of business with only a few changes in public policy. </p>

		<p>You know those people have abused the term racist so much in the past twenty years it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything anymore (at least to me).<br>
The NAACP has out lived it&rsquo;s usefulness and is now just a victim &#8220;Blackmail&#8221; organization, and the liberal media jumps when they bark.<br>
Talk about a racist organization that should &#8220;admit&#8221; that they are racist!</p>

<p>Both of which are lies.</p>
<p>They further charged that black Congressmen were spit on and called the &#8220;n&#8221; word which has been proven false by no less than a half dozen people, one of which offered $100,000 for information from anybody revealing the charges to be true.  There were no takers.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that this tax free organization is in violation of its tax exempt status just as the SPLC and the ADL are.  That they continue to operate without being taxed reveals the stark corruption in Congress and, especially, the IRS, which is no more than a political arm in and of itself.</p>
<p>The NAACP is no more than a shakedown organization that is steeped in partisan politics and should be disbanded, because of the unscrupulous behavior of its leadership and members.</p>
<p>Like most everything black, it is rife with liars and cry baby members.</p>

		<p> Why didn&rsquo;t the interviewer ask Ben Jealous to define what he meant by &#8220;KKK-type groups&#8221; that allegedly have voiced support for the Tea Party Movement? Oh, I forgot   &mdash;   he was on MSNBC, which is not going to spoil a good swipe at conservatives by asking inconvenient questions.</p>
<p> The leader of the NAACP, one of the biggest shakedown organizations in the country, is a great one to be calling for the Tea Party leaders to &#8220;act responsibly,&#8221; isn&rsquo;t he? And, by the way, from the looks of him, I wonder how many White grandparents Ben Jealous had? I&rsquo;d say two, minimum; three, more likely. But, of course, he&rsquo;s &#8220;African American.&#8221; Yeah, and my one-eighth Cherokee ancestry makes me a full-fledged Indian.</p>

		<p>I would like to see the NAACP formally denounce its many, many members who have been convicted of drug possession, non-payment of child support, corruption, robbery, assault, burglary, rape, or murder, or who are former or current gang members.  </p>
<p>The NAACP is an hypocritical, racist, and self-serving organization whose primary purpose is to advance one race over other races (even though they claim that race does &#8220;not exist&#8221;).  The NAACP is the last organization who should be calling the kettle black.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;If I said Africa was racist, and they needed to import millions of non-Africans to make a blended humanity, how fast would the NAACP say that&rsquo;s racist genocide, the Final Solution for black people?  Well, I want White people to survive in ____, and our population dwindled each generation due to non-White immigration.  A blended humanity is genocide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;NAACP denies civil rights to White people, that&rsquo;s racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;White people have every right to organize political action.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you hate Whites so much, why do you want to live in White neighborhoods and live off White taxes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You call me racist when the Black Panthers want to murder White babies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You call the Tea Party racist, when the NAACP exists SOLELY to help out black people?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not a racist, I&rsquo;m just speaking for White interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not a racist, you&rsquo;re just saying that because I&rsquo;m White.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Calling the Tea Party racist shows that the word doesn&rsquo;t mean anything anymore  &mdash;   it&rsquo;s a way to shut up White people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re the racist, not me.  You want to take away civil rights of White people, and you want the genocide of White people  &mdash;   YOU are the racist, and you should be ashamed of yourself.&#8221;</p>

		<p>To this present day nobody in the NAACP or otherwise can produce anything about the &#8220;racist elements&#8221; in the Tea Party that they are talking about. Among the endless videos and audio we have seen and heard concerning the Tea Party Movement we have yet to see any racist signs or hear any hate speech whatsoever. We constantly hear about the black congressmen that were spit upon and called the &#8220;N&#8221; word yet there is no video or audio to back up what was obviously a outright lie. If by any slight chance racist signs or hate speech can be produced by video or audio you can bet that fraudulent activity would be perpetrated at the hands of Jason Levin or SEIU thugs that have already admitted that they would try and infiltrate the Tea Party and use these cheap tactics to try and make the Tea Party members look bad.</p>
<p>   The audacity, arrogance, and hypocrisy of the NAACP, Michelle Obama and all that were there at the meeting to dare ask Tea Party Leaders to denounce any racist elements that may be in the Movement is infuriating, especially when a Black Panther leader says in public on video and audio &#8220;I hate all whites, we need to kill all crackers and cracker babies&#8221; which was presented on Fox News just days before the NAACP meeting.  The Black Panthers are now threatening violence against Glen Beck at a big Tea Party event on August 28.  The Panthers said &#8220;Glen Beck attacked us and we are going to visit him at the Tea Party&#8221;.  How is that for &#8220;twisted&#8221;? I guess the Black Panthers wanting to commit genocide on white people is not considered an attack, but somebody playing a video of all that hate speech is the attacker. When we hear the NAACP and the Obamas denounce the hate speech and racist violence of the Black Panthers there is no reason to even listen to their meaningless lies and dribble.                </p>

Most blacks harbor a dictatorial drive to have absolute power to crush their enemies. Many believed that when President Obama was elected, he would use this power to defeat the white man and transfer the wealth and power the white man selfishly hoards for himself and give it to blacks.</p>
<p>All the Tea Party has to do is stay on message; it&rsquo;s a group protesting over taxation. Anyone who believes they&rsquo;re being over taxed is free to join.</p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t join because blacks believe whites aren&rsquo;t taxed enough. </p>

		<p> What I don&rsquo;t understand is why the TP and Whites in general worry about what black people think of them. Take it from me, non-Whites don&rsquo;t care what we think. Blacks always get a good laugh when they can get White folks to argue amongst themselves about them. DON&rsquo;T FALL FOR IT!! It gives them a sense of importance.<br>
 I also noticed that Mr. Jealous has alot of White blood in him, and in fact has a White father. I&rsquo;m sure his White father is so proud to have raised a black bigot. It has been my experience that the most &#8216;racisss&rsquo; blacks are usually light skinned. Not to say that I havent had run-ins with dark skinned blacks, it just seems that the majority of my run-ins have been with light skinned blacks.<br>
 Bottom line - the TP should tell blacks that accuse them of racism what I say when I&rsquo;m accused, &#8220;well you&rsquo;re entitled to your opinion&#8221;.      </p>

		<p>The irony is the Tea Party IS, in fact &#8220;racist&#8221;.  Everything they are for, and everything they are against, is about race.  Just as in decades past, conservativism is trying to address these things while not admitting race is really the issue.  In the past, that has resulted in nothing but hypocrisy and failure.</p>
<p>This time, however, it is more &#8220;in your face&#8221; than ever that this is about race.  Further, it has never been more open that non-whites are the ones who hold views of racist hate and engage, regularly in anti-white racist violence.  They are also, more than ever, putting things in terms of divesting whites of property, living space and life itself.</p>
<p>Such conditions, displayed in this specific instance, make it impossible for the &#8220;Tea Party&#8221; to dodge or ignore the race issue.  In fact, a rather large number are race realists, newly awakened whites, even white nationalists, testing the viability of the Tea Party as an emerging white race political entity.</p>

		<p>5 ranger:  James Edwards has been trying to drive this point home for months and years:  The NAACP and other groups will always say things like that, even in the absence of proof.  The only proof they need is that there are three or more white people in one place.  &#8220;Racist&#8221; means being white, pure and simple.  Remember, the only good honkey is a dead honkey.</p>
<p>6 Wayne Engle:  To your first question, I think he means the Council of Conservative Citizens, which, according to its National blog, has been a co-sponsoring organization at a few tea party rallies in a few places.  </p>
<p>12 Tom S.:  That&rsquo;s my experience, too.  I think the psychology of the mulatto is that they&rsquo;re smarter than the average black, so they can mull things over a little bit, but since they&rsquo;re part black, they&rsquo;re really not that smart, but smart enough to think they&rsquo;re a lot smarter than they actually are.  IOW, smart enough to care, but too dumb to know the difference.  Since THEY are only part white, they&rsquo;re not really white.  And since THEY can&rsquo;t be white, then nobody else should be allowed to be white, either.</p>

<p>Somebody forgot to tell them not to cry wolf.</p>
<p>We need to expose their double standard of what racism is. White Democrats have been trying to contain the double standards of groups like the NAACP for a long time. Once these double standards start to become better know to the public and actualised I think the nature of racial debate can change.  </p>

<p>By that picture, I wouldn&rsquo;t even guess him to be &#8220;black&#8221;!<br>
Not even an octroon.  Maybe 1/16th, at most???</p>
<p>The only give-away is his poor letter writing skill, unless those lettters are written for him by a black underling - which is quite possible.</p>
<p>The problem with &#8220;high-yallers&#8221; like him (and he&rsquo;s extremely high) is that they have to work extra hard to fit in with the other, uh, &#8220;blacks&#8221;. So they have to be Super-black and hate whitey extra, extra much in order to compensate for so little blackness.  They are really tragic cases, when you come down to it, fitting in nowhere but always trying, always having to prove themselves, always being doubted. </p>
<p>But having him as president of the NAACP is really joke (which the blacks don&rsquo;t get).  Is there no real black person available who could handle it?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a point I like to make: If a word means whatever anyone wants it to mean, then it&rsquo;s essentially meaningless.  &#8220;Racist&#8221; today is merely a device to shut down conversation, &amp; a pretty useless one at that, since the arguments about race never end. </p>

		<p>The NAACP is publicly in a poltical alliance with LA RAZA-THE RACE-working on political issues that promote the racial interests of the LA RAZA-THE RACE.</p>
<p> The Tea Partiers have conceded the racial transformation of America issue to blacks and high fertility post-1965 nonwhites. This is the fundamental flaw in all libertarian-free market fanatic political movements. This is the fundamental reason why they are doomed to fail.</p>
<p>By conceding the racial transformation issue to black and high fertility nonwhites, the new racial majority guarantees the end of libertarian political movements.</p>
<p>Libertarian-free market political movements are just doomed to fail. These political movements  contain the seeds of their own destruction. The Tea Partiers are basically the  libertarian movement that does recognize that Native Born White Americans have any legitimate racial interest.  worth defending. This is because libertarian free market fanatics have reduced Native Born White Americans to nothing more than small component in a vast free market network of economic transactions. But if Native Born White Americans have no racial identity, they have no legitimate racial interests&hellip;therefore, since there is no reality outside the free market..Native Born White Americans do not exist&hellip;.therefore, the spectacle of the Tea Partiers chanting &#8220;free markets!!!!..The Constitution!!!&#8221; in the face of high fertility post-1965 Whites who publicly state &#8220;WE are going race replace Native Born White Americans!!! </p>
<p>The Tea Partiers and Libertarians in general are utterly worthless  .Check out the recent discussion over at Occidental Dissent about the Tea Party and the Libertarians.</p>

<p>I have read that the NAACP has been criticized by some blacks  for not changing its name to a more modern one, eliminating the once-delicate reference to &#8220;Colored People&#8221;&hellip; since blacks have now become defiantly black and they no make denials about it. In fact, we have the absurdity of people who are almost entirely white, such as its current president, stridently insisting that they are  black.</p>
<p>The NAACP response to that criticism is that they represent ALL COLORED PEOPLE, not just blacks.   Therefore, that broad mandate  would take in Mexicans, and well&hellip;.uh, let&rsquo;s just say anyone who considers themselves to be other-than-completely white, and we&rsquo;ll just leave it at that.</p>
<p>In other words, when expressed that way, they represent EVERYONE who is not white or fully white.  They are therefore an anti-white coalition aimed at undermining, distablishing and destroying  whites in this country   &mdash;  - and only whites. Thus they have, by their title, established that whites are their enemy, their ONLY enemy, and that they, representing all colored people, are the enemy of all white people.  Who else?</p>
<p>Despite all the mealymouth talk about love, brotherhood, racial harmoney, etc., the ONLY group they target their efforts at is white people.  Without white people to attack, shake down, mooch off, slander and criticize, they would have no purpose for existence. </p>

If the Tea Party needs to get rid of &#8220;racist&#8221; elements, then so does La Raza who advocates violently taking back the Southwest and &#8220;kicking out all the gringos.&#8221;  If the Tea Party needs to get rid of &#8220;racist&#8221; elements, then so does the Black Panther Party and the Nation of Islam for advocating and even carrying out acts of violence against whites and every other &#8216;enemy&rsquo; of blacks.</p>

		<p>There is an interesting point to be observed in this NAACP instigated back and forth with the Tea Party.  And a method we should adopt.  It is TRUE that the NAACP called the entire Tea Party &#8220;racist&#8221;.  But when the Tea Party, fed up with the race hustlers and knowing the lie of their charge, STOOD UP TO THEM and threw it right back in their face, the NAACP backed off a tad.  Suddenly &#8220;not all&#8221; tea partiers are &#8220;racist&#8221; only some and then comes the demand to throw out those &#8220;few&#8221; who are &#8220;racist&#8221;.  The Tea Party should stand firm, refuse to buckle, and throw THAT right back in the face of the NAACP, charging THEIR WHOLE ORGANIZATION AS RACIST, and pointing to their very name as overt proof.  They should then state clearly that they will no longer give NAACP any credence nor rise to any further of their lies and charges.  They should then say that their platform has nothing to do about race, but about bad government, bad leaders, bad debt, bad credit, marxism taking over the country, allies treated as enemies and enemies treated as friends, people engaged in illegal immigration as legitimate and those trying to enforce laws on the books as lawbreakers, and finally the whole Orwellian scheme of turning lie into truth and truth into lie as an overall agenda.  That is what the Tea Party is fighting against. Then lastly, tell the NAACP if they object to the Tea Party, it must be because they are engaged in all or most of all that.  Then have nothing more to say to them, or about them and treat them as the irrelevant race hustlers they are.  You can see what happens when back people are faced down instead of caved in to with quivering cowardice - they begin to back down.  Whether it be one on one, or one black organization against one strong and righteous White organization.    It&rsquo;s time to put the race hustlers, all of them, in their place with the contempt they deserve.  The Tea Party just began that process.  Let&rsquo;s keep it up!</p>

		<p>Of course, the  <b>true</b> meaning of the word - racism is simply the inherent mechanism that drives the natural and normal survival instinct in every race, having nothing to do with hate and/or prejudice at all. </p>
<p>Re-education directed away from Cultural Marxist ideology is what is badly needed and parents everywhere ought to start taking the lead by instructing their children along said lines.  Precisely because it can&rsquo;t be done through the present Communist-controlled Western education system, it has to be done privately both in individual and group format.  </p>
<p>Ethnonationalist organisations might like to look at methods of structuring a system that involves pooling their knowledge, experience and professional expertise for the purpose of composing and providing educative literature for distribution, and also holding training seminars/open meetings for the public who would collectively support their local branches though entry/membership fees and general fund-raising efforts.<br>

<p>Who&rsquo;s going to educate the parents?  There&rsquo;s not a handful in the Western world that would have any idea of what you are talking about.</p>
<p>This insanity in existence right now is too firmly entrenched to ever change through an expectation that passing along revelations will reverse the Cultural Marxist influence.</p>
<p>The best thing to do is nothing.  Yes, nothing.  Except, of course prepare for defense and survival.</p>
<p>Why?  Because the present situation is imploding all on its own and has been since it was first disseminated throughout the country many years ago. But, now it has reached critical mass.  It is an unsound concept, destined to fail as it has many times throughout history.  The result is going to be civil upheaval throughout the Western world that will bring about changes.  It&rsquo;s too late to win the war of ideas, especially by way of passing along information from one person to another.</p>
<p>We hear much from people who laud a &#8220;free&#8221; system of government, like the US, but the US has never been free.  Whether it marched off to war or adapted a collective opinion about someone, some group, or some thing, it has been the result of psychologically brainwashing the people into believing what the government or those behind the organs of communication want them to believe&hellip;or some other insidious group that wants to change public opinion to think in terms similar to their own.  It is this &#8220;free&#8221; society that allows unsavory elements to gain the power to mold public thought and opinion.</p>
<p>As it stands now, the concept of diversity and multiculturalism/multiracialism that has been hammered into the minds of the people is one that cannot endure simply because it goes against human nature and instincts.  Left to their own, people will be homogeneous in everything they do.  </p>
<p>This present situation, like similar kinds of unstable concepts throughout history, will only be altered by civil war, as history has shown us many times.  The organs of communication are now controlled by those with an unsound ideology, while we slept.  &#8220;Enlightening&#8221; the public about the situation will only result in blank stares, unless the ability to communicate via the mass media somehow falls into the hands of people who are really aware of what is going on, and that won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>The only thing that parents today might pass along to their children is ignorance.  People in a &#8220;free,&#8221; capitalist society are so engrossed in survival and other important matters they do not have the time or energy for eternal vigilance, which is an ABSOLUTE necessity to keep out clever disseminators of hate, who want to change things to be more in line with their perverted, and often paranoid, concepts. </p>

		<p>Since the NAACP has an expressly racial agenda - it says so right in the name they chose for themselves, it seems quite hypocritical for them to criticize others who also have a racial agenda.  Unfortunately, a certain level of intelligence is apparently required to appreciate a concept as subtle as irony.  Do we know who is lacking in this respect?  <br>

<p>Hey, the same issues are there as 1776&hellip;i.e. high taxes, contintual foreign wars &amp; bureaucrats traveling the land to harass the people.  It&rsquo;s really a great read &amp; I recommend it cause it could be our home town one day &amp; us taking a stand. Great read!<br>

		<p>Of course, the NAACP calling ANYONE &#8220;raciss&#8221; is hilarious.<br>
But they have put themselves in a catch-22, methinks.<br>
&#8220;Pecunia non olet&#8221;, Diocletian defended the tax he levied on public privies. If money has no odour it is safe to assume it has no colour either.<br>
Therefore, if they want to call a tax protest movement &#8220;raciss&#8221; they first have to publicly declare their constituency to be parasites.<br>
This, IMHO, is the only reason they backed off (somewhat) and it should be exploited to the fullest.</p>

<p>That &#8216;handful&rsquo; is rapidly growing throughout the West with the help of various ethnic-orientated organisations, some a little more explicit and some implicit. Likewise, several Western countries are ahead in ethnic awareness while others are still in their infancy, those others being them which haven&rsquo;t experienced a sufficient measure of <i>multiculturalism</i> and <i>diversity</i> just yet.</p>
<p>Educating the parents falls on the growing legions of ethnically aware activists both on the ground and on the Internet.  Trust me, White inhabitants <b>are</b> opening their eyes and correctly equating their present collective downward spiral with the criminally engineered political transfer of power and wealth from the White camp to the non-White, <b>and</b> by further obvious signs of the same gameplan, ie, from the West to the Third World.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;This insanity in existence right now is too firmly entrenched to ever change through an expectation that passing along revelations will reverse the Cultural Marxist influence.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Not so!<br>
  <br>
<b>No</b> political ideology or theology whether benign or harmful, is ever too firmly entrenched and allegedly too powerful to be uprooted and discarded. History will attest to that point.   All it takes is a drastic fall in the good fortunes of significant sections of a population especially one that is accompanied by racially/culturally aimed persecution, to commence the process of collapse.  Unfortunately, where Westerners are concerned as a rule, spiritual wellbeing plays little or no part in the process.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The best thing to do is nothing. Yes, nothing. Except, of course prepare for defense and survival.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>In that case, defence and survival of what?  Unless a peoples have been made previously aware of <b>who they are</b>, their present predicament and the causes of it, they&rsquo;re not likely to direct their struggle at their own actual ethnic survival and that of their civilisation.  See my previous comment about whom educating the parents falls upon.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Why? Because the present situation is imploding all on its own and has been since it was first disseminated throughout the country many years ago. But, now it has reached critical mass. It is an unsound concept, destined to fail as it has many times throughout history. The result is going to be civil upheaval throughout the Western world that will bring about changes.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I tend to agree with you on your last comment regarding <i>civil upheaval</i> which is, furthermore, why ethnic European-inspired organisations are springing up all over the West replete with the provision of copious varieties of educative material both via the Internet, eg, community websites link-building and at ground level too, in an attempt to get ahead of this likelihood.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;It&rsquo;s too late to win the war of ideas, especially by way of passing along information from one person to another.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Winning the war of ideas can manifest in more than one form. A slow march through the institutions is fine in stable and comparatively contented societies as was the era of the 1960s\1970s, particularly being the era in which the poisonous roots of the present ideology were <b>successfully</b> sown and nurtured.</p>
<p>However, when time is of the essence quick reality checks can do the job just as well.  Yes, some will have to be dragged kicking and screaming just as were to be found during the slow march method.  </p>
<p><i>&#8220;We hear much from people who laud a &ldquo;free&rdquo; system of government, like the US, but the US has never been free.

It is this &ldquo;free&rdquo; society that allows unsavory elements to gain the power to mold public thought and opinion.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This is not going to alter whatever the era we live in because Man&rsquo;s innate survival instinct is basically tribal and thus contemporarily, racial and cultural.  It&rsquo;s simply an expression of what is the ongoing and ever-changing evoluntionary psychological dimension of Man himself in his individual ethnic fight for survival.</p>
<p><i><b>&#8220;As it stands now, the concept of diversity and multiculturalism/multiracialism that has been hammered into the minds of the people is one that cannot endure simply because it goes against human nature and instincts.

<p>You said it - correctly so!</p>
<p><i>&#8220;This present situation, like similar kinds of unstable concepts throughout history, will only be altered by civil war, as history has shown us many times.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Civil War in and of itself is not guaranteed to result in victory for the currently oppressed element of society which is why heavy preparation has to be undertaken behind the scenes in the hope they the outcome will bode well for one&rsquo;s own. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;The organs of communication are now controlled by those with an unsound ideology, while we slept&#8221;</i></p>
<p>For the moment only!  The nnsound ideologies of those pedalling them, have a habit of losing their footings and crumbling to pieces!!</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; unless the ability to communicate via the mass media somehow falls into the hands of people who are really aware of what is going on, and that won&rsquo;t happen.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already happening in unexpected ways, chiefly with the help of the alternative media - the Internet.</p>
<p>You are forgetting that over 50% of the West&rsquo;s population have access to the Internet.  We can take it as a certainty, rapidly increasing numbers are seeking out the relevant information for themselves as well as being directed by others to ethnonationalist website links via community websites, eg, Facebook and these community websites just happen to also attract predominately, the young and pre middle-aged.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The only thing that parents today might pass along to their children is ignorance. People in a &ldquo;free,&rdquo; capitalist society are so engrossed in survival and other important matters they do not have the time or energy for eternal vigilance, which is an ABSOLUTE necessity to keep out clever disseminators of hate, who want to change things to be more in line with their perverted, and often paranoid, concepts.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>All societies change for the better or worse.  The current one is merely a passing phase.  As it continues its downward spiral, the present apathy of the masses will undergo a rude awakening, definitely along ethnic lines, of which there&rsquo;s absolutely no doubt. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the anti-White/anti-Western civilisation hate-fuelled Left and its multitude of enabled attack dogs have set the groundwork already.</p>

<p><br>
Swain and a few other dreamers here keep saying this, but I very much doubt it will happen that way. Not as America is presently  constituted.  Why not?  Because, whatever troubles come, Americans have been so brainwashed over most of their lives that they are (most of them) unable to think in racial terms; and no matter how great the difficulties they may face, they will reject any racial solution as something wicked and shameful. It will be their knee-jerk reaction.  It&rsquo;s been drilled into them. </p>
<p>Maybe we Amreners can see things racialy, but let&rsquo;s face it   &mdash;   we&rsquo;re a minority, most Americans cannot. To do so would require an entire, massive re-education program for the whole American populace. And it&rsquo;s not going to be easy to un-do an entire lifetime of indoctrination. And this is assuming even if the media and educational establishments went along (which seems extremely improbable). </p>
<p>No, I think that even if the USA breaks into smaller units (which is possible), they will NOT be explicitly racial, and they will still contain the same racial problems that people refuse to see.  A few of us do, but the majority do not.</p>
