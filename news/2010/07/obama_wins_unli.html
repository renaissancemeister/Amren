<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/us/politics/19evangelicals.html">Obama Wins Unlikely Allies in Immigration</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laurie Goodstein, New York Times, July 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At a time when the prospects for immigration overhaul seem most dim, supporters have unleashed a secret weapon: a group of influential evangelical Christian leaders.</p>
<p>Normally on the opposite side of political issues backed by the Obama White House, these leaders are aligning with the president to support an overhaul that would include some path to legalization for illegal immigrants already here. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although other religious leaders have long favored immigration overhaul  &mdash;  including Roman Catholics, mainline Protestants, Jews and Muslims  &mdash;  the evangelicals are crucial because they have the relationships and the pull with Republicans.</p>

		<p>To b e fair, I think the rank-and-file evangelicals do not want immigration reform.</p>
<p>However, leaders are leaders, and are there for a reason.</p>
<p>That is why I no longer claim to be a Christian  &mdash;  the leaders are unpredictable, and sometimes treacherous; and the rank and file, while good people, are clueless about why they believe what they believe &hellip; and also what their &#8220;shepherds&#8221; believe. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not a surprise to me   &mdash;   Conservative Christian movement leaders have been for open immigration and open borders for as long as I can remember.  Part of it is practical   &mdash;   looking for new converts, but part of it is that they&rsquo;re egalitarians and Lincolnians at heart, and they can&rsquo;t call for closed borders because of the race issue.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Although other religious leaders have long favored immigration overhaul&#8221; - I think this is the key phrase in this article.  I find almost no rank-and-file member of any church supporting mass-immigration of third worlders into America.  The Leadership wants it in order to refill the pews and give themselves a false sense of usefulness.  Muslims are in favor as they see any third world immigrant as assisting in the fall of America.  In any case, check off &#8220;Evangelical Leaders&#8221; as another group that will not be welcome in our part of the U.S. breakup.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Hispanics are religious, family-oriented, pro-life, entrepreneurial,&rdquo; said the Rev. Richard D. Land, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, the Southern Baptist Convention&rsquo;s public policy arm. &ldquo;They are hard-wired social conservatives, unless they&rsquo;re driven away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some older conservative leaders say: &lsquo;Richard, stop this. You&rsquo;re going to split the conservative coalition,&rsquo; &rdquo; Dr. Land continued. &ldquo;I say it might split the old conservative coalition, but it won&rsquo;t split the new one. And if the new one is going to be a governing coalition, it&rsquo;s going to have to have a lot of Hispanics in it. And you don&rsquo;t get a lot of Hispanics in your coalition by engaging in anti-Hispanic anti-immigration rhetoric.&rdquo; </p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>Richard Land is an out and out race traitor and this proves it. I listened to his show last week and could not believe the stuff he was spouting. I left a comment on his site and the article awhile back that showed what he believes about these illegals. He wants MORE &#8220;hispanics&#8221; in the evangelical churches, just as the traitorous Catholic Church does. </p>
<p>No, Mr. Land &#8220;hispanics&#8221; are NOT hard wired to be social conservatives! Just the opposite!</p>

		<p>As a former born again Christian, I know what the Christian response would be to the illegal alien issue.</p>
<p>John 18:36 (New International Version) reads:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jesus said, &#8216;My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place.&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>This scripture is alluding to separation of church and state. Specifically, Jesus was saying that his teachings were separate from secular political activity.</p>
<p>Further, the &#8220;render unto Caesar&hellip;&#8221; lesson in the Gospels suggests that Christians should follow the laws of the land.</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/gc2sd" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/gc2sd</a></p>
<p>The Evangelical Christians advocating amnesty for illegal aliens are not following scripture properly.</p>

<p>There is no trying to use reason with these people. They are simply on the enemy&rsquo;s side and they are tax exempt, super rich, don&rsquo;t work at real jobs that are threatened or destroyed by the NW immigration invasion.</p>

		<p>It is no secret that the Hispanic population has saved the once stagnant Catholic church from oblivion. Hispanics are more likely to attend weekly masses than non Hispanics. This has forced Catholic churches to provide Spanish speaking priests to conduct masses for the Hispanic population. What has happened in some parishes, it has developed two entirely separate congregations, one predominately white and English speaking and the other predominately hispanic and spanish speaking,who share the same building but nothing else.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Normally on the opposite side of political issues backed by the Obama White House, these leaders are aligning with the president to support an overhaul that would include some path to legalization for illegal immigrants already here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now we can all see why the words &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; and &ldquo;leadership,&rdquo; are at best overworked phrases, that even &ldquo;our churches&rdquo; now exploit. That includes the Roman Catholic Church, of which I remain a nominal member.  </p>
<p>There never has been and nor can there ever be, a compromise (be it secular or religious in nature) with multiculturalism and the &ldquo;religious leadership&rdquo; in this country, or abroad!</p>
<p>Multiculturalism is Marxism, and is thus evil: it is an evil that rejects God and morality; it is an evil that embraces Islam as &ldquo;equal&rdquo; to Christianity, while it attempts to destroy Christian civilization; it is an evil that advocates genocide of the white race; and it is an evil that masks as being perfect, while encouraging every abnormal and insane practice to the point of making all of mankind into defective automatons at best, mindlessly wandering through the Babel Shopping Malls and up Utopia Towers. Is that what the Bible teaches? Is that why Jesus died on the cross?</p>
<p>I think not!</p>
<p>As always, God Help Us All!!!</p>

		<p>Are there any Christian congregations or study groups that are moving toward a Euro-Christian religion? This would be a form of Christianity that is designed to suit the ethnic and religious needs of European derived people. I&rsquo;m thinking of a religion that plays down the divisions between Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox, but emphasizes the common Christian heritage of Europe, the West, and Christendom. </p>

		<p>Notice that it says that evangelical &#8216;leaders&rsquo; are the ones who are pushing for amnesty. The leaders of the mainline churches have already scared off many of their parishoners with their extreme leftist positions on a wide range of issues.  The only real solution to this problem is for Protestants to only partonize churches that are fully independant congregations, those with any connection to a hierarchy that takes positions on issues that are clearly political like immigration should be avoided. Unfortunately for the Catholics, attending churches that are fully self-sufficeient and not being run by mushy leftists is not a possibilty, since the church&rsquo;s hierarchy is in an integral part of catholicism.</p>

		<p>Lets be honest folks, these so called religious leaders are in it for the money. I may be struck down for saying it, but it is the truth. As Americans drift from the church, those south of the border are not as adrift and will bring money to the church in the future. Just another industry selling out the United States for a buck. Capitalism at its worst.</p>

		<p>anonymous 7 and ellen [9] have no idea about true Christianity and quote part of Scripture so out of context as to be laughable were it not so sad. read your Bible people - it is constantly advising separation of the races. oh, and baptist, catholics etc are not Christian. if they were, they would follow Jesus and His teachings as opposed to the &#8220;traditions of men&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Sounds like Richard Land has been listening to the Karl Rove/George W./John McCain version of immigration policy.  It sounds like all of the nonsense talk that these rinos have been spouting for years.  There is also some Hispanic evangelical leader who has been promoting amnesty for several years.  Land has come under the sway of these people.  No doubt they reached out to him.  These open border people are like so many spiders in the way they weave their web of deceit.  The open borders machine never stops and will try anything to promote their open borders propaganda.  Listen carefully to their propaganda and you can see how they are working behind the scenes.  They are always reaching out to anyone they can use.  These people could teach Machiavelli a few tricks.</p>

Evangelicals represent the most ignorant, backward elements of the population. So naturally, they appeal especially to blacks. And just as naturally, they can be counted on to be wrong on just about any major issue. They are classic examples of those who are so dumb that they don&rsquo;t even know they&rsquo;re dumb.</p>

		<p>This is another example of &#8220;invade the world;invite the world&#8221; in action. Evangelical Preachers are well known enthusiasts for invading and occupying the rest of the world. From this fact, you could easily pedict-with 100 percent certainty- that they would enthusiastically support an immigration policy that will over time-not too much time anymore-reduce the Native Born White American Majority to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America.</p>

		<p>Jesus said to give to Caesar what is Caesar&rsquo;s.  His philosophy favored obeying the laws of the land while peacefully disseminating his message.  It&rsquo;s understandable that Christian leadership feels compelled to offer solace to poor people, and it&rsquo;s no surprise that preachers and priests want to fill the pews, but there&rsquo;s no reason why they can&rsquo;t use the concept of law-abiding to oppose illegal immigration.  <br>
Of course, even if a &#8220;path to legalization&#8221; is passed, most illegals won&rsquo;t take advantage.  They won&rsquo;t learn proficient English, pay fees and fines, or even submit themselves to the authorities for any sort of evaluation.  They&rsquo;re quite satisfied to scurry like rats in the shadows, taking under-the-table pay for services and dope.  They don&rsquo;t want to be responsible Americans.</p>

<p>Makes this so-called Christianity part and parcel of our demise. Traitors to the core. I will wager NONE of these people who are pro-nonwhite immigration are real Christians. Christianity used to be called a White man&rsquo;s religion for a reason, only Whites have forgotten this truism. They have been trying to convert nonwhites for centuries AND bringing them into our own lands and this is the result. Christianity will die on the vine thanks to all these &#8220;missionaries&#8221;. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget their absolute insanity of pushing White Christians into adopting any nonwhite child,(mainly from African countries and China) thereby compounding our problem tenfold. </p>

<p>When an ethnic group&rsquo;s definition of &#8220;thinking big&#8221; means operating your own taco truck; and &#8220;reaching for the sky&#8221; means opening a mom-n-pop bodega to sell tins of refried beans and Spanish-language newspapers, that is a group that will NEVER supply America with the sort of visionary capitalists (and mass employers) that built the country in the 19th and 20th centuries. </p>
<p>If these mixed-race underachievers had ANY vision or ambition, shouldn&rsquo;t the economies of Latin America be something more than just the stack of banana republics and basket cases stretching from Tijuana all the way down to Tierra del Fuego that they are? </p>
<p>It is the mestizo&rsquo;s lack of financial savvy that drives these brown dullards northward to Gringoland in search of stoop labor and/or handouts. If they were really entrepreneurial, they could become prosperous without leaving their home countries. Instead, they must leech off the entrepreneurship   &mdash;   and the misguided altruism   &mdash;   of their enemies, the &#8220;Anglos.&#8221; </p>

		<p>   This article is one of just a few that demonstrates what is wrong with christianity. It is used to control white people. I turned my back on ALL organized religions for that very reason. I still believe in God, but not in the churches. If anything the pagans represent my cause and concerns more so than christianity. </p>

		<p>Not very Christian of them to support Communist thugs and cartel gangsters from south of the border.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t surprise me anymore, many false Christians go into the ministry to make money.</p>

		<p>Amnesty would put tens of millions of Hispanics on the welfare rolls since businesses would fire their newly amnestied employees and replace them with fresh illegals.  </p>
<p>The communist wretches in congress and the oval office know this and intend to use these tens of millions of parasitic unemployed amnestied illegals to help destroy our economy&hellip;    </p>

		<p>&#8220;anonymous 7 and ellen [9] have no idea about true Christianity and quote part of Scripture so out of context as to be laughable were it not so sad. read your Bible people - it is constantly advising separation of the races. oh, and baptist, catholics etc are not Christian. if they were, they would follow Jesus and His teachings as opposed to the &#8216;traditions of men&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The very nature of your post is fallacious. Haven&rsquo;t you ever heard of a no true Scotsman fallacy? Apparently not, otherwise you wouldn&rsquo;t have used it by saying that certain Christian denominations were not &#8220;true&#8221; Christians.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t take any scripture out of context. You failed to explain even <i>how</i> it was taken out of context. I actually provided an explanation that made sense, but you didn&rsquo;t provide an explanation at all.</p>
<p>The website you provided perverts the message of the Gospels and twists them into an agenda; it also contains anti-Semitic writings (now who was taking the Bible out of context?). If Jesus were alive today, I doubt he would be pleased with people turning his religion into a mechanism for an agenda (that goes for both left-wingers and right-wingers).</p>
<p>If all race realists are like you (and unfortunately a number are), the battle against egalitarianism is lost. Neo-Nazis, skin heads, Klansmen and other extremists make race realism look ugly.</p>

		<p>The churches are actually PAID by the federal govt to resettle &#8220;refugees&#8221;. The Catholics and Lutherans have long been in this biz. Looks like the Baptists now want some of the action. Besides, we&rsquo;re all God&rsquo;s children and therefore really all the same. Cha-ching!</p>

		<p>The rise of Christianity unified European whites and provided a rallying point after the fall of the Roman Empire, but it has outlived its usefulness now that it has gone global.</p>
<p>Let the Hispanics, the Africans, and a few oddball Asians and Arabs have Christianity. It was never a European faith. It belonged to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The natural faith of the white race is found in Nordic and Greek polytheism, which rejects the concept of one brotherhood of man.</p>
<p>Whites will only be free when they liberate themselves from Christianity.   </p>

		<p>Note the Mormons also support the same open borders policy, but for slightly different reasons - they are seeking to recruit more actively in Mexico and South American generally. thus, avarice again beats down justice.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Are there any Christian congregations or study groups that are moving toward a Euro-Christian religion? This would be a form of Christianity that is designed to suit the ethnic and religious needs of European derived people. I&rsquo;m thinking of a religion that plays down the divisions between Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox, but emphasizes the common Christian heritage of Europe, the West, and Christendom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other than Christain Identity, there are none that I&rsquo;m aware of.  A lot of white nationalists are Christians, but there don&rsquo;t seem to enough of them in one place to actually form any pro-white churches(again, other than CI).   A lot of WNs gravitate towards more conservative sects, but none of these sects are actually pro-white.</p>
<p>The Evangelical/Fundamentalist movement had racially aware elements through the 1970&rsquo;s, but they all seem to have &#8220;seen the light&#8221; about the necessity of white racial suicide.  The church has been a major force in keeping racially aware white Southerners from organizing politically to advance white interests.  As we see in this article, the Evangelical churches use their influence to keep the Republican party and conservative movement firmly in the anti-white camp.  </p>

		<p>Christian churches have become the enemy of White people.  All of these churches send your hard earned monies to minorities who in turn use it against you.  A simple case of biting the hand that feeds you.  All this money is also increasing the non-white birth rate to staggering proportions by promoting and encouraging illegitimate non-white birth rates and raising the standard of living for non-whites everywhere as our own living standards continue to decline. I was shocked when I found out that 40 percent of the birth rate globally is illegitimate and most of it is in Africa. Whites have become slave labor for these corporate churches, providing everything from funds to local and international efforts like building houses for minorities, rescue efforts, etc. all under the guise of giving generously to help others when in fact it&rsquo;s enriching the pockets of those do not have your interests at heart whatsoever.  It&rsquo;s a system that&rsquo;s been hijacked by closet liberal clergy who seek to advance biased socialism while ruining White people. Hang onto you hard-earned monies because you will need it.</p>
