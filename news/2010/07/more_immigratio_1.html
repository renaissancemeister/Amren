<h1><a href="https://www.eutimes.net/2010/07/more-immigration-for-europe-says-brussels/">More Immigration for Europe Says Brussels</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>European Union Times, July 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>BUREAUCRATS are planning to encourage more new migrants to come to the EU despite rising levels of unemployment, it emerged last night.</p>
<p>Brussels officials are to simplify entry rules for workers heading to Europe to take up temporary seasonal jobs in farming, tourism and other industries.</p>
<p>EU home affairs commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said: &#8220;We need immigrant workers in order to secure our economic survival.&#8221;</p>
<p>She claimed more were needed to fill &#8220;labour shortages&#8221;.</p>
<p>But her remarks are bound to provoke new concerns that Eurocrats are determined to press for ever higher levels of immigration.</p>
<p>Last night, Home Office insiders insisted Britain would refuse to sign up to the latest overhaul of EU border controls.</p>
<p>Mrs Malmstrom said: &#8220;We know unemployment rates are still very high in Europe. Paradoxically, at the same time there are labour shortages.&#8221; She plans to speed up procedures for hiring managers, specialists and seasonal workers from outside the 27 EU member states.</p>
<p>The EU lacks workers in certain sectors even though average unemployment is at 10 per cent, up from seven per cent before the crisis, commission officials said. Mrs Malmstrom  &mdash;  responsible for migration policies  &mdash;  has said the EU will continue to need extra workers in the next few years even though slower economic growth is putting pressure on some EU governments to curb the number of immigrants.</p>
<p>An ageing population and low birth rates mean that migrant labour will be necessary to help EU growth in the long term.</p>
<p>Mrs Malmstrom said: &#8220;In light of the demographic challenge the EU is facing, where our active population is forecasted to start falling already in 2013, we need immigrant workers in order to secure our economic survival.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will continue to take more steps towards a more inclusive labour migration policy for the EU in the coming years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the proposals, which have to be approved by EU governments and the European Parliament, companies will be able to bring seasonal workers into the EU more quickly to address changing needs.</p>
<p>Officials insist the measures are aimed at tackling the growing problem of illegal migrants working in a black economy. Thousands, many from Africa, are hired each year to do jobs such as harvesting tomatoes in Italy.</p>
<p>But critics of mass immigration insist that unemployed native workers should be encouraged  &mdash;  or forced through benefit cuts  &mdash;  to take up the work. The new rules would force employers to prove they provide accommodation and set up a complaints mechanism.</p>
<p>And companies would benefit from simplified application procedures when bringing managers and specialists into EU branches of international corporations.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Mrs Malmstrom said last night: &#8220;It is up to each member state to decide whether they need more seasonal workers and how many they should take. If they don&rsquo;t need more seasonal workers, of course that is their choice.&#8221;<br>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;we need immigrant workers in order to secure our economic survival.&#8221; - What she really means is that they need immigrant workers in order to secure greater wealth -today- for those already rich.  The cost, to be borne by everyone else, will be higher crime rates, higher health care costs, lower educational standards, and the eventual destruction of the cultures of all the European nation states. </p>

<p>But for how much longer?  The European (Soviet) Union&rsquo;s fangs are bared little by little, and at the same time we can count on the usual unrepresentative elites of each country deciding that their people &#8220;need&#8221; more &#8220;seasonal workers&#8221; who never go home.<br>

		<p>This is what you get when the culture has degenerated to the point where materialism is the highest value that those in charge aspire to. It was a charge leveled at the communists during the cold war. But who is pushing it now? Western bureaucrats, capitalists, people gone soft and decadent with nothing left to believe in anymore beyond feeding their faces. No future to bequeath to anyone, just turn a buck now.</p>

		<p>The Eurocrats complain of labour shortages during times of high unemployment, and can&rsquo;t explain it.  </p>
<p>What the Eurocrats don&rsquo;t understand is that the more Third World migrants are brought in, the more white workers will refuse to work shoulder to shoulder with them for the same wage. It&rsquo;s a matter of dignity and rightful ownership of European jobs.</p>
<p>Eurocrats live in a virtual world where race doesn&rsquo;t matter. In their world, any worker can be replaced by a worker of a different colour. In the real world, race is a factor in a successful economy.  <br>
 <br>
Every unemployed white who refuses to work in a &#8216;Third-World-ized&rsquo; workplace is committing an act of resistance; Eurocrats don&rsquo;t get it. The increasingly desperate EU will turn to more immigrants and the use of force to counter white labour rebellion.</p>
<p>Eventually, the whole thing will blow up in their faces.</p>

<p>Europe and North America are both rich in resources. The EU parliament is a puppet of unelected global financial elites who want those resources exploited to the maximum degree.</p>
<p>Immigrants are consumers. Consumers equal profits.  </p>
<p>If you want to know who is dictating policy, look to who benefits.</p>

Modern economies are nothing more than government sanctioned ponzi schemes; bring in more at the bottom to pay for those at the top.</p>
<p>Like all ponzi schemes, they&rsquo;re doomed to collapse. The welfare/entitlement state can not continue, let alone thrive. Continued economic &#8216;growth&rsquo; is little more than ink on paper. </p>
<p>It will collapse. The only questions are is when and how bad it will be.</p>

		<p>That Europe needs massive immigration from the third-world to ensure its short-term &#8220;economic survival&#8221; is debatable.  What is not in question is the long-term consequences of such suicidal policies.</p>

		<p>Money and votes trump everything for white businessmen and white politicians.  Greed has always been a problem for white people who control the destiny of all white people.  This mindset of using non-white people for cheap labor got it&rsquo;s start in the modern era in earnest with the Atlantic slave trade.  The white settlers nearly wiped out the Amerindians only to bring Africans over to do work and in doing so they brought en masse the first non-white group into white society.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter how geographically close a non-white person is to white people or how many years they have interacted with white people they will never be white physically, socially and genetically.  White people have to suffer the consequences like having black criminals roam the streets because of jury nulifaction or East Asians hogging AP classes in high school to raise their GPA score to better their chance at getting into college or having 12 Latinos living next door in a three bedroom house playing loud music all the time.  Money and votes are not everything.  Europe will survive and thrive without non-white people.</p>

<p>It seems that whether there&rsquo;s a boom, you need more immigrant workers, and when there&rsquo;s a bust, you need more immigrant workers. When times are good, you need more immigrant workers; and when times are bad, you need more immigrant workers.    </p>
<p>Hey, I think I catch on. The formula seems fairly simple. Bad times call for more immigrant workers, and good times call for more immigrant workers. The solution to all economic problems is more immigrant workers.   In other words, in any case,  no matter what,  you ALWAYS need more &#8220;immigrant workers&#8221;.   And no matter how many you already have, regardless,  there&rsquo;s no such thing as enough.  (And btw, I&rsquo;m sure those &#8220;immigrant workers&#8221; once in place, never go home again. How perfect! What a splendid way to achieve diversity.)</p>
<p>Hmmm.   Malmstrom.  A Swedish name, I note.   What a pity.  She&rsquo;s not satisfied with destroying her own country and people, she wants to destroy all of Europe, in the name of Holy  Die-versity.   </p>
<p>Yes, rabid Marxism is indeed a mental illness.</p>

It was Enoch Powell and other right-wing British Tories who educated me to this fact, and others must wake-up and realise just what a monster the EU is.<br>
 The EU is suffereing economically mainly because of the ill-conceived and unworkeable Euro currency foisted on to it by undemocratic elites.</p>

<p>Mr. Non-Apologetic White Man?   This entire effort to flood every white majority nation with millions of non-whites from every Third World backwater nation on Earth - has absolutely zero to do with &#8216;economics&rsquo; or &#8216;labor shortages&rsquo;.  Those were only &#8216;excuses&rsquo; that these evil and hostile ruling elites have previously used to disguise or camouflage their real agenda, which has been the genocide of all European people and the systematic destruction of every White civilization.   Believe me, that has been the #1 driving objective behind everything that happened that has been harmful and destructive to white majority nations, since at least the end of World War 2.   </p>
<p>The prime difference today, however, is that with unemployment skyrocketing and nation after nation being gutted and devoured by the greedy international bankster gangsters - it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly transparent to millions of whites here, and in Europe and around the world - that there is some other, far more sinister and less easily hidden agenda afoot.  Whites are in the cross-hairs of these hostile, alien, ruling elites who&rsquo;ve seized control of White Western nations - and they fully intend to destroy us, if we do not put aside our inter-tribal petty disagreements, organize ourselves as whites, and then fight and defeat these evil elites.  </p>

		<p>Any economic gains from non-White migration (IF there ARE any, which I totally doubt) are far, far, far more then offset by the accompanying social and cultural disintegration that it inevitably causes. To assume that Europe which survived the black death, the thirty years war and WW1 &amp; 2 is going to be &#8220;saved&#8221; by an invasion of Africans and Asians is as crazy as the ancient Romans thinking the Huns and other barbarians would &#8220;save&#8221; them.</p>

		<p>After the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; are in Belgium, there will be organizations which will tell them that now they are in the EU, they can go anywhere they want within the EU. They then will be advised of which countries within the EU have the best welfare and other freebies, those that are slack on enforcing laws against the muslims (and most of the &#8216;immigrants&#8221; will in fact be black, African muslims) where they can rape at will. France and England will bear the brunt of it, and Netherlands of course. Also, if the Obamaster has his way, their entry into the EU will allow them free will to get over here at our taxpayer expense..</p>
