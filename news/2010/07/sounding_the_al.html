<p>Few critics of mass immigration write as knowledgeably or forcefully as syndicated columnist and frequent AR contributor Samuel Francis. <cite>America Extinguished</cite> is a collection of columns written between 1998 and 2000, and a quick review of the titles  &mdash;  &#8220;GOP Can Win Without Pandering to Minorities&#8221; and &#8220;Language Anarchy May Fracture National Bonds,&#8221; etc.  &mdash;  shows many are as timely as if they had been written yesterday.</p>
<p>What sets Dr. Francis apart from so many other critics of mass immigration  &mdash;  aside from his acerbic wit  &mdash;  is that he writes with a realistic understanding of race. Mass immigration is a crisis not so much because of the numbers (33.1 million from 1970 to 2002), but because the overwhelming majority of immigrants are non-white. Many do not speak English and most are ignorant of, if not hostile to, American history and culture. Left unchecked, mass non-white immigration will forever alter the character of the United States.</p>
<p>Race matters, Dr. Francis notes, because &#8220;race <em>carries</em> and <em>parallels</em> culture. The different colors that are going to shade the flesh of future Americans come from different countries and different cultures, where different tastes, patterns of behavior, ways of thinking, and varying norms prevailed.&#8221; The mainstream immigration debates of the 1980s and 1990s ignored the consequences of the impending racial transformation. Race came up only when a supporter of mass immigration was losing an argument, and accused his opponent of &#8220;racism,&#8221; or &#8220;xenophobia.&#8221; Assimilation was to be thought of in strictly economic terms  &mdash;  unemployment rates, household income  &mdash;  and never in &#8220;the less tangible and quantifiable truths about the acceptance of distinctively American values, norms, and institutions.&#8221;</p>

</table><p>Dr. Francis points out that these &#8220;less tangible and quantifiable truths&#8221; mean nothing to supporters of mass immigration, either on the left or the right. Leftists are openly hostile to traditional America, and welcome the displacement of whites as a cure for racism. Those on the right who support mass immigration are almost exclusively neo-conservatives or libertarians, and are generally indifferent to traditional America as a &#8220;distinct, historically articulated&#8221; society and culture. To them, America is an idea, an abstraction  &mdash;  a &#8220;credal nation,&#8221; a &#8220;proposition nation,&#8221; the &#8220;first universal nation&#8221;  &mdash;  open to anyone. Dr. Francis quotes from a 1994 statement written for William Bennett and Jack Kemp: &#8220;[T]he American national identity is not based on ethnicity, or race, or national origin, or religion. The American nation identity is based on a creed, on a set of principles and ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Francis points out that this view ignores the central facts of the founding of our country. &#8220;Throughout American history,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;the vast majority of immigrants have been of European stock and culture. They brought European languages that were not too different from each other. They brought religious beliefs that were historically connected. They brought social institutions, manners, and customs rooted in the same traditions, ethics and world views. And they were all of essentially the same racial stock. Since they were largely homogeneous to begin with, it&rsquo;s not all that surprising they formed one nation that has retained homogeneity until recently.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Francis notes that today&rsquo;s immigrants do not want to assimilate and no one seems to expect them to. Our rulers have even begun to act as if Spanish had the same status as English. &#8220;[B]usinesses and politicians will do nothing to stop the transformation of our language,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;They refuse to do so precisely because Hispanics are a bloc and because the bloc doesn&rsquo;t want to learn or use English, and the politicians and businessmen are more scared of the Hispanic bloc than they are of the American, English-speaking bloc. That&rsquo;s because there is no such bloc.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>The Stupid Party</b></p>
<p>A solid majority of Americans wants to halt mass immigration, but special interests thwart its wishes. Big business wants cheap labor. Unions want bodies to prop up declining membership. Churches want to fill empty pews. Democrats see non-whites as future supporters. And much to Dr. Francis&rsquo;s disgust, the Republican Party is also part of the immigration lobby. Mass immigration will doom the party at the national level well before the white majority is displaced, and Republicans&rsquo; persistent inability to comprehend this self-evident truth is one reason Dr. Francis refers to the GOP as the Stupid Party (the Democrats are the Evil Party).</p>
<p>The Stupid Party drew precisely the wrong conclusion from the 1994 fight over California&rsquo;s Proposition 187 to withhold state benefits from illegal immigrants. Although Democrats, liberals, and the national media denounced 187 as racist and bigoted, it passed with 60 percent of the vote. Embattled Republican California Gov. Pete Wilson seemed headed for defeat until he embraced 187, and several Republican congressmen who endorsed it were also reelected. That same year, the Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years. But rather than rally to immigration control as the winning issue it obviously was, the Republicans were too afraid of being called bad names in the <cite>Washington Post</cite> and <cite>New York Times.</cite> It was after the <em>victory</em> of Proposition 187 that Republicans began to woo the Hispanic vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;The brute fact,&#8221; Dr. Francis notes in a 2000 essay, &#8220;is that Mr. Bush would not be in the lead at all [or subsequently elected] if it were not for the same white male voters who have kept the Republicans in power for decades. The Republicans  &mdash;  the smart ones anyway  &mdash;  know this, and they know treading on the toe of the white male voter .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is political suicide.&#8221;</p>
<p>What most Republican strategists ignore, Dr. Francis writes, &#8220;is that Hispanic voters in the United States tend to be liberal regardless of what they think about immigration, and that is the real reason they don&rsquo;t vote Republican very much.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It&rsquo;s not so much the conservative opposition to immigration that alienates Hispanics from the Republican Party; it&rsquo;s conservatism in general.&#8221;</p>
<p>Republicans believe white men have no place else to go. This may be true for the time being, but as Dr. Francis&rsquo;s discussion of Patrick Buchanan&rsquo;s presidential campaigns suggests, the GOP&rsquo;s steady sacrifice of traditional Republican policies, and its misguided appeal to Hispanics and other non-whites could bring new political movements to life.</p>
<p>Dr. Francis&rsquo;s final diagnosis: &#8220;The Republicans can follow one of two strategies. They can keep pandering to the Hispanic bloc and wind up turning their party into a carbon copy of the Democrats .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or they can remain what they are, purge themselves of panderers, and rally real Americans to a real conservative banner that swears friendship to no nation, and speaks no language but our own.&#8221;</p>

</table><p>Dr. Francis points out that Mexico plays a deliberate and corrosive part in America&rsquo;s ongoing crisis. &#8220;Mexico&rsquo;s immigration policy is and for the last 30 years or so has been to dump as many of its people on the United States as it can,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;By doing so, Mexico exports excess people, ne&rsquo;er-do-wells and criminals, helps relieve internal political and economic pressures and, in recent years, has actually developed a fifth column of its own nationals inside the United States that it manipulates for its own political purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is going on here,&#8221; Dr. Francis concludes, &#8220;is a vocal and transparent effort by the Mexican government simply to reoccupy a large part of the United States that it claims was stolen from it and to use its own illegal immigrant fifth column here to manipulate the internal politics of what it doesn&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t yet take back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Francis details how changes in Mexican laws encourage Mexicans in the US to vote in Mexican elections, and make it easier for their political parties to organize Mexicans living here to pressure the US government to adopt policies favorable to Mexico. Should a real attempt be made to halt Mexican immigration, it will no doubt be greeted with mass demonstrations orchestrated by Mexico City. Dr. Francis rightfully characterizes these policies as &#8220;very close to being an act of war.&#8221;</p>
<p>For years, Dr. Francis has been trying to alert Middle America to the threats to our race, culture and civilization. America is not yet extinguished, but Dr. Francis tells us the writing is on the wall: &#8220;As the population figures .&nbsp;.&bnsp;. suggest, the time when Americans can mount any resistance to immigration is short. The day is soon coming  &mdash;  Mexican revanchists remind us of it all the time  &mdash;  when the immigrants will simply be too many for any sitting politician to call for immigration controls without inviting political suicide. Americans who read these columns and agree with their drift cannot afford to wait for sitting politicians to stop sitting and take action. If we ourselves are not willing to do what is necessary, we have no right to expect anyone else to do it for us.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I agree with Sam Francis&rsquo;s wake-up call and diagnosis and AmRens take on it. I have a slight disagreement with what the late Sam Francis has claimed earlier, that we need to look to the past and to tradition. Another poster pointed out that Francis disagreed with the idea that whites should form their own racial special interest groups preferring instead for whites to try and make changes - or revert backwards - from inside the establishment. I think it&rsquo;s time for something new. Even Afrikaner&rsquo;s, who still believe in the rainbow coalition - even they know it&rsquo;s time for change. </p>

		<p>I want to speak up for Samuel Huntington&rsquo;s book &#8216;Who We Are&rsquo;, about the demographic makeup of the US, and how homogeneity is a good thing. Actually I got through only half of it before I had to move but, he&rsquo;s of the same sentiment as this book; possibly more genteel about it, he &#8216;passed&rsquo; in mainstream (you can find interviews with him on youtube, too). One fact that stood out to me, was that even up to 1990, about half of the US population wasn&rsquo;t of immigrant, but /pioneer/ stock! They had big families back then. Also, he points out that F. D. Roosevelt was the first to use the phrase &#8216;nation of immigrants&rsquo;, point being that it&rsquo;s relatively recent, and was wrong when he said it. </p>

		<p>It took several years, but we&rsquo;re witnessing Francis&rsquo;s predictions in the mindset and activism of the Tea Party movement.  The leftist TV pundits pooh-pooh the struggle, but, in the same breath, bemoan that it&rsquo;s the bane of America and &#8220;determined to take power&#8221; (Chris Matthews).  <br>
It&rsquo;s amazing to me how many people apparently believe that the illegals will smilingly march down to their local government office, happily hand over fines and fees, and sign up for the next English-as-a-second-language class.  Even the cartel folks will be so grateful, it seems, that they will give up drug crime and open small, mama-and-papa (fill in the blank) ethnic restaurants.  <br>
Anglo-Americans simply have to make elected reps fear them more than they fear Hispanics.  One overwhelming vote against the reconquista agenda should do wonders.  Vote in November.</p>

		<p>The ultimate political power will always lie with those who &#8216;endorse&rsquo; (pay for) a given candidates policy platform by building it with planks made of special interests.</p>
<p>That one single fact will ALWAYS sabotage any political accountability of any would be legislator or POTUS until and unless American&rsquo;s either force through legislation denying the legality of these groups and their influence on elections (effectively nationalizing everyone&rsquo;s campaign around a limited budget and fixed agenda which they must be judged on in their incumbency).  While at the same time increasing the salaries of these officials so that we can attract truly smart, incorruptible, types to office.</p>
<p>Less an &#8216;or&rsquo; alternative than supplement to this being the use of a public vote of non-confidence in said representative so that those so completely disgusted with the available candidates can (in a multiparty system) perhaps act as negative modifiers to disqualify certain runners without necessarily voting for others.</p>
<p>America doesn&rsquo;t represent Americans anymore.  Until that changes, politics mean nothing.</p>

		<p> <i>Republicans&rsquo; persistent inability to comprehend this self-evident truth </i></p>
<p>The Republican aren&rsquo;t stupid,  they fully understand that this is the demise of America and Western civilization.  Everybody understands that.  They&rsquo;re crooks, not stupid, they&rsquo;re the sort of fake opposition you get in a democracy-in-name-only where there is no free and fair debate.  They&rsquo;re a beard whose payment for selling out their people and nation is the opportunity to service big business.   They figure the regime is going to destroy the nation anyway, they might as well make a buck while they can.  There was a time when they might have made a difference, but in their distaste for average people, for the economic classes below then,  they just couldn&rsquo;t work up any enthusiasm for helping people they can&rsquo;t help but sneer at.   Francis did no one any favor by reviving the title of &#8220;Stupid Party&#8221;,  it just helps the Republicans to continue the con by providing a face-saving lie for their supporters.  It reminds me of those prisoners thrown into the Gulag who cried &#8220;If only Stalin knew!&#8221;</p>

		<p>It is important to recognize the complicity of the right in opposing restrictions on immigration.<br>
 <br>
A high rate of immigration means more consumers and more job applicants.  By the law of supply and demand this means higher prices, lower wages, and consequently higher profits.  <br>

		<p>The Democrats err in waiting for a non white majority.  If such a majority comes about we do not know how it will vote.  We can be confident that most whites will vote against it.<br>

<p>In the short run, the wealthy can save money by employing immigrant workers, since immigrants from the Third World will accept lower wages and less desirable working conditions than native-born Americans would demand.  But do the elites ever ask themselves, what will the endgame look like? In other words, what will happen after nonwhites become a majority of the population and vote their own people into political power?  Will wealthy whites be allowed to lock themselves up in their gated communities and enjoy their wealth?</p>
<p>The experience of Zimbabwe and South Africa suggest, maybe not. <br>

		<p><i>By defining the elites primarily as money-makers, moreover, Lasch avoids the real problem our elites pose: their cultural and political values. &#8220;Efforts to define a &#8216;new class&rsquo; composed of public administrators and policy makers, relentlessly pushing a program of liberal reforms, ignore the range of political <br>
opinions among the professional and managerial elites.&#8221; But this misses the point. The &#8220;new class&#8221; does not include, as Lasch contends it does, &#8220;brokers, bankers, realestate promoters and developers, engineers, consultants of all kinds, systems analysts, scientists, doctors,&#8221; but rather is made up of those in the second half of his list: &#8220;publicists, publishers, editors, advertising executives, art directors, moviemakers, entertainers, journalists, television producers and directors, artists, writers, university professors.&#8221; Only by lumping the two groups together can he claim that there is no common political outlook. What is distinctive about the latter group is that they influence cultural and political attitudes, as the former group does not. One Oliver Stone motion picture has far more impact on the way Americans see their country than all the pronouncements of the chairmen of the boards of General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Microsoft, and IBM combined. The group to which Mr. Stone belongs is overwhelmingly of leftist disposition. That is the &#8220;new class&#8221; &hellip; When Lasch stops riding the theme of the evils of meritocracy and wealth and the threat they pose to democracy, his book becomes much more interesting. He <br>
eventually forgets about bankers and brokers, and begins implicitly to define elites as comprising his second category, those engaged in ideas and entertainment. He recognizes that it is these elites, not real-estate developers, who are in revolt against America.</i> - Robert Bork reviewing &#8220;The Revolt of the Elites&#8221; by Christopher Lasch.</p>
<p>Cheap labor is more of a cheap excuse for Republican and Conservative supporters of open borders than a motivating factor.  They support open borders mainly to avoid being called racist by the media-centered oligarchy, it&rsquo;s part of their overall embracing of, or at least refusal to oppose, political correctness that has more to do with buying peace for them than getting cheap labor for business.   Mass immigration is a racial program driven by hatred and supported by the powerful -  economics is a non-issue.   All the evidence suggests that in the long run, and most would say even in the short run, it is more likely to produce economic decline rather than growth.  Even Republicans don&rsquo;t believe that, say,  a France with a majority African and Muslim population is going to be an economic powerhouse, or anything but a basket case.   </p>

One does not get places in politics by changing people&rsquo;s minds.  One gets places by articulating and channeling attitudes that already exist.  Oliver Stone only reinforces the opinions of those who already agree with him.  Rush Limbaugh has more of an effect on American politics than Stone, and others of Stone&rsquo;s persuasion.  </p>

I doubt most of America&rsquo;s rich share your concerns and mine for the future of the United States, Bud.  It is well known that they value short term profits more than the long term health of the corporations that provide them with their lavish life styles.  They certainly value short term profits more than the wellbeing of their employees.<br>
 <br>
They also know that in heterogeneous third world countries the rich live very well while paying lower taxes.  <br>
