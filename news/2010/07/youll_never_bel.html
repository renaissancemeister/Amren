		<p>There ARE a lot of us who saw BO for what he is - a halfbreed Affirmative Action product who got free education but no learning, and who had not one iota of experience when it came to actual governing.  He clearly cannot escape the race traps that so many have set for him - he doesn&rsquo;t have the savvy or the experience.  So I can&rsquo;t say this is anything of a surprise.  What IS a surprise - and was - is   &mdash;   why did so many people NOT see what I and others like me saw, to the point that they actually elected this clown?  Race should not be an issue for the President of the United States   &mdash;   but no President should have sat for 20 years in a white-hating reparations-demanding revisionist-history church, either; and he insults our intelligence by saying he didn&rsquo;t know what Wright was teaching.  And the idiots who voted for him let him get by with that lie!!!  So, those who elected him got what they deserved.  I just hope we can get him OUT of there with a minimum of further serious damages&hellip;</p>

		<p>Anyone that believes anything that John &#8216;riding the gravy train of racisim&rsquo; Lewis says needs mental help. I wouldn&rsquo;t trust that old school thug as far as I could throw him. He said that he was spat upon and called the n-word 15 times while walking thru the tea partiers, but yet NO proof has been found even after a $100,000 reward.</p>
<p> We may not have a &ldquo;nation of cowards&rdquo; on race, as Attorney General Eric Holder contended, but we may have a West Wing of cowards on race.</p>
<p>I would pay good money to be able to sit in the West Wing and watch as the black plague desends on the &#8216;diversity is great&rsquo; White boys. Can you imagine - J. Jack$on, Al $harpton, &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Wright, M. Walters, L. Farrakhan, Van Jones etc. &#8216;bussin down da does of oppression&rsquo; of the &#8216;Wesss Wing&rsquo;! It would definately be in the running for grand prize on Americas Funniest Home Video!  <br>

Comment<br>
The author distorts recent history. Rep. John Lewis declares that Shirley Sherrod doesn&rsquo;t have a racist hair on her head. However, Rep. Lewis, Sherrod, and the NAACP all support racist policies - like demanding to know the race of an applicant for university, and granting special privileges to Blacks for admissions, scholarships, jobs, promotions, contracts. Affirmative action is racist. It is in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which, if you note the debates prior to passage, clearly outlawed quotas, and rejected proportional representation of the workforce, and rejected granting racial privileges. Lewis, the NAACP, Sherrod, do not want &#8220;civil rights.&#8221; They demand racial privileges. When whites did better in objective exams for jobs, etc., Eleanor Holmes Norton did everything she could under President Carter to prevent the use of testing in employment, etc. Unable to detect the best qualified applicants, firms had to hire by quota to satisfy the government. And Obama agrees with them. Moreover, the Justice Department dropped the case against the New Black Panther Party because the Eric Holder&rsquo;s Department is now covertly racist, unwilling to protect the voting rights of whites when intimidated by Blacks. Obama is unwilling to enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965 against a Black racist, intimidation organization. Obama may have tried to distance himself from the racism of Rev. Wright, but he sat in the pews of Wright&rsquo;s church for years listening to the anti-white hatred of the pastor.<br>
Obama&rsquo;s White House is the anti-white House Presidency.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -Hugh Murray<br>

		<p>So Obama needs someone who understands &#8220;the slave thing&#8221; huh? What a stupid remark moron. Perhaps he would be better off finding a person that understands slavery ended a LONG time ago, that no such person exsists, and it&rsquo;s time to move on and quit whining about ancient history. Whitey is sick of it already.</p>

		<p>Has there ever been a more self-hating White person than Maureen Dowd (well possibly Chris Matthews)? What is her story? And what&rsquo;s with Geraldine Ferraro and her &#8220;smart a.. White guys&#8221; remark? It&rsquo;s as if these people have renounced their Whiteness. <br>
Do they somehow think that they&rsquo;re going to have positions of responsibility in the coming Robert Mugabe or perhaps Idi Amin style society?<br>
Maureen needs a life. Perhaps she should solicit one of the Karr brothers or Wesley Cook for a jail house marriage.</p>

		<p>Even liberals have a point where their love of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; conflicts with their job security and comfort zone.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that when diversity types succeed in flooding an area with non-whites, that even they (the liberals) move too and follow white flight wherever it goes?</p>
<p>They justify it to themselves saying they&rsquo;re looking for a &#8216;good&rsquo; area with &#8216;good&rsquo; schools.  The only trouble is that they bring their poison with them and work on &#8216;integrating&rsquo; the new areas that whites carved out for themselves, and the wheel turns again.  (Do you know that most young white teachers are now totally into the &#8216;social justice&rsquo; thing and teach about nothing else, regardless of the subject?)</p>
<p>In many large urban areas, the majority of the populace is non-white, and the only real vestiges of white power that are left are in the dwindling business or city government realms.  There may be holdover white teachers and cops also, but their numbers dwindle over time.</p>
<p>Most of those &#8216;white&rsquo; people who still have contact with the city are older and are not being replaced as their grown children have already moved to the suburbs.  In cities that have reached the tipping point and in which the old white guys have pretty much gone, the non-white powers-that-be merely preside over a corrupt free-for-all as the city decays to rust and rubble.</p>
<p>This is the main base of support for the race hustlers.  They &#8216;feed&rsquo; the rage of the non-whites (blacks or hispanics) and blame evil whitey for their crumbling streets, lousy schools and miserable places of living.</p>
<p>What they don&rsquo;t understand - and this never ceases to amaze me - is that they are never, ever smart enough to realize that evil whitey is - GONE.  There is no meaningful white presence at all in their &#8216;liberated&rsquo; cities.  Gone, gone gone.  The white people have left the building!</p>
<p>Now the second thing they never understand is that, why should white people build and maintain the roads, infrastructure, schools, etc of places they do not live in?  Do blacks worry over maintaining schools and bridges and a safe living place in white areas?  They would say it is absurd because they don&rsquo;t live there (yet).  But still, all black areas constantly ask the rest of the state (mostly white people in the suburbs or rural areas) to spend exorbitant amounts on them through tax redistribution.</p>
<p>However, it is up to the people of a given area or location to build or maintain the kind of home and lifestyle they wish.  No one helped white people build their cities, towns and communities.  They built those things with certain goals and attitudes in mind and made a pretty nice world for themselves.</p>
<p>Now black and brown people control vast swaths of America.  It is up to them to build the kind of world they want.  No one will or even should help them.  What for?  Social justice?  No one gave social justice, freebies and special help to the millions of Italian and Irish immigrants of a century ago.  No one helped the Germans of the 1800s or the Eastern Europeans of the 1920s.</p>
<p>All those groups suffered from discriminations netted out by those who were settled before them.  All of them suffered through broken English, lack of medical care/schooling and slums.  But they knew they had to work hard and that the unique promise of America is that it will reward hard work, even if it takes a few generations, to those who are willing to sacrifice.</p>
<p>The problem with many blacks and latinos is that they feel a first class lifestyle should be just handed to them for no reason other than &#8216;social justice&rsquo; or &#8216;equality.&rsquo;  &#8220;You &#8216;have&rsquo; and I don&rsquo;t, so give it to me or I will call you unfair (and racist)!&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of them have no concept that they would by rights have to sacrifice and work hard, improve themselves, stay out of trouble, build for the future with sweat today.  </p>
<p>This is ironic because all those millions of blacks above the Mason-Dixon line migrated north over the last 100 years for what? - for factory work and opportunity, but their grandchildren got soft and lost the work ethic, probably due to being separated from the settled black communities of the south.</p>
<p>Some latinos would argue that they did come here to work hard, and I agree that many do, but there is a class of marxist, brown race hustler that is rising and seeking to emulate the black race hustlers.  </p>
<p>The whole &#8216;amnesty&rsquo; thing is their baby.  &#8220;So what if we broke the law,&#8221; they say, &#8220;America is really a mexican land that you whites took over!&#8221;  </p>
<p>Oh brother!  As if any of these mexican interlopers have roots in this land!  They&rsquo;re all from central and southern mexico and never had any blood connection to this land.  Just go and ask the Apache or the Hopi!</p>
<p>And many blacks would say that they work hard too, but the problem is that many of them are saddled with a crime-prone &#8216;gangsta&rsquo; culture that has disdain for learning and self-control.  Even if the parents are good upstanding citizens, this rap culture will capture the hearts and minds of their children and they will become willful gangbangers and die young or go to jail (after being a baby daddy many times over with many different &#8216;showties&rsquo;).</p>
<p>Both groups of race hustlers are using the federal government as: </p>
<p>1) A cash cow for &#8216;racial discrimination&rsquo;, or in other words, a way to cash in when whitey doesn&rsquo;t want to play with them.</p>
<p>2) A outright theft machine in which the feds use force to take away territory from whites.  In other words, they use the laws to force open white areas to accept them in their midst, even though the whites just want to be left alone in their &#8216;whiteopias,&rsquo; knowing that non-whites do not share the same cultural values and will thus destroy the character of the area in short order.</p>
<p>3) As a tool of revenge, in their twisted minds.  They want to punish whitey for &#8216;centuries&rsquo; of oppression.  </p>
<p>Even though they don&rsquo;t understand that you cannot punish white people for crimes that happened hundreds of years ago, even though they don&rsquo;t realize that most whites in America today are descendants of whites who came here AFTER slavery was over, even though they cannot conceive that no more that 5% of the southern white population ever had slaves, even though they don&rsquo;t understand that 90-95% of ALL kidnapped Africans were brought to the Caribbean, Brazil and Latin America and that they should really be asking for reparations from Spain and Portugal, even though they don&rsquo;t notice that white liberals are falling all over themselves to help non-whites all over the world, even though they don&rsquo;t realize that whites built the modern world that they enjoy so much, even though they don&rsquo;t understand that Asians will never have any sympathy for them, and even though they have no clue that the current American government is a descendant of the Union government that shed blood to FREE the SLAVES, they still have twisted notions of fighting whitey as if we&rsquo;re all K people out to oppress them.  </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t help that the whole white guilt thing sprang up in the last 30-40 years and is aided and abetted by young white teachers who find teaching about &#8216;social justice&rsquo; is easier than actually getting their students to learn math or writing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave it at that for now, but suffice it to say, non-whites do not realize that they are tearing down the very house they want to live in.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity@ You have to give Ms. Dowd some credit for being the first to attack the white guys surrounding Obama instead of white Republicans. At this point blaming Bush no longer seems valid. We have been feed the doctrine of &#8220;black perfection&#8221; and &#8220;white imperfection&#8221; for so long that is fun to now see white liberals bend over backwards in an attempt to justify our half-breed prince.</p>

<p>Enough of White guilt. WE as Whites need to reject this nonsense that Blacks and their White aplogists use as an apologia for Blacks&rsquo; atrocious behavior. If opression were an excuse for criminal behavior, Jews would be  the most  dangerous people on the earth/ <br>

<p>I would suggest you break your post down into several shorter ones, and maybe make the language a little more bland. If the NYT   &mdash;   or any other lamestream media   &mdash;   rejects your one long post, then sneak four shorter ones <i>making essentially the same points</i> in through their back door! </p>
