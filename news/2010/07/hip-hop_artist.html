		<p>Along with these &#8220;new, famous artists&#8221; will be an increase in crime, drugs, rapes, etc., which Branson doesn&rsquo;t need. This concert and others like it should be cancelled&hellip;</p>

		<p>Utterly stupid, even just from a marketing/sales viewpoint.  Destroy the unique attraction of a venue and think people are still going to come?  I guess Lilith Fair should have invited male heavy metal bands to play alongside Natalie Merchant and Sarah McLachlan.  I suppose rap clubs should invite Garth Brooks.  This is stupid just from that standpoint.</p>
<p>When you add in the fact that inviting a rapper to a nice, calm area is change to change that area into a loud, crime-prone area, you&rsquo;re going to increase the fleeing of both your usual patrons and the businesses in the area.</p>

		<p>How anyone could listen to that garbage is beyond me because I detest hip-hop or rap music.  I really think that anyone with a sense of taste and aesthetics would despise this so-called &#8220;music&#8221;.  But one thing is amazing, and that is the power of the media to condition our young (some, not all) to actually follow this trash.  Most of our young, in fact, most people, are nothing but followers or lemmings.  They like something, many of them, simply because the majority of others like it, not because they think it&rsquo;s good.  It can be depressing to see how their minds have been manipulated to adhere to the prevailing attitudes.</p>

		<p>Upon further reflection it has become apparent to me that this is a truly devious way to manipulate the public by the town council. What better way to showcase the validity of deciding to come to Branson and stay for &#8220;the season&#8221; or full time. Like my buddy says about Vegas, &#8220;I`m broke but it beats going back home.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I had planned on taking my family to Branson this summer. I live in Saint Louis. If I wanted this kind of &#8220;entertainment&#8221; I would simply open my windows there is [unfortunately] plenty of it around. Think again Branson,keep it like it was in the good ole&rsquo; days or you will never get my money.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure that will go over well.</p>
<p>Branson&rsquo;s big allure isn&rsquo;t necessarily the country music, it&rsquo;s the country music being a known repellent to a certain kind of person.  Seems to me like they need to turn the volume up a bit.  Then again, Nelly once did a duet with Tim McGraw, so it doesn&rsquo;t seem to keep him away.</p>
<p>Nelly lives in a very upscale, private, hilly, wooded part of St. Louis that is semi-rural.  We found that out when someone of the same complexion burglarized his premises.  He made a boat load of money being &#8220;true dat,&#8221; featuring St. Louis ghettos in some of his videos, yet lives nowhere near them, and as we see, wants to perform nowhere near them.  He even once wore a band-aid on his face to commemorate his incarcerated brother.</p>
<p>Southwest Missouri is getting more and more Hispanic over time.</p>

<p> Why would this idiot bring a black ghetto thug rap &#8220;artist&#8221; to Branson. We just can&rsquo;t let them White folks have ANYTHING to themselves now can we. Mixing a young black ghetto hip - hop groud to a mainly older White country music groud is a receipie for disaster. And when these &#8220;conflicks&#8221; happen, the Whites will be blamed for it, which will then bring more thugs to Branson to support their brothas &#8216;civil rights&rsquo;. This is just a toe in the door folks, within 5 - 10 yrs. Branson will be a no - go town. Hey Paul Dunn, &#8220;manager of the Grand Palace&#8221;, why don&rsquo;t you really go &#8216;out there&rsquo; and introduce &#8220;a wider variety of new, famous country music artists to Detroit! </p>

<p>Shakedown the promoters for money and buses to ship in lots of blacks, hope for an altercation between the &#8220;youth&#8221; and the White Tea Party Country Music Lovers, and then spin the story as more proof that &#8220;ugly virulent racism is pervasive in White dominated culture.  We&rsquo;ve come far, especially with NASCAR, but this toxic Branson incident proves we have much more work to do.&#8221;</p>

		<p>People are not just consuming entities.</p>
<p>They have preferences, feelings, and discriminations.</p>
<p>The promoters seem to think that a White consumer and a Black consumer are equal, because a consumer equals a consumer, and, as long as they are consuming what they prefer, there will be peace and respect.</p>
<p>Alas. Captitalism, of a raceless, ethic-less variety is as great a destroyer as Marxism.</p>

<p>What if they gave a hip-hop concert [is that what it is called, a concert] in Branson - - and NO ONE came?</p>
<p>What percentage of those that make specific visits to Branson are middle-aged or older white folks? 99 % or greater?</p>
<p>I guess there is &#8220;novelty&#8221; to all this. Change is in the air and change is &#8220;good&#8221;.</p>

<p>Can you believe it?</p>
<p>Branson is awfully crowded in season.  Just for that reason alone, I would have to think long and hard about going back there.  Now throw in gang bangers, well, that just makes the decision for me doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>And probably for others as well.  Bye bye, Branson.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t you guys watch COPS?</p>
<p>Economically and cognitively challenged white teens LOVE rap, and frequently dress in saggy-pants mode.  While Darryl and Tawnya might idolize Toby Keith (I just lust after him with the sound turned off&hellip;so big, so blond&hellip;such whiny songs&hellip;), little Brittnayhe and Dusstyn want to hear &#8216;their&rsquo; music (Snoop Dawg..P. Diddy&hellip;).  I nearly fell off the stair master, last year, when I looked over at a neighboring TV, and saw Snoop Dawg come onstage at some Country Music award show.  One would hope that half the audience got up and left, at that point&hellip;</p>
<p>Maybe the industry powers think this is how they lure WT kids into Country.  Possibly, the kids will consent to piling into the Camaro with Mom and Dad for the big trip to Branson, only if one of &#8216;their&rsquo; performers will be there.  Possibly, though, it&rsquo;s the same thing as with NASCAR: the industry powers are thinking ahead to the time when there aren&rsquo;t enough whites to sustain their industry.</p>
<p>Either way, it stinks.</p>

<p>Actually, I would differ with you on that point.  The Marxists knew who to do away with and did it with finality.  Whites today are bourgoise, soaking up whatever is thrown at them from the left or right.  As long as it is packaged right, it slips right in.  There&rsquo;s never been a more brainwashed citizenry than the present, Christian, left/right, &#8220;All American&#8221; consumer.<br>

		<p>I used to listen to country music whenever I was in the car, but for several years now I tune in only to rock oldies.  Country has become so slick and metrosexually urbanized that it seems like a totally different entity than the one I once liked.  <br>
Either the promoters in Branson are just looking for another way to expand their earnings, or a whole new breed is taking over there.  Top dollar, of course, is with the young, so that may explain the whole plan of inviting a rapper.  Hopefully, middle-aged and old folks will avoid such performances like the plague, and it will be a short-lived, failed experiment.</p>

		<p>Hip-hop is not just a different form of &#8220;music,&#8221; it celebrates the worst of urban youth culture, including gangsterism, disrespect for women, whites, cops, and authority in general, the idolizing of the pimpin&rsquo; lifestyle, drugs, crime, degenerate fashion statements, and antisocial behavior. It is a dead-end role model for mainly black kids and should not be promoted anywhere, especially in a decent, white-oriented family destination like Branson.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been to Branson three times in the past 10 years.  Aside from the absolutely horrible traffic, I have always enjoyed myself. The experience is similar to attending a NASCAR event or hockey game, in that it is a refreshingly Caucasian experience.  (Like the America of my youth.)  Paul Dunn is a fool for &#8220;reaching out&#8221; to non-Whites.  They will not be welcome, nor will their crime and shameful behavior.  </p>

		<p>  Isn&rsquo;t audience violence part of the performance at most rap concerts? Obviously, this will take &ldquo;family entertainment&rdquo; to a new level. Perhaps, a drive-by or two and some drug busts will bring added summer excitement to Branson?  I don&rsquo;t believe that Rap aficionados and country music fans will get on well together. </p>

I know how to put an end to this.</p>
<p>Buy up a large block of tickets and go to the nearest black neighborhood and pass out the tickets to all the black guy you see standing around. Make sure it&rsquo;s close enough so they can get there in large numbers.</p>

		<p>Hi # 18 I was just using the open my windows phrase to illustrate the urban noise that is heard quite often here in our once fair city. One does not have to open windows to hear what is often times all invasive. I live and work in the city. Much of it already looks like Detroit. It certainly does not resemble the city in which I grew up.The simple truth of the matter is that Whites have been ethnically cleansed out of the great metropolises that we and our ancestors built. The government,the monied interests along with the media and big education have done this to us. We working class Whites have borne the weight of this tragedy. Had we been displaced by a dynamic group of intelligent hard working individualists it would be no great loss,but have been replaced by low I.Q destructive types who can not compete in a modern European civilization. The sadddest part is that we White working class people are forced to pay through exorbitant taxes for our own demise.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely a patriotic, family oriented venue. </p>
<p>White retirees and young white families.</p>
<p>Adding fans of hip-hop to this mixture is a recipe for failure.</p>

		<p>If this becomes commonplace in Branson, look for the newly enlightened business owners to do their &#8220;closed for remodeling&#8221; THAT particular weekend.  </p>
<p>Theres many businesses where  that happens whenever blacks in large groups congregate. The lost revenue is not worth the theft, damage, violence and noise these idiots bring with them. </p>
<p>That being said, I would prefer the white men of Branson stand on every sidewalk and porch, and give these fools the unwelcome stare I so frequently get when I have to go into a black neighborhood. Let them feel that they are not exactly welcome. Thats long overdue! </p>
