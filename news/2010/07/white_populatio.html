<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For the first time since the 1970s, a majority of Manhattan&rsquo;s population is non-Hispanic white, according to an analysis of census estimates.</p>
<p>The white share of the population, which had dipped to about 40 percent as recently as the 1990s, climbed to nearly 51 percent last year. The rest of the borough&rsquo;s residents were 24 percent Hispanic, 14 percent black and 11 percent Asian.</p>

		<p>This seems to be happening in many North American cities.  Basically, white liberals want to prove that they are urban and &#8220;hip,&#8221;  unlike all of those &#8220;racists&#8221; in the suburbs who misappropriate land and guzzle gas.  So they&rsquo;ve all decided to move downtown, in order to be close to the &#8220;joys&#8221; of diversity.  Unfortunately, their idea of multiculturalism is limited to either eating out at a Chinese restaurant or watching non-threatening blacks play the saxophone at a nearby jazz club.  Make no mistake about it; when this wonderful little experience ends, they all head back to the all-white condo, thinking the Mexican door-man who gets paid minimum wage is going to protect the Gringos property.  </p>
<p>But even in this multicultural utopia, all it will take is for one white police officer to &#8220;act stupidly&#8221; and a good ole&rsquo; fashioned race riot begins.  This is of course will be blamed on racist condo-dwellers who aren&rsquo;t paying their fair share in taxes to help these disadvantaged minorities. Once this happens, these so-called hipsters, who can&rsquo;t protect themselves because they thought only rednecks keep guns in their houses will be on the first U haul back to evil white suburbia.</p>
<p>I guess some people need to learn the hard way?</p>

		<p>&#8220;The rest of the borough&rsquo;s residents were 24 percent Hispanic.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the benefit of people in other parts of the country who think instinctively of Mexicans, those &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; are in this case nearly all Dominicans   &mdash;   who are nearly all blacks as well (to some degree). This gives Manhattan&rsquo;s blacks an actual total of nearly 38%.</p>

		<p> For a few paragraphs it looked as if the Times article was actually going to hail the return of a White majority to Manhattan as an unalloyed good. But, no, we should have known better.</p>
<p> Comes the borough president to throw cold water over the good news by saying that it appears Manhattan is becoming a haven for &#8220;the very, very rich&#8221; (read: White people) and &#8220;the poor&#8221; (read: minorities).</p>
<p> The rest of the article doesn&rsquo;t imply that only &#8220;very, very rich&#8221; White people are settling in Manhattan. I suspect the Times writer looked desperately for a Somebody In Authority figure who would give the liberal-approved, negative, &#8220;it&rsquo;s going to hurt poor black folk&#8221; slant to what is obviously good news.</p>

		<p>I have to say something here.  This city has been becoming progressively less White since the 1960&rsquo;s.  New York City consists of 5 boroughs.  When people in the suburbs use the phrase &#8220;living in the city&#8221;, they&rsquo;re referring to any one of the 5 boroughs.  When people outside of Manhattan but in one of the other 4 boroughs say &#8220;living in the city&#8221;, they&rsquo;re referring to Manhattan.  That being said I just want to state that Whites, especially Italians who used to live in Brooklyn now live in Staten Island - many that is.  Many also have fled the city for Westchester or Long Island or elsewhere.  These Whites that make up 51% of Manhattan are either very high income Whites, many of whom are liberals or are things like doctors, lawyers, dentists, etc., many of whom are Jewish.  It is well known that Jews do not consider themselves &#8220;White&#8221; as such.  Many of the Whites in Manhattan are also young people living in places like the East Village or Greenwich Village.  There are many that are married with no children and they both work so they can afford the relatively high rents.  </p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, which this article is NOT addressing is the borough of Queens.  The demographic changes in Queens over the course of the last 20 years are startling to say the least.  It is almost as if the county has been &#8216;taken over&rsquo; by non-Whites.  The White flight in Queens, New York is the greatest example of White flight, I think, of anywhere in the country.  The number of Orientals has risen incredibly, especially in places like Flushing.  The comments that John Rocker made 10 years ago about the #7 train are even more applicable today.  All one needs to do is drive through some neighborhoods that are currently &#8220;in transition&#8221;.  Every block it seems has numerous houses with &#8216;For Sale&rsquo; signs.  We&rsquo;ve learned through hard experience that if you&rsquo;re looking to buy a house in a certain area, and you see &#8216;For Sale&rsquo; signs all over the place, it is indicative of one thing, and that is that the neighborhood is becoming non-White.</p>

		<p>It seems to be true.  When I want to show my family where white people dominate, we go to Manhattan for the day.  (I live in an outer borough neighborhood that is trending Asian.)</p>
<p>The other day I passed through a black area of manhattan and then got out at a white area.  When I came out, it was whites everywhere!  I was amazed.  95% of the people I saw were white.  The other 5% were black nannies with their white kids (don&rsquo;t ask) and asian girls with white guys.</p>

		<p>There have been a number of articles discusing the return of many Whites to urban areas. The cities have more immediatate conveiences.</p>
<p>In fact, I was driving Harlem earlier this year. I must admit, I was shocked at the number of Whites I saw. Ten to fifteen years ago, Harlem was predominately Black. My second cousin and his family were among the very few Whites who lived there. </p>
<p>I saw people rollerblading, starbucks on several corners, upscale bistros, trendy bakeries, Fed-ex Kinkos stores, young yuppie White, Black and Hispanic mothers with strollers walking with one another. Integrated groups of young people hanging out together on patios and terraces in various coffehouses and restaurants.    </p>
<p>I do not know if this is exclusive to Harlem, but it (Harlem) has certianly undergone a racial and economic transformation. For all I know, like Manhattan, Whites may become a majority in Harlem before long. </p>

		<p>  This is probably only a temporary trend. With the decline of Wall Street and the financial sectors, New York City will once again begin to resemble a Third World City. Unless our financial system is put in order, high crime, unreliable utilizes and services and a bankrupt city government are the future for New York City.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Ha!  Sounds like you got out in my neighborhood. Well, except for the Asians. (Not too many of them here.)</p>
<p>But the point must be made that New York and Manhattan, while the same, are also two very different things, in some ways.</p>
<p>As John E. mentioned, NY has the 5th lowest crime rate among large American cities, but I wonder what it is for Manhattan alone?  And then, if you subtract Harlem and the large Dominican areas, what is it for the remainder which is white?  Probably VERY low!   This is why many prominent and wealthy white people live here&hellip; as well as many wealthy foreigners from around the world. They know what is what. </p>
<p>I should also mention that since Bill Clinton established  his office on 125th Street, in Harlem, there is impressive development going on there, all along 125th St.   &mdash;   new department stores, banks, redevelopment everywhere to be seen. And many white faces on the street too.</p>
<p>I personally knew two neighbors, a charming young white couple, musicians with the Philharmonic, who bought an old mansion or townhouse on 145th St. with the objective of restoring it. This was going to be a tremendous job, lasting for years into the future.  (Harlem has many fine old buildings that were once quite grand, when it was white.)  I used to love to hear them practice, and  I was worried about their move.  I haven&rsquo;t heard  anything of them since, for several years now. I hope they are doing well and haven&rsquo;t been murdered.  That is the risk you take when you move into a neighborhood like that. </p>

When I am in a neighborhood dominated by Orientals I feel safe.  When I am in a neighborhood dominated by a minority I do not need to name, I feel the imminence of violent street crime.  Orientals deserve their description as &#8220;the ideal minority.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This seems to be true in many upscale places in New York. I was in a starbucks in Manhattan the other day. I was with my two grandsons and in walked two young mothers. One was White and the other was Black. The White mother had a boy and a girl. The Black mother had two girls. All of the kids looked to be between 4 and 8 years old. Both women were very attractive. I was close enough to the counter where I heard them make some comments about their husbands good jobs, good private schools, upcoming vacations and some other things. </p>
<p>They ordered drinks for their children, themselves and went and sat in the cozy chairs in the east section of the coffeeshop. </p>

		<p>This is very good news, yet it does come with the caveat that these &#8220;Whites&#8221; are generally not of Anglo nordic stock. It is no secret that these caucasians are essentially Jewish, which is fine in the sense that they make for wonderful neighbors and have contributed enormously to advancements in Western Civilization in a highly dispropotionate way juxtaposed to their mere three percent of nation&rsquo;s population. We also know that this community enjoys very high representation in all areas of prestige, and they often tangibly influence public policy (such as immigration laws and trends) that end up being harmful to the majority of (non-Jewish) Whites that now only make up around sixty-seven percent of the nation&rsquo;s population  &mdash;  down from the nearly eighty percent of the 1960&rsquo;s. The only Whites in Manhattan are essentially the tourists from well outside the NYC metro area  &mdash;  -along with a shrinking handful of waspy Wall Street commuters from Long Island and Connecticut.  </p>

		<p>When I first moved here (I don&rsquo;t live in Manhattan), I quickly picked up on which neighborhoods to avoid; I&rsquo;m fortunate to live in an area without so many blacks, and to work in an area of Manhattan with even fewer. However, as others have mentioned, most of this white population is composed of Jews and Eastern European immigrants. The actual white Americans (and apparently there are even fewer than I had originally thought) are overwhelmingly degenerate. I never see the Jews and Russians with mulatto or adopted black children, or hanging the homo flag on their windows, like I do in many white Manhattan neighborhoods. The city certainly does combine the worst aspects of society. I&rsquo;m pleasantly surprised that there are any racially conscious New Yorkers at all.</p>

		<p>While it may be true that Manhattan is getting whiter (and richer, btw), and I can see that happening,  I am suspicious of posters who emphasize the happy inter-racial relationships among upper-income, highly educated blacks and their happy white neighbors who are delighted to live and socialize with them.  I don&rsquo;t think so.  I don&rsquo;t see any of that. It&rsquo;s a rarity.  White is still white and black is still black. New York remains still New York.</p>

		<p>Never been there but I can&rsquo;t imagine they have much in the way of &#8220;affordable housing.&#8221;  So of course it&rsquo;s trending white, like a number of major American cities.  No one else can afford it.</p>
<p>Someone touched on the reason in a previous comment.  It&rsquo;s because the suburbs are now bad.  Land-use doesn&rsquo;t fit the new liberal building codes of &#8220;must be able to reach out your window and touch your neighbor&rsquo;s house.&#8221;</p>
<p>And even though a Prius gets great mileage, it still uses more gas commuting 15 miles than 2 miles.  &#8220;Work and play where you live&#8221; is the new motto of the green types.  </p>
<p>Here in western WA I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve built a new highway in 25+ years.  They&rsquo;re actually talking about taking away a main highway that runs through Seattle.  More people + fewer lanes = disaster.  </p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re dealing with people who refused to put salt down on compact snow &amp; ice for a week because the run off could have changed the salinity of the watersheds &amp; Puget Sound and harm the salmon, that were doing fine by the way until they started letting the Indians net across the entire river and sit in the bar waiting for the nets to fill up.  </p>
<p>That part never gets out though, they just blame the dams that have been on the rivers for 70 years or more for a problem that&rsquo;s just about as old as the Boldt decision that gave 50 percent of the fisheries to the roughly 2 percent of fishermen who are native.</p>
<p>Sorry about the rant.  If you can afford to live in Seattle and actually have the desire, you&rsquo;re probably a white leftist who feels people should get around on bikes, use public transportation, or just walk.  You have the extra 2+ hours a day right?  Just stay in for a week when it snows, and never mind the 9 months out of the year that it rains cats and dogs.  It&rsquo;s for the environment!</p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen a white bank teller, or manager or other bank employee, in years.  Much less a white male.  No such thing!   It&rsquo;s so long that I can&rsquo;t even remember one. In my neighborhood, however, there are many recently  arrived Russian Jews. </p>
<p>Yesterday, I went into my bank and needed to speak about an outdated check that I had forgotten to cash. I was directed to have a seat at the desk of a pleasant young white man!   I was amazed, and thought, &#8220;Oh, they&rsquo;ve started hiring white people now!&#8221;   But it soon became evident, from his distinct accent, that he was Russian. Then it dawned on me that the only reason he was there was to accommodate the Russian-speaking clientele.  If he hadn&rsquo;t been Russian, he wouldn&rsquo;t have had a chance in hell of having that job. </p>

<p>You may not see any interracial interaction taking place among upscale Blacks and Whites and Hispanics, but as someone who travels through many boroughs in New York City, however, I certainly do especially among the under 35 crowd and apparently so do a number of other posters who have made comments. No one said that everyone in Manhattan, Harlem or other boroughs involved in interracial friendships or relationships, but there are enough people who are that it is notable.</p>
<p>Secondly, what do you mean by &#8220;White is still White and Black is still Black?&#8221; Tha&rsquo;s like saying Male is still Male and Female is still female. However, both genders are involved with one another.</p>

		<p>One thing no body bothered to mention in these comment section is the fact A LOT of these whites who live in Manhattan tend to be the faux hipster types who are very left leaning and have minimal career prospects.  Along with the pompous yuppies, most of the Manhattan whites do NOT have kids and are more preoccupied with sleeping around than starting families.  It&rsquo;s almost like a false paradise that will inevitably lead to extinction! </p>

If I was a white parent who wanted grandkids, the last places I would want my kids to live in is Manhattan.  </p>

<p>You are wrong. Alot of the leftist hipsters in Manhattan come from very upscale backgrounds. In fact, most of them are trust fund babies who can afford to loaf and engage in a bohemian lifestyle around Manhattan, Seattle and other urban areas.  </p>

<p>Sorry, but you are being disingenuous.</p>
