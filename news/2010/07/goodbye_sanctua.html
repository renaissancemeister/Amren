<h1>Goodbye &#8216;Sanctuary&rsquo; Cities</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William P. Cook, Wall Street Journal, July 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Judge Bolton let stand A.R.S. § 11-1051(A), which prohibits Arizona officials, agencies and political subdivisions from limiting enforcement of federal immigration laws. A.R.S. § 11-1051(C)-(F), which requires that state officials work with federal officials with regard to aliens unlawfully in the state, will also remain in force.</p>
<p>Her ruling  &mdash;  provided it is adopted by other courts across the country  &mdash;  will drive a stake into the heart of the &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; movement among cities and towns that feel they have the authority to disregard federal law. Right now, they permit illegal aliens to freely reside within their borders and have access to various benefits that should only be reserved for those here lawfully.</p>
<p>Many local governments  &mdash;  mostly vocally San Francisco, but also Phoenix, Mesa, Chandler and Tucson  &mdash;  have conducted themselves as &#8220;sanctuaries.&#8221; As such, they have directed law enforcement personnel within their domains not to cooperate with state or federal law enforcement in the proper handling, including processing for deportation, of illegal immigrants. {snip}</p>
<p>The court also left unchanged the provision that permits legal residents of Arizona to sue any state official, agency or political subdivision for not enforcing federal immigration laws to the full extent permitted. {snip}</p>
<p>In addition, Judge Bolton refused to halt the implementation of a variety of amendments to existing Arizona law  &mdash;  those that pertain to the state&rsquo;s right to control employment within its borders by regulating employers:</p>
<p>* A.R.S. § 13-2928(A)-(B): creating a crime for stopping a motor vehicle to pick up day laborers and for day laborers to get in a motor vehicle if it impedes the normal movement of traffic;</p>
<p>* A.R.S. § 23-212: amending the crime of knowingly employing unauthorized aliens;</p>
<p>* A.R.S. § 23-214: amending the requirements for checking employment eligibility.</p>
<p>{snip} First, there is an amendment that would make transporting or harboring an illegal alien an additional offense for a person who has committed another crime (A.R.S. § 13-2929). {snip}</p>

		<p>This would be great news&hellip;.if there were the legitimate rule of law within the US at the federal level.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t&hellip;..which is the point of what is going on in Arizona.</p>
<p>The US is rapidly splitting into two types of states&hellip;.non-white kleptocracies that are strongly racist against whites&hellip;..and white states where whites insist on the rule of law and more and more are waking up to the reality of what non-whites are and what needs to be done to preserve a first world existence.</p>
<p>Soon, the tax links between the two will be severed.  It may or may not be put in these terms.  More likely it will be the advancement of the fair tax act followed by moves in the states to keep that money in the state and NOT redistributed to the anti-white states.</p>
<p>Will there be seccession?  Civil War?  Probably not.  Such things are done between equals fighting it out as to who is top dog.  The two sides are NOT equals.  I suspect a slow &#8220;soft&#8221; seccession and economic/racial migration.  The issue of race makes it unlikely that any real border, let alone some sort of iron curtain, will be necessary.  Once diffusion of consequences is eliminated, most whites simply won&rsquo;t cooperate with non-whites or with liberal whites.</p>
<p>The whole unjust system we have currently is built and maintained on the backs of the productive white person.  ONLY his cooperation maintains the system.  That cooperation is disintegrating.</p>

		<p>What is strange is that the DOJ didn&rsquo;t even challenge this provision, yet they challenged the pullover-and-check part of the law, based on the excuse that it would overburden ICE.  Well, ending sanctuary cities in Arizona will also create a lot of work for ICE.</p>

<p>Well, there is a bit of good news!</p>
<p>The only problem I have with this, is that it is focused on the disregard of &ldquo;federal law&rdquo; and not state laws dealing with the alien invader question. The states, not the feds, should be the primary focus of the enforcement of laws in municipalities. Using the logic of a tiered system of &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; governance, the feds should only be concerned with their ability to broadly and equitably regulate the states, not smaller units such as counties or cities. Of course, I also believe that the feds should have extremely limited powers over the states, when it comes to the rights of association and residency. By this, I mean that the states should have the right and power to dictate who comes into their geographical jurisdiction or be removed from it, when citizenship is at best a questionable or illegal variable.</p>
<p>Thus, for example, the feds can grant their &ldquo;amnesties&rdquo; and the cites can declare themselves &ldquo;sanctuaries,&rdquo; but the states should have the authority to override both when it comes to allowing actual residency. If the states choose to penalize or even expel them, that should be their exclusive right.</p>
<p>These are not citizens in any state, they are invaders, as are their children whelped onto our soil; they do not have &ldquo;rights,&rdquo; even if a president or a mayor says that they do!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always believed the key to fixing this mess was in cracking down on employers and housing. If someone doesn&rsquo;t have a job or a place to live they&rsquo;ll leave. They&rsquo;ll have to. Governments can make illegals &#8220;self deport&#8221; without ever even arresting one.</p>

		<p>Could it be happening, that the dreaded and much despised by the outside World South African policy of Apartheid will be adopted in the USA?  What a turnaround if this happens as there are apparently some African American organisations demanding this already - Afrika Rising is one I have found on the Internet.  They want three complete US States to be declared black run.</p>
<p>As someone who lived in south Africa for 23 years but was born in Britain, served in the military for Britain (the Royal air Force) I despaired that many outside of Africa did not know the real reason for Apartheid.  It was to ensure that the white Africans who have every much as anyone else who had lived there for hundreds of years, to be called African to be able to protect themselves from the sad fate that have befallen other countries in Africa that have been given their freedom and subsequently regressed to the conditions that existed before the Europeans arrived in their space-ships (sailing boats) in the 16th-17th Centuries.<br>
I used to be very upset at the Indian Government who were very actively anti-Apartheid but even still yet as shown in the film &#8220;Slum Dog Millionaire&#8221;, the living conditions for many Indians are far worse that they were for any black people under Apartheid.  Only now after nearly 20 years of &#8220;freedom&#8221; under a Marxist-trained, ex-terrorist South African Government are such conditions being experienced there.  But the new leaders are living in luxury.  After all as one famously said &#8220;I did not fight (murder and kill women and children including many blacks who resisted their methods) for 20 years to be poor when we won.</p>
<p>But hypocrisy is one of the propaganda methods used by those who do not want just a piece of the action, they want it all, so that could be the fate awaiting the USA, IF YOU WEAKEN.   Success must be earned not grabbed.</p>
<p>As my old employer, Joe Bamford of earthmoving equipment manafacturing fame once said to me, &#8220;Never give anything of value to even your children.  They must do something to earn it so they really appreciate what they have.&#8221;</p>

___</p>
<p>Exactly!   And, ideally,  also remove those defiant officials from office and put them in jail. Let them learn that they are minor officials, not haughty potentates.  I&rsquo;d dearly love to see their surprised faces looking out from behind bars.  </p>
<p>But, at the very least, we can cut off the money. That alone should do it.</p>

		<p>I agree with fred at comment #5. If employers who hire illegals were to face stiff fines, it would be too great an economic risk to hire them. Since most do come to work, they would no longer come if there were no work for them.</p>
<p>The situation we have now exists because those who profit by hiring illegals at lower wages without benefits so that such costs are socialized thereby adding to the profit margin of these businesses, are controlling the government.</p>
<p>Remember the form of government everywhere is a kakistocracy.<br>

<p>That will fix SOME of the problem, but not all.  People involved in drugs and crime won&rsquo;t care in the least.  Plenty of small, private employers won&rsquo;t care (  &mdash;   are you going to get arrested for paying someone who offers to mow your lawn?)  And mothers of US-citizen babies and other such opportunists will find loopholes.<br>

		<p>If you want to get rid of illegals, get rid of the minimum wage laws that make it impossible to pay some people what they&rsquo;re truly worth, and get rid of the welfare programs that support those who&rsquo;s labor isn&rsquo;t worth minimum wage.  </p>
<p>THIS is the real reason why there&rsquo;s a &#8220;labor shortage.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s a result of government meddling in the economy distorting supply-and-demand signals, like just about every other economic problem in this country.  Government won&rsquo;t relax min. wage laws because they&rsquo;re still effective politically.  Their business friends complain that they can&rsquo;t find anyone to do menial work when government makes it too expensive to hire them, that&rsquo;s when they can get anyone out of the welfare line to come down and apply in the first place.  </p>
<p>Solution?  Cheap labor streams over the border, business hires them, government looks the other way.  We have a steady supply of ditch-diggers and toilet-scrubbers, welfare programs stay in place to keep them voting Democrat, win-win situation for the ruling elite.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as a job that Americans won&rsquo;t do.  There&rsquo;s only Americans who won&rsquo;t work at menial jobs for $7/hr when they can get paid more by the government to sit around.  End the gravy train, lock up the border, and make these lazy people compete in the labor markets.</p>

		<p>With this ban on sanctuary cities, perhaps tax payers could sue locally to recover money spent in the interest of illegals in violation of federal law.  Any creative thinking lawyers out there?  As a Cook County tax payer,Chicago is in Cook County for you outsiders, I would love to be part of a class-action suit and I&rsquo;m sure many others here would also.  This might be another avenue of attack we can take all over the country.  Win or not, if we start costing these santuary cities some money in legal fees, maybe they will start backing down on this santuary nonsense, if for no other reason than money.  We know all these sanctuary cities are going broke already.</p>

		<p>The federal government can keep states from enforcing immigration laws. But the federal government can&rsquo;t stop states from going after those who hire illegals. That&rsquo;s actually one of the amendments that Judge Bolton refused to halt. </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy for politicians to sell, too. Just think of the way it&rsquo;s percieved. It just sounds so much nicer to &#8220;crack down on businesses who exploit illegals&#8221; versus &#8220;harrassing the hardworking folks who do the jobs americans won&rsquo;t do&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Republicans like to demagogue this issue, but the main concern of the GOP is the economic well being of employers, landlords, and investors.  If you get your income from interest, rent, and dividends, you benefit from a high rate of immigration, and the Republican Party cares about you.<br>

		<p>What would happen to a city that had its federal aid cut off?</p>
<p>It would immediately collapse.</p>
<p>The &#8220;federal government&#8221; could easily force &#8220;sanctuary cities&#8221; to comply with &#8220;federal law&#8221;.</p>
<p>If any of that was legitimate, that is.  If any of our tax money was used for any legitimate purpose whatsoever.</p>
<p>At this point, completely dissolving the federal government, ending all taxes and ending everything the federal government spends money on would solve most problems (especially race problems) in the US and have no negatives whatsoever.</p>

		<p>&#8220;When the diffusion of consequences is eliminated, most whites simply won&rsquo;t cooperate with non-whites or with liberal whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think about this sometimes.  I don&rsquo;t like the thoughts I&rsquo;m having.  It seems like I would be giving up if I took on the opinion that my government no longer represents me.</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m living, I, as a white male over 35 am a minority.  The majority of the people around me are blacks and latinos and Asians of various kinds.  Some are nice, some are not - people are people - but I see all those groups living only for the interests of their groups.</p>
<p>The promise of integration and multiculturalism and diversity doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working out as they told us it would.</p>
<p>I see each ethnic group getting some power in this or that government agency or department or neighborhood and then using that power to advance their own narrow interests, others be damned.</p>
<p>How can I cooperate with the dispossion of my race, my people, in the land of my forefathers?  I see young liberal whites who live in an Avatar fantasy land of &#8216;keepin&rsquo; it real,&rsquo; and walk around wearing berkenstocks, african shawls and ethnic looking bracelets and such, and I see they unconsciously use their &#8216;white priviledge&rsquo; by being the hip and with it white in a room full of non-whites.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actual white children but once in a great while.  It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;ve stopped producing.  Nearly all white people i see are 25+ of age, but everywhere I look I see hordes of latino babies, a few black and asian ones and that&rsquo;s all there is.</p>
<p>100 years from now, 50 years from now, my country will belong to another people - another people who did not fight us or win against us in a war, but a people who slipped in through the cracks to live off our bloated lifestyle.</p>
<p>Strange thoughts I have these days.  I also wonder when whites will become so fed up that they stop cooperating with non-whites.  Then again, even after everything that has happened in South Africa, the bulk of the whites still live around non-whites, employ them and embrace them, even if they sleep behind walls at night.</p>

<p>Fascinating. I never thought of the issue in quite those terms. It certainly explains the GOP&rsquo;s fecklessness. And why a new party is needed. </p>
