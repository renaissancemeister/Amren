<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On the day of President Obama&rsquo;s immigration reform speech, several advocacy groups launched a campaign urging Major League Baseball move next summer&rsquo;s All-Star Game from Phoenix.</p>
<p>The 2011 All-Star Game is currently scheduled to take place in Arizona, a state that signed its controversial immigration bill into law this past April. {snip}</p>
<p>The campaign, directed at MLB Commissioner Bud Selig, was launched as a joint effort by some civil rights groups such as the National Council of La Raza, Asian American Justice Center, Center for Community Change, League of United Latin American Citizens, and the National Puerto Rican Coalition.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The web site said baseball is a game &#8220;that transcends all barriers and brings America together, reminding us of what makes us unique: our diversity.&#8221; The site also said America&rsquo;s favorite pastime &#8220;is in danger of losing its reputation,&#8221; if the game is held in Arizona.<br>

		<p>The gauntlet has been thrown down. This is turning into a full-on fight.</p>
<p>Real Americans should be threatening to punish Major League Baseball if it caves in to these treasonous, anti-American pressure groups.</p>
<p>Americans opposed to the boycott should be forming national groups, with national government charters, to fight for the rights of Americans.</p>

<p>I think that ship already set sail in 1994.</p>

		<p>I find it amusing that the article refers to La Raza as a &#8220;civil rights group.&#8221;  </p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how MLB Commissioner Bud Selig handles this matter.  On the one hand, Selig is a hard-core leftist (google his political campaign contributions), but on the other he realizes that his foreign dominated/steroid-soaked product is beginning to wear thin with the people who fill MLB&rsquo;s coffers (middle-class whites).<br>

		<p>Surely ye jest, but I will elaborate.</p>
<p>1994 is when the final third of the regular season and the entire post-season, including the World Series, was wiped out because billionaires and multi-millionaires, plus a few six-figure paupers, couldn&rsquo;t settle with their big brouhaha over money in order to continue their &#8220;industry.&#8221;  Thereby alienating the average fan, who won&rsquo;t see as much money in one lifetime as some of today&rsquo;s current players inject up their posteriors in steroids over their careers.</p>

<p>No one really has any idea what the phrase &#8220;civil rights&#8221; actually means any more.  The media have twisted it through repetition into meaning &#8220;any organization dedicated to giving nonWhites more power and taking power from Whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Any racially-exclusive group made up of nonWhites is a &#8220;civil rights group.&#8221;  Any racially-exclusive group made up of Whites is a &#8220;hate group&#8221; that must be destroyed at any cost.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;d love to say I will boycott MLB if they do pull this game, but I gave up on baseball years ago expressly BECAUSE of their outrageous Hispanicization of the entire league!! Rather ironic when you think about it&hellip;</p>

Thanks for answering my question. And it brought to mind a neighbor I knew well enough  once to say hello to. Every day I would walk past his house to get to the store nearby. The guy was one of those yard freaks. Always pruning, raking and especially watering. Well one week he was out every day as usual. And listening to the World Series from a radio blaring from the garage. On every big play his wife would race out the door and tell him about it as she was  also glued to the T.V. inside.<br>
 Finally after about three days of this, or should I say three games, I asked him, &#8220;What is the #$%@&*% deal with you all and the World Series?!?&#8221; He never answered, but just moved his hose hand  enough for me to notice a large ornate ring on it. I walked off thinking that just about  everyone has a story that people don`t know and never hear&hellip;</p>
