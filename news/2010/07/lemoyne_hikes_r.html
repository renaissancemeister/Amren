<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Lemoyne hiked nonmember rates at the borough pool on Monday, citing overcrowding. The move came on the heels of a Borough Council meeting last week at which four residents complained about behavioral problems, particularly involving minorities.</p>
<p>Resident Sharon Hernley, speaking at the council meeting Thursday, said some of the lifeguards are afraid to discipline minorities for fear of what she termed &#8220;the race card.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hernley said the council should expect to get calls accusing her of being a racist, but she added: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t care. Bring it on.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other complaints were about foul language, rough-housing and failing to listen to lifeguards.</p>
<p>On Thursday, resident Jay Stark told the Borough Council that there is an &#8220;attitude of aggression&#8221; and a &#8220;very unpleasant atmosphere&#8221; at the pool, which he attributed to people from outside the borough.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The committee also decided that the pool management should limit the pool capacity to 260, down from the 293 allowed now, and stop walk-ins after 230 patrons to leave room for members.</p>
<p>West Shore Regional Police officers have started more patrols through the pool area, and committee members told lifeguards who feel threatened by patrons to call police. Police said they have not been called to the pool often.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Residents at Monday&rsquo;s meeting did not raise any race issues.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Committee and council member Dave Beasley said the borough should not be afraid of racial profiling accusations if incidents of bad behavior are well-documented.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some African-American leaders in the Harrisburg area said Monday that they were appalled at the residents&rsquo; comments.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is ignorance, the kind of ignorance we have been fighting for years,&#8221; said Stanley Lawson, the president of the Greater Harrisburg Branch of the NAACP. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not based on facts or reality. It&rsquo;s very dangerous, and I reject it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lawson, who was the Dauphin County Republican Party&rsquo;s first black chairman and who has served as the president of the Susquehanna Twp. commissioners, said he expected better of the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a great country with great people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have our boys in Afghanistan, black and white, side by side, dying for our country. Then we have people here perpetuating this attitude. That doesn&rsquo;t speak for all America, just a few people who feel that way. When I think of our boys fighting together, we should stop the nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patricia Gadsden, the editor and founder of Women Connect magazine and a member of the Gandhi King Peace Coalition, called the comments &#8220;unfortunate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We should have gotten past this. We keep continuing this sort of very separatist type of behavior and comments. People are in denial that there is prejudice and biases. Then everyone is affected. It&rsquo;s very disheartening,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gadsden also mentioned the &#8220;real divide&#8221; between the East Shore and the West Shore. &#8220;Some people are afraid to go across a bridge because of possible danger,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Calobe Jackson Jr., a Harrisburg historian and former Harrisburg School Board member, recommended that the lifeguards be given sensitivity training.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that the lifeguards have to practice discipline on an equal basis and apply the rules evenly to everyone,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It looks like they already have problems. [Racial] problems with pools go way back.&#8221;<br>

								<h2>Armed Guards at Pools After Lifeguard Attack</h2>
						<p>
							<i>WCBS-TV (New York City), July 13, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Armed security guards have been posted at public pools in Buffalo after a lifeguard was pulled into the water by rowdy teenagers and other unruly behavior prompted safety concerns for parks employees.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s eight public outdoor pools were shut down last Thursday after fights broke out and a locker room was vandalized.</p>
<p>At one pool, a 16-year-old lifeguard says she was yanked by her ankles into the water when she tried to restore order. She says she struck her head on a drain and then was repeatedly dunked by several teenagers until another lifeguard rescued her.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;problem&#8221; isn&rsquo;t &#8220;ignorance&#8221;; the pool patrons are all-too-familiar with black behavior, and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re so fed up that they&rsquo;re willing to be called racist.  </p>
<p>Until blacks are willing to point the fingers at themselves and fix the problems of their nasty, violent, thuggish ghetto offspring, there will continue to be racial problems.  These &#8220;tensions&#8221; are the fault of blacks.  Thug blacks and their intimidating black enablers at the NAACP and elsewhere.</p>

		<p>St. Louis City did something similar.  With city budget problems, it put up a $10 a month fee for people 18 and younger to use the city rec centers/pools, where before it was free for them.  (Over 18 has a $20 a month fee already, Over 65 has a $5 a month).  But after a lot of complaints, the city diverted money from a public safety sales tax, supposedly to hire more cops and update SLPD equipment, and gave it to the Parks/Rec division, so it could eliminate the U-18 fee.  The &#8220;rationale&#8221; used to divert police money to Parks/Rec was that getting kids into the rec centers and not letting them loiter on the streets would prevent crime.  (I guess they have no parents.)</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s goofy about that is that two years before voters voted for the &#8220;public safety&#8221; sales tax, they voted for a rec center sales tax.  The day after St. Louis beat Detroit in the 2006 World Series, St. Louis beat Detroit in the Morgan Quitno most dangerous cities survey.  The Mayor&rsquo;s office hypocritically said that MQ&rsquo;s methodology was wrong, then turned face and said it was right, we were the most dangerous, but the way to solve it was to run out and pass a sales tax for the city to build and renovate rec centers.  (So far, the only new rec center built with that money was a gift to the YMCA of a new building, in one of the safer parts of the city.  Pray tell, how will that deter as much as one violent crime?)  Why couldn&rsquo;t some of that money be used to keep U-18s from paying a fee?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise when blacks are in denial of their often loud, rude, criminal behavior, and it is standard operating procedure for tham to reject all of it when it occurs.  That&rsquo;s why other races really don&rsquo;t like to be where other blacks go.</p>
<p>It is difficult for blacks to recognize horrendous behavior when it is the norm they are accustomed to.</p>
<p>How can they condemn outrageous behavior when they don&rsquo;t know what outrageous behavior is?</p>

		<p>Until a few years ago, St Paul, MN, residents enjoyed the public pools located in nice residential neighborhoods of the city. Then their tax money began to be used to bus minority kids to the pools every summer afternoon. Besides exhibiting rude behavior, the minority kids had frequent intentional &#8220;accidents,&#8221; forcing the lifeguards to close the pools for 24 hours each time. Majority residents use the pools less often now and pool managers have reduced hours to compensate for fewer tickets sold.</p>

		<p>Here in Buffalo, they reopened some pools that had been closed for years because &#8216;the community&rsquo; demanded they be opened. And as predictable as the sunrise, black kids immediately began to act up.</p>
<p>Here is a video interview with parents and armed security guard. The parent even speculates that the incident my have been cause by the lifeguard playing with the kids. Keep in mind while you&rsquo;re watching this video that this security guard is going to be armed. This video is a classic and says it all:</p>

<p>BTW, a couple days ago, a white, blonde, female lifeguard saved a boy from drowning. No mention of the boys &#8216;social construct&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>About 40 years ago, a similar thing happened to us at a swimming center on a high school campus in the East Bay area in California.</p>
<p>On certain days, they first lowered the price, then made it &#8220;free swim&#8221; day.  What a disaster.</p>
<p>Needless to say, everybody came in from Oakland.  It was so unpleasant, everybody stayed away.</p>

<p>Well actually the &#8220;boys&#8221; doing the real dirty work are overwhelmingly white. And the real problem here is that blacks refuse to acknowledge that there are a lot and I mean a lot of black troublemakers. I worked at a condo complex that started to allow section 8 people to move in (almost all black and third worlders) that place went down very fast with break-ins, fights, prostitution etc and the pool areas were a constant source of trouble and uncleanliness.</p>

		<p>Public pools are always a source of trouble in minority neighborhoods. I have lived in apartments in mixed neighborhoods and while pool patrons tended to be majority white there were always a contingent of black troublemakers. Since kids under 12 had to have an adult watching them any adult by the pool without children was assaulted by black children requesting to be &#8220;watched&#8221; by the adult. And this was only the younger kids! Sensible white adults knew to stay away from the pool after dark, especially on a weekend. If the pool was closed it didn&rsquo;t matter, wild gangs of black kids would just jump the fence. Charging admission or selling memberships is the best way to avoid these problems. </p>

<p>We need a vocabulary to describe differential racial views that are based on experience and research.  The reflexive label of &#8220;ignorance&#8221; still has much more power than its content merits.</p>

<p>Yeah, SURE! If this NAACP hack  were plunked down at midnight in the &#8220;hood,&#8221; he&rsquo;s be soiling his trousers, doing a run for the border- to the closest cop shop, or a white neighborhood.<br>

		<p>The slippery slope has begun.</p>
<p>Patrons will be exclusively black within two years. The pool will be closed or resold in about another year after that.</p>
<p>This is a no- win situation for whites. If the white council insists on real control measures and when racial and inter-racial fights break out, here comes the media, federal probes and racial lawsuits. </p>
<p>Most white parents with young children have probably already made the decision to abandon after this coverage. The next to go will be the more stubborn teenagers. But too many fights, jumpings along with pretty blond girls getting groped or worse, will quickly result in retreat with them also.</p>
<p>Suburban communities which are reletively close to urban cores and in some instances, inner ring burbs&rsquo; need to consider proximity to black populations before opening pools with tax money. </p>
<p>As for the Valley Swim Club in Huntingdon Valley, PA,- they brought on their own problem for failure to screen, before excepting payment. </p>

		<p>White people create highly desirable areas.  White people have a unique personality and genetic makeup for this to happen.  Black people know of all the problems in the black community.  However, their personality of shifting blame overrides acknowledging realities.  They instead will blame &#8220;racist&#8221; white people for the actions of these black people abusing this 16 year old white female lifeguard.</p>

You need to let people all over America know that we white nationalists are out there, are not going anywhere, and aren&rsquo;t afraid of the truth. That will embolden others.</p>

		<p>I figured that almost all municipal pools closed years ago because of problems with blacks.  At the small WV city I live near, which is only 3% black, the city pool shut down several years ago due to, reportedly, lack of funds for maintenance.  The highly suspected reason was otherwise.  <br>
Since blacks left the South after the Civil War, they have often been tolerated only to be rejected a couple of decades or so later.  Obviously, their behavior or that of their children was so objectionable that they were driven out of towns and forced to settle in urban ghettos.  Now it appears that the same thing has happened when blacks were allowed into public pools, except that in the post-civil-rights-revolution era, it took a few decades longer for toleration to reach the absolute breaking point.  Now, even black children often act in violent opposition <br>
to authority.  Non-blacks are so fed up with black misbehavior that I expect social commentators to soon start speaking about the problem without use of vague terms or euphemisms.  People like Limbaugh, for instance, are so powerful that they can say practically anything and get away with it.</p>

		<p>I agree totally with comment number 11 however I wouldn&rsquo;t come right out with the &#8216;white nationalist&rsquo; narrative right away. There are always some very well thought out, intelligent commentary on all these various topics and I think that&rsquo;s the best way to approach all online discussions.</p>
<p>I would encourage others here to join all major MSM message boards as well as NYT, LA Times, Boston Globe, etc newspaper boards as well. It only takes a couple hours to sign up for several free email accounts and all the various message boards. You can just create a folder in your favorites to make it nice and convenient. (Please forgive me if most of you do this already.)</p>
<p>We are now at a time where native New Yorkers are being called racist for objecting to a 13 story mosque being put up next to the WTC and that is a sign that we are at a real tipping point and more and more white people are willing to stop participating in their own ethnic cleansing and more willing to embrace the truth about what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>My two cents</p>

<p><br>
No one ANYWHERE should EVER have to be afraid of racial profiling accusations if incidents of bad behavior are well-documented. This applies not just to the swimming pools of PA, but to all behaviors everywhere. If a behavior is well-documented&#8221;   &mdash;   i.e. true, factual, provable, etc   &mdash;   then it should be discussable. </p>
<p>Good old T. Jefferson made much the same point both earlier and better than me, of course, in a quote you can read at the top of this very page you&rsquo;re looking at right now. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to point out that for a race of people notoriously afraid of water, blacks sure cause a lot of trouble at public pools. </p>

		<p>The best deal going is a neighborhood pool owned by one&rsquo;s HOA.  Residents only.  One guest allowed per resident actually at the pool.  We went swimming at our HOA&rsquo;s pool yesterday evening at 8:30 and were the only ones there.  The only noise was the water circulation pump and birds in the surrounding trees.</p>

<p>Suit: City Recreation workers bribed for dangerous after-hours swims<br>
By CHRISTINE OLLEY<br>
Philadelphia Daily News</p>
<p>A teenage boy and his mother are suing the city, claiming that the 16-year-old nearly drowned after a Recreation Department worker took money to let a group of kids swim after hours.</p>
<p>The suit, filed last Friday in Common Pleas Court, seeks damages in excess of $50,000.</p>
<p>On one occasion, the illegal pool time almost turned tragic when Khalik Miller, 16, allegedly paid $2 to swim after hours with no lifeguards or supervision July 15, 2008, at the Awbury Recreation Center, in East Germantown.</p>
<p>Miller, who knew how to swim, was knocked unconscious after diving into the pool and hitting his head on the bottom, said his lawyer, I. Michael Luber.</p>
<p>After the group of about 30 kids were told their time was up and they began to leave, they told an unnamed pool worker that Miller was still in the pool and ran back to find him, according to the suit. Seeing him not moving, two girls dived in to pull Miller out and begin CPR, but the employee didn&rsquo;t help or call for medical help, according to the suit.<br>

		<p>  &#8220;Other complaints were about foul language, rough-housing and failing to listen to lifeguards.&#8221;<br>
&#8220;On Thursday, resident Jay Stark told the Borough Council that there is an &ldquo;attitude of aggression&rdquo; and a &ldquo;very unpleasant atmosphere&rdquo; at the pool, which he attributed to people from outside the borough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black culture is deeply centered on a tradition of perpetuated hatred for whites - handed down from generation to generation. According to these racial teachings, virtually everything negative or unfortunate that happens to blacks must be at its root the fault of evil racist whites. </p>
<p>When black adolescents exhibit foul behavior and hostile aggression they are enacting loyalty to the handed-down racial attitudes of their parents - by publicly demonstrating youthful rebellion against white &#8220;oppressors.&#8221;</p>
<p>We can thank decades of the leftist national presses&rsquo; reinforcement of the &#8220;rightness&#8221; of this attitude for leaving blacks with nothing but race resentment dominating their minds, and nothing but the word &#8220;racist&#8221; to answer what they don&rsquo;t like - and for the horrendous crime statistics which inevitably flow from this thoughtless incitement of left-fueled demagogic politics.        <br>

<p>I would strongly suggest that Dave either insist that video cameras be installed or have someone videotape a typical day at the pool, maybe several days  &mdash;  replete with aggressive behavior, foul language and refusal to listen to guards.</p>
<p>This is how a homeless shelter was closed in my community  &mdash;  a homeless shelter that was forced into a residential area near an elementary school and family park, with the furious residents being told by the idiots on the city council that shelter residents were harmless and would not be allowed in the park, near the school or near their homes and that they would be monitored at all times.</p>
<p>The video tapes, shown by a number of residents proved otherwise.</p>
<p>Invite Stanley Lawson, Patricia Gadsden and Calobe Jackson Jr. to the next council meeting and ask for their input and commentary on the tapes.</p>

		<p>Why not triple the rates for admission? I would pay the increase if I was a member. If it meant a significant decrease in minorities using the facilities. A better approach would be to privatize. Then the membership could consist of anyone desired by the members and anyone excluded as the membership saw fit. Privatization will become more attractive as the predicted increase in minorities in America becomes a reality. I  avoid minorities for the reasons given in the article. The comment from the NAACP about &#8220;ignorance&#8221; is the black way of saying you have to tolerate our barbaric behavior. I don&rsquo;t.  </p>

		<p>About 20 years ago 2 black children, both under 10 years old drowned in a Gary Indiana public swimming pool.  It was in early April, when the pool was still closed for the winter.  the pool was surrounded by a 15 feet high cyclone fence topped with barbed wire.</p>
<p>The pool is drained for the winter.  During the winter snow falls in and melts when the weather gets warm in April.  Frogs get there and lay eggs which hatch.  The black children in the neighborhood would cut holes in the fence, crawl through and catch the tadpoles to take home and boil and torture.</p>
<p>So these two, under 10 at night cut a hold in the fence and got into the pool.  The from the skid marks on the algae growth it was obvious that they got in the shallow end, got to close to the edge and slid down the cement into the deep end where they drowned in about 3 feet of water.</p>
<p>Now whose fault is that that the kids were out at night and cut through the fence?</p>
<p>And yes the parks district was aware of what the kids did and checked and repaired the fence on a regular basis.  But the only way to prevent this drowning would have been to have a security guard at the pool 24/7 from September to June when the swimming pool was closed for the winter.</p>

		<p>One solution would be to secretly video tape the goings on at the pools and play them for these people screaming about &#8220;racism&#8221;   Make sure that the videos are unedited and show raw footage of what is really going on. This should prove to the skeptics that there really is misbehavior and not just &#8220;racists&#8221; not wanting to share the pool with blacks or other minorities. The kid and mom playing the ghetto lottery after breaking the rules for an &#8220;after hours&#8221; swim is just about laughable. Most white kids would have had been punished for doing such a stupid thing instead of having their parents sue someone who should have been fired. </p>

<p>Unfortunately,  blacks - even when viewing the tapes - would fail to see anything seriously wrong with the behavior. Or they would dismiss it as just petty kid stuff that silly, fussy white people are making an unreasonable to-do about, just using it as an excuse to discriminate.  They never, never admit guilt or fault. </p>
<p>As said by others above, they have other standards and values  than whites, and that is the central problem. We just see things differently.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen how rowdy, rude and rough blacks are at public pools as a child and teenager back in the 1980&rsquo;s. There is no way I would allow a child of mine to be at such a place, not when white girls are groped, accosted, harassed or worse by hordes of ghetto thugs. As other posters have stated, I do not want to be around them, nor will I tolerate their ignorant and vile behavior towards me or my relatives. Swimming in a public pool is the same thing as swimming in the sewage as it arrives at the local wastewater treatment plant. Why do I want to expose myself or any children to the excrement these heathens intentionally put in the pool? I would gladly pay a high fee to be able to swim in pleasant, safe and clean surroundings without loud, aggressive and uncouth black children around who have zero respect for others or authority.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised places like swimming pools don&rsquo;t already have video cameras to cover up on liability.  Electronic gadgets get cheaper every year, and the video cameras are turning up all over as a result.  If Wal Mart can put them in its parking lot - people don&rsquo;t drown in parking lots - surely swimming pools can install them.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m offended that the Whites would even try to have fun at a swimming pool while there is still so much inequality and injustice remaining in this country.</p>
<p>Fun loving, liberty enjoying Whites are obstacles to the American Promise.</p>
<p>We must make the Whites more miserable so that our collective salvation will punish them for daring to violate human dignity by even having White children in the first place.</p>
<p>And what kind of Whites would even allow their children to swim in a pool with blacks?  That must be the cruelest of all forms of child abuse.</p>

		<p>When I was a kid in Cincinnati in the 70&rsquo;s-80&rsquo;s, there was a neighboring community which was around 90% black.  Our family trips would take us past their pool occasionally.  Despite being drained and refilled daily (at taxpayer expense) by afternoon, it was the color of the Amazon.  It usually contained around 30 black kids who would be &#8216;rough housing&rsquo; in a manner that made it appear more like an overcrowded exhibit, than a community pool.  How are we expected to live with these people?</p>

		<p>&#8220;I think that the lifeguards have to practice discipline on an equal basis and apply the rules evenly to everyone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It looks like they already have problems. [Racial] problems with pools go way back.&#8221;<br>
So a lifeguard should yell, &#8220;WALK!&#8221; at a white kid who is already walking?</p>
<p>What a moron.</p>

<p>Of course, LOL!</p>
<p>Or, they will claim the tapes are doctored  &mdash;  you know how crafty they think old White is and are positive THE MAN will do anything to &#8216;bring down a black man!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Increasingly in the schools, and especially on school buses, digital cameras are being installed-and they do work to a certain extent, especially the ones on the bus. But then, school bus drivers (most of whom are black) have a lot more power than teachers.</p>
<p>When caught committing a felony on the the school camera  &mdash;  such as a sexual assault, classroom break-in or drug sale, the black kid will claim:  &#8216;That ain&rsquo;t me!&rsquo; even when he&rsquo;s wearing the exact same clothing as shown on the tape.</p>
<p>Blacks, as you stated, see things far differently than we do  &mdash;  they actually believe that Whites still oppress and keep them down instead of noticing the trillions of White-earned tax dollars that have been thrown at their feet and the unearned privileges and perks that have been showered on them.</p>
<p>Yet they still believe that we are White Devils. </p>
<p>How little they realize how expendable they are and when their role as battering ram against Whites is complete, they&rsquo;ll be the first to go in the NWO.</p>

Typical!  I can&rsquo;t tell you the number of times I&rsquo;ve seen a black perp, covered with blood, brought into the station house, yelling  (a la Prof. Henry Gates): &#8220;I did not stab that bitch!  I never saw that knife before. This is all a set up. Those cops put that knife on me. I never touched her. She had it coming anyway.&#8221;</p>
