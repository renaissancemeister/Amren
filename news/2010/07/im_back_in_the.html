<h1>I&rsquo;m Back in the Political Fray and in the Fight Against Illegal Immigration .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And I Need Your Help!</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tancredo for Governor 2010, July 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dear fellow conservative,</p>
<p>As a longtime partner with me in the battle to secure our nation&rsquo;s borders and stop the scourge of illegal immigration, I want you to be among the first to know that this week I filed my papers as a candidate for governor of Colorado.</p>
<p>I am running for governor in part because the leading Republican candidates for governor are both enmeshed in serious ethical and financial scandals that not only reflect badly on their character, but that are so bad they also guarantee the election of the Democratic candidate, liberal Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper.</p>
<p>And John Hickenlooper, just like Barack Obama, is committed to the &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; and open-border policies that have made Colorado a front-line state in the illegal immigration wars!</p>
<p>As a Coloradan, I can&rsquo;t stand by and let the ethical failings of the leading Republican candidates just hand the governorship over to a Democrat who is wrong on every single issue of importance to our state .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not just illegal immigration, but also taxes and government spending.</p>
<p>Today, as a patriot who shares my commitment to the cause of reclaiming our nation for our people and our values, I am asking you to join my campaign.</p>
<p><i>Will you help me by making an online contribution to &#8220;Tancredo for Governor 2010?&#8221;</i> (<a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/4458648:6669348654:m:4:200582805:9E2433CD86EBF2B69AABA166B9390282" target="donation" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>Click here.</b></a>) With just three months to go until the election, time is of the essence!</p>
<p>The maximum contribution you can make under Colorado law is $525. If you can <i>make a contribution</i> (<a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/4458648:6669348654:m:4:200582805:9E2433CD86EBF2B69AABA166B9390282" target="donation" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>click here</b></a>) for $525 today, I would be so grateful because that would really kick off our campaign dramatically!</p>
<p>But I also would be grateful for your contribution of $400, $250, $100 or even $50 today. John Hickenlooper has been running for governor for months and I need to hit the ground running this week!</p>
<p>Colorado is facing many challenges today, just like most states. I served in the Colorado Legislature for ten years before going to Congress, and I know how to make state government work for the people by applying solid conservative principles of governance.</p>
<p>And as the battle over illegal immigration has moved from Washington DC to the states, it is going to be critically important to our cause to elect men and women as governors who are committed to standing up against Barack Obama and enforcing our laws against illegal immigration.</p>
<p>We are seeing a great example of that commitment to the rule of law in Arizona, and I can pledge to you that I will fight that same battle in Colorado!</p>
<p>I deeply appreciate your friendship and your commitment to our cause. <i>I hope that you will stand with me once again</i> (<a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/4458648:6669348654:m:4:200582805:9E2433CD86EBF2B69AABA166B9390282" target="donation" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>click here</b></a>).</p>
<p>Many Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom Tancredo</p>
<p>P.S. I really can&rsquo;t overstate how much I am relying on friends like you <i>to help me with your best gift today</i> (<a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/4458648:6669348654:m:4:200582805:9E2433CD86EBF2B69AABA166B9390282" target="donation" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>click here.</b></a>).</p>
<p>The election is just three months away and although I have great name recognition here in Colorado, I still need to rapidly put together our campaign team and materials! <i>Please let me hear from you soon</i> (<a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/4458648:6669348654:m:4:200582805:9E2433CD86EBF2B69AABA166B9390282" target="donation" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>click here</b></a>)!</p>

								<h2>Tom Tancredo Announces Constitution Party Candidacy for Governor of Colorado!</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Colorado Election Special Edition, Constitution Party, July 26, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>From: USA Today:</p>
<p>&#8220;I will officially announce at noon that I will seek the nomination of the Constitution Party,&#8221; Tancredo told the Post.</p>
<p>Ex-congressman Tom Tancredo has entered the race for Colorado governor as a third-party candidate, setting off a nasty battle among Republicans in this political bellwether state, The Denver Post reports.</p>
<p>Tancredo will make the formal announcement of his candidacy later today as a member of the American Constitution Party, the paper reports. Tancredo served five terms in Congress as a Republican and briefly ran for the GOP presidential nomination in 2008 on a platform that focused on stopping illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Tancredo, in a radio appearance today, said he was trying to do &#8220;my level best to do what&rsquo;s necessary for the conservatives in this state&#8221; by entering the race.</p>
<p>As our colleague Kathy Kiely noted last week, the Republican establishment disagrees with Tancredo&rsquo;s move. Colorado Republican Party Chairman Dick Wadhams has warned that Tancredo&rsquo;s bid will throw the governorship to Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper, the Democrat who is running unopposed for his party&rsquo;s nomination.</p>
<p>Trancredo had warned the two Republican contenders, Scott McInnis and Dan Maes, that he would enter the contest if they refused to end their campaigns after the primary if polls showed the winner falling behind Hickenlooper.</p>
<p>According to The Denver Post, Wadhams and Tancredo had an &#8220;all-out brawl&#8221; on a Colorado radio station this morning and called one another liars. On Sunday, the leaders of nearly two dozen Tea Party groups also asked Tancredo to refrain from entering the race.</p>
<p>In a letter, they urged Tancredo to &#8220;stay in the Republican Party, let the process play out for the governor&rsquo;s race.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In other words, to trust and respect the newly awakened, energized and informed voters of Colorado.&#8221;</p>
<p>[This is just one of a number of national news media stories breaking at this moment on the Tancredo Constitution Party Gubernatorial Candidacy in Colorado]</p>
<p>Note:  The American Constitution Party is the official name of the Colorado state affiliate of the Constitution Party.<br>

		<p>I would caution the readers of AR about Tom Tancredo.   In February of 2010, while being interviewed by Alan Colmes on TV, Tancredo was asked by Colmes if he was concerned about an America that was, say, 35 to 40 percent Hispanic.   Tancredo squirmed and started muttering that &#8216;no, he did not think it terms of race and he saw NO PROBLEM with an America that was 40% Hispanic.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>Face facts, AR readers.  An America that would become 40% Hispanic is an America that has been invaded, colonized, and stolen from the Founding European people who&rsquo;s ancestors founded and created this nation and who fully intended to pass it on to THEIR EUROPEAN posterity.    Tom Tancredo is no White Knight, riding in on a White Horse to save this nation from being stolen and turned into Mexico El Norte. </p>
<p>One other thing about Tancredo - he is a flaming neo-con when it comes to fighting wars that are not in the best interests of Americans, and most particularly - are not in the best interests of White men (or women or their children), who are being slaughtered in these neo-con meat grinders that only benefit one specific foreign nation.    These neo-con forces have been trying to find a way to infiltrate the Constitution Party and transform it into a mirror image of the GOP and the Democrat Party; globalist, imperialistic, war mongering, surrendering America&rsquo;s sovereignty, etc.  They tried sneaking the Bill Kristol neo-con trained mole, Alan Keyes in - and thankfully, failed in this attempt and Chuck Baldwin got the CP Presidential nomination in 2008.  They are obviously working on this takeover move once again, and this time Tom Tancredo appears to be their designated mole.   </p>
<p>Beware of this guy.    </p>

		<p>I agree with #1, Tancredo is not a traditional conservative, nor is he a race realist.  I don&rsquo;t live in Colorado, so I can&rsquo;t comment on the other candidates.  But he may be the best of those now running.  Choose carefully.</p>

		<p>If he enters the race, Tancredo with throw the election to Hickenlooper. He&rsquo;s too stupid to realize this.</p>
<p>The Republicans never learn. In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt split the Republicans with his Bull Moose Party garbage, handing the election to Woodrow Wilson. In 1976, the animosity between Reagan and Ford contributed to Jimmy Carter being elected.</p>
<p>Tancredo was strident in his attacks against Islam, a few years ago, which I found refreshing. However, to see him cave on the matter of Hispanic immigration is sickening.</p>

		<p>I second Luke&rsquo;s post.  When Tancredo first burst onto the scene previous to this last election, I thought he might be the answer.  He certainly was brave enough to address some issues that others were afraid to touch.</p>
<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve learned more about him and he has fallen out of favor with me.  Frankly, I don&rsquo;t trust the guy.  And the fact that he may be a mole is a definite possibility.</p>
<p>Someone correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but isn&rsquo;t Colorado quite a liberal state?  Diversity and all that?  Never been there so I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We need someone who is not afraid to address the race issue in this country, which of course is tied up with the immigration fiasco.  Until such a person appears, I will simply sit back for the time being and watch the show.</p>

		<p>You have to give Tom a break. Politically only so much is acceptable to be publically stated. He is solidly on the fight against illegal and reducing legal immigration. I wouldn&rsquo;t place too much stock on a general quote. His actions place him as one of our strongest supporters.</p>

		<p>I live in Colorado Springs, and he&rsquo;s got my vote.  If he&rsquo;s a race-realist, should we not also assume that he knows what he can say that will or will not get him demonized?</p>
<p>Forever unelectable myself, I think Tom is a good man.</p>

		<p>I agree with 5 &amp; 6. Unfortunately, for the time being there are certain things that just can&rsquo;t be said in the New America. Give it time. Some day, politicians can be real conservatives again, but not now, not yet. These things take time. Personally, I think that once things get rolling over across the Atlamtic, that will pave the way fro a political and cultural revolution here in America.</p>
<p>But for now, let&rsquo;s choose our politicians based on policies. And this Tancredo guy sounds like the lesser of three evils to me.</p>
