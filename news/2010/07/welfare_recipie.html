<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>California welfare recipients have been able to get taxpayer cash   &mdash;   meant to feed and clothe their children   &mdash;   from ATMs at strip clubs across the state, including some well-known gentlemen&rsquo;s cabarets in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>More than $12,000 from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program was dispensed between the start of 2007 and the end of 2009 at clubs, {snip}.</p>

		<p>I work in my local grocery store as a weekend job while at high school.  One thing I have noticed is the misuse of welfare.  People who pay with EBT generally get to eat better than many of the hard working laborers I see come in.  It&rsquo;s very rare that someone paying with EBT does not leave with a lump of crab legs or a hefty steak.  They also get name brand groceries.  </p>

		<p>The recipients of TANF cash are overwhelmingly female heads of household. Just a thought, a lot of these withdrawals could be by females working in these clubs, working for cash and off the books. The ATMs might just be handy and safe for them to use while there. A large percentage of welfare clients have sideline cash jobs, hustles and other sources of income. There&rsquo;s  a huge underground economy out there. Likewise, Food Stamps are often bartered at a discount for cash or other goods in collusion with small grocery store owners who register fake sales of food to cover themselves. The owners are usually middle easterners with stores in inner city areas who are familiar with the clientele, thus lessening exposure and risk.     </p>

		<p>Just a few years ago, I took a part time job as a cashier while I was in school. To cure the boredom, I used to try to predict whether some one was on ebt or not. I would say my accuracy was at about 90%. One particular case was really sad, a 10 year old girl who came in to the store almost every day. After about six months I finally met the mother. She came in and bought three bottles of wine and a carton of cigarettes on her ebt cash account. Assuming she was on foot, I put it all in one plastic bag. When she asked me to at least double bag it for her I answered no.</p>

<p>Middle Eastern communities are experts at passing information between themselves to avoid taxation, to avoid paying retail prices for goods and services, and how to launder money that&rsquo;s &#8216;off the books&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Recently there have been many instances reported in Canada where middle eastern store owners had figured out how to steal from the lottery tickets winnings.</p>
<p>Coming from lands where corruption and bribery are the norm, their lack of scruples in business is to them quite normal. </p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;The recipients of TANF cash are overwhelmingly female heads of household. Just a thought, a lot of these withdrawals could be by females working in these clubs, working for cash and off the books&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the men using the cards.  They (in the roll of current boyfriend) either &#8216;steal&rsquo; it, demand it from the &#8216;female head of household&rsquo; or she looks the other way while they &#8216;borrow&rsquo; it. </p>
<p>These female heads of household will do anything to keep a man around, no matter what kind of loser he is  &mdash;   men accused of child abuse, men between prison stays, men who steal their EBT cards.  They&rsquo;ll do anything to keep these jerks around even allowing them to abuse their young children while looking the other way.</p>
<p>Many students complain at school about how their mother&rsquo;s latest boyfriend took off with The Card the minute it was reloaded  &mdash;  and they&rsquo;re all acutely aware of that date  &mdash;   and brought it back empty, and they&rsquo;re wondering how they&rsquo;re going to make it through the rest of the month. </p>
<p>The welfare mother rarely kicks these guys out and if she does, there&rsquo;s always another one standing right by to move in  &mdash;  he gets a place to live in the projects, he knows the EBT card is there for easy cash for booze, drugs and strip joints and he gets to kick back until he&rsquo;s (maybe) kicked out again, then he&rsquo;ll pick up with another &#8216;female head of household.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Repeat ad infinitum. <br>

<p>Or, as I noted a few weeks ago, leaning on the mothers to throw teenage sons out of the house.  And worse than that, killing or almost killing the woman&rsquo;s infant children by other men.  It&rsquo;s the whole new male lion taking over a pride phenomenon   &mdash;   drive out the adolescent males, and kill the females&rsquo; young cubs sired by the previous pride master.</p>

<p>QD:</p>
<p>DH (administrator) worked in  a very nasty ghetto high school a number of years ago, in a position where he had to daily deal with &#8216;mothers&rsquo; directly out of the projects.</p>
<p>As per school/federal/state mandates the first line of defense is always to &#8216;talk to the parents&rsquo;  &mdash;  in these cases a single mother, usually in a ratty bathroom and slippers (told to put her cigarette out), often smelling of alcohol and/or marijuana.</p>
<p>When told about her miscreant child&rsquo;s behavior or school failure or excessive absences, the answer often was &#8216;he/she almost 18 (or 17 or 16) and about to get put out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;d do it.</p>
<p>I remember some of these kids telling me that they liked juvenile &#8216;camp.&rsquo; Sure, because they weren&rsquo;t being shot at, had a safe place to sleep, had food to eat and (believe it or not) liked the strict discipline  &mdash;  something sorely missing in their lives.</p>
<p>By 18 (or 17 or 16 or even younger) many of these males have already started their own brood, often having two or three kids by as many women, repeating and expanding the process over and over as I mentioned above.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d brag about it at school, I heard it all the time.</p>
<p>The only solution is to make an IUD or Norplant or tubal ligation a mandatory part of any female accepting any form of government assistance, as Jared Taylor mentions in &#8216;Paved..&rsquo;</p>
<p>The taxes we Whites are paying for this growing underclass are crushing us  &mdash;  and in this upside down world, it is we Whites who cannot afford to have children while welfare mothers have child after child with impunity to further burden the system.</p>
<p>The left&rsquo;s solution?  Grant amnistia to 25 (or more) million unskilled, uneducated, high-fertility welfare parasites to FURTHER overload the welfare system, in a time of high unemployment, while the government figures out how to squeeze more taxes and wealth out of White families.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced the government has implemented the Cloward-Piven strategy.</p>
<p>Hope you&rsquo;ve hidden your gold well, and have enough ammunition (which is scarce here in California), you&rsquo;re going to need it.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
