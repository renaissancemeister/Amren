			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Hohler, Boston Globe, July 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Every night at bedtime, former Celtic Ray Williams locks the doors of his home: a broken-down 1992 Buick, rusting on a back street where he ran out of everything.</p>
<p>The 10-year NBA veteran formerly known as &#8220;Sugar Ray&#8221; leans back in the driver&rsquo;s seat, drapes his legs over the center console, and rests his head on a pillow of tattered towels. He tunes his boom box to gospel music, closes his eyes, and wonders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In recent weeks, he has lived on bread and water.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A former top-10 NBA draft pick who once scored 52 points in a game, Williams is a face of big-time basketball&rsquo;s underclass. As the NBA employs players whose average annual salaries top $5 million, Williams is among scores of retired players for whom the good life vanished not long after the final whistle.</p>
<p>Dozens of NBA retirees, including Williams and his brother, Gus, a two-time All-Star, have sought bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Williams, 55 and diabetic, wants the titans of today&rsquo;s NBA to help take care of him and other retirees who have plenty of time to watch games but no televisions to do so. He needs food, shelter, cash for car repairs, and a job, and he believes the multibillion-dollar league and its players should treat him as if he were a teammate in distress.</p>
<p>One thing Williams especially wants them to know: Unlike many troubled ex-players, he has never fallen prey to drugs, alcohol, or gambling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Williams, the NBA-related organizations best suited to help him have closed their checkbooks to him. The NBA Legends Foundation, which awarded him grants totaling more than $10,000 in 1996 and 2004, denied his recent request for help. So did the NBA Retired Players Association, which in the past year gave him two grants totaling $2,000.</p>
<p>Charles D. Smith, an NBA veteran who heads the retired players association, said Williams has not taken advantage of efforts to help him find work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Problems in transition</b></p>
<p>Hall of Famer Bob Cousy, who helped create the Legends Foundation and serves as a director, understands the financial pressures squeezing many NBA retirees. Cousy himself auctioned his NBA memorabilia in 2003 to help support his daughters and grandchildren. As for Williams, Cousy said, the Legends Foundation generally limits former players to two financial grants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The rejections angered Williams. He said he wants to work but needs transportation to reach a workplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m in the middle of an emergency, and they&rsquo;re going to turn their backs on me?&#8221; he said. &#8220;How about all these [NBA] guys with big contracts? Are they going to help?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Williams has needed help since he went from owning fine cars and comfortable homes  &mdash;  one for his mother in his hometown of Mount Vernon, N.Y., another for his family in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.  &mdash;  to seeking bankruptcy protection in 1994. No longer able to sustain his NBA lifestyle, he worked for a couple of years as a substitute teacher. He also delivered mail and tended bar, but he had trouble holding the jobs partly because he had spent his life training for little else but playing basketball.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [Williams] appeared in every playoff game that year for the Celtics, averaging 6.3 points and 3.2 assists, until he was ejected in Game 4 of the Finals for scuffling with LA&rsquo;s Kurt Rambis. Williams did not play again (coach&rsquo;s decision) as the Lakers went on to win the series in six games.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two years later, Williams was out of the NBA and hurtling toward financial ruin. By 1994, he was in a New Jersey bankruptcy court, having lost his home, his marriage, and nearly his life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so stressed out that I thought about suicide,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Instead, he set out for Florida. Trying to start over, Williams secured a grant from the Legends Foundation. But he lost the money, court records indicate, when the widow of a condominium owner who agreed to a lease-to-own contract with Williams opted out of the contract after the owner died.</p>
<p>Broke again, Williams repeatedly tried in vain to hold jobs. Hindered by his diabetes, which was diagnosed three years ago, he lost or walked away from jobs as a cleaner, handyman, high school girls&rsquo; basketball coach, bakery worker, and golf course groundskeeper. In 2005, he filed again for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Transient since then, Williams has bounced from one friend&rsquo;s house to another&rsquo;s, from one shelter to another. He finally ran out of friends to stay with, soured on the shelter life, and settled a couple of months ago in his car. He also owns a &rsquo;97 Chevy Tahoe but needs to pay a repair shop $550 to release it.</p>
<p>He has no health insurance or car insurance. And he already has tapped his NBA pension, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An avid fisherman, he has sold or pawned his best rods and reels. His golf clubs are for sale. But most of the rest of his belongings were auctioned off after he fell behind on a storage bill.</p>
<p>Williams also is running out of friends and relatives to ask for help. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nor can he turn to his former agent, Fred Slaughter, who once loaned him money.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ray was always a good person, a good player, and a good client,&#8221; Slaughter said. &#8220;But was the loan repaid? No. So I just raised my eyebrows and moved on down the road.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As an aside, Bob Cousy is white. </p>
<p>White ex-players who played during a time of relatively meager salaries seem to be big into helping &#8220;bankrupt&#8221; black players that made as much in one year as they did in their whole careers, and even then, I might be generous here.  Cousy shouldn&rsquo;t help this creep out with one more cent   &mdash;   Let some of the overpaid whiners signing max contract this free agent season help him out.  It&rsquo;ll be a form of remuneration that today&rsquo;s players are getting for essentially stealing money.</p>

<p>So much for &#8220;black role models.&#8221;  Obsess over basketball, get no useful job training, blow your earnings on bling, then spend the rest of your life with your hand out, expecting someone else to support you.  Boo hoo hoo.  I wonder if they still teach the fable of the Grasshopper and the Ant in today&rsquo;s schools.</p>
<p>Exactly what is supposed to make this sordid failure newsworthy?</p>

<p>According to the article, Williams already squandered his entire pension.</p>
<p>Note how the author of this &#8220;whine piece&#8221; tries to blame diabetes for Williams&rsquo; inability to hold a job. Curious how millions of whites manage to live productive lives despite diabetes. Ron Santo had a long and successful baseball career with the Cubs while diabetic; he kept a candy bar handy during games in case his blood sugar went too low. Actress Mary Tyler Moore is another long-term diabetic.</p>
<p>As for Williams&rsquo; former agent, he should have learned long ago that in &#8220;Afrospeak,&#8221; the word &#8220;loan&#8221; translates to standard English as &#8220;gift.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>He needs food, shelter, cash for car repairs, and a job&#8221;</i>.</p>
<p><br>
Mostly a job. Yup, more than anything else, what this man needs is a job. ANY job. Just get a job and you won&rsquo;t have to suffer the indignities of living in your car, begging for handouts, or being interviewed by the Boston Globe. That word again, Mr. Williams: J-O-B. </p>
<p><br>
<i>He also delivered mail and tended bar, but he had trouble holding the jobs partly because he had spent his life training for little else but playing basketball.</i></p>
<p><br>
He&rsquo;s tended bar before? Good, then he can tend bar again. He&rsquo;s delivered mail before? Well as long he wasn&rsquo;t caught stealing he should be able to apply to the Post Office again. Heck, the PO will hire anybody; they&rsquo;re world-famous for taking chances on nonwhite losers like this. </p>

<p>What a load of nonsense. More lame excuses. With no disrespect to mail carriers or bartenders but the article implies that Ray was so stupid he was unable to even train for work with the postal service or behind a counter mixing drinks. </p>
<p>He did &#8220;attend&#8221; the University of Minnesota. Let&rsquo;s not forget about that free ride for however long he stayed. I guess he couldn&rsquo;t relate to the white, racist professor in Econ 101. </p>
<p>Poor Ray is sadly a microcosm of black failure. He may have been good at playing with a round ball but beyond that it all fell apart. White people cannot even comprehend how someone can make millions of dollars per year and end up living in a car.</p>
<p>Worse, there are many black ex-NBA players like him. On the one hand, they do quickly recycle their riches back into the white community purchasing all sorts of goods and services (bling, legal fees&hellip;) but how can this go on year after year after year? </p>
<p>The most telling part of the microcosm aspect is that 1) Ray is blaming others for his failure and 2) he almost demands to be taken care of - as if it&rsquo;s his birthright.</p>
<p>No way, Ray.</p>

		<p>This story reminds me of one I read years ago about Leon Spinks, the mediocre black boxer who was showered with a $6 million dollar paycheck for agreeing to participate in one of Cassius Clay&rsquo;s clownish fights, late in his career when he was lining up stooges and comedy acts, just so he could have an excuse to demand another $20-30 million dollar payday from the media morons who were too stupid to realize they were being hustled by an aging boxer who was 10 years over the hill.</p>
<p>Spinks was found by some sports reporter, a few short years later, tending bar in Chicago and he had blown his entire fortune.  </p>

<p>And, Kudos to the Boston Globe for printing this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Charles D. Smith, an NBA veteran who heads the retired players association, said Williams has not taken advantage of efforts to help him find work&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s worked how many jobs?  And been a failure at every single one of them?</p>
<p>The article stated he&rsquo;s worked as a substitute teacher, delivered mail, tended bar, he was a cleaner, handyman, high school girls&rsquo; basketball coach, bakery worker, and golf course groundskeeper, but failed at each one &#8220;because he had spent his life training for little else but playing basketball.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, Cry Me A River!</p>
<p>All of his self-created problems are someone else&rsquo;s fault, someone else&rsquo;s responsibility.  &#8220;I&rsquo;m in the middle of an emergency, and they&rsquo;re going to turn their backs on me?&#8221;  </p>
<p>He is not capable of self-reflection, of asking himself &#8216;Where did I go wrong?&rsquo; or &#8216;How can I help myself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I write this with full understanding that self-reflection, determination, learning from one&rsquo;s mistakes, taking full responsibility for one&rsquo;s life, and especially not blaming others for one&rsquo;s self-created problems are not black traits  &mdash;  Whites who didn&rsquo;t have these traits didn&rsquo;t survive the last Ice Age.</p>
<p>Williams has been given chance after chance to improve his life and he&rsquo;s rejected every one, tapped out/burned his relatives and friends AND the NBA and, burned his former manager, a car repair shop and a storage facility.</p>
<p>Yeah, Cry Me A River.</p>

<p>I visited the main library in Downtown Chicago yesterday because I am presently unemployed but mainly find work as a contractor (IT-related).  I often check out books of a technical nature to update my skills etc.  </p>
<p>Anyway, when I arrived at the service counter I was greeted by a heavy-set, probably mid-20s black woman who wined no less than 3 times about not wanting to be at work this early (about 9:30am).  This was in front of: me, a few other people in line, and her co-worker (also black) who was seated in the station next to her and presumably who the comments were most directed at.  </p>
<p>I mention this because no matter how many jobs are given to blacks, the work ethic is the same.  Moreover, the lack of motivation becomes exponential when there are several blacks working in an establishment together.</p>
<p>What angers me is that there are plenty of skilled and willing workers who are denied access to these jobs because of Affirmative Action.  And as far as Mr. Ex-Pro Bigshot-Basketball Player is concerned, he has NO EXCUSE.  </p>
<p>He has all the tools available to him to better his situation but he just plain doesn&rsquo;t want to work to better his situation; instead, he looks for more handouts which as more and more people are realizing is the norm for these people.  </p>
<p>NO SYMPATHY.  Let&rsquo;s move on!!!</p>

		<p>Call it the Black Athlete&rsquo;s Burden of a socialized guilt for the lifestyle they set themselves up to endure, but I see in Mr. Williams less the stereotype for the lazy black man than I do the combination of two critical generic personality conditions:</p>
<p>1.  Middle Aged Slump.<br>
If he was in a tribal environment, by virtue of his past achievements and living age, he would be considered a kind of symbolic wealth and pretty much set for life just on the basis of &#8216;been there, done that, let me tell you a story&rsquo; empirical wisdom.  In white Americans this would be the equivalent of a blue collar worker thinking he has made his mark in a company and now can settle down without worrying about further advancement because he&rsquo;s worn out his mind and bodies initial, limited, flexibility getting there.  Then the plant downsizes and we all know where it goes from there.</p>
<p>2.  Hero Crisis.<br>
He is a legend in his own mind.  Legends in the old days got a good death because someone wanted the title of best or at least killer of the best.  That hasn&rsquo;t happened and so the man lives after his best years are done and wonders why nobody cares that he was once someone.  That kind of will-to-achievement ego is what you NEED when you are playing at the very edge of your physical abilities in a sport like basketball and things like strategy and conditioned discipline are more a hindrance than a help.  But it is also the road to ruin once you are out of the specialization zone you were made to be good at.</p>
<p>In this, I think AmRen missed the best two quotes that can be applied here-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
But Frazier&rsquo;s legacy was never in jeopardy. Though Williams enjoyed a long run in the league, he gained a reputation as a player sometimes more suited for street ball than structured NBA schemes. An explosive scorer, Williams also sparkled at times as a defender and playmaker. But he often lacked court discipline, which translated into turnovers (he led the league with 335 in the 1982-83 season), questionable shot selection, and headaches for his bosses.</p>
<p>When the Celtics signed Williams in February 1985 to back up guards Dennis Johnson and Danny Ainge, Knicks general manager Dave DeBusschere was quoted as saying, &ldquo;Ray Williams will help Boston as long as they keep the ball out of his hands at the end of games. Otherwise, he&rsquo;ll try taking the last shot instead of Larry Bird, and [Celtics president] Red [Auerbach] will be out there with a gun.&rsquo;&rsquo;<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Hyper individualist with poor &#8216;team player&rsquo; (social conformity) issues already imbedded when he was young.  Not uncommon among blacks whose early physical maturation and heavy muscle density (i.e. ideal profession sports candidacy) essentially comes with a MASSIVE testosterone penalty which often expresses itself as &#8216;high self esteem&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
&ldquo;Ray was always a good person, a good player, and a good client,&rsquo;&rsquo; Slaughter said. &ldquo;But was the loan repaid? No. So I just raised my eyebrows and moved on down the road.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Williams has never been arrested. But the deeper he falls into despair, he said, the more he prays not to break the law to make ends meet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t have faith, I probably would have done something drastic by now, something I would regret for a long time,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &ldquo;I know what the devil wants me to do, to turn to crime or drugs, or anything to destroy my faith.&rsquo;&rsquo;<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Suicide ideation and building criminal pathology due to desperation.  He tries to compensate for his low intelligence by clinging to group moral identity by religious association, either for rectitudinal recognition.  Or for the simple belief that compassion is the same as pity.</p>
<p>Either way, he is genuinely too old to gain much SS compensation from work before retirement in the next 10-12 years and it would be foolish to not consider the difference between a 30-40,000 dollar a year &#8216;most famous basketball player in prison&rsquo; payout.  </p>
<p>And maybe providing half that as a permanent benefit issuance through an externally controlled lifestyle.</p>
<p>I find the latter pathetic but I do admit to a personal bias.</p>
<p>My uncle worked 20 years with the Topeka, KS department of sanitation, retired with bad knees and ankles and still came up to Colorado to do part time work as a Pizza Delivery guy.  With all this, he was never well paid or wise with money and so he had to have an endowment set up by my grandmother (of all her four sons) to make sure he has a life-out assurance.  The family helps keep him straight and narrowed with financial matters and he has a girlfriend that also is a good influence in his life as he lives in a retirement complex near all of us.</p>
<p>I would say he has a roughly $15,000.00 a year income which is not the greatest but it doesn&rsquo;t phase him.</p>
<p>He may not be the most successful of our kin but I would be very upset if I found out he had been discovered dead in some broken down car due to exposure or treatable complications from a known chronic disease.</p>
<p>What Mr. Williams case may come down to is someone making a similar predictive judgment and deciding that since William&rsquo;s is not going to change it&rsquo;s time to bypass all the prevarication about &#8216;wanting to be a good retired NBA member&rsquo; as pride posturing on his part.</p>
<p>Once you do that, you can sit the guy down, have an honest discussion, get him to sign over his cars and other (dangerous) &#8216;excess capital&rsquo; rights as an understanding of what he is giving up.</p>
<p>And then have say 4 players get together with a similar cash annuity system of half a million dollars that automatically covers rent and utilities in a cheap place along with a grocery stipend of no more than 500 dollars a month.  Say 1,500 total.  For the rest of his life.  The residual to be returned to them upon his death or incarceration.</p>
<p>This would get him off the streets and make sure that -if he does- shift to criminality, through isolation, boredom or whatever, he has minimal resources to do so.  While the black athletes who tried can at least say they learned a lesson in life responsibilities by providing for someone of their own race who clearly no longer can.</p>
<p>Does this set a bad example?  Maybe.  But it makes good economic sense.  And it may well be a future we need to be aware of the potential of when 90% of our uneducated poor end up in similar circumstances and need a similar protective custodial overwatch.  Starting at 20.  As the minimum IQ and education level for social success just keeps moving evermore rightwards (130 IQ, 6-8 years, not including post graduate degrees&hellip;), it may not even be a racial issue anymore.</p>
<p>If you want to rebuild the sellable housing market, start counting the poor.</p>

<p>Mr. Ray Williams has it backward. Getting a job comes first, and the other things come later. If. Mr. Williams wants food, shelter, and cash for car repairs, he needs to get a job first, so that he can earn money for those things.</p>
<p>I often make critical comments about whites on this website, but I have to admit that whites can sometimes be soft, tender-hearted, and sentimental people. I am trying to imagine how people in India or China would react to Mr. Williams&rsquo; plight. They would probably laugh in his face, and consider him the biggest fool they have ever heard of. Asians are known to be penny-pinchers. They are very frugal in their spending, because they are always thinking about the future, and about the welfare of their children and grandchildren. People who work in America as janitors and dishwashers, make more money than school teachers in India and China. In America, there is no excuse for failing to pay your bills, unless you have been paralysed by a stroke or immobilized by cancer. I have never understood how America supports able-bodied people with public funds, when those people refuse to work. Mr. Williams suffers from the disease of laziness. It is not fashionable in the America of today, to describe people as being lazy. </p>
<p>I hold a very stressful job in the engineering field, and I suffer constantly from ulcers and migraines. Every single day, I feel like quitting my job because of the long hours and the stress. Perhaps I should follow Mr. Williams&rsquo; example and quit my job, in the hope that my white friends who post regularly here at American Renaissance, will send checks support me. We have many black, hispanic, and Native American welfare queens. But Indians are under-represented in the welfare queen category, and I would like to volunteer to get on the welfare gravy train.</p>
<p>Seriously, the problem Mr. Williams is facing is that he has not hit rock bottom. When he finds himself starving, and there is nobody left to give him a hand-out, he will be forced to work. Hunger pangs can be very painful. Most of us have to drag ourselves out of bed in the morning, in order to go to work, even when we do not feel like doing so. If nobody bails him out, Mr. Williams may find himself in the same situation, as the rest of us. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re certainly right that the poor are rich here in America.  Even welfare recipients have flat screen televisions, private apartments and bathrooms, cars, laptop computers, food stamps etc. The poor in many counties live on the streets and are very close to starvation. It is difficult to feel sorry for NBA players who made millions only to squander the money on high living. Most of these destitute formerly rich athletes are black. It sounds like Mr. Williams had plenty of jobs but couldn&rsquo;t hold on to them for unknown personal reasons.    </p>
