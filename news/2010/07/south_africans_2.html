<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The roadside flag sellers saw it coming first.</p>
<p>When South Africa&rsquo;s heady swell of World Cup unity and patriotism suddenly ebbed, they sensed it. With the elimination of the national soccer team from the tournament last month, the flags for sale at traffic lights were gone.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For a few glorious months, the flags had sold themselves, a hopeful suggestion that this nation  &mdash;  often divided between rich and poor, black and white  &mdash;  was coming together. It was the moment, as retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu of Cape Town put it at the World Cup kickoff concert, that South Africa had transmuted from an ugly caterpillar into a beautiful butterfly.</p>
<p>It was a moment, say some analysts, that was not likely to last.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Economic statistics, however are not encouraging. Despite the economic boost from the building of infrastructure ahead of the World Cup, 171,000 jobs were lost nationwide in the first quarter of the year.</p>
<p>The World Cup is projected to just break even, according to Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, with the benefits to the economy about equal to outlays by the government.</p>
<p>Gumede, the analyst, said President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s ruling African National Congress, brawling over the leadership succession, lacks the will to turn an optimistic moment into something more powerful and lasting.</p>
<p>The health and education systems are deeply troubled. Poverty and social inequity remain intractable. The annual strike season, when public and private sector unions negotiate wages with government and business, will resume later this month. Protests over the poor delivery of public services may also grow vehement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The legacy of the World Cup will be people demanding and expecting things to happen, because we have spent all this money on all these things for the World Cup,&#8221; said Gumede. &#8220;Wage demands are going to be a lot more strident. Ordinary communities are going to say if you can build all these stadiums, you cannot say there&rsquo;s not money to deliver to us. The unemployed are going to say the same thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereby subtly implanting in the reader&rsquo;s mind the notion that &#8220;White = rich; black = poor.&#8221;  Excellent work, Comrade Dixon!</p>
<p>This peculiar governmedia fantasy that South Africa was somehow going to reveal itself as the glorious Land of Shamballa just because a soccer tournament was being held there baffles me.  It makes no sense at all.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the black mindset for you.  The witch doctors have performed the correct rituals; now let the manna fall from heaven.</p>
<p>Here or in amerika, the pattern&rsquo;s the same.  And when it doesn&rsquo;t work, Whitey is always to blame.<br/>

		<p>South Africa is in essence not markedly different than any other area of sub-Saharan Africa. As  European influence wanes, they all have rapidly reverted to tribal barbarism. Nothing unexpected here. Any disillusioned idealists should look up Albert Schweitzer or David Livingstone&rsquo;s views on the potential of these people.<br/>
Could on China to take full advantage of the situation.</p>

The one word that pops into my mind when I read these articles is desperation.</p>
<p>I believe these people are truly desperate to believe that a multi-racial, multi-cultural utopia is possible if only we try harder.</p>
<p>They want to believe but all they have is their belief. Reality keeps smacking them in the face and they can&rsquo;t understand why.</p>

		<p>Actually, it was the citizens of Orania, who correctly predicted that nothing would change in South Africa, despite all the World Cup hoopla. They are more concerned with building their town, than worrying about the South African soccer team.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why that sportswriter couldn&rsquo;t figure out why the Afrikaaners of Oriana didn&rsquo;t &#8220;share&#8221; their hotel and hospital and all the other things they have built, with the likes of Soweto. </p>

		<p>Anonymous 3,</p>
<p>If  you  tabulate the  numbers  slaughtered  in the  last 200  years  continent  by  continent  you  will  see  that  Europe tops  the  internecine killing  list.  So  your  point  about  Africa is  just  the  usual  wishful  and  fantastic  thinking.</p>
<p>How  about  the  kill  list  for  WWI and  WW2.  And the  kill  list  in  Russia  after  the  1917  Revolution.  And the innumerable  wars  fought  in  Europe  during  the  19th  century and  before.</p>

<p>How about we only look at last 50 years and think of the 5m people deda just in the Second Congo War mere 10 years ago. Or the Rwanda genocide, Idi Amin, the Derg in Ethiopia, or&hellip;note that this list is post-Liberation. The relative calm in Africa in 19th and 1st half of 20th century was the blessing of colonisation.</p>
<p>Before the European&rsquo;s came to stay (i.e. lets look at 1,000 years rather than 200 years) Africa was the most violent place on the planet. As one example, the Zulu&rsquo;s wiped out number of tribes in their movement South (please note that Zulus actually came to South Africa after the Dutch settlers and only lived on the tropical east coast). Also, lets not forget that competing tribes were the main driver of slavery. First the customers were Arabs, then Europeans&hellip;the supply was always from Africans themselves.</p>

		<p>OCCAM - the numbers you claim making Europe top the list of &#8220;internecine&#8221; warfare result because (1) blacks don&rsquo;t keep such numbers about themselves in Africa and (2)nobody else much cares about what goes on in Africa other than it is a huge financial drain on developed countries.  We in America have enough problems concerning ourselves with the &#8220;little Africa&#8221; or &#8220;little latin america&#8221; right here in our own country dragging us down into the pit.  I need to ask though, OCCAM, are you one of those apologists for black behavior?  WWI and WWII were truly horrible in numbers of dead, but the coming race war and overt campaign to wipe out the white race is going to be much, much, much worse because it will happen HERE, not &#8220;over there&#8221;.</p>

		<p>7 OCCAM whats your point?  Since the end of &#8220;colonialism&#8221; (white influence) in Africa blacks have been doing an impressive job of killing each other.  If they had the abilities of WW2 Europe the numbers might have been the same, who knows?</p>
<p>Are you also counting crime (favorite black past time in SA) with more than 300 000 since end of Apartheid? And the reports are that the conviction rate is a little below 2% (yes less than 1 in 50) for those. That figure excludes culpable homicide where the figure suspiciously grows every year as the murder rate comes down.</p>

<p>There is no comparison here.  This can be explained away solely by extreme differences in technological advancement.</p>
<p>When Napoleon was campaigning in Europe with the most advanced firearms of the age, African tribesmen were warring with spears.</p>
<p>Europeans simply hit each other with a bigger stick.  Give the Hutus and Tutsis tanks, chemical weapons, artillery, and strategic bombers and see what happens. </p>

<p>I can tell you now what will happen.  They will break them and be reduced to AK47&rsquo;s, machetes and spears within 3 months.</p>
<p>Ever wonder why the only technology that survives in Africa is the AK47 and the Toyota Hilux?  It is because those are the two western-designed devices that are almost indestructible. See Jeremy Clarkson&rsquo;s video on the indestructible Toyota Hilux.</p>
<p>South Africa produced the G6 self-propelled gun and an armoured personnel carrier known as the &#8220;Ratel&#8221; (Badger). To my knowledge there are three working examples left of the G5-G6 guns (outside of military museums) and three Ratels.  All the rest are broken or unserviceable.</p>

<p>And  theres  is  the  usual  propaganistic  point  about  Hutus  and  Tutsis.  Well,  compare  the  populations  of  Rwanda and  Burundi  before the  1994  Rwanda  civil war,  they  are  almost  the same  with  approximately  the same  percentage  of  Tutsis  for  both  countries.  Now, 15 years  after the  war  the  comparative  populations are  just  as they  were  before 1994.  So where  is  the genocide  the  West  loves to  chatter  on about?</p>
<p>The supposed  3-5(that&rsquo;s how  innumerate Western  journalists  are) million  killed in  the  Congo is  just  mainly  hype  created  by  &#8220;fly-in,  fly-out  Western  reporters&#8221;.  If  such  numbers  were  indeed  correct  then  how  come  Congo&rsquo;s  population  has  been  increasing  steadily  from  70-75 million  in the  last 10  years.</p>

		<p>OCCAM, I think that the growth in population despite the high casualties in African wars is a function of the 6 - 8 children that are still the norm per family in sub-Saharan Africa. Without wars the growth rate would be even higher. In Apartheid South Africa (i.e. when there was still decent healthcare and security for all South Africans) the black population grew from 5m in 1940s to 40m by 1990.  </p>

<p>2 points:</p>
<p>In western civilizations, when the fighting ends, civilizations advance. When blacks fight, they succumb to savagery and never recover.</p>
<p>If white civilizations are as bad as you claim, why it it the highest goal of blacks to live in white nations and white neighborhoods?</p>
<p>I know how violent and dangerous blacks are so I do everything I can to avoid being around blacks. Blacks claim whites are evil and yet do everything in their power to live with white people.</p>
<p>Either blacks are lying about how evil they believe whites to be or they&rsquo;re not intelligent enough to avoid the people they see as evil.</p>
<p>Which is it?</p>

		<p>To OCCAM, Yes the loss of life in WW1 was insane, the loss of life in WW2 was horrendous, but evil had to be stopped. The American Civil war was tragic and both the Viet-Nam and the Trojans wars were both pretty pointless, BUT at least all these wars came to an end and all sides now talk to each other and the wars were fought in uniform.</p>
<p>2, Remember Rhodesia? Look at South Africa, when, the pot of gold is empty and the white industrial/commercial tax base disappears what will be left apart from another failed African state. Is this the way America will go after another 2 generations of uncontrolled 3rd world immigration and explosive Afro/American home grown population increase???</p>
<p>3,Re South African Friends and relatives, they all miss their beautiful and once prosperous homeland. No way would they go back, no future for their children, crime and run-down infrastructure. My own SA family connections are now in Las Vegas, moved there after Sowerto. In those days America welcomed them as white professional people.</p>

		<p>Well OCCAM the reason no one disputed your point about numbers killed in 20th century European wars vs. these African wars is because you&rsquo;re right. Yeah, way more people died in WW1 and WW2 than were dying/ are dying in African wars. 10s of millions of Russians and tens of millions of Germans died in WW2 alone. And since I&rsquo;m sure everyone here already knew this, I don&rsquo;t really know why you would bring it up and then demand that we refute it.</p>

		<p>OCCAM- you missed the point of what we were saying. There&rsquo;s no ethical difference in Western and African people with genocidal intentions- the Westerners just had much better results due to superior organization, technology and intellect. Counting up bodies amounts to very little ethically. </p>
<p>The main difference is the West learns from its mistakes, Africa makes it over and over and over again.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a little something for Occam and the others who find thinking a difficult and dangerous chore.</p>
<p>This is a fragment unashamedly stolen from Francis W. Porretto&rsquo;s blog, </p>
<p><a href="http://www.eternityroad.info/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.eternityroad.info/index.php</a></p>
<p>and is a partial reprint of an article published by an ex-aid worker (Kevin Myers) in the BELFAST TELEGRAPH and a link to another in the Belfast Independent.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I went to Ethiopia just over 20 years ago, I saw many things I never reported  &mdash;  such as the menacing effect of gangs of young men with Kalashnikovs everywhere, while women did all the work. In the very middle of starvation and death, men spent their time drinking the local hooch in the boonabate shebeens. </p>
<p>Alongside the boonabates were shanty-brothels, to which drinkers would casually repair, to briefly relieve themselves in the scarred orifice of some wretched prostitute (whom God preserve and protect). </p>
<p>I saw all this and did not report it, nor the anger of the Irish aid workers at the sexual incontinence and fecklessness of Ethiopian men. Why? Because I wanted to write much-acclaimed, tear-jerkingly purple prose about wide-eyed, fly-infested children  &mdash;  not cold, unpopular and even &lsquo;racist&rsquo; accusations about African male culpability. </p>
<p>Am I able to rebut good and honourable people like John O&rsquo;Shea, who are now warning us that once again, we must feed the starving Ethiopian children? </p>
<p>No, of course I&rsquo;m not. But I am lost in awe at the dreadful options open to us. This is the greatest moral quandary facing the world. We cannot allow the starving children of Ethiopia to die. Yet the wide-eyed children of 1984-86, who were saved by western medicines and foodstuffs, helped begin the greatest population explosion in human history, which will bring Ethiopia&rsquo;s population to 170 million by 2050. By that time, Nigeria&rsquo;s population will be 340 million, (up from just 19 million in 1930). The same is true over much of Africa. </p>
<p>Thus we are heading towards a demographic holocaust, with a potential premature loss of life far exceeding that of all the wars of the 20th century. This terrible truth cannot be ignored.&#8221;</p>
