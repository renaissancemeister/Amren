			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>N.C. Aizenman, Washington Post, July 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mention the new &#8220;tan tax&#8221; in a major news outlet and cries of discrimination and reverse racism often follow.</p>
<p>The complaint surfaced on reader comment boards to blogs and news Web sites back in December, when it became clear that the levy  &mdash;  a 10 percent surcharge on the use of ultraviolet tanning beds  &mdash;  was likely to be included in the new health-care overhaul bill. Since then, it&rsquo;s been repeated by conservative commentators such as Rush Limbaugh and Doc Thompson, a fill-in host for Glenn Beck who intoned in March, &#8220;I now know the pain of racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The case can seem deceptively simple: Since patrons of tanning salons are almost exclusively white, the tax will be almost entirely paid by white people and, therefore, violates their constitutional right to equal protection under the law.</p>
<p>But does the argument have any merit? Not remotely said Randall Kennedy, a professor at Harvard Law School specializing in racial conflict and law.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no constitutional problem at all, because a plaintiff would have to show that the government intended to disadvantage a particular group, not simply that the group is disadvantaged in effect,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Kennedy said that this is why courts have upheld a raft of other laws that also happen to have a disproportionate impact on particular groups. For example, laws that impose higher penalties for possession or trafficking of crack cocaine as opposed to powder cocaine resulted in far harsher sentences for African Americans compared to whites. And laws that offer preferential treatment for veterans are much more likely to benefit men than women. But in both cases judges ruled that, because lawmakers did not intend to disadvantage black people or women when drafting those laws, they are legal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the levy&rsquo;s supporters argued from the start that it had a dual purpose: to raise funds to cover some of the cost of extending health coverage to the uninsured and to discourage a habit that scientific studies have linked with increased risk of cancer.</p>
<p>&#8220;To say that this health rationale was a mere pretext for wanting to stick it to white people is completely implausible,&#8221; Kennedy said.<br>

		<p>There is no such thing as &#8220;reverse&#8221; racism.  Racism is racism, period.  To call anti-White discrimination &#8220;reverse&#8221; racism is to subtly imply that only discrimination against non-Whites is <i>real</i> racism.</p>
<p>Which, of course, is precisely what the governmedia want us to believe.<br>

		<p>A good portion of the financial crises is due to disparate impact of having lending rules that treat all borrowers using the same standards.  When blacks don&rsquo;t meet the standards at a higher rate than whites the feds come in and demand lower standards for them.  Then, of course, blacks default and then America defaults.  Well, how many blacks use tanning beds?  Not too many I bet.  Although I would like to see people not use tanning beds since it is so bad for white people&rsquo;s health.  But the 10% tax was a stick it to whitey tax.  Can you imagine a hair straightener tax not being struck down as disparate?</p>
<p>I must object to the military example.  Although I have never been a service member I have the greatest respect for our men and women in uniform.  Any privilege that comes with being a veteran is EARNED and not based on disparate impact of any sort.<br>

		<p>Apply this logic to Arizona SB 1070, and the Feds would have a much weaker case against it.  (As it is, they&rsquo;re not using race in their actual case, only in side briefs for now.  This may change).</p>
<p>Apply this logic to the myriad of lawsuits against big city fire departments every time they want to hire or promote firefighters.  That is a house of cards built entirely on the quick sand of disparate impact.  </p>
<p>If disparate impact isn&rsquo;t a legitimate weapon to use in court, then 3/4 of the Civil Rights industry goes out of business.</p>

		<p>Mr. Kennedy is right! We would have no case for &#8220;racial discrimination.&#8221; The law has pro-health intentions, not &#8220;disparate impact.&#8221; We really do not want to become like the race-obsessed &amp; nonsense-filled Black mobs, do we?</p>
<p>White advocacy should focus on credible concerns (i.e. Race Quotas, Affirmative Action, forced busing, immigration policy, anti-White school curriculm, etc.); and plus this could be an inadvertantly pro-White tax, as it encourages Whites to protect their skin from cancer.</p>

		<p>Well tanning is a retarded thing anyways. You can tell the stupid folk, they are the whites who burn their skin to a dark brown.<br>
Everywhere else in the world people WANT pale skin, and here our sheep poison our skin to make it darker!<br>
Lunacy.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they just, i dunno, spend some more time out in the sun which is actually healthy for you?</p>

		<p>There is no such thing as &#8220;reverse racism&#8221; or &#8220;reverse discrimination.&#8221;  There is only &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>To suggest the former is to suggest that such things as racism and discrimination are the sole province of the white man, and his own invention, which is most assuredly not the case, as anyone from South Africa or The Country Formerly Known as Rhodesia can tell you.</p>
<p>I hear this from white people often and always try to correct it.  Surprisingly I&rsquo;ve found most to be receptive to the idea.  Of course there are always those few&hellip;&hellip;</p>

		<p>I think 4  &mdash;  Hank Hill has it right. There are more important battles to fight. Stick with things where it can clearly be show that it was intended to benefit blacks at the expense of whites, like affirmative action, quotas, etc.</p>

		<p>As far as I am concerned, tanning is a health risk, so it fits in a healthcare bill and is not racist. Some comment on hair relaxer, which is bad for the scalp. You all have a point. But honestly, as much as I loathe Obama and love my people, I really do not think there was intention behind this. Like the others said, let us not become obsessed.</p>
<p>I am however against this on legal grounds. The healthcare bill is unconstitutional and goes against the American ideal of self-reliance. I say self-reliance and not individual freedom because I believe we are all smart enough to know that tanning begets skin cancer and we do not need the government to tell us this. Individual freedom would imply there are plenty of stupid people choosing to take such risks. Perhaps I am too optimistic. </p>
<p>America was founded by a people who were smart enough to make their own decisions. What exactly happened?</p>

This argument of reverse racism, although true, does have holes in it; of course won&rsquo;t be taken seriously in any event, as it&rsquo;s the popular meme to hate and dismiss White people, their rights, and concerns.</p>
<p>A better argument for the use of tanning beds can be found in this video, where it is proposed that getting burned is of course not healthy, and is a result of *both* poor nutrition and over-exposure; whereas in order to avoid burning and possibly getting cancer one must eat the correct foods with the correct amount of nutrients and have the correct amount of exposure to UV rays for the individual person in order to generate Vitamin D in the skin.</p>
<p>https://naturalnews.tv/v.asp?v=234  </p>
<p>But of course everyone is against this common sense approach, and it will never see the light of day in any argument for the cessation of a tax on tanning beds.</p>

		<p>The skin produces Vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, and almost all people in North America are deficient in Vitamin D. The Cleveland Clinic tested a wide range of people for Vitamin D, young, old, all races and every one was low.</p>
<p>At particular risk are blacks, as the higher levels of melanin in their skin filters out much of the sunlight. This may explain the high levels of kidney failure and other diseases in blacks.</p>
<p>It would benefit most people to be exposed to artificial sunlight for a limited time in the winter months.</p>

		<p>I owe all my White Amren Community Members a grave and heartfelt apology.  I have let you down. I have not lived up to the high standards and shared values that we all aspire toward.  My actions have embarrassed not only myself, but also all those who worked so hard to make our community vibrant, strong, and safe.</p>
<p>I failed to wear sunscreen this summer, so now I am darkened into an embarrassing bronze.  My error faces me every time I look in the mirror.  I have darkened what should have been as light and bright as the angel&rsquo;s sun.</p>
<p>I pledge to let my tan fade into obscurity and recover the true uniform of my people- WHITENESS!</p>
<p>Join me-  TRANSCEND DIVERSITY AND WEAR MORE SUNSCREEN!</p>
