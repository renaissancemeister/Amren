<h1>Multicultural Issue on Agenda</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mary B. Pasciak, Buffalo News, July 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The public is invited to a meeting Tuesday that will address concerns regarding the Buffalo Public Schools&rsquo; education of immigrant students who do not speak English as their native language.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Board of Education President Ralph R. Hernandez has been pushing for an advisory board that would report to the Board of Education. Meanwhile, Superintendent James A. Williams is {snip} proposing a 15-member advisory panel, including 10 members who would represent the top languages spoken in the schools.</p>
<p>Four members would represent the Spanish-speaking community. Two would represent the Karen community; two, Somali; and one each, Arabic and Burmese.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to the advisory board, other items on Tuesday&rsquo;s agenda are an overview of the district&rsquo;s multilingual department&rsquo;s programs and the district&rsquo;s policy for students whose native language is not English.<br>

You can see from the article that the school board president is Hispanic (Some background: an audit of his take home computer revealed visits to porn sites and his son was arrest for dealing pot). </p>
<p>The superintendent, no surprise here, is black. The formerly majority black board insists on a black man as a powerful black role model. It hasn&rsquo;t worked. Black failure rate keeps rising and now stands at 53%.</p>

		<p>There was an article in the LA Times (online, of course) just today that reported on how a latina school board member got a new superintendent to fire a white, female principal of a school in favor of a latino principal.  </p>
<p>The super could not give a reason in public why she was fired and the parents came out supporting her.  Their only complaint against her was that she didn&rsquo;t speak spanish, but otherwise they liked her.</p>
<p>Apparently, there were not enough latinos from the local area enrolled in the new multimillion dollar school, through no fault of the principal.  The local neighborhood is almost 100% latino, but only 70% of the students were.</p>
