<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The tensions that sometimes boil over in Milford are simmering in other towns across the state, turning immigration into a key issue in state political races this year.</p>
<p>The Legislature passed a budget with language specifying restrictions on public benefits available to the estimated 150,000 to 250,000 undocumented immigrants in Massachusetts. It was a watered-down version of a tougher amendment passed in the Senate, stirring passionate debate about illegal immigration in an atmosphere made more combustible by a combination of high unemployment, strained-to-the-limit state and local budgets, and election-year politics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For all the complaints today about illegal immigrants in town, Milford, which is located about 16 miles southeast of Worcester, celebrates its rich history as an immigrant gateway. There are monuments paying tribute to the Irish, Italian, and Portuguese immigrants who began arriving here a century or more ago.</p>
<p>In the melting-pot enclave of Prospect Heights, a World War II memorial honors &#8220;those who came to America to find freedom and a better life.&#8221; The monument is adorned with ceramic flags of the nations they came from: Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Armenia, Poland, and Greece.</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;People are resentful at the number of public programs that are used by this population,&#8221; she [Marie Parente, a former Democratic state representative] said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re allowing lawbreakers to access our programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re opposed to illegal immigration  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because it&rsquo;s illegal,&#8221; said John Seaver, a former selectman. {snip}</p>
<p>Undocumented immigrants are not entitled to welfare-type cash assistance or food stamps. Under a US Supreme Court ruling, they may enroll in public schools. And under other court rulings or statutes, if they are poor or meet certain income guidelines, they can receive free treatment in emergency rooms, medical and nutritional aid for low-income children and mothers, and obtain public housing in state-funded developments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Bertorelli, a grandson of Italian and Irish immigrants, said a flood of illegal immigrants several years ago created a &#8220;very dangerous overcrowding&#8221; problem when landlords and sometimes tenants began to turn multifamily homes into lodging houses, illegally creating groups of one-room units in a single apartment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;What we witnessed most of all were unsanitary conditions the tenants were living in,&#8221; said Mazzuchelli [Paul Mazzuchelli, Milford&rsquo;s director of health]. &#8220;Who was the victim? It was the tenant. They were immigrants. They were scared. They weren&rsquo;t going to complain.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Loughlin estimates there are between 2,000 and 2,500 Ecuadorans and more than 1,000 Brazilians still residing in Milford, down from perhaps double that total two years ago. Most are here illegally, the chief said.</p>
<p>State data for 2008-09 show that 17.2 percent of the students in the town&rsquo;s public schools speak a first language other than English, about 12 percent higher than the statewide average. The figure has increased in nine of the last 10 years.</p>
<p>The Ecuadorans are the most visible and isolated of the linguistic minorities in Milford. Many are members of indigenous tribes in Ecuador&rsquo;s rural interior, and some arrived here illiterate, speaking neither English nor Spanish but one of the unwritten Quechuan dialects of South America&rsquo;s Andean region.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last fall, a Milford man, Richard Grossi, died of injuries suffered after his vehicle was hit by a car driven by an unlicensed Portuguese woman who has been in the country illegally for several years. Police said Maria Leite admitted running through a stop sign. On July 1, after a hearing in the Milford court, she was taken into custody by federal immigration officers pending trial on a charge of motor vehicle homicide.</p>
<p>Such cases often spark an outraged and inflammatory response from residents, exacerbating tensions.</p>
<p>While there are outspoken critics of the immigrants in Milford, there are many others trying to help them assimilate.</p>
<p>At St. Mary&rsquo;s, many find help and a haven. Father Manny, as Clavijo [the Rev. Manuel Clavijo, associate pastor of St. Mary of the Assumption Church] is known, oversees a large Hispanic ministry that reaches out to other immigrants, too.</p>
<p>On a weeknight last month in the parish center hall, the 33-year-old native of Colombia participated in a graduation ceremony for dozens of students in a growing English as a second language program.</p>

<p>I detest this sentence by the same ole morons who keep saying this! Oppose illegal aliens because it is illegal to be here? Come on! We all know what they REALLY mean. It is because they are non white! Any White nation that accepts millions upon millions of nonwhites into their midst is legally insane!</p>
<p> But too many are too cowardly to admit the truth. Then when a White person says the truth those same people are the first to yell RACIST! If these were White Euros or South Africans (Boers) that were illegal I would welcome them with open arms.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Among whom?  I see debate in the media.  I sort of see debate among politicians (but what I mostly see is pro-immigrant politician careers ending).  I see &#8220;debate&#8221; from illegals&hellip;.if rioting, racial slurs against whites and criminal behavior can be called debate.</p>
<p>What I do not see, ANYWHERE, is debate among regular people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because there is none.  Among regular people, voters, there is STRONG anti-immigrant consensus.</p>
<p>The debate only exists as ink on this newspaper.</p>

<p>Excellent point! I bristle whenever I hear all this mewling about the legality of the &#8220;immigration&#8221; issue - as if that&rsquo;s what anyone REALLY cares about!! Self-styled &#8220;conservatives&#8221; are very fond of this &#8220;we&rsquo;re a nation of laws&#8221; baloney, as if the breaking of a law is the real problem - like say, shoplifting, jaywalking, or speeding, one wonders?! What rubbish!!</p>
<p>The problem is that America has been overrun by unskilled, uneducated, primitive, non-white, third-world aliens - THAT is the problem, not that they broke a law in getting here!! </p>
<p>Of course, all immigration should be controlled and done in good order, but as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, were these illegals Swedes, Germans, Dutch, Danes, Irish and the like, the possibility that they came to America in &#8220;illegal&#8221; fashion would be the least of my concerns!   <br>

		<p>You can see that many (most?) Hispanics already here and citizens insist the US relinquish sovereignty - something they would never tolerate in their native land. The more we admit, the louder the push to open our southern border. Who needs this? They are not loyal citizens! The Democrats are willing to surrender in exchange for votes. Never vote for a Democrat and the country will benefit.</p>

		<p>Note that many of these people are &#8220;tribal&#8221;, which probably means they are uncivilized according to American standards.  They don&rsquo;t speak English or even Spanish and probably have low IQ&rsquo;s.  How can they participate in MA society?  They drive cars with no understanding of English signs or traffic laws and, in many cases, commit property crimes to get by.  The cars they improperly operate probably are stolen or don&rsquo;t have proper registration or insurance.  On TV, I routinely see traffic stops in which the driver can&rsquo;t even speak enough English to converse with the cops.  Reasonable suspicion of illegal status?  All over the place!</p>

		<p>I have to wonder just how &#8220;Portuguese&#8221; was that unlicensed Portugese driver.  There are many Cape Verdians living there, and they&rsquo;re not white, even if they speak Porguese.</p>

<p>Tha main cause of homelessness.  Ever notice that the homeless are always White and black Americans and never immigrants?</p>
<p>They get virtually all the government housing, illegal or not.</p>

		<p>Tribal Ecuadoreans, I guess they can work on the llama ranches, they are totally unsuited for modern society and belong back in their third world country. </p>
