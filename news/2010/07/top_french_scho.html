<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>France is embarking on a grand experiment  &mdash;  how to diversify the overwhelmingly white &#8220;grandes écoles,&#8221; the elite universities that have produced French leaders in every walk of life  &mdash;  and Rizane el-Yazidi is one of the pioneers.</p>

		<p>The experiment will show the obvious facts about diversity&hellip;standards will be impossible to maintain with a mixed race campus. Something has to give..either standards or the minority students.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Diversity&#8221; = No White People<br>
The mindset of black people has travelled the world and is used by all non-white people to guilt and shame white people into getting their way.  You will see French resources and time going into helping non-white foreigners while French students suffer so non-white grade scores can equal or surpass them.  It&rsquo;s already happened in England.  The government there has taken on an active campaign to disenfranchise the English population so non-white student grade scores surpass English.  A report released a couple years ago showed English test scores remained flat from age 8 to 18 while all non-white scored increased dramatically in the same time period.  Test scores on the English version of the SATs are down from the 1960s.  The whole racial &#8220;equality&#8221; movement is based on disadvantaging white people and advantaging non-white people.</p>

		<p>All they want to accomplish is tokenism. </p>
<p>If they can parade a few black scholars and push them into visibility as politicians or pundits, the sham of multiracialism will be satisfied.</p>

		<p>These &#8220;grandes écoles&#8221;  (Great Schools) are where the elite of the elite are trained. They are a special category, reserved only for the best.  Their graduates form an elite club. Practically anyone who runs anything in France came through them.   They produce the equivalent of what is France&rsquo;s modern-day aristocracy   &mdash;   just as aloof and snooty as any perfumed grandee from Louis XVI&rsquo;s court. </p>
<p>Hitherto, these schools and these people have been untouched by Diversity. That unpleasant experience fell to the lower classes. It will be interesting, therefore, to see if this new intrusion of Diversity will dampen their enthusiasm for multi-culturalism. Formerly, it did not affect them, so they were indifferent or even enthusiastic, so long as it affected only others. When these sheltered protégées  find themselves competing for places in school and in the job world, that sobering experience may produce some unexpected results. I hope so.</p>

		<p>This people are really traveling all around the world to find white-only places and then write how wrong and evil that would be.</p>
<p>Their luck is that they haven&rsquo;t to search any long: They have only to ask for the lowest crime rate, the best school achievements and a place where you can let your kids play outside.</p>

		<p>It states in the article that the French are &#8216;intelligent and clever but not necessarily creative&rsquo;.  And that &#8216;new perspectives&rsquo; will derive from their interaction with these supposedly more &#8216;creative&rsquo; outsiders.</p>
<p>Yet&hellip;</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
At one recent session, 10 students, all children of immigrants, were working to pass a special concours for a top business school instead of going right into the job market. Their teacher, Philippe Destelle, pushed them to &ldquo;look more self-confident&rdquo; in oral exams and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be afraid to have an opinion.&rdquo; He told one, &ldquo;You have the answers, but you don&rsquo;t trust yourself.&rdquo; <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Do they have the answers?  I equate creativity with the innate curiosity to define something and then, knowing it&rsquo;s inherent characteristics, willing them to be changed.</p>
<p>This is what happens when you have a naturally talkative, child, continually describing and reordering their view of the environment.</p>
<p>Here these immigrants sit, as alone amongst themselves as they would be amongst French students and they say&hellip;  Nothing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Salloumou Keita, 22, is vocal and social, but worryingly behind on his math. &ldquo;We have to prove something,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is a look we always get, a questioning  &mdash;  &lsquo;Can he adapt?&rsquo; &rdquo; <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>No.  It&rsquo;s not a matter of &#8216;adapting&rsquo;, which to a black means ingratiating himself based on personality but of simply -doing-.  Can you handle the math requirements for a position in a business (investments, corporate law etc.) school like ESSEC?</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t, who will apologize to the French indigene student, now too old to compete, who was denied HIS chance to have the good life?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, who will want to deal with you?  Will white French be comfortable with you as they would be with one of their own?</p>
<p>These are serious questions for a student who is already functionally deficited in a key area of his specialty major.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Awa Dramé, is 22, French-born of African parents, confident and talkative. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind being a guinea pig, so long as the experiment works,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Reaching this level was unthinkable before, and I can see myself going higher,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m full of dreams.&rdquo; <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which translates as an expectation that, having put herself on stage she will be accepted simply for having made a spectacle of herself.  &#8216;Confidence&rsquo; is never a problem with black students (though I realize not all Algerians meet that standard) because their early maturity and comparitively high testosterone ratios, even in women, pre-programs their brains to be aggressive and self assertive.</p>
<p>But again, are they -competent- or are they looking at this life opportunity as a means to coast once they penetrate the glass ceiling?</p>
<p>It is a pure sham, in my opinion, to hear that &#8216;all French are created equal&rsquo;.  Nobody going into an institution that creates an elite class of less than 10% of the total population is going to get there without a comprehensive IQ evaluation along with specific aptitude strength testing.</p>
<p>If they will not show these values, _compared to the standard indigene_ norms for concours passers, then obviously, something is being covered up.  And that something is a quota.  No matter how you state it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even agree with the notion of there being some 14,000 students in the gifted/prep school track as a &#8216;test case&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Becaue those 14,000 are already displacing the indigenes who don&rsquo;t get preconditional entitlements.  People who MIGHT have made it on their own.  But now will owe no loyalty to a France that is not about them anymore.</p>
<p>Such is how you engage in social dissolution.  Such is how you tear apart ethnic identity, from the inside.</p>
<p>Stalin did this, with his various internal ministries, as a deliberate act of inspiring &#8216;national chauvanism&rsquo; by destroying social institutions of the majority population.  All so that the nails which stood up could be hammered by the Cheka.</p>
<p>And it worked.  It destroyed the Soviet Economy, long before Hitler could even try.  But it certainly squelched any sense of national association with the country as a whole.</p>
<p>Good Luck France, you appear to be running down a rutted path indeed.</p>

There is a strangeness that goes with activities like this.</p>
<p>It is clear that France has been a french (aka white) nation for quite a long time. Granted there may have been the occasional off-color foreigner on French soil but they were rare.</p>
<p><br>
So who has so much influence they can convince the French, and for that matter the British, Germans, Canadians, Americans, etc. to adopt these very detrimental policies against their very own families (ie nation) ?</p>
