			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>New York Post, July 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama said Thursday that being American &#8220;is not a matter of blood or birth,&#8221; but said that &#8220;no matter how decent&#8221; the 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. are, they should be held accountable for breaking the law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama said Thursday that while America has always defined itself as a nation of immigrants, and while the &#8220;overwhelming majority&#8221; of illegal immigrants come to the U.S. in search of a better life, &#8220;The presence of so many illegal immigrants makes a mockery of all those who are going through the process of immigration legally.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The president called for a &#8220;pathway to legal status that is fair, reflective of our values and works,&#8221; a process he said has been &#8220;held hostage by political posturing and special interest wrangling.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;A matter of faith?&#8221;  What of separation between church and state?  What if I, a native born white American, don&rsquo;t adhere to the faith in question?  Am I not an American by definition, then?</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we can&rsquo;t discriminate against anyone based on &ldquo;blood or birth,&rdquo; then why are we allowed to discriminate against them based on their ability or ambition to come to the United States?  Not everybody in the world has the resources, ability, ambition or desire to sneak into the country.  Their concerns should be first on our minds, the next great civil rights struggle, if you will.  Just give everyone on Earth American citizenship.  Equality now!</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s in the works.)</p>
<p>In this, Barack Obama sounds like a neo-con.  Sam Francis made the ultimate argument against neo-con contentions that the United States is a &#8220;proposition nation&#8221; back in 1995.  Also useful when arguing with liberals, but since liberals = neo-cons on race, it&rsquo;s a moot point.  I&rsquo;ll link to it here, but I must warn you   &mdash;   In this post, I cuss, and have none too kind words for a certain 16-year old white twit R&B; &#8220;singer.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Of course,Obanma doesn&rsquo;t believe a word of what he said in that statement. In fact, he believes in just the opposite. His inteention is to bring about the mass race-replacement of the Native Born White American majority through the importation of high fertility post-1965 nonwhite immigrants. And once Native Born White Americans are reduced to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America, What Barack Obama understands,what high fetility post-1965 nonwhites understand and future nonwhite presidents of &#8220;America will understand is this:the post-1965 nonwhite majority will enforce a racial origins national immigration policy whose intent is to make Native Born White White Americans a permanent ever dwindling racial minority within the orders of America. Only nonwhites from asia,africa,carribean and latin america will be allowed in to &#8220;America&#8221;. Actually, it this will be public policy-in-your-face-public&hellip;very in-your-face.</p>
<p>America is very much about race and place of birth. Its just that Barack Obama wants a nonwhite racial majority.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s in it for the Native Born White Majority? Why should they be in favor of being reduced to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America? Well, Native Born White Americans are under no obligation to commit racial suicide because it would make the foreigner from Kenya happy.</p>
<p>But the president from Kenya&rsquo;s comments are revealing because it so clearly reveals that his intent is to race-replace the Native Born White American majority.</p>
<p>In fact, the news headlines should read:President Barack Obama wants to bring about the race-replacement of the Native Born White Majority by importing high fertility asians,muslims,africans,carribeans and hispanics. This is basically what he said in speech at American University last night.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Barack Obama harbors very nasty intentions towards the Native Born White American majority.</p>

<p>This line on your link is so true.</p>
<p>It is untrue because the major fact about American national identity is that it is an identity created by British settlers and later European immigrants and therefore is almost exclusively the achievement of whites.</p>
<p>America was founded by Whites for Whites ONLY. Try to tell most White Americans this truth and the shouts of racist will be heard around the world. The neo-cons are as bad as the marxist lefties when it comes to racial truths or the founding of America.</p>

		<p>The success of Obama&rsquo;s presidency will be measured by how much Whites suffer.   That&rsquo;s how the Civil Rights Movement is measured.  If you are White and suffer from Integration and Affirmative Action and Diversity, then you are living proof that &#8220;we have come far.&#8221;  If you are not totally demoralized through degradation and dispossession, then you are proof that &#8220;we have more work to do&#8221;.</p>
<p>America is now transformed, and your misery is the token of the morality of the transformation.</p>
<p>Rev. Michael King is a heroic icon to the blacks and their secret handlers because his legacy has been our misery.  Same for Obama&rsquo;s future.  The worse America gets for us, the better he will be held in esteem by the blacks, illegals, and the SPLC, ADL, and ACLU, and the American Center for Progress.</p>
<p>Say it many different ways, but Obama becomes &#8220;iconic&#8221; based upon the sufferings of the White Community.</p>
<p>Miserable White Humanity = Another Victory for the Blacks and their Obama.</p>
<p>In other words, for America to &#8220;fulfill her promise,&#8221; you must be endangered, targeted, and attacked.</p>
<p>How long will the freedom loving Saxon blood bear this injustice?</p>
<p>Where are our Germans?  </p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Just Your Typical Isolated, Angry, Resentful and  Minoritized White Male, who finds nothing good around him but old stories of the successes of Jim Crow</p>
<p>How many White Girls were protected from robbery, rape, and murder by the White Man&rsquo;s Jim Crow Laws?</p>
<p>How many more White Girls have been brutally murdered than was the total number of blacks who were lynched in the name of human justice?</p>
<p>When will we get our Race Reparations for all the White Genetic Treasure that has been lost to the uncontrollable and violent blacks?</p>

		<p>I get pretty tired of hearing the stale cliche that illegal immigrants come to America for a better life.  Everybody wants a better life.  People rob banks in hopes of a better life.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m against non-white immigration because I hope for a better life, and I&rsquo;m afraid that the world just might be such that we can&rsquo;t all have a better life all at once.</p>

		<p>Seems to me quite possible whites will become a minority. And if and when they do our country will become more third world like. Overcrowded with a decreasing quality of life in every regard. Whites built the greatest nation in history and without them there is no one capable of maintaining it. The intelligence and skills of third worlders just isn&rsquo;t there. When the non white hordes take over they won&rsquo;t be able to maintain all the things that made America what it once was. There will be no innovators, no job creators and an economy enabling lives of relative luxury. The hordes will destroy what they came her for. Other great nations have failed because of admitting those of little skills. Takers and not givers. It&rsquo;s like breaking into a rich home. Once you&rsquo;ve taken all of value and have nothing left what do you do then. Obama and his ilk want to destroy the whites but they haven&rsquo;t considered the consequences. At least as I see it. Then too it seem obvious Obama wants to destroy the country as an end to itself. </p>

		<p>You have to write and call your representatives to urge them to stand against illegal immigration to make sure Obama&rsquo;s immigration legistlation doesn&rsquo;t pass before November.  If the Republicans win in November they won&rsquo;t help Obama on anything because they will see their obstructionism as the reason they got elected.</p>
<p>White people made America.  What Obama and other non-whites want you to do is roll out the red carpet for non-white people and let them take advantage of what white people created.  They want you to work in the interests of non-white people because anything else would be &#8220;racist.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s not white people&rsquo;s job to create attractive places so non-white people can come in and take advantage.  If non-white people want to better themselves they can change their own societies instead of coming to white places to change ours.</p>

		<p>This number of 11 million illegals is nonsense. They&rsquo;ve been using the same number for years without change. Perhaps a million a year are turned back each year, how many manage to get through? Add the supposed tourists and students who come here each year and then just stay, it all adds up. Coming up with an accurate number is hard as most are living under the radar. Instead of just swallowing the official line I invite anyone to do their own research with their own eyeballs. In the larger cities notice the large population density in the hispanic neighborhoods. Look at all the students in the public schools and how much has become hispanic. Notice how many workers everywhere, in all stores, restaurants, construction, etc, have followed suit. This has been repeated in every state, every city, every town, for the last 15-20 years. </p>

		<p>I have never understood the &#8220;logic&#8221; of the pro-immigration crowd that because 350 years ago my ancestors were &#8220;immigrants&#8221; (more like pioneers) I have no right to criticize immigration. By this &#8220;logic&#8221; no White southerner has the right to condemn slavery because his ancestor may have been a slaveowner 150 years ago. Or no German has the right to speak out against a future Jewish holocaust. Crazy.</p>

		<p>It has been estimated that 47% of &#8220;Americans&#8221; do not pay any income tax.</p>
<p>Could a (large) portion of that 47% actually be illegal immigrants?  If so, I estimate their numbers to be about 120-150 million   &mdash;   not &#8220;11 million&#8221; or &#8220;20 million&#8221; as our politicians keep spouting.</p>

<p>You really have to get beyond the &#8220;look how clever my debating logic&#8221; approach is. Here, let me lay it out for you:post-1965 nonwhites and their White supporters want to bring about the rapid race-replacement of the Native Born White Majority. In other words post-1965 nonwhites are waging a vicious race war against the Native Born White Majority. This is the only fact and point of logic you need to understand. In your post you have conceded the race replacement issue to post-1965 nonwhites.</p>
<p>You ought to be very glad that in the past immigrants were almost all White. When they say you have no right to criticize immigration what they are really saying is that you have know legitimate racial interests. Or to put it another way:immigration enthusiasts want you dead.</p>
<p>There is no debate. Either you want to be a racial minority within the borders of America or you don&rsquo;t. If you don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s all that matters. Stop trying to be clever with your debating logic. I&rsquo;m not trying to convince immigration enthusiasts of anything. I&rsquo;m reading them the riot act. I state my preference for a White majority. And if liberal immigration enthusiasts don&rsquo;t like it, well, I really don&rsquo;t care. </p>
<p>You are looking for approval from liberal immigration enthusiasts for your racial preference. Well, guess what:you are never going to get it.</p>

		<p>Obama has given up too easily. He says we can&rsquo;t defend the border because it&rsquo;s too long and that 11 million (ha)illegals can&rsquo;t be deported. I&rsquo;ll bet that every American could give him several ways he hasn&rsquo;t bothered to try. We all know the drill:</p>
<p>1. Stop all benefits immediately<br>
2. fix the 14th amendment<br>
3. make E-verifty mandatory at all businesses</p>
<p>And, then, tell Calderon that his people are coming home!</p>

		<p>Obama, through no fault of his own, is a rootless person.  He insists he was born in Hawaii (though he shows no real proof) and grew up partly there and partly in Indonesia.  He displays no genuine affection for ancestral links in the Midwest U.S. or in Kenya and has repeatedly put off trips to Indonesia.  When he states that being an American is not a matter of birth, I&rsquo;m again tweaked with the suspicion that he knows he wasn&rsquo;t born on American soil.  <br>
But, of course, being an American usually IS a matter of birth. If someone is born on the soil or of at least one American parent, he is indeed an American.  Only a minority are naturalized.  <br>
Obama probably thinks of himself as a citizen of the world and, as such, can never understand patriotism.  Only if we are attacked by another planet will his heart be stirred.</p>

<p>You are correct. That number of 11 million or 12 million has been used for years. Knowing full well that a million or so [or more?] each year continue to cross the border.</p>
<p>Just by remittances alone the calculation was made, through extrapolation, that about 20 million is a more precise figure.</p>
<p>In 1984, it was expected the number of illegals applying for the &#8220;one time&#8221; amnesty was going to be around 1 million. The actual figure was 3 million?</p>
<p>They deliberatly low ball these figures not to &#8220;scare&#8221; people. </p>

<p>I agree.  Debates are ultimately useless in the long run.  Jared Taylor can (and does) win every debate with a Raza kook that he has had, but will it matter in 100 years?  When our great-grandchildren are being driven out of the formerly American southwest, &#8220;Gringo get out,&#8221; &#8220;feet don&rsquo;t fail me now,&#8221; they&rsquo;ll look at each other, and take pride in the fact that Jared Taylor won all those debates back in great-grampy&rsquo;s day.

<p>Funny, for someone who claims that Americanism &#8220;isn&rsquo;t a matter of blood,&#8221; he can&rsquo;t seem to apply that simple logic to Kenya.  Most of his foreign policy vis-a-vis the UK is hostile, and is motivated by retribution for British &#8220;atrocities&#8221; in the country which they keep telling us Obama wasn&rsquo;t born in.</p>

		<p>I just want to point out that Barack Obama is cleverly using the logic of the immigration reform movement against itself. For years, the Immigration reform movement has been made nonpayment of taxes and illegal entry into America the fundamental case against immigration. Of course, it easy enough to turn the the debating table around against the immigration reformers:just make the illegals pay back taxes and then legalize them..so what are you complaining about know restrictionist. Of course, in the end the Native Born White Majority ends up getting race-replaced within the borders of America.</p>
<p>The Minute Men are defenseless against the attacks against them in the MSM because they have framed the issue in terms of taxes not paid and legal versus illegal. Shockingly-as Washington Observer has recently pointed out over at vdare.com-the Minute Men are in favor of a massive increase in legal immigration which would accelerate the race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority a lot faster than the current rate of race-replacement. In this regard, the Minute are worthless.</p>
<p>Some much time has been lost. And lots have damage has been inflicted upon White America by framing the immigration &#8220;debate&#8221; on nonracial terms.</p>
<p>I see this framing of the &#8220;debate&#8221; all the time in the  comment section of American Renaissance. There are several of these types of posts in this thread.</p>
<p>In his MSM appearances, Jared Taylor needs to tell his fellow Native Born White Americans like like it is:do you want to be a racial minority within the borders of America and have your fate,your families fate and your the fate of your race in the hands of high fertility post-1965 Asians,Muslims,Africans,Caribbeans and Hispanics. This is a future America where White Americans are dwindling racial minority, the population is shooting over a billion with no end in sight-destruction of open space,forests,very long waiting lists to get into the great national and state parks and violent organized Hispanic and Asian crime syndicates. Life will be very unpleasant for Native Born White Americans if should ever become a racial minority within the borders of America. </p>
<p>They way I have just put it is exactly how Jared Taylor and Peter Brimelow should put it to their fellow Native Born White Americans every time they appear on radio and national TV. Tell it like it is in the starkest possible terms. It&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p>The failure to completely frame the immigration &#8220;debate&#8221; completely in terms of the race-replacement issue and the interests of the Native Born White Majority has-in my opinion-delayed the complete shutdown of all post-1965 nonwhite immigration to 0.  If our fellow Native Born White Americans had been confronted with the race-replacement issue unrelentingly- year after year- they would have revolted-full-blown-against post-1965 immigration policy. The non-tax paying issue and the legal versus illegal issue are so incredibly minor compared to the race-replacement issue. Barack Obama and Rahm Emanuel have used the Immigration Reform&rsquo;s movement own logic against itself.</p>

		<p>Post #16 makes an interesting point.  His mother, Stanley Ann<br>
Dunham, appears to have had a near-hatred for  mainstream <br>
U.S. values.  She appears to have felt that race and nationality had no existence other than within faulty verbal references.  She very much dominated his life  &mdash;  at least up to the point he<br>
insisted in early adolescence that he go live with her parents,<br>
both of whom grew up in small communities near Wichita, Kansas.<br>
Stanley Ann was simply mentally and culturally AWOL.    </p>

(but then it amounts to so what, nothings going to change for the better now). We did it to ourselves is right and i had to live through it. I think a lot of people are wondering when we are going to circle the wagons and unite to defend ourselves. If it hasn,t happened after all the stuff you read on sites like cofcc.org, and this one its not going to happen. </p>

		<p>David Axelrod recently statet that Obama was dealing with unprecedented challenges.  I&rsquo;m sure a few of our previous presidents would not agree.</p>
<p>America has problems that cry out for a firm America first solution. The immigration debacle is a prime example.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s priorities should be:</p>
<p>1) firmly enforce existing laws.</p>
<p>2) firmly secure the border.</p>
<p>3) firmly return all illegals to country of origin.</p>
<p>4) support the states that are enforcing immigration laws.</p>
<p>5) eliminate sanctuary cities/towns.</p>
<p>This is the real solution.  Unfortunately the Obama administration is failing miserably in all of these areas.  This country is in need of some real change that defends and protects America.</p>

		<p><b>Obama said Thursday that being American &ldquo;is not a matter of blood or birth&rdquo; </b></p>
<p>This is a complex and very vexing question. This issue of citizenship and nationhood   &mdash;    who is and who is not   &mdash;   is a central and tormenting issue of our time. It is affecting not only the USA, but most of  Europe and the other white countries of the world. Even our own Indian tribes are being torn by questions of who is or isn&rsquo;t one of the tribe (a Cherokee, etc.).</p>
<p>The neo-cons, former Trotskyites,  are strongly in the corner of those who claim that ANYBODY can be a [such-and -such], and that it is solely a matter of adhering to some basic beliefs. Nationality is no different than living in a ZIP code; anyone can move in or out.  The French government also has long taken this non-ethnic point of view, adding some cultural principals, since their Revolution.</p>
<p>This essentially French approach has deep historical reasons. The modern French state, originally quite small, was assembled over the course of more than a thousand years by the French kings (who had been up until Hugh Capet, arguably the first real king, the Counts of Paris)  by nibbling at their neighbors and enhancing their territories. To consolidate  these gains,  <b>language and culture  were  deliberately used as tools of state </b>in order to forge a unified national identity, making Paris the center of administration and national life.   In fact, there had been no concept of &#8220;France&#8221; in a modern sense as we know it, and until about 1300 (Philip IV), the monarch was  known as &#8220;King of the Franks&#8221;,  not of France.   &#8220;France&#8221; had been merely West Frankia, the broken-off western region of the Frankish Empire.  The French language (essentially the Parisian dialect) did not even become the official language of the realm until by royal edict in 1539. (The official language had been Latin, and various local tongues were spoken throughout the kingdom.) Loyalty, back then, was to the monarch, not to any country or nation.</p>
<p>By contrast, France&rsquo;s ethnically homogeneous neighbors, England and Germany,  were more monocultural and did not have this same need to create  a national identity where there had been none, hence their traditions were based on blood. But the French &#8220;nation&#8221; was largely an artificial, political  creation of the French monarchy.  Hence, we get the two radically different concepts  of nationhood today.  </p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s modern French people (especially after being force-fed a Marxist education)  regard the notion of blood relationship as frivolous, silly, and downright absurd.   To them, it would be simply  laughable, if it were not also suspiciously sinister  and racist   &mdash;   being reminiscent of Nazis and such.   They consider it a silly superstition of the English and Germans, not worthy of enlightened persons like themselves.</p>
<p>However,  though it&rsquo;s been swept under the rug, France has a long racist tradition!  It was really the first country in Europe where scientific racism took root&hellip;. even though that tradition has been pretty much expunged and outlawed today.  I suspect that most modern Frenchmen have never even heard of such writers as Gobineau, a non-person in his own country, whose works have been banned by more than half a century of leftist governments.</p>
<p>There is an extremely interesting article in Wikipedia on this subject of citizenship/nationhood   &mdash;   who is and who isn&rsquo;t  a member of the group.  It covers not just France, but the entire idea in general, and the complex history behind it.  In fact, the idea of nationhood varies  widely among many countries.   I strongly urge anyone who is interested in understanding the subject to read it.  It is somewhat long, but very definitely worthwhile.  See especially towards the end: Nationality, citizenship, ethnicity.   [some quotes below]</p>
<p>&#8220;The classical conception of the nation is that of an entity which, opposed to the ethnic group, affirms itself as an open community, the will to live together expressing itself by the acceptation of the rules of a unified public domain which transcends all particularisms&#8221;.   This conception of the nation as being composed by a &#8220;will to live together&#8221;, supported by the classic lecture of Ernest Renan in 1882, has been opposed by the French far-right, in particular the nationalist Front National, which claims that there is such a thing as a &#8220;French ethnic group&#8221;.   [On the other hand, politicians such as Sarkozy maintain that there is no such thing as a French ethnic group, and that ANYONE can be French.]</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Third Republic (1871–1940), the state has not categorized people according to their ethnic origins. Hence, in contrast to the United States Census, French people are not asked to define their ethnic identity, whatever it may be. The usage of ethnic and racial categorization is avoided to prevent any cause of discrimination; the same regulations apply to religious data which cannot be compiled under the French Census. This classic French republican conception of nationality is officialized in the French Constitution, according to which  <i><b>&#8220;French&#8221; is a nationality, and not a specific ethnicity. </b></i>  Political integration (which includes but is not limited to racial integration) is based on voluntary policies which  <b>aim at creating a common identity. </b>  Since in France, the state preceded the nation, voluntary policies have taken an important place in the  <b>creation of this common cultural identity. </b></p>
<p><b>Therefore,&#8221;a democratic nation is, by definition, multicultural, as it gathers various populations, which differ by their regional origins (Bretons, Corsicans, Flemings&hellip;),  and by their national origins (immigrant, son or grandson of an immigrant), or religious origins (Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Agnostics or Atheists&hellip;).&#8221; </b></p>
<p>According to Ernest Renan in his famous speech at the Sorbonne in 1882, to belong to a nation is a subjective act &hellip; A nation-state is not composed of a single homogeneous ethnic group (a community), but of <b>a variety of individuals willing to live together. </b> </p>
<p><b>Renan&rsquo;s  definition, which forms the basis of the French Republic, is diametrically opposed to the German ethnic conception of a nation, </b> a &#8220;volk&#8221; (a people)  first formulated by Fichte. The German concept is usually qualified in France as an &#8220;exclusive&#8221; view of nationality, as it includes only the members of the corresponding ethnic group, while   <b>the Republican concept thinks itself as universalist,  </b>following the Enlightenment&rsquo;s ideals officialized in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.</p>

		<p>If diversity is so great then why are the countries of Europe that were cobbled together by the powers of the winners of WWII now coming apart? It is a basic instinct that people want to be with their own kind. The Statue of Liberty is a myth. The French gave us this monument but no one wanted to come up with the money necessary to build the base. Jews came forward with the funds but demanded the right to have the poem &#8220;give us your masses&#8221; by the young Jewish girl to be enshrined as part of the legacy. The original intent of the statue, Liberty, was hijacked by Diversity. </p>

<p>I agree with you more than you&rsquo;ll ever know, especially as I live in California on the front line of the (losing) illegal colonist battle and work on the front line of the Culture Wars in the schools. </p>
<p>You write:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In his MSM appearances, Jared Taylor needs to tell his fellow Native Born White Americans like it is&hellip;&#8221;  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Jared Taylor does not often appear in the propaganda stream media  (PSM) while race-replacement pundits have all the air time and print they want to spew invectives at White and label M. Taylor a racist, Nazi and White Supremacist.  Professor MacDonald writes that &#8216;debates&rsquo; he&rsquo;s been invited to pit him against four loud-mouthed, screaming lefties.  I am sure he is threatened as well with physical violence, as is Rushton, Jensen and Horowitz.</p>
<p>The PSM defend the marxists, always.</p>
<p>Of course M. Taylor wins debates with &#8216;Raza&rsquo; types; the facts are on his side. But it is THEY, &#8216;Raza&rsquo; types who receive the publicity and space in the PSM to scream, rant and rave about nativist/racist Whites.  In California, they are increasingly moving into positions of political power, as they will across the Southwest and entire country.  The PSM laud and applaud this.</p>
<p>Brimelow writes that once he started publishing articles by Jared Taylor, Professors Lynn and Rushton and especially Professor MacDonald, the PSM stopped calling  &mdash;  and, in fact,  excoriated him, and on a personal level, even attacking his children and young wife.</p>
<p>As you may know, Brimelow&rsquo;s largest donor pulled out this year (probably threatened) and his site is suffering from a lack of funds to pay the writers.</p>
<p>He wrote about two months ago that he is considering shutting down VDare.com.  I donate what I can, but it is extremely difficult to compete with the vast war chests of SPLC, ADL and Ford Foundation-types that lavishly fund our opponents.</p>
<p>Please donate if you can  &mdash;  to AmRen, VDare, Praag (helps Whites in SA), NRA, Numbers, or OO  &mdash;   even as little as $10.  These small amounts add up and help to get our message out.</p>
<p>We are up against formidable, well-funded opposing forces all the way up to and including the White House, whose fundamental, primary goal is White displacement and destruction.  All policies implemented by this regime lead back to this  &mdash;  the push for amnesty, wrecking of the economy, refusal to prosecute those who intimidate White voters, Hate Speech/Crimes laws directed against Whites, pushes for more non-White favoritism,  National Health Care and increases in refugees from Africa.</p>
<p>You write:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Do you want to be a racial minority within the borders of America and have your fate, your family&rsquo;s fate, in the hands of non-Whites?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is why I&rsquo;ve been singing my posts with this quote lately:</p>
<p>&#8220;Whites living in societies run by non-Whites are in physical danger.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The original heading for this post says &#8220;The President has no idea what an American is&#8221; and that one statement hits the nail right on the head. With Marxist upbringing by his grandparents and mother he then went on this path with his mentor Frank Marshall Davis who was leader of the American Communist Party.  After that he had mentors and friends Saul Alinsky and Bill Ayers who were avid Marxists as well as anarchists. Lets not forget the Rev. Jeremiha Wright who corrupted Obama&rsquo;s mind further with anti-American and anti-white hate propaganda for over 20 years.<br>
    Did anybody ever notice in various news casts the giant pictures of Che Guevera that Obama had in his campaign offices throughout the election?  Che Guevera was Fidel Castro&rsquo;s right hand man in Cuba who executed thousands of political prisoners and was responsible for bringing Soviet missles to Cuba.  Che was also a avid communist and hated America with a passion, but obviously Obama looked up to him or he would not have Che Guevera&rsquo;s picture plastered all over his campaign office walls.<br>
     Obama used a tactic called &#8220;political purge&#8221; that was mastered by Joseph Stalin to get the Senate Seat.  He also used that same tactic along with Chicago thuggery, fraud, intimidation and bullying to get the Presidency.  Now he is using all the above tactics to get Cap&Trade; passed along with Immigration Reform just like he did with Health Care, Stimulus, ect.  Whatever it takes to get total power over the people, that is what Obama will do. Doing what the American people want never enters the picture.  In my opinion the President of the United States ( all 57 of them according to Obama! ) is about as American as &#8220;Karl Marx&#8221; himself.       </p>

<p>Actually, the exact opposite is the truth.</p>
<p>The &#8220;process&#8221; has been held up, or &#8220;held hostage,&#8221; by the fact that whenever the ruling elite attempt to pass their amnesty (er, I mean, &#8220;pathway to citizenship&#8221;) there is always a massive response by a broad MAJORITY of US citizens saying loudly and clearly &#8220;NO!&#8221;</p>
<p>This majority is far from a &#8220;special interest group&#8221; engaging in &#8220;political posturing&#8221; - these are average, middle class Americans. Obama is either lying or dead wrong about who is rejecting &#8220;immigration reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>The elites have run their focus groups this way and that, trying to come up with some recipe for &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; that the majority will swallow like good sheep, but they have yet to pull it off - the majority sees it as amnesty by any other name, and they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>The majority is right to see that amnesty by any other name is NOT reflective of our &#8220;values and works.&#8221; How does sneaking into a country and managing to avoid detection for 10 or 15 years entitle one to citizenship? How does this reflect anything about the best of America? Again, it&rsquo;s the opposite - the logic of Obama&rsquo;s amnesty is the exact opposite of an immigration policy that reflects the best of America.</p>
<p>Hopefully the majority will continue to see through this nonsense, and reject Obama&rsquo;s up is down, down is up gibberish.</p>

		<p>So, according to Obama, &#8220;we&#8221; have ALWAYS described ourselves as a nation of immigrants? Let&rsquo;s look back to the beginning, to 1787.</p>
<p>In Federalist No. 2, &#8220;Publius&#8221; (in this case, John Jay) argues that one of the reasons for the state of New York to adopt the new Constitution is that the United States is already a nation:</p>
<p>     &#8221; &hellip;Providence has been pleased to give this one connected<br>
     country to one united people - a people descended from the<br>
     same ancestors, professing the same religion, attached to<br>
     the same principles of government, very similar in their<br>
     manners and customs, and who, by their joint counsels,<br>
     arms, and efforts, fighting side by side throughout a long<br>
     and bloody war, have nobly established general liberty and<br>
     independence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Funny, for someone who claims that Americanism &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t a matter of blood,&rdquo; he can&rsquo;t seem to apply that simple logic to Kenya. Most of his foreign policy vis-a-vis the UK is hostile, and is motivated by retribution for British &ldquo;atrocities&rdquo; in the country which they keep telling us Obama wasn&rsquo;t born in.<br>

<p>Funny too that only NOW am I reading about &#8220;British atrocities&#8221;. How history is getting revised, as time goes by!  </p>
<p>I am old enough to remember hearing and reading about the Mau Mau terror and the horrible atrocities that were committed BY them  AGAINST the British, with the aim of driving the British out (in which they succeeded).   Now, the story is the other way around. The British were committing the atrocities against the gentle natives!  Truly amazing.</p>
<p>In fact, to take this story further, the terrorist Mau Mau&rsquo;s were basically from the Kikuyu tribe.  The once-fierce Masai warriors, ancient enemies of the Kikuyu, offered the British their aid in putting down the Mau Mau rebellion   &mdash;   if given a free hand to do so in their own way(!) If permitted, the Masai would have made short work of it.   The too-civilized  British turned down this kindly offer of help, precisely wishing to avoid &#8220;atrocities&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Little credit do they get now!</p>

		<p>The excessive logic chopping continues unabated in this thread.</p>
<p>Look folks. As I wrote erlier in this thread, it is not about being much more clever than the immigration enthusiasts in &#8220;debate&#8221;. It is only about one thing:WE oppose an immigration that will reduce the Native Born White Majority to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America and have thousands of highly trained and armed to the teeth Mexicans in the US military and police forces across the America. This is about whether or not Native Born White Americans are foolish enough to put the their fate in the hands of very hostile and very high fertility post-1965 Hispanics,Asians,Muslims,Carribeans and Africans. This is how you respond to Barack Obama and his imported  large and growing hostile post-1965 nonwhhite voting block.</p>
<p>Stop trying to be clever in debate. The enemy doesn&rsquo;t care about your clever arguments. They are only interested in  one thing and that is to make the Native Born White Majority  an ever dwindlinig racial minority within the borders of America as rapidly as possible. Some of you here must stop playing the debating  game. There is no debate. The racial compostion of America is not up for debate. This is the starting point of the &#8220;debate&#8221;.</p>

		<p>When my wife bacame a naturalized US citizen (before Obama was appointed president) one piece of paper she was handed contained a message from George Bush making the same idiotic claim about what America is.</p>
<p>Treason by any other name would smell as bad.  </p>
