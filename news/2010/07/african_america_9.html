			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrick McGreevy, Los Angeles Times, July 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 20 African American religious and community leaders called Wednesday for Alice Huffman to resign as president of the California State Conference of the NAACP after she and her organization endorsed a ballot measure that would legalize marijuana in the state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would the state NAACP advocate for blacks to stay high?&#8221; Allen [Bishop Ron Allen of the International Faith-Based Coalition] said at a Capitol news conference. &#8220;It&rsquo;s going to cause crime to go up. There will be more drug babies.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Prop. 19 is about eliminating enforcement practices that are targeting and creating a permanent underclass of citizens, of African Americans, caught in a criminal justice system while other people, a more privileged class, go free,&#8221; Huffman said.</p>
<p>She cited a recent report by the Drug Policy Alliance, which supports legalization of marijuana. African Americans represent less than 7% of the population but 22% of marijuana arrests, according to Stephen Gutwillig, state director of the alliance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me that you and the California NAACP are as right as you can be,&#8221; [said a statement from Julian Bond, former chairman of the national NAACP]. &#8220;The war on drugs is an absolute failure. It targets black people.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>I think California has de facto legalized marijuana use, so outside a few rural areas, there are virtually no arrests for possession of a small amount.  Therefore, the disproportionality here is probably due to arrests for dealing or transporting weed.</p>

		<p>Julian Bond has proved that a stopped clock is correct twice a day. The asinine war on (some) drugs is an even bigger failure than liquor prohibition was in the 1920s, and for the same reasons. Race has nothing to do with it. The crime and corruption that goes with any black market has everything to do with it. If America wised up and ended the drug war, those Mexican cartels would be out of business in a week.</p>
<p>Recently New York state raised the tobacco tax to the point that a pack of cigarettes in NYC now costs about $15. It&rsquo;s a cinch a black market will soon spring up to smuggle smokes in from low-tax states. New Yorkers who live near a state line will, of course, simply travel to the other state.</p>

		<p>Laws are generally aimed at criminals to stop criminal activities. If any law affects a certain ethnicity more so than others, one must assume they are the law breakers. The fact that blacks are highly offended by most laws is prima facie evidence that they are the main offenders. If the shoe fits wear it.</p>

		<p>Many black people do believe that decriminalization or legalization of street drugs will result in more doping and addiction.  Of course, the end of illegal drugs should mean a lowering of prices, as long as the government doesn&rsquo;t stick huge taxes on them.  It would also place an economic hardship on dope-dealing ghetto blacks, so some black advocates and government officials may fear such an outcome.  <br>
We will never win the drug war.  We should just surrender and let stupid people legally have all they want at reasonable prices.  Then, if a crime is committed under the influence of any drug, including alcohol, hand these criminals 20 or 30 year sentences and deny parole.</p>

		<p>Actually, any form of American law enforcement could be construed as a &#8220;war on blacks.&#8221;  They&rsquo;re arrested at many times the rate of any other racial or ethnic group, they commit crimes at many times the rate of any other racial or ethnic group, they comprise the majority of the prison population in this country, and in general show a much higher of total social dysfunctionality than any other defined group.</p>
<p>Clearly, all of America and the rest of the world are out of step with the social mores, criminal behavior, and lack of social contribution of the black African races.  We must make amends and accommodate their behavior.  Right?</p>

		<p>First time I ever heard anything reasonable emanate from the mouth of an NAACP functionary. Criminalizing marijuana hands a money machine to gangsters and terrorists. Best solution: identify about five drugs, causing the least social damage, and legalize them (any list would surely include cannabis, khat, and alcohol). The variety of legal ways to get high would immediately dampen the appeal of the truly dangerous drugs (such as crack and meth). The federal government should then tax legal drugs and spend the new revenue on programs to  discourage consumption (programs like DARE, except that they really work). </p>

		<p>If the war on drugs equals a war on blacks, then blacks equal drugs?  In other words, the NAACP is on record as saying that more blacks in your neighborhood, state, or country, the more of a drug problem there will be.  Interesting.</p>

		<p>Black groups have been claiming for a long time that the &#8220;White man&#8221; is bringing drugs to the &#8220;hood&#8221; to &#8220;keep the Black man down&#8221;. </p>
<p>But if we Whites try and seal the boarder to keep the drugs and illegal aliens out then blacks say were being racists. </p>
<p>If we try to put the drug dealers in jail then we&rsquo;re being racists.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t perform well at school it&rsquo;s White peoples fault. Not their drug use. </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what we White people do we will always be blamed for their chosen behaviors. The only solution is that we live in separate nations. Non-contact is the only solution to these problems.   </p>

Everyone here sees the truth; when it comes to blacks, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you do.</p>
<p>If you police their neighborhoods and put drug deals in jail, you&rsquo;re racist for targeting blacks. If you don&rsquo;t police their neighborhoods and you don&rsquo;t put drug dealers in jail you&rsquo;re racist because you don&rsquo;t care about black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how the race blame game is played.</p>

		<p>A major bone of contention among blacks has been the high rates of blacks in prison. Yet when someone comes up with an idea to reduce the incarceration rates (i.e., decrim marijuana), other blacks complain. Do they want more blacks in jail or not? This is their chance to do something about it. Kind of interesting how so many people buy into the law-and-order line while at the same time routinely criticizing the police for enforcing the laws they demand.</p>
<p>Another thing I find interesting is the libertarian approach to drug prohibition one often sees among race realists. Perhaps it is because individual liberty, and opposition to massive state powers, are traditional American values. <br>

		<p> I believe the government has a right to control certain substances if it is created by chemistry, including alcohol. But hemp is a plant, a weed, a natural occurring herb. The seeds given by their gods to the Sumerians, where civilization began, were flax, wheat, and hemp. Hemp was legal for thousands and thousands of years, illegal for just over sixty years. I contend that no government has no right to interfere with man&rsquo;s relation to a plant. They talk about going green, while they outlaw a plant that has so many uses that does not harm the earth. Anything that can be made from petroleum can be made from cellulose, and hemp is the most prolific cellulose producing plant on the earth. You can make a container from it that after you drink your cola you can toss to the back yard where it will dissolve into nutrients for the soil in just a couple of years. The plastic from oil will be around forever. At no time when the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 was introduced, which made it illegal, was the plant referred to as hemp. Congressmen and Senators went along for the ride without knowing they were making illegal the number one cash crop of KY. </p>

		<p>Harsh sentencing for crack cocaine came directly from the Democratic congress of the mid-1980s. Somehow, in spite of this, the &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; is blamed on conservative whites. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (which included the Narcotics Penalties and Enforcement Act) was the brainchild of LIBERAL house speaker Tip O&rsquo;Neill and his liberal and black cohorts. How do these angry blacks respond? By voting for the same party that brought them harsh crack sentencing! These people are clearly candidates for MENSA.</p>

<p>Where in the constitution does it give government the right to control a substance because it was &#8220;created by chemistry&#8221;? This line of thinking is completely foreign to me. Is there some other legal precedent for the government to control substances based on the &#8220;created by chemistry&#8221; standard. </p>
<p>Is it your interpretation of natural law. Is there any historical record for this type interpretation? </p>

I did not say the Constitution gave the government the right to control anything created by chemistry. The FDA grew from a small bureau headed by Anslinger, a nephew of J.P. Morgan who was in business with Hearst and duPont. It was these men who propagandised the government to pass the law making hemp illegal. I have come to loathe the Federal Misgovernment. From Wilson to the present we have traitors as presidents, especially Roosevelt and Johnson.</p>

		<p>New Yorkers who want cheap smokes won&rsquo;t even have to travel to another state to get them.  My understanding is that Indian reservations are allowed to sell untaxed tobacco, so all upstate NY smokers will have to do is visit the Mohawk reservation there.</p>
