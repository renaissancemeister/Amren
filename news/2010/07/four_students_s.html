<h1>Four Students Sue Savannah State for Admittance</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kristi E. Swartz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, July 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Four students who have accused Savannah State University of pulling their football scholarships because they are white are now suing the school&rsquo;s president and interim athletic director for admittance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 19-page complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, accuses Savannah State, a historically black university, of acting &#8220;unlawfully, specifically with regard to the decision to deny them admission and athletic scholarships on account of their race, white.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The allegations come two months after Savannah State&rsquo;s former football coach, Robert Wells, filed suit against the school, saying he was forced to resign because his fiancee is black.</p>
<p>Wells, who is white, resigned Jan. 28, one month after he had accepted a one-year contract extension. In his complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta in May, Wells also claims the school is trying to hurt his reputation as a football coach by saying he violated recruiting rules.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit filed by the four students, they were scheduled to visit the university on Jan. 30 and 31 &#8220;to sign their letters of intent to enroll at and play football for SSU.&#8221;</p>
<p>The students&rsquo; scholarships were pulled after Wells&rsquo; departure, the lawsuit states.</p>

		<p>Hopefully the white plaintiffs will win a monetary settlement which they can use to enroll at a college of their choice.  It&rsquo;s a black school, they wouldn&rsquo;t exactly be welcomed with open arms by the black players or administration.  I do find it interesting that the coach was allegedly fired because he has a black fiancee.  Could it be that some blacks don&rsquo;t approve of such cross racial unions?  Would those on the left call them racist for it?  </p>

		<p>It is easy to find out if Savannah State is denying admittance based on race.  Blacks make up about 17% of USA population and Whites make up about 50% of USA population.  Therefore, unless the school is prejudiced against one race, then their student body and football teams should both be about 50% White and 17% Black.  </p>
<p>I wonder what the data are?</p>

		<p>A detailed news clip and accompanying article for the story is here:  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2fsw6uh" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2fsw6uh</a></p>
<p>Interesting story. Watched the entire news clip. Did the coach get fired because his second season was a losing one, because he was white, because his fiancee is black (she is very unattractive BTW), or because he recruited and offered scholarships to 5 white players?  Interesting to note that SSU, a HBCU, has two other longtime white coaches and has white alumni.  Also, SSU did fire a white baseball coach previously and claims it was for racial reasons. The potential white recruit interviewed for this story as well and his family seemed very interested in attending SSU. </p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it interesting that you can still have HBC&rsquo;s (Historically Black Colleges) but you cannot have Historically White Colleges?  In post 1968 America White colleges MUST take in disproportionate numbers of blacks.  Whether they have shown they can do the work or not.  Standards are lowered for them.  My question is WHY in the world would a white WANT to go to a 90% or more BLACK college?  Bigger question: why in the world would a white marry a black woman?  Remember the good old days - when Sammy Davis Jr could not get anybody to come to his wedding because he was marrying a white woman?  Not even his best buddy Frank Sinatra?  And that was in HOLLYWOOD.  Not even the liberal morality absent Hollywood folks approved of mixed marriages back then.  Those were the days.  We&rsquo;ve come a long way baby!  A long way on the path to moral bankruptcy.</p>

		<p>The proper question here is this: Why would white football players want to waste their time and talent at an overwhelmingly black school?  Get a life and go out for the team at a school where you would be welcome and your playing skills appreciated.  In other words, a school that is predominately white.</p>

		<p>To Bill R. and Black Obongo:</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one good reason that whites may end up at a mostly-black school, and that&rsquo;s if the whites had flunked out of a more ethnically appropriate school.  If one flunks out of college, the barriers to transferring to another 4-year school are formidable.  One way to get directly into a 4-year school is to play the &#8220;reverse affirmative action&#8221; game.  </p>
<p>A (white) guy I met a few years ago was kicked out of his &#8220;nice&#8221; college due to serious mental illness and associated academic failure.  One of the HBCUs  &mdash;  can&rsquo;t remember which  &mdash;  took him right away.<br>

		<p>This coach is an idiot.  I cannot see how he managed to crawl his way to the top without knowing more CYA politics than this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s already had at least one run-in with his bosses, during which he has been told that being white with a black wife is a bad idea -and- that the black alumni will never accept him anymore than the majority of white Georgia will (stop advertising your miscegenation on TV or we will stop you).</p>
<p>The method of imposing this dressdown being his supposed &#8216;fault&rsquo; over funds mismanagement by other faculty.</p>
<p>He has also had a losing season that is the complete reversal of his first one which is a quite legitimate complaint.</p>
<p>In his position, given there are actual &#8216;spy shops&rsquo; and multiple online order houses like this one-</p>

<p>What would you do to make sure that your voice and your bosses&rsquo; were recorded so as to verify your side of the story?</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t even have mattered if the administrators he was dealing with were white.  He&rsquo;s in a hole that they have dug for him which should put anyone on the defensive as a function of justified paranoia.</p>
<p>He should have recorded everything, remotely if need be, with the aid of a detective, and then, when they gave him the &#8216;quit or be fired&rsquo; choice, _immediately_ have sought legal advice before giving them his answer.</p>
<p>I swear this guy reminds me of that fool who quit the DOJ before blowing the whistle and now is (predictably) being accused of everything from racial sore loserism to &#8216;outside the loop&rsquo; inability to comment on what he say&rsquo;s he heard as being of more than a &#8220;you weren&rsquo;t actually there&hellip;&#8221; hearsay nature.</p>
<p>As soon as you quit, 80-90% of what you say is true becomes prejudicial, reactionary or dated.  As soon as they FIRE you, everything you say gains credit as the final act of control and intimidation.  That&rsquo;s just the way the legal system works. </p>
<p>In this modern, litigationist crazed, culture; the first thing you HAVE TO do is show a willingness to go to the wall and make it a tough legal fight.  Or they will steamroll you as a passive as much as &#8216;honorable&rsquo; character.</p>
<p>The second thing you HAVE TO do is give your attorney enough evidence (photocopies of documented signing contracts) to make at least an out of court settlement worth the effort of battling through court.</p>
<p>Even if Georgia has some law against such &#8216;illegal surveillance&rsquo;, if these people lied, they lied.</p>
<p>Having it on tape and dropping it on You Tube would then be a fantastic way to impugn their reputations and get -them- kicked off their relevant school board positions.  Because now everyone will know that SSU&rsquo;s faculty guarantees aren&rsquo;t worth the racial politics they actually are a cover for.  And that becomes a poisonous fruit problem for the entire world of academia.</p>
<p>Again:</p>
<p>1.  Never Quit.  Make them fire you.<br>
2.  No matter what the confidentiality contract rules are: Get <br>
    the dirt.</p>

		<p>In the town where I spent my childhood, there was a HBCU just down the road and comparing these students to the (predominantly white) state university was comparing apples and oranges. In many ways, it was an extension of high school, not a place where one picked up useful skills. (Unless you learned how to intimidate white employers into paying you a salary and being able to put your name in the &#8220;quota checkoff box&#8221;.) </p>
<p>Professors that demand real work at HBCU&rsquo;s tend to find themselves out of a job. When you are dealing with most blacks, forget being &#8220;honorable&#8221;, that has to be a two way street and you know that they are not going to hold up their end of the bargain.  </p>
<p>I knew a white guy from middle school who was recruited by an HBCU to play baseball and received a full scholarship. Since his family was by no means wealthy, he took the offer. He lasted two years and then took a shot at single &#8220;A&#8221; ball. After realizing that he was not going to be the next Joe DiMaggio, he decided to become a police officer. I would imagine the time at the HBCU was probably more of an education than the police academy. </p>
<p>To answer Bill R #4: In addition to the federal government mandating that predominantly white schools take unqualified minorities, is there a good possibility that a lot of administrations of colleges and universities are still stuck in this &#8220;we&rsquo;re still in Vietnam&#8221; mentality. How many marginal students who would have just dropped out in 1958 were forced to stay in 1968 to avoid the draft? </p>
