<h1>A Russian Milestone: 1st Black Elected to Office</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>National Public Radio, July 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>People in this Russian town used to stare at Jean Gregoire Sagbo because they had never seen a black man. Now they say they see in him something equally rare  &mdash;  an honest politician.</p>
<p>Sagbo last month became the first black to be elected to office in Russia.</p>
<p>In a country where racism is entrenched and often violent, Sagbo&rsquo;s election as one of Novozavidovo&rsquo;s 10 municipal councilors is a milestone. But among the town&rsquo;s 10,000 people, the 48-year-old from the West African country of Benin is viewed simply a Russian who cares about his hometown.</p>
<p>He promises to revive the impoverished, garbage-strewn town where he has lived for 21 years and raised a family. His plans include reducing rampant drug addiction, cleaning up a polluted lake and delivering heating to homes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;His skin is black but he is Russian inside,&#8221; said Vyacheslav Arakelov, the mayor. &#8220;The way he cares about this place, only a Russian can care.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Inspired by communist ideology, Sagbo came to Soviet Russia in 1982 to study economics in Moscow. There he met his wife, a Novozavidovo native. He moved to the town about 100 kilometers (65 miles) north of Moscow in 1989 to be close to his in-laws.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They already knew him as a man of strong civic impulse. He had cleaned the entrance to his apartment building, planted flowers and spent his own money on street improvements. Ten years ago he organized volunteers and started what became an annual day of collecting garbage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s black population hasn&rsquo;t been officially counted but some studies estimate about 40,000 &#8220;Afro-Russians.&#8221; Many are attracted by universities that are less costly than in the West. Scores of them suffer racially motivated attacks every year  &mdash;  49 in Moscow alone in 2009, according to the Moscow Protestant Chaplaincy Task Force on Racial Violence and Harassment, an advocacy group.</p>

<p>This piece is written in a tongue-clucking tone, but shouldn&rsquo;t the author be clucking at himself (and other leftists)?  </p>
<p>After all, if Russia, which for over three-quarters of a century labored under Communism, was not able to eradicate &#8220;racism&#8221; from the hearts and minds of its people, then who will?</p>
<p>Oh, silly me, the current theory is that exposure to other races (forced if necessary) will eventually snuff out &#8220;racism.&#8221; </p>
<p>But if we were not forcibly exposed to other races, how would &#8220;racism&#8221; be a problem in the first place?</p>

		<p>&#8220;His skin is black but he is Russian inside&#8221;. I&rsquo;m sorry, but to me there is no such thing as a real Russian who is black. I&rsquo;m white and if I were to move to a black African country, I would not consider, nor would I expect the natives to consider, me as a real native of the country. Heck, I wouldn&rsquo;t even consider myself a real Russian if I became a citizen of Russia! The real Russians should themselves improve their communities and cities, so they don&rsquo;t have to elect people like him to do it for them. This is another example of whites being their own worst enemy. I bet his wife was one of those commies brainwashed to believe the whole &#8220;all races are the same&#8221; mantra, so when he came along, she didn&rsquo;t want to go against the &#8220;party line&#8221; by rejecting him. Thanks, Mr. Sagbo and Mrs. race traitor Sagbo, for adding to the population of mongrels in Europe. </p>

		<p>P.S., how much you wanna bet he wasn&rsquo;t inspired by communist ideology to come to Russia, but by a desire to procreate with a white woman? I mean give me a break. He probably saw the kinds of women there are in Europe, compared them to those of his country, and decided he was more attracted to the white ones. If that is the case, then gee, thanks a lot for decreasing the beauty of the Russian population just a bit more, only because you didn&rsquo;t like your own women, Mr. Sagbo.</p>

<p>This is the core of the civic nationalist philosophy that has destroyed Western Europe and North America. It seems that the poison has entered Russia&rsquo;s bloodstream. It remains to be seen whether it will expand. My expectation is that it will. Russians are in an imperialist mode, and because of that, they will see foreigners adopting their culture as a triumph of their civilization, and will seek to expand it. Russia has been trying to cozy up with Third World nations, and perhaps will see Third World migration as a way to cement those ties. </p>
<p>And here I was hoping that Russia would be escape hatch for us Western whites. Oh well. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand this.  What is he doing in Russia? Why is it acceptable for a black person to be in a 100% White country and be accepted?  Get an education, marry a White woman, etc.  What would happen if a lone White man decided to move to black Africa?  Could this same scenario happen there?  Of course not!</p>
<p>He wormed his way in, marry a White (stupid woman in my opinion) woman, and had some kids, got elected as Mayor.  Well that&rsquo;s how it starts, infiltration.  Are White people really just that stupid.  (was she mesmerized by his exotic black skin) Or just too tolerant when it comes to outsiders, I really don&rsquo;t get it at all.  He has no business there, and should have left after he got his, most likely, free education, and went back to where he came from.  She should actually leave with him and the mixed race kids and go to Africa.  See how she is welcomed there!  </p>
<p>He is not a Russian, and never will be, I don&rsquo;t care what they say.  I believe there is more to the story than is being told.  Obviously other people don&rsquo;t feel the same way judging from the teenager, but then he is probably just a racist, right?  These people are completely naive, and too innocent for their own good.</p>

<p>Forced integration will never work!  Could it be that Russian&rsquo;s really don&rsquo;t want a flood of Africans in their country.  This is done deliberately to start the race mixing.  Of course the church is behind this and encouraging the Africans to come right in. They are the problem!   You wouldn&rsquo;t need a Task Force on Racial Violence and Harassment in the first place if the blacks were not there.  Why is it that every White country has to have non White immigration?  Or are they just there because they are doing the jobs the White Russians won&rsquo;t do?</p>

<p>I remember watching the 1970s film, Mandingo, about interracial sexual relationships between white slaveholders and blacks in the Old South. The film was released on DVD in 2008.</p>
<p>I have always suspected that, deep down, whites are sexually and emotionally attracted to blacks. Obama&rsquo;s election, and this story, confirms those suspicions. The fact that white/black relationships were historically taboo, added to the thrill and excitement of the relationships. There are plenty of mulattos in the US, Brazil, Cuba, South Africa, and elsewhere, who provide evidence of white/black miscegenation.</p>
<p>Some posters here are going to curse me for making the statement above. But I ask you to consider the evidence rationally. Russians know exactly how blacks behave, because, they too, watch foreign news about black countries. Russia also had lots of dealings with black communist countries such as Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, and Guinea in the 1970s and 1980s. But the Russians went ahead and elected the black guy to office.</p>
<p>In the slavery days, whites were fully aware of the nature of blacks. But they imported large numbers of them, to the extent that whites allowed blacks to outnumber them in Haiti, Jamaica, Martinique and Brazil. In the American South, economists had proven by the 1820s that slavery was an inefficient economic system, and that a system of free labor would bring more prosperity to the South. But Southerners could not let go of their blacks.</p>
<p>When the 1920s black separatist, Marcus Garvey, wanted to lead blacks back to Africa, whites refused to support him in his task to lead blacks out of America. Violent behavior by blacks is the only thing that keeps whites away from blacks. But when blacks are non-violent, whites seem to view them as cuddly big black teddy bears. </p>
<p>If I am wrong, please explain to me why Martin Luther King has an official public holiday, and not the founder of your country, George Washington. Also, explain to me why former British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, unveiled a statue to Nelson Mandela, who killed whites in terrorist acts. Why did whites in Europe give Obama a Nobel Prize for doing nothing? Why did the city of Prague in the Czech Republic, approve the erecting of a statue to Michael Jackson, when there are virtually no blacks in the Czech Republic:   http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100629/ap_on_en_mu/eu_people_michael_jackson</p>
<p>Interestingly, I am not aware of any African nation that has proposed putting up a statue to Michael Jackson. Africans have more sense than whites. The Czech Republic never enslaved any blacks, or colonized any black nation. Why do they have their black fetish, then? Scandinavian countries never had anything to do with colonialism, but they allowed millions of blacks, including the odious Somalis, to enter their first world societies. Why?</p>
<p>Even in the Jim Crow South, black characters such as &#8220;Uncle Remus&#8221; and &#8220;Aunt Jemima&#8221; were used to market products to whites. Nobody can attribute that to the pro-black propaganda of the post civil rights era. Is there some deep seated psychological reason, that causes whites to have a black fetish? I predict that, in the future, more blacks will be elected into office in Russia, despite the fact that Russia is the world&rsquo;s most pro-white nation. I will conclude by noting that the 1967 Supreme Court decision, Loving vs. Virginia, which overturned Southern miscegenation laws, involved a white man who wanted to marry a black woman, and not a black who wanted to marry a white woman. Why was this the case?</p>

		<p>Deepak N Patel is right. It is a very odd preference on the part of whites and inexplicable to those whites who don&rsquo;t share it, such as me.</p>
<p>Remember the appalling Tony Blair who once declared that he was &#8220;passionate about Africa&#8221; - note the word passionate - without explaining why. His successor as Prime Minister of Great Britain, the unlamented Gordon Brown, wanted the British taxpayer to provide &#8220;an education for every child in Africa&#8221; (!), then there is the whole tear-jerking &#8220;live-aid&#8221; phenomenon.</p>
<p>Why indeed? Misplaced guilt over slavery and colonialism have a lot to do with it, but why then - as Deepak points out - does it infect Czechs and Scandinavians? Answers on the back of a postcard please.<br>

These are just small countries, and they&rsquo;re going with the general cultural trend. Being pro-black and anti-white is what&rsquo;s culturally fashionable at the time.</p>

DeepakNPatel:</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a natural inclination toward the novel and the exotic. It&rsquo;s part of the white western drive to explore and learn.</p>
<p>Another thing is that blacks, like children, seem to elicit a strong sense of caring and compassion from whites. Black simplicity can be misread as child-like helplessness. </p>
<p>This is most evident in white women. White women will be the first to strike up a conversation with blacks and take a motherly-like approach to interactions. I see white women overly animated around blacks. It&rsquo;s like a mother talking to a toddler.</p>
<p>After a while, when the true nature of blacks in revealed in large numbers, it&rsquo;s too late. </p>

<p>THe answer to that is the fact the people in the town had NEVER seen a black person! When my Swiss mother and her swiss husband immigrated to the U.S. in the 1940&rsquo;s they stayed in in the pitch black area of harlem after arriving, not because they were poor, neither of them had ever seen a black person either and they had no clue. </p>
<p>Russians are a whole lot tougher than other whites though, they aren&rsquo;t PC and they won&rsquo;t hesitate to fight, I also don&rsquo;t think the government is encouraging immigration, they are focusing on their own white birth rates instead.</p>

<p>  Mr. Patel, I hardly think the election of a black to office in a Russian town of ten thousand is indicative of a national trend. I would be more convinced if a black became mayor of Moscow or Saint Petersburg.  Sonya Gandhi is the President of the Indian National Congress Party, but I don&rsquo;t see Indians rushing out to elect white Europeans to offices all over India. </p>
<p>As far as the importation of blacks slaves into Brazil, the Caribbean, Haiti, etc., at that time whites were in absolute control of their countries. It would never have occurred to colonial whites that blacks would be allowed to vote and become the equal of whites in those societies  &mdash;  after all, blacks were inferior to whites and all colonial laws reflected that fact.  </p>
<p>It was the influence of the French Revolution and radical ideas of equality that changed white perceptions. Marxism and the discredited racial ideology of Nazism also played a part in changing white attitudes toward blacks. Our privileged elites, anxious to retain power, found it politically useful to promote a superficial cult of racial and class equality.  These elites retain their racial identity but are ready to divide and conquer any opposition to their oligarchic rule.  </p>
<p>As a Southerner, I can say that blacks were always appreciated for their good qualities, which frequently included a good natured, servile, child-like, sense of fun. However, Southerners didn&rsquo;t think they were equals, except before God. Uncle Remus and Aunt Jemima reminded us of our beloved childhood servants; they were not considered sex objects. <br>
 <br>
The influence of American culture through Hollywood and popular music has lead to slavish imitators in liberal Europe.  At present, a gruesome cult of diversity is propagated in all white countries. It&rsquo;s cool to be like the American trend setters. The idealization of black ghetto culture is just one aspect of this insidious process. Misplaced quilt for the colonial treatment of black Africa is also widespread in all of Europe.</p>

There are plenty of mulattos in the US, Brazil, Cuba, South Africa, and elsewhere, who provide evidence of white/black miscegenation.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>Gee, I personally know of NO White as you described above. I get so tired of all this propaganda being spread (just because a few Whites indulge in this miscegenation) that MOST Whites &#8220;fantacize&#8221; about bedding down blacks!!!! Lord, help us all if that is the case, which I do not buy into.</p>
<p> Per ratio to our population just what is that percentage that engage in and believe that miscegenation is soooo desirable? </p>
<p>It is a well known fact we have had infiltrators (enemies) inside our nations (and on forums)whose sole purpose is to destroy White racial loyalty and spread their propaganda and their indoctrination of our young (mush brains) into believing their lies. </p>
<p>Then there are &#8220;laws&#8221; put forth to punish/imprison/ridicule any White who knows any truths and as many Amreners have pointed out many times here, most of us have not succumbed to their lies and expose their agendas. As one article in the Amren archives states, it is ONLY the White race, that has this affliction known as ALTRUISM, which was meant ONLY for their own race, but has been subverted and misapplied to any race but our own!     </p>

		<p>This Bantu is no more Russian, than South Africans Gary Player, Jody Scheckter and Charlize Theron are Zulus. I note he emigrated to Russia when it was still communist-controlled, in 1982. He went there because Africans are attracted by anything that provides free handouts. At this time, the Soviet regime was still promulgating its &#8220;all men are of one brotherhood&#8221; claptrap. He also figured he couldn&rsquo;t get an education in one of those outhouses that pass for universities in Africa.</p>
<p>As to why white Russian women have some fascination with Bantus, I have no idea. I remember years ago, a Russian woman I had been seeing, wanted me to take her to a Bantu &#8220;neighborhood festival&#8221; on Chicago&rsquo;s South side. I told her flat-out I wouldn&rsquo;t do it, and I was candid in citing personal safety concerns.</p>
<p>We stopped seeing each other, shortly after that. </p>

		<p>The <i>attraction</i> of <i>some</i> Whites to Blacks is attributable to a mixture of lust, White guilt/shame, a misplaced sense of owed reparations and personal defiance against a prevailing culture. </p>
<p>The potency of such engrams (auto suggestion) are greatly strengthed AND legitimized by teachers, community/religious leaders, eg, (Mayors, MPs and clerics) articulating the usual death mantra of racial acceptance, multiculturalism, diversity, tolerance of mass immigration/asylum and &#8216;love they neighbour as thyself&rsquo; rhetoric which is largely, but not entirely, responsible for White suicidal behaviour.  It only takes a minority element of decedance seekers and self-haters to eventually bring down the whole.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safe to bet that the poisioned chalice of Marxist Liberalism has already infiltated Russian society from city life into its remote country life sphere.<br>

		<p>I also think there&rsquo;s truth in Deepak&rsquo;s post. I remember reading Arthur Kemp&rsquo;s March of the Titans, who presented evidence that the ancient Greeks mixed with Africans in the post-Alexander Hellenistic era, and pointed out artwork that made it seem like they were eager to mix with and integrate these dark-skinned foreigners. </p>
<p>The Tocharians are another example of extinct white people that may have mixed with non-whites. The modern-day Uighurs and other peoples of Central Asia occasionally produce fair-skinned, blond-haired people who almost pass for Europeans, but they are rare. Oddly enough, the Kyrgyz oral legends claim that their ancestors once had red hair and blue eyes. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, but this desire to mix with foreigners and integrate them seems to be ingrained in whites. At the very least, history is repeating itself. Will we learn from the ancient Greeks, Tocharians, and Kyrgyz? Or will we settle for extinction, with (if we&rsquo;re lucky) enough of a genetic presence in the new multiracial human gene pool that our phenotypes will occasionally appear, like a bizarre mutation. </p>

		<p>Think about it.  This black man was elected ONE OF TEN councilors in a city of 10,OOO.  Is this such a great feat?  How many candidates were there?  And if the ten top candidates by number were chosen, he might have gotten only a handful of votes!  Leave it to NPR, however, to tout this as an earth-shaking change!<br>
Now, let me answer some of the concerns raised by DeepakNPatel in #19.  I grew up in the South in the 50&rsquo;s, and, believe me, there was no great attraction of whites for blacks.  There still isn&rsquo;t.  White men used to take advantage of the lax morals of some black women before more white women were available, after the sexual revolution, for casual sex.  The products that used black characters to market products were those like food and cleansing items because blacks were reputed to know a lot about good cooking and housecleaning.  Streets named after MLK and the like were to try to mollify blacks, and the aptly (and purposefully) chosen Loving vs. VA used plaintiffs that were less objectionable than a black man and white woman.  Though I can&rsquo;t speak for Northern cities and sophisticated liberals, black/white unions in the South are still largely  &mdash;  though silently  &mdash;  frowned upon.</p>

		<p>Mr. Patel, I can&rsquo;t fully explain the phenomena you are referring to.  I do not share this &#8220;passion for Africans&#8221;.  However, I have spent much of my life around this type of white person, and I&rsquo;ve puzzled over this same thing.  The best way to explain it is, pets.  Blacks are adored like some twisted sort of pets to these people.  They are tokenized and, coddled, put on pedestals like a prized pet.  They&rsquo;ve contorted our whole society to be complicit in the care and feeding of their pets.  Much like our children bring home stray animals, promising to feed and care for them- then forgetting about it in two weeks and dumping their care on the parents.  Few with eyes can fail to see the paternalistic attitude of the white liberal towards these people.</p>
<p>As for the sexual aspect of it, that&rsquo;s not as common as you think, but it does happen.  It&rsquo;s been noted by many the strange and almost sensual relationship between women and horses.  We call them Horsey Girls.   Anybody that spends time around Horsey Girls knows what I mean.  The attitude of the white liberal towards blacks seems to stem from the same psychological foundation as that of the Horsey Girls; at least, this is my observation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this was necessarily the what went on with slave owners past 1820, although I&rsquo;m sure the phenomenon was present in that society.  I think a large reason to keep the system going was because they just didn&rsquo;t know what else to do with them.  Inflicting them on the rest of society was unthinkable.  <br>

		<p>Went to Moscow to study &#8220;economics&#8221;.  Right.  That&rsquo;s a euphemism for went there to study revolutionary marxism and how to destabilize a country.  MANY Africans were invited to Moscow to do such studies.  Many of the known revolutionary figures now running African countries studied their terrorist trade in the Soviet Union.  The Soviets, frankly, hate blacks and disparage them, but they were useful idiots in the most explicit term &#8220;idiots&#8221;.  Also, what is laughable, is the absolute contempt Saudis and other semitic muslims hold blacks in - yet you have blacks running to Islam rather than accept the &#8220;white man&rsquo;s&#8221; religion.  I&rsquo;ve talked to Saudis.  And Russians think blacks are retards and animals.  They were useful, though, in throwing out the white European colonial powers, with the Soviets thinking the black Africans would invite them in to rape the rich resources out of gratitude.  They soon found, like we, that blacks HAVE NO GRATITUDE for the hand that feeds them or enables them.  </p>

		<p>This is a tactical move for Russia&rsquo;s conquest of Africa, they need a figurehead. They&rsquo;re grooming another brother besides this Sagbo. Proof lies in Russia&rsquo;s church having discouraged inter-marriage with Caucausics &amp; C. Asians a year ago, plus Moscow cracked down on its biggest illegal immigrant open market last year, not to mention passing legislation restricting retail jobs to ethnic Russians in 08. Russia wont be importing AfroLabor, they need a Useful Idiot to help oust U.S OIL from W. Africa</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the case that these countries have a &#8220;black fetish&#8221;. I know that some white men have a fetish for black women, but this is by no means the reason for the huge deluge of blacks into Europe. I think it may be international bodies of law, like the UN, that make the politicians of said countries accept non-Whites under some kind of threat. Or, perhaps it&rsquo;s the politicians themselves that are benefiting in some way from such agreements. Another, more certain reason, is for cheap labor. The profit motive drives people to do almost anything, including ruining the demographics of a country. Personally, I would rather have a slower economy and an indigenously pure population, than a fast-growing economy with a large segment of the indigenous people misplaced by those of a different race. After all, what good is economic prosperity if your enjoyment of life is hampered by an invasion that replaces racially attractive people with those who are, let us say, cosmetically and/or culturally challenged?</p>

		<p>Spinning Head, I don&rsquo;t think she married him for his skin. It was most likely due to her wanting someone to take care of her financially, or to at least supplement her income. That&rsquo;s the main reason most women get married anyway, and as long as that&rsquo;s the case, there will unfortunately be miscegenation.</p>

<p>There is no psychological explanation for whites having a fetish about blacks.  It is the work of Marxism, that often said that institutions like marriage and ideas of fidelity were to be destroyed with all other establishment standards.  This was The Decemberists policies in the 19th century. As every little foothold has been made, any act of reasonable justice has been exploited to the limits, until today we have propaganda aimed at us 24/7.  It is so prevalent that most people don&rsquo;t notice it anymore. </p>

Why don&rsquo;t these wonderful Africans ever stay in Africa and try to improve Africa? Why don&rsquo;t they work to improve the lot of their own species?</p>
<p>Because, they know it would be useless. Nations of Africa are just like a one way black pit, with money poured into these nations just going one way, mostly down a black pit. You could continue to pour billions of dollars in trying to improve the lot these 3rd world poor African nations and in the end, you would still end up with, 3rd world poor African nations. Even most black Africans know that they are not capable of maintaining and running their own governments that are comparable to the standards of white western and European nations. I think most of them are not even capable of maintaining civilized nations period. </p>
