<h1><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/13/AR2010071305864.html?sub=AR">A Vote for Doing Away With Race-Based Politics</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Courtland Milloy, Washington Post, July 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} A Washington Post/ABC News poll released Tuesday showed that President Obama&rsquo;s approval ratings have reached &#8220;a new low among whites, at 40 percent, with his positive marks dipping under 50 percent for the first time among white college-educated women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does race have anything to do with it? You betcha.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To hear whites tell it, what really bothers them is a growing federal government that they fear will intervene in their lives  &mdash;  unless there&rsquo;s an oil spill along the Gulf Coast, of course, in which case their complaint is too little intervention. Budget deficits are a worry, too, unless it&rsquo;s George Bush running up the red ink.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whites, for instance, are overwhelmingly in favor of Arizona&rsquo;s immigration law, according to most polls. And virtually none of the surveys has shown any concern for the rights of nonwhite Hispanics who would be subject to racial profiling and illegal search and seizures. These are the same people who like to wave copies of the U.S. Constitution and claim Obama is curtailing their freedoms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Amazing, really, how people from German, Irish, English, Italian, Polish, French, Welsh, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian and Russian backgrounds can land on American shores and coalesce around a racial category concocted solely to exploit others.</p>
<p>Enter the pitiful &#8220;tea party&#8221; movement  &mdash;  made up largely of well-educated and well-heeled whites. How desperately they cling to privileges that accrue from their skin color, going so far as to proclaim themselves victims of reverse discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As for those who would claim that blacks relish their racial designation as much as whites do theirs, just remember that if white people didn&rsquo;t insist on being white, there would be no such thing as race.</p>

<p>A valid complaint, perhaps, but it sounds as if someone from High School wrote this. Also, nearly half of whites voted for Obama&hellip; Is the writer trying to embarrass the very positions he&rsquo;s pretending to espouse?</p>

		<p>The writings of Courtland Milloy and his intellectual clones at other major newspapers go a long towards explaining the collapse in the circulation numbers of those papers.  Why pay for a rag that tells you it&rsquo;s wicked to be white?  I canceled the subscription to my local newspaper years ago because I was sick of their advocacy of illegal immigration and anti-white discrimination.  Why should any white person want to buy the Washington Post when it lectures them about their so-called &#8220;white skin privilege&#8221;?  That is the same Washingon Post that several years back published a picture of Hannibal as a black.</p>
<p>Naturally Courtland has no quarrel with the Obama administration refusing to prosecute cases of blatant discrimination against whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Budget deficits are a worry, too, unless it&rsquo;s George Bush running up the red ink.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bush deficits were disastrous, not least because they gave the Democrats the cover they needed to have even bigger deficits.  The Obama deficits are three times bigger than the Bush deficits.  Size matters.</p>

<p>The deficit for the last Federal fiscal year budget within both a Republican President and Republican Congress was FY 2006 (Oct 2005 to Sep 2006), was a &#8220;paltry&#8221; $161 billion.  The deficit for June 30, 2010 alone was $166 billion.</p>
<p>Those days were Halcyon compared to what we&rsquo;ve got now.</p>
<p>The only thing which might make this 2006 figure deceptive is that the first baby boomers didn&rsquo;t start collecting Social Security until 2008, the Bush- and GOP congress-passed Medicare Part D didn&rsquo;t fully kick in until after this budget.  So Bush/Frist/Hastert benefited from some lucky circumstances, at least here.  Now, the first of the boomers go on Medicare next year, and ObamaCare is right around the corner.  This $1.4 trillion deficit of Obama/Reid/Pelosi will itself seem halcyon in a couple years.</p>

<p>Blacks view EVERYTHING through the prism of race and are the most biased group of people on the face of the earth.  Every decision they make is based on their race and how it effects them, never as the community or country as a whole.</p>
<p>Because this black doesn&rsquo;t understand that the problems starts and ends with blacks, he&rsquo;ll never understand that the solution involves segregating blacks from other races, and he&rsquo;ll be ignorantly blaming everyone and everything but blacks for problems that are created and now exist where there involves black participation. Having severe delusions do him no good as well.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it said time and time again: white privilege comes from skin color. An odd statement, I should think. As if somehow having low levels of melanin gives us westerners our scientific breakthroughs; our engineering marvels; or even simply, our safe neighborhoods. This cannot be so: Japanese people possess a darker skin tone than whites and still manage to cope, both in America and in their homeland. Further, the Mongolian people have a skin color similar to the Japanese and have far less to show for it. So as far as skin color in and of itself being the power behind prosperity, it&rsquo;s simply not the case.</p>
<p>I suppose the next argument is that it is because of oppression and discrimination that we whites live &#8220;the good life&#8221;, taking what we want through force. But we whites were living much better than anyone else before slavery; indeed before colonization. Hell, the Romans had indoor plumbing long before the birth of Jesus. Oppression and discrimination can&rsquo;t therefore be the key to our prosperity, for this existed before such discrimination was even possible. If you think about it, even a little, it&rsquo;s plain to see that much more money has left white hands to go into black and minority ones than has ever or could ever flow in the opposite direction. So much for our discriminatory, oppressive ways&hellip;</p>
<p>What else could it be, if our prosperity is not directly an effect of the color of our skin (presumably through magic), and neither is it our supposed oppression of other races of people?<br>

		<p>Milloy would fight you tooth and nail if you tried to get your race changed to &#8220;black&#8221;. </p>
<p>You could tell him that you had &#8220;one drop&#8221; of black blood and therefore looked white, but really were black deep down inside, since that is what the one drop rule means.</p>

<p>Concocted?</p>
<p>To exploit others?</p>
<p>This is the most incredible passage I have ever read from the mind of a black. It&rsquo;s astounding, and he makes no effort to explain it.</p>
<p>If I read him correctly, he&rsquo;s saying the indigenous white Europeans were not a collective entity until they arrived on America&rsquo;s shores, and then they conspired to collectively act against people who were of different - dare I call them - races.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s best to ignore these black racists. They are incapable of improving the quality of life anywhere they exist. They bitch about whites bewause that&rsquo;s all they know. Critical thinking is beyond their abilities. But note their actions, e.g. immigration, not emigration; integration, not segregation. The crazy white liberals know that to help these people, they must be mixed in with whites. Hence Sec 8 housing, school busing, etc. No one would suggest the reverse! And pls note that public housing is nearly all black. Proof that they are different from most others.</p>

		<p>The premise of this article is so ridiculous that one might suspect it came from The Onion.  In a nation where 95% of blacks unerringly support the black President, to accuse whites  &mdash;  who still support Obama in the 40 percentiles  &mdash;  of race-based politics is beyond laughable!  <br>
You can bet that if ignorant, ill-bred white Canadians were illegally invading the U.S. in the millions and importing huge quantities of dope, spreading crime, depleting funding for schools and hospitals, and taking American jobs, people would be just as up in arms as they are over south-of-the-border illegals.  One-third of American Hispanics admit to being for the AZ law, and probably more would be if the law were fully understood and the truth were told.  Are these folks racist against their own kind?  <br>
Anti-Tea Party people always refer to the movement as &#8220;pitiful&#8221; or some other derogatory term.  Of course, if it were really weak and ineffectual, the critics wouldn&rsquo;t even bother to mention it.  <br>
This article is on an intellectual level with an elementary school newsletter.  It makes me wonder if this is what WaPo expects from its black journalists.</p>

		<p>Hard to read this rant all the way through without bursting out in laughter.  All the posters have made good points, and there is enough fodder in  Milloy&rsquo;s piece to write a treatise.  Most of all, it is about the mind-set of what passes for black intelligensia and journalists in this country that they (1) see everything through the prism of race (as has been noted here and before) (2) resent whites for their success; (3) have no understanding how wealth, successful societies or civilizations are created; (4) feel sorry for themselves; and (5) are hypocritical in the extreme (one standard for whites, another, or none, for themselves).</p>

		<p>The last paragraph that was omitted clearly sums up that this columnist is completely delusional.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eventually, though, demographic changes will render such designations all but meaningless. Despite resistance from those who have a death grip on white privilege, we are becoming a nation of people having origins not in geography but in humanity. Some day soon, let&rsquo;s hope, each of us will be a minority of one, and when we go to the polls we&rsquo;ll vote as Americans.&#8221; </p>

<p>Yeah, here it is, the schematization of the opposition to Obama as &#8220;well-educated and well-heeled whites.&#8221; Straight out of the Marxist playbook. But then again, what else can you expect from the Washington Post? Doesn&rsquo;t this fool grasp that we are in a Depression? A great way to beg several questions - notably (1) why would the well-educated now oppose Obama? Could it be because they have seen through his empty platitudes and slogans, and understood that he has nothing to offer, other than more of the same policies that have created our current crisis? Just food for thought. (2) What if the claims of reverse discrimination have a factual basis? Or does being European-American somehow automatically invalidate any such claim? Presumably, in his mind it does. What other conclusion can anyone draw, based on this article? Finally, if that isn&rsquo;t racism on his part, then what in Hell is it? </p>
<p>This writer is one of the most intellectually dishonest I&rsquo;ve encountered, and that has nothing to do with the fact that he is black. It has everything to do with his attitudes and beliefs. </p>

<p>What on earth is this supposed to mean? What does &#8220;insist on being white&#8221; mean? I don&rsquo;t &#8220;insist&#8221; on being white. I was born that way. Does it mean that I&rsquo;m not supposed to prefer a white female as a mate? Or that I not have any mixed feelings (pardon the expression) when I see Ellin Nordegren with Tiger Woods? What else could it mean, if not that? I say to Hell with this kind of subtle intimidation. The epithet &#8220;racist&#8221; is a weapon of terrorism and thought-control. It is analogous to being accused of witchcraft in the 17th Century. I am a card-carrying intellectual. I have also had enough. The conditions under which we now live and operate can only be compared to Stalinist Russia. People must have the courage to speak out, admit their preferences, and yes, biases, and reclaim the entitlement to their own individuality, rather than to some PC party-line.  </p>

<p>Are you kidding me?  That is one of the most asinine things I&rsquo;ve read here in awhile. In actuality, if every white person in America disappeared tomorrow, blacks, latinos, asians and every other minority would be at each others throats within 24 hours, after the celebrations ended, of course.  Blacks don&rsquo;t relish their racial designation, indeed.  They are absolutely obsessed with themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious, has this guy ever traveled anywhere besides 10 miles outside the Beltway?  Let&rsquo;s buy him a ticket to China, and he can find out how much race is just a construct of white folks.</p>
