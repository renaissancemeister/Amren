<h1>Latinos Not Flexing Political Muscle  &mdash;  Yet</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kristi Keck, CNN, July 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Latino influence in elections has increased steadily over two decades. But turnout this year is unpredictable, experts say.</p>
<p>Each election cycle is dubbed &#8220;the year&#8221;  &mdash;  a time when Latinos will show up at the polls in droves and transform the political landscape.</p>
<p>President Obama&rsquo;s renewed push last week for immigration reform has brought with it fresh expectations for the Latino vote in November&rsquo;s midterm elections.</p>
<p>The issue is considered one of symbolic and substantive importance for the community. Four out of five undocumented immigrants are from Mexico or another part of Latin America, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Hispanics are not punching at their weight,&#8221; said Mark Hugo Lopez, associate director of the Pew Hispanic Center. &#8220;Their share of voters doesn&rsquo;t quite match their share in the general population.&#8221;</p>
<p>But if mobilization efforts change that, the group could be a key voice in November. A study from the pro-immigration reform group America&rsquo;s Voice suggests that Latinos could play a key role in 37 congressional races.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Going into 2010 and 2012, there is a big question mark on Latino behavior,&#8221; he [Antonio Gonzalez, president of the William C. Velasquez Institute] said. &#8220;Latinos have suffered so badly from the economic depression. Latinos are very angry about the immigration debate, and we&rsquo;re getting killed in home foreclosures.&#8221;</p>
<p>At 15.8 percent of the population, Latinos constitute the largest minority group in the United States. African-Americans make up 12.3 percent of the U.S. population, according to the Census Bureau. In 2008, turnout for black voters was 65.2 percent and 67.2 percent for white voters. For Latinos, turnout was 49.9 percent, according to Pew.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The issue is not that Latinos are disinterested in politics,&#8221; said David Leal, an associate professor of government who focuses on Latino politics at the University of Texas at Austin. &#8220;Instead, Latino turnout reflects the larger underlying factors that structure the vote for everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gonzalez said there are two reasons for the upward march: Latinos are the fastest-growing group demographically, and for the past generation, there&rsquo;s been a strong push to improve participation.</p>
<p>Still, he said, claims that Latinos played a major role in swinging the presidential election for Obama were &#8220;over-reported.&#8221; Latinos have a solid enough population to swing state and local elections, but &#8220;Latinos alone can&rsquo;t swing presidential elections,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Obama captured about 67 percent of the Latino vote in 2008, compared with President Bush&rsquo;s 44 percent in 2004.</p>
<p>Leal said people tend to overestimate the influence of the Latino vote when they focus on population growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;While Latinos may be the largest and fastest-growing minority group, the key word in that description is minority,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The best way to assess their political influence is probably not whether they are regularly deciding presidential elections.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2008, Latinos were more a part of a winning coalition for Obama than they were responsible for swinging it for him, Leal said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They may have made the difference in a few closely divided states, but when states are that closely divided, many groups can probably claim credit,&#8221; he added.</p>

		<p>I sure wish we had some politicians willing to deport these millions of illegal immigrants <i>before</i> they start &#8220;punching their weight.&#8221;  But I have no optimism.  The Democrats are counting on legalizing the foot soldiers of La Reconquista as a means of permanently locking in their power.  During the years of Reagan, Bush the Elder, and Bush the Lesser, nothing was done about the growing numbers of illegal immigrants except to talk about how these people with a 50% illegitimacy rate have great family values and are sure to join the Republican Party.  (In their typical simple minded fashion Republicans equated high fertility rates with &#8220;family values&#8221;.)  Ronald Reagan even signed off on the first big illegal alien amnesty, although he later admitted it was the biggest mistake he ever made.  Too little, too late, Ron.</p>

<p>They may have the numbers but how many are here legally and able to vote?</p>

<p>What makes you think illegals can&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t vote?  A statistical analysis done after the 2000 elections showed that at least 3 million illegal aliens voted.  The canvassing boards in illegal alien heavy states are run by Hispanics and white liberals.  Do you think they&rsquo;re going to turn away undocumented Jose when he gets a drivers license with his Matricula Mickey Mouse card at the DMV and Motor-Voter makes the DMV cross register him to vote?</p>

		<p>Whenever an illegal votes it cancels out an American&rsquo;s vote.</p>
<p>Elections via &#8220;secret ballots&#8221; will always be corrupt and fraudulent, because ones vote can never be confirmed.</p>
<p>When people refuse to play the game by the rules they are usually thrown out of the game.</p>
<p>Since Hispanic legals and illegals are united in their quest to loot and conquer our country we must not allow them to vote.</p>
<p>Let them complain about it all they want; their opinions mean nothing anyway&hellip;</p>

		<p>The term &#8220;Latino&#8221; is meaningless. Mexicans are not Salvadoreans, Chileans, Cubans or Dominicans. Many Latinos, so called, are white:Look at them, examine their English, often excellent, and their education. Some socalled Latinos can&rsquo;t speak English and look like Mayan statues. Others look the same as a French or Italian person. Many have blonde hair.  LA Latinos are not Latinos everywhere. </p>
<p>White Anglo Saxons and European Americans must shave off the white sector of the media created Latino base.  The key to white survival in America is two fold: knowing our European heritage, and making allies with &#8220;neo&#8221; Europeans, i.e., Latinos who are really white.  </p>
<p>If someone from Latin America is highly literate in English, believes in capitalism, and opposed socialistic handouts to the ignorant greedy mob of blacks, illegals, and just plain morons of any color, they are culturally white. </p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
Intermarriage with white Latin Americans by European Americans is a whole different ballgame than intermarriage with blacks or Asians(and look at all those pretty Chinese girls onthe arms of white young men. never hear a peep about THAT on AmRen.)</p>

		<p>To poster #5, you are quite correct that a lot of &#8216;latinos&rsquo; are white, but the powers that be have lumped them together with the indians and mestizos.  I have a kid in my high school class who is 100% Italian from parents who are 100% Italian, but who had immigrated to Venezuela before their son was born.  So he goes around saying he&rsquo;s a what? - a Latino!</p>
<p>The whiter looking spanish speakers I teach seem to gravitate towards white american culture than the mestizos and indians.  We need to enhance that wedge and bring them over to our side.</p>
