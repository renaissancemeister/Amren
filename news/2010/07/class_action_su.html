<h1><a href="http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/localnews/ci_15560561">Class Action Suit Claims Employment Discrimination by Bus Company</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Angela Hill, Oakland Tribune, July 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Oakland woman is the lead plaintiff in a federal class action lawsuit against the Ohio-based First Transit bus company, one of several service providers for East Bay Paratransit, claiming the company&rsquo;s hiring policy barring applicants with felony convictions is discriminatory against blacks and Latinos and violates civil rights and fair employment laws.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed Tuesday in U.S District Court in San Francisco on behalf of 44-year-old Adrienne Hudson, is backed by the nation&rsquo;s largest transit unions. It asserts that, because blacks and Latinos have a higher incarceration rate nationally, employment-selection policies based on criminal background checks  &mdash;  such as First Transit&rsquo;s  &mdash;  have &#8220;a disparate impact on African-American and Latino job applicants and employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The suit states that Hudson, who is black, was hired at First Transit&rsquo;s Oakland office in 2009. She trained for three weeks and was driving a bus for only two days when she was fired after her background check came through, revealing a 2002 felony conviction for welfare fraud, which was later reduced to a misdemeanor and eventually dismissed in 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The suit seeks monetary damages and an elimination of such hiring practices.</p>
<p>Officials with the Amalgamated Transit Union, the nation&rsquo;s largest union of mass transit workers, say the policy violates the 1964 Civil Rights Act which states employers can&rsquo;t base hiring on a past felony conviction if it would disproportionately impact minority groups.</p>

		<p>I might need correction here, but I think CRA &#8216;64 allows for employment discrimination based on past criminal history, but only allows for employers to check for and make decisions based on felony convictions (not felony charges or misdemeanor convictions or anything else) only.</p>

		<p>From this article the charges were lowered to a misdemeanor and then dropped. Based on this information she does have grounds for a lawsuit. A couple of years ago a &#8220;security&#8221; program vetting workers and truck drivers entering certain ports was begun. It was a nightmare since people who had felonies from 25 years ago and long set aside were harassed and threatened with losing gainful employment even though the offence was expunged except for if the person reoffended. Worse yet people who were merely arrested and no charges filed or charges dropped had to explain themselves and show paperwork. The stupid thing about this program was that foreign crew members of ships could enter without any sort of vetting and there would be your terrorist!</p>

<p>So, in other words (according to this union), it&rsquo;s okay to deny a white guy with a felony conviction, but you better not deny a &#8220;minority&#8221; with a felony on their record.</p>

		<p>When you apply for a job and fill out an application there is a question &#8220;Have you ever been convicted of a felony&#8221;? If you lie on the application you have committed fraud.I would think that either this question is not on the form or if it is she lied.The removal would not be for her past criminal record but for lying.</p>

		<p>I think this suit doesn&rsquo;t go far enough!  Social justice demands this to be a nationwide, across-the-board precedent!</p>
<p>Past criminal activity, if no longer valid as an employment screen for bus drivers who drive our children to school, should also not bar a person from being a teacher, day care worker, nurse, police officer or even secret service agent!</p>
<p>To heck with the whole system of standards!  If you have minimum standards of education, honesty and ability then it&rsquo;s going to discriminate against someone eventually!</p>
<p>Look at many third world nations where the only standards you need to pass are the ability to give and receive bribes.  And those places are social justice paradises where no discrimination ever occurs!</p>
<p>On a side note, it is most probable that those bus companies service large minority districts, so if they want people with criminal records to drive their kids to school, it won&rsquo;t bother me because that&rsquo;s what they want.</p>

		<p>This particular woman did have a claim according to the rules under which she was hired, and she won her case.  Evidently, in the course of things, a do-gooder group jumped into the fray and pushed the concept of racial discrimination along with her personal suit, which had nothing to do with race.  <br>
Public transit is not going to be forced to hire felons because doing so might hurt business.  And the courts now defer much more to the elite rich than it does the poor, minorities or not.</p>

		<p>Three Comments:</p>
<p>1.  Why did the woman lie on her application form?<br>
It used to be that lying about your criminal history, even if only for an /arrest/ was sufficient to get you fired.</p>
<p>2.  How many people who had NO criminal record were screwed over so that this company could fill a quota wherein she is insured for the value of the passengers, the vehicle and the luggage?</p>
<p>3.  Was the woman guilty of the crime?<br>
If it was subsequently knocked down &#8216;for the convenience of the court&rsquo;, it is the same as saying she did indeed commit felony fraud and the court system is in collusion with her to cover up her criminal record.</p>
<p>Someone needs to grow a pair and COUNTER SUE for the full value of litigation and &#8216;damages&rsquo; equivalent to the lost time spent fiddling with this nonsense.  So that the Feds and their Civil Rights Thugs can be on the losing side a few times.</p>
<p>The 1964 CRA does not protect felons.  It SHOULD NOT protect those who lie about felony arrests and then wonder why their past comes back to them.</p>
<p>And while we&rsquo;re at it, let&rsquo;s sue whatever vetting company is taking TWO DAMN YEARS to clear the employees of this undoubtedly insured bus service for putting passengers and vehicles at risk and due to increase premiums likely to be incurred for having someone with a criminal record on a rider that says all covered agents of the company are clean.<br>

		<p>If a person has gone to court and had their felony legally set aside or expunged then they can legally answer the question &#8216;have you been convicted of a felony&rsquo; as &#8220;no&#8221;. To do this someone has had to sucessfully completed parole and not reoffended for a number of years. The record is not totally gone and they will probably not get their second amendment rights back but they cannot be denied employment.</p>

		<p>And I&rsquo;m sure these felony convictions with blacks and hispanics are all white people&rsquo;s fault, huh?  Do blacks and hispanics ever admit they&rsquo;re responsible for their own shortcomings?  I&rsquo;m sick and tired of blacks, hispanics, and liberals telling employers, landlords, and everyone who they have to do business with.</p>

		<p>Racial discrimination is only illegitimate if it is based on race alone.  If it is based on something that varies with race, such as criminal record or performance on a mental aptitude test, it is not only acceptable, it is proper.  </p>

		<p>Not hiring felons also discriminates against thieves, rapists and drug addicts.  If you are running a business and want honest, reliable employees, this is generally a good thing.</p>

		<p>Ha!  Guess this lawsuit PROVES what we&rsquo;ve known all along - that the majority of felonies are committed by blacks and Hispanics!!  And if THIS lawsuit comes out in favor of the plaintiff, what&rsquo;s that going to do to the requirement for teachers in the public schools that they have no felonies???  Do we have to put ex-cons in our public schools to teach our kids?  What a bunch of bull.  White folks, HOMESCHOOL your kids - God alone knows what they&rsquo;re going to install as teachers in public schools in the future!!!</p>
