<h1>Does Religious Belief Make You More Racist?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sarah Estes Graham, Psychology Today, July 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} But new research suggests that religious belief can also make you more racist. A recent meta-analysis (considered the gold standard for evidence in the research world) synthesized numerous studies from the Civil Rights Era to the present, considering intrinsic, extrinsic, and quest/agnostic religiosity, and found positive correlations between religiosity and racism in all but the agnostic group.</p>
<p>Intrinsic, extrinsic, and agnostic, terms popularized by Harvard Psychologist Gordon Allport in the 1950&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s, are still widely used by social scientists conducting studies on religious belief and practice. Broadly defined, they correlate with fundamentalist and evangelical Christians (extrinsics), liberal Christians (intrinsics) and seekers or agnostics. Extrinsics prize social belonging and conformity to the status quo, and tend more toward right-wing authoritarianism. {snip} This is the group that provides the most fuel for red-state/blue-state, theist/atheist debates.</p>
<p>Intrinsics value the internal seeking relationship and tend toward more progressive social ideals. {snip} Agnostics are a bit further down the openness line, religious to the extent that they are open to existential questions but undecided to the point of affiliational lack. </p>
<p>The study found that both extrinsic and intrinsic believers showed more racial prejudice than those who were not religious. Extrinsics showed more racism in both explicit and implicit measures. Intrinsics stated that they were less racist on explicit self-report, but were equally biased on implicit measures (reaction-time tasks bypassing self-report, {snip}). Only the agnostics were less racist on both counts.</p>
<p>There are a number of caveats to be considered before you drop your church membership or go trolling for prejudice on the nearest Christian message board. As we all know, correlation does not equal causation. When considering the effects of priming studies, one must be aware that certain primes can activate or trigger entire clusters of values. {snip} The meta-analyzers themselves noted that when they controlled for authoritarianism, the correlation between racism and religiosity disappeared.</p>
<p>To get to the bottom of this causality question, an experiment was conducted at Baylor University (a Southern Christian University). This was the first study specifically designed to gauge the effects of religious primes on racial attitudes. The researchers subliminally primed different groups of participants with neutral and Christian primes, and found that the group receiving the religious primes showed a small but significant increase in prejudicial attitudes toward African Americans. It should be noted that the groups tested were predominantly white, Christian Americans. {snip}</p>

		<p> Some people stay in college far, far too long for their own good. Sarah Estes Graham appears to be one of them. She wouldn&rsquo;t recognize plain, simple English if she tripped over it on the street. Aside from the fact that she uses ten times too many words to babble on about her subject, she never tells us exactly what she means by &#8220;racism.&#8221; But then, leftists never do. Why &#8220;de-demonize&#8221; a perfectly serviceable hate-scare word by defining it?</p>
<p> As to the testing of the groups that were &#8220;predominantly White, Christian Americans,&#8221; we all know why the testers seem to have avoided non-Whites as subjects: Including them would muddy up the &#8220;All White people are racists and all racists are White people&#8221; waters that are such a cherished part of multi-culti ideology. </p>

		<p>This indeed is an utterly laughable &ldquo;study&rdquo;!</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The meta-analyzers themselves noted that when they controlled for authoritarianism, the correlation between racism and religiosity disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, it logically negates almost all of the speculative inferences about religiosity and &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; unless authoritarianism is not at the very least established as having a significant correlation with traditional Christianity. Which it apparently does not, since when controlled for, &ldquo;the correlation between racism and religiosity disappeared.&rdquo; Talk about chasing your tail and tearing it off.</p>
<p>Another good example, is the fact that the samples studied to &ldquo;establish&rdquo; these conclusions were: &ldquo;predominantly white, Christian Americans;&rdquo; and these were primarily drawn from the 1950s and 1960s &ldquo;research,&rdquo; that &ldquo;synthesized numerous studies from the Civil Rights Era to the present.&rdquo; </p>
<p>A lot has changed between 1950 and 2010, so how were these changes &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; for? How do they or not reflect, accentuate, or debilitate the correlations between the triad of: &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; authoritarianism, and religion, for example?</p>
<p>I could go on, but you should get my point already; attempting to establish relationships between  all this &ldquo;scholarly&rdquo; Marxist rubbish and &ldquo;racist&rdquo; political trends today, is absurd mental masturbation at best!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!<br>

		<p>Take a bunch of white Southern Christians, label their race realism as  &mdash;  gasp!  &mdash;  racism, and claim that religiousness equals race hatred.  That&rsquo;s basically what this study did.  And, of course, cultural leftists deny any differences in the races just like they deny the existence of God.</p>

		<p>Well, I for one an am atheist. I don&rsquo;t claim that there is no god however I lack belief in god simply because there is no evidence to support me holding a belief in such a being. I apply this same reasoning to race. The same reason I reject the theists claim of a god (due to their lack of any proof) is exactly why I reject the liberals claim that the races are equal or that race doesn&rsquo;t really exist. There is no evidence to support the egalitarian position and unlike the god argument, there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary. <br>
I can&rsquo;t speak for anybody else here but I would feel that atheists would tend to be more apt to simply side with the evidence on race than a theist for by being a theist, one has already proven that they will believe what appeals to them over what the evidence actually supports and that is exactly what is required in order to be an egalitarian. </p>

		<p>Devout mainline Protestants and Roman Catholics are among the biggest pushers of diversity around.  Two more treasonous groups can not be found.  And the three major Jewish congrgations push for diversity everywhere but there own Synagoues.  So it seems Western religions only make you racist against whites.</p>

<p>For once (and with no hard feelings), I must disagree with you, dear oldwhitelady!  We seem to be on opposite sides here.  I am unaware of the provable existence of any god,  gods, or goddesses  (or other divine beings) flying about in the sky.   But I am very well aware of the provable existence of other races walking about here on earth   &mdash;   some of which are distinctly hostile to us.  It is those earthly races that concern me more than the gods, saints, or angels in the heavens. </p>
<p>I need not go on because I think Robert stated the case very well, so I&rsquo;ll leave it with him.  And, let me add, I mean no disrespect to you or any of our good believers&hellip; (which would include much of my own family).</p>

<p>Just guessing here, WE, but I would speculate that she is &#8220;black&#8221; (to whatever degree that means).  Few white Americans use these longish, pompous names   &mdash;   but blacks do, just as do West Indians. They seem to feel that the more names they can squeeze in, the more important they sound. And her facility with the language, which you mention, further confirms that suspicion. (As well as her obsession with the subject of &#8220;racism&#8221;.)   As I said, just guessing. But I&rsquo;m generally pretty good at it.</p>

		<p>Sorry this is a bit long; this is my first post on this site.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an atheist too, Robert. It was actually the reaffirming of my atheism that lead me down the road to embracing HBD. When you learn how to spot logical fallacies from arguing with Christians (or any religion for that matter) you also begin to spot them more easily on questions of race (such as the egalitarian assumptions most people have). I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb here and guess that many HBD-aware people value Judeo-Christian beliefs (and are thus believers themselves) because of the eugenic qualities inherent in such traditions. Perhaps non-HBD people are subconsciously aware that such faiths and traditions are eugenic and value religion for that rather the commonly cited &#8220;fear of death.&#8221; (Now in keep in mind I&rsquo;m only talking about Judaism and Christianity; certainly not Islam.) However, I still cannot believe something that I don&rsquo;t find to be true. To paraphrase Bertrand Russell, you should believe something because you think it&rsquo;s true based on the evidence or not believe. I also agree with people like Christopher Hitchens when they say &#8220;we need to outgrow this foolishness&#8221; which of course brings to mind the interesting &#8220;God is dead&#8221; philsophical question Nietzsche posed that so many people seem to misinterpret. But I&rsquo;m wondering too far off topic here as it is. Certainly one only needs to look at some of the comments made by African/ME Muslim immigrants in Scandinavia (e.g. &#8220;white whores&#8221;) to know that some religions reinforce racist attittudes. I don&rsquo;t think many of us need a study done to know what the nonwhite crowd (religious or not) thinks about the white race. At any rate, discovering HBD (maybe I should write &#8220;rediscovering&#8221;) has actually given me an appreciation for not just Western civilization, but Christianity as well. Even though I cannot bring myself to believe, I have some sympathies for church-goers that I did not have before due to my HBD awareness. That being said, I can certainly do without the in your face &#8220;fire and brimstone&#8221; Christian crowd. Because religion can be abused so easily by its very nature, I&rsquo;m always a bit uneasy about it in general. Theological discussions, though, are always fun. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a fundamentalist Christian and a race realist.  The Bible even tells you that the descendants of Canaan are cursed; that&rsquo;s why blacks are the way they are.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hate blacks, but I certainly am not fond of their behavior  &mdash;  their &#8220;look at me&#8221; and entitlement attitudes.</p>
<p>I believe that God separated us by language (Tower of Babel), by race (sons of Noah), and land (in the days of Peleg was the earth divided  &mdash;  I believe this refers to Pangaea).</p>

		<p>Well, I suppose if Judeo-Christian religion (and the Ten Commandments) demands moral behavior from its believers, it could follow that those adherents disapprove of typical black behavior, such as extreme promiscuity, bearing false witness, thievery, a hugely elevated murder rate, sloth, indolence, and generally violent behavior.  While not all blacks conduct their lives irresponsibly, the undeniable fact is that many of them do, far more than people of any other race or ethnicity.</p>
<p>Noting these dismal facts does not one a racist make, but those who deny them are fools, liars, or willfully ignorant.  And the deniers, however strident their denials, are usually the first to put as much distance as possible between themselves and their black &#8220;brethren,&#8221; all the while stridently scolding the rest of us for our &#8220;racist&#8221; views.</p>

		<p>The two least understood and most mis-applied statements in our culture are the following (1) All men are created equal, and (2) we are all one in Christ.  The first deals ONLY with the concept that all men were created by God and have only the following equality with each other - the right to life and equal standing under the law.  Period.<br>
The second deals only with an extension of the first:  that being all men being created by God, Christ (who is God incarnate) will accept every sinner who comes to him with true repentance. Period.  Liberals, half-way house Christians, lying pastors or priests, and other deluded folks pervert those two statements to mean there are NO differences between people and races.  God MADE those difference.  They conveniently overlook that.  So in law, we must prosecute equal numbers of racial criminals disregarding that one race commits most crimes.  In schools we must graduate the races equally, despite the fact that one race above all others is less intelligent and less willing to do the work.  In churches loving one another and the &#8220;all one in Christ&#8221; thing has been pushed to encourage race MIXING.  Prior to the 1950&rsquo;s people KNEW the context of the two statements.  They also knew the whole bible, not a convenient few phrases.  And they knew the Constitution and what it really meant, what it allowed, and what it forbid.  Blame public schools for people losing the meaning and context of both the Constitutional Republic and the Bible.<br>
BOTH were taught in public schools once upon a time.  Now they are not.</p>

		<p>As a Christian, I would say that that my faith does affirm the significance of race. After all, if it was God who created the races, then surely it is gross presumption of man to mar that creation by mixing and blending it.</p>
<p>Frankly, it seems to me that evolution is more consistent with indifference to race. If evolution is true, race is just one of so many other biologial accidents in the course of ceaseless change. Perhaps in time evolution could end human races  &mdash;  and indeed the human race  &mdash;  by turning us into something totally nonhuman. With evolution, we could become as different from what we are now as from the amoebas we once were.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Does Religious Belief Make You More Racist?&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
It certainly seems to with the Muslims: they&rsquo;re quite racist against us white people and any other Unbelievers. </p>
<p>But with 21st Century Christians, it seems to have the opposite effect: the gooey brand of Jesus-as-Hippie-Flower-Child that our churches have been preaching for the past four deaces (with disastrous social consequences) actively promotes ANTI-racism, Diversity, Multiculturalism, Cultural Equivalence, and Open Borders. (All things which, quite properly, belong outside of Religion&rsquo;s domain altogether!) Postmodern X&rsquo;ianity is Jesus&rsquo; concept of infinite mercy run amok   &mdash;   to the point of masochism. It is an orgy of insupportable altruism (&#8220;Feed the Third World   &mdash;   even if it means starving ourselves!&#8221;) that actually values and privileges hateful strangers from the other side of the globe, over itself. </p>
<p>But then, I <i>would</i> say bigoted, backward, intolerant stuff like that, wouldn&rsquo;t I? I&rsquo;m one of those &#8220;white Christian Americans&#8221; that Psychology Today warned you about. <br>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t seem to be true at all. Couldn&rsquo;t have this study if they Really felt that race did not exist? Their whole ideology is founded on race. Race just isn&rsquo;t supposed to exist for white people. And that seems to be just the way it works. </p>

<p>So what you&rsquo;re telling me is that a group of people that refuses to say yes or no on God is also non-committal on issues of race?  Or in other words, people who don&rsquo;t stand for anything, don&rsquo;t stand for anything?</p>
<p>Frankly I&rsquo;d rather live next door to King Shabazz than a spineless white who can&rsquo;t decide if there&rsquo;s a God or not and refuses to accept that which is extremely obvious when it comes to race.<br>

 I suppose if Judeo-Christian religion demands moral behavior from its believers, it could follow that those adherents disapprove of typical black behavior, such as extreme promiscuity, bearing false witness, thievery, a hugely elevated murder rate, sloth, indolence, and generally violent behavior. <br>
While not all blacks conduct their lives irresponsibly, the undeniable fact is that many of them do, far more than people of any other race or ethnicity.<br>

<p>But the contradiction is that blacks comprise the MOST religious (and the most ignorant) element of the population.  How do you explain that?   </p>
<p>As for their religion demanding moral behavior   &mdash;   thievery, promiscuity, and all the rest   &mdash;   it is often black preachers who are notorious for exactly this sort of thing. But that doesn&rsquo;t dampen the devotion of their gullible  congregations.</p>
<p>PS. And why only condemn &#8220;EXTREME promiscuity&#8221;? That seems strange! Where do you draw the reasonable limit? How much is acceptable? </p>

<p><b>&#8220;found positive correlations between religiosity and racism in all but the agnostic group.&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>Well, she is simply WRONG about that (as  she is  about so much); and I and other non-religious persons posting here are the proof of it!</p>
<p><b>So what you&rsquo;re telling me is that a group of people that refuses to say yes or no on God is also non-committal on issues of race? Or in other words, people who don&rsquo;t stand for anything, don&rsquo;t stand for anything?

<p>Well then, you won&rsquo;t want to move next to me. (Sorry not to have you.)  I would reason it the other way, however. You are implying that we simply don&rsquo;t know any better and have never given serious matters any thought.  That facile assumption  is absolutely wrong.  To the contrary, people who have given THOUGHT to such matters  and  who have made up their own minds are far more likely to come to  unorthodox conclusions that differ with the fashionable notions of the day.    Meanwhile, people who simply accept whatever is the standard point of view, without ever questioning it, are far more likely to  be supporters of  both integration and religion.  These points of view change with the times, and what people think today isn&rsquo;t the same as what they thought 50 years ago. But most people just accept whatever  they&rsquo;re told  by those in authority and don&rsquo;t dare rock the boat. Few people really do any thinking of their own.  Independent thinking  is a socially dangerous thing. It&rsquo;s always dangerous to be different.  It is difficult and often costly to stand up for your own beliefs. That is not what you contemptuously  call &#8220;spineless&#8221;.  Going along with the herd is what I call spineless.</p>
<p>As for atheists/agnostics &hellip; doesn&rsquo;t it seem that people who are willing to question the currently conformist beliefs on religion would also be more  willing to question the currently conformist beliefs on race?  Face it:  It is much easier to just go along with the herd  and conform with the crowd than to stand up for your own  independent beliefs, when that is an unpopular and risky  thing to do. </p>
<p>We have had comments above from posters who vary widely  from  atheists to fundamentalist Christians. I think we have learned from these  comments that there is no automatic correlation  of religion with racial thinking.<br>

		<p>I might be termed agnostic, but I would like to assure the poor, brainwashed author of this little piece of Freudian drivel that I am as &#8220;racist&#8221; as it is possible to be.</p>
<p>The fact that modern psychology is terminally infected with leftist ideology is self-evident with the fact that &#8220;Right-Wing Authoritarianism&#8221; is classified as sort of a quasi-mental illness, but there is no corresponding classification for delusional leftists. The &#8220;Social sciences&#8221; are simply Frankfurt-school Cultural Marxism dressed up and pretending to be a legitimate science. </p>
<p>re:Wasn&rsquo;t Racist Until They Made Me<br>
You should consider that some people may be agnostics because they don&rsquo;t believe they have enough evidence to rationally accept the doctrines of a religion OR to reject the idea of God entirely. It is not a matter of commitment or lack thereof, it is a matter of cautious and careful reasoning. </p>

		<p>We do live in interesting times.</p>
<p>Traditional morals are on the decline (family, marriage, politeness, respectable gender roles), and the European-Caucasian race are dwindling in numbers. Worldwide, more of our people are dying than being born. In just a generation or so, there is projected to be about twice as many White senior citizens than White minors. We are a graying and stagnant race with one foot in the grave it seems. I guess that can be blamed on a lot of things - proliferated acceptance of divorce, delayed child-bearing, the promoted idea that &#8220;children hold a woman back from true happiness and a career&#8221;. There are several other factors.</p>
<p>In all White nations, there has been many social, cultural, and political changes in the last half-century. The majority of them were not in the best interests of our people&rsquo;s happiness and survival. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but where I live in California, it&rsquo;s a treat to see a white couple with two+ young children. For the dark races, it&rsquo;s a given all the time.</p>
<p>Waking up to, and studying about race realism has made me more of a spiritual person. When I was more agnostic, I didn&rsquo;t really give much thought to the racial issue. As I began to notice/learn more things about the 3 major races of the world, it has given me more faith in a personal God. A God that is incomprehensible, creative, and loving.  It is clear just by your own senses that God has blessed EuroCaucasian mankind in ways he didn&rsquo;t other races. In creativity, endurance, aptitude, and faith. Inferior or Superior is irrelative. It is obvious to me God loves variety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each to their own kind, male and female&#8221;. </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it pretty obvious, if we were meant to mix genetically, I would assume he wouldn&rsquo;t have made us the different races.<br>
Even Asian coutries like Japan, China, and N/S Korea believe that way. Just about all races/ethnic groups believe that way except for brainwashed Whites.</p>
<p>I do think the decline of White values, culture, and genetics is one of the signs of The Last of Days.</p>

<p>You are contradicting yourself here.  And if God truly loved &#8220;EuroCaucasian mankind&#8221;, then why would He permit it to<br>
be [in your own words] &#8220;a graying and stagnant race with one foot in the grave&#8221;? (How pessimistic!)  Where is that divine love?</p>

<p>Yes, they do. They know better, instinctually.  And without any god telling them to do so. On the other hand,  white Christians are constantly admonished about their obligation to love all mankind &hellip;and to feed them, clothe them, medicate them, educate them, and even take them in to live among us. Since when did responsibility for mankind and immigration become fundamental tenets of Christianity???</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s pretty obvious to me!</p>
