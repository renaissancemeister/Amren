	<p>Jared Taylor debates Adam Lerman of By Any Means Necessary on the nature of racial preferences. The springboard for the discussion was Sen.

		<p>lol The host gave Adam Lerman a tough question and instead of leaving him on the hot seat to answer it Jared jumped in to &#8216;answer&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m surprised Jared didn&rsquo;t do better. He usually embarrasses those foolish enough to debate him. </p>

		<p>When the guy said &#8216;there are only 100 blacks&rsquo; or whatever at Howard U, Jared should have said something like, &#8216;why are there only 4 white bus drivers (for LA metro transit)&rsquo; - where they are proud of doing all the can for &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. Or why is LA now 30% white or whatever, and no whites in some neighborhoods - the very ones filled with folks who &#8216;say&rsquo; they want diversity. It would show how callous these &#8216;diversity&rsquo; people really are, I think.</p>

<p>A dose of race realism for the disbelievers.  Lerman couldn&rsquo;t hold a candle to Jared Taylor.  We need a few hundred Jared Taylors to communicate this message.  We&rsquo;re the ones who should have a motto of &#8220;By any means necessary&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Here is something to think about. If Native Born White Americans ever become a racial minority, high fertility post-1965 nonwhites will have the power to force affirmative action on Native Born White Americans permanently-and there will be nothing Native Born White Americans can do about it. If  and when high fertility post-1965 nonwhites become the majority in the military and police forces across the &#8220;America&#8221;, they will have the power to do anything they want to us. Do you want to take the risk? This is what Jared and everybody else here should be telling their fellow Native born White Americans.</p>
<p>It would be  complete act of insanity for Native Born White Americans to put their fate in the hands of a high fertility and hostile post-1965 nonwhite majority.</p>

		<p>I thought Mr Taylor did his usual superior job. It&rsquo;s interesting how tortured the logic was of his opponent. He had no ability to fathom how silly his ideas sounded. Now that wouldn&rsquo;t be too bad if it were a college sophomore coming out with those statements, but that was no college sophomore Mr. Taylor was debating. He was a fully grown man. Not good.</p>
<p>Also, of course, I thought the moderator was trying her best to dilute what Mr Taylor was saying. Not successfully though in my book.  </p>
<p>Another point is that just a year ago, these debates were never put on TV. Now they are. People are awakening to what&rsquo;s going on now and I think these pro minority forces understand full well that their time is coming to a close.</p>

		<p>Well, another win for Mr. Taylor (and what else would you expect) at the expense of two befuddled and fecklessly wretched Reds!</p>
<p>Look, affirmative action is nothing more than reverse Apartheid against our white majority in the USA; mass Third World &ldquo;immigration&rdquo; is the exact same thing, since it seeks to impose nonwhite dominance on that which was built and maintained by and for that white majority. The laughable aspect of this being that nonwhites, particularly Hispanics and blacks, get frustrated when even &ldquo;Nirvana&rdquo; has been achieved and whitey is a minority (as they and their Red enablers have so long yearned for) in a place like California and they don&rsquo;t just magically gain &ldquo;equality&rdquo; with, or what they really want,  supremacy over him. Moreover, as the &ldquo;Eurocentric nightmare&rdquo; descends into diversity&rsquo;s tranquility, things just seem to get worse: bankruptcy, unemployment, escalating crime, and general squalor, just to name a few, become the norm.</p>
<p>Why might that be?</p>
<p>Because of &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; is the official answer, but we all know different!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>All Lerman does here is provide facts about racial inequality that do indeed exist. Both sides agree they exist so that fact can be put aside. The real difference here is that one side is for fairness and judging people on their individual merits and the other side is for forced equality and racial discrimination at the expense of whites. It&rsquo;s so easy to see which position has merit and which one does not. </p>
<p>The liberal position has no concern at all with fairness, all they want care about is their equality pipe dream. It&rsquo;s a delusional idealist fantasy that will never come true in a society based upon fairness and competition any more than it will in the NBA. Racial equality can not be achieved because the races are not equal. A reality that a liberal like Lerman stubbornly refuses to accept.</p>
<p>We need to speak out about this bait and switch tactic the liberals are now engaging in as Lerman did in this interview. The issue here is not even about racial equality, it&rsquo;s about giving everybody equal opportunity no matter what their race gender or sexual orientation is. Equality is absolutely irrelevant. Plus, where does the equality dogma end, with some type of communism where we all get the very same pay no matter what we do?</p>

		<p>A second point now: I love the part at 6:38 where Comrade Lerman mentions the city of Detroit and follows it up with a crack about East LA. Mr. Taylor was at his best here, and if you watch the oops I just had a liquid gas burst in my pants look on Comrade Lerman&rsquo;s face, you know this to be the truth. Mr. Taylor quite correctly points out that these are not just struggling diversity enclaves, but totally nonwhite dominated areas that should be unhindered successes. Yet, they wallow in poverty, corruption, and crime, with the only excuse being offered that it is &ldquo;endemic racism&rdquo; that perpetuates this.</p>
<p>As Mr. Taylor observers, when will these children of the Third World simply &ldquo;grow up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer is never, because the truth of the situation would be too bitter a pill to swallow. This video clearly demonstrates that, both in terms of enraptured paranoia and self-satisfied hatred:</p>

<p>Latinos can&rsquo;t compete without affirmative action = racism.<br>
Detroit, ran by blacks, is a violent ghetto = racism.<br>
Any achievement gap = racism.</p>
<p>The sky is racist, Tea Parties are racist, insurance rates are racist, the Internet is racist, IQ tests are racist&hellip;</p>

		<p>Mr. Taylor,<br>
You are a patient man.  I endured the homeless pre-segment on Hawaii and the insipid mediators &#8216;input&rsquo; twice.  I find it interesting that the non-atheltic scholarship based enrollment at UCLA for tinged citizens is less than 100.  This coupled with the demographic analysis of the Los(t) Angeles basin and the related disenfranchisement with formal (including secondary) education to be&hellip;typical.  I am turly impressed that you consistently maintain a persistent rational and logical reaction when responding to attack.<br>
  &mdash;  But then again you are white.<br>

		<p>Mr. Taylor was obviously the pragmatic grown-up in the room.</p>
<p>If black and hispanic teens would buckle down and study and prepare for college, instead of being slothful, insolent, and &#8220;victimized&#8221;, we would see more minorities succeeding in higher education. However, we all know that they won&rsquo;t. The pleasures of cruising in the hood and being down with their homies is more appealing.</p>
<p>How terribly sad for them: they are apparently content to wave their victim banners in perpetuity. </p>

<p>As far as affirmative action goes, I can&rsquo;t see how people think that purposefully discriminating against white people in the favor of black and Hispanics will make racism go away. It only makes white people resent black and Hispanics and creates racism.</p>

		<p>This was a great example of atavism on the part of Marcus e.g referring to the receptionist and the interviewer as &#8220;B  &mdash;  ch&#8221; and the lapse into Ghettoese. </p>
<p>The typical White stereotypes were also represented with the Blonde receptionist&rsquo;s absurd questioning and her less than subtle flirtation with the Black candidate and of course the unrealistic statements by the interviewer. Only Joe Biden would be clueless enough to make such a statement.</p>

		<p>I agree with the poster above who says people are waking up.  I am sensing it. Everybody in this movement is sensing it, except for the pessimists who post on this website.</p>
<p>Somebody asked who will carry the torch when Mr. Taylor is gone.  Well, there are many people involved in this cause other than Mr. Taylor.  Branch out and read other websites.  Look at the &#8220;links&#8221; section here on Amren and you will see what I mean. Do your own searches on the internet (some people have their own radio shows).  Send me an email and I will list you the many websites (organizations) that work for our cause.</p>
<p>Lastly, Taurus689 and Cid, which video did you watch?  It doesn&rsquo;t sound like the one I watched.  In the one I watched, the white people did just fine, save the liberal Russian female host to the show (who was tan in complexion and dark haired).</p>
<p>By the way, the count for views on this video has doubled since last night.  Post this video on different websites.  Get a Youtube account and comment on this video and rate it highly.  Also, rate the comments highly that are on our side.  This will do more good than you think.</p>

		<p>The problem is that these left wing liberals cannot say racist properly as it is spelled R-E-A-L-I-S-T.  So I am proud to be a realist and nowadays seem to win when discussing the subject with strangers, but many more now are agreeing with me so we must keep the fight going.</p>

A dose of race realism for the disbelievers. Lerman couldn&rsquo;t hold a candle to Jared Taylor. We need a few hundred Jared Taylors to communicate this message. We&rsquo;re the ones who should have a motto of &ldquo;By any means necessary&rdquo;.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean a thing if you win the battle and lose the war.  It may even be a bad (negative psychology) condition which enforces white&rsquo;s subconscious, self-congratulatory, sense of themselves as &#8216;being right&rsquo; without having to commit to anything as a deliberate act of choosing sides.</p>
<p>@8,<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
All Lerman does here is provide facts about racial inequality that do indeed exist. Both sides agree they exist so that fact can be put aside. The real difference here is that one side is for fairness and judging people on their individual merits and the other side is for forced equality and racial discrimination at the expense of whites. It&rsquo;s so easy to see which position has merit and which one does not.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which is why this video is, ultimately, pointless.  First, as soon as Taylor brought up a _racial genetics linked argument_ for why and where blacks succeed at the cost of white expense, the conversation was immediately shifted elsewhere.  Until and unless you can EFFECTIVELY say: &#8220;Whites are smarter than blacks by a full Mean Standard Deviation and almost 10 points smarter than hispanics and THAT is why we do better at advanced education and with that education in our standard of achievements.&#8221; you will never get anywhere.  Of course the easiest way to say this is simple: &#8220;Asians at 106 and Jews at 112-116 are just as high above us, on average&hellip;&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my second point.  Whites SHOULD be able to say: &#8220;This is a nation for us.  This is a land where the standard of benefit is higher for us -because- we take care of our own.&#8221;  As soon as you can say that and not feel guilty about someone else who doesn&rsquo;t get as much because -their segment of society- is not as numerous or genetically as socially endowed, you have a fighting position to work from.  Anything less than this and you have to justify &#8216;what is fair&rsquo;.  Which can be interpreted far too many ways.  Prejudice is good because it is the glue which holds certain population groups together in a way that makes them more successful as societies.  Forget this and you will be bypassed by those groups that refuse to give up that leverage.  Live with it and you&rsquo;d bette be willing to _vote down_, by democratic majority, those whose moral conscience exceeds their natural understanding that we are indeed, separate, sub races.</p>
<p>@12,<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
Jared was right in every statement. What makes me upset is, how come the liberals in this country can not see what is going on right in front of their eyes? <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t Hitler make &#8216;the grand sacrifice&rsquo; for Germany in 1944 when there was still something to be saved?  If they are wrong and we are right, then civil rights activists have to face up to a crime against humanity which may well end up being -worse- than whatever was done to the Jews in wartime occupied Europe.  Indeed, at this point, the numeric trends are so vastly biased towards white replacement that their only hope is to act as good little Quislings and &#8216;hope it all works out in the end&rsquo; because, short of race war, they are about to become part of the minority and only through the _zealousness_ of their facilitation and enablement can they possiby hope to achieve some kind of recognition from their new masters.  As they certainly never will from us.</p>

If black and hispanic teens would buckle down and study and prepare for college, instead of being slothful, insolent, and &ldquo;victimized&rdquo;, we would see more minorities succeeding in higher education. However, we all know that they won&rsquo;t. The pleasures of cruising in the hood and being down with their homies is more appealing.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>This was where Mr. Taylor was headed I think before the easy slam dunk of Detroit and LA were proffered up.  Because the fact is that most hispanics don&rsquo;t make it to an HSD at the same time hispanic teen illegitimate pregnancy levels now rival if not exceed -inner city- black numbers (in the 60% range).  If they never make it out of high school, they aren&rsquo;t gonna show up on College Campus&rsquo;.  And by creating a &#8216;service economy&rsquo; where huge numbers of unskilled laborers can get an early edge by learning to swing a hammer onto a nail, it may well be an effective strategy.  It certainly pumps up the youth cohorts (shortening the effective generational intervals) and pushing a LOT of voters into the ranks in huge waves.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:<br>
As long as the media has ultimate control over the -way- these &#8216;debates&rsquo; are presented, as entertaining sidelines that do nothing to stop the progress of ethnic nullification of European cultural amalgamation of power, the sheer politeness of the discourse will serve to keep whites from believing &#8216;really, it is happening&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And that is why, now that it is too late to do much to stop it, you are starting to see a little realism in the debates.  Because, like a nuclear reactor, it is better to &#8216;moderate&rsquo; a release of angst with a graphite control rod immediately to hand, than it is to accept an explosion of induced critical mass reactionary hatred to the continual lies about race.</p>
<p>We could stop this, now, if we resorted to some fairly draconian means.  But those that push OWG by any means, -must- neutralize the racially unified, ethnically shared belief system which nations represent.  They must destroy what they cannot equal to replace it.</p>
<p>And as long as people are afraid to say: &#8220;You know, I _like_ our way of thinking&hellip;  I _like_ the look and commonality of our faces and our attitudes.  I want that to perpetuate as a powerful expression of racial identity rather than be islanded or miscegenated as my _chosen_ gift to our children&rsquo;s future.&#8221;</p>
<p>We will continue to be mentally manipulated by concepts of &#8216;fairness&rsquo; which can always be made to seem more appropriate in an idealized sense.  But which make no accomodation of the details of racial differences in key areas of group behavior, survival psychology and sheer ability to participate in societies not designed for their success model.</p>
<p>I say this as much about Asians and Jews (superior intelligence group thinkers who have lost the individualist/meritocratic ability to pioneer new ideas) as I do Blacks and Hispanics (inferior intelligence, superior group accomodators whose collective actions).</p>

 &#8220;If Native Born White Americans ever become a racial minority, high fertility post-1965 nonwhites will have the power to force affirmative action on NBWAs permanently   &mdash;   and there will be nothing NBWAs  can do about it. If and when high fertility post-1965 nonwhites become the majority in the military and police forces across the &ldquo;America&rdquo;, they will have the power to do anything they want to us. &#8220;<br>
  &mdash;   JUPTER<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>That is a looming possibility which may force some re-thinking. It may be that we shall need to learn to see ourselves and our situation in the world through new eyes, through a fresh lens.  We may need to re-evaluate our political system   &mdash;  - while we can.  Nothing is set in stone!!! We are co committed to the comcept of one-person-one-vote, that it is hard even to question it. It is the foundation stone of our national political philosophy.  But as a matter of fact, the concept of majority rule is a very recent, and very western, notion in the world.   In historical terms, it is  still very new and very radical. It is utterly alien to most cultures. In the past, and almost everywhere, nearly all societies were ruled by very tiny minorities.  </p>
<p>I am a believer in democratic values and our democratic tradition, which have served us well for the first two centuries, when we were the dominant population in the country that we created  &#8220;for ourselves and our posterity&#8221;.    But we are coming to a new time and a new demographic situation that has been IMPOSED upon us.  What suited us best in 1783 may no longer serve us well in 2033.  Every system is tailored to suit its time and place. But situations can change.  There may come a time when democratic rule   &mdash;   majority rule   &mdash;   will no longer serve us well.  For examples, just look at Zimbabwe and South Africa today.  This is something to start thinking about.  </p>
<p>Democracy is the classic case of two wolves and one sheep taking a vote on what to have for dinner.  There comes a point where majority rule is NOT  ALWAYS in everybody&rsquo;s best interest!  Is the sheep going to be  neutral and &#8220;fair&#8221; and let the wolves have their way (because that&rsquo;s the democratic thing to do)?  Or is the sheep going to do what is good for the sheep?</p>

<p>Affirmative action was forced on the Whites of America by native born White male Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon and about 20 White male native born American Judges.  By 1972 the damage was done.  It took a mere 8 years.  It will never end.  </p>

		<p>What got me was that AA guy whining about the racial make-up of California universities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not flat-out discrimination, Comrade Lerner.  The thing is, we are not all equal.</p>
<p>Right after high school, for example, I enrolled in a 24-week vocational course.  I was the ONLY white student there at the time I enrolled  &mdash;  everyone else was black.  I was also told that I was the first one to achieve a straight-A (3.9) average in the course.  If I&rsquo;d done slightly better in math (something that males tend to do better in!), it would have been a 4.0.</p>
<p>I also got tired of hearing about &#8220;socioeconomic barriers.&#8221;  Come off it, lady.  You can&rsquo;t expect someone with an IQ of 75 to be a rocket scientist!</p>

		<p>The ultimate problem for all of us is that when the underclass gets power it is not as if the public virtues flourish. Lerman, like many Marxists, is in it for the thrill chaos brings, followed -they hope- by the elixir of unchecked power. However, I have come to the conclusion that contemporary Marxists are incapable of learning; the most obvious lesson of twentieth century politics being that Marxism does not work. Sooner or later any society not in love with grinding poverty opts out of the Marxist model.<br>
A rich society cannot be made up of poor citizens, equal in their poverty or not. </p>

		<p>Jared Taylor should have drawn more attention to differences in average performance levels between whites and blacks.   Before the civil rights legislation was passed most advocates of that legislation believed that once blacks were no longer discriminated against they would quickly be able to perform at white levels.<br>
 <br>
By the early 1970&rsquo;s it was obvious that ending racial discrimination would not end racial inequality.  It is still dangerous to explain why, but whites should not feel guilty about the reasons.  </p>
