<h1>Oak Brook Hotel Backs Out on Muslim Group&rsquo;s Conference</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Manya A. Brachear, Chicago Tribune, July 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The controversial American arm of an international Islamic group has been bounced from the Marriott in Oak Brook, where organizers were set to host the group&rsquo;s second annual conference this Sunday.</p>
<p>Organizers of Hizb ut-Tahrir, Muslim activists who publicly advocate peaceful government reform, hope to find another venue for their meeting before the end of July.</p>
<p>Critics believe the conference, dedicated to reviving the prevailing system of rule that immediately followed the death of the Prophet Muhammad, is an effort to turn American Muslims against the U.S. government.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not attacking or bringing anybody down or humiliating,&#8221; said Ayman Hamed, a conference organizer who lives in Chicago Ridge. &#8220;It&rsquo;s just not about that. We&rsquo;re talking about Islam the way it should be understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>But a Washington-based interest group called Responsible for Equality and Liberty, or REAL, said that although Hizb ut-Tahrir explicitly condemns violence, its ideology suggests otherwise. Speakers at previous conferences have denounced democracy and condoned the death penalty for people who leave Islam, said the interest group&rsquo;s founder, Jeffrey Imm. He said he contacted the Marriott corporation last month when he saw the conference on the Oak Brook hotel&rsquo;s calendar.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to educate (the Marriott) about (Hizb ut-Tahrir&rsquo;s) anti-democracy position,&#8221; Imm said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m not looking to have their event canceled. I wanted them to be aware of who they are so they could have the appropriate security. These hotels have a right to know when there are groups that have been involved with or threaten violence against other people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hamed said the group signed a contract with the hotel in mid-May that explicitly stated the hotel could not cancel unless there was a catastrophic event or it was discovered that conference participants would engage in illegal or criminal activity. A month later, Hamed said he received an e-mail telling him the conference could not be held at the hotel. He later received a letter and refund check in the mail, he said.</p>
<p>{snip} Hamed said his group had been transparent with hotel management since a Muslim school in Bridgeview backed out of hosting the conference last year. He thinks venues should know whether protesters will show up on their doorstep, which happened last summer when the group moved its meeting to the Hilton in Oak Lawn.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He argues that the group&rsquo;s intentions are widely misunderstood. The group has no interest in overthrowing the U.S. government, he said. In fact, Hizb ut-Tahrir is banned in some Muslim countries because those are the very governments they want to replace with an Islamic republic or caliphate, the first system of governance established in Islam.</p>
<p>That system includes a penal code that, under certain circumstances, imposes the death penalty for leaving Islam  &mdash;  a point of contention for critics. But Hamed said it is not up to him to question the rules of a caliphate, which he believes come &#8220;from the creator, God.&#8221; It also would have no bearing in the U.S., he said.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see what the big deal is about apostates being executed as long as they believe it should be done within the framework of the existing law. There are plenty of folks that think child rapists should be executed, as long as they don&rsquo;t practice vigilante justice they have the right to their opinions.</p>

		<p>What a great country we live in.  Anyone who feels a sense of indignation about something can effectively dissolve a legal contract.</p>
<p>By all rights Marriott should be sued.</p>

		<p>Oh, oh!  Here&rsquo;s that fanatic Jeff Imm again   &mdash;   fighting for Freedom and Democracy by abrogating other peoples&rsquo; freedoms to speak and assemble.</p>
<p>While I have no sympathy at all (beyond a theoretical one)  for this group he&rsquo;s now attacking, it will be very interesting to see what support THEY get from Obama&rsquo;s and Eric Holder&rsquo;s Dept. of Justice.   This could be interesting.</p>
<p>An additional thought is that Mr. Imm has perhaps become spoiled in dealing with such a polite, non-violent group as Amren.  Amren was easy! A snap.   Moslems, on the other hand, do not hesitate to engage in beheadings, bombings, and such&hellip; when they feel the will of Allah has been thwarted. Mr. Imm had better hang on to his head tightly. He might have bitten off more than he can chew.</p>

		<p>Great. Freedom loving Americans who are concerned with the fate of the majority have been reduced to the equivalent of foreign Muslim terrorists. </p>

		<p>These folks are not moderate. In Denmark they have run into trouble for passing out literature advocating the murder of Jews. I think that makes them different enough from Amren to make it reasonable that they be treated differently. </p>

		<p>C - the problem is that Amren was treated the SAME as this group.  Imm and those like him lump US in with overt terrorists and groups that advocate the overthrow of the government, or the overthrow of Constitutional law.  We advocate just the opposite - a RETURN to a Constitutional Republic and a RETURN to Constitutional law.  Pretty much gives away the real agenda of Imm and company, doesn&rsquo;t it?  If ya ain&rsquo;t for Marxism, ya ain&rsquo;t welcome, and they view ANYBODY who isn&rsquo;t for relative morality, socialist tyranny, Big Government Handouts (tea party) etc as &#8220;terrorists&#8221; and &#8220;racist&#8221; so deny freedom of assembly and freedom of speech to any who disagree with their agenda.  That&rsquo;s the problem with tyranny - if you allow the abrogation of freedom of speech and assembly for one group - however repugnant - it always gets applied to YOUR group eventually.<br>
So what am I saying?  I despise groups like MoveOn.org, NAACP, Islam in general, etc which is the very reason I MUST guard against letting my personal view enable a tyrannical unconstitutional abrogation of their rights as long as they commit nor endorse criminal activity within our laws.</p>

Did I read this correctly?   <br>
Surely something must have been left out.<br>
