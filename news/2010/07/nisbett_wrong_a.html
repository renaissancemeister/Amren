<h1>Nisbett Wrong, Again  &mdash;  No Black Gains in Reading and Mathematics Over Five Decades</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>J. Philippe Rushton, VDARE, July 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now I want to focus these allegedly improving Black scores in more detail. This article too is based on an academic journal essay by Arthur Jensen and myself: in the March 2010 issue of Intelligence, The rise and fall of the Flynn Effect as a reason to expect a narrowing of the Black-White IQ gap.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, our new analysis finds that from 1954 to 2008 Black 17-year-olds consistently scored at the level of White 14-year-olds on tests of mathematics and reading  &mdash;  i.e. in more than fifty years, there had been no significant change at all.</p>
<p>As I will explain below, a 3+ year gap between Blacks and Whites at age 17 is equal to an IQ for Black 17-year-olds of about 85, the same as that found using standardized IQ tests.</p>
<p>Jensen and I began our analysis with the 1975 to 2008 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) long term assessment tests. These are often referred to as &#8220;The Nation&rsquo;s Report Card&#8221; because they are based on nationally representative samples of over 26,000 students. They comprise the gold standard for educational achievement tests, provide the empirical basis for No Child Left Behind. They assess Mathematics and Reading skills every three or four years for White, Black, and Hispanic 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>NAEP press releases regularly trumpet improvement i.e. closing the &#8220;Achievement Gap&#8221; in this or that subset of the Black population using this or that subtest. Our more pessimistic conclusions arise because we aggregated the data and looked at the entire period.</p>
<p>This 3+ year education gap between Blacks and Whites was also noted in the Coleman Report back in 1966. This report was authorized by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and carried out under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. {snip}</p>
<p>The Coleman Report even found that Black scores averaged below those of American Indians, despite that group scoring lower on most socioeconomic indicators.</p>
<p>Coleman also found  &mdash;  perhaps surprisingly in 1966  &mdash;  that the educational resources devoted to Blacks and Whites were nearly equal, even in the South. But none of the expected financial or educational &#8220;inputs&#8221; could be correlated with any of the performance &#8220;outputs&#8221;.</p>
<p>Instead, the main determinant of a child&rsquo;s score was his own parents&rsquo; socioeconomic status  &mdash;  not the amount of money spent on schools. Going to a good or a bad school, by itself, apparently had little influence on the students&rsquo; performance on standardized tests.</p>
<p>The Coleman Report did find, however, that Black students who attended middle-class majority White schools achieved higher than other Black students. Coleman surmised this was due to peer attitudes in such schools. Accordingly, he recommended that Black students be assigned to schools where there was a majority of middle class attitude. This earned Coleman the moniker &#8220;the sociologist who inspired busing&#8221;.</p>
<p>Across much of the U.S., court-ordered busing forcibly transferred tens of thousands of White and Black students to each other&rsquo;s schools. But by 1975, Coleman wrote that school busing had simply led to &#8220;white flight&#8221; as parents moved their children to private schools and ever more distant suburbs outside of the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction. {snip}</p>
<p>Jensen and I were able to go even further back in time. We examined studies from 1954 to 1965 in the State of Georgia, with data on reading and mathematics from 1,500 White and 800 Black students given the California Achievement Test; and in Virginia, with data on reading from 2,000 Black and White students.</p>
<p>Those studies too showed that by grade 10 (age 16), the average Black  &mdash;  White gap was about three years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lowest scores in our analysis came from the gold standard NAEP tests (70, 71, and 77). In our review of Nisbett&rsquo;s book mentioned earlier, Jensen and I noted the possibility that the mean African American IQ might actually be only 78 rather than 85  &mdash;  in part because, even today, test developers and educational researchers seldom get to examine the very lowest scoring segments of the Black population in inner cities.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results indicate no significant Black gain in educational achievement for over 50 years. When evidence in favor of Black gains is presented, it typically rests on insufficient sampling and highly selective reporting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Our conclusion: predictions about the Black  &mdash;  White IQ gap narrowing are based on faith rather than evidence, wishful thinking rather than critical analysis.</p>

		<p>This is bad news and a harmful, hurtful interpretation.</p>
<p>Our ememies will now spin the achievement gap as proof that racists are to blame for it all.  The result will be the destruction of opportunities for achievement by White students.</p>
<p>Our White children will be taught that if they achieve academically, they are robbing a blacks for their opportunity to feel good about themselves.</p>
<p>Whites will be restricted from private schools and honors programs. No White will be allowed to surge forward unless they are surrounded by enough blacks to hold them down and drown them.</p>
<p>You know it&rsquo;s true.<br>

<p>This could be read to mean, if we only have enough income equality - say another 40 years of affirmative action - the black white gap may decrease. Except that the more &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; we have, the more black kids are raised poor in public housing. </p>

<p>What it forgot to do, or left out for the sake of intellectual dishonesty, is to compare whites in middle class majority white schools with less well to do whites.  It would have found a similar persistent gap, if not a big gap.</p>

		<p>Having been involved with the &#8220;No Child Left Behind&#8221; push to equalize test score results for blacks and Hispanics compared with those of whites and Asians, I can tell you that this truth is the &#8220;800 pound gorilla in the living room&#8221; which no one wants to recognize.</p>
<p>Instead, blame is shifted to faulty teaching, lack of effective methodology, and one program after another to close the gap. For those teachers who have been &#8220;in the trenches&#8221; of minority public school education for the past three years as I have, there&rsquo;s a realization that no matter how much methodology and change of personnel gets thrown at the problem, including some really brilliant young teachers coming out of Ivy League colleges, that the I.Q. difference between blacks and Hispanics on the one hand and whites and Asians on the other, which is mainly inherited genetically, is an insurmountable obstacle no matter how much effort and good intentions is being put into equalizing test results.</p>

		<p>If by some strange quirk of fate we get through this depression without civil/racial war&hellip;..which is highly doubtful&hellip;&hellip;then the next best thing is to set up a parallel society for those whites who can, living in a remote location and home schooling, with tight parental control on what the kids watch on T.V. and at the movies.</p>
<p>As someone said before on here, these academics who call themselves researchers and scientists are earning a reputation worse than used car salesmen.  </p>
<p>Why they want to push a lie is absolutely amazing and would make an excellent case study for somebody.  It&rsquo;s as if they all share in the same madness.  Usually, these kinds of people are part of criminal enterprises or sect figures who believe some kind of kooky myth that borders on insanity.</p>

		<p>I taught school first in a black ghetto area and then later in a barrio area.  The black kids were just pathetic when compared to what I remembered as average in my own elementary school experience.  It was clear to me that these kids had never had the proper nutrition from day one, AND, their mothers were never properly nourished during their pregnancies.  You can&rsquo;t expect the kids to have normal brain development without proper nutrients.  SugarPops for breakfast, hot Cheetos for snacks, pizza for lunch, and God knows what for dinner.  If they had free lunch and breakfast at school, they threw away half of it.  I frankly don&rsquo;t see a lot of hope for ghetto blacks when this very basic level is left unimproved.  The barrio kids were a bit better, because beans + rice = a perfect protein, so they at least had that.  But they were no better than the black kids at throwing away half the free food that the school gave them.  And, education was NOT a priority in the homes of these kids.  So it is no surprise to me that they&rsquo;re always behind.  Until the guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t takes the raw material into consideration, the real problems will remain unaddressed.</p>

		<p>Freda- you are exactly right! This was the educational level of just about the majority of Americans until the late 1950&rsquo;s when the &#8220;science gap&#8221; between the US and then Soviet Union was brought up. Now college is rammed down everyone&rsquo;s throat and what would have been classes at a vocational or technical high schools are now taught at a community college level. For about 75% of the population an 8th grade academic education (standard until about 1940 to begin with) is about the best that they can acheive and forcing them to endure 4 more years of academics is torture. Considering that most people that are going to drop out of high school will do so at about the 9th or 10th grade level. Quite possibly these kids &#8220;aged out&#8221; of middle school and were placed in high school when they turned 15. If the kids who just did not have the ability for academic studies (barring the behavior problems and slackers) were given a decent vocational education upon entering what would be the ninth grade they would graduate in 2-4 years with a trade. If you poll the average graduating class about 95% would say they wanted to go to college but very few know what they want to study or have any definate career path. Of course this sort of program would immediatly be branded as &#8220;racist&#8221; since the vast majority of the black and Hispanic students would end up on the vocational track and the academic track would be mostly Asian and White. </p>

		<p>The problem with IQ tests is they are given in optimal isolated enviroments, in well lit  quiet, orderly classrooms. Under these<br>
optimal conditions Blacks are capable of thinking at about the level of a 14 year old. But culture, enviroment and reality<br>
are left out of the picture. We dont meet blacks in quiet<br>
controlled enviroments with a pencil and book in front of them. We meet them in gangs on street corners,<br>
in sporting events, in riots, in the act of committing crimes, in finding ways to &#8220;get over&#8221;.<br>
What ever control and reason blacks have is utterly abandoned <br>
once they engage in group behaviour. If they are capable of <br>
an IQ of 85&hellip;in reality we never see even this. We see behaviour<br>
that is normal in IQ 70 or lower. Toss alcohol, and drugs in the mix and nothing rational is left at all.</p>

		<p>I think the figure in Vdare&rsquo;s article shows a different story: the &ldquo;achievement gap&rdquo; between 17-y-o Blacks and 17-y-o Whites has narrowed between 1975 and 1990 indeed. The ratio of Black to White test score values increased consistently from circa 85% in 1975 to 90% in 1990. And the ratio of 17-y-o Hispanics to 17-y-o Whites also increased from circa 88% in 1975 to 92% in 1992. Nevertheless, since 1990-1992, both ratios stalled. So I think some improvement was made in the past but didn&rsquo;t continue for reasons scientists should explain. </p>

Next time you see the SPLC/ADL/Obama Civilian Army Corps media relations office put out a press release about &#8220;discredited racist scientists,&#8221;  find a way to respond by asking &#8220;Who discredited them and where is their report?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then ask why Boas discredited himself for the sake of blacks who couldn&rsquo;t even read his books.</p>
<p>Carleton Putnam, a White Gentleman full of vigorous genius and analytical insight, gave us a lasting monument of how to discredit our opponents and reduce them to the mere propagandists of hate that they are:</p>
<p>Race and Reality, 1967</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2b7w69f" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2b7w69f</a></p>
<p><br>
snip </p>
<p>Perhaps the most effective way to illustrate the trend of Boas&rsquo; development was to examine two editions of his The Mind of Primitive Man. In the 1911 edition he wrote: &#8220;Differences of<br>
structure must be accompanied by differences of function, physiological as well as psychological; and, as we found clear evidence of differences in structure between the races, so we must anticipate that the differences in mental characteristics will be found.&#8221;</p>
<p>This crucial statement Boas omitted, without explanation, from the 1938 edition. One of Boas&rsquo; students and followers, Otto Klineberg, suggested that &#8220;it seems highly probable that Boas<br>
changed his mind on this point.&#8221; </p>
<p>To which Dr. George aptly replied, &#8220;Possibly so; but I know of nothing in the development of anatomy or physiology between 1911 and 1938, or since, to justify a change of mind &hellip;; quite the contrary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boas had said flatly, &#8220;We found clear evidence of differences in structure between the races.&#8221; One might now reasonably ask &mdash; what had happened to these differences?</p>

		<p>An obvious method exists to close the achievement gap. Introduce federal legislation requiring that every white newborn baby be banged on the head a few times, until unconscious (this will even the playing field due to differential parental abuse). Additionally, require that white parents feed their offspring only junk food, except for dinner, when they might get something nutritious, provided that Mom&rsquo;s boyfriend doesn&rsquo;t eat it first (this will even the playing field due to differential nutrition). And, of course, it must also be illegal for white children to have married parents (this will even the playing field due to differential parental investment). </p>

		<p>In the Army, I helped a black soldier get through some tough tests in a very tough school he had no business in.  Afterwards, there was no sence of appreciation for the help, or for acheivement, only a sence of entitlement to lower standards.  </p>
<p>This is attributed to the so called special &#8220;black experience.&#8221;  Thanks to the civil rights act of 1964, reverse racism, and empowerment black racism, all efforts at sane racial relations are doomed.  <br>

		<p>Several years ago, while traveling in Thailand, I met a young and glib Nigerian of around thirty. After I informed him that I&rsquo;m from the United States, he engagedly told me that he had spent a year in Texas attending college. Soon enough, the conversation steered to the subject of race. He opined that the US is hung up on race and told me that it&rsquo;s a taken as a matter of course in Africa that the white man is more intelligent than the black man is, and furthermore, no one is really hung up about it. I was somewhat surprised at that and couldn&rsquo;t imagine having a similar discussion with an American black, although I&rsquo;m certain that many blacks would probably concede that is the case in his heart of hearts. Probably not the discussion that AG Holder has in mind, however!</p>

		<p>Fascinating article! The main point is that there has been ZERO narrowing of the black-white IQ gap in the last half-century -unsurprising since the gap is largely genetic in origin.  </p>
<p>Rushton also notes that in the &#8220;racist&#8221; &#8220;Jim Crow&#8221; South education $ were allocated equally among the races.</p>
<p>And he makes the frightening claim that the average African-American IQ may be 78 rather than the commonly estimated 85.   </p>

By the third grade black kids are good first graders.It is like the kids go to the dark side of the Moon where they receive no intellectual stimulation for 12 weeks.The violence starts about age 10. By now, even with social promotion, the black kids are three years behind and physically about two years ahead of white kids. Most all black girls have reached menarcke by 10.5 and then all Hell breaks loose for them.They all said that what amazed them was that white kids seemed to teach themselves. The sixth grade teachers were so cynical that they would have made great late night tv hosts.They said that 75% of all black kids quit even trying to learn and all they do with them is to keep them from bullying white kids and assaulting the staff.<br>

		<p>&#8220;why do we insist that everyone finish high school and go to college&hellip;&hellip;. a good 8th grade education with some high level trade school would do many just fine, black and white and mexican too&hellip;&hellip;..&#8221;</p>
<p>This is so true.  I&rsquo;ve always seen doom in the lack of a manufacturing base.  The truth is that in any society, you need the trades as well as those who do the work.</p>
<p>It just so happens that the US is particularly top heavy in these people, and we&rsquo;ve made the mistake of selling out out manufacturing base, while acquiring tons of people suited only for the trades- when not ill-suited even for that.  We&rsquo;ve decided that while we have a wealth of people and continue to import more for the express purpose of working in labor and trades all of those people deserve to be college material. </p>
<p>The US has a history of vigorously filling its labor pools.  The problem is that the base for such huge labor pools is gone, because our government gave it away.  We&rsquo;ve outsourced and demolished everything that was the purpose for continued immigration, and the foundation of the lower classes.</p>
<p>We continue to meet labor demand in a way that&rsquo;s been outmoded for a long time, while at the same time pretending that not just the excess, but ALL of them, should become the creative/ scientific class, somehow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stupid and insane.</p>

		<p>I think the figure in Vdare&rsquo;s article shows a different story: the &ldquo;achievement gap&rdquo; between 17-y-o Blacks and 17-y-o Whites has narrowed between 1975 and 1990 indeed. The ratio of Black to White test score values increased consistently from circa 85% in 1975 to 90% in 1990. And the ratio of 17-y-o Hispanics to 17-y-o Whites also increased from circa 88% in 1975 to 92% in 1992. Nevertheless, since 1990-1992, both ratios stalled. So I think some improvement was made in the past but didn&rsquo;t continue for reasons scientists should explain. <br>

Prior to the civil rights movement the achievement gap was due partially to poorly funded black schools and primarily to genetic difference.  Because of the civil rights legislation that was signed during the 1960&rsquo;s blacks and whites attend schools with comparable funding.  The gap diminished slightly.  It remains because of genetic differences.  </p>

		<p>Highly useful data indeed. Two quick thoughts:</p>
<p>1.  The ever-incessant demands on the federal and state levels for &#8220;more&#8221; spending on &#8220;education&#8221; must be blunted with this kind of evidence. Unless spending hikes are targeted to higher achieving students with very specific resource acquisitions in mind, i.e., training to use new technologies, acquisition of new technologies, revamping curricula to make them more challenging or at least what they were decades ago in humanitities and social science, spending hikes are a waste of time. If you can&rsquo;t freeze spending on education for idiots, at least remove them from the academic track and teach them skills commesurate with their abilities. In many cases that means apprenticeships, or, if they won&rsquo;t work or do so honestly, hard labor camps.</p>
<p>2.  The gap, if it exists, between various nationally-based immigrant groups and whites should be as carefully studied as Jensen and Rushton have done for the black/white gap.</p>
<p>3.  The education establishment, and their numerous supporters in Congress and the White House will reject such studies. That is a powerful reason for the thinking and voting public to reject these spenders on &#8220;vaporwear&#8221; dressed as education. fignki rthui </p>

		<p>I think that White racialists need to start worrying about how to compete with asians (again), and FINALLY show some solidarity. If those 2 things can be done then the rest will work itself out, IMO. Or to go ever farther then that, I will say that Whites need to look within and do some soul-searching, and ask themselves what really makes them special and unique. They need to come to terms with who they really are, and find the courage, will, and pride that their forefathers were so renowned for.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have a degree in science (and the scientists in my family are currently asleep) but I will explain to you why there was a rise in test scores viz. blacks and hispanics.</p>
<p>Listen up carefully:</p>
<p>The Tests Have Been Dumbed Down.    Repeatedly.</p>
<p>How would I know this?  I&rsquo;ve been giving NAEP tests for over two decades and I&rsquo;ve gotten a good look at them, all of them, at the high school level. I am not allowed to copy any section of the test, but I have  a chance to study it every year for about a week.  What you see in the practice books and as &#8216;typical examples&rsquo; in the newspapers of what is on the state tests is not what is on the tests. </p>
<p><br>
Many sections of the SAT were removed after it was &#8216;re-normed&rsquo; in 1996, the more difficult sections of the test, that is, such as analogies disappeared. There is also tremendous pressure to discredit and therefore eliminate the SATs entirely.  I suspect the sections that were removed in 1996 were those where blacks and hispanics scored the lowest. The math section also was pushed down (as in made easier).  The newest push is to eliminate SAT IIs (also where blacks and hispanics do poorly)  &mdash;  and of course there are the accusations from the left that the test doesn&rsquo;t measure anything except memorization and is not a measure of one&rsquo;s future performance in college  &mdash;  although every indicator is that that is exactly what the SAT measures, the vocab section in particular.</p>
<p>As Charles Murray explains in Real Education:   NAEP tests (unlike SAT) do not measure g (general intelligence)  &mdash;  they measure simple concepts that are easy to memorize and regurgitate on a multiple-choice test.</p>
<p>What is on the actual tests themselves is far easier, insultingly easy that what is shown to the public  &mdash;  any one of us on here would laugh at what passes for high-school level math problems and what is considered as a measure of one&rsquo;s ability to read and comprehend the English language.</p>
<p>The educational establishment tells the public its goals are &#8216;rigor&rsquo; and &#8216;high standards&rsquo; and &#8216;high quality.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe it.  </p>
<p>Its goal is to produce equality of results, to prove that race is a social construct and IQ is meaningless (while the muckity-mucks in the Ivory Towers send their own precious children to Sidwell Friends-type college academies or K-12 highly academic, ethnic-based programs).  Another important goal is to destroy Whites  &mdash;  this is evident throughout the school curricula and by the elimination of programs that serve White children (AP, honors, science labs, field trips to local museums, enrichment programs for those of high intelligence)  &mdash;  preferring to funnel the monies to reading programs, &#8216;outreach&rsquo; and enrichment programs for blacks and hispanics.</p>
<p>I think the dumbing down has reached its limits.</p>
<p>The problem with dumbing down the tests is that White kids improve as well  &mdash;  and the educational establishment can&rsquo;t have that!  Any decrease in White scores is cheered (as it &#8216;closes the gap&rsquo; AND debases Whites).  What to do?</p>
<p>Completely ignore White children except to feed them execrable lies about White achievement and load up their schools by busing in violent blacks.  If Whites scream about busing, move Section 8 housing into their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The entire system  &mdash;  hell our entire culture is built on a pack of lies.  Brimelow believes it will come crashing down soon, but I&rsquo;m not so sure  &mdash;  I believe ever-more lies will be constructed to shore up the original lies and more legislation will be passed to harshly punish those who challenges the lies.</p>

		<p>This debate has been settled a long time ago. Blacks improve academically when in a school 85%+ white. If the black numbers get above 10-15% then their numbers slide back down as their nihilistic culture spreads through the student body. </p>

&#8220;I taught school first in a black ghetto area and then later in a barrio area. The black kids were just pathetic when compared to what I remembered as average in my own elementary school experience. It was clear to me that these kids had never had the proper nutrition from day one, AND, their mothers were never properly nourished during their pregnancies. You can&rsquo;t expect the kids to have normal brain development without proper nutrients.&#8221;</p>
<p>If nourishment/environment are the causes of black low I.Q. and inability to learn, why do African blacks, who have adequate diets, always score lower than American blacks?</p>
<p>And, why do Vietnamese children, who are malnourished when they come to this country, some of whom have phsical deformities and can&rsquo;t speak the language, outperform blacks by a wide margin?</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that gullible people are beginning to fall for this constant barrage of lies from the radical left which is doing its best to try to create the belief that it is nourishment/environment that determines I.Q. and not genes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Black Myths that have been created that were  intended to fool everybody into believing that blacks accomplished things they did not, repeated over and over again, until some unsophisticated types begin using the lies as a base of facts.</p>
<p>White gullibility has always been a problem for whites throughout history.</p>

		<p>I wonder what the average teacher thinks when seeing the class for the first time at the beginning of the school year? It must take a tremendous willpower to think the blacks will keep up with the curriculum when, in fact, they won&rsquo;t. The blacks screw themselves before they even start.</p>

		<p>Its always been my contention that the black IQ is overstated. 85 seesm too high when you see how blacks behave;its not uncommon to read a story about a black criminal,and its remarked the poor dear had an IQ of the mid 70&rsquo;s. I think the &#8220;better&#8221; blacks are more likely to be in school and be tested. The lower IQ ones are simply not there. In modern schools now,of course,theres a new factor:cheating. Many schools,under pressure to perform,simply &#8220;encourage&#8221; the real dullards to &#8220;be sick that day&#8221; when testing time comes!! </p>

<p><i>Many sections of the SAT were removed after it was &lsquo;re-normed&rsquo; in 1996&hellip;</i></p>
<p>I remember the score re-norming well.  I know the scoring scheme was &#8220;re-normed&#8221; in the summer of 1994.  I know this because I took the final SAT before the re-norming, that being June &#8216;94.  During the next school year, I found a conversion chart in my guidance counselor&rsquo;s office.  I used it to convert the scores I got (780M, 570V) into the scores I would have received if I simply waited to take the SATs in September, and I would have gotten 800M 640V for the same raw number of correct answers, meaning my 1350 combined would have magically become 1440.  Almost all raw scores got score increases, save a very few in what I would term the above average section. </p>
<p>Now, why the SAT did this was beyond me   &mdash;   They said the college admissions people were aware of the &#8220;re-centering,&#8221; so, e.g. I&rsquo;m assuming that a 1440 turned in in 9/94 would have been interpreted as a 1350 from 6/94.  If that&rsquo;s the case, then why re-center to begin with?  I also noticed that it was now possible to get a &#8220;perfect&#8221; 800 without getting every question correct, as my one wrong answer was 780 before and 800 now.  That explains the sudden increase in &#8220;perfect&#8221; SAT tests.</p>
<p>So why bother to begin with?  Answer:  I think it had something to do with minorities, and, with the slight decrease in scores in the above average section, slightly dragging down whites.</p>
<p>I also know the SAT has been further re-centered since 1994, on at least one occasion.  The math section lets you use almost computer-like graphing calculators, which means that, unless the math questions have become more difficult, then it&rsquo;s that much easier for a test-taker to do well on the math part.</p>

		<p>Bon,</p>
<p>I could not agree with you more.  Personally, I could care less whether a student passes those high school exit exams many states give.  So a SENIOR in high school is minimally competent in 8th math and 9th grade English?  So? Trust me, those tests are not testing on 12th grade English and 12th grade math.  Imagine if they actually did though.  My guess would be about 20% of the students would pass.  </p>
<p>Those tests are a pathetic waste of time and money.  They only tell us that someone is at best four years behind where they should be.  What shocks me the most is that discussions about these tests never seem to call out this one major issue.  </p>
<p>BTW my aunt is a teacher and I have seen many samples of the standardized tests they give these days.  They are ridiculously easy.  For example, the eighth grade test would present absolutely no challenge whatsoever to someone who actually does math and English at an eighth grade level.  Yet for some reason, a huge chunk of students flunk these tests.  </p>
<p>Why not just let people get an eighth grade education as someone above suggested?  If anything, it would probably IMPROVE most people prospects.    </p>

<p>You are far too generous.  In my district in Los Angeles, I&rsquo;d guess 5-10%  &mdash;  except 12th grade is no longer the 12th grade we &#8216;old-timers&rsquo; remember.  </p>
<p>My old textbooks from the 50-60&rsquo;s show that what was considered 6th-8th grade level &#8216;back in the day&rsquo; is about 12th grade level today.  Old 50s, early 60&rsquo;s 12th grade texts resemble what are now college texts.  Gone today are the difficult math application problems (&#8216;word problems&rsquo;) that challenged  &mdash;  or washed out  &mdash;   many of us in Alg, Geometry, Alg II and Trig.  Now it is nothing but formula and process, concepts only, no proofs, application or &#8216;real-world&rsquo; problems.  Is the kid really doing math?</p>
<p>And you know what else?  When I open the inside covers of those old texts, I can see by the students&rsquo; signatures that those books were used for about a decade-and there&rsquo;s not a mark in them.  Texts these days are ripped apart by the end of one semester  &mdash;  filled with sunflower seeds, graffiti, torn-up pages, the covers ripped off  &mdash;  never mind that they cost approximately $75 each, often more.  By law, the kid cannot be held back, denied graduation or held to account for damaged/missing texts.   What a waste, what a waste.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Those tests are a pathetic waste of time and money. They only tell us that someone is at best four years behind where they should be. What shocks me the most is that discussions about these tests never seem to call out this one major issue&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d lose my job and reputation if I were to do so  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ve had to bite my tongue to the point of bleeding in teachers&rsquo; meetings to keep from yelling about racial IQ differences.  I&rsquo;d love to present a fierce power-point lecture about racial differences  &mdash;  only I wouldn&rsquo;t leave the room alive!  I&rsquo;d be dead right as the old expression goes.  Ask Jensen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to cover up the lies about IQ being meaningless, race is a social construct, we all have equal abilities  &mdash;  as we move closer to a full-blown police state, the authoritarian government will pass Hate Speech laws that will severely punish anyone who deigns to mention racial differences or question PC re-written historical events.</p>
<p>You did know that the wise, peaceful Iroquois Nation wrote the Constitution of the United States, didn&rsquo;t you?  That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in modern history texts.  Question it at grave risk to your career.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Yet for some reason, a huge chunk of students flunk these tests&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Non-White/Asians flunk these tests due to intractable low IQs and disinterest in education.  With blacks, it is due to low IQ plus an entire panoply of deviant behaviors  &mdash;  aggression and an inability to sit still and keep quiet  &mdash;  trying to educate most of them is utterly pointless and a waste of time and money.   Can&rsquo;t put it any better than that.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Why not just let people get an eighth grade education as someone above suggested? If anything, it would probably IMPROVE most people prospects&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Agreed.  Or at least weed them out at the 8th grade and funnel them off to VoTec or state prison-the only problem is Whites and Asians would go on in vastly disproportionate numbers and blacks and hispanics would be weeded out.  If I were God, this is what I&rsquo;d do  &mdash;  what is the point of dragging kids who are already utter failures through four more years of school and telling them &#8216;You Can Be Anything You Want to Be!&#8221;  &mdash;  with the implicit message that if they don&rsquo;t succeed it is NOT THEIR FAULT  &mdash;  it is the fault of a White racist, oppressive system that is rigged against them.</p>
<p>Do you now see why they hate Whites so much??  YOU ruined their chances of becoming a pediatrician, lawyer or astronaut!  It is YOUR fault you racist White oppressor!  I am poor, in prison, on the streets because of YOU RACIST WHITES.</p>
<p>Believe me, this is what American blacks believe.  Just look at one of their discussion threads on one of their White-hating sites.</p>

Thanks for your remark. I&rsquo;m happy you acknowledge &ldquo;the gap diminished slightly&rdquo; which by the way is flatly denied by Mr. Rushton in his VDare article. I also think genetic differences may explain why the gap has stalled since the beginning of the nineties but of course more research is needed. </p>

I thank you too for replying. Your point is interesting and could explain why the curve for 14-y-o Whites shows a consistent upward trend throughout the period. Nevertheless the curve for 17-y-o Whites is quite different being essentially flat which runs counter your argument unless the NAEP test debasing you mention didn&rsquo;t occur in the 17-y-o cohort. <br>

<p>I am not surprised that the 17-year old White cohort remains flat.</p>
<p>In the government schools, bright White children, starting in kindergarten, are shunted to the side, utterly ignored, mainstreamed in &#8216;regular&rsquo; classes, used as teachers&rsquo; aides or tutors.  These bright children should be the very ones who are nurtured, coddled, given special attention and enrichment, challenged, offered special science/math programs, partnered with mentors, offered free summer science camps  &mdash;  just as black and hispanic students are.  But they aren&rsquo;t.  </p>
<p>Bright White children in government schools often drop out before or by age 17, and for good reason.  They are bored, and have been for years, unmotivated, often socially outcast, see school as of no use.  They are sick of the PC madness, miffed that blacks and hispanics receive all the accolades, special programs and attention, tired of the multi-culturalism, a curricula that calls them evil  &mdash;  they are more intelligent than most of the teachers and they know it.  They have nothing but scathing words for teacher, administrators and other students.</p>
<p>I know this because I&rsquo;ve had almost three decades of first hand experience in the government schools and this is what my 16-year old son and his friends tell me in the privacy of our home including Asians who complain that they are discriminated against even more than Whites, which for the most part, is true.</p>
<p>The very brightest students, the &rsquo;10s&rsquo; (and even the 8s and 9s), almost entirely White and Asian (including East Indian), have the hardest time in the government schools  &mdash;  they are ignored by the staff, often teased as nerds, bullied, ostracized, mocked, impugned.  I understand that they have one of the highest drop-out rates, if not the highest.  No one does a thing for them  &mdash;  there are no &#8216;task forces&rsquo; special government funds, branches of research that focus on them and their unique needs.  I believe it is because they are White.  </p>
<p>Why should these kids do well on the tests?  No one prepares them, no one at school cares about them, they do not &#8216;rise to the top like Cream&rsquo; as we teachers hear in ed schools and teachers&rsquo; meetings; rather, they sink like stones.  Ask any high school teacher:  Classes are known by the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>Asians are at least waking up, forming legal advocacy groups and transferring their bright children to language or race-based college academies.  Whites are increasingly pulling their children out as well.</p>
<p> I had to pull my son out of middle school because he couldn&rsquo;t take it any longer.  If we hadn&rsquo;t rescued him he would have started ditching school, purposely failing or just refusing to go.  I&rsquo;m forever grateful that his high school offers AP classes  &mdash;  real AP classes with real teachers teaching a real AP curriculum.   I had to buy the required supplemental material myself (about $75) and pay for the test ($85)  &mdash;   things not supplied for AP students by the school.  I was lucky the school supplied the text as it was a college text that looked like it cost about $200.</p>
<p> A teacher at this school told me he fought the school board, hard, for two years to retain honors and AP classes as they were on the chopping block  &mdash;  he won, but said it was a Pyrrhic victory and that he wouldn&rsquo;t do it again.</p>
<p>This is why I keep repeating here:  Get your bright White kids out of schools that cater to the lowest IQ cohorts., do it now and don&rsquo;t look back. Yes, you must pay property and other taxes to fund schools that reject your precious White child but at the moment, there is no other way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a decision you will never regret.</p>

<p>I understand completely why there is no discussion about how ridiculous it is to give Jr High level tests to seniors and then call it &#8220;equivalent&#8221; to a high school diploma.  My aunt the teacher has told me many times that you simply cannot risk your job by bringing these things up.  I have noticed that many people on this board make the erroneous assumption that teachers support this absurdity.  By and large, the majority of teachers are AGAINST these tests, PC garbage and pandering to failing students.  Most teachers still think that the old-fashioned way of learning and discipline is best.  BTW, teachers do not have that much control over this stuff.  All the blame for &#8220;failing&#8221; schools needs to be placed squarely on the administrators.  </p>
<p>Heck I am 28 and was therefore right at the cusp of massive standardized testing.  I am so glad I got out in time.  My aunt says all they do now is teach to the test.  I remember going through that for a couple weeks before the test - it was dull, pointless and I never learned a darn thing.  Also, the tests were insanely easy and my score was always &#8220;99th percentile.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The thing is though, if the test actually tested a student on 12th grade math and 12th grade English, I would not have a problem with it at all.  If this were the standard, then a high school diploma would actually MEAN something. What is the point of getting an &#8220;education&#8221; if it has a limited value in the job market?  I have seen many, many job postings for positions like secretary which require a college degree.  You do not need a college degree to be a secretary.  The problem is that these days proof of a high school diploma simply does not guarantee that you are minimally competent in grammar and writing.  </p>
<p>So in an effort to make sure that EVERYONE gets a high school diploma, the powers that be have lowered the standards so much that now that diploma is essentially worthless.  Now NO ONE has proof that they are educated without producing a college degree.  Brilliant, isn&rsquo;t it?  In our liberal, misguided effort to include everyone, we have made sure that no one gets any benefit.  Now I would like to hope that this is simply a case of irony or unintended consequences, but I am mostly convinced that it is intentional.    </p>

		<p>Anyone who has spent substantal time among blacks like I have, living in Birmingham, Alabama for a while, and having worked in construction trades for ten years will have to come to the sad but realistic conclusion that blacks simply are not as intelligent as whites, and that&rsquo;s the reality of it.  My parents were both from poor, working-class backgrounds and lived through the Great Depression. Despite their lack of &#8220;opportunities&#8221;, as liberals who wear rose-colored glasses would say, they both managed to do very well. So, i can&rsquo;t speak from any educational experience, but believe me seeing how dysfunctional and pathetic many blacks are, was a real eye-opener. But finally, when the hell are people going to wake up this fact of life.  Personally, I&rsquo;m sick and tired of paying taxes at continonously failed attempts to try to bring them up to our level.  All one has to do is also go to Africa.  I was in Somalia complements of the military. </p>

<p>&#8216;&hellip;I remember the score re-norming well. I know the scoring scheme was &#8216;re-normed&rsquo; in the summer of 1994&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry for the error on the date, I checked my sources again  &mdash;  one listed SAT re-centering occurring in 1996 (which I used), another 1994 and three more, 1995. </p>
<p>Recentering essentially added 80 points to the average verbal SAT score and 20 to the average math SAT score to bring them both back up to about 500.  The College Board was particularly worried about the verbal scores.</p>
<p>You write:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Now, why the SAT did this was beyond me&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Educational critic Diane Ravitch writes:</p>
<p>As of 1995, the SAT mathematics score had increased to 482 (and it was up another two point in 1996)..but the verbal scores scarcely budged, never rising above 431&hellip; the verbal scores of non-Hispanic white students had not risen above 450 in twenty years.  </p>
<p>The College Board chose to &#8216;recenter&rsquo; the SAT&hellip; Beginning in 1995, it arbitrarily declared that the abysmal verbal average in the 420s was now to be treated as a 500&hellip;The reasons, the College Board said, were entirely technical.    Now the once-embarrassing verbal scores appear to be substantially higher&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;for the past generation, the United States has had a huge and unaddressed problem in the teaching of the English language.  </p>
<p>One need only read the abortive &#8216;national English standards&rsquo; to see the incoherence and jargon that has invaded the field of &#8216;language arts&rsquo;, apparently driving out concern for careful use of the English language. The SAT test  requires knowledge of the English language&rsquo;s grammar, structure, and vocabulary.  ..&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/28edhgc" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/28edhgc</a></p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I also know the SAT has been further re-centered since 1994, on at least one occasion&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the mid-90s (after the first re-norming):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Students must complete the math section in 60 minutes, rather than 90 minutes as was once the case, but they may use a calculator throughout the testing period. The Wall Street Journal reported last year that the writers of the SAT were checking how various demographic groups performed on various math questions. Some of the questions that stumped them were dropped&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Everything, it seems, is being twisted around in this country to benefit non-Whites at all levels, at all ages, at the expense of Whites.</p>

		<p>Hunnnnn, now here&rsquo;s something interesting to read.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tsowell.com/speducat.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.tsowell.com/speducat.html</a></p>
<p>Excerpt</p>
<p>&#8221;  In standardized tests given that year, students in the black high school averaged higher test scores than students in two of the three white high schools.2<br>
      This was not a fluke.  It so happens that I have followed 85 years of the history of this black high school  &mdash;   from 1870 to 1955   &mdash;  and found it repeatedly equalling or exceeding national norms on standardized tests.3  In the 1890s, it was called The M Street School and after 1916 it was renamed Dunbar High School but its academic performances on standardized tests remained good on into the mid-1950s.<br>
      When I first published this information in 1974, those few educators who responded at all dismissed the relevance of these findings by saying that these were &#8220;middle class&#8221; children and therefore their experience was not &#8220;relevant&#8221; to the education of low-income minority children.  Those who said this had no factual data on the incomes or occupations of the parents of these children  &mdash;   and I did.<br>
      The problem, however, was not that these dismissive educators did not have evidence.  The more fundamental problem was that they saw no need for evidence.  According to their dogmas, children who did well on standardized tests were middle class.  These children did well on such tests, therefore they were middle class.<br>
      Lack of evidence is not the problem.  There was evidence on the occupations of the parents of the children at this school as far back in the early 1890s.  As of academic year 1892-93, there were 83 known occupations of the parents of the children attending The M Street School.  Of these occupations, 51 were laborers and one was a doctor.4  That doesn&rsquo;t sound very middle class to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, for a comment.</p>

		<p> Anon #42 writes, quoting from an article by Dr. Sowell:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Back in 1899, in Washington, D. C., there were four academic public high schools  &mdash;   one black and three white.  In standardized tests given that year, students in the black high school averaged higher test scores than students in two of the three white high schools&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>1899?</p>
<p>Fast forward to the modern era.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the results of billions upon billions of educational dollars fire-hosed specifically at blacks to close the achievement gap (via Title 1 funds and other special programs not available to White children)  &mdash;  billions upon billion of dollars over and above what White children receive</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The achievement gap is large and persistent&hellip;Things are actually even worse. Only slightly more than half of blacks graduate from high school, as opposed to 72 percent of whites.</p>
<p>The gap is not closing. In the past 29 years, neither minority group has ever scored higher than the 30th percentile of the white distribution in reading, math or science.</p>
<p>Scores on the Scholastic Achievement Test (SAT) show the same pattern. In 1976, there was a 240-point gap between black and white combined scores, and the difference narrowed to 189 points in 1988. Since then, the gap has grown larger again, reaching 206 points in 2003&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>So, despite the government helicoptering fiat dollars  &mdash;  billions, if not trillions of them  &mdash;  at blacks for 50 years to raise their test scores to the level of Whites, it hasn&rsquo;t worked. </p>
<p>Please tell us why you think the achievement gap between blacks/hispanics and White/Asians is large, persistent and intractable.</p>
<p>What do you think is the cause of black underachievement, black school failure and abysmal black test scores and what do you believe will close the achievement gap?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very interested in your answers.</p>

<p>The point being that it any race or group can achieve if conditions permit it.</p>
<p>It has also been shown, that Northern Blacks scored higher than Southern on military tests.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sowell" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sowell</a><br>
&#8220;As far back as WWI, black soldiers from various Northern States like New York, Pennsylvania, etc. scored higher on Army intelligence tests than southern whites from various southern states like Mississippi, Alabama and others.[46]&#8221;</p>
<p>So how did this happen, race, environment,or the inclination to learn?</p>
<p>Just wondering&hellip;&hellip;..about these &#8220;two groups&#8221;. </p>

		<p>I read these articulate comments by obviously bright posters, and I am dumbfounded. If blacks have an average IQ of 78, why is there a black person as the commentator on virtually every program on the Science Channel? Every newscast I watch has a super smart black guy parsing the details for us. Why is the head of NASA a black guy? Hmmmm? Even advertisements speak the truth, with a black egghead helping useless white guys in some task. And don&rsquo;t forget the smartest guy on the planet, Barry.</p>

<p>They achieve as far as their innate abilities take them.  This is not in dispute.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;So how did this happen, race, environment,or the inclination to learn?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s those pesky, selective IQ tests the army insists on using:  </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;By drawing just from blacks with relatively high IQs, the Army has managed to sidestep a huge number of problems. The magic bullet that the military has found turns out to be - IQ tests.</p>
<p>Even in the 1970s when the quality of white recruits was low, respectable black families were proud to send their children into the Army. Back then.. 90 percent of black enlistees were high school graduates, compared to only 40 percent of whites.</p>
<p>The Army is a heavy user of aptitude tests&hellip; about a fifth of all whites and three-fifths of all blacks don&rsquo;t make the cut.</p>
<p>83 percent of white recruits scored in the upper half of the mental aptitude test, while 59 percent of black recruits scored in the upper half (compared with 14 percent of the black youths nationwide).</p>
<p>There are still differences, so whites tend to predominate in the most intellectually-challenging military jobs&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/2abo36z</p>
<p>The military certainly doesn&rsquo;t believe that &#8216;IQ Is irrelevant&rsquo;:  They need to identify who is capable of repairing their jet engines, and quickly. </p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t cite sources, but I imagine the information is still out there, so one could find it online because I stumbled upon this information not too long ago. Due to history and migratory patterns, etc., Blacks&rsquo; genetic admixture in the North averages around 50% Sub-Saharan African DNA while the average genetic admixture for all US Blacks averages around 80% Sub-Saharan African DNA, which is more telling when one also finds out that only 10% of White Southerners have ANY (usually near zero percent) amount of Sub-Saharan African genetic admixture compared to a third (33.3%) of all US Whites having ANY (usually near zero percent) amount of Sub-Saharan African genetic admixture.</p>
