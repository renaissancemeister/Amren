<h1><a href="https://www.physorg.com/news197205498.html">Tibetan Adaptation to High Altitude Occurred in Less Than 3,000 Years</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Sanders, PhysOrg.com, July 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A comparison of the genomes of 50 Tibetans and 40 Han Chinese shows that ethnic Tibetans split off from the Han less than 3,000 years ago and since then rapidly evolved a unique ability to thrive at high altitudes and low oxygen levels.</p>
<p>The genome-wide comparison, performed by evolutionary biologists at the University of California, Berkeley, uncovered more than 30 genes with DNA mutations that have become more prevalent in Tibetans than Han Chinese, nearly half of which are related to how the body uses oxygen. One mutation in particular spread from fewer than 10 percent of the Han Chinese to nearly 90 percent of all Tibetans.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the fastest genetic change ever observed in humans,&#8221; said Rasmus Nielsen, UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology, who led the statistical analysis. &#8220;For such a very strong change, a lot of people would have had to die simply due to the fact that they had the wrong version of a gene.&#8221;</p>
<p>The widespread mutation in Tibetans is near a gene called EPAS1, a so-called &#8220;super athlete gene&#8221; identified several years ago and named because some variants of the gene are associated with improved athletic performance, Nielsen said. The gene codes for a protein involved in sensing oxygen levels and perhaps balancing aerobic and anaerobic metabolism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nielsen and his colleagues in China and Europe report their findings in the July 2 issue of the journal Science.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;This is the fastest genetic change ever observed in humans,&rsquo; said Rasmus Nielsen, UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology, who led the statistical analysis. &#8216;For such a very strong change, a lot of people would have had to die simply due to the fact that they had the wrong version of a gene.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is Darwinian selection in action. Those that had the mutation survived, those that did NOT perished. And you have to wonder what caused a populace to &#8220;wander&#8221; into such an unforgiving and harsh climate as the Tibetan plateau?</p>
<p>Same with the Eskimo. They adapted just perfectly to the environment, but the climate is so harsh you have to wonder what caused them to go there in the first place. The earliest explorers to the Arctic ventured the guess that the Eskimo must have been descendants of fugitives from some sort of tribal justice. That seems not to be so?</p>

		<p>Adaptation or acclimation? Let&rsquo;s compare with &#8216;twins&rsquo; or foreigners living and raised in Tibet. </p>

		<p>Evolution can happen quite quickly when helped along by a disaster which eliminates a good part of a certain population.  That could be war, famine, plague, or a change in environment.  If the survivors have markedly different traits than the victims, and the disaster forces cultural changes, the next generation of that society may be quite unlike their grandparents.  </p>

		<p>3,000 years of human evoution can produce differences in the ability to breathe in higher altitudes, but the PC crowd wants us to think that 50,000 years of evolution couldn&rsquo;t produce differences in instincts or intelligence&hellip;</p>

I once read that cheetahs had gone through a relatively recent (in evolutionary terms) an evolutionary bottleneck that resulted in the population of wild cheetahs being genetically similar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not inconceivable that any animal population, including man, could experience such a similar fate (and likely have in the past).<br>

		<p>I still think there is something Lamarckian going on.  Evolve or Die would influence only those genes which were actively accessible (i.e. &#8216;known&rsquo;, somehow, to the body) during one&rsquo;s lifetime as being functionally affective upon the environmental hazard.  And muteably alterable through continued reselection or transposition with other -variants- of the same gene in time to rescue a stressed population in the next one.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s purely a Darwinian selection process going on, at some point either the disaster selector must abate as the stress level lowers (probably less than a generation, given the indicated complications due to low natal oxygenation factors in the womb).</p>
<p>Or you have to hit a diminishing returns zone on deaths from a fixed resource pool of extant genetic variants of this EPAS-1 gene.  Forcing extinction.</p>
<p>It gets even more complicated when you realize that some genes code more than once and some -systems- require more than one chemical or morphologic change to take full advantage of a single mutation.</p>
<p>I seriously believe we are only seeing (or being told anyway) about half the issues with genetics and particularly epigenetics as a function of these &#8216;exon&rsquo; active mutatative gene sequence alterations.  Some factor is keeping the total system balanced like a well tuned engine across, not just one advantaged individual, but the entire group genome.</p>

		<p>Differences in average academic performance and test scores between races can be traced to the comparatively recent development of civilization.  In Paleolithic and Neolithic societies the best hunters and warriors had the most wives, and consequently the most children.  <br>
 <br>
A society based on cities rewards the intelligence necessary to become successful merchants, artisans, artists, and government officials.   <br>

		<p>Phooey.  The ability of Tibetans and some Chilean Indio groups to function well in thin, cold air is just a social construct.  Blacks, homosexuals and Muslims are being unfairly denied access to this ability by racist whites.  (Are we also &#8220;altitudists&#8221; now?)</p>
<p>In related news, the antiquated fascist belief that one variety of horse is faster or slower than another is being challenged in court by Attorney General Holder.</p>
