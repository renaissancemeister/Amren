<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/andrew-clark-on-america/2010/jul/13/subprimecrisis-buying-property-abroad">Mexicans Overtake Brits in the US Property Market</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Clark, Guardian (London), July 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Property prices have taken a well-documented dive in sunny US holiday hotspots such as Florida. But that hasn&rsquo;t encouraged many Brits back into the US homebuying market  &mdash;  in fact, the British have fallen behind Mexicans in the ranks of foreign property buyers in the US.</p>
<p>The National Association of Realtors&rsquo; annual study says the British accounted for 9% of overseas property purchases in the US during the year to March  &mdash;  a fall from 10.5% the previous year.</p>
<p>That means Britain dropped from second to third place in terms of foreign homebuyers in the US, behind Mexico which accounted for 10% of purchasers. And if present trends continue, British buyers will soon be overtaken by the Chinese, who are only a whisker behind. Canada is easily top of the table, accounting for 23% of international home purchases.</p>
<p>No doubt the weak British economy is largely to blame. There aren&rsquo;t too many people who feel affluent enough to splash out on a holiday home just at the moment. In the wake of America&rsquo;s subprime mortgage fiasco, it&rsquo;s also become much harder to get a homeloan as an overseas buyer  &mdash;  banks such as Lloyds TSB and Bank of America used to offer easy-to-access capital. Deals with low deposits are now off the table and buyers often have to stump up 30% in cash. The NAR found that 34% of foreign buyers had been unable to complete purchases because of financing problems.</p>
<p>Average prices across the US continue to fall  &mdash;  the median amount paid by an international buyer dropped from $247,100 to $219,400, pushed down by a glut of bank-owned foreclosed property. Yet the total value of foreign purchases rose from $39bn to $41bn.</p>
<p>By far the most popular US state for British buyers is Florida  &mdash;  and when I visited the Orlando area back in March, gloomy stories were in abundance about negative equity and plummeting home values. In the hinterland of Disneyworld, a local British pub, Harry Ramsbottom&rsquo;s, was up for sale due to a lack of UK business. Perhaps it&rsquo;ll be replaced by a Mexican tequileria.<br>

		<p>Part of the reason Orlando values are dropping like a stone is due to it&rsquo;s large and rapidly growing black population. Of course, i doubt foreigners are educated enough to understand the need to look up demographics before buying a house.</p>

		<p>This is consistent with cases that I have been working as a Census Enumerator doing the NRFU  &mdash;  VDC operation (Non Respondent Follow Up  &mdash;  Vacant Deletes Confirmation operation currently underway. Translation:  &#8220;Scraping the Bottom of the Barrel Problematic and Doubtful Dregs of the Remaining Housing Units Operation&#8221;</p>
<p>Apart from the expected crack houses, fleabag rooming houses of various characteristics, and other oddball living quarter arrangements, we have discovered almost newly built houses in Acorn-HUD crap mortgage loan hoods with Chinese Buffet restaurant owners filled (ie 12 occupants in a reasonable max 4 occupant house) with Mexican and Guatemalan &#8220;sleeping shift&#8221; indentured illegal alien servants who work 80 hours a week woking rice for $2.00/hr plus housing in a $6.00 all you can eat Chinese Buffet greasy spoon.</p>
<p>Think about that the next time you find yourself wondering &#8220;How do they do it? whilst dining &#8220;Chinese&#8221;</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be as concerned with some cases of Mexican nationals buying properties in the US.  They are frequently wealthy and white.  </p>

<p>That may be true in Border states and a few other select areas of the country, but for the most part here on the East Coast, it&rsquo;s poor Meztizos buying property in marginal hoods and filling up 2-3 BR houses with 6-10 people and raising barnyard animals in the back yard.</p>

		<p>Try buying a house in Mexico, gringo.  A whole different story.  It&rsquo;s basically impossible for middle class types to buy real estate in non-western countries the way foreigners buy our land.  I&rsquo;ve never seen a scintilla of gratitude for this, and more to the point, morality is reciprocal, so I say we start treating their investors the way they treat ours.  It&rsquo;s enlightening, doing a little research into investing in non-western countries, all Americans should try it.</p>

		<p>In all fairness Svigor, most other countries today didn&rsquo;t gain their &#8220;real estate&#8221; by exterminating the Native American Indians and forcing them off onto a few tiny reservations.</p>

		<p>RE: Poster 6 </p>
<p>You are quite correct. In the case of Hernan Cortez, the territorial conquest of Mexico was a Blitzkrieg of looting and raping and total domination over huge swaths of land over a short period of time with the ensuing creation of &#8220;La Raza Cosmica&#8221; Cortez had no time for &#8220;family values&#8221;  &mdash;  no Spanish women and children allowed on his boats. Women and children could only slow to looting activities down The results were still the the same in the broad generic sense of the word  &mdash;   Destruction of the indigenous population.  At least the Northern European colonization of North America (due to absence of gold for the taking) was gradual and measured.</p>

<p>This is a liberal anti-white myth that needs to be shattered.  You mean to tell me that everyone else in the world is in the exact place they were living when the first humans appeared?  Obviously that is impossible.  Every country currently exists due to one group coming in and taking over another&rsquo;s land.  That is the way the world works.</p>
<p><br>
Why is it that white people are uniquely held accountable for anything bad in the world?  Why is it that anything good whites have done has to be attributed to other races all the time?  You see the pattern?  I guess as a white person I should be flattered.  This only shows that we are to be held to a higher standard than everyone else.</p>
