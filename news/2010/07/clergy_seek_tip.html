<h1>Clergy Seek Tips on Immigration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yonat Shimron, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), July 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Many North Carolina clerics are raring to tackle immigration reform.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why some found United Methodist Bishop Al Gwinn&rsquo;s address Thursday lacking.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The clergy assembled for the breakfast meeting  &mdash;  mostly fellow Methodists, but also Baptists and Roman Catholics  &mdash;  are already supportive of illegal immigrants and ready to advocate on their behalf. They wanted more practical tips on how to do so.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A majority of religious groups support legislation that would allow the nation&rsquo;s estimated 11 million illegal immigrants to remain in the United States. Yet they face a buzz of populist opposition in an election year.</p>
<p>So strong is the opposition that Chris Liu-Beers, an associate with the N.C. Council of Churches, said he feared the General Assembly might consider a law similar to one recently passed in Arizona, which requires law enforcement officers, while enforcing other laws, to question a person&rsquo;s immigration status if officers have a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the country illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One, the Rev. David Haley of Winstead United Methodist Church in Wilson, suggested the populist revolt against immigration is not well-understood.</p>
<p>&#8220;The anger we&rsquo;re speaking about is smokescreen for a larger issue, and that&rsquo;s fear,&#8221; Haley said. &#8220;Those terrorists just walked across the borders and crashed those planes into buildings.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said one way to defuse that fear was for churches to invite illegal immigrants to worship and fellowship together. In his own congregation, Haley said he helped an illegal immigrant with some money and supplies. Later, she and her children started attending the church.</p>

		<p>These are the sorts of churches that are currently hemoraging membership. If you look at the very liberal Protestant churches as well as the Catholic church you will see that they are rapidly losing members to the more fundamental and back to the Bible Charismatic, non-denominational and Pentecostal churches. The more conservative Baptist groups are also seeing an upswing in membership. People are wising up and becoming tired of having social justice rammed down their throats at every service instead of teaching personal responsibility. I grew up in one of the largest United Methodist congregations in the country and they have become more and more liberal through the years. It is not expressly stated in the Bible but certainly implied that you are to follow the laws of the country in which you reside (render unto Caesar&hellip;) which the illegals are clearly not following. </p>

		<p>I suspect this article&rsquo;s author supports immigration restriction.  For he or she uses &#8220;illegal immigrant,&#8221; not a favorite phrase of the left, and implies that immigration restriction is the &#8220;populist&#8221; way to go during these times.</p>

<p>And later on she brought in all her relatives and their children and their friends relatives and so on until the church was ninety percent Mestizo and they decided to fire the minister and replace him with &#8220;someone who looked more like them.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Figuring out how to talk about things in a particular way is difficult, particularly when opponents seek to disparage the narrative outlined by supporters of controlled immigration and assimilation.</p>
<p>Spokespeople must remember the left&rsquo;s principal technique (second only to name-calling) is known in their circles as &#8220;clock-starting.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s the technique for starting your explanation and argument in the most advantageous way to your side.</p>
<p>In this case, the best date to start the narrative supporting controlled immigration and assimilation is May Day 2006.  That&rsquo;s the date when tens of thousands of illegal and legal immigrants chose to march through our major cities with a very loud and threatening message demanding that the USA be separated into two nations, one speaking English and one speaking Spanish.</p>
<p>Remind listeners that much of the civil rights efforts in the sixties and seventies was to end a situation which featured two nations, one black and one white, in the USA.  Now we are confronted with an aggressive claim to create two nations based on culture and language.</p>
<p>If anyone argues with this proposition, any search engine will unearth enough remarks and pictures to remind everyone that May Day 2006 was a demand for two nations in our country with separate flags, separate languages, and separate cultures.  It is amazing that the demands of May Day 2006 have not been characterized as blatant separatism which is exactly what it is.</p>
<p>Since that day, not one spokesperson for the two-nation crowd has rebuked or denounced the separatist rhetoric and flags on display.</p>
<p>Remind listeners that sometimes America is a little slow, but it is clear to this observer that the May 2010 laws passed in Arizona were nothing more nor less than an answer by a unified state opposing separatism and the two-nation claim.  Arizona is entirely justified by posing its answer to the claims of May Day 2006 after four years of study and reflection.</p>
<p>Think about the horrors of two nations in one country.  Belgium with Dutch and French cultures and languages. Israel with Arab and Jewish cultures and languages. Canada with French and English cultures and languages.<br>
Serbia with Christian and Muslim cultures.  Do we want to learn the lessons every other country has had to learn when it allows separatism?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about as good a narrative possible, placing the blame on riotous marchers on May Day 2006 for making wild claims for separatism, and Arizona finally and patiently responding four years later in May 2010.</p>

<p>I think that is a mighty fine idea.  So their congregations can get a really good and up close look at the beliefs of people south of the border.</p>

<p>This is usually the case. Or eventually the church will split into Spanish (of whatever language) and English congregations. Also the Spanish speakers will become so aggressive or cold to the English speakers that it will dive them out and then they can appoint their own pastor like you said. </p>

		<p>Sadly, most Christian groups in this country have devolved into self-hating purveyors of self-inflicted martyrdom.  They derive status from ostentatiously &#8220;forgiving&#8221; people who hate them and groveling with showy humility before those who would love nothing better than to see them disappear.</p>
<p>Christianity wasn&rsquo;t <i>always</i> a flabby spiritual wet sponge, and unless it somehow stops its <i>flagellante</i> march to the edge of the cliff, the next generation won&rsquo;t find it relevant enough to be worthy of attention at all.</p>

		<p>Jesus said &#8220;give unto Caesar what is Caesar&rsquo;s.&#8221;  What he meant was that your religious life should be separate and apart from political life.  Immigration laws are purely political.  Christian religious groups who are actually following the teachings of Christ should not be sharing an opinion.  If your church is getting involved in this issue, then it is not a true Christian church.  This is an issue which has nothing to do with religion.  Conversely, if an illegal walks into a church seeking religious guidance, then, according to Jesus, they should receive it without rancor.  The Church is NOT supposed to be political. </p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s greatest fear was that his church would become political.  Any church that engages in politics in not a true Christian church, period.  </p>

		<p>As an atheist, I obviously don&rsquo;t believe in any gods. But let&rsquo;s use a hypothetical and say that a god exists. I don&rsquo;t think this god would want religious leaders getting involved in politics, as their job is to be an advocate for religion, not social change. I could imagine that this god would feel insulted that others are using their position as religious leaders to divert attention away from the religion and direct it towards secular affairs.</p>

<p><br>
This comment is a bit muddled and warrants explanation. What these people mean by &#8220;religious groups support legislation&#8221; is that the LEADERS of these groups support the legislation. They view themselves as the OWNERS of their denominations and the members as peons to be told what to think. They know full well that their members don&rsquo;t support it. And that&rsquo;s where the &#8220;populist opposition&#8221; comes in. The &#8220;populist opposition&#8221; includes many members of their congregations. And the religious leaders are looking for a way to ram their baloney down members&rsquo; throats.</p>
<p>This is where the MEMBERS have to step up to the plate. First, they need to find out what kinds of tricks the &#8220;leaders&#8221; of their denominations are pulling. Then they need to do a &#8220;grass roots&#8221; flanking maneuver around the leadership. Form denominational and interdenominational organizations dedicated to ousting the bad clergy. Then they need to start with-holding their money from denominations pulling these stunts and giving it to the ones supporting their interests. If they don&rsquo;t then they&rsquo;re denominations are going to be hi-jacked by feel-good hippies in frocks.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more! I quit going to church many years ago because the gospel they preach is not the Gospel that I knew.</p>
<p>Notice how they also seem to defend ALL nonwhites and how they promote adoptions from 3rd world nations, mainly Africa? I can also remember when Christianity used to be called a WHITE mans religion. Too bad, it is anything but, nowadays.</p>

<p>The true attributes of God, however, are not delineated by any of us, whether we&rsquo;re believers or nonbelievers. This is evident by the fact that people of different religions as well as people within the various groups associated with those religions attribute different (oftentimes contradictory) traits to God. All they&rsquo;re doing is creating a god after their own image. <br>

<p>I was lucky enough to overhear a conversation the other day by another member of my Lutheran church. He grew up in California and talked about how California has changed. Besides the crime, he said, the huge, beautiful Lutheran churches that were built several decades ago to accommodate thousands of worshipers have so few people that they could probably fit in a Sunday School room. The Lutheran church simply cannot compete with the Catholic church in California&rsquo;s new demographics. </p></i></p>

<p>The Lutheran Church is behind bringing in tens of thousands of Somalis and assorted 3rd world &#8220;refugees&#8221; whom they dump on White towns and White taxpayers. Look what they did to Lewiston, Maine.  They are as bad as the Catholic Church at doing this and are cohorts of the Catholic Church. Many Protestant churches have joined the bandwagon also.</p>

<p>How is that interpretation &#8220;nonsense.&#8221;  To me, and many, many others the message of Jesus is that your spiritual, Christian life is separate from your political life.
