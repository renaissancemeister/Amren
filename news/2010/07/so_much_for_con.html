<h1><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0710/40007.html">So Much for &#8216;Conversation&rsquo; on Race</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Smith, Politico, July 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The election of Barack Obama, America&rsquo;s first black president, was supposed to be a sign of our national maturity, a chance to transform the charged, stilted &#8220;national conversation&#8221; about race into a smarter and more authentic dialogue, led by a president who was also one of the nation&rsquo;s subtlest thinkers and writers on the topic.</p>
<p>Instead, the conversation just got dumber.</p>
<p>The America of 2010 is dominated by racial images out of farce and parody, caricatures not seen since the glory days of Shaft. Fox News often stars a leather-clad New Black Panther, while MSNBC scours the tea party movement for racist elements, which one could probably find in any mass organization in America. Obama&rsquo;s own, sole foray into the issue of race involved calling a police officer &#8220;stupid,&#8221; and regretting his own words. Conservative leaders and the NAACP, the venerable civil-rights group, recently engaged in a round of bitter name-calling that left both groups wounded and crying foul. Political correctness continues to reign in parts of the left, and now has a match in the belligerent grievance of conservatives demanding that hair-trigger allegations of racism be proven.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a kind of heightened racial consciousness that&rsquo;s very worrisome. It&rsquo;s not good for us, it&rsquo;s not good for the very fabric of American society,&#8221; she [Abigail Thernstrom, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights] said, objecting in particular to the claims of racism against the tea party movement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the way race plays out all too often these days  &mdash;  as soon as the accusation of racism is made, good will, the benefit of the doubt, presumption of innocence all go out the window. It&rsquo;s seen as a virtue to jump to the least charitable conclusion when the issue is race  &mdash;  those who reserve judgment are accused of naivete or complicity,&#8221; he [Richard Ford, a law professor at Stanford and author of &#8220;The Race Card: How Bluffing About Bias Makes Race Relations Worse.&#8221;] said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The recent public flaps &#8220;tell us that all the talk about post-racialness aside, the race question is still a burning question in American life. People will use it in all sorts of different ways. But it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me,&#8221; said Harvard Law School Professor Randall Kennedy, author of &#8220;Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The headlines about Race now all seem in our favor.</p>
<p>Finally, Race is on White America&rsquo;s mind like it hasn&rsquo;t been since our temporarily suspended struggle against black domination. Now we seem to be awakened by a Thug Obama black president.  Good for us. Wish I had voted for the black guy so I could take partial credit for the rising wave of Race Reality Awareness amongst White Humanity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve learned that our being forced to endure Civil Rights, Affirmative Action, and Multicultural Diversity was based on lies and more lies.</p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t want Equality of Opportunity. They want unearned Race Privilege, and we were once ignorant enough to give it to them. </p>
<p>No longer. We just can&rsquo;t afford to destroy ourselves for a lie any longer, and we won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I am very hopeful for the future. I agree with James Edwards that we will break up into Ethnostates. Between now and then, racial animosity and violence will get so bad, White Liberal Elites will become universally recognized as idiot race traitors.  We will come together to protest any business or institution that employs them.  We will boycott them and force them to flee to their beloved African angels.</p>
<p><br>
Re FoxNews, our instinct is to mistrust them as neoconservative shills, but at least they report stories that stoke White anger and resentment.  Let them be shills as long as they are doing at least a little bit of the Lord&rsquo;s work in our favor.</p>

<p>Analysis: Race issues beset Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;post-racial&#8221; presidency</p>
<p><br>
WASHINGTON | Wed Jul 21, 2010 6:12pm EDT </p>
<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Many supporters of Barack Obama hoped his election as America&rsquo;s first black president might herald an era of post-racial politics, but race has been an issue his administration just can&rsquo;t seem to avoid.<br>

		<p>It is useless to try to have dialog. Dia-log means both parties speaking. Each party listening to the other.</p>
<p>These confrontations for dialog turn into the black repeating endlessly recriminations and not even allowing for retort! Recriminations and diatribe galore directed at whitey, NEW Black Panther Party style. Maybe even some rap tossed in too.</p>

The national media takes pains to ignore the Amren conference,  which regularly hosts experts on race, and then complains that the national conversation is &#8220;dumb&#8221;.</p>
<p>It then praises Obama, who never wrote anything on race worthy of repeating, as a &#8220;subtle thinker and writer&#8221;.</p>
<p>If the conversation is &#8216;dumb&rsquo;, it is because non-conformist ideas about race are being censored.</p>

		<p>Translation: the election of an explicitly anti-White mulatto &#8220;black&#8221; President of dubious national origin has AWAKENED many slumbering Whites.</p>
<p>Whites finally realize the liberal policies use their hard-earned tax money to fund welfare and Section 8 criminals, illegitimate non-White babies, and anti-White affirmative action programs.</p>
<p>Whites have had enough, so now the Democratic Party and the anti-White political coalition is deathly afraid of a massive WHITE VOTING BLOC.  Therefore, they desperately try to use the &#8220;racism&#8221; card, when it has mostly lost its potency. Liberals don&rsquo;t even realize that they further erode its potency by using it to describe anything that opposes liberalism!</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not racist, you just say that because I&rsquo;m White.&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Racist is a way to get a White person to shut up.&#8221;<br>
&#8220;There is nothing racist about asserting White rights, the NAACP and La Raza do this every day for blacks and browns.&#8221;<br>
&#8220;You are the real racist  &mdash;   you want White genocide, and you want to fund this White genocide with White taxpayer money.  We&rsquo;ve had enough!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Only liberal elites pretend that race isn&rsquo;t a core issue in American society.  Their rarified, ivory-tower existences allow them to ignore the conflicts on the ground.  They demand that the common people do what they themselves would never do.  <br>
Anyone who thought that Obama&rsquo;s election would create some sort of post-racial utopia is a fool.  The fact that we have a black President elected by 95% of the black vote but only 44% of the white vote is a recipe for inter-ethnic trouble.  And, just as many predicted, Obama has poked whitey in the eye almost from day one.  I just hope all whites are paying rapt attention.</p>

<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t find the heightened racial consciousness of whites &ldquo;very worrisome&rdquo; at all; nor, do I find the loony thugs&rsquo; in the Obama administration or his enraptured ideological paramours in the Marxstream Media&rsquo;s charges of &ldquo;racism&rdquo; against the tea party movement, anything but welcome. Personally, I hope both accelerate until the white majority of this country adopts a position of tenacious racial solidarity, and demands that institutionalized multiculturalism is dismantled and criminalized, and the United States are returned to a minimum of an 85% white majority. </p>
<p>I do not want to live in a &ldquo;multicultural civilization&rdquo; or on a &ldquo;post-racial borderless planet,&rdquo; because it never has worked in the past and it cannot now. I want to live in a world where racially directed commonsense and sanity, have totally replaced Communist delusions as the only viable socioeconomic-political system. </p>

		<p>You can&rsquo;t have a dialogue when the parties involved have a totally different understanding of what the word means. To the Holder/Obama/Wright crowd it means we are always right; we scream and you all suck it up. Next step is for whites to open up their checkbooks yet again as the logical  follow up. Words mean different things to different people.  </p>

		<p>A true conversation of any sort involves a give and take of ideas.  it involves talking and LISTENING.  Unfortunately this doesn&rsquo;t happen much. The politically correct side only wants to lecture and perhaps listen to our mea culpas. There needs to be dialogue with real listening on both sides. We have not yet achieved this.</p>

		<p>The only people who really thought Barack Obama&rsquo;s election was &#8220;redemptive&#8221; and &#8220;transformational&#8221; were the ones who&rsquo;ve been falsely accusing America of being a blatantly racist country for decades.  </p>
<p>It used to be that racism required an action by a racist   &mdash;   job discrimination, lynching, denial of public facilities.  Now racism is blamed for AIDS, unwed parenthood, educational failure and intra-racial crime, that whites can&rsquo;t really do anything about.  Have whites become so skilled that they can practice discrimination by telepathy or osmosis?</p>

		<p>As proof that Amren boosts White IQ by 10 points per day, I just had an insight that must have been synoptically generated by reading what Jared Taylor says about race.</p>
<p>My gift to you, and an automatic 10 point gainer just by reading this comment.</p>
<p>Join me in an exercise of acting stupidly as we increase the intensity of our dangerous discoveries.</p>
<p>(And don&rsquo;t you just want to turn off FoxNews every time the blackish mulatto Juan Williams with the bad mustache starts talking liberal nonsense? Could be worse- he could be White.)</p>
<p>All this Race News about Obama, from Rev. Wright to the current USDA mess, all the way through whatever is current at the beginning of the presidential primaries in 2012, plays to our favor.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s supporters will want to say his trailing in the polls, losing the primaries, and being relegated to a failed one term, are based on &#8220;White Racists Who Just Can&rsquo;t Tolerate Change and Transformation for the Better&#8221;.</p>
<p>But, but, but, the Race News all shows that Obama is a knee jerk black racist, so the charges of racism against us won&rsquo;t stick.</p>
<p>Glenn Beck is doing a good job of inoculating Whites from the Racism Smear.</p>
<p>Whites won&rsquo;t be intimidated by for the sake of the blacks next time, which means we are witnessing an historic sea change of race relations.  Think about how free we may become after 2012 when Whites universally come together and proclaim our first historic and transformative black president was the second worse mistake to bringing them all here in the first place.</p>
<p>Soon, and thanks to Obama, we will sing in unity, &#8220;Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, White Humanity is free at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Subtlest thinker and writer on the topic?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense!  Has this Smith character been living in a cave?  It has been proven unequivocally that Bill Ayers wrote most of the text in the community organizer&rsquo;s books.  All Obama&rsquo;s records, and writings, if he has any, have been hidden since this character entered politics in preparation for running for president.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t sound as if he&rsquo;s proud of his writings or his academic record.  This community organizer was ushered into the presidency by no fewer than a thousand lies by the radical fools in the media. </p>
<p>&#8220;His&#8221; books reveal a troubled soul that can think of nothing but race and he reveals a distinct distaste for whites in general. </p>
<p>When he first was nominated over Hillary, I wrote on this site that a person who has been a community organizer most of his adult life, while sitting in the pews of Jeremiah Wright with  his racist congregants, does not want to be president to bring the country together.  His entire purpose of advancing blacks and black causes isn&rsquo;t going to change just because he&rsquo;s elected president.  He wants that forum in order to pursue his black agenda.</p>
<p>Too, I think Rush is right, he wanted to run the country, because he hates it in order to have an opportunity to get even with whitey and to denigrate a country he saw as nothing but an  oppressor nation to all non-whites throughout history, especially blacks.</p>
<p>It was very apparent to a lot of us from the beginning he was damaged goods, and I&rsquo;m exasperated that more whites did not have the perceptive ability to see the same things.  It&rsquo;s a situation almost like the ones reported in Amren newsletters where too many settlers in the beginning wanted to show good faith to the Indians while, all along the tribes had a plain to slaughter every white in the earlier colonies.  It was nearly the same with the Boers against the blacks in Africa who chose to trust the blacks and were slaughtered unmercifully for their do-gooderism. </p>
<p>The question of why so many whites are beset with do-gooderism has been asked many times, but there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a satisfactory answer to the problem so far.  Altruism might explain some of it, but why are some whites so foolish as to jump up with great eagerness everytime a black pretends he wants nothing but to get along, then he reveals some kind of devious agenda that many of these same people still can&rsquo;t seem to see?  Take note that 37% of whites still approve of the way this incompetent fool is running the country.</p>
<p>We had better get rid of these gullibles if they don&rsquo;t wise up, because it does no good to progress in the future if we fall victim to non-white schemes every time they go into devious mode and too many people are unable to discern the truth or at the very least show a super-healthy skepticism.</p>

Race conversation in Middle Georgia:  Blacks without much money vote for tax increase on Whites who have money to spend.</p>
<p>Whites have been fleeing Macon for the lower taxes of the county, and now that the race tax is exposed, even more will follow.  </p>
<p>Let the blacks finish turning Macon into Detroit South so that we can see what the Civil Rights Struggle was all about.</p>
<p>We are atoned for slavery and segregation by persistent black failures and pathologies. We owe them nothing but a boat ride back to Ghana.</p>

<p>Although the penny tax had starkly divided city and county leaders, the city limit is not what divided voters. Instead, the vote seemed to fall along racial and party lines. Majority-black precincts, and those where at least 80 percent of votes were cast in the Democratic primary, supported the special purpose local option sales tax.</p>

		<p>Conversing about race this morning on MSNBC, Pat Buchanan remarked that Sec. Vilsack&rsquo;s televised apology yesterday was &#8220;fulsome&#8221; and I thought him misspoken.  But not so!  The &#8220;American Heritage Dictionary&#8221; (second college edition) reads:  3.  Archaic.  Copious or abundant in supply.</p>
<p>Was Pat&rsquo;s ambiguity calculated?  His language is circumspect and precise.</p>
<p>(Oh, yes.  Why do bloggers use &#8220;fail&#8221; as a noun?  Is there a cultural reference of which I am unaware?)</p>

		<p>I am pleased by most of what &#8216;Glamour Girl&rsquo; said in post #4, but this remark worries me somewhat: </p>
<p>&#8220;Re FoxNews, our instinct is to mistrust them as neoconservative shills, but at least they report stories that stoke White anger and resentment. Let them be shills as long as they are doing at least a little bit of the Lord&rsquo;s work in our favor.:&#8221;</p>
<p>You are right on the mark, about Faux News being a nest of poisonous, nation-wrecking, nation-bankrupting, bloodthirsty psychopaths and war mongering neo-cons.  That network is a mouthpiece and propaganda organ for a foreign nation and does in no way represent the best interests of traditional white America.  I suspect that what the connivers on Faux News are doing by suddenly deciding to report on stories that stoke &#8216;White anger&rsquo;, is to herd the white numbskulls who voted for Obama back over to the GOP side of the political fence, and the current GOP is a neo-con infested party - and these war mongering snakes are desperate to get back into power, so they can start World War 3 by attacking Iran.    Remember, Glamour Girl - the overwhelming majority of our combat troops are white - and they have already suffered the overwhelming majority of the deaths and injuries from these illegal wars that these same neo-cons lied our nation into, with the willing and treasonous complicity of George W Bush and Dick Cheney.<br>
More white men will die, and even white female soldiers, too - if these neo-cons foist another one of their stooges onto the traditional conservative Republican party voters.   </p>
<p>Beware of the not-so-subtle and sinister agenda of the Faux News Network, friends.  These rats<br>
are NOT our friends, they are our mortal enemies.    These neo-cons are evil and they need to be rooted out of the GOP completely, or else - consider supporting a third party, such as the A3P orConstitution Party.   </p>

		<p> Notice how  liberals always bring up race. Even if it&rsquo;s very minor, they have to bring it up. It&rsquo;s sickening. Nobody is more keen on race than a liberal democrat.  They see a racist under every bed. They have to. That&rsquo;s a strategy to keep ignorant blacks in the Democratic camp. Too show them that they&rsquo;re on their side. Democrats quit representing white people a long time ago. The solution to this is that every white not vote Democrat. However, with the increasing immigration of non whites into our country, some red states will turn permanently blue, for example, Ohio, thus insuring Democratic victories in every national election.  I noticed O&rsquo;bama carried the formerly red state. Ohio may be the tipping point.</p>

		<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, there&rsquo;s nothing to talk about when it comes to race. I simply do not want to be around other races, blacks and Hispanics in particular. The more multi-racial a country is, the greater the probability of one group oppressing, dispossessing or exterminating one or more of the other races or ethnic groups in the same country. Non-whites hate us no matter what, therefore I do not want to be around those who hate me just because I am white, period.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s offensive.  All Saxons are created equal in their desire for liberty from tyranny and rule by consent.  That&rsquo;s where equality stops.  O&rsquo;Reilly then proceeded to act stupidly when he didn&rsquo;t punch the traitor in the face.</p>

<p>ARIZONA: Trinity Cathedral to host July 29 prayer vigil as part of immigration law protest</p>
<p>Injunction or no injunction, activists say they intend to rally<br>
By Pat McCaughan, July 22, 2010 </p>
<p>[Episcopal News Service] Local and national activists are planning an ecumenical prayer service at Phoenix&rsquo;s Trinity Episcopal Cathedral as part of a &#8220;Day of Non Compliance&#8221; on July 29, when Arizona&rsquo;s controversial immigration law is to go into effect. </p>
<p>The Rev. Canon Carmen B. Guerrero, canon for peace and justice ministries in the Episcopal Diocese of Arizona, a vocal opponent of the SB1070 legislation which aims to detain and deport undocumented persons, confirmed that the cathedral will host a 6 a.m. prayer vigil on July 29.</p>
<p>A coalition of community activists called for boycotts, civil disobedience and nationwide protests against the law at a July 21 press conference on the steps of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in downtown Phoenix.</p>
<p>They intend to demonstrate, even if a federal judge, who is scheduled to hear legal arguments July 22 against the law, grants an injunction preventing SB1070 from going into effect, according to a statement to the media.</p>
<p>&#8220;On July 29, we will not comply with unjust laws,&#8221; said former Arizona state senator Alfredo Gutierrez of Somos America, who called for civil disobedience at the office of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.</p>
<p>Somos America is an advocacy group for equal rights for immigrant communities in Arizona.  </p>

		<p>Some good comments here, as I would expect at this forum, but again I strongly urge a vital change in thinking: forget <i>racism</i>  &mdash;  there&rsquo;s no such thing, because in Establishment discourse it means any number of things. So it means <i>nothing</i>.</p>
<p>There is, however, plenty of &#8220;racism&#8221;, which is any though, word, or deed that acknowledges or contains a perceived and/or demonstrated difference between races, <i>or</i> any desire to exercise freedom of association, however personal or private, even unstated,  that considers race, whether or not based on lifelong personal experience, published statistical data, or a combination of the two, <i>or</i> any circumstance where statistical documentation indicates disparity in results of  performance and/or consequences of personal choices between races.</p>
<p>None of these obligates any private citizen to justify them. You and I don&rsquo;t owe anyone an explanation. It&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s business until you say it is how you feel about any group of people, however they might be classified, or by whom. Illustration: &#8220;What&rsquo;s wrong with you? Do you hate [insert group name here]? Correct answer: &#8220;None of your business, pal. And don&rsquo;t ever ask me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>I cringe whenever I hear or read any white say &#8220;I&rsquo;m not a racist, but&hellip;&#8221; There is no plainer signpost of an argument being lost before it&rsquo;s begun. </p>
<p>&#8220;Person concerned about being called &#8216;racist&rsquo;&#8221; = <i>loser</i>. Don&rsquo;t be that guy. Or gal.</p>

		<p>When it comes to this nonsense about the white man &#8220;atoning&#8221; for slavery a few thoughts come to mind:A)Black people LOVE slavery;they have it in their blood. It thrives in every black nation. Black chiefs giddily sold slaves to the white man. there is a story i read of some English officers travelling to Africa to persuade the big chiefs to stop the slave trade. The answer you can easily figure out! My slogan:&#8221;The white man BOUGHT a slave but the White man never CAUGHT a slave!!&#8221; B)Only a small fraction of whites ever owned slaves. slaves were brought in precisely to destroy the bargaining power of the white workers. Just like immigration. C)No race ever ever ever has done more to &#8220;take care&#8221; of another race;we could pay off the national debt in a decade with the astounding amount of money we &#8220;give&#8221; to the dear sweet african americans&hellip;and they hate us more ferociously every year. The more powerful they become the more demanding and less tolerant they are. If they dont treat us as slaves,well,its not far off!</p>

		<p>31 Oops:</p>
<p>I think your strategy is good for outward consumption.  If I were a politician or advising a politician who I knew was One Of Us on race, my party line on race would be something along the lines of this:  As whites, our only real obligation to non-whites is a relatively equal (can&rsquo;t be perfectly equal, we&rsquo;re human after all) chance at success based on your own merit.  We don&rsquo;t owe non-whites our kinship, and nobody has a human, civil or constitutional right to be liked by anybody else, either as individuals or in the collective.  As George Strait put it so bluntly, you can lead a horse to love, but you can&rsquo;t make him fall.  And just because you have a relatively equal chance doesn&rsquo;t give us the responsibility to overturn society and/or orient it in a bass-ackwards direction in order to assuage your failures, if you turn out to be a failure.  Also be mindful of the fact that equality of opportunity does not guarantee equality of outcome   &mdash;   we can&rsquo;t be blamed for the obvious racial differences that are (pick one): a result of the machinations of the deity of your choice / the result of a big damned cosmological Greek tragedy.  Either way, we can&rsquo;t do anything about it, except take the hands we&rsquo;re given.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think your strategy is good for outward consumption.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  thanks for the kind words, QD  &mdash;  and I mean that, having noticed that you&rsquo;re one of the better posters on the forum  &mdash;  but, respectfully, I must say you got it absolutely backwards.</p>
<p>I infer you think there&rsquo;s another &#8220;strategy&#8221; for &#8220;inward consumption&#8221; for us who refuse to accept  the unearned, good or bad (as Ayn Rand explained many years ago). No!  &mdash;  whatever happens outwardly should and will happen based on the internal liberation that I described above. It happens <i>inside</i> first, <i>then we act on it</i>. </p>
<p>Again, my point is this, and I cannot stress it too much: &#8220;racism&#8221; can mean any one of many things, so it means nothing. Am I a &#8220;racist&#8221;? Of course!  &mdash;  I don&rsquo;t accept the &#8220;Narrative&#8221; or the associated guilt that we&rsquo;re constantly reminded of (thus my chosen &#8220;handle&#8221;). </p>
<p>To clarify: Thanks for noticing that my strategy is good for &#8220;outward consumption&#8221;  &mdash;  but that&rsquo;s true <i>only</i> because it is, first and foremost, good for <i>inward</i> consumption. Everything else follows naturally.</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;m guessing the Latin means &#8220;to seem rather than to be&#8221;, coincidentally the inverse of the motto of my home state NC. Yes, I laughed.)</p>
<p>As far as being strident about belief, which is a fine thing, I intend the same. I&rsquo;ve been considering the &#8220;correct&#8221; response to the rude, irrelevant, and, yes,  <i>hostile</i> question &#8220;What are you  &mdash;  a &#8216;racist&rsquo;?&#8221; An appropriate response leaves plenty of room for making an impression. Here&rsquo;s how one might respond to different sorts of the &#8220;well-intentioned&#8221;:</p>
<p>-To an older, mostly courteous lady acquaintance: &#8220;Ma&rsquo;am, my thoughts on that are a personal matter that I don&rsquo;t think is appropriate for casual conversation.&#8221; This to be said calmly and politely while looking straight into the other party&rsquo;s eyes for a second or two, and lose the smile. Then, if situation permits, excusing yourself and moving away. I think the &#8220;stridency&#8221; there will be recognized.</p>
<p>-To a more-or-less-civil do-gooder stranger who chooses to intrude on a private conversation or confrontation involving you: &ldquo;None of your business, pal. And don&rsquo;t ever ask me again.&rdquo; Again with the unblinking stare for a second or two. Then ignore them.</p>
<p>-To a drunk, repeat offender, or &#8220;minority&#8221; with &#8220;&#8216;tude&#8221; who chooses to intrude on a private conversation or confrontation involving you: &ldquo;None of your [optional modifier here] business, [optional description of the offender]. And don&rsquo;t ever [optional modifier here] ask me again.&rdquo;   &mdash;  and again the direct stare for a moment  &mdash;  but then look them up and down too, then spit, and walk away. Believe me, this is simply borrowing an opposing team&rsquo;s playbook, from many years of observation. Of course, this assumes you&rsquo;re prepared to respond to violence.</p>
<p>And of course there are other situations, but they have their own appropriate responses. I think all these responses could be plenty &#8220;strident&#8221;.</p>

<p>I agree with you. All of you who seem to be under the impression that FOX news has the best interests of Whites at heart are delusional!</p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to know where all of this supposedly White racial awakening is taking place. To use one incident of neo-con lunatic blogger, Andrew Breitbart and a few thousand tea partiers marching on Washington D.C as proof that millions upon millions of Whites have developed a racial consciousness is sadly misguided. </p>
<p>In fact, I would argue that many Whites have either retreated or become indifferent to racial awareness and that dishonest, opportunistic knucklehads like Brietbart (what he did was so ignorant. It backfired like a boomerrang!)will actually do more to hinder the cause of racial awareness among Whites by driving away middle of the road Whites who tend to harbor a distate for cut throat politics, especially the dishonest kind that has been exhibited by Breitbart and others of his ilk.  </p>
