<h1><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/7896688/Riots-in-Grenoble-after-police-shooting.html">Riots in Grenoble After Police Shooting</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>London Telegraph, July 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The incident begun in the early hours of Saturday morning when rampaging youths stoned a tramway and attacked it with baseball bats and iron bars.</p>
<p>The gangs then set cars on fire and opened fire against officers. The officers returned fire.</p>
<p>Regional security official Brigitte Julien says no one was injured in the incident but one youth, in his twenties, was detained.</p>
<p>The riots came after the death of a Grenoble resident during a robbery in a nearby town.</p>
<p>Karim Boudouda, 27, was one of two men believed to have held up a casino, escaping with more than 20,000 euros (Â£17,000).</p>
<p>He was killed in a shoot-out with police following the robbery. Violence flared after his memorial service.</p>
<p>Mr Boudouda, 27, had three previous convictions for armed robbery. The other suspect escaped and is still on the run.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux was planning to travel to the town to monitor events.</p>
<p>The riot in Grenoble recalled civil unrest that exploded across France in late 2005 after two teenagers from a rough Parisian suburb died as they were fleeing police.</p>
<p>The deaths touched off almost three weeks of riots across the country, often in the rough suburbs that ring France&rsquo;s major cities.</p>
<p>These high-rise neighbourhoods, built in the 1950s and 1960s to house a growing population of industrial workers and immigrants, have become near-ghettos where unemployment is high, public services are poor, and resentment boils.</p>
<p>During the 2005 riots, some 300 buildings and 10,000 cars were burned, while 130 police and rioters were hurt.</p>
<p>Since then, unrest has flared often after residents have run ins with the police.</p>
<p>Police and government officials have a lingering fear that the poor suburbs could explode again because the underlying causes  &mdash;  high unemployment, few opportunities, drug trafficking and a sense of exclusion from society  &mdash;  have changed little.</p>
<p>Police unions have raised concerns about a rise in violent crime spurred by the recession and a resurgence of drug trafficking in some areas.</p>

		<p>There is a very easy solution here, deport them all.  But the reverse is done instead.  Why is it so, so hard to grasp the concept, only certain individuals can function in an advanced civilization.  Future generations will certainly have to address this issue.  Whites are running out of space and time to avoid certain issues. </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;ll teach&rsquo;em to bring assault rifles to a pistol fight&hellip;</p>
<p>Of course, maybe they have a point.</p>
<p>I mean, here they were, trying to upscale their crime out of the ghettos and then the cops just up and shoot one of their &#8216;pioneering business innovators&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be pissed too, it&rsquo;s not like the man hadn&rsquo;t displayed perserverance in his chosen vocation.  Maybe they could have just, you know, legged him.  That way he could have sued the State for cruel and unusual, kind of an E-for-Effort type reward for failing well.</p>
<p>Now, absent their symbol for upwards cultural mobility, the only way these poor blighted souls can afford bullets for their guns is to return to drug dealing (using, whatever).</p>
<p>Of course, what really bothers me is that it looks like, out of 15 total perps, there are at least 5 whites in that picture.  Which means that the sense of disenfranchisement as an entitlement to violence is spreading.  Either that or someone has gotten clever with the Photoshopping again.</p>
<p>France, gun ownership &#8216;even foreigners can have a revolver if they are over 18&rsquo;:</p>

		<p>I remember when the worst Grenoble faced was a jewel thief or two courtesy of the Jean Claude Killy late movie. I think it was called &#8220;Snow Job.&#8221;  Which also pretty much explains how it got to where its at today&hellip;</p>

<p>CRIME AND DRUG TRAFFICKING HAS BEEN RISING REGARDLESS OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION. Has been for decades. Don&rsquo;t try to blame this on the recession. I know they try to do so, but please don&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>This reminds me too of a similar &#8220;incident&#8221; that occurred maybe thirty years or so ago now. French police were in a car chase after some bank robbers. The bank robbers fled into the casbah [Muslim] area of Marseilles. The police stopped their pursuit and ventured no further. They said that to do so would meant their being mobbed and murdered in about thirty seconds or so. The cops gingerly approached the elders of the casbah and kindly asked if the the elders would help them in finding the culprits.</p>
<p>Never heard anything after that. Even thirty years ago they had the &#8220;no go&#8221; areas. French gangsters [whitey] too are in cahoots with the Muslim criminal element?</p>

<p>1. a lot of Arabs can pass for white</p>
<p>2. some of those &#8220;Arabs&#8221; born in France have French mothers</p>
<p>3. poor whites who live in the projects have no choice but to fit in and join them. It&rsquo;s necessary for their survival   &mdash;   sort of like the Stockholm Symdrome.  If you can&rsquo;t beat &#8216;em, join &#8216;em.</p>
<p>4. anyone can see who is the winning team.  The police and the authorities are weak.  The Muslim militants are strong.  It&rsquo;s natural that people want to go with a winner.</p>

<p>Note the language used by the &#8216;authorities&rsquo; in the above two examples. Providing the culprits with excuses for their foul behaviour along with a dash of &#8216;fear&rsquo;!<br>
The only way to deal with this sort of behaviour is to get the water-cannons out and start shooting!</p>

<p>  And yet with all this evidence of the instability of &#8220;diverse&#8221; societies, European and American elites are hell-bent to flood all their countries with more and more poor, ill-educated, criminally-inclined, non white immigrants. When will the madness stop  &mdash;   when Western countries have the same level of economic prosperity and societal breakdown as the Third World! </p>

		<p>I watched a show the other day about the crime problem in South Africa.  One white woman said her house had been burgled and/or home invaded 5 times, twice while she and her husband were home.  The worst that happened was him receiving two gunshots to his legs.  The house is now under the watch of a security service and has barred windows, an electric fence, a spiked fence, a burglar alarm, light and motion sensors, a guard dog, and even a barred, jail-like bedroom door.  One of the most chilling things about her narration was that she laughed and shrugged throughout the telling, like someone telling how she keeps her beloved Persian cat from digging beneath her prize roses.  I once heard another South-African white refer to a sexual assault with much the same airiness.  She casually stated, &#8220;When I was raped&#8221; (emphasis on the word &#8220;I&#8221;) she spoke as though all SA females can expect the same treatment, which they all just have to live with.  Both examples of such behavior are undoubtedly defense mechanisms in a situation where vastly outnumbered whites don&rsquo;t know what else to do.<br>
Americans, Europeans, and other white-majority nations are dealing with criminal non-whites in much the same fashion, even though we&rsquo;re still in the majority.  </p>

		<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t whites be rioting, or just plain british citizens of all striped, because this group went on a criminal rampage and then had a shoot-out with their own police?</p>
<p>The world truly is backwards now. The only thing that could straighten it out would be white criminals&hellip; When you think about it, no one would be up in arms defending &#8216;sex-offenders&rsquo; - the media manages to successful portray these deviants as almost always white - something that&rsquo;s far from true. </p>

<p>If this nonsense keeps up, European police forces will have no choice but to make announcement to the rioters like this one:</p>
<p>&#8220;Attention! This will be your final warning! For the next 10 minutes, we will be firing rubber bullets. After 10 minutes, we will be firing REAL bullets. Now return to your homes or face the consequences!&#8221; </p>
<p>Well, either that or undertake a deportation campaign almost as massive as the one the US Southwest needs. </p>

FTR, Grenoble was the site of 1968 Winter Olympics. Nowadays they are apparently hosting exciting international events of a different sort. </p>

<p>LOL.   I guess all persons who riot become automatically &#8220;youfs&#8221;.<br>
Therefore, even a 50-year old rioter would be politely referred by the press as a deprived &#8220;youf&#8221; who was  rioting out of frustration, exclusion, and lack of opportunity.<br>
  <br>
Isn&rsquo;t it nice to have such an understanding press?   </p>

		<p>The best police response to these &#8220;youths&#8221; rioting are rifles and sub-machineguns barking when fired on full auto. In other words, police should shoot to kill when these &#8220;ethnics&#8221; start burning down the city, and parade the bullet shattered bodies for the other ethnics to see. When they see hamburger that used to be a friends&rsquo; head or face, they will have no doubt what will happen to them if they riot. I would leave a rioter dead and without a face too if they try to burn my home, or harm my family in a heartbeat!</p>

Used to be that Grenoble was known for:<br>
#1. its university<br>
#2. its skiing</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s known for its crime and rioting.</p>
<p>What a change all that diversity has made!</p>

		<p>Correct, Anonymous; Grenoble used to be like Boulder, Colorado; a nice university town with good skiing.  Boulder was repopulated with lesbian vegetarian communists, while Grenoble received Algerians.</p>
<p>The jury&rsquo;s still out, but it seems Boulder got the better deal.  Vegans with nostril rings don&rsquo;t set cars on fire or shoot at cops.</p>
