<p>{snip} Eighteen of the poorest countries by GDP per capita are in Africa. That is not surprising given the famine and war that have racked the continent for the better part of the last four decades. Contributing to these hardships is that many of these countries were recently territories or protectorates of European nations.</p>
<p>The concentration of poverty and the lack of national productivity would have looked very different five decades ago. In the 1960s, China and India were relatively poor nations, with huge populations, low literacy rates, and tremendous untapped resources. {snip}</p>
<p>Most of the poorest nations in Africa do not have effective central governments due to instability and civil war. Corrupt officials at all levels bleed money from the economy, &#8220;redirecting&#8221; aid from the West and &#8220;taxing&#8221; whatever the country&rsquo;s immature industries produce on their own.</p>
<p>Many of Africa&rsquo;s nations are resource-rich. Some have taken advantage of it. Nigeria is one of the largest oil-producing nations in the world. Meanwhile, other African countries with significant natural resources, like the Democratic Republic of Congo, do not have access to the capital needed to create an infrastructure that could exploit its resources.</p>
<p>The greatest problem for many of these counties is that they have limited means to improve their financial conditions. Some do not have arable land, others have negligible deposits of metal, oil, or gas. Each one been perpetually poor. And with a few exceptions, there is only modest hope that their situations will improve in the decades to come. They must rely on whatever aid they receive from the West, and perhaps Russia and China. They are now and likely will remain the poorest nations.</p>
<p><b>20) Republic of Haiti</b></p>
<p>*Population: 9.2 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $11.5 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $1,338</p>
<p>The poorest nation outside of the African continent, {snip}.</p>
<p><b>19) Burkina Faso</b></p>
<p>*Population: 16.2 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $17.7 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $1,304</p>
<p>The infrastructure of this west African nation has been plagued by frequent droughts and several coups since the 1980s. This country&rsquo;s main export is cotton, which due partly to these intense droughts and heavy fluctuations in the industry, has been an unreliable cash crop.</p>
<p><b>18) Federal Republic of Nepal</b></p>
<p>*Population: 28.9 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $31.5 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $1,205</p>
<p>Land-locked and isolated, one-third of Nepal&rsquo;s GDP comes from small-time agriculture. Like Burkina Faso, the country has experienced much political instability over the past few decades. While the nation has significant potential for the development of a hydroelectric power infrastructure, this instability, coupled with the nation&rsquo;s propensity for natural disasters, has left this resource largely untapped.</p>
<p><b>17) Republic of Uganda</b></p>
<p>*Population: 33.4 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $36.9 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $1,195</p>
<p>Uganda has a great deal of potential with its vast natural resources, particularly precious metals and minerals. {snip} The underdevelopment of a mining infrastructure, as well as a general lack of industrialization, is largely due to large-scale civil unrest and international conflict with neighboring countries, {snip}.</p>
<p><b>16) Republic of Mali</b></p>
<p>*Population: 13.7 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $15 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $1,172</p>
<p>Another agriculture-heavy region, densely populated Mali relies heavily on its tobacco industry, which makes up at least 50% of total exports. {snip} In particular, the unpredictable and unreliable availability of utilities, including electricity, water and telecommunications has deterred foreign investors and hampered development.</p>
<p><b>15) Republic of Rwanda</b></p>
<p>*Population: 11,055,976<br>
*GDP (ppp): $9.9 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $1,149</p>
<p>{snip} Like several others on this list, this nation is rich in minerals. Efforts to develop this resource, aided by the international perception of increased stability after nearly 1 million deaths during the genocide, have caused mineral production to replace coffee and tea as Rwanda&rsquo;s main export.</p>
<p><b>14) Republic of Guinea</b></p>
<p>*Population: 10.3 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $10.3 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $991</p>
<p>Guinea retains significant potential in agricultural and mineral resources, as well as hydroelectric development, but a wide range of issues, including a literacy rate of less than 30% and political uncertainty, has left these industries underdeveloped.</p>
<p><b>13) Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia</b></p>
<p>*Population: 88 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $70.9 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $954</p>
<p>One of the largest and poorest of the African nations, Ethiopia relies heavily on agricultural exports (particularly coffee) to sustain GDP. Heavy droughts, poor farming practices, price fluctuations, and a two-year war with Eritrea hurt the industry, causing many coffee growers to switch to other crops. {snip}</p>
<p><b>12) Republic of Mozambique</b></p>
<p>*Population: 22 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $18.6 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $933</p>
<p>{snip} Working against massive foreign debt with the aid of international organizations, the nation has managed to garner some attention from investors and has developed a sizable aluminum industry. The growth and export potential of the aluminum industry has been hampered by a sharp drop in the price of the metal since the global economic recession.</p>
<p><b>11) Republic of Madagascar</b></p>
<p>*Population: 21.3 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $19.7 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $932</p>
<p>Until 1990, Madagascar had a socialist-oriented government, which was replaced by one which has relied heavily on the IMF for economic guidance. {snip}</p>
<p><b>10) Republic of Malawi</b></p>
<p>*Population: 15.4 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $11.3 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $884</p>
<p>{snip} high levels of poverty, HIV/Aids and corruption continue to burden Malawi, one of the world&rsquo;s most densely populated and least developed countries. In addition, the overuse of agricultural land  &mdash;  the nation&rsquo;s primary natural resource  &mdash;  has contributed to over half of the Malawian population living below the poverty line. There are plans for exploiting the country&rsquo;s uranium reserves.</p>
<p><b>9) Togolese Republic (Togo)</b></p>
<p>*Population: 6.2 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $5.3 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $826</p>
<p>Experiencing ongoing political unrest since gaining independence from France in 1960, Togo is considered to be one of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries. Led by the universally condemned President Faure Gnassingbe, son of the corrupt political leader Gnassingbe Eyadema, Togo has only recently begun to rebuild its relationship with the international community after years of human rights violations. {snip}</p>
<p><b>8) Republic of Sierra Leone</b></p>
<p>*Population: 5.2 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $4.3 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $759</p>
<p>Although rich in minerals and agricultural resources, Sierra Leone suffered a ten-year war, which ended in 2002. {snip} The export of diamonds, often called &#8220;blood diamonds,&#8221; benefits only a small minority of the country. {snip}</p>
<p><b>7) Central African Republic</b></p>
<p>*Population: 4.8 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $3.2 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $745</p>
<p>A site of constant political turmoil, the CAR has undergone three decades of bumbling military dictatorships, a decade of unruly civilian government, and an unstable transitional government established by a military coup. All of this has happened since gaining independence from France in 1960. There is great potential for economic growth within CAR&rsquo;s timber and diamond industries, however years of corruption and political instability have undermined this progress.</p>
<p><b>6) Republic of Niger</b></p>
<p>*Population: 15.9 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $10.1 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $719</p>
<p>{snip} These facts, in addition to Niger&rsquo;s prolonged history of post-independence military rule, keep the nation as one of the poorest in the world, devastated by disease and corruption.</p>
<p><b>5) State of Eritrea</b></p>
<p>*Population: 5.8 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $3.7 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $679</p>
<p>{snip} The country&rsquo;s single party government, run by the People&rsquo;s Front for Democracy and Justice, maintains total control over the economy through military force and the expansion of government-owned businesses.</p>
<p><b>4) Republic of Liberia</b></p>
<p>*Population: 3.7 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $1.4 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $424</p>
<p>As a result of years of civil war and a cycle of incompetent government administrations, Liberia has suffered extensive economic hardships since a 1980 military coup led by Samuel Doe. Fortunately, an abundance of water, timber, and mineral resources offer a chance for salvation for to the nation&rsquo;s war-ravaged infrastructure.</p>
<p><b>3) Republic of Burundi</b></p>
<p>*Population: 9.8 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $3 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $400</p>
<p>Having recently emerged from a civil war between the Hutu and Tutsi factions, Burundi&rsquo;s economy faces many challenges. It is landlocked, lacking in resources, largely uneducated (only one in two children attend school), and one in every fifteen adults has HIV/Aids. {snip}</p>
<p><b>2) Republic of Zimbabwe</b></p>
<p>*Population: 11.6 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $332 MILLION (note: whoa!)<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $354</p>
<p>One of, if not the poorest nation in the world, Zimbabwe&rsquo;s economy has suffered from war with the Democratic Republic of Congo and hyperinflation as a result of the overprinting of currency. A violent land redistribution campaign has scared away most potential foreign investors.</p>
<p><b>1) Democratic Republic of Congo</b></p>
<p>*Population: 70.9 million<br>
*GDP (ppp): $20.6 billion<br>
*$GDP Per Capita: $332</p>
<p>Although rich with economic resources, the Democratic Republic of Congo has suffered from war and corruption since its independence in 1960. Once the second most industrialized country in Africa, it now has in the lowest GDP per capita in the world. {snip}<br>

		<p>Paging Jared Diamond (the subversive scholar who continued the work of Franz Boas and Steven Jay Gould in repressing racial truth in favor of feel-good lies about environmental factors).</p>
<p>For the millionth time: environment can only LIMIT potential.  A black with an IQ of 70 cannot become a 140+ IQ rocket scientist even if he gets midnight basketball, free lunch, and a nice White man&rsquo;s mansion.  Beavers are not beavers because they are born near a beaver dam! </p>
<p>There is a reason why certain groups promote the idea of race mixing and racial equality, while totally avoiding these concepts in their own lives.  It is to:</p>
<p>(a) commit genocide the White gene pool</p>
<p>(b) subvert the political base to a brown, low-IQ mess that will too unintelligent and too busy fighting amongst its own various ethno-interest to wake up to massive tyranny</p>

<p>One thing that strikes me about so many of these poor African countries is how warlike thy are. It&rsquo;s not just that they&rsquo;re poor, it&rsquo;s that they are constantly fighting with each other. Ah, it&rsquo;s all due to white wickedness, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

		<p>All of the countries in the aforementioned article are kleptocracies but Africa is staggeringly rich in natural resources.The Chinese are up to their elbows in Africa now and the West must play catch up.Naturally with the country under it&rsquo;s current leadership they will blow it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Contributing to these hardships is that many of these countries were recently territories or protectorates of European nations.&#8221; Well, I think we can all spot the methodological howler here. In fact, those colonies which have most internalized European (British Imperial) values have done best - the former Raj now called India. Those who have rejected them have done worst. Saddest case is Ghana, which started out every advantage, and then under Nkrumah declined into corruption and dictatorship. The most famous example of success from British Imperial occupation is of course the United States.</p>

		<p>From James Watson, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA- &#8220;I&rsquo;m inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa&#8221; because &#8220;All our social policies are based on the fact that (African) intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really&#8221;</p>
<p>Shortly after saying this, he was shouted down by his opponents and bullied into recanting the above statement. Being that the poorest nations are all in Africa, it should be self-evident to any thinking person that the above quotes are fundematally true. But even with the obvious staring them in the face, liberals will still deny-deny-deny the obvios. </p>

		<p>Reason for poverty: low IQs. You know it, I know it, most social scientists know it (but ain&rsquo;t saying nothin). Is EQUALITY the objective? Easiest solution: dumb down the populations of the US, East Asia, and Europe. I mean, after all, the alternative  &mdash;  making the populations of lagging countries smarter  &mdash;  is not at all feasible&hellip;</p>

<p>Exactly! <br>
And it is the same as what they do in America but in smaller groups because their enemy the white man, is not fighting back as a group.<br>
Furthermore most of this wars are fights over land and resources. Both are getting smaller per person because our aid not make them live better or have better conditions but only have more kids. If they are one million starving whites and you constantly give them money, they will increase their lifestyle level after 10 years. If you give that money to 1 Million starving blacks you will have 5 Million starving blacks.</p>

		<p>These are simply stunning revelations.  To think that African countries rich in natural resources are among the poorest in the world! Why, we&rsquo;ve even seen the same thing here.  Once prosperous American cities have become veritable wastelands once black Africans reached certain numbers.  While it&rsquo;s far to early to identify any cause and effect, sociologists would do well to begin looking into this strange, albeit universal, phenomenon. It&rsquo;s possible, though entirely unproven, that there just might be some connection, however tenuous and even improbable.</p>

<p>Propagandists say they are starving because of drought, not because the productive white farmers being forced to give up the land to blacks. Don&rsquo;t believe a thing in the media when it comes to African excuses. Stick to sites like this &amp; learn the truth.</p>

		<p>It feels as though my head will explode when I read this kind of stuff.  Does anybody, even a brainwashed liberal, think this stuff makes sense?  The first paragraph says:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Eighteen of the poorest countries by GDP per capita are in Africa. That is not surprising given the famine and war that have racked (sic) the continent for the better part of the last four decades. Contributing to these hardships is that many of these countries were recently territories or protectorates of European nations.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Famine and war were a lot rarer when these countries were European colonies.  And they had capital and skills to develop their resources. When the colonial powers left, they left behind functioning economies and developed infrastructures.  Now they are blamed because those things have been destroyed.</p>
<p>There is only one humane policy for Africa, and that is quarantine.  Stop feeding them. Let Africa sink.</p>

		<p>Many of Africa&rsquo;s nations are resource-rich. Some have taken advantage of it. Nigeria is one of the largest oil-producing nations in the world. </p>
<p> Why are some countries that have few natural resources, like Japan and Germany, peaceful and prosperous, while resource rich African countries are chaotic and poverty stricken? Could it have something to do with the people who live in those countries? No, wait, Dr. Jared Diamond says<br>
prosperity/civilization is completely due to underground geological formations and not to any discredited and outdated socially constructed theories. </p>

		<p>Any black African country with its head even above water is one where whites still run commercial enterprises.  A few have given up all pretenses and leased farm lands to whites and Chinese.  Those who are handing everything over to the blacks are steadily going downhill, their GDP falling year by year.  <br>
India was no doubt the jewel in the crown of the British Empire because it had a populace with an average IQ above 70.</p>

<p>I am in complete agreement and have been thinking that way for years.  I wish the government of the United States had the courage and sense to do the same with welfare recipients, who are mostly black and hispanic, with some occasional white trash.  Cut off the benefits and watch the illegitimate births drop like a rock.  You&rsquo;d also see a lot of illegal Mexicans go home.  If our government hit employers who hire illegals with stiff fines and jail sentences, the jobs for them would dry up and many more illegals would go back to Mexico.  Blacks would either get a job, mooch off family members or simply perish as would the white trash.</p>
<p>I, for the life of me, do not understand why civilized countries continue to pour billions into Africa.  The blacks wanted to reclaim it and run everything after the Europeans brought the only civilization to Africa they every had when it was colonized.  I say let the blacks who want to run Africa do so and stand back, watch, and don&rsquo;t come to their rescue.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve recently seen an appeal on TV, from a probable NPO, that wants your money to purchase mosquito nets that will be freely distributed to the indiginous people of southern Africa.  Obviously the only people that need to be provided with these are going to be hard to educate about proper use, as they would make decent diapers but poor clothing.  They should also send one to a prominent MSNBC host whose love of all things African is pathetic.  </p>
<p>While they&rsquo;re at it, teach them how to dig wells, boil water and avoid that popular beach on the river where auntie, son, niece and sister-in-law disappeared. </p>

		<p>The funny thing is,<br>
every time there is a black country without natural resources the TV tells us it is  poor because of the lack of resources. But every time they talk about a black country which has many natural resources, the say that the people are hold poor because of (white) oppression thus the black never gain control over there resources.<br>
But however the fact is there and not denieable:<br>
White countries are rich no matter how many resources they have or haven&rsquo;t. And black countries are poor no matter what history or resources they have.</p>
<p>This is the main reason why I think whites will woke up. It is so logical and the excuses of liberals are getting more and more unbelievable so that even former liberals rethink what they see. </p>

		<p>Mosquito nets aren&rsquo;t exactly high technology-I can and have woven my own fine diamter fishing nets-a mosquito net can&rsquo;t be that much more difficult.also spraying of ponds and other mosquito breeding ares9how about introducing fish that will eat mosquito larvae etc,instead of sending vulnerable women/children to fetch water by a crocodile infested river;a half-split big diamtere bamboo type plant will funnel all the fresh water a village needs into a common holding pond in side a community for irrigation,drinking bathing etc.The said &#8220;pipe&#8221; is all-natural,clean disposable(burnt for firewood etc)-what&rsquo;s so  hard?</p>
