<h1><a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20100703/D9GNCLR80.html">Mexican Murder Suspect: US Consulate Infiltrated</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Morgan Lee, AP, July 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The drug-cartel enforcer told an unsettling story: A woman who worked in the Mexican border&rsquo;s biggest U.S. consulate had helped a rival gang obtain American visas. And for that, the enforcer said, he ordered her killed.</p>
<p>Nonsense, says a U.S. official, who said Friday the motive for the slaying remains unknown.</p>
<p>The employee, Lesley Enriquez, and two other people connected to the U.S. consulate in the city of Ciudad Juarez were killed March 13 in attacks that raised concerns that Americans were being caught up in drug-related border violence.</p>
<p>Jesus Ernesto Chavez, whose arrest was announced Friday, confessed to ordering the killings, said Ramon Pequeno, the head of anti-narcotics for the Federal Police. Pequeno said Chavez leads a band of hit men for a street gang tied to the Juarez cartel.</p>
<p>Enriquez and her husband were killed in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, as they drove toward a border crossing. Chavez also is accused in a nearly simultaneous attack that killed the husband of a Mexican employee of the consulate.</p>
<p>Pequeno said Chavez told police that Enriquez was targeted because she helped provide visas to a rival gang.</p>
<p>A U.S. federal official familiar with the investigation said Friday that after the killings, U.S. officials investigated possible corruption involving Enriquez and found none. The official was not authorized to speak about the case and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The official said the motive behind the killing remains unclear.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. Embassy officials previously said that Enriquez was never in a position to provide visas and worked in a section that provides basic services to U.S. citizens in Mexico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 23,000 people have been killed in Mexico&rsquo;s drug-related violence since President Felipe Calderon launched an all-out offensive against drug gangs in 2006.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The State Department, meanwhile, announced new travel restrictions Friday for U.S. government employees working away from the border in Mexico and Central America. As of July 15, they and their families are barred from crossing anywhere along Texas&rsquo; border, north or south, because of safety concerns. The U.S. government continues to urge Americans to exercise extreme caution or defer unnecessary travel to certain parts of Mexico.<br>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;. Hispanic and naturalized Hispanic citizens running our Embassys in Mexico and other Latin American countries, Hispanics in ICE, Border Patrol, etc.  Corruption?, what a ridiculous, far fetched idea. Clearly, the imaginings of a racist mind.</p>

<p>Since they&rsquo;re both liars, I&rsquo;m afraid I wouldn&rsquo;t believe either.</p>
<p>Both have bad reputation, and both have earned them.</p>

		<p>My trust in the U.S. federal government is such that I have no trouble believing the Mexican enforcer.  After all, this is the same federal government that tells us that the border is secure, so now we can have an illegal alien amnesty.</p>

		<p>Texans cross back and forth over the border, north and south.  Business ties, family ties, etc.</p>
<p>So it is too dangerous for the Federales of DC to cross the border, but not dangerous enough for Texans that we would need a good, strong fence to protect Texas and our babies.</p>
<p>But I forget.  The Federales LIKE to kill Texans.  One word: Waco.</p>

		<p>This should not surprise anyone that the cartels have infiltrated the consulate. Years ago now, the El Paso DEA counter-narcotics office found a bug placed by the cartels on their phone system. The cartels at will could tap and had evidently been tapping for sometime the phone system OF THE ENTIRE DEA OFFICE!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to infiltrate the cartels, THEY HAVE FOR A LONG TIME HAVE HAD YOU INFILTRATED!!</p>

		<p>Who do I believe, my own government or a Mexican hit man?</p>
<p>Easy; I&rsquo;ll believe the killer.  Unlike officials of my own government, Mexican thugs have not spent my entire adult life expecting me to believe whatever outrageous falsehoods they find it expedient to utter.  Moreover, Mexican hit men - judging by the level of violence along the border - are far more conscientious about how they do their work, and their bosses appear to expect concrete results, quite unlike the administrators of the alphabet soup plague of do-nothing government agencies the US taxpayer has been saddled with.</p>

		<p>They were obviously slain for a reason. If she wasn&rsquo;t dirty, then it was a coworker, boss etc and she was used as a message.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t random.</p>
