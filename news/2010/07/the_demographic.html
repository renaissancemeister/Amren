		<p>Why is this happening?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re being conditioned by the media around the White world to accept this.  We&rsquo;re being demonized if we attempt to fight back.  We can actually lose our jobs.  We&rsquo;d then have to worry about supporting ourselves.  Our governments have been taken over by a small group of people that want our destruction and are working night and day to see to it that we are destroyed.  </p>
<p>The Swiss are the quintissential Whites with blue eyes and blond hair.  They are the ones most targeted by the media and their handlers and controllers for extinction.  Seeing this video I must admit is very depressing.  Seeing a White Swiss girl walking almost hand-in-hand with, well, you know what with, is difficult to take.  It is so sad that Whites are literally letting these people take over their countries with almost no resistance whatsoever.  When I see this, I almost say to myself, &#8220;Does a people who let this happen without a fight deserve to survive&#8221;?</p>
<p>It is very difficult to have any respect for people who allow the beautiful society that they&rsquo;ve created, be destroyed so easily.  </p>

		<p>I am the creator of the video.  I have footage from other European countries and from Canada and the U.S., so more videos in this &#8220;Demographic Decline&#8221; series are coming.  The process of arranging and editing all the images and clips from Switzerland and trying to weave in a coherent narration was very time consuming (I had never made a Youtube video prior to a couple weeks ago).  But now that I know there&rsquo;s an actual audience for my observations, I&rsquo;ll be motivated to get the videos out sooner rather than later!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve established a blog where you can follow my work:</p>

		<p>What did the Swiss do to actually stop this? </p>
<p>The problem is the Westerners&rsquo; attitude. People just wait, sit and watch, people do nothing to stop this totalitarian nightmare of multiculturalism. <br>
I personally know many white people who actually act like if they were some kind of slaves for the Third Worlders. They help them all the time, they give them money. Many women feel so sorry for them that they actually marry them because of that reason!<br>
I personally am going to send e-mails to all the members of the European parliament and to all the members of my Polish parliament so that they know what is my opinion of this. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want even one non-white in my country!</p>

<p>This wikipedia entry says that nearly 1/5th of the population of Lucerne is comprised of foreigners, most of which are probably not white.</p>
<p>And then we have the wikipedia article below, which states that foreigners, most of which are probably not white, comrprise over 1/5th of the entire Swiss population.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really depressing to say the least. One of the anti-&#8220;racist&#8221; comments on the video (which was posted on YouTube, not AmRen), illustrates the mentality that many Westerners have that is leading to our inevitable extinction: that race does not exist; that race is only skin color; and that anyone who disagrees is evil.</p>

<p>This guy&rsquo;s evidence is anecdotal, but Charles Murray (Bell Curve) on his blog has said similar things, that in even a few years the non-White proportion of Paris shot way up. </p>

		<p>Very sad.  I wish I could be as optimistic as he is about the mountains and other natural features of the land.  Africans and South Asians, once they are allowed to breed freely, do not tend to be very good custodians of natural beauty.  As the Swiss gene pool becomes polluted, so too will their mountains and rivers.</p>

		<p>Switzerland must look ripe and juicy for the typical third worlder bent on exodus. It&rsquo;s a relatively prosperous and stable country and it already has a &#8216;multicultural&rsquo; tradition, in that half the country speaks German and half French and it also borders with Italy. </p>

		<p>I agree that these images are disheartening. I used to live in Germany and traveled to Zurich, Bern and Lucerne and loved the beautiful country of Switzerland. I often see videos of Germany as it looks today and it fills me with ache to see Europe transform itself into a Tower of Babel. Europe is a place that is close to my heart and what depresses me more than anything is not just the darkening of the continent; it&rsquo;s the fact that Europeans have lost their spirit and sheepishly allow it to happen. </p>

		<p>The extaordinary thing about this is that neutral land-locked Switzerland has no colonial baggage,nor is it a member of the Eurabian Union.Even by the addled standards of post-1945 european thinking,the decision of the Swiss authorities to fill their prosperous well-ordered land with economic migrants defies all rational analysis. </p>

		<p>Washington, D.C., the capital of our nation, is no better, and actually, much worse.  Last time I flew in, EVERY SINGLE PERSON I interacted with, from the ground transportation clerks, to the shuttle drivers, to the people manning the rental car kiosks, to those running the food concessions in the airport itself (Reagan National) were not only non-white, but clearly foreigners, mostly - I am assuming from their looks and accents -from eastern Africa or the the middle east.  I commented to my traveling companion that all locals must be otherwise employed.  But that is only part of the problem: with our nation facing terrorist threat from these parts of the world, why are they employed in the most vulnerable areas?  The West does indeed have a death wish.</p>

		<p>This is a fantastic video.  The narrator wasn&rsquo;t politically correct and he was concise and direct.  This is suicide by white folks who have allowed themselves to feel guilt and shame for building a great Western civilization.  They are literally allowing &#8216;payback&rsquo; and revenge by the weaker cultures that they conquered on their way to building the West.   </p>

		<p>I lived in Switzerland for over 15yrs!Living someplace and being a visitor taking movies is something quite different. Switzerland lets foreigners in but they don&rsquo;t try to be politically correct either&hellip;They voted for the banning of Minarets and the EU Council is trying to get them to change it but the Swiss won&rsquo;t budge. They also deport asylum seekers who have been rejected. There was a big stink recently about a asylum seeker from Nigeria who was killed during his exit from Switzerland. They found he had some medical problem. <br>
Also those from the former Yugoslavia (eastern Europeans) are some of the most guilty of crime. They are muslims too and the Balkan people have very little idea of &#8220;quality of life&#8221;&hellip;Now Switzerland will start to deport them as they have decided that the Balkans no longer pose a threat to its people. <br>
Also during the time this person shot this film is a big tourist time. You are going to see many people from different cultures during this time in Switzerland. Not to say there are no foreigners living there. But one thing I can say about Switzerland is that they &#8216;call a spade a spade&#8221; and they are not trying to be politically correct. When they want to get rid of a group of people they deport them. Then the UN starts their rant, but the Swiss do what they have to do. You know how hard it is to get citizenship in Switzerland? Most of those in this film probably if not visiting are waiting to hear about their asylum or have limited permits.<br>
Also you have to blame the decline in Whites population and the Social Security System which is nothing but a ponzi scheme. IF it weren&rsquo;t for that then White countries would not be taking in so many foreigners. Overall the Swiss are intelligent and keep the country up to par. Don&rsquo;t decide by a 6minute film&hellip;</p>

		<p>This is unexpected and depressing.  From my reading elsewhere on the web, I had the impression the Swiss were resisting, at least somewhat, the immigrant hordes.  I had also hoped their high standard of living (and the resultant high cost of living there) would deter the massive influx.  Your well-done video shows that&rsquo;s just not so.  I know the rest of Europe is even worse; Australia&rsquo;s pretty bad as well.  I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a single historically white nation that will remain in even 50 years&rsquo; time - your 100 year projection is far too optimistic.</p>

<p>This may seem kind of stupid, but whenever you&rsquo;re walking through a neighborhood, searching for a shortcut or whatever, it&rsquo;s always best to walk across someones yard near the border of two neighbors property. Each neighbor is likely to assume you&rsquo;re with the other party. The first order of business is too divide and conquer. A divided house will surely fall. </p>

		<p>Garrison,</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fool yourself.  It is impossible for there to be &#8216;payback&rsquo; for something you didn&rsquo;t do and the victim didn&rsquo;t suffer.</p>
<p>The problem is that non-whites assume that this &#8216;prejudice&rsquo; is somehow something that extends back to the various slave/colonial period days.  It isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pure and unadulterated desire, RIGHT NOW, not to be in their company.  And it&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to vote with our feet which is the standard for escaping a &#8216;racist or accomodationist&rsquo; scenario back to a white enclave with no more than 10% foreign ethnies.</p>
<p>As for why it&rsquo;s happening?  That should be obvious if you read Kevin MacDonald.  Whites actually have a very LOW explicit racism bias.  We have trained ourselves so specifically to pursue the truth independent of bias and indeed to -excel- based on individuality, that we are genetically and socially different from 90% of other ethnic groups which manage to integrate implicit (internalized/unconscious) racial preferences with explicit (trained) ones.</p>
<p>What happens when you are so locked up in your own view of what is good for your group vs. good for the society as a whole and your own pursuit of exploration, science and art?  You destroy the perfected inductive and deductive reasoning that in fact gives our culture things like universal moralilty and, unfortunately, social guilt.</p>
<p>This is why it is truly terrible that our leaders no longer even -attempt- to shield us from the kinds of competition that leads to racial hate.  We are killing the very open mindedness that makes us great.</p>

		<p>I can assure anyone who views it that this video is an accurate and well made picture of the situation.     Many thanks to the maker!   In fact, it is really quite mild. I could only criticize it for not showing ENOUGH.  Lucerne is a tourist-oriented town which does  not have so many immigrants as business/industrial cities like Zurich and Winterthur.  Or the &#8220;international&#8221; city, Geneva.  I have not been in Lucerne in several  years now, but I fondly recall the exact same scenes shown here. </p>
<p>I also recall sitting in the dining rooom of my hotel there, at breakfast, and observing through the window the parade of young students going into the school just down the street.  As best I recall, probably 2/3 of them were non-white. One couldn&rsquo;t help noticing that salient fact. Do the Swiss notice it too?  Is it mentionable?  Or are they (like other Europeans) blind to &#8220;racism&#8221;?   This will be the adult population of Lucerne in only another 15-20 years.  It&rsquo;s amazing to realize how fast populations can change!  Do the tolerant Swiss know what they are getting into?</p>
<p>But Lucerne is by no means the worst case.  Not at all!     Anyone riding the streetcar in Geneva will  almost think they are on the metro in Paris or the subway in New York.  Africa and Asia are all around you. Latin America too.  There are posters in the Geneva streetcars exhorting people to:  &#8220;Say &#8216;Yes&rsquo; to Diversity!&#8221;   <i>[Disons &#8216;Oui&rsquo; a la diversité!]</i>&hellip;  and other posters scattered about the city demanding voting rights for the illegal aliens, of which it seems there are many.  The high Swiss standard of living and income are a magnet for them.   (Oops   &mdash;   I meant &#8220;undocumented workers&#8221; doing jobs the lazy Swiss don&rsquo;t want to do.)   </p>
<p>Yes, they are going through EXACTLY THE SAME THINGS as we are here in the USA. And all white countries.</p>
<p>THIS IS NO ACCIDENT!!!   Sorry for the caps, but I cannot scream it  any louder.<br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the reverse. The Swiss&rsquo; high standard of living (and high incomes) ATTRACT the hordes of immigrants like bees to honey.</p>
<p>In some cases (Geneva, Basle, Lugano   &mdash;   cities which are on the border) they can live in France or Italy (cheaper cost of living) but work in Swltzerland (high Swiss salaries). With the European Union and Schengen agreement there are no more border formalities and anyone can just walk right through. At Geneva, there are large colonies of Africans and South Asians (sub-continentals) living just across the border in France. It is nothing more than a 20 minute streetcar ride into Geneva.</p>
<p>For instance, the MOST EXPENSIVE and highest income place in France is Divonne, a tiny town of no importance. Amazing!  Why? Because it is on the Swiss border and everyone there works in Switzerland.</p>
<p><i> &#8220;The town is home to some 7030 people, which now includes people from all over the world, for whom Divonne is a pleasant place to live for a few years while they are posted in the Geneva area with multinational companies or international organizations such as the United Nations.&#8221; </i> [Wiki]</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s room for all kinds of people in this world. And there&rsquo;s room for congeniality and Christian compassion between them as well. BUT these should not be confused with sloppy thinking or confused thinking&hellip; that confuses decadent promiscuous ethics with generosity.  To discriminate&hellip; Against someone&hellip;(bad) is very different than properly employing the faculty of discrimination in regards to preserving ones race and culture. It is so much harder to create a culture of lofty beauty than to latch onto it like some wayfairing opportunist. Why doesn&rsquo;t a man build his own house and be satisfied with it ? Man meaning race here. There can be good will between men of all kinds.., and should be&hellip; but this can and should be done&hellip; as I see it&hellip; wihout the dragging down of the higher cultures along with the peculiar genes behind them. We can be friends&hellip; without losing our identity.</p>

<p>Not quite entirely so.  The relationship is intricate and complicated, but many accommodations to the EU have been made, including a series of bilateral treaties. Switzerland is already a member of EFTA, of course.<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joining the EU remains the cabinet&rsquo;s stated option. A Swiss application for membership has been lodged in Brussels but remains dormant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Union is perceived [by the Swiss] as falling short in democratic institutions. There is also concern about the cost: Switzerland would be a net contributor to EU coffers.  And there are doubts whether neutrality would be compatible with EU membership.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But to ensure that Switzerland does not suffer discrimination as a non-member, Swiss legislation in many fields, including trade, has been brought into line with that of the EU.&#8221;<br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2v68azh" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2v68azh</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Swiss voters have approved closer ties with the European Union, by agreeing to join the EU&rsquo;s Schengen and Dublin agreements. The decision means Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, will open its borders, and become part of Europe&rsquo;s passport free zone. </p>
<p>&#8220;Swiss authorities will also share information with their EU colleagues on crime and asylum applications.  The &#8220;Yes&#8221; vote is a relief for the Swiss government, which wants closer integration with the EU. </p>
<p>&#8220;However, Brussels will not allow Switzerland to cherry-pick what it considers  the advantages of the EU.  Trade agreements are dependant on Switzerland signing up to other things&hellip;  The next test for Switzerland&rsquo;s tricky relationship with Brussels will be when the Swiss vote on extending the agreement on the free movement of labour to the EU&rsquo;s 10 new member states.&#8221;<br>

Good stuff Libertarian Realist. </p>
<p>I am a native born white american, born 1964; I lived in Paris for almost 20 years, until 2004; all I can say is thank God for the internet, as my racial awakening only came in the last four years or so, thanks to Amren, a fast internet connection and a good computer (MacBook). </p>
<p>I am a high-IQ, very highly educated, very well-read, well-travelled individual, and this is frightening: for if it takes someone as informed and bright as myself to live into their forties to become racially aware, what does this imply for the less-educated, indoctrinated masses of other whites in the US, Europe, and elsewhere in the Western World? </p>
<p>I salute you for jumping on this thing and sending out videos that really drive the point home. </p>
<p>I do hope you will do more. </p>
<p>However, I ask you to be careful to not be too extreme, as the goal here is to create a racial awakening among fellow Europeans (from the description of my own bio above, it should be apparent what a challenge that is going to be). </p>
<p>As it is, I think you need to follow the Jared Taylor method: make sure that the intelligence of your argument is greater than the apparent &#8220;racist&#8221; nature of the message. </p>
<p>Keep up the good work bro. </p>
<p>I hope you will accept my critical criticism in a positive way. </p>
<p>You have a future in the racialist awareness struggle my friend. </p>
<p>All my very best, </p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t really agree&hellip; Euro-Americans tend to look most like the British, Irish, Germans, and Scandinavians. Oh wait&hellip; that&rsquo;s what Euro-Americans are mainly descended from. The Dutch also often look like Americans. But yes, the French, Iberians, Italians, and Slavs don&rsquo;t really look much like us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what part of the country you are living in&hellip; California perhaps? In California, Euro-Americans are rapidly disappearing, so that observation would be understandable.</p>

<p>American whites used to be healthy and attractive people when they bred within their ethnic group. Everytime I see natural blond hair, red hair and light eyes I am struck by the beauty of those genes.  On the other hand, today&rsquo;s American blacks are better looking than their primitive slave ancestors.  White genes and staying out of the sun have improved their looks.</p>

<p>&#8220;But one thing I can say about Switzerland is that they &lsquo;call a spade a spade&rdquo; and they are not trying to be politically correct. When they want to get rid of a group of people they deport them. Then the UN starts their rant, but the Swiss do what they have to do. You know how hard it is to get citizenship in Switzerland? Most of those in this film probably if not visiting are waiting to hear about their asylum or have limited permits.&#8221;</p>
<p> - - You&rsquo;re deluded my friend.  The Swiss are suffering from the same guilt-complex that has been fostered upon every other White nation - more so in the case of the Swiss because they view themselves AND they are the quintessential Whites.  The person who filmed this did not show a wide area.  If there were this many non-Whites in such a small area it is most likely indicative of a much more widespread phenomenon.  Besides, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken Switzerland is now only about 80% White.  Wasn&rsquo;t it close to 100% only a few years ago?  And the crime, well, most of the rapes of White women in Switzerland ARE by the usual suspects, and the rest of the crime as well.</p>

		<p>I personally have been to Zurich and Tokyo many times (among other international cities).  I can attest to the statements of fact in this video.  Zurich was, at the time of my most recent visit (1995) truly idyllic.  And I even remember a homeless woman asking me for change.  She was well-dressed, spoke three languages, and polite.  She was a native Swiss, at least by appearance and by deportment.  The thing that stuck out about both of those cities is not any kind of heavy-handed police protection.  No, it was the lack of crime and entitlement and TNB.  The photos here indicate that Lucerne, at least, will look like - and act like - Detroit soon.  So sad.</p>

 &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Indeed they are.   NY,NY  says he lived in Switzerland for 15 years. With no disrespect to him, I have to wonder how recently was that?</p>
<p>Switzerland is now a participating member of the Schengen Treaty group, which allows unimpeded access across borders without any formalities whatsoever. It is a borderless zone covering 25 countries, just like the USA.   As I said earlier above, you can just walk across the border - no questions asked. Once someone  has managed to get into of the countries, such as France, he can very easily enter any other&hellip; just as easily as you could travel from Ohio to Indiana.</p>
<p>On checking, I see that Switzerland joined the Schengen Treaty in 2008. I&rsquo;m surprised it was that late.  However, I know personally that the lack of border controls goes back WELL BEFORE that.  I see that the rules are very complex; but essentially a non-EU citizen can stay for 3 months without a visa. I don&rsquo;t know what the requirements are for job seekers but, just as here, I&rsquo;m sure there are a great many illegal aliens unlawfully employed.  In a place like Geneva, you can see that obvious fact just by looking around you. There are foreign faces everywhere - and I mean &#8220;foreign&#8221; to Europe. And no, most of them are not tourists. People who live in an apartment complex with a large family are not tourists.</p>
<p>[Incidentally, as a matter of interest,  Schengen is a small village in Luxembourg where the Agreement was signed   &mdash;   aboard a ship in the Moselle River at the border of 3 countries.]<br>

		<p>Just returned from a trip to Italy and went up to Zurich.  The place is crawling with non whites.  It&rsquo;s a mess. </p>
<p>Italy seems to be the only country that withstood the massive wave of non whites.  True, there are parts with high immigrant populations but not to the extent that the entire European character of the community is transformed as it has been in Zurich.  In Zurich, you do not the get the feeling you are in a white country.  Even in Rome, which is Italy multi-culti capital, you still feel like you are in Europe.  In other words, it still feels somewhat like home.  Not Zurich though.  It&rsquo;s a shame, because the drive from Milan to Zurich is beautiful, a beautiful country and countryside, but then you hit the cities and KABOOM   &mdash;   non white meccas.</p>

		<p>PatRiot #10 (love the name btw), you are so right. We &#8216;aware&rsquo; whites have long known that bits and pieces of our country are, or soon will be uninhabitable by law-abiding Americans, such as DC, Detroit, LA, Miami, etc. Having known that, I was still dumbfounded - and, even more, angered beyond imagination - at what I witnessed last month. We had been saving for years for a cruise (one of the things on my &#8216;hopefully do before I die&rsquo; list), and stayed in Miami the night before sailing. Huge mistake - and now knowing the terrain, will never do it again. At Bayside Market there was almost no English spoken whatsoever. It was swimming in people, huge crowds, but there were almost no whites, and Cuban music was blasting everywhere. All signs, including those for stores and kiosks were were all in Spanish, and Che Guevara / Cuba / Mexico / Argentina, etc. posters &amp; t-shirts, and other touristy junk covered the place. (They have no clue just who Che Guevara really was.) Those few people required to speak English did it with a heavy Cuban accent. I indeed felt like a prisoner in [what used to be] my own land; unnerved, uncomfortable, bitter, and trapped.</p>
<p>Further, actually ON the ship white Americans were literally no more than 40-50% of the passengers. Now, a cruise is a relatively expensive endeavor, and this not a cheap cruise. A ship that is round-trip; LEAVES FROM and RETURNS TO America. What the hell???</p>

		<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I am a very race conscious Swiss, but I feel obliged to comment about the video. While it is true that there are many immigrants living in Switzerland, the film above is terribly biased. Let me get a few facts straight:</p>
<p>1) Most of the immigrants living in Switzerland come from Europe and are therefore white. Right now, Germany is the main &#8220;provider&#8221; of immigrants. But it is true that the number of colored people is increasing.</p>
<p>2) The town of Lucerne, shown in the movie, is a main tourist attraction; it is therefore quite &#8220;normal&#8221; that you see many &#8220;exotic&#8221; people there. When you travel to Lucerne and see large groups of Indians or Japanese, you can be sure that they are tourists that will soon leave the country again. I find it quite sad that the maker of the video distorts the facts in such a way. Our cause doesn&rsquo;t need that&hellip;</p>
<p>3) While it is true that there are problems with african immigrants (for instance drug dealing), violence is often caused by young immigrants from the Balkans, which - to my knowledge - belong to Europe&hellip; </p>
<p>4) In comparison to countries like France or the United Kingdom, the situation is rather relaxed in Switzerland: there are no race riots in sight. But we should nevertheless do everything that is in our power to prevent such things from happening.</p>
<p>Please, dear maker of the movie, be more objective next time.</p>

<p>If you were there in the &rsquo;80s, you saw the original.  A good part of that ancient wooden bridge (the oldest in Europe) was destroyed in 1993  by a fire allegedly caused by a  discarded cigarette. So, some of what you see here is a reconstruction.</p>
<p>Lucerne (Luzern in Ger.) is also a city that retains its ancient medieval walls. Though it is an idyllic and peaceful tourist spot today, it - like  all  Switzerland -  has had a turbulent and violent history.  There were many battles here.  That tower on the bridge was once a dungeon and torture chamber.   The Swiss did not achieve their  present state of  independence and democracy and religious freedom  without a great deal of bloodshed  over the centuries. There was even a civil war between Catholics and Protestants in 1847! Are they now going to  throw all of this tranquility away and return to more division and turmoil  in the misguided pursuit of Diversity?</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a good article about Luzern.<br>

<p>Yes,  a lot of heavy  international pressure has been placed on Switzerland to loosen its restrictions and accept more asylum seekers and immigrants. Little by little, the quotas have been raised and the rules relaxed.  And there will be more if/when it joins the EU.  Brussels will demand it.   What was formerly very difficult is now much easier. What you saw in back the mid-80&rsquo;s  (a quarter century ago!) was a different world from 2010.  But that is true for all of Europe.   And for the USA  and Canada.</p>
<p><b>Hence I assume there is strong undercurrent of resentment from native Swiss.</b></p>
<p>Probably this resentment  is more from rural Swiss than  urban. (There is a big gulf  between the two.)   Also, the French-speaking Swiss   read French magazines and newspapers and (especially in Geneva) tend to go along with standard  French views, which tend to be leftist.   The German areas tend to be more conservative.  </p>
<p>Religiously, though - and this is interesting - the French Swiss are Protestants while the German Swiss are usually  Catholic&hellip;.a reversal of the usual situation&hellip; (but this is  just a generalization).  Luzern, for instance, is  German and Catholic, while French Geneva is known as the Protestant Rome and the home of the Reformation.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say with personal knowledge, but I would guess that the Italian Swiss are affected by whatever ideas are popular in Italy &hellip;since they are so very close to Milan.   Milan is the Big City of their region   &mdash;    and  just a short train ride, hardly more than a commute. </p>
<p><b>its a pity the video maker rather than showing various postcard-like vistas and people also didn&rsquo;t get a chance to talk to a wide variety of Swiss including `New Swiss` about demographic issues, language barriers notwithstanding.  </b></p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t any linguistic barriers in Switzerland to worry about, a very international country.   Most of the Swiss, real Swiss, are very multilingual and have no problem at all with English   &mdash;   and  usually several other languages.  It&rsquo;s nothing uncommon to speak half a dozen.  In fact, I think English is a requirement in the schools.  No, language is not &#8220;the problem&#8221;. <br>
 <br>
However, they might have a problem with discussing these &#8220;demographic issues&#8221;.  I don&rsquo;t know what the Swiss law is (probably better than elsewhere), but I&rsquo;ve never met anyone willing to discuss the subject.  As in the rest of Europe, there seems to be a silent ban on discussing these topics.   There are some things that you don&rsquo;t talk about.  People just clam up.  They have no opinions.</p>
<p>Probably, the  free speech situation is still better in Switzerland.  But everywhere, the Left has succeeded in making immigration  into a non-issue that&rsquo;s beyond the pale of discussion.  It&rsquo;s simply accepted, without debate.  It&rsquo;s like a basic religious tenet that cannot be questioned. It&rsquo;s not open to discussion.  Any resistance to it is equated with &#8220;racism&#8221;, nazis, and all that.  It would be like questioning the Koran in a Moslem country   &mdash;    it simply isn&rsquo;t done.  </p>
<p><b>This would have given the video I believe much more insight and depth.</b></p>
<p>I wish he had photographed the nearly ubiquitous scenes of black pushers,  junkies, prostitutes, and winos that you can see gathered  in front of (or nearby) virtually every major European train station. That&rsquo;s where they congregate.  Also in the otherwise beautiful parks.  So far as I have seen, the police do nothing about them, so long as they&rsquo;re quiet and don&rsquo;t make a  public disturbance.  I think the police are afraid of allegations of racism, so they see nothing.</p>
<p>And I wish he had photographed more scenes of black/white couples and of white women with mulatto babies (no hubby anywhere around),  and also the very frequent sight of  Swiss men with Oriental wives (which seems quite the fad).  </p>
<p>But I realize that photographing these things might have been risky.</p>

		<p>Poster 35 - Willy - I agree to an extent that in the touristy places you can expect to see a larger number of foreigners there simply on vacation (obviously). But I have lived extensively in several European cities (larger and smaller, all worth visiting for the average tourist and deriving a good portion of income from tourism despite not being explicit &#8220;tourist cities&#8221; in every instance) and can say through experience that you should not underestimate how many of the  non-whites you see are there on a permanent/semi-permanent basis. Taking public transport always gives one a good insight, in my opinion, as you can see those who are familiar with the place as opposed to those who give off the obvious tourist vibe. And the proportion of those who are obviously there on a permanent basis has alarmed me in each and every place I have lived - it is exactly how it seems, in that at least in my experience there are NO white safe havens left in central-western Europe.</p>

<p>That is not the issue here! You are missing the point. <br>
This article/video is not about &#8220;crime&#8221;. It is about changing demography.</p>
<p>No matter how peaceful the faces shown, they reveal a changing population, a nation that is in flux, a country that is being invaded. And if this change has been so noticeable within a couple of decades, how much more dramatic will it be within a couple of centuries?</p>
<p>We have had other Swiss posters, in the past, who have written in saying (basically): &#8220;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t really that bad in my little corner of the country. We don&rsquo;t have many immigrants there, in my little town.&#8221;   They fail to see the larger picture!  They are like the proverbial frog in the pot, saying: &#8220;Oh, it&rsquo;s not that hot in here; the temperature has only gone up one degree in the last couple of minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not taking the long-term view of what will it be in another hour, or a century.</p>

		<p>White people in every western country must first begin by having more and more children, so our governments can&rsquo;t say that they are letting coloured foreigners in, because our businesses have a hard time finding new workers.</p>
<p>Later, we can form nationalist parties, elect them to power, and deport all colour people out of our western democracies.</p>

		<p>While it is true, as NY, NY says, that anyone could come to the USA and film junkies and winos in the street,  maybe even a mugging in progress,  that was not the point of this video. </p>
<p>It  was not supposed to be a general travelogue showing an overall picture of Switzerland. Its purpose was to show DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE, specifically, and that&rsquo;s why the maker focused on these things.  It was also not about &#8220;crime&#8221;,  &#8220;rape&#8221;,  &#8220;trouble-makers&#8221;, etc.  In  fact, those things were not even mentioned. They weren&rsquo;t the point. </p>
<p>I find it interesting, and revealing of the difference in the two mentalities, that Americans see &#8220;race&#8221; (as a thing in itself)  while the Swiss  (and Europeans)  do not.  Instead, the Swiss say that &#8220;crime&#8221; isn&rsquo;t really so bad. Or that when groups are &#8220;causing trouble&#8221;, they are deported. Otherwise, the Swiss don&rsquo;t see any real issue here. What&rsquo;s the fuss  all about?  </p>
<p>But, from an American viewpoint, this video  wasn&rsquo;t about &#8220;crime&#8221; or &#8220;rape&#8221; or groups  who are &#8220;making trouble. It was about the <i>racial transformation</i>  of the population. Europeans, having little historical experience with racial issues, just don&rsquo;t see it that way. They don&rsquo;t notice another race unless (or until) it&rsquo;s &#8220;making trouble&#8221;.  But that&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s too late&hellip;. As the French are starting to learn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also add that Lucerne is a major tourist center, just as Willy said, but not an attraction otherwise. So you do see many foreign tourist groups there. (Asian tourists especially, tend to travel in large groups and cluster together.)  But when you see them working in shops, riding public transit, and going to school, those are not tourists.  And  Lucerne is just a small city. The big business  cities are more filled with immigrants   &mdash;  - Geneva more so than any.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia, 54.4% of people living in Geneve hold a foreign passport.  (And those would be only the legal and officially registered ones.) I am sure without any doubt that if the French suburbs of the city were included, the percentage of foreigners would be far higher. Even so, many of those suburbanites considered as &#8220;French&#8221; (according to their papers)  are actually African.  Geneve is not really typical of the rest of the country, yet, but it is the direction in which it is heading &hellip; an admonitory  glimpse of the future.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t the internet a marvel? More and more White people are waking up. Our ideas are mainstreaming in Western civilization little by little. This will end in our favor one way or another, sooner or later, and perhaps, out of these ashes, our civilization will learn a valuable lesson that will be remembered forever more.</p>
