<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Minnesota town is outraged over reports that an illegal immigrant was implanted with a penis pump  &mdash;  paid for by taxpayers.</p>
<p>Shakopee Police Chief Jeff Tate said the expense to taxpayers was more than $50,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ciliberto [Scott County Attorney Pat Ciliberto] told county commissioners the cost of taking care of illegal immigrants in their community is skyrocketing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It should be obvious when Scott County goes from seven bookings in 2006 to 90 bookings in 2009  &mdash;  that Arizona&rsquo;s problem is Minnesota&rsquo;s problem, too,&#8221; he told the newspaper.</p>
<p>According to published numbers, the county spent more than $800,000 housing inmates with immigration holds  &mdash;  and that doesn&rsquo;t include medical coverage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Regardless, local officials said they are required by federal and state laws to provide welfare to illegals  &mdash;  from court costs to health care  &mdash;  including a penis pump.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;My hats off to Arizona, to people who&rsquo;ve said, &#8216;We&rsquo;ve had enough,&rsquo;&#8221; Commissioner Barbara Marschall told the newspaper. &#8220;We&rsquo;re thousands (of) miles away from the southern border. It&rsquo;s here and it&rsquo;s going to get worse.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The answer for enforcement against illegals is simple. Illegal entry into the United States should be punishable by a fine in excess of 25K to 50K per person. The illegal would be returned to their home country with this fine on their heads. They should be banned from America for life, denied re-entry for any reason. If found in America a second time, all property and assets would be confiscated to pay the outstanding fines. The subject, should they have the 50K to pay the fines, would then have a second fine assessed and be returned, under ban again to their home country. No need to chase employers, no need to secure jobs, it becomes economically imprudent to work illegally in the U.S..</p>

		<p>Keynesians refer to this kind of spending by government as &#8220;priming the pump.&#8221;  Teapartiers, however, denounce it as &#8220;inflationary.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p>Who would be so insecure to need a penis pump, which probably doesn&rsquo;t even work anyway?</p>
<p>Not only is this story stupid; it&rsquo;s insane because the tax-payers are paying for an illegal alien to possibly resolve his sexual issues, which exist only in his head.</p>

		<p>What? Is there <i>no</i> one who will stand up and scream &#8220;Racism&#8221; at the Racist suggestion that nonWhites could ever need penis pumps?  Such Bigotry and Hate must not go unchallenged!</p>
<p>Wait&rsquo;ll the NAACP and LaRaza hear about this outrage!<br>

<p>And how long until we hear that this worthless &ldquo;immigrant&rdquo; used his mandated penis pump, to rape a woman or a child?</p>
<p>Probably within the next year, if not the next 24 hours!</p>

		<p>Can someone find out if these pumps were paid for with monies from the recent stimulus package?  If ObamaCare funds it, then there really is a pubic option.</p>
