			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Juan Dejesus, NBC New York, July 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police are investigating another assault on a Hispanic man in Staten Island as a possible hate crime  &mdash;  and the Mexican government is now getting involved as well.</p>
<p>Five men attacked the 40-year-old Mexican man Friday night as he was walking home after a soccer game at Faber Park, cop said. The attackers allegedly pummeled him while yelling anti-Mexican epithets. The man suffered head trauma, a fractured jaw and needed ten stitches above his eye, officials said.</p>
<p>The group of men made off with his backpack.</p>
<p>This is at least the sixth violent, ethnically-charged incident that has taken place in the neighborhood since April, and community leaders are urging residents to remain alert.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will act decisively in order to protect our citizens and will actively promote that those guilty of these vicious attacks are brought to justice expeditiously. We are working hand-in-hand with local authorities on all levels,&#8221; said Consul General of Mexico in New York, Ruben Beltran in an email to the Staten Island Advance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the Advance, this latest incident has promoted the Mexican Consulate to post personnel in Staten Island until further notice. This move is an effort to safeguard the rights of individuals and effectively assist and provide information to the Mexican residents of this area.</p>
<p>The Guardian Angels, lead by Curtis Sliwa, have also pledged to patrol the area.  Make the Road New York, a local community group that serves the communities of Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island is organizing a march that will take place on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mexican officials have also created an information line that for immigrants to contact if they are afraid to contact authorities directly, the number is 1-800-724-7264.</p>

		<p>Wait until they find out the suspects are black or black-ish.  Then all the talk about human rights or hate crimes will stop.  Or, if not ended, then slanted in an intellectually dishonest and deceitful fashion.</p>

		<p>Yup.  They most likely ARE black assailants.  I guess they don&rsquo;t like being dispossessed and threatened.  But of course the blacks cannot imagine that WE might be angry about OUR dispossession and replacement by BLACKS AND Illegals and hispanics.<br>
Folks, the pot is boiling hard, and the lid is about to be blown off.  Everywhere.</p>

		<p>Gee, I wonder what race the attackers are?? This article left out that minor detail. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet that MANY would walk away after reading this article, thinking that those racists Whites are at it again. And I&rsquo;m willing to bet that that is exactly what the writer of this article wants readers to think. </p>

		<p>I live in NYC and work with several people who live in Staten Island as well as growing up there myself.  Everyone knows it is blacks who committed these crimes.  I overheard it being discussed by co-workers who know the score the with the media hiding black criminals and slanting stories to make it look like whitey did it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Consul General of Mexico in New York: &ldquo;We will act decisively to protect our citizens.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Yes, unless of course they&rsquo;re in Mexico where 20,000 cartel murders have taken place since 2006.  In that case we can&rsquo;t protect anybody, especially since the cartels are ambushing our military patrols and police and causing those they threatened with death to leave the country or be killed for opposing drug dealing.</p>
<p>Remember the Mexican slogan:  &#8220;If the drug lords don&rsquo;t get you, the federales will.  Have you paid your fee yet to the local corrupt official so you can scrounge through the dump?&#8221;</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget to fly the Mex flag high from your office or house right after you are told there are no jobs or food for you, so you&rsquo;ll have to sneak into Gringoland.  </p>
<p>Such a guarded and proud people who protect their own.  (Maybe, sometimes, well, nowhere but Gringoland.)</p>
<p>Maybe the patrols can call themselves the Yellow Berets, each one wearing one when he goes out on patrol.</p>

		<p>When there was an attack on a Hispanic in Long Island about a year ago by a group of white teenagers, there were almost daily news reports about the heinous nature of the crime and how white racism had to end. Eventually the one who stabbed and killed the Ecuadorean got 25 years in jail due to the Hate added penalty.</p>
<p>In reading the Spanish language newspaper today it clearly points out that this was an attack by blacks and that is not uncommon. There was talk about &#8220;killing the Mexican&#8221;, even though the individual was from El Salvador. It also pointed out that the Guardian Angels will start patrolling certain neighborhoods in Staten Island after this.</p>
<p>I usually read the newspaper, &#8220;El Diario,&#8221; in New York and I can tell you that there is more and more news about the dangers of blacks attacking Hispanics around the New York area. The problem between blacks and Hispanics hasn&rsquo;t reached the point it has in the Los Angeles area, but it seems to be getting there as more and more Hispanics, especially Mexicans, take advantage of New York and other nearby cities being sanctuary cities and move to these parts.</p>

<p>How long is it going to take for White people to wake up?</p>
<p>How about some &#8220;White&#8221; officials patrolling EVERY city to protect Whites against the onslaught of Color?  We&rsquo;re being literally systematically destroyed as a race and all Whites do is run.  When are we going to turn and fight?</p>

		<p>Almost every attack of this sort is by black criminals who probably just believe that such marks carry their cash on them and that they won&rsquo;t complain to the cops.  Of course the media, by not identifying the attackers&rsquo; race, can make it sound like hate crimes committed by whites.</p>

		<p>Obviously, the attackers were black, else the story would have identified them as white.  It&rsquo;s interesting how in MSM news stories white offenders are always identified by race, black criminals never.  This often carried to comical extremes, with black suspects always described in great detail, &#8220;5&rsquo;8&#8221;, stocky, 20-25 years old, wearing black pants and an orange T-shirt, with tatoos on both arms, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, I suppose the MSM could (but obviously wouldn&rsquo;t) make the reasonable explanation that whites rarely are involved in street crime, so their race is noted only in such exceptional cases.</p>

		<p>I watch spanish language television news to &#8216;know the enemy&#8221; so to speak and have found quite a difference in how they report attacks. When reporting any attacks on hispanics the spanish language media doesn&rsquo;t make a special effort to hide the race of the perpetrators. I have seen at least half a dozen survellience videos that clearly show black attackers.</p>

		<p>I work in a 100% latino school.  It used to be housed in a building with an all black school on another floor.  The blacks used to beat the latino kids every day after school.  (I&rsquo;m talking big gangbanger beat downs, harrasment, the works.)  </p>
<p>It got so bad that special security was put on hand to help the latino students get away.  There is no black and brown unity beyond temporary alliances to take from whitey.  Otherwise, on the ground, it&rsquo;s open warfare!  Look at how Compton (CA) became majority latino in less than ten years!</p>

<p>There was a News story that was on one of the Cable Stations,about three years ago, of a White man that was murdered in his driveway, on Christmas Eve, by Hispanics, a few blocks from the Commuter Train Station that he walked to every day, to travel into New York City. </p>
<p>Of course, the murderers were MS13 slugs, and more than likely Illegal, but the thing that I noticed most, is how there was no outpouring of rage and disgust over this heinous act, on Christmas Eve, to a Homeowner that just got home, to spend the Holidays with his family. </p>
<p>Where were the protest marches? Where was the anger? Where were the charges of &#8220;Hate Crimes&#8221;? Where was the demand for swift and certain Justice?  </p>
<p>And now, that News is as dead as the victim, who was buried by his family. </p>
