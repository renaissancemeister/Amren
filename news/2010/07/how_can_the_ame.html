<h1><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/22/AR2010072206713.html">How Can the American Latino Museum Best Answer the Call of the Mall?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Philip Kennicott, Washington Post, July 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since the Indian museum [the Smithsonian&rsquo;s National Museum of the American Indian,] opened in September 2004, the number of visitors has eroded. In 2005, 2.2 million passed through its doors, but it will be touch and go, this year, to maintain last year&rsquo;s count of 1.4 million.</p>
<p>With a 23-member commission reporting to Congress in September on the feasibility of a major new museum on the Mall  &mdash;  the National Museum of the American Latino  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s worth taking a hard look at the problems of the Indian museum. The last thing the Mall needs is a huge new architectural bulk with minimal cultural impact.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More important than how the museum is governed is how it is conceived and executed. The big danger is that the National Museum of the American Latino will arrive just as the heyday of ethnic museums is passing.</p>
<p>The primary problem with the Indian museum is that it was organized with Native American communities rather than general visitors as its primary client. Exhibition space was turned over to tribal groups to tell their own stories. The result was fractured and often chaotic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Indeed, the entire concept of a Latino American Museum seems almost retro. Sometime between 2040 and 2050, according to a study done by the Center for the Future of Museums, today&rsquo;s minority groups will make up a majority of the American population. Americans will be &#8220;hybridized,&#8221; with multiple ethnic strands to their identity.</p>
<p>Or, as Gregory Rodriguez of the New America Foundation put it at a lecture at the Canadian Embassy in February, &#8220;We have no idea what it means to be Latino in 2050. None.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} There&rsquo;s resistance to them [ethnically focused museums] among people who don&rsquo;t identify as minorities, and while much of that resistance is based in racial and ethnic animus, some of it represents legitimate concern that history won&rsquo;t be well served by an infinite fracturing into sub-narratives, each under the control of a different cultural group.</p>
<p>It seems likely that within a generation, the Mall could have a large collection of very quiet and not terribly relevant museums. Not because the stories they have to tell are irrelevant or uninteresting, but because the game changed. The appetite for history will be for complicated master narratives that cross lines between ethnic groups, that dip into technology and economics and art, and can&rsquo;t easily be told in an old-fashioned, balkanized museum of ethnic identity.<br>

		<p>&ldquo;It seems likely that within a generation, the Mall could have a large collection of very quiet and not terribly relevant museums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How ironic, if one is familiar with the concept of the &ldquo;dying mall&rdquo; or &ldquo;dead mall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are shopping malls that are: older, smaller, economically unviable, and often in &ldquo;transformed&rdquo; multicultural areas. The process of dying and ultimately death for such malls, is the vibrant influx of colorful shops and shoplifters, that do little to &ldquo;enrich&rdquo; the mall in question and eventually manage to jettison it into socioeconomic oblivion.  </p>
<p>Funny, but it does sound kind of like a familiar narrative, and subsequent metaphor, for multiculturalism in general.</p>
<p>Would you not agree,</p>
<p>John PM?</p>

<p>One can only imagine what chaos individual Hispanic subgroups would produce. Puerto Rican fighting Dominicans over who should get a larger exhibit. Which Hispanic-American should be seen as the ultimate Hispanic-American representative. Mexicans would of course dominate and be bitterly resented. </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait until it&rsquo;s completed. </p>

		<p>I have no problem with a museum devoted to Indians, blacks, hispanics, etc. as long as it&rsquo;s built with private funds.</p>
<p>Of course we instead get museums devoted to the worship of nonwhites paid for by white taxpayers with zero nonwhite customers bothering to show up.</p>

		<p>The problem with most museums of this type is that they exist to glorify the subjects not to tell the real truth.  After all mini-museums in South Africa fail to advise that before the Europeans arrived, the indigenous were living as they had for over 2 000 years, no wheels, no writing possible except for cave paintings, and so on.   All the SA museums tend to do is to glorify the current government for their terrorist battles. </p>

		<p>About that Indian Smithsonian museum and decreasing visitors number - isn&rsquo;t it so, that visiting a museum or a gallery is practically the White and to some extent also East Asian thing? Aren&rsquo;t these groups no more inclined in seeing the revamped museum? <br>
Any thoughts or experience?</p>

		<p>I have no problem with Indian museums (although I&rsquo;m not sure they should be in charge of the exhibits). Indians have by and large disappeared so it&rsquo;s interesting to learn about them. Latinos, on the other hand, are everywhere. Therefore, a museum is not necessary. </p>

		<p>Museums can only be useful and viable if they contain artifacts, art, and technological progression of historical consequence.</p>
<p>Cultures with few or none of these advances to their credit simply do not warrant museums, though perhaps they could have a display or two in a real museum.</p>
<p>This silliness of trying to invent rich histories of largely inconsequential tribes and racial groups is just one more way of disparaging genuinely important history, or perhaps more to the point, turning reality and falsehood on their respective heads.</p>

<p>The more the Frankfurters and the Boas Constrictors clutter up DC with all these Affirmative Action uplift exercises devoted to showcasing one unimportant (yet somehow extremely <i>fashionable</i>) minority group after another, the less Normal White Americans [TM] like me will feel &#8220;The Call of the Mall.&#8221; </p>
<p>If I want to be lectured to about how even the most backwards, violent, and even <i>cannibalistic</i> of primitive tribes were all morally and scientifically superior to Evil White Europeans, why should I drive all the way to Washington when I can just switch on PBS? </p>

		<p>Going along with what poster 7 said, other than the incas, aztecs and mayas, what exactley would be in a latino museum?</p>
<p>Latinos haven&rsquo;t invented anything, explored anything, wrote much of consequence or built anything remarkable.  Beyond a few personalities more appropriate to a museum in their home countries, there hasn&rsquo;t even been many famous latinos outside of music.  </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to celebrate simon bolivar here or even cesar chavez the grape boycotter.  </p>
<p>Just what would you put inside that would so warrant a 200 million dollar building, cost and endowment?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just pics of happy latinos, we could save a lot of money by just publishing a photo book.</p>
<p>I am still scratching my head about the contents of the museum.  Perhaps replicas of a grinding mill still used all throughout latin america, or a sombrero, a pinata, who knows?</p>

		<p>I somewhat disagree with the last poster about the poor showing of latinos in important cultural matters. I am an amateur in the realms of cosmology and philosophical issues related to it, but in the literature the name of Guillermo Gonzalez (American, Univ. of Iowa) is frequently heard ( take a look at his latest &#8220;The Privileged Planet&#8221; ) and in cosmology proper Dr. Frausto Da Silva (European, Portuguese) is widely admired.<br>
However, in the main, the tragedy of latin underdevelopment is well understood. The abysmal history of Argentina in the 20th century is a cautionary tale our native &#8220;socialistas&#8221; should ponder.</p>

<p>You have stumbled upon their true intent. Whites will stay out of D.C, the seat of power.</p>

		<p>Interesting, Michael  &mdash;  last I checked, I still existed. Enrolled Eastern Band Cherokee, half to be exact. And we also go to museums  &mdash;  we&rsquo;re not idiots. </p>
