<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} [The] administration immediately sent military assistance and millions of dollars in emergency aid [to Haiti]. But it has yet to take another crucial step: expediting the immigration to the United States of the 55,000 Haitians who already have been approved for visas by the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>These Haitians, sponsored by relatives who are either legal residents or citizens, have met all requirements; among other things, they have provided the government with legally binding affidavits from family members guaranteeing financial support so that they do not become a public burden. Due to a monumental backlog of visas available for Haitians, however, officials say the process takes from four to 11 years. {snip}</p>
<p>Removing tens of thousands of people from Haiti&rsquo;s ruins and allowing them to live and work in the United States would automatically turn them into providers and benefactors, speeding the island nation&rsquo;s recovery. Even before the 7.0 earthquake, remittances were crucial to its survival, but now they are indispensable. Millions of Haitians living abroad, including about 800,000 in the U.S., sent home nearly $2 billion last year, and World Bank economists expect to see a 20% surge this year. {snip}</p>
<p>Legislation to create a family reunification program for Haitians, modeled on the Cuban program, is pending in Congress. But it is unnecessary. Obama only has to give the order and the Department of Homeland Security will move Haitians to the front of the line. {snip}</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve met some Caribbean blacks who remit to their relatives.</p>
<p>They are the cheapest spenders and a net loss for the economy. </p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t tip, they take advantage of charities, they are often on assistance, they contribute little in taxes, and they let their neighborhoods fall apart because they keep no money for investment in their home.</p>
<p>What they do is not unlike barbarians looting a country.</p>

		<p>That makes perfect sense, seeing as OUR economy is doing so well and we have jobs just going to rot because we don&rsquo;t have enough people to take them. I mean, when was the last time you heard anything about AIDS in our country? We have doctors with way too much time on their hands, this will help them keep busy. Maybe, they can share the diverse symptoms of their condition with us! </p>
<p>How do you type with sarcasm again?</p>

		<p>Why not bring them here. Whites will say or do nothing to stop this insanity, we have been forced to live in for the last 4 or so decades now. </p>
<p>Does anyone here think the majority of Whites will wake up to the racial scam that has been forced on them since 1965? I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Take the Tea Party for example. They vehemently deny they are &#8220;racists&#8221; and they proclaimed loud and clear that they did not want White &#8220;racists&#8221; in their little party. Enough of the tea party. They are hopeless.</p>

		<p>Is the LA times aware that the US is in a deep recession w/massive unemployment and that California is broke?</p>

		<p>Pure insanity.  There is a belief system which states placing non-white people closer to white people will change non-white people&rsquo;s behavior.  The reality proves that wrong.  Haitians will bring the mayhem they created in Haiti with them.</p>

<p>What a joke! Once these lowlifes are in the US an affidavit of support does NOT stop them from recieving benefits! They are a BURDEN to the US.</p>

		<p>Future Nordic whites will have to deal with the mess created by present whites.  Hopefully, there are enough of them left on this planet to keep it going forward.  It is nice to play Santa Claus using someone&rsquo;s money.  You would think that there are enough blacks here since the colonial times to keep everyone busy for a very, very long time.  No, the envelope has to be continual stuffed until it bursts beyond repair.  Where is common sense?  This constant trying to out do each other in trying to look good at the expense of destroying this country has to stop.  The average man will have to strongly step forward to save this country.  The corruption at every level will have to be pulled out by its roots. </p>

		<p>Most of us here on Amren know what the problem is. Let&rsquo;s cut to the bone. The problem is allowing ANY nonwhite into our land in the first place. Once here the traitors/enemy will bring in millions more of them until we are the minority in our own lands. We even PAY (taxes) for them to overtake us.</p>
<p> Now, how truly insane is it for us NOT to know what is going on and stopping the insanity?</p>

		<p>Anyone with a sense of history knows Haitians are known for their racism.<br>
If whites only existed in Haiti whites would no longer exist.<br>
Importing Haitians to America will only lead to a consolitation of hate nd ambiguity against the white population, violence, and race mixing.</p>

		<p>Encouraging blacks to immigrate to the United States is insane.  Everywhere those people live, and everywhere they move, they have high crime rates, and perform poorly in the classroom and on the job.  <br>
 <br>
This is too much of a coincidence to keep blaming it on &#8220;white racism.&#8221;  It is not our fault blacks are so bad.  It is the fault of bad genes.   <br>
 <br>
Ever since emancipation whites in the United States have been collectively punished for tolerating the slave trade.  We would be far better off if those people had never been brought over here.  The best we can do is to keep the rest out.  </p>

		<p>Every Haitian I know is a ghetto thug.  Even if they have a decent job and (wonder of wonders) a college degree, they act so coarse and rough and emulate every negative personal mannerism of the gangsta rappers.</p>
<p>Where are the Cubans in Florida?  I thought they hated Haitians!   They need to stand up before Hispanic Florida becomes little Haiti!</p>
