<h1>Afghan Army Struggles With Ethnic Divisions</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Heidi Vogt, Google News, July 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But in southern Afghanistan, the focus of the U.S. war effort, nearly all the Afghan soldiers are foreigners too. Most don&rsquo;t even speak the local language. They have to communicate through interpreters hired for the Americans.</p>
<p>Despite ethnic quotas and recruiting drives, the Afghan army is still dominated by northern minorities who were oppressed by the Taliban. Nearly all Taliban are ethnic Pashtuns. Although many Pashtuns, the country&rsquo;s biggest ethnic community, are not connected to the Taliban, the rift between northerners and the southern Pashtuns runs deep.</p>
<p>Now this ethnically skewed army is pouring into southern Afghanistan as part of an operation to squeeze the Taliban out of strongholds here and win the loyalty of the main prize  &mdash;  the Afghan people.</p>
<p>When the international forces leave  &mdash;  whether it is next year or a decade from now  &mdash;  this mixed bag of soldiers will either rise to the challenge or allow the country to fall back into a collection of loosely affiliated territories ruled by tribally based militias.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can be here in the Pashtun area for 1,000 years, but they will never be our friends,&#8221; said Lt. Gulagha Haksar, a 30-year-old Afghan soldier teamed up with U.S. troops here in the strategic Arghandab Valley. An ethnic Tajik, Gulagha remembers the killing sprees by the Taliban in his hometown in northeastern Takhar province.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Afghanistan has never been a strongly unified nation, but ethnic divisions intensified during the Soviet Union occupation of the 1980s, when resistance factions organized along ethnic lines. When these fighters unseated a Soviet-backed leader in 1992, they became embroiled in a civil war.</p>
<p>The Pashtun-dominated Taliban seized Kabul in 1996 and ruled from the capital until they were ousted five years later by the U.S.-led coalition and its Afghan allies in the Northern Alliance resistance group, made mostly of ethnic Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras.</p>
<p>To give the military a national character, the Afghan army now has ethnic quotas for officers: 40-45 percent Pashtun, 30-35 percent Tajik, 10-12 percent Hazara and 8-10 percent Uzbek and other groups, according to Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s roughly in line with the population. But the army does not track the actual ethnic makeup of the officer corps, so it&rsquo;s difficult to know if the quotas are really filled. There are no quotas for enlisted soldiers.</p>
<p>The Afghan army tries to ensure a mix of ethnic groups in each brigade of enlisted soldiers, but it is hard to find a brigade that northerners do not dominate. Of the nearly 40 soldiers based with the Americans at Combat Outpost Ware in the Arghandab Valley, only two are Pashtun. One of them is the cook.</p>

<p>When the Afghans go on patrol in surrounding villages, they are treated as outsiders.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they see us, the old men say, &#8216;They are the sons of the British,&rsquo;&#8221; Gulagha said, explaining that the villagers equate both the Americans and the Afghan soldiers with the British attempt to colonize Afghanistan in the 1800s.</p>
<p>Even in Kandahar city, which is more diverse than the villages, there&rsquo;s a reticence to trust the northerner-dominated army.</p>

<p>The author doesn&rsquo;t seem to get it.  There is a Hazara people, there is a Pashtun people, there is a tajik people,etc.  However, there is no &#8220;Afghan people&#8221; just like there is no &#8220;American people.&#8221;  Just because a bunch of people live in a state together that does not make them the same people.  I think we really need to clarify what is a people, what is a nation, and what is just a state.  I have begun to get really annoyed lately seeing people call things what they aren&rsquo;t.  I saw a documentary a while back on the Hapsburg Empire that referred to it as &#8220;a multiethnic hapsburg nation.&#8221;  I was so sickened that I imediately turned it off.  I think a lot of this is deliberatley done by globalists to destoy the concept of nationhood. We need to counter this by making it known that a persons race, ethnicity, and nationality are all the same thing.  Their passport might call them something different like american or afghan, but that does not change who they are.  By throwing our identity completely in with a state we allow ourselves to be used by politicians to attain their goals, most of which have been show to be detremental to our people.  I&rsquo;ve always felt that most white americans weren&rsquo;t this or that hyphenated american group, but a unique people.  I think one way to express this is to come up with a different name for ourselves than white americans.  Too many people go on about not wanting to be called white and by calling ourselves americans we link ourselves with the acitons of the state which has shown itself to be hostile to us.  Let us hope it does not take an internal war like that occuring in Afghanistan to get most whites to figure our that all americans are not one people.</p>

		<p>This is a perfect illustration of why it&rsquo;s a self-destructive idea for the U.S. government to offer automatic green cards to illegal Mexican aliens who are willing to serve in our armed forces.  I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be under fire in Iraq with my life on the line, knowing that the Mexican next to me doesn&rsquo;t speak a word of English and is only there because he doesn&rsquo;t want to be sent back to Juarez.</p>

I saw it on an ADL bumbper sticker today (so you KNOW it&rsquo;s true). It said DIVERSITY MAKES US STRONGER!<br>
And the letters were multicolored, happy, off-kilter and all festive-like.<br>
C&rsquo;mon, say it! DIVERSIty makes us&hellip;OH FORGET IT.</p>

		<p>Yoo-hoo!  Diversity&rsquo;s not a strength in any army.</p>
<p>Anybody who believes otherwise wasn&rsquo;t in Vietnam during the height of that conflict, when blacks comprised roughly 12% of line company strength but accounted for the overwhelming majority of disciplinary problems, to include willful disobedience, cowardice, fragging incidents, desertion, etc.</p>
<p>Interestingly, now that recruits can pick their MOS prior to induction, blacks steer clear of the combat arms, which are now overwhelmingly white and Hispanic.  Ironically, blacks are now back where they were before the Army was integrated, which is to day support functions such as transportation, supply, food preparation, etc.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Who are willing to serve in our armed Forces&#8221; -Drew   Giving citizenship to people willing to serve in our Armed Forces.<br>
 I used to think it was a good idea till I saw a poster who said they were uncomfortable about our government offering citizenship and giving guns to foreigners who might just be asked to turn them on us!! If our govenment grants them citizenship, then their primary loyalty will be to our government and not  We the people. Another instance where a clear thinking AMRen poster turned me around 180 Degrees with their argument.</p>

Yes they are back in support functions along with the white women, and they STILL cause the vast majority of discipline problems.</p>
<p>But things like that are to be tolerated and swept under the carpet in our &#8220;multi-cultural&#8221; society.</p>

		<p>True Story.</p>
<p>&#8216;Back in the day&rsquo; when Afghanistan was a truly nasty deep, stinking, hole instead of just an ugly one, they needed some gear in the West (where they were building airbases, facing Iran&hellip;) which had to be transported from the Kandahar via road.</p>
<p>So they left with about three trucks and a couple of gun-truck modified Hummers.  Along with an Afghan security contingent.</p>
<p>They go about 2/3rds of the way there when they had to pass through a valley.  Bottom of the valley, all hell breaks loose, convoy cohesion breaks down and half the convoy gets left behind while the other half breaks out of the COMPANY SIZED ambush and charges up the opposite slope.  That&rsquo;s 200 effectives for those not up on these things.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, they discovered they&rsquo;d left the other guys behind, men who were now out of their vehicles, trying to make small behind rocks that couldn&rsquo;t hide an anorexic gopher and laying down quite an impressive base of fire to prevent being overrun.  So back down &#8216;into the valley&rsquo; their buddies went to share without question the fate of their brothers in arms.</p>
<p>I say brothers because, of the Afghans, there was not a soul to be seen.</p>
<p>After about 45 minutes of assorted stuff, almost down to throwing rocks, the QRA A-10 pair shows up (why the insurgents waited so long to attack, I never said they were stupid).</p>
<p>Takes quite a bit of coordination because the ETAC is down and nobody had a working ROVER unit and it was just about the perfect setup for shoulder launched missiles if the local dush had any to shoot from the narrow valley sides.</p>
<p>Finally, they get good bombs and a couple strafes in and just about the time the Hogs had decided the neighboring village also deserved some fire and iron, the local Afghans send over a request that &#8216;all sides be allowed to retreat&rsquo;.  This request carried in by&hellip;you guessed it, and Afghan security detachment member.  Agreement was reached and the rest of the Afghani troops showed up, miraculously unharmed, though of course without weapons or ammo.</p>
<p>Some six hours later, the convoy limped back into Kandahar.  The A-10s never leaving.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: There are no &#8216;patriotic&rsquo; Afghans.  Specifically: never bring along indigs into the deep ugly, with the popularity of cell phones, your opsec is screwed from the outset and you -can&rsquo;t- keep an eye on everybody when the excrement hits the rotary cooling mechanism.</p>
<p>IMO, 373 billion dollar later, we should leave that place.</p>
<p>If the &#8216;5 pillars of Islam&rsquo; (charity anyone?) boys have figured out that the &#8216;Stan is a hole not worth renovating, 9 years later, we should be able to as well.  Turn it into one giant RECONDO school and let the snake eaters have the run of the place, sniping Mulah Omar and UBL from the bushes, just like Op Phoenix in the last UCW we chose to lose.</p>
<p>I mean, THAT was our original goal, was it not?  Get our man and go home?  &#8216;Charlie Wilson&rsquo;s War&rsquo; aside, we owe these people _nothing_ beyond the freedom from the Sovs we already paid for.</p>
<p>Not a damn thing.</p>

		<p>To commenter Number 1 - Amen. I couldn&rsquo;t have said it better than that myself. I hate few things more than when people call something a &#8220;nation,&#8221; a &#8220;people,&#8221; when in reality they are nothing but an assorted bunch of homo sapiens who just so happen to have the same passport covers. They may or may not even speak the same language. Afghanistan is the perfect example of this, but other good examples include the United States, any Western European nation lately, Persia (Iran), Indonesia, and just about every African &#8220;nation&#8221; (most countries in the dark continent don&rsquo;t have any dominant ethnic group. In Nigeria, for example, the largest group are the Hausa, at a mere 21% of the total population!). </p>
