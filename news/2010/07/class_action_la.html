			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Robert Morse, My Two Census, June 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Earlier this year, MyTwoCensus informed readers about a class action lawsuit that alleges that the Census Bureau discriminates in its hiring process against individuals who have been arrested even though they were never charged with a crime. MyTwoCensus.com subsequently received many inquiries from white/Caucasian people who were not hired by the Census Bureau for this reason and hoped to join this lawsuit and were told that because they were white/Caucasian they were unable to partake in the lawsuit. MyTwoCensus.com wrote to the lawyer in charge of the suit, Adam Klein, of the firm Golden Outten in New York to determine if this was true. Unfortunately, Mr. Klein confirmed that only minorities are eligible to participate in this lawsuit. This is a travesty because this lawsuit itself is now discriminatory against any non-minority who wasn&rsquo;t hired by the Census Bureau because of alleged (though unproven) misconduct. MyTwoCensus encourages Golden Outten to open this suit to everyone, because if justice is served, it should be served for all.</p>

		<p>We can expect more of this sort of blatant anti-white discrimination as whites become ever more of a minority.  After all, Bill and Melinda Gates have not been dropped from any socialite&rsquo;s A-list just because their foundation discriminates against whites.  There is still little downside to being openly anti-white.<br>

		<p>We won&rsquo;t join the suit, because, unlike many blacks, we&rsquo;re too busy working.</p>

		<p>Time for White people to wake up and realize the laws against discrimination were NOT designed with them in mind  &mdash;  or rather to discriminate AGAINST them in very way possible.</p>

		<p>If they let white people join the class they couldn&rsquo;t claim &#8220;white racism&#8221; as a cause.  The litigants would not be sufficiently common in interest to certify the class.</p>
<p>So leave the white folks out.  It really is a much bigger problem for black folks due to the huge number of criminals in their community.</p>
<p>Which is, I am sure, going to be one of the big points the plaintiff&rsquo;s attorneys make.</p>
