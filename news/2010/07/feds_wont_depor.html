	<p>Federal immigration officials will not be taking custody of Antonia Rivera of Santa Ana and her fellow illegal immigrants arrested on Capitol Hill Tuesday for demonstrating for a bill that would give her and others brought to the United States as children the chance to live here legally.</p>
<p>&#8220;None of them have been referred to ICE,&#8221; said Gillian Brigham, spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. &#8220;Our focus is on smart immigration enforcement that focuses first on criminal aliens and people who post the greatest threat to the communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rivera, 28, a graduate of UC Irvine, was arrested Tuesday along with 20 others. All were released by the end of the day Wednesday and will have to return to Washington next month for court appearances.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rivera was arrested in the Hart Senate Office Building along with 11 others who sat in a circle in the atrium of the building wearing graduation caps and gowns. Capitol Police asked them to move and when they refused they were arrested. They were charged with disorderly conduct.</p>
<p>Juan Escalante, a spokesman for the arrested students, said they are actually disappointed that they haven&rsquo;t been turned over to federal officials because it would make their actions dramatic.</p>
<p>They came to the nation&rsquo;s capitol to try and persuade lawmakers to move on the DREAM Act. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When someone is taken into ICE custody it cost money and manpower, she said, to detain them, hold immigration court proceedings and deport them.</p>

		<p>My white Canadian friend spent two years trying to migrate to the United States.  </p>
<p>When she overstayed her visitor visa, she was red-flagged by border police and refused entry until her paperwork was processed. If she&rsquo;d been caught in the U.S. during that time, she would have been deported, and probably barred for life from entering the States.</p>
<p>She had to wait in Canada. Why are Mexican illegals above the law?</p>

<p>Because there are a lot more illegal alien invaders from South of the border and they will vote democratic. Also, I dare say your friend from Canada is White which makes her unwelcome in the U.S.</p>

		<p>I wonder if a group of native <i>White nationalist</i>  protesters who planted themselves in the Senate Office Building would have been treated so delicately by the police and the governmedia.<br>

		<p>Why is it that we have Nazi-like detention camps (channelizing fences, guard towers, &#8216;large empty buildings&rsquo; around the nation which can hold -thousands- and yet which sit empty for no apparent reason?  It can&rsquo;t be because &#8216;it costs too much&rsquo; to feed those who have been bound over for deportation.</p>
<p>I went to an auction the other day, they had everything from road graders to Pace Arrow RVs going for as little as 5,000 bucks each.  Among these were several _buses_.</p>
<p>Auctions held just about every week.  Entire place must&rsquo;ve had 200-300 people in it for the auction, all served by a single sink, drinking fountain and pair of porta johns.</p>
<p>Also present was a concession stand selling burgers for 2.50 and doubles for 5.00</p>
<p>So you arrest as many as are safe for the size of your camp which are all located directly in the border States which transport them less than 20 miles to a camp.  I figure about 10 bucks each way.  Feed them from a concession stand one night.  Say another 10 bucks.  You give them each one &#8216;disaster blanket&rsquo; (pressed wool and synthetics, like a horse blanket) available for 10 bucks each from any Army Surplus Store.</p>
<p>And the next day you take them South on an ex-Trailways/Greyhound type bus for 10,000 bucks, tops.  Refue twice and LEAVE the bloody thing, 500 miles deep in Mexico.  </p>
<p>Before taking a 500 dollar airplane ride back north.</p>
<p>50X20 = 1,000 (gas from local police stations)<br>
400/2/50 = 4 (dollars per person for portapotty rental per day)<br>
50X5 = 250 (burgers)<br>
50X10 = 500 (blankets)<br>
10,000/50 = 2000 (per person for bus purchase)</p>
<p>Total cost to deport 50 people who _do not have IDs_?  11,150 bucks.</p>
<p>Vs. HOW MUCH to keep them on welfare?  Support their medical costs?  Educate them?  Say it averages out to 20 bucks a day.  Multiplied by 365 days a year.  7300 bucks a year X 50 people = </p>
<p>THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR.</p>
<p>_Mexico cannnot refuse these people_.  Because by it&rsquo;s own admission, it considers them sovereign citizens over whom it has NOT relinquished any authority.</p>
<p>What disgusts me is the assertion that this woman &#8216;only felt fear when they actually came to arrest her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What she should be feeling fear for is the certainty that whatever &#8216;college skills&rsquo; she has are _not applicable_ in the kleptocracy of Mexico.  And thus she is UNEMPLOYABLE &#8216;except in the traditional manner&rsquo; once she is dumped there.</p>
<p>The -arrogance- of these people is inherent to their -innocence-.</p>
<p>They seem to honestly believe that their skills are what makes them our equals, &#8216;now and forever&rsquo;.  When in point of fact they are STILL dependent on whites because ONLY whites have the national economy to employ them.</p>
<p>They pretend they are &#8216;so brave&rsquo; for going to Washington DC to tackle the &#8216;big bad federal government&rsquo;.  Yet they don&rsquo;t have the cajones to go back where they came from and depose the REAL white supremacists that ruin their own country.  Because the Federales would slaughter them and dump their bodies in a ditch for thinking they could possibly change the status quo.</p>
<p>Of Mexico.</p>
<p>DREAM should die, in conference for the simple reason that if it doesn&rsquo;t apply to the narco terror state to our South, it shouldn&rsquo;t have to apply here.</p>
<p>And ending the problem would be simple.  Just like it was in 1954.</p>

		<p>My wife is Russian.  I once overstayed my visa by a day when visiting Russia.  I could not get on a flight out of the country until I got the immigration people to extend my visa which took about a day.  They let my family get on a flight but I had to stay.  </p>
<p>It only cost about $25 to fix it but they purposely did not make it easy (good for them).  While I was &#8220;out of status&#8221; (to use Hispanic jargon) I could not leave the country, rent a hotel, conduct any business, etc.  I spend 24 hours in the airport sleeping on a bench designed to sit in.  I was never so glad to leave.  </p>
<p>Once we make it impossible for illegals who don&rsquo;t have a visa to get a higher education, work, travel, conduct business including financial transactions, etc. they will be begging to go home.  Trust me.  </p>

		<p>This is one of the reasons I hate my government.  ICE has made it clear they will not enforce immigration law unless an illegal immigrant has committed a felony.  This is the same federal government that is suing Arizona with the claim that only the federal government, which refuses to enforce immigration law, has the right to enforce immigration law.<br>
