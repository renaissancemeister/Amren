			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, Federation for American Immigration Reform, July 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>FAIR Releases First-of-its-Kind Comprehensive Study of Federal, State and Local Costs of Illegal Immigration</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, July 6 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/  &mdash;  A new study released today by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) estimates that illegal immigration now costs federal and local taxpayers $113 billion a year. The report, The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on U.S. Taxpayers, is the most comprehensive analysis of how much the estimated 13 million illegal aliens and their U.S.-born children cost federal, state and local governments.</p>
<p>The cost estimates are based on an extensive analysis of federal, state and local spending data. The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on U.S. Taxpayers examines dozens of government programs that are available to illegal aliens and their U.S.-born children, both legally and fraudulently. The report provides detailed analysis of the impact of illegal immigration on education, health care, law enforcement and justice, public assistance, and other government programs.</p>
<p>The report also accounts for taxes paid by illegal aliens  &mdash;  about $13 billion a year, resulting in a net cost to taxpayers of about $100 billion. However, the study notes that government at all levels would likely have realized significantly greater revenues if jobs held by illegal aliens had been filled by legal U.S. residents instead.</p>
<p>Federal spending on illegal aliens amounts to $29 billion, finds Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on U.S. Taxpayers. The lion&rsquo;s share of the costs of illegal immigration is borne by state and local taxpayers  &mdash;  an estimated $84.2 billion. In 18 states, expenditures on illegal aliens exceeded the size of those states&rsquo; budget deficits in FY 2009.</p>
<p>Among the key findings of The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on U.S. Taxpayers:</p>
<p>* The $113 billion in outlays for services and benefits to illegal aliens and their families represents an average cost to native-headed households of $1,117 a year. Because the burdens of illegal immigration are not evenly distributed, the costs are much higher in states with large illegal alien populations.</p>
<p>* Education for the children of illegal aliens represents the single largest public expenditure at an annual cost of $52 billion. Nearly all of that cost is absorbed by state and local governments.</p>
<p>* The federal government recoups about one-third of its share of the costs of illegal immigration in the form of taxes collected. States, which bear a much greater share of the costs, recoup a mere 5 percent of their expenditures from taxes paid by illegal aliens.</p>
<p>* Granting amnesty to illegal aliens, as President Obama and others propose, would not significantly increase tax revenues generated by current illegal aliens. However, over time, amnesty would dramatically increase public costs as newly-legalized aliens become eligible for all means-tested government programs.</p>
<p>* Arizona&rsquo;s annual cost of illegal immigration is $2.5 billion. </p>
<p>&#8220;The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on U.S. Taxpayers provides a definitive response to the question of whether illegal aliens are a net benefit or a net drain on government coffers,&#8221; stated Dan Stein president of FAIR. &#8220;The report examines virtually every federal, state and local government program to determine the impact of illegal immigration on the bottom line. That bottom line  &mdash;  $113 billion a year, and growing  &mdash;  makes our nation&rsquo;s failure to control illegal immigration one of the largest preventable burdens borne by American taxpayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If political leaders in Washington and state capitals want to understand why the American public is demanding enforcement of our immigration laws, The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on U.S. Taxpayers, provides 113 billion good reasons,&#8221; Stein concluded.</p>

		<p>The response from the pro illegal immigrant lobby is ridiculous, their claim that the children of illegals should not be counted is preposterous and the best reason to fix the flaw in the 14th amendment.</p>

		<p>The $113 billion means nothing to neo-cons. </p>
<p>If anything, it causes them to celebrate, as they do for anything that keeps currency in motion.</p>
<p>Only things which threaten the circulation of debt-created money worry them, such as an end to mass immigration.</p>

Modern economists and fractional banking have created the largest ponzi scheme in history.</p>
<p>We now need an endless supply of new labor to fund the entitlements of the previous generation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re desperate to make illegals legal. Once legal, the theory goes, these new legals will start paying into the system, sustaining it for maybe one or two generations.</p>
<p>But no ponzi scheme can last. Eventually, you can&rsquo;t take in enough to pay off the entitlements.</p>
<p>Modern economic theory guarantees collapse of the US.</p>

		<p>This is only a partial list since it does not include medical costs which are paid by the taxpayers or passed along in higher premiums. There is also the cost of taking care of the illegals in prison. This report only covers gov. programs.<br>
The smart PR move would be for the Feds to agree to pick up the tab for these services. They won&rsquo;t do it because A) they are too cheap and B)they don&rsquo;t want to admit that these people are an expensive liability, not an asset. It would destroy their lie which no one really believes anyway.<br>
Legal immigrants also cost us a lot of money too.</p>

		<p>Now real Americans see the damage caused by the 1982 Supreme Court decision which forced Texas and all states to provide free public education thru high school to illegal aliens as some kind of constitutional right, even though the aliens had no right to be in any US school district to begin with.</p>
<p> And now Obama wants to shovel more education aid to the states which will be gobbled up by the fast breeding aliens. Education aid by the feds has not been linked to improvement in learning by legal or illegal kids.  Sotommayer, Kagan. Wait for more pro alien decisions from the Supreme Dictators.</p>

		<p>As opposed as I am the the whole concept of the &#8220;world court&#8221;, maybe one approach to dealing with this problem might be to file a claim with the world court for damages against countries that allow their citizens to pilage and plunder our national wealth.  Mexico has plenty of natural resources and, according to Mexico, american drug money.  How about they start paying us damages?  Maybe then, they would be as diligent about keeping their citizens home as they are about keeping foreignors out.  Are you reading this Governor Brewer?</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;And what will they cost us after the amnesty?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>A massive figure the PSM refuse to report, only the usual front page headlines about illegal colonist sob stories.</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;This number is low [current massive welfare spending] compared to the trillions that would be spent if the current 11 million to 12 million illegal immigrants already residing in the U.S. were given amnesty. Less than 50 percent of them have high school degrees. Amnesty would make this population eligible for means-tested welfare as well as other government benefits. The cost to taxpayers would be devastating: Social Security and Medicare costs alone would be $2.6 trillion.</p>
<p>Yet the current regime in power demands amnesty and more welfare entitlements:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Today, welfare spending has risen to nearly 6 percent of GDP, and President Obama is rapidly increasing spending and eligibility for means-tested programs. Under his FY 2011 budget, spending on welfare programs would grow to 42 percent above the level of welfare spending during President Bush&rsquo;s last full year in office (FY 2008). </p>
<p>Critically, most of this increase represents a permanent expansion of the welfare state, not a temporary response to the current recession&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Who are you &#8216;gonna&rsquo; believe, the liars in the government pushing for amnesty, assuring the American people that &#8216;amnesty is needed to improve the economy?&rsquo; That illegal colonists contribute to the tax base? </p>
<p>Or the Heritage Foundation which reports this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The growth of welfare spending is unsustainable and will drive the United States into bankruptcy if allowed to continue&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>But then, that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>Spread the Word and Tell Everyone You Know.  We want White voters as furious and angry as possible.</p>
