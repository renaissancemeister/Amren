<h1><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/27/essence-white-fashion-dir_n_661168.html">Essence&rsquo;s White Fashion Director Ellianna Placas Causes Controversy</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Huffington Post, July 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} Ellianna Placas, formerly of O: The Oprah Magazine and US Weekly is said to be starting at the magazine [Essence] in September, although Essence hasn&rsquo;t made an official announcement. But just the speculation prompted writer Michaela angela Davis to tweet: &#8220;It is with a heavy heavy heart I have learned that Essence magazine has engaged a white fashion director, this hurts, literally, spiritually.&#8221; On Facebook, Davis wrote, &#8220;If there were balance in the industry; if we didn&rsquo;t have a history of being ignored and disrespected; if more mainstream fashion media included people of color before the ONE magazine dedicated to black women &#8216;diversified&rsquo;, it would feel different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fashion media personality Najwa Moses told CLUTCH, &#8220;How could such a prestigious title who is deeply rooted in its target audience let someone who is not even apart of the African Diaspora detonate our image?&#8221; She added, &#8220;How can a White woman dictate and decide what style and beauty is for the Black woman?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Touching words from Michaela Angela Davis, but the only &#8216;imbalance&rsquo; in the industry is at Essence, Ebony and Jet magazines, where there are no &#8216;inclusive&rsquo; faces at all, at least no white ones on the pages, and where anti-white rhetoric is the literal soup of the day, everyday.</p>

		<p>Imagine a White &#8220;fashion personality&#8221; (and what is <i>that</i>, exactly?) saying &ldquo;How can a black woman dictate and decide what style and beauty is for the White woman?&rdquo;  Wonder how the <i>Huffington Post</i> would report <i>that</i> story.</p>
<p>Oh, and &#8220;African diaspora?&#8221;  That brought me the biggest smile I&rsquo;ve had all day!<br>

		<p>I actually had similar feelings when I learned the main fashion director at The Gap was a black male. Let him dictate fashion at FUBU or some other racist black label. Whites and other non-blacks wear Gap clothes. What does a black man know about our fashions?</p>

		<p>I can see the rhetoric now. &#8220;They&rsquo;re trying to drag us back to the plantation, too much blood has been shed by us to go back to slavery and Jim Crow.&#8221;  This quote can be used in every situation from a teenager making a wisecrack about blacks leaving Walmart to a white woman being hired at Essense.</p>

<p>Blacks have, even during the horrors of Jim Crow, the opportunity to start their own businesses and magazines. That they chose instead to force their way into white magazines instead of starting their own is the reason for their lack of progress in this and many other arenas.</p>
<p>As I have point out many times, what is historically white must be destroyed while what is historically black must be preserved at all cost.</p>
<p>I wish more blacks would take the initiative to start their own businesses. I would be willing to leave them alone if they offered me the same consideration.  </p>

		<p>If someone is very experienced in fasion design and can do her job very well, that&rsquo;s all that should matter when deciding on a fashion director: their qualifactions, experience and skills.</p>
<p>The implications of the black response to this news suggest that they could care less if the said magazine hired the most incompetent and careless fasion director &mdash; just so long as she&rsquo;s black, all is well and good.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What can a white woman know about beauty and fashion for black women?&#8221;</p>
<p>Whites should not be able to advise blacks and blacks should not be able to advise whites.</p>
<p>The reasoning for that is very simple.  Both racial groups are so dissimilar they have absolutely nothing in common and most ALL blacks and most ALL whites feel uncomfortable in each other&rsquo;s company, because not only are the intellects drastically different, but they don&rsquo;t share the same kind of humor, interests, music, etc. </p>
<p>This applies to all of the races, incidentally.  None of them can get along with one another&hellip;and they don&rsquo;t really want to.  That&rsquo;s why you see blacks promoting all things black and the importation of blacks from around the world, and mestizos promoting all things Latin, with a rabid desire to have their tribal kinsman overrunning the country by the millions.</p>
<p>Any fool knows this.  Only someone who regards himself as a brilliant elitist is too dimwitted to understand such a basic thing.  That&rsquo;s why this country as a multiracial mish mash of various tribal factions is failing miserably.  And that&rsquo;s why it will be destroyed in its present form.</p>

		<p>I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be worried about fashion magazines showing no white faces. Even blacks wouldn&rsquo;t buy them. All beauty comes from the white race.</p>

		<p>The first question people should ask is; why did the creators of<br>
essence magazine float their company? For profit or for race representation? The answer to this question will go a long way in<br>
settling minds.<br>
USA is a capitalist society. So demography counts. <br>
However I consider it a great deal that inspite of all structural<br>
impediments against the development of blacks that a black owned company is grown well enough to employ people of other races. This way you enlarge your demography. I hope other black companies would consider the economics of what essence has done.<br>
Black businessmen must start considering going back to Africa to invest. You have the demography their. Chinese are doing it. From USA, from Canada, from UK are going back to China to invest, make money and enhance their types.<br>
Think economics folks. See the good side. Good over evil.<br>

		<p>I love this cases.<br>
Come on black community, give us more of that. </p>
<p>Exactly this are the cases making even liberals use their brain again. At one moment they fight with blacks for more black people in high officials. At the other moment the same blacks stand there and say: &#8220;No this is ours. A white person can&rsquo;t do that. This is only for blacks.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I would venture that these photos ( I&rsquo;m sure most of you have seen them already) suggest that a White woman is definitely NOT needed at Essence. These young people have it all together and they&rsquo;re &#8220;keepin&rsquo; it real&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Michael angela Davis?  Huh? <br>
Oh, I get it.  It took me a moment, but I got it.</p>
<p>But let me see now: Najwa Moses.  Is that a pun too?<br>
Sorry, I just don&rsquo;t get it!</p>
<p>And such garbled writing (even aside from logic)! Did these literary people, journalists and such, ever make it to high school?<br>
 &ldquo;How could such a prestigious title who [which] is deeply rooted in its target audience let someone who is not even apart [a part] of the African Diaspora <i>detonate </i> [detonate? wha???] our image?&rdquo; She added, &ldquo;How can a White woman dictate and decide what style and beauty is [are] for the Black woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out how you &#8220;detonate&#8221; an image.  I&rsquo;ll have to work on that a bit more.  Michael-angela was easy.</p>

		<p> What can a White teach a black about beauty?  Straightened hair! Where are doze Afro hairstyles among the blacks? </p>
