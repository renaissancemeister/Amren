			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), July, 2 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>People in developing countries have lower IQs because their bodies divert energy from brainpower to fighting disease, researchers claimed today.</p>
<p>In hot nations blighted by deadly infections, the priority is survival and populations have evolved to develop stronger immune systems rather than intelligence, according to the controversial theory.</p>
<p>Some critics warned the study could become an excuse for racism if it was used to suggest that people in the Third World are not as intelligent as those in cooler, richer climes.</p>
<p>Findings: People from developing nations where heat and disease are prevalent have lower IQs because their bodies focus on survival, researchers have found</p>
<p>Others pointed out that the ancient Persians, Greeks and Romans lived in hot climates and still boasted extraordinary civilisations.</p>
<p>U.S. researchers claimed their work could explain why national IQ scores vary around the world and are lower in some warmer countries stricken by diseases such as malaria, tetanus and tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Infection could have as important an impact on intelligence as education, diet and wealth, said researcher Randy Thornhill and a team from the University of New Mexico.</p>
<p>Children under five use most of their energy for brain development and this can be restricted if the body has to fight disease, they wrote in the Proceedings of the Royal Society.</p>
<p>They compared data from worldwide IQ studies with disease maps drawn up by the World Health Organisation and concluded that the higher the level of infectious disease in a country, the lower the average national IQ.</p>
<p>&#8216;The effect of infectious disease on IQ is bigger than any other single factor we looked at,&rsquo; said Chris Eppig, lead author on the paper.</p>
<p>Disease is a major sap on the body&rsquo;s energy, and the brain takes a lot of energy to build. If you don&rsquo;t have enough, you can&rsquo;t do it properly.</p>
<p>&#8216;The consequence of this, if we&rsquo;re right, is that the IQ of a nation will be largely unaffected until you can lift the burden of disease.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Critics of the study argued there are many different kinds of intelligence that Western academic-based IQ tests fail to measure.</p>
<p>Low IQ does not necessarily equate to stupidity or incompetence, they said. People in hot countries have the intellectual skills to survive in very difficult environments.</p>
<p>The research could be abused to rationalise racism, just as the Nazis perverted scientific study in the 1930s, some critics said.</p>
<p>Experts pointed out that children fighting debilitating disease are likely to miss a lot of school, which could be the real reason for a lower IQ score, not compromised brain development.</p>
<p>Professor Richard Lynn of Ulster University said the picture was complex, with low national IQs partly propagating the spread of infectious diseases.</p>
<p>HIV had a high infection rate in low-IQ nations, he said, because people did not understand how it was contracted and relied on baseless superstitions to avoid it.</p>
<p>Prof Thornhill&rsquo;s work drew headlines ten years ago when his book A Natural History of Rape controversially argued sexual coercion emerged as an evolutionary adaptation.<br>

<p>It seems to me trying to survive constantly would develop more intelligence, not less.</p>
<p>But, it&rsquo;s being admitted they DO have lower I.Q.&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>No matter what kind of &#8220;ism&#8221; it may be, all of them throughout history have a set of lies that are brainwashed into followers, because the fabricated philosophy couldn&rsquo;t exist if the truth were told.  You know, like communism, fascism, socialism, multiculturalism, multiracialism?</p>

		<p>So far as I know blacks in the United States do not suffer significantly more from infectious diseases than whites do (at least in childhood   &mdash;   blacks certainly acquire more STDs).  Yet blacks in the United States still have an average IQ one standard deviation below that of whites.  Wiping out diseases may have a marginal impact on African intelligence but it won&rsquo;t close the gap with whites.</p>

		<p>Populations have &#8220;evolved&#8221; to devolope stronger immune systems rather than intelligence.</p>
<p>This may well be true because the key word is &#8220;evolved&#8221;. </p>
<p>Evolution takes a long peroid of time and waiting around for these people to evolve into intelligent western citizens may be a big mistake. The west exist because certain people (white people) evolved to the point where they could build civilization. </p>

<p>Every time I think that all the tortuously absurd &#8220;reasons&#8221; to explain away black/brown failure have been used up, I can always count on the schizoid sophistry of academia to renew my faith.</p>
<p>It is, though, interesting to see the governmedia beginning to hint   &mdash;   though ever so circumspectly   &mdash;   that the inhabitants of &#8220;developing&#8221; countries (which somehow never do seem to actually develop) actually <i>do</i> have low IQs.</p>
<p>My guess is that the evidence for black/brown low intelligence is slowly becoming too difficult for even the academic mind (sic) to ignore.  So the radical left is preparing to rise to the next level of denial.<br>

		<p>Really?  I mean what is the percentage of the people on this planet who are truly &#8220;surviving?&#8221;  Yes I know there are plenty of people who truly are living at the precipice between surviving and dying, but that is not the case for most people.  </p>
<p>Most of the world&rsquo;s &#8220;poor&#8221; have enough food, an adequate shelter, clothing and a nice television.  They also get to go to school for free.  In many places they have access to free medical care, something I am personally not privileged enough to possess.  </p>
<p>Basically the world&rsquo;s &#8220;poor&#8221; are really not bad off at all.  They have everything you need for human comforts.</p>
<p>PS - I was raised in a two-room house with no indoor toilet, no television, and certainly no free medical care.  I am 28 and grew up in the USA.  I spent lots of time playing and learning.  Our &#8220;poverty&#8221; had nothing to do with my IQ.  We had everything we needed to survive, just like almost everyone else on the planet.  </p>

		<p>Life in Europe was historically very, very hard. Look what the black death did to Europeans in the middle ages. Look at what the potato famine did to Ireland as recently as the 1840&rsquo;s. But somehow Whites managed to build the greatest civilization in the world.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at disease prevalence and health issues in America, where the average IQ is roughly in the high 90s.</p>
<p>1. 1 out of 5 Americans have type 2 genital herpes.<br>
2. 2 out of 3 Americans are considered overweight or obese.<br>
3. There are roughly 1.2 million heart attacks in the US per year.<br>
4. 1 in 5 Americans over the age of 45 has cancer cells in the prostate, which have the potential to develop into turmors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve listed plenty of examples. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary to list anymore, otherwise I would sound redundant.</p>
<p>America has it&rsquo;s share of disease and health issues, as I just demonstrated, but the national IQ isn&rsquo;t low.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt that malnutrition and other difficult circumstances can prevent someone from reaching their genetic potential for intelligence. But even under the best conditions one&rsquo;s intelligence is still limited by genetics. Eating the best food and receiving the best medical care is still not going to make everyone &#8220;smart&#8221;.</p>

<p><br>
Yes. My understanding of Evolutionary theory also tells me that, if indeed struggling for survival and against disease would have a measurable effect on group IQ scores, those scores should by rights be <i>higher</i>, not lower. To that the process should make a group <i>less</i> smart is to (deliberately?) misunderstand and/or misinterpret the process altogether. So this latest alibi for their underdevelopment makes no sense. </p>
<p>But then, as we constantly see from today&rsquo;s PC social sciences, making sense isn&rsquo;t nearly as important as &#8220;making nice&#8221;, i.e. not saying things that might cause offense no matter how true those things might be. </p>

		<p>This has to be the most laughable and convoluted explanation for (obviously) black African intellectual inferiority.</p>
<p>One would have thought that after twenty generations (a black generation being only about fifteen years) of living in North America, that blacks would have thus thrived intellectually. Certainly, anybody who&rsquo;s ever walked the streets of any North American city and observed that the normal condition for blacks is gross obesity, eg too much nutrition, would conclude that blacks should be mental, as well physical, giants. By this theory blacks should have surpassed all other races in intellectual development.</p>
<p>Apparently, anybody who can somehow come up with any irrational explanation for the low intelligence of black Africans, except for the obvious genetic reason, can get a polite audience for this drivel.</p>

<p>Low IQ does not necessarily equate to stupidity or incompetence, they said. People in hot countries have the intellectual skills to survive in very difficult environments.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a persistent canard. The only reason that &#8216;people in hot countries have the skills to survive in difficult environments&rsquo; is because they have never developed the technology that mimimises the dangers of such environments, whereas whites have long learnt to control their environment and no longer need the bug-eating, hole-burrowing &#8216;skills&rsquo; that blacks are still stuck with.  <br>

		<p>There is an interesting genetic response to survival pressure that is obvious but not often talked about in these terms and totally ignored here.</p>
<p>When put under survival pressure, high IQ populations, most notably whites, increase in numbers.  Blacks experience a slash in their numbers as whole populations die off.  Think about what would have happened in haiti, had not whites intervened.</p>
<p>But when survival pressure is removed, white populations shrink while black populations explode.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, I am going to make a couple of predictions that will seem very controversial but I invite people to watch for them over the coming years.  The first is a new white baby boom brought about by our current economic depression.  Right now, there are whites who would otherwise have one or two children, and work on their careers, who are watching their careers disintegrate.  They will be spending alot of time at home&hellip;.having three and four children instead.</p>
<p>The second is a massive die off of non-whites.  It&rsquo;s not predictable what exactly will do it.  But it will probably happen all at once.  It will be something that will need massive white aid in order to stop.  And said aid will no longer be available&hellip;.possibly because the region the aid needs to go to is so enflamed with war that just delivering it will become impossible.</p>
<p>Again, think haiti&hellip;..where they built roadblocks out of dead bodies in order to demand hefty bribes from those of a mind to bring food aid in.</p>

		<p>I think we may be seeing the beginnings of a new agenda movement here. We may now be at the point where I.Q. differences between races can no longer be denied. So the overriding issue now is how to frame these facts in some politically acceptable way, that does not, of course, reference on race itself.</p>

		<p>All of this is irrelevant. In 15-20 years we&rsquo;ll have direct genetic manipulation, so even if they genetically have lower IQs their offspring won&rsquo;t. Besides, the average white southerner only had an IQ of 88 before the first world war and they managed to build a civilization as good if not better than most in the third world today, so clearly other factors are at work here than just &#8220;they are stupid and improvement is impossible.&#8221; If that&rsquo;s your attitude about everything, then you might as well commit suicide since no one has free will or the ability to change over time, IE, evolve.</p>

		<p>For centuries the Chinese were afflicted with disease, famine, and floods.  Nevertheless, they created one of the greatest civilizations in the world.  With no input from the West they developed their own systems of writing, mathematics, metallurgy, and a great literature.  <br>

Currently China outcompetes the United States economically while buying up our national debt.  Chinese Americans tend to perform better on IQ tests than Americans of European descent.   <br>

		<p>Climate has nothing to do with intelligence. Whites have excelled in all climates. Even yet today should whites be banished to the aforementioned Africa. It would become a utopia. Take for example the native Americans homeland, when white settlers arrived the natives were living as primitives. Did the climate suddenly become pristine upon their arrival. Far more recently the issue of apartheid in the dark continent, where whites were in charge to a large degree, things went to hell in no time flat when the country was turned over to the primatives. Note the resemblance of these two words, primatives and primates, words have meanings. Assuming all homo sapiens were on earth nearly the same amount of time and all encountered unfriendly climates, what is the logical conclusion as to differences in acheivements. Alas! we are talking to liberal whites who are severely lacking in logic, thinking with only one half their brains.   </p>

<p>And yet they persist in occupying themselves in an environment where they do not really belong. I think it is called &#8216;squatting&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>Low IQ does not necessarily equate to stupidity or incompetence, they said. People in hot countries have the intellectual skills to survive in very difficult environments.</em></p>
<p>But not such &#8216;intellectual skills&rsquo; to &#8216;survive&rsquo; in an environment in which they do not really belong. Without being forcibly &#8216;enabled&rsquo; by some with an interest in these matters, they would not even pose much of a problem to people who want a nice, quiet, peaceful life.</p>

<p>Godwin&rsquo;s Law! On the other hand, the eugenics that the Nazis championed was almost entirely appropriated by them from prior reasearch. Besides, &#8220;eugenics&#8221; seems to work for the breeding of other species, so why are humans such an exception that it could not work for us?</p>
<p>The specious and dreary &#8216;counter arguments&rsquo; against mongrelisation are just that; specious and dreary.</p>
<p>I would be surprised if most people visiting this site failed to notice the encroachments visited upon our societies nor even the directions in which they generally tend to run.</p>

		<p>Many good comments-and the single factor of IQ which isn&rsquo;t absolute of itself but a co-factor in such personal/individual/familial/communal/societal traits such as,impulse control,sexual behaviours,family stability,rearing of children,roles of masculine/feminine,role of education,cooperation with others(&#8220;a social-contract&#8221;-most often unspoken but known),a degree of altruism,violence etc-a low IQ plus a lack of the positives in the above traits will ALWAYS lead to disaster.</p>
