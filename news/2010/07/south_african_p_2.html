<h1>South African Pupils to Learn in First Language During Early School Years Under New Plan</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Naki, Winnipeg Free Press, July 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>South African students will be able to learn in their first language during early school years under a new government plan  &mdash;  a move that has received a universal welcome in the country.</p>
<p>Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga announced the change Tuesday. She said pupils will have the option of learning in their mother language in their first three years of schooling. Children are currently taught either in English or Afrikaans, both languages inherited from the eras of colonialism and apartheid.</p>
<p>Education experts have been calling for the change for years, as South Africa has nine other official languages. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Motshekga said the current outcomes based education system, known as OBE and introduced in 1998 by the democratic government to replace the apartheid education, is blamed for the high school failure rate, and has been scrapped.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>School pass rates had dropped over the last decade from a 60 per cent average to about 40 per cent at rural areas and black township schools, mainly due to poor learning resources and teaching by underqualified educators.</p>
<p>The legacy of apartheid has left a deep divide in South Africa&rsquo;s education system.</p>
<p>Quality schooling is still largely reserved for whites or rich black people while pupils at the hundreds of schools in poor areas suffer under badly trained teachers with little equipment.</p>
<p>The majority of black schools have no libraries, laboratories, computer centres and have a historic shortage of classrooms and teachers for mathematics and science.</p>
<p>However, the properly resourced former white schools, classified as Model C, have been doing very well with many of them achieving the pass rates of 100 per cent.</p>
<p>The opposition Democratic Alliance says it hopes the changes will be the beginning of a long-needed process to overhaul an education system that was failing pupils.</p>

<p>Do they have equivalent words for tangent, chromosome, sub-atomic practicals like neutrinos?</p>

		<p>Yes, let them learn in one of the nine non-white official languages!  It&rsquo;s better for them and it will hasten the dissolution of the country as nations that have different linguistic groups ALWAYS break apart sooner or later (even mild Czechoslovakia or now Belgium in the making).  Then the whites can have 2-3 chunks of their own.</p>

		<p>Does this mean that students will be segregated into different classrooms or different schools or that they will just use different books or what?  This will be even more regressive than apartheid.  Students who understand only their tribal language will be unable to blend into a modern society that moves primarily in Afrikaans and English.  <br>
Oh, well.  They already have a polygamous Zulu king as President and a health minister who insists that tap water cures HIV.  They might as well immerse the students in Afrocentrism and teach about the ancient Egyptians flying.  </p>

		<p>Excellent, this will effectively keep a large segment of the black population away from whites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pity so many coloreds speak Afrikans, though.</p>

<p>Not true, I&rsquo;m afraid.  The pass rates for several all-black schools have been absolutely zero.  That is to say not one pupil in the whole school achieved a pass. </p>
<p>Another interesting statistic is that when I was in school (further back than I care to remember) the required aggregate pass-rate necessary to achieve university entrance was either 70 or 80%.  An aggregate score of 66% was a good pass. 50% was a fair pass, over 40% was a scrape-through and anything less than 40% was a fail   &mdash;   resulting in the pupil resitting that year.  This, I might add, went for pupils of all colours &hellip; black, white or candy-striped.</p>
<p>The whole system has been dumbed down so thoroughly now, that candidates have to pass three subjects at a minimum of 40 percent and three at a minimum of 30 percent for a university-entrance pass.</p>
<p>Check this out:- </p>
<p>&#8220;Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan set aside 144 billion rand ($19.7 billion), or 17 percent of the budget, for education in the year through March 2010. He plans to increase that by an average 8.6 percent over the next three fiscal years as Zuma, who took office in May and has no formal schooling, pledged to make education a priority. </p>
<p>Higher spending on education hasn&rsquo;t led to a major improvement in literacy. South Africa ranked last out of 40 countries, behind Morocco and Kuwait, in a global study of reading ability of 10 and 11-year-olds published in 2007, according to the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that the words used physics, mathematics, etc, can be created in Zulu, Xhosa, etc. More than likely, these would be loanwords from English or Afrikaans. The problem you then have is to explain the concepts behind these things to a population who probably have an average IQ in the 70 - 80 range. You can imagine the blank stares sweeping across schools in SA. I would imagine that tasks like driving a truck or operating a lathe taught in some of these tribal languages probably use vast numbers of loanwords from Afrikaans or English. </p>
<p>They can create the words, but not the underlying concepts that truly explain what is going on. </p>

<p><i>The legacy of apartheid has left a deep divide in South Africa&rsquo;s education system.</i></p>
<p><br>
As a general rule, ANY article that uses the phrase &#8220;the legacy of apartheid&#8221; may be safely dismissed as liberal propaganda written by Westerners with little to no understanding of what it&rsquo;s like to be outnumbered 9:1 by Bantus. </p>
<p>That said, this article may stand as Exhibit #9271 that, left to their own devices, post-colonial black Africans will NOT avail themselves of the opportunity to elevate themselves to Western styles of living and governing; but will merely &#8220;revert to type.&#8221; The general trend will be regress, not progress; devolution, not evolution. What we are seeing in developments like this, is that the natives are going &#8220;back to the bush.&#8221; </p>
<p>And they are doing so while speaking NINE different languages   &mdash;   only two of which (Afrikaans, English) are WRITTEN languages. <br>

		<p>As backward as this policy appears, one must remember that the AVERAGE IQ in sub-Saharan Africa is 70 - 73. This is considered mentally handicapped in the West. It is a waste of effort to teach Black South Africans from a white cultural point of view. </p>
<p>For these people to survive, they must return to their tribal point in time. For the vast majority, Algebra is useless, they need to know how to live from the land. Entrusting them with modern technology is environmental folly. It is like giving an automatic weapon to a child.</p>

		<p>Both an odd and stupid policy. Former British colonies usually stress English both to allow the nation, eg India, to actively participate in global commerce and education, and to unify the nation of various tribes, sects and linguistic groups.  Nothing prevents Bantu from being taught as another subject in a Bantu area, but how are Bantus supposed to speak to the people who click for a language? </p>
<p> I really don&rsquo;t care; like other posters I hope South Africa falls apart and whites grab a piece of the nation, hopefully with a seaport and some resources, for themselves. Let the rest of the &#8220;South Africans&#8221; apply their advanced science to the cure of  AIDS which will eventually wipe most of them out anyway.</p>

<p>Crazier things are already happening. I&rsquo;ve always suspected that if Americans want to know what their future looks like, they only need to look at South Africa.</p>

		<p>These tribal languages were traditionally learned from oral stories passed down by elders. Whilst many were eventually written, this was based on the phonetic structure of English although some attempts were made in French, German, Dutch and Belgian and were meant to benefit the &#8216;colonists&rsquo; not the indigenous peoples as they obviously already knew the lingo. For these very young students to &#8216;book-learn&rsquo; rather than listen to oral lessons, first they will have to read a written &#8216;foreign&rsquo; text, which rather defeats the object of the exercise. Anyway, these small children would surely have already have learned their own basic vocabulary at their mother&rsquo;s knee, just like the rest of us. This is obviously just another piece of PC anti-White racist legislation which will only harm RSA. But.. it&rsquo;s their country, their future and we can only wait and see how it pans out, not as though it will generate much international interest. Perhaps the myriad of black-african groups in USA and UK would love to lend their support, they too may learn something about their &#8216;roots&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Why should Africans be expected to, as you say, &#8220;elevate themselves to Western styles of living and governing&#8221;? Africans are not Westerners. They are Africans!  Would you try to force your cat to behave like your dog? White people put too much pressure on blacks to conform to white standards of civilized behavior. This explains why black people hate white people, and I have to admit that some of the anti-white hatred is justified.</p>
<p>While this may not be a perfect comparison, comparing the brain of a white to a black, is like comparing the brain of an average white man to the brain of Albert Einstein. What if America&rsquo;s leading scholars told you that you had the same exact intellectual abilities as Albert Einstein? And what if you found yourself unable to solve complex scientific problems that Einstein found to be easy in his day? Who would you blame? Would you blame yourself for failing to understand the scientific problems, despite your best efforts? Or would you lash out against the society that is expecting you to meet intellectual standards that are beyond your abilities?</p>
<p>Blacks in Africa were happy in ancient times, running in their environment, before contact with Europeans. But whites landed on the continent, and tried to force them to adopt this strange thing called &#8220;civilization&#8221;. This must have caused mental anguish, for it was trying to force them to be what they are not. For centuries, Europeans engaged in the ancient art of alchemy, in which they tried to turn ordinary metals into gold. Now, they are trying to turn blacks into civilized people. Whites never learn.  </p>
<p>Blacks should be given their own separate region of the country, where they could live happily, without being forced to meet white civilization&rsquo;s standards. Blacks in Detroit are happy with the type of society that they have created there. How do we know that? They keep voting for the same type of black mayors who have made Detroit the black paradise that it is. A separation wall, like that in Israel, separating white and black societies, would enable each race to live according to its own standards. </p>

		<p>BJohnson I agree with you but do not underestimate the power of JEALOUSY.  Blacks can&rsquo;t understand that Whites create their own prosperity.  All they see is that they have nothing (cause they either break it or steal it) and they resent you for what you have.</p>
<p>The NP sold Apartheid as &#8220;apart maar gelyk&#8221; meaning seperate but equal.  That was one of its critical flaws: they can never be equal!  We are different and we value different things and thinking you can turn them into a bunch of Coconuts (black on the outside but white inside) is ridiculous.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Motshekga said the current outcomes based education system&hellip;is blamed for the high school failure rate, and has been scrapped.</p>
<p>In the US, black failure is blamed on everything from the &#8216;legacy of slavery&rsquo; and White oppression to racist, biased, standardized tests that favor Whites.</p>
<p>In Africa, black failure to achieve is blamed on &#8216;legacy of apartheid&rsquo;, &#8216;legacy of colonialism&rsquo;, and grinding poverty &#8216;caused by Whites.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anyone mentioning the real reason for black failure, low average black IQ, at this time is instantly branded a racist and Nazi.  In the near future any White who dares to cite racial IQ differences may well find himself facing hard prison time as mentioning IQ differences will be outlawed Hate Speech.</p>
<p>Professor Rushton reports this about black IQ in South Africa:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In 1998, I went to Johannesburg, South Africa, to initiate a 5-year series of IQ studies in the university system to determine whether such a low IQ [70] was accurate. I, too, wondered how well all the previous data had been collected.</p>
<p>First, I contacted psychologists in the Faculty of Education at the University of the Witwatersrand (all anti-apartheid liberals) and together we tested hundreds of students of African, East Indian, White, and East Asian backgrounds, along with those of mixed ancestry, under optimal testing procedures, using culture reduced tests. </p>
<p>We used the Raven&rsquo;s Matrices, one of the best known, well researched, and most widely used of all the culture-reduced tests&hellip;. Typically, the test is so easy for university students that they do it in less than 20 minutes. We set no time limit for the test. All those being tested were allowed to complete it.</p>
<p>We found [black] African university students averaged an IQ of 84. In some studies, by other researchers, they have scored lower (IQ = 77). In still others of our studies, highly-selected engineering students who took math and science courses in high school scored higher (IQ = 103)&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/rmrdm</p>
<p>Learning ability IS a reflection of IQ, and as Charles Murray explains in Real Education (p. 48).  Psychomatricians have tried to measure learning ability independent of IQ but have been unsuccessful because the two are so intertwined.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;All the data about the trajectory of IQ scores over the life span indicate that they stabilize around ages six to ten and remain unchanged until old age&hellip;&#8221;</p>
