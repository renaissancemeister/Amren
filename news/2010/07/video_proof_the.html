			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Breitbart, Big Government, July 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In this piece you will see video evidence of racism coming from a federal appointee and NAACP award recipient and in another clip from the same event a perfect rationalization for why the Tea Party needs to exist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>From the beginning of the Tea Party movement, the Left, its aiders and abettors at MSNBC, the NY Times and other reliable left of center propaganda venues, raised race as the driving force behind the movement, even though the evidence was never there. MSNBC even egregiously cut off a black protester&rsquo;s head in a photograph of a man carrying a gun to a rally in order to discuss that anti-black racism was rearing its head in America.</p>
<p>But it got even more blatant when Congressmen Andre Carson and John Lewis and other Congressional Black Caucus members staged a walk through the Tea Party crowd in front of the capitol the day before the health care vote.  They claimed they were threatened by a violent mob and were subjected to the vile N word slur fifteen times. With the unpopularity of the toxic health care bill that the majority of Americans did not want, the Democrats needed a November strategy. Neutralizing the growing Tea Party movement with charges of racism was clearly its post-health care reform vote priority.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>First, my $100,000 video challenge for any evidence of racism was met with crickets. The CBC, looking for a fight, and taking to the airwaves to accuse the Tea Party of racism made a 180 degree turn and went into hiding when challenged on the truthfulness of the outrageous allegations. From camera hogs to ostriches in snap of a finger.</p>
<p>When the media chose to ignore that Representatives Lewis and Carson&rsquo;s story was falling apart, we dug deeper. We found four videos from the moment Rep. Carson claimed the racist Tea Party incident occurred. The four videos, which include audio, show beyond a reasonable doubt that the incident was a manufactured lie. That lie that was supposed to be the centerpiece in the Democratic strategy to destroy the Tea Party. The videos had been available on YouTube almost immediately after the incident occurred and could have been found by any reporter interested in investigating the truthfulness of Rep. Carson&rsquo;s claim.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NAACP and the Congressional Black Caucus do not want racial harmony. They want political victory, and the race card is their Strativarius.</p>
<p>Three months later, the NAACP decided to &#8220;double-down&#8221; on the fabricated &#8220;Tea Party/racism&#8221; narrative and has the gall to include the disproved Capitol Hill &#8220;N Word&#8221; non-incident as their formal condemnation of the Tea Party. {snip}</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s worse. The media that provided the left a platform to accuse the Tea Party, all the while refusing to air any exculpatory evidence. {snip}</p>
<p>But the new media will not be silenced. It will not allow for the main stream media to propagate hateful and hurtful lies in order to save the Democratic Party from the toxic choices it has made over the past few years. And by bringing up race, and demanding a zero tolerance of racism, the left, and the NAACP in particular, has opened itself up for scrutiny.</p>
<p>We are in possession of a video from in which Shirley Sherrod, USDA Georgia Director of Rural Development, speaks at the NAACP Freedom Fund dinner in Georgia. In her meandering speech to what appears to be an all-black audience, this federally appointed executive bureaucrat lays out in stark detail, that her federal duties are managed through the prism of race and class distinctions.</p>
<p>In the first video, Sherrod describes how she racially discriminates against a white farmer. She describes how she is torn over how much she will choose to help him. And, she admits that she doesn&rsquo;t do everything she can for him, because he is white. Eventually, her basic humanity informs that this white man is poor and needs help. But she decides that he should get help from &#8220;one of his own kind&#8221;. She refers him to a white lawyer.</p>
<p>Sherrod&rsquo;s racist tale is received by the NAACP audience with nodding approval and murmurs of recognition and agreement. Hardly the behavior of the group now holding itself up as the supreme judge of another groups&rsquo; racial tolerance.</p>
<p>The second video affirms the real reason there is tension between the Democratic Party and a growing mass of middle Americans  &mdash;  and it&rsquo;s not because of race.</p>
<p>The NAACP which has transformed from a civil rights group to a propaganda arm of the Democratic Party and social-justice politics, supports a new America that relies less on individualism, entrepreneurialism and American grit, but instead giddily embraces, the un-American notion of unaccountability and government dependence. Shirley Sherrod, a federal appointee who oversees over a billion dollars of federal funds, nearly begs black men and women into taking government jobs at USDA  &mdash;  because they won&rsquo;t get fired.</p>

		<p>I agree.  I think they should help &#8220;their kind&#8221; and we should help &#8220;our kind&#8221;.  The only problem is &#8220;Our kind&#8221; also seems to exclusively help &#8220;their kind&#8221; too.  How long are &#8220;our kind&#8221; going to continue on this road of racial suicide? How long is &#8220;our kind&#8221; going to stand these incredible double-standards - one high standard for &#8220;our kind&#8221; and one very low standard for &#8220;their kind&#8221;.  This woman can say anything that she wants and she&rsquo;s not held to account.  Meanwhile groups like the Tea Parties grovel and scrape at the slightest mention of &#8220;racism&#8221;.  Not to go off the subject but the Tea Party&rsquo;s recent obsequious behavior is not becoming and is leading some to believe that it is a movement that is doomed to failure.</p>

		<p>1) Had she been a white federal appointee she would have been fired immediately.</p>
<p>2) The farmer was asking for help from his own kind, the white taxpayer.  </p>
<p>Blacks are net tax consumers.  From their over representation on the welfare rolls to their over representation in local, state and government jobs they take more in taxes than they contribute.  Social Security and the military are often scape-goated as the reason the federal government is going bankrupt.  The real reason is blacks who stay on the government teet from birth to death.</p>

<p>How is that hurting him?  Not having to deal with a black Federal bureaucrat and getting a white one (if there are any left) is the greatest gift of all.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the farmer spoke the way he did because he knew he wasn&rsquo;t going to get through to this woman. The same way some people calling a customer service number will hang up if the voice they hear sounds like an Indian or a black person. They hang up so as not to waste any time explaining him/her self to someone that won&rsquo;t understand or doesn&rsquo;t know how to do the right thing in the computer. But if the farmer was already there in person, I guess he went ahead and gave it his best shot.</p>
<p>Forty years I&rsquo;ve been fed the lie.</p>

		<p>Keep it coming.  The free ride is coming to an end.  After the government is massively downsized I hope Ms. Sherrod ends up cleaning toilets at the local Dennys or making beds at Motel 6. I would like to know why this woman thinks that farmer she mentions in the video was trying to be superior to her simply because he talked for a long time.  Did he have an extensive vocabulary and Ms. Sherrod was unfamiliar with many of the words and therefore she assumed he was trying to be superior?  Did he have a better command of the English language than this affirmative action black history major from Howard? </p>

		<p>There isn&rsquo;t a thimg she said or did that wasn&rsquo;t expected by whites who are racially aware of the outrageous anti-white hatred among nearly all blacks.</p>
<p>The community organizer has staffed his administration with these types and others much worse.  But that was expected also.</p>
<p>The only whites who were unaware anti-white racism would be the norm under Obama are the pitiful fools who supported him in the election and who support him now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if the conservative talk show hosts are going to open up and tell it like it really is, revealing black racism just like Breitbart did.</p>
<p>Personally I&rsquo;m fed up with these black Jeremiah Wright look-a-likes and would love to see them go after whites physically.  In sync with the L.A. riots, all across the country, they thought the starting bell had rung and were pulling people out of cars and assaulting them, stupidly believing they had the power to win a civil war.  Will they be that stupid once more?  I hope so.  </p>

		<p>This confirms what I have thought for years, blacks will not help you and you are pretty much on your own. Worse yet you will be spoken to in a rude, hostile and condescending tone and God help you if you ask to speak with a supervisor or to someone else. This is especially the case if you unfortunately fall on hard times and end up having to seek some sort of federal assistance. More than likely you will be either turned down flat (making too much money or some other plausible excuse) or just referred to the local food bank. Even if you are approved it will probably be for less than what you actually qualify for. For example- about 6 years ago I had some hard times and applied for food stamps. I was given the assistance but when I asked about the free bus pass that was part of the assitance package I was rudely told that I did not qualify for it. I did not press the issue since I was just glad to get the help I needed. </p>

<p>&#8220;The NAACP, an undeniable weapon in the Democratic Party&rsquo;s arsenal, was more than happy to exploit this nation&rsquo;s sensitive racial schism for possible political gain. The Democratic Party and the NAACP, needless to say, are playing with fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nope, wrong again.   There is not hot fire of White Anger out there.  Whites know that their country is now brown and getting browner, and there is nothing they can do about it except try and hide from the Muslim&rsquo;s scimitar and the gang bangers bullets.</p>
<p>Whites gave away their country in 1954, and there&rsquo;s no taking it back. The non whites have reached critical mass, and they now have the power. </p>
<p>They Great Race has passed into slavery.</p>
<p>White children keep chanting &#8220;Diversity is our Strength&#8221; while planning to make as many mulatto babies as possible. They think that a black government employee who promotes social justice by tearing down White Privilege is &#8220;the right thing to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>White children are sent to Interfaith camps and learn how to &#8220;atone for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privileges.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
God, the more I think about it, the less I care.  There&rsquo;s no solution when your own White Humanity volunteers for mass racial suicide.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had our run.  Now all we can do is enjoy poetic justice as the Diversity Curse occasionally visits the White Liberal Elites and the segregated White synagogues.</p>

In a nutshell, this is what USDA &#8220;Federal Employee&#8221; Shirley Sherrod was trying to say in regards to &#8220;public&#8221; tax money, the bulk of which comes from &#8220;white taxpayers&#8221;.</p>
<p> &#8220;White People just give uzzz&rsquo; da&rsquo; tax money so weeez cun&rsquo; spend it to help our own kind&#8221;. </p>
<p> &#8220;And if da&rsquo; white man wants money&hellip; let another white help em&rsquo; out whitt his &#8220;own&#8221; money&#8221;.</p>
<p>The overall message in her speech&hellip;&#8221; Tax money is black people&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>Ain&rsquo;t never seen a black USDA nothin&rsquo; when I lived in rural Maine. Ahhhh, those were the days.</p>

		<p>When I was a child an older black woman told me that when they take over I would be her slave.I always remembered that and as the neighborhood changed and they gained more control the social rules changed in the hood.These leaders should be honorable and fair but as the video shows the bias is on the other side now.Who knows maybe one day the attorney general will be bragging about how he told the white people they were going to take a shower and then he gassed them.</p>

		<p>Everyone would love for renewable energies to take the place of fossil fuels. They are not quite there yet. Economically viable renewable energy is still 5-15 years away. Fossil fuels are still so much cheaper (even with all of the environmental problems). The US and Europe cannot compete against India, China, &amp; Latin America when their labor (and energy) is so much cheaper than ours. We simply cannot switch to &#8216;renewable sources&rsquo; until they actually make sense. By the way, most consumers (all of us Walmart shoppers) always prefer the cheaper way!!!!!</p>

		<p>We can only imagine what that poor white farmer might have said that she thought he was trying to act &#8220;superior&#8221;.  Maybe he used a word she did not recognize.  Most likely the very fact that he was white was enough, in her eyes, to make him &#8220;act superior&#8221;.</p>

<p>Fox reported this on O&rsquo;Reilly, Hannity and Greta, but they left out the more damaging, racist remark above.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a mistake.  Every black racist remark should be reported from now on, but it won&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Fox is reporting on a lot of it, but they&rsquo;re still  not getting a substantial portion. And, it seems, like now, they don&rsquo;t reveal everything that is said and done.</p>

		<p>There is nothing racist about talking about the race of people involved, but it is racist for this woman to not do all that she could to help the farmer because she was thinking that he is White and some black farmers had lost their land over the years.</p>
<p>We need more people to openly discuss race and all of its implications, rather than trying to smear anyone who mentions race as racist.</p>
<p>For example, if race is taken into account, we learn that White students are still performing in our supposedly failing public schools. With an honest assessment based on race, administrators could acknowledge that Latino and blacks are the ones who are failing IN our schools, and it is not the schools failing them. Asians and Whites repeatedly do just fine in the same schools that blacks and Latinos cause to be labeled as failures.</p>
<p>The same is true for AIDS, illegitimate births and crime statistics. Account for race and gender and you see a much more clear picture of the reality that America has become.</p>

		<p>What you are seeing here is not racism, but hypocrisy.  &#8220;Racism&#8221; is now a meaningless term used as an epithet.  Races, nationalities, ethnicities, taking care of their own is not only normal and good, but is really something that extends from the very nature of the phenomena those terms describe.</p>
<p>Rank and file blacks tend to believe what their race huckster leaders certainly don&rsquo;t: that Whites owe them something. Similarly, rank and file White marxists conceitedly assert that they are above the concept of race, and paternally owe the black something.  Their task masters, however, believe in nothing but power.</p>
<p>Militant, race baiting non Whites attempt to provoke Whites because their White marxist masters have engineered a system that benefits them from doing so.  As I have stated many times in this forum, the non White, even the dysfunctional non White is not a threat the the White race.  It is the White marxist that wishes to destroy the White man.  We are in a civil war, not a race war.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We can only imagine what that poor white farmer might have said that she thought he was trying to act &ldquo;superior&rdquo;&hellip; Most likely the very fact that he was white was enough, in her eyes, to make him &ldquo;act superior&rdquo;.</p>

		<p>Over the past couple of years of Obama&rsquo;s presidential campaign and the beginning of his first term, the GOP and its allies in the media have shown real restraint in not exploiting race to their political benefit. I think any honest, objective analysis would show that.</p>
<p>The cracks in this &#8220;post-racial&#8221; Obama era started to appear when the left seized on each and every insignificant &#8220;racist&#8221; poster that appeared at any Tea Party rally. Blowing them way out of proportion, the left started the racism ball rolling, making grassroots conservatives feel resentful and defensive, and rightly so.</p>
<p>Then there was Arizona&rsquo;s SB 1070, against which came a very loud and shrill, coordinated attack by the cultural Marxists in the mainstream media to try and badger and shame the vast majority of the country which supports Arizona&rsquo;s law. Many people see now that all that media noise and fury was nothing but race-based fear mongering. They see it in the fact that the DoJ isn&rsquo;t even including an argument regarding racial profiling in their lawsuit against SB 1070.</p>
<p>And now we see the left going on the offensive using race again, when the NAACP recently targeted the Tea Party movement for being &#8220;racist.&#8221; </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s high time for the right to strike back on this issue, and Breitbart&rsquo;s NAACP video hits just the right note. And no one can plausibly argue that the right is playing unfairly - the most public histrionics about racism have all been coming from the left thus far. I think the left will rue the day when they unfairly smeared the Tea Partiers as racist, and unfairly smeared the majority of Americans who support Arizona&rsquo;s law as racist.</p>
<p>It is ironic perhaps that those who ended Obama&rsquo;s attempt at a &#8220;post-racial&#8221; era were his most vocal, strident, race conscious supporters. That&rsquo;s all over now, and they have no one to blame but themselves. I think we&rsquo;re in uncharted waters, and it will be interesting to say the least to see where this country is headed now that race issues are in the air&hellip;</p>

		<p>Can anyone who visits this site regularly say that he/she has not encountered this kind of blatant racism at work, at school, or elsewhere? </p>
<p>I have been teaching in higher education for twenty years, and I had become so accustomed to bash-and-kick-Whitey behavior, from administration and students, that I became numb to it. I had just come to accept the sad and most unfortunate status quo. I have been unemployed for 2010; as a White male English instructor, I question whether I will be employed at all while Obama is the HNIC.</p>
<p>During the 2008 Obama excitement, my immediate supervisor  &mdash;  a large and loud Black woman who looks very much like our friend here  &mdash;  incessantly shoved Obama down my throat in a mentionably unconstitutional manner. She was as evil as she was unprofessional in everything she did. Everything.</p>
<p>The so-called canon of American literature in colleges now includes Stokley Carmichael&rsquo;s call to &#8220;roll over&#8221; on Whitey and Maya Angelous&rsquo;s story about Joe Louis&rsquo;s proving that &#8220;we [blacks} are the strongest people in the world,&#8221; and The Reverend Doctor Michael/Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s largely plagiarized &#8220;I Have A Dream&#8221; speech. </p>
<p>O.J. gets to decapitate his wife; blacks are expected to riot regularly; and this broad gets to publicly boast about this downright nefarious behavior. </p>

		<p>This is exactly the sort of thing that has helped destroy the Postal Service.  Anywhere Blacks get power over Whites, they misuse it.  This is where all our well-intentioned, self sacrifice has gotten us with those people.  I&rsquo;m really starting to think Obama&rsquo;s presidency is a blessing because Whites all over this country are starting to see the realities of race that only too few of us who live with it day to day have seen for a long while.  I only wonder how this all plays out as Blacks finally start to be heald accountable for their own racism.</p>

		<p>I sense the awakening of a good many whites in this country and the outcome is bad news for blacks. There is a feeling, I believe, that after 50 years and billions of dollars it added up to nothing more than a failed black culture expecting to be cared for - cradle to grave - by whites who they hate because of their own African inferiority. </p>
<p>OK - that much is obvious. But also, the absolutely destructive liberal policies over the last 50 years have essentially brought this country to the edge of bankruptcy as blacks consume more and more, demand more and more, and return less and less. </p>
<p>Amazingly, blacks remain somehow ignorant of the fact that whatever isolated achievements they have made in academics or employment have come at the hands of whites through affirmative action or other pretend accomplishments.</p>
<p>Soon, the money will either run out or whites will simply put a stop to the handouts. The result will be a collapse of black society in America until some adaptations are made. </p>
<p>And this time, violence or the threat of violence will be met head on by whites whose tolerance has ended.</p>
<p>Any race-war scenario is rather ridiculous - an enemy can&rsquo;t really organize or plan if its army has an average IQ of 75 and the impulse control skills of 12 year-olds. Blacks fail to realize they are not only outnumbered, but out-financed and under-educated.</p>
<p>A good example of what will happen comes from South Africa, circa 1960, when a small population of whites totally controlled a massive population of blacks. </p>
<p>The end result will be a self-segregation of the races as black hubris gives way to simple survival.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a scientific fact that black crime rates, dropout rates, presence on the welfare rolls, etc. were all a lot lower in the days of segregation. Things were a lot better in those days, for both whites and blacks. Blacks had their own schools, their own restaurants, their own churches (they still have that - funny how they don&rsquo;t mind THAT being segregated), and their own part of town which they informally policed themselves. If they left whitey alone, whitey didn&rsquo;t bother them. If a black man was ambitious he could start his own business in that part of town. The trouble only started when Communist snivel rights instigators swooped in and began stirring the blacks up, filling their minds with delusions of power in order to achieve their (the Communists&rsquo;) own selfish goals.</p>
<p>Blacks simply cannot handle power as well as whites can - and if they get it they *will* find that they ended up with more than they bargained for.</p>

		<p>&#8220;blacks will not help you and you are pretty much on your own. Worse, you will be spoken to in a rude, hostile and condescending tone &hellip;This is especially the case if you fall on hard times and end up having to seek some sort of assistance. More than likely you will be turned down flat. Even if you are approved, it will probably be for less than what you actually qualify for. For example - about 6 years ago I had some hard times and applied for food stamps. I was given the assistance but when I asked about the free bus pass that was part of the package I was rudely told that I did not qualify for it.&#8221;<br>

<p>I can identify with that. Don&rsquo;t expect any help or sympathy from blacks. If you&rsquo;re having a hard time, some of them will gloat at their chance to step on you.  It&rsquo;s their chance to &#8220;get even&#8221; with whitey. If you have good manners, grammar, or appear educated or (in their opinion) &#8220;uppity&#8221;, it will go all the worse for you.</p>
<p><br>
Some years ago, I was laid off  by a company that &#8220;downsized&#8221; and I was encountering great difficulty obtaining unemployment insurance.  For the time being, I had zero income. There was a store-front operation in the neighborhood, giving out free sandwiches and lunch boxes for &#8220;all neighborhood people in need&#8221;.  Well,  I was a neighborhood person in need.  I walked in and inquired about the sandwich. The black man in charge took one look at me and snarled in the nastiest tones:  </p>
<p>&hellip;&#8221;YOU?   GET OUT!!!&#8221;   </p>
<p>Those were his exact words, and I&rsquo;ll never forget them.  It was an education.</p>
<p>Another time, a Korean fruit shop owner had discarded some bruised peaches in the garbage. I picked one of them out of the garbage, and the black security guard (who saw me take it from the garbage) grabbed me and started yelling that I had stolen a peach. He KNEW that I got that peach from the garbage, he saw it. The Korean owner declined to prosecute because he also knew the peach was what he had thrown out.</p>
<p>These incidents occurred during a temporary downturn in my life, which could happen to anyone, but I have never forgotten them. I have done very well since then and it&rsquo;s all in the past;  but what I learned was that blacks may fawn on you when you&rsquo;re on top and they&rsquo;re hoping to get tips, but they will step on you when you&rsquo;re on the bottom and they think they can get away with it. They will not only step on a white person,  they will do it WITH RELISH.   Take care, white man, that you don&rsquo;t find yourself on the bottom!</p>

There will be hell to pay down the road if things turn seriously Yugoslavian. There is a lot of drug money involved and unlimited firepower.

		<p>As Blacks have gained more power they are doing what is expected, showing the hostility and hate that they have for Whites.  The more power they get the more they will abuse it.  I&rsquo;ve had so many situations with Blacks that I can&rsquo;t even count them - living in a major U.S. city as I do.  In city, state and federal agencies they are rude, hostile and show no desire to assist Whites.  I was once attacked on the street BY Black youths.  I was fortunate enough to be near a large school and got assistance.  My nose was broken.  The Black ambulance woman (I wouldn&rsquo;t call her an EMT, she was not an EMT) had a big smile on her face.  Were they Black?, she asked with a chuckle.  In hospitals the Black affirmative action nurses are often hostile to White patients especially if they&rsquo;re old and the Black knows that they&rsquo;re helpless.  If they&rsquo;re not hostile and arrogant then you can at the very least expect a lower level of competency.  Once I went to a Salvation Army store to donate clothes.  One of the other people pointed towards a Black woman behind a counter.  I went to the counter and she was behind the counter having a personal conversation on the phone.  I waited about 3 minutes before I said something.  She responded with a hostile, &#8220;Can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m on the phone!?&#8221;  </p>
<p>This is only the beginning.  The war hasn&rsquo;t even started yet.  You know what the problem is, one of them anyway, that is that many Whites have not been the victim of these sorts of events.  Every time I hear about a White that has been attacked or raped by a Black (When the news outlets decide to indicate the perpetrators race that is)  I say &#8220;Good&#8221;.  I know that might sound cruel, but unfortunately the only way Whites are ever going to realize what is transpiring is for them to experience what Blacks really are.  I really look at the future and the future seems very bleak.  It&rsquo;s like people who haven&rsquo;t gone through these things (mostly liberals) just don&rsquo;t seem to care unless it affects them.  And the liberals that have been victimized, just keep rationalizing that somehow it all works - while they&rsquo;re moving to another neighborhood, city, state, etc. to get further away from the problem.  When are people going to stand up and fight?</p>

		<p>The non-stop incidents of unpunished Black-on-White in-your-face hate-crime will continue unabated as long as no effective and meaningful counter-action is implemented.</p>
<p>Until such times as secession is achieved, such counter-action must come in the form of moral and legal challenges where appropriate, the continued exposure via the Internet of all incidents of Black-on-White hate-crime and calls for the prosecution and/or sacking of the perpetrators.  In other words, exactly the same tactics as Blacks use against Whites.</p>
<p>On a more ominous note, Blacks have <b>not</b> gotten where they are in the power game today by their own efforts. </p>
<p>Prior to their civil rights movements of the 1950s and 60s incidently created, funded and directed by non-Blacks, their sports sponsorships, exclusive Black education/medical centres and business enterprise efforts were also predominately funded AND directed in advisory capacities mainly by a specific, but not entirely so, non-Black ethnicity. </p>
<p>At some stage, the Blacks&rsquo; benefactors are inevitably sure to start turning their attention to a new underdog with a louder bark and more aggressive streak, upon which to shower their benevolence for a change.<br>
