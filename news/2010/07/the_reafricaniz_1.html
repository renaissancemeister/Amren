<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There is nothing new under the sun. The radicals of the 1960s who championed sexual liberation and called marriage a &#8220;system of oppression&#8221; imagined they were doing something revolutionary  &mdash;  and in a sense they were, but feminism and the sexual revolution have led to the reemergence within the white world of a more primitive family system long observed in Africa.</p>
<p><b>A forgotten warning</b></p>
<p>About the middle of the &#8220;roaring twenties,&#8221; the eminent literary critic Irving Babbitt issued a warning:<blockquote>&#8220;Sexual unrestraint is wreaking fearful havoc to society. The resultant diseases are a menace to the future of the white race. There is an undoubted connection between a certain type of self-indulgent individualism and an unduly declining birthrate. The French and also the Americans of native descent are, if we are to trust statistics, in danger of withering from the earth. Where the population is increasing, it is, we are told, at the expense of quality. The stocks to which the past has looked for its leaders are dying out and the inferior or even degenerate breeds are multiplying.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote><p>As for remedies, Babbitt acknowledged that people are not usually motivated by &#8220;such general grounds as the good of the white race menaced by &#8216;the rising tide of color&rsquo; &#8221; (alluding to Lothrop Stoddard&rsquo;s then-recent book  &mdash;  see &#8220;A Warning from the Past,&#8221; <a href="/ar/2000/01/index.html#cover" target="stoddard" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>AR, Jan. 2000</b></a>). He proposed that traditional ideals of self restraint  &mdash;  continence and monogamy  &mdash;  would be of greater racial benefit than explicitly eugenic considerations.</p>

</div><p>Today the sexual situation in the Western world has reached a state worse than Babbitt could have imagined possible, and his warnings are more timely than ever  &mdash;  and his skepticism about explicitly racial solutions is still warranted. Normal people do not make decisions about marriage and children on the basis of scientific findings or because of racial politics.</p>
<p>The problem is not intermarriage. Only about 1 percent of whites marry outside their race and just 0.4 percent of whites marry blacks (though these rates are much higher than in 1880, when only one in a thousand whites married out). On the other hand, vast numbers of Western women are either not reproducing or doing so at below-replacement level. Some racially conscious whites seem to be more concerned about one interracial union than 50 childless white couples. I believe it is because they can see the occasional white mother pushing a mixed-race baby in a stroller, whereas they cannot see the children other white women are <em>not</em> having. The greatest threats to a nation do not always strike the eye.</p>
<p>Racially conscious whites also object to the small number of white men who go to the trouble and expense of seeking wives in exotic places such as the Philippines and South America. Calling such men &#8220;race traitors&#8221; only alienates our natural constituents  &mdash;  whites unfamiliar with racial realism but potentially sympathetic to our cause  &mdash;  without establishing a single new white family. Most of these men go overseas because women in more traditional societies are more submissive, more feminine, and give family life higher priority than our women do.</p>

</table><p>The problem lies elsewhere, mainly in what is known as feminism. It is this, I believe, that mainly explains collapsing white birthrates. For several decades, white women have been reared in an unprecedented manner: They have been encouraged to do almost anything <em>but</em> marry and have children. It is extremely difficult for any society to make its young women unattractive to its own young men, but the West now appears close to succeeding (an achievement attributable, no doubt, to our high IQs).</p>
<p>Experts report that in cases involving child custody women initiate divorce almost every time. Courts routinely award them custody and generous child support payments regardless of whether the man is at fault. Under these conditions it is futile to scold men that it is their &#8220;racial duty&#8221; to marry. Men do not have such a duty, and outside the tiny ranks of the hard core, such exhortations would be futile. The ordinary white man who does not read <cite>American Renaissance</cite> or perhaps even think much about race will be more encouraged to marry a white woman and start a family as his ancestors did only if the effects of feminism can be undone.</p>
<p>Feminism has encouraged the erosion of traditional Christian and European standards of conduct and has replaced them with a polygamous mating pattern in which women compete for the most attractive men. This is something we see in primate packs, but even among humans, polygamous societies are nothing new, and a great deal is known about how they operate. It so happens that the most polygamous part of the world is West Africa, the ancestral homeland of America&rsquo;s own black population. A look at these societies may shed light on what is happening in the West today under the influence of &#8220;women&rsquo;s liberation.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Polygamous West Africa</b></p>
<p>An unusual feature of the region is that women produce nearly all the food: one anthropologist calls it &#8220;the region of female farming <i>par excellence.</i>&#8221; That is not because Africans have a progressive belief in careers for women, but because West African agriculture is very simple. Cultivation tends to be extensive rather than intensive, and the principle tools are hoes, which women can use as easily as men. The more challenging climate of Europe calls for intensive plough cultivation, which made women dependent on men for food.</p>
<p>There is, of course, much variety in family patterns among West Africans, but a number of generalizations are possible. Since West African women can provide for themselves, and often for their husbands as well, men do not need to worry about the cost of taking multiple wives. Contrary to what we might expect, a wife may even encourage her husband to marry another woman, since that usually relieves her of some of her chores. The men enjoy considerable leisure, which they can devote to politicking, fighting, drinking, and the pursuit of what ethnographers delicately refer to as &#8220;polycoity.&#8221;</p>

</div><p>A Dutch traveler left an amusing description of the typical polygamist on the 17th century Gold Coast, who &#8220;idly spends his time in impertinent tattling (the woman&rsquo;s business in our country) and drinking of palm-wine, which the poor wives are frequently obliged to raise money to pay for, and by their hard labor maintain and satisfy these lazy wretches in their greedy thirst after wines.&#8221; Traditionally, husbands need not share personal earnings with their wives; the definition of marriage does not include community of property.</p>
<p>There is a disincentive for polygamous husbands to spend too much time with any particular wife, as this would tend to provoke jealousy among the rest and interfere with the smooth functioning of the household. On the other hand, in a polygamous society there are plenty of footloose bachelors who are willing to keep lonely wives company. The distinction between licit and illicit relations may become blurred, and men and women lose any notion of a permanent marriage bond. Some simply have &#8220;relationships,&#8221; of a kind not unknown among certain populations in this country.</p>
<p>The result is that paternity tends to be uncertain. Men therefore do not put much effort into fatherhood; why should they, when they do not know whether the children are their own? In some cases, men devote more time and effort to their sisters&rsquo; children. No matter how uncertain a man may be about his own children, there can be no doubt about kinship through a sister&rsquo;s line.</p>

</table><p>The greater role of the mother leads to what anthropologists call &#8220;matrifocal&#8221; families, but this does not necessarily mean mothers make up for the lack of interest shown by fathers. They are often content to delegate care of their offspring to older relatives or friends to whom they pay a modest fee. This practice, known as &#8220;fosterage,&#8221; is in no way seen as dereliction of a mother&rsquo;s duties.</p>
<p>Fosterage can begin when the child is quite young, since early weaning allows the mother to return to fertility sooner. Relieved of her child, she is able to devote her full attention to having another. In other words, the effort she saves on childrearing goes into child<em>bearing.</em></p>
<p>Western humanitarians worry about what seems to them the scandalous poverty of Africa and are anxious to relieve it. They are sometimes surprised to learn that Africans themselves do not share their concerns. Parents seem confident their children will get along somehow. This could be a racial trait, but it is no doubt reinforced by fosterage: Parents who delegate care of their children do not feel the same need to husband their own resources. Once the children are out of the house, the mother (and father) may not have much contact with them. The result is a large number of somewhat loosely reared children.</p>
<p>The simpler and more spontaneous culture of West Africa may be able to get along in this fashion, but Western Civilization grew out of different norms. The achievements that form our cultural heritage presuppose stable social arrangements. Predictable familial and civic relations, long apprenticeships, and capital accumulation are what allow men of talent to invest time and effort in endeavors that do not necessarily have a quick or obvious payoff. That makes the arts and sciences possible.</p>
<p><b>Reafricanization?</b></p>
<p>It may be that Europeans are better adapted through evolutionary pressures to monogamy and deferred gratification, but it would be well not to presume too much upon this. One of the reasons for studying Africa is that it is like a window onto our own remote past. During declining phases of civilization, primitive cultural forms tend to reappear. Whites are not immune to what might be called &#8220;reafricanization,&#8221; and there is evidence that something like it is taking place now. Western man is in certain ways returning spiritually to the continent from which he emerged.</p>
<p>In the first place, let us consider the contemporary West&rsquo;s obvious and abnormal preoccupation with sex. Anthropologists speak of reproductive effort as a combination of mating effort and parenting effort. There is a natural tradeoff between the two. The less time people spend looking for mates, the more they have left to devote to their children. The traditional European practice is to encourage young people to pair off early and emphasize fidelity in order to reduce sexual competition and allow adults to concentrate on the serious business of raising families.</p>

</div><p>This is not a universal human pattern. On average, Africans appear to make the tradeoff between mating effort and parenting effort differently, with the result that sex assumes greater importance over a longer period of time. White writers of earlier days frequently noted the prominence of sex in the black man&rsquo;s thoughts; when recalled now, these observations are cited with horror. In fact, early observers were reporting what they found, and what is still noted by professional anthropologists today.</p>
<p>As monogamy decays in the West, our mating system increasingly comes to resemble the more competitive African model, and with similar results. Young women devote more effort to maximizing their allure in order to snag high-status men, and men compete for status in order to attract these women. This comes at the expense of childrearing and family life.</p>
<p>At the same time, the feminist program of cajoling women into the workplace means they become self-supporting, as are the female farmers of West Africa. The <cite>Dilbert</cite> world of work cubicles may not resemble the farming plots of Africa, but both stand in marked contrast to the male-breadwinner tradition of the West, in which childrearing was a woman&rsquo;s most important duty. Indeed, the modern workplace, optimized for risk-free, repetitious, sedentary work is probably the best environment for eliminating women&rsquo;s economic dependence upon men. By the same token, it discourages the moderately large families of well-brought-up children that are the indispensable preconditions of Western Civilization. If enough women fail or refuse to marry and become mothers of such families, our way of life cannot be sustained.</p>

</table><p>The most important effect of economic autonomy upon women is that it reduces the benefits to them of monogamous marriage. They can mate as they please, in competition for the most attractive men. That is what the college &#8220;hook-up&#8221; scene is really about  &mdash;  it is not callous men preying upon wide-eyed virgins. Later, women use affluent men for their resources (either not marrying or marrying and then divorcing them). In any case, economic independence means they do not need a man in the same way previous generations of women did.</p>
<p>A second economic factor influencing female family behavior is easy consumer credit. Using a credit card is a little like providing for African children through fosterage. It shields young, present-oriented women from the need for frugality.</p>
<p>The American economy is fueled to a great extent by massive consumer debt. How much of this spending is by married men with children to support? Feminists complain that men continue to earn more than women, but they say little about which sex <em>spends</em> more. And, of course, the more time and effort women devote to careers and personal consumption, the less they have for the children they do manage to bear. The problem of &#8220;latchkey children,&#8221; raised by television sets and peer groups, was a predictable result of feminism.</p>
<p>To summarize, the contemporary West resembles traditional West African society in:</p>
<p>1. female economic self-support;<br>
2. polygamous and unstable mating patterns;<br>
3. absence of long-term planning;<br>
4. low-investment parenting.</p>
<p><b>Polygamy without children</b></p>
<p>All analogies break down at some point, however, and when this one does it is to the credit of Africans rather than to us. The African system does not produce an advanced civilization, but it does at least ensure procreation, which is more than can be said for our present way of life. Africans may not sacrifice all that much for their offspring, but they <em>are</em> extremely fond of children. They have a proverb: &#8220;If you have a child, you have a life.&#8221; One of the justifications they offer for fosterage is that without it the poor foster-parent would be deprived of the happiness children bring. Africans not only want to have children; they want to share them with friends and neighbors. Efforts by Western busybodies to interest them in birth control, therefore, have not met with much success: 14 of the 16 most fertile countries in the world are in black Africa.</p>
<p>Sociobiologists speak of high-investment versus high-fertility reproductive strategies, but it is clear the contemporary West does not fall into either category. We are practicing both low fertility and low parental investment. It is uncanny how many of the &#8220;progressive&#8221; causes being pushed among us involve thwarting procreation: female careerism, unrestricted abortion, so-called safe sex, and special political protections for homosexuality. A society that makes these things its priorities can only have a death wish.</p>

</table><p>It is worth noting, however, that disordered childrearing is not universal in America. Many middle-class, college-educated, suburban women seem to understand instinctively that their children will get the best start in life only if they are reared by two adults who stick together through good times and bad, and who dedicate themselves to being parents. Among certain women  &mdash;  mainly white women  &mdash;  there is a growing realization that &#8220;alternative families&#8221; are not families at all, and that the old-fashioned ways reflected an ancient wisdom. Among college-educated women, divorce rates stopped rising in the 1980s and began to decline in the 1990s. As illegitimacy rates climbed to 70 percent for blacks and 45 percent for Hispanics, they peaked at just 4 percent for college-educated women, and then headed down. This rearguard action against collapse has not, however, gone all the way. These dedicated, neo-traditional parents usually have only two children or, at most, three.</p>
<p>Our task is to restore the monogamous heterosexual family as the normal social unit in Western society. The most important form of racial activism, after all, is childrearing. This goal will be achieved neither by denouncing &#8220;race traitors&#8221; nor by harping on racial differences in IQ. Instead, we must consider the actual incentives that drive women  &mdash;  who are the real choosers in the mating dance  &mdash;  and focus our efforts on altering them in ways that encourage family formation.</p>
<p>Why, for example, do white women take up with black men? Like men who search for foreign wives, they do it for a reason. Much has been written even by mainstream conservatives about the injustice of so-called affirmative action, but I have never seen a direct discussion of its sexual consequences. Given the natural female attraction to men with status, there will be consequences. Our current system subordinates the interests of whites to those of blacks. At the same time, whites must watch their words to avoid &#8220;offending&#8221; blacks, but not vice versa. Women see this; they have a keen sense of which males are dominant. Again, changing the incentives to which these women respond will be more effective than scolding or exhortation.</p>
<p>In contrast to European nationalists, American race realists have not yet had political success. When we do gain influence, we will have many more important things to worry about than mixed-race marriages or men who seek Venezuelan brides: things such as how to dismantle 50 years of &#8220;civil rights&#8221; legislation, the repatriation of millions of aliens, and ending anti-white indoctrination in our schools.</p>
<p>Many racially conscious whites worry about the absence of women in our ranks, but I believe they have it backwards. We do not need women on our side to succeed politically; we need to succeed politically to have women on our side. As soon as we start winning, the ladies will find our arguments plausible, our faces handsome, and our jokes witty. Direct political action by women is not part of the European tradition; respect for the vital female role in the family is. When we have done our work, they will gladly do theirs: bear our race&rsquo;s children.</p>

		<p>I think this article puts too much blame on women for the state of contemporary gender relations.  Men still hold most of the power in sexual relationships, as they do in society in general.  Almost all women want emotional and sexual fulfillment in a lasting marriage.  Liberals have tried to change female perceptions, but I believe that most women who claim to have a liberated worldview are trying to rationalize their lack of choices.  Many men have succumbed to the siren song of the liberals by  &mdash;  simply put  &mdash;  refusing to be manly.  They don&rsquo;t provide a strong helm for their families.  They put their own desires first, they expect their wives to work even when small children need mom at home, and, if they get tired of the present wife, they dump her for a &#8220;better&#8221; one.  <br>
As for white/black marriages, I can believe the 0.4% because so many black men refuse to marry anyone.  And I believe that almost all white women would rather have almost any white man rather than a black man who in most cases will cheat on her, spend her money, leave her with illegitimate children, physically abuse her, and ultimately abandon her.  I live in an area with a 3% black population, and yet it&rsquo;s not unusual to see a white woman with a black man or a white woman with a black child.  And I blame white men for much of this.  They want women with perfect bodies, or they refuse to be inconvenienced by children or the responsibilities that Christian white men used to take for granted.  Too many are busy doing their &#8220;own thing&#8221;.  They&rsquo;ve succumbed to the liberation of the left or to the lowest common denominator of the black, hip-hop underclass culture.</p>

		<p>The author ignores the &#8216;man-hating&rsquo; aspect of feminism popular in the West in the previous generation. Whether feminism is still anti-male is up to debate but we seem to be coasting along on the previous paradigm. This years miss USA, for example, was asked a question about contraception in the final of the competition. She answered the question in such a way as if it had never occurred to her that a male partner might have any input into this decision or even into the issue. She even appeared to be from a religions background. I believe she is an Arab Christian.  </p>

		<p>What is mentioned here is known as the &#8220;demographic transition&#8221;, It&rsquo;s the reason why world population is supposed to peak circa 2050 assuming business as usual. However, I would not be surprised to see the world &#8220;deindustrialize&#8221; significantly due to Peak Oil and Peak natural gas. So the &#8220;demographic transition&#8221; make unravel as programs such as social security implode.</p>

<p>That trend will reverse itself as soon as the country continues down the path to secession and breakup, and when we are finally split up into smaller racial enclaves, with all the white liberals forced to live among the blacks, our system of government will favor enhancing a stable population.  Not growing and not reducing, but settling on stability with an economy that allows for changing demographics in age and many other factors.</p>
<p>Continuing to grow in population encourages growth in the economy, which, in turn, produces fat, pot-bellied cigar smoking greed mongers whose God is money.  <br>

		<p>There&rsquo;s an important but overlooked reason for the decline of the white birthrate. Whites sense, even if they won&rsquo;t admit it, that the state taxes their money away and gives it to people who are disproportionally members of minorities. The whites sense that these &#8220;needs&#8221; will trump the use of their own resources for their own families. It therefore seems pointless to to plan a family, when carefully-saved resources can be taxed away, or stolen through inflation and artificially depressed interest rates.</p>

		<p>I have no respect for feminism whatsoever.  But I personally don&rsquo;t have much respect for this author either.  I have heard him talk before and he seems to like to blame everything wrong with Western Civilization on white women.  Attitudes like this only cause division and infighting.  </p>
<p>As a female, I may appear tough on this website, but that is only because I am so devoted to this cause.  In real life however, I am very feminine and submissive, probably because of my Southern upbringing.  </p>
<p>You see this especially with my attitude towards relationships. I am still in my twenties, and young men have dumped me for being &#8220;too traditional&#8221;.</p>
<p>In my office, I stick out like a sore thumb.  A large number of the women in my office are liberal and from outside the South. I am happy to make coffee for everyone.  I don&rsquo;t hold any grudges that my company is run by men.  I like being in lower, more supportive roles as a woman.  I let the men in the office open doors for me, while the other women tend to give them dirty looks.</p>
<p>In any case, I agree with the author that feminism is NOT good.  </p>

		<p>I would never bring a child into slavery.  Whites in US work in servitiude for minorities.  I have for all  my working life been taxed to pay for other groups benefits.  Why would I place a child into lifetime servitude?    US did not end slavery - it was transfered to whites through excessive taxation for REdistribution to blacks and others who learn to work the system.  Now the politics of victims is the majority. THe race to the bottom is designed to give greater rewards to poor/unemployed than working middleclass.  It no longer pays to work. The US has created a system that rewards and conditions people not to work.  I would not want a child to live in a world of demoralized poverty and sloth. Children need protection and provision.  The state has assumed the role of parent.  Where has this been done before???     V  </p>

		<p>Personally, I think that feminism is just a symptom of decline rather than a primary cause. I&rsquo;m a Spengler acolyte and I think that the western cultural organism has basically played itself out. The West has grown old and tired. We&rsquo;re losing our will to survive  &mdash;  our will to power. We&rsquo;re getting fatter. Slower. Even our fertility seems to be declining. In other words, the western organism is showing all the symptoms of old age. At this point, our civilization could vanish entirely or settle into a kind of atrophied stasis like Egypt. The rise of feminism is a symptom of this underlying decline in the same way that arthritis and hair loss are symptoms of old age. Feminism specifically is a kind of senile dementia.  </p>

		<p>Among animal species, when females need the help of a male to raise their young, monogamy is the rule, and males are not pugnacious.  There is little point in fighting over a female if you only get one.  Another will be along shortly.  <br>
 <br>
When females can raise their young alone, they choose to mate with what sociobiologists call &#8220;the fittest available male.&#8221;  With a few bizarre exceptions like the peacock, this means the best fighter.  Thus males are bred for the ability and desire to fight.<br>
 <br>
Because birds&rsquo; eggs and chicks need constant care most birds are monogamous.  A notable exception is the chicken.  One might think male eagles would fight better than male chickens, but eagles are monogamous, so the males do not fight.  Roosters are known for their belligerence.  <br>
 <br>
The fact that African agriculture requires little input from men probably contributes to the increased violent tendencies of black men.  <br>
 <br>
Aid to Families with Dependent Children continues this in the United States.  When a young black woman of the underclass has a choice between a responsible black man in a low wage job who will marry her, and a successful black criminal who will not, she will probably choose the criminal, because he will have more money to spend on her, however temporarily, and he will seem more exciting.<br>
 <br>
The high rate of black on black homicide is caused by black men fighting for sexual access to black women, like bucks fighting for does.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Why are whites failing to reproduce?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The reason is because we are victims of a specific and highly vicious pogrom to make it difficult and undesirable to reproduce.</p>
<p>Whites are the victims of race war.  Refusing to recognize that we are in a war (with millions of real casualties and real victims), effective resistance becomes difficult.  Refusing to identify the specific people waging that pogrom against us, makes it difficult to engage the enemy.</p>
<p>Nothing that is happening to whites could happen without our cooperation.  Simply waking up, admitting who is doing these specific things to us and why, and choosing not to cooperate anymore, is all that is necessary to reverse this.</p>
<p>Even among so called &#8220;race realists&#8221; that willingness is a rare thing.  Because of that, whites who think they know what the deal is with race, might as well be as blind as liberals.</p>

		<p>The last sentence of this article sums it up for me: paraphrased, the respect of the vital role of women (being mothers) in the white family must return if the white birthrate is to rise.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago when I took our oldest son to kindergarten, I also had two toddlers and newborn twins with me.  As I approached the school (no small feat) the female principal, about my age, warmly shook my hand and during some small talk, asked me what I did for work.  I was dumbfounded by her question, thinking it obvious, since I was surrounded by my work.  I have never forgotten that moment. In addition, I was called to jury duty twice during the time I had pre-school aged children, and both times was told by the judge that having young kids at home was not a legal excuse, and that I would have to find a babysitter.</p>
<p>Essentially what both of these authority figures were saying is that my work was nothing. It was actually the hardest job that I&rsquo;ve ever loved.</p>
<p>To Courtney, I had no idea you were so young, your posts are sophistocated.  Hang in there, I am confident your Southern gentleman is just around the corner.</p>

Neanderthal&rsquo;s became extinct because they were less intelligent than the Cro-Magnons who are the ancestors of Europeans and those of European ancestry.  <br>
 <br>
Whites and Orientals prefer to have small numbers of children that they can raise properly.  The future belongs to those who have the intelligence to master complex job skills in a high tech economy.

		<p>&#8220;Societies and races don&rsquo;t grow &ldquo;old&rdquo;, only individual people do.&#8221;<br>
	<br>
According to Spengler, high cultures ARE organisms with life spans like any other organism. When a culture realizes all of its potential, it basically stops growing, having matured into what Spengler called its Civilization stage. Civilizations are characterized by the appearance of mega-cities, for one thing. In Spengler&rsquo;s view, there is a huge difference between a culture and a civilization. Cultures are still growing. They&rsquo;re organic, vital and dynamic. Civilizations, on the other hand, are the final expression of a culture after it has played out all of its various possibilities. Civilizations see the emergence of money and technology  and rootless cosmopolitanism. They also see the emergence of what Spengler called Caesarism, meaning that politics would become centered on individual, charismatic personalities rather than leaders who are &#8220;culture bearers.&#8221; Compare Thomas Jefferson and Barack Obama, for example. Civilizations can last for thousands of years (Egypt, for example, or China), but they are essentially static. The emergence of China as an economic power does NOT mean that the Chinese High Culture is still alive. The primacy of money and economic power are features of civilizations, not cultures. Cultures are essentially spiritual, though not in the religious sense of the word.  The prime symbol of the Faustian or Western culture is infinite space and it shows up in everything from Gothic cathedrals to the music of Bach and the invention of perspective in oil painting. </p>
<p>I could go on about this  &mdash;  and on and on  &mdash;  but the point I was trying to make is that it looks like the Western high culture is dying and this loss of vitality is showing up not only in the increasing mongrelization of our societies but in our declining birth rates and the emergence of destructive movements like feminism and Social Marxism in general, not to mention our loss of will to defend ourselves. For instance, there has been a huge decline in male fertility (specifically a decline in the production of male germ cells, i.e., the cells that make sperm). This has been blamed on environmental factors, but I  &mdash;  being a Spenglerian mystic  &mdash;  see it as a symptom of the overall decline in western culture as it transforms into a rootless civilization. In this view, America is dead or dying, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the American civilization (in Spengler&rsquo;s sense of the word) won&rsquo;t survive for millenia in more or less the same form it has now. As the white culture-bearers of the West dwindle in numbers, most of the people living in this country will have no idea or understanding of what it once was. Hordes of blacks, Mexicans and disenfranchised whites will live out their lives in the ruins of the civilization, surrounded by the monuments of a long-vanished culture, just like Bedouins used to camp in the ruins of the Roman Empire. It&rsquo;s a grim picture, but it looks like it&rsquo;s coming true.<br>

		<p>There are many reasons to why whites do have few kids. </p>
<p>Already mentioned : Less kids gets more parental attention and supervision.</p>
<p>Female careering. Birth is however always a question that the female can decide or veto.</p>
<p>Poverty: The fear of having too few ressources, making own kids losers.</p>
<p>Other guilt complexes. Fear of the world, nukes and neighbourhood. Also there is a lowintensity misanthropy working somewhere, seeing humans and in particular whites as the most destructive and consuming specie on earth.</p>
<p>Deathrate. When we can expect kids to grow up, free from disease and accident, there is not need for more. If we have to count in loss because of lets say race war, the many will think different.</p>
<p>But what i have noticed is that it is mainly a concensus which have appeared since the 60ies that say two kids or less are the respectable number. This consensus can be broken. But there have to be sufficient grounds for changing it because the first point will not change.</p>
<p>And it could be interesting to look on possibilities for reducing the number of people born on, and to live on social security. If these only had the chance to have one child, they would be taken better care of.</p>

		<p>@ post 16</p>
<p>I think that you are confusing races with cultures/civilizations. Civilizations do die, or at least pass away into something new; broadly speaking, the West has created three cultures: Ancient (characterized by the &#8220;Greek miracle,&#8221; the discovery and subsequent glorification of man), Medieval (Christian civilization), and modern (characterized by the quest to make universal our &#8220;universal values&#8221;).  I agree post 19 that this last period seems to have just about run its course, but I am far more optimistic, for reasons I will get to later.<br>
     The grow old and die argument: La clarté parfaite, n&rsquo;est elle pas le signe de la lassitude des idées? I suppose that is one way to look at it, but I do not believe that that is the full story. That seems to, at least roughly, fit in the case of the medievals, for why did the Renaissance not come until after the 13th century synthesis, though so many of its supposed elements were in place by 1200? In the case of the ancient Greeks however, tragically, the entirety of their religious/philosophical history is a progression toward medieval Christianity (for a brief summation of this view read the introduction to Edith Hamilton&rsquo;s Mythology; the French quote is from another of her books). Our own age is the product of the Enlightenment, which was itself the result of the scientific thinking of the 17th century, Renaissance humanism, and the medieval Catholic ethos. It will not survive its collusion with the racial/ethnic/religious realities. <br>
     As for the article, I disagree with its premise that whites need to have more children. There are more whites now than there have ever been, and white fertility in the U.S. is almost at 2. The problem is our undiscriminating immigration policy. Since at least the late middle ages, white societies have almost always been below maximum fertility, and have had large numbers of single people-in stark contrast to everywhere else until recently. It is during that period that we really began to put distance between ourselves and the East materially. It may have not been much of a cause, but our low fertility certainly did not hold us back. Moreover, large populations are hardly conducive to greatness. The Roman empire, Russia, and the United States collectively have over 2,000 years of history, but all together their accomplishments are tiny in comparison to those of Athens, Florence, and England, to my mind anyway. And that is why I am optimistic. There are currently over 300 million new world whites spread out over 15 million sq. miles of land. A few million of them on a few thousand sq. miles could be enough for a white nationalist Renaissance, the start of the fourth phase in Western history. </p>

		<p>It all comes down to money.  Whites know that they have to come up with the money to raise children&hellip;and educate them.  We know that when we have a child, our life belongs to that child for eighteen years (and nine months), MINIMUM.  But we are being taxed out of existence.  We are being taxed so heavily to support the breeding habits of non-whites, that many of us lack the resources to have as many children as we&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>White women care enough about their theoretical(unborn)children to not want to bring them into a world where their future is so unsure.  They don&rsquo;t want to find themselves as single moms struggling to make ends meet, in a world where private schools and expensive neighborhoods are becoming &#8216;musts&rsquo; for whites who don&rsquo;t want to watch their offspring being bullied to death. I don&rsquo;t believe that most whites are &#8220;me, now&#8221;, &#8220;selfish&#8221; &#8220;feminist&#8221;, &#8220;irresponsible&#8221;&hellip;.. I don&rsquo;t see that in the folks around me.</p>

		<p>As to the ongoing discussion concerning the fate of white people:  As I&rsquo;ve stated before, I believe the white race will prevail because we&rsquo;re the best adapted and adaptable to changing circumstances.  First, let me state that I believe Cro-Magnons interbred with Neanderthals.  As the latter group died off from competition with the smarter group, their genes became subsumed within the newly created gene pool, which was dominated by Cro-Magnon characteristics.  Had the Cro-Magnons set up reservations for Neanderthals and given them welfare provisions, they&rsquo;d probably still be around as a group.  What would have happened to the Australoids and many Native American tribes had those of primarily European descent not done the same for them?  But, even with all the handouts, these less intelligent groups don&rsquo;t adapt well to a changing society.  Alcohol abuse among the aboriginal groups of North America and meth abuse among those of Australia is staggering.  American blacks also suffer high rates of drug addiction, and, with the white man&rsquo;s modern killing machines, are on a path to self-extermination.  For decades, their percentage of the population has barely risen and now hovers constantly at around 12%.  <br>
Wherever the white man settles, he takes over.  If there are enough white settlers, they displace native populations as the primary ethnic group.  If the Spanish and Portuguese had colonized Latin America in the same numbers as Northern Europeans did North America, Central and South America wouldn&rsquo;t be majority mestizo.  Where Spain DID colonize in greater numbers  &mdash;  Cuba  &mdash;  the majority is white, not mestizo.  And in all these countries, the lightest-skinned people have historically provided the leadership.  <br>
As to the present invasion from the south:  do we want to be like the last emperors of Rome or like the forces of Charles Martel, who stopped the Moslem barbarians and initiated their eventual return to Africa?</p>

		<p>I normally dont comment till I´ve carefully read all the previous comments but I´m going to make an exception this time (I´ll read the comments later) because the reason should be quite obvious, but its rarely mentioned perhaps because the solution sounds too socialistic at first sight.</p>
<p>The reason for low fertility is of course an excess of prosperity amongst whites - this has been said before - but the most obvious manifestation of prosperity is home ownership and the stuffing of that home with  expensive furniture, luxuries, gadgets,etc. If you dont have all this STUFF you´re considered a LOSER.</p>
<p>And then there are all the other goodies that people need to have and display in order to keep up - the cars, boats, foreign travel, etc.  Excluding a small minority of overpaid execs, doctors, specialists, lawyers etc., all these goodies cannot be paid for with one income - but 2 jobs mean 2 cars and then theres all that rushing around for shopping, cooking, taking kid to and from school, etc - its exhausting - no surprise most whites (E.Asians too) only have one or two children and those rather late in the cycle.   </p>
<p>Meanwhile the diversity, the single mothers, the illegals,  the irresponsible, the welfare-dependent, the low IQ, etc, cant compete on this level so they just go ahead, breed and collect all the state benefits. In a word this is DYSGENICS..!!  As has been pointed out by Prof Lynn, a society which doesnt encourage or actively promote a Eugenic programme is by default going to have a Dysgenic population. </p>
<p>The solution can only come about with a complete change in our priorities and way of life.  This begins to sound communistic but neednt be. The CITIES - esp THE SPRAWL - is the source of all our waste and all our problems - we need smaller, smarter spaces in which to live. ARCOLOGIES are the solution not just to the environmental mess - and please dont say there is no e/v crisis - but also to our social and political problems.  The latter of course includes race.  </p>

<p>&#8220;I think this article puts too much blame on women for the state of contemporary gender relations. &#8220;</p>
<p>I really hate to disagree with any regular female poster on Amren becuase I am sure we all want more of you all here, but I think you are wrong on most of your postions regarding the issues you took in your post.  I think that this is likely because you missed some of the aspects of the Feminist Movement that others, such as myself, did not.  You also may be of an age that has not really been affected by the attitudes perveyed by the Feminist Movement or NOW.  Living for years in the San Francisco region, I heard many a NOW speech and program discussion on radical feminist fm stations like KPFA.  If you had, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to even begin to defend feminism or carry on a complaint against the male in this context.</p>
<p>I want to give a few examples for your own and other&rsquo;s consideration.  In the 1980s, the Feminist Movement, encouraged by the lobbying and information/opinions purveyed by NOW, the common idea among women was that FATHER&rsquo;S WERE NOT NECESSARY in raising children or for a family.  I can&rsquo;t count how many times I heard women in their 20s telling me this, parroting NOW propaganda.  There was the idea that any male figure would do, however transient, and the no man is better still idea.  But smart men like me, wouldn&rsquo;t get involved with them.  They were usually pretty pathetic and low brow situations of squallor, dependence, and usury.  I tried one or two, and found immediately how far down the order of consideration I was int he scheme.  Third place, at best.  This &#8220;any man will do attitude&#8221; has evolved into the idea today, however minority it might be, that white women who have white babies are perpetuating evil.  That is at least, the final evolution of the NOW&rsquo;s hate campaign against white men.  The propaganda is still in full flight at most community college campuses, even if they are beginning to be eclipsed at some higher universities (not sure).  Our local CC here has a class on Women&rsquo;s Studies that is taught by a woman who can only be described as a &#8220;man hater.&#8221;  And she creates as many angry young women as she can manage.  I have taken a number of classes at the campus and I have found not only active anti-male sentiment there, but it is there officially.  If you or anyone would like a closer look at the machinations of NOW and the feminist movement, I recommend NOW defector Tammy Bruce as an author of several books on the subject.</p>
<p>As far as sexual dominance of men in relationships, I think that this is an opinion, and your perosnal one that may be saying more about you than anyone else.  I think that the sexual dominace of women is well known and it is used everywhere to sell products and services, to cow men into compliance, and finally to destroy the male ego.  I have had many relationships, short and long term in my life, and I have personally seen how things operate and seen how sexual power works in relationships.  Basically, men want it and women know they have what men want.  That is why prostitution is dominated by women.  It is only the amount of emotional neediness that allows men any foothold.  The sexual capital that women naturally possess is only countered by the actual physical power of men.  That is why old societies that survived the longest are the ones where men have firm control over women.  I am not saying that I like Islam&rsquo;s policies, but I can understand the causes of it.  Then there is the example of a bumper sticker I recall seeing in Northern California in the 90s;  &#8220;Girls Rule, Boys Drool.&#8221;  Women want to be sexually alluring and at the same time, taken seriously as intellectuals.  Even today, go to any news broadcast and you will see men with ties up to their throats, just as in Victorian times, sitting opposite of women, often chosen for their sexiness, in attractive fashions and often enough, with plunging necklines, and often enough cleavage.  Then, they have the nerve to say, &#8220;Eyes here,&#8221; as they stare with indignity.  There is an old medeival song called &#8220;I am Eve.&#8221;  It is a sort of confession of the misuse of female sexual power and how it caused all suffering and misfortunes since the beginning.  This is not offered as any sort of proof, but as a piece of cultural evidence.  Old cultures often know more than young ones, or ones like many in the West who have proceeded with the conceit that they are improving the lot of the human race.  In fact, just the opposite is occurring.  </p>
<p>The current material benefactors may be counted on for their loyalty to their argument.  But if we are discussing why white people are having fewer babies, you may consider mine.  I am 58, white, and have never had children.  I have a high IQ, have been considered very good looking, my blue eyes have often brought startled complements, even from men (straight ones).  Yet I did not marry until I was 47.  That is because of all the women I have known, not one I judged, loved me enough for me to trust them as mothers of my children.  I did not want to end up as many I have always known, miserable bachlors living in an apartment struggling to pay child support while they are fathered by a stranger, and my replacement.  I am a trained Guardian ad Litem.  I can tell you that women often behave very badly toward the fathers of their children - white women.  I have known countless cases of men whose wives used their children as a weapon for tormenting their former husbands.  Remaining single for so many years allowed for the experience of many married women attempting to establish an affair with me.  That actually served to destroy any confidence in marriage.  by my mid 40s, I was resigned to bachelorhood for life.  </p>
<p>But in my case, I only wanted children if I could have a reasonable chance to see them grow up in a stable enviroment with a mother who was a loyal wife.  Such an idea is almost a subject for comedy in America today.  (What am I saying Roseanne Barr made a living on that!)  </p>
<p>I was denied an SBA loan for establishing myself in my profession in the region of my upbring (Northern California) because I was a white man.  I had that told to my face.  So I struggled for years to establish myself with no help from anyone, even a good partner, even though I had many girlfriends.  What was universally common in them was that they saw me as a way to further their own aims.  They did not support me in establishing myself professionally, but wanted to use that or the stability I could provide to further their own careers.  That is how they made it out of my life everytime.  I never failed to encourage them to follow their dreams, that were sure to take them away from me.  When I was finally just beginning to make it, my office was broken into, ransacked and vandalized by a Mexican gang in 1994.  I never have recovered financially even though I kept working and even worked in Europe in my capacity.  I married a woman I met by chance, and one who wanted me because she recognized who I was deep down. We met when I was flat broke.  She was an old fashioned Southern Belle who happened to be an heiress to a small fortune.  At her age, she had not been married, how rare is that???  She must be the last of the Southern women raised and cared for until they married, however late.  She is educated in the arts and she recognized me as the nearest thing to a cultivated gentleman she had ever met.  But at our ages, it was too late for children.</p>
<p>I know many fine white men who are growing older and are single.  They were the ones who did not by chance or whatever, gain enough financially.  Or they were hurt early on and have not sought to repeat bad experiences.  But what stands out to me about them is that they are more polite and descent than most.  AA has created many poorer and single white men.  Feminism has promoted more selfishness among women than simply the material search for a mate.  </p>
<p>Anyone looking for reasons beyond this may consider the old Zero Population programs that up until the 1980s used to attempt to educate people to only have 2.3 children (or something impossible like that).  Governments in the West suddenly recognized that tax revenues would fall if such programs continued.  A large poart of the E.U.&rsquo;s aim as well our most other governments is to continue to expand the tax base with whatever color of bodies they can in order for the state to survive.  Capitalists similarly will loose money in any contraction of population.  So we are hurling down the road to the near future of an over-capacity earth, with too many problems to solve.  We appear nearer to this state every day.  So don&rsquo;t worry too much white people, we are declining really because we were smart enough to see into the future, at least some of us.  Those who think there is a future in attempting to outbreed non-whites are self-deluded.</p>

<p>Does it matter if intelligence declines? You want to be able to say &#8216;I told you so&rsquo;?</p>
<p>The story is told by the winners, and for the last 60 years or so, that&rsquo;s been liberals. We see it already, &#8216;discrimination = Equal Employment Opportunity&rsquo;. &#8216;Diversity is our strength&rsquo;. &#8216;Different standards are not double-standards&rsquo;. Heck, they are going to say &#8216;We are twice as intelligent now&rsquo;, and just lower the bar - and remove the old statues.</p>

		<p>Only trashy White women have children with Black men - these people are of no consequence in the larger scheme of things.</p>
<p>The more insidious threat are Hispanic and Asian women having kids with White men.  The amount of race mixing happening between American White men and Latinos/Asians is large and still growing.  </p>

Maybe so. But there is no future in refusing to compete with them either, and letting them populate the earth, displacing us.</p>
<p>The only answer, then, is to remove them from us (or ourselves from them) and not be engaged in a reproductive competition with them.</p>
<p>Otherwise, they will win the population race &hellip; (as they are presently doing)&hellip;particularly so when we are subsidizing their fecundity at the expense of our own.  Pure, shortsighted, madness!</p>

		<p>Whiteplight   &mdash;  - excellant post explaining what happened to you and why you didnt have children</p>
<p>Hopefully, you will read this comment and recognize that even those who didnt have children have something to pass on to other generations, namely their:WISDOM</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what is meant by  &#8220;re-Africanization&#8221; of the West.   Does that imply that the West was ever &#8220;African&#8221; to begin with?  </p>
<p>The only reason Africans are here is because they were BROUGHT here by whites who were ALREADY here and had established themselves as permanent settlers. Thus, the Africans were brought to a WHITE country. It was never African.</p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t read through all of the comments, but I thought the article well-written and found little to criticize. I, too, believe that women are the real choosers. </p>
<p>One item I didn&rsquo;t see mentioned is the possible effect of Social Security. While one commenter noted the disappearance of family farms and the need for cheap hands to work those farms (supplied now by illegal aliens), isn&rsquo;t it possible that the implied security of Social Security has lessened the need for offspring to provide for aging adults?</p>
