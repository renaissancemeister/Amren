<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Even as the Obama administration cracks down on companies that hire illegal immigrants, it is simultaneously going after employers that it says go too far in vetting job applicants to ensure they are entitled to work in the U.S.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security currently is auditing employment records of many companies suspected of hiring undocumented workers. Yet in an emerging paradox for businesses, the Justice Department and other agencies have stepped up probes of employers  &mdash;  including restaurant groups, factories and retailers  &mdash;  for allegedly violating anti-discrimination laws by demanding too many identity documents from applicants who aren&rsquo;t U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>To fend off lawsuits or enforcement actions, several companies have recently reached out-of-court settlements with the government; in some instances they paid fines.</p>
<p>&#8220;The message is: Employers beware. You need to worry just as much about asking for too many immigration documents as you do about not asking for enough,&#8221; said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration-law scholar at Cornell University.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anti-discrimination protections in the INA, meanwhile, guarantee &#8220;all individuals authorized to work in the U.S. have the right to seek employment without the added burden of special rules or document demands based on their citizenship status or national origin,&#8221; said Thomas E. Perez, assistant attorney general for civil rights. He said his unit is prioritizing enforcement of the INA provisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The monkey is on the back of employers to make the call,&#8221; said Mary Pivec, a Washington, D.C., attorney who is defending several companies with immigration-related problems. {snip}</p>
<p>By the end of 2010, the Justice Department will have boosted by 25% the total number of attorneys and investigators in its Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-related Unfair Employment Practices. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Businesses also face a proliferation of state laws designed to punish employers that hire undocumented immigrants. {snip}</p>

		<p>This only seems contradictory on its face.</p>
<p>The fact is, the rule of law has broken down in the US.  And by that I mean the rule of FEDERAL law.</p>
<p>Some states will enforce what is thinly veiled communism (unless they dissolve into anarchy like Oakland is starting to).  Most states will implement something very much like nationalism, enforcing traditionally (white) American mores and law.  The question is, will they identify this as American or go further and identify these things as specifically WHITE.</p>
<p>National funding will break down and each state will be left to fund its system on its own.  This may have happened already&hellip;.as one cannot help but notice the democrats don&rsquo;t have enough money to even pay the rest of this year&rsquo;s budget and no real way of getting more money either by taxing (which simply will be avoided by those with money) or borrowing (china has already downgraded our credit).</p>
<p>Some states will go after employers for not promoting affirmative action.  Some will go after employers for hiring illegals.  Almost no states will do both as these are mutually exclusive goals and paradigms.</p>
<p>So which type of state and systems of law will promote profit?  I can only point out that nowhere in the world, at no time in history, has marxism ever been successful.  Nationalism, however, is almost always successful, especially in the short term.</p>
<p>In November, the republicans will take over the House and Senate.  That won&rsquo;t mean much except they will quickly impeach Obama.  It will be at least a decade before our federal system works again.  This will effectively end the democrat agenda that started midway through Bush&rsquo;s second term.  A handful of states will become ghettos.  The rest will be &#8220;Tea Party&#8221; states&hellip;.that is if White Nationalism doesn&rsquo;t just manifest overtly.  There are many serious problems such a thing would quickly solve.  Problems that are causing many (white) people to suffer.  Up to now, the fact that White Nationalism could quickly solve those problems has largely been outside the public consciousness.</p>
<p>But that is changing.</p>

		<p>Miriam Jordan is an open-borders shill for the cheap labor lobby and amnesty.  I&rsquo;d say this article is saying &#8220;Let&rsquo;s not penalize employers who hire illegals.  Let&rsquo;s grant them all work permits, and then the &#8220;problem&#8221; goes away.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Obama IS anti-business.  This way, he claims to be doing &#8220;something&#8221; about the illegal alien issue while bashing businesses.</p>
<p>What a grand country we would have without Miriam, Barry, and their ilk (along with the illegals).</p>

		<p> I really can&rsquo;t stand China but they do have an excellent point in downgrading the U.S. credit rating. The U.S. has shown that the rating agency&rsquo;s are used as an unfair method of keeping our credit rating high. If one looks at the banking meltdown it was caused by rating companies Producing false high ratings for fixed return investments and causing retirees to lose their life savings. You cannot help but notice the bankers got their bailout at the expense of the public.</p>

		<p>I think employers who simply use e-Verify for all potential hires will have themselves pretty well covered; it would be hard to successfully sue someone who did this.</p>
