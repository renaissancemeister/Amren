<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Law schools have long known that first-time bar pass rates for minority are dismal compared to others, and the reasons have long eluded them. But that has not stopped schools from taking proactive steps to help students pass the bar exam.</p>
<p>For years it was the secret in the closet  &mdash;  minorities, especially African-Americans, struggled with the bar exam.</p>
<p>While more than 95 percent of whites passed the bar exam on the first try, only 61.4 percent of African-American students did so, according to a 1998 study by the Law School Admissions Council.</p>
<p>Some critics argued that poorly planned affirmative action programs were to blame. These programs, it was argued, admitted law students with lower grades or LSAT scores, and then ignored the students&rsquo; progress while in school.</p>
<p>While the jury is out on this theory, law schools have significantly improved their support for students  &mdash;  especially in regards to the bar exam.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Minority enrollment has continued to increase, and many law schools and local bar associations continue to develop programs to help students develop legal skills, bridge cultural gaps and understand the expectations of law professors.</p>
<p><b>The diversity debate</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Having diversity can encourage law students to consider and contemplate legal arguments made from perspectives other than their own,&#8221; said Sean Lew, assistant professor of Pro Bono at the Charlotte School of Law and member of the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association. &#8220;Having diversity in the classroom can also lead to an increased understanding of other races and ethnic groups, which can help law students to develop their multicultural competence when performing legal work with diverse clientele.&#8221;</p>
<p>But rampant rumors and anecdotal reports that minority bar passage rates were dismal, led some to question the wisdom of investing the time and resources into increasing minority enrollments.</p>
<p>The argument was that schools were doing a disservice to these students, since they would never pass the bar exam.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the important findings of the study [LSAC&rsquo;s National Longitudinal Bar Passage Study] was &#8220;the relatively large proportion of examinees of color, particularly black examinees, that failed the bar examination on the first attempt and did not make a second attempt.&#8221; Eventual bar passage rates were found to be considerably higher than first-time rates for all ethnic groups. Among the examinees of color who eventually passed, between 94 and 97 percent passed after one or two attempts and 99 percent passed by the third attempt, the study reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth is that minority law students graduate and pass the bar examination soon after graduation in significant numbers,&#8221; wrote former dean of Howard University School of Law Henry Ramsey, Jr., in his introduction to the LSAC study. &#8220;Therefore, the debate should be put to rest about whether law school affirmative action admission programs materially increase the number of minority lawyers.&#8221;<br>

<p>Of course the reasons have been a mystery, because it just seemed impossible that on a planet where ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL that the one group who has been the most advantaged through race based admissions and race based mentoring would consistently underperform the racially disadvantaged Whites.</p>
<p>Gee, could it be in the genes.  Impossible, because if it is, then the whole proposition of America collapses and we break up into ethnostates, which would be an admission that racism is right, natural, and healthy for the body politic to survive.</p>
<p>Gee, could all those racist segregationists have been right after all?  Who lied to us, and why?</p>

		<p>I graduated from a top-tier law school.  By a wide margin, the most unintelligent person I ever encountered in class was&hellip;wait for it&hellip;this is a big mystery&hellip;a black woman.</p>
<p>Honestly, without exaggeration, the comments and questions put forth in class made me wonder how she even made it through her undergraduate education.</p>
<p>Then, I came to my sense and realized she coasted through on the color of her skin.</p>
<p>I also graduated from an Ivy League undergraduate institution.  This place had an entire BUILDING AND ORGANIZATION dedicated to helping blacks with school. Pathetic.</p>

<p>61.4 % of how many?  If they&rsquo;re talking about 61.4% of about a hundred blacks, I&rsquo;ll conceded there MIGHT be a small segment that would pass first time out, but I&rsquo;m more inclined to believe every minority statistic they come up with is distorted to favor blacks and other non-whites some way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to find a sample bar exam just to see how difficult the questions might be.  I&rsquo;m betting the test isn&rsquo;t really that difficult and that taking it several times a person with a 100 I.Q&hellip;.maybe even less&hellip;. could pass it, if he/she poured over sample questions dozens of times.</p>

=====================</p>
<p>Um it is not an IQ test like the LSAT, you have to actually know the relevant law of the state.  You could conceivably pass it in some of the easier states with rigorous study and prep courses but you have to actually have to learn the law. <br>

<p>Yes, ignore ALL empirical evidence showing non-White, AA students admitted with lower LSAT scores pass the bar at a lower rate than Whites admitted with higher scores and grades.</p>
<p>Why would anyone believe data over a theory?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Hispanics average a score [on LSAT] that would fall only at the 24th percentile of the non-Hispanic white distribution;  the black average falls at the 12th percentile among Whites&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&rsquo;The truth is that minority law students graduate and pass the bar examination soon after graduation in significant numbers,&rsquo; wrote former dean of Howard University School of Law Henry Ramsey, Jr&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not according to a UCLA study:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Data gathered by Richard Sanders of the UCLA Law School shows that 53% of the black students who enter law school fail to qualify to become lawyers, versus 24% of White students. About 40 percent of black law school graduates never pass the bar exam, compared to 15 percent of Whites&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Yeah, right. And how exactly can you identify these other &#8216;perspectives&rsquo; without resorting to ethnic stereotyping? Is Lew actually saying that Black people perceive things differently to White people? And if I find some of these &#8216;perspectives&rsquo; undesirable can I use this as a basis to reject an ethnic group, say, for employment?</p>

<p>Any Asian, Amer-Indian, or member of any other racial or ethnic group simply notes &#8220;Blacks not too smart.&#8221;  No further commentary is necessary, no endless searching for &#8220;root causes,&#8221; the hidden effects of racism, or the centuries-old residual effects of slavery.</p>

<p>Yes, I understand that there has to be an understanding of the law, and there would likely be other situational questions on the test to answer also, but I assume that a process of repetitively answering various questions, THAT INCLUDE questions of state law, would serve to hammer the information into black minds.  </p>
<p>Black memory is about the only thing they have that could be considered average.  Their difficulty in passing ANY test would be in problem solving, where logic and reasoning is required.  The fewer these kinds of questions, and the more questions concerning memory, my repetitive process suggestion would suffice to get a black a passing grade.</p>
<p>And, regarding the test being different from an I.Q. test, I never suggested or implied that it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>My entire point concerning I.Q. is that there has to be some kind of method blacks are using to pass the law exams in various states, because their average college I.Q.&rsquo;s are low.  They have AA in entry, grading and certification.  I&rsquo;m betting there is some kind of devious method they&rsquo;re using to pass the bar exams.  My suggested that the tests might be passed if there were a lot of questions on them regarding information that could be &#8220;tutored&#8221; with a repetitive process over and over again, was just a suggestion as a possible reason why many of them are able to get their license.</p>
<p>At this point, I would have to check out a sample test to see just what it is all about.  After listening to most of these black talking heads on T.V. who have law degrees, and talking in person to a few in actual experience, and reading their posts and opinions, I&rsquo;m appalled that all but a wee few come across as being unable to pass anything but a high school GED test, let alone a bar exam.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in finding out more about how they&rsquo;re passing bar exams, even though their percentage is low.  There&rsquo;s got to be some chicanery going on somewhere or the tests are not difficult to pass even by anyone with only about a 100 I.Q.<br>

		<p>Umm.  So let me see if I can summarize:  blacks are less intelligent than whites, blacks fail the bar exams far more often, blacks aren&rsquo;t as &#8220;prepared&#8221; for law school (meaning they are less competent than whites) and more must be done to push AA students through.  And why?  Because it&rsquo;s important that they bring to the court room that special insight&hellip;..meaning so they can defend and prosecute based NOT on law, but on color.  Nullify prosecutions of blacks, and impose unreasonable or unlawful prosecution against whites.  And we wonder why this country and it&rsquo;s legal system is becoming irrelevant and going down the drain?</p>

		<p>When I took the bar exam many years ago, it was very challenging, even for bright people who studied hard for it. I think the pass rate was around 65% overall. Something must have changed if the pass rate is so high now.</p>
<p>Even in the 70&rsquo;s there was a big uproar over the dismal pass rate of black law graduates. I heard some silly theory that somehow the bar exam graders could guess race by the writing style and intentionally flunked the blacks. This was actually stated with a straight face by a &#8220;progressive&#8221; white law student, wearing a black armband to show solidarity! Test takers were ID&rsquo;d by number only, so they couldn&rsquo;t see TaNeesha&rsquo;s name. </p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the low LSAT scores of the affirmative action admittees, of course. It would be interesting to compare bar exam pass rates of black and white law students with equally low LSAT scores (if one could find any whites who got into law school with such low scores). <br>

		<p>The time has come to stop the charade; that is, we are all mentally equal.  It would behoove the black race to get training in something where they can excel and able to make a good living.  They all can&rsquo;t be in the NBA but there are the trades and there is an excellent future in electrical work, plumbing, etc.  Why not face reality and get into something where you can earn a good living wearing overalls.  That is the way the early Europeans started and look where they are today - that is what I call real, honest progress.</p>

		<p>There is NO WAY 61% is the correct number.  Unless we are talking about a state with a very easy Bar, 61% sounds way too high to me.</p>
<p>BTW, speaking as someone who has passed the Bar in three states,  I can tell all of you that is it a very, very difficult test.  You would not believe the amount of stuff you have to know.  Also, generally when people fail, they do not flunk it by that much.  In fact, I knew someone who got 1438 points out of 2000 on the CA bar.  She need 1440 to pass.  </p>
<p>The blacks who do sit for the bar are NOT stupid.  They are probably relatively bright.  Law school grades you anonymously.  You don&rsquo;t get pushed through because of your color.  This would explain to why the flunk-out rate of blacks is extremely high in the first year. </p>
<p>AA for law school is the worst possible thing for blacks.  They wind up completely mismatched for the school.  For example, a black might get into Harvard who would otherwise have gotten into a second-tier school.  Law school grades on a curve.  Thus, they may have actually done well, or at least passed at the second tier school, but because they were put into Harvard, they flunk.  (I probably would have flunked out of Harvard too).  </p>
<p>The problem is that if you flunk out after first year you have $50k in debt and nothing to show for it.  AA truly only is a major disadvantage for blacks when it comes to law school.  Because you are graded anonymously, there is no way for you to pass just because you are black (something I am sure many people counted on in the past). </p>

<p>Gee, how about they&rsquo;re not that bright and they shouldn&rsquo;t have been admitted to law school in the first place?  Law school admission is highly competitive and it&rsquo;s truly sad that for every unqualified minority admitted a qualified white person is turned away.  The message:  racial discrimination is okay as long as whites are the victims.</p>

<p>Not being facetious here, I really am curious at how you can anonymously grade someone.  Like you posted here, &#8220;anonymous.&#8221;  We don&rsquo;t know who you are.  How can you grade someone when you don&rsquo;t even know who they are?  How can you make sure the proper grades are applied to the proper person, when the grading system is anonymous?</p>
<p>Is participation in classroom discussions a portion of the grade?  How is this anonymously graded?</p>
<p>Is it done by number?  Are law schools so big that the multiculturalist do-gooder professors don&rsquo;t get to know which number correpsonds to a minority student?  </p>
<p>I realize that this is bordering on the conspiracy-theory level, but my own experience shows me it&rsquo;s not too far-fetched to believe the race crusaders don&rsquo;t implement their own little classroom-sized affirmative action programs, regardless of official policy.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&rsquo;m no law school graduate, so I have to trust in your experiences and those of others.  I just don&rsquo;t put much faith in a grading system being anonymous solely because the race crusaders say it is so.</p>

		<p>@20, 18 here:</p>
<p>This is how it works:  you are given a number in law school  You write your number on your exams.  Thus all the prof sees when they grade your test is your number.  The prof then submits the grade to the registrar who assigns it to your real name.  You can get &#8220;some&#8221; participation points in some classes.  But most profs don&rsquo;t give any (everyone has to participate), and if you do get participation points, it is so slight that it really would not affect your grade.  From my experience, it was more of an empty promise to get you to raise your hand.  </p>
<p>In order to get these points, the prof submits something with your name to the registrar and then they cross-reference it with your number.  </p>
<p>Law school takes this system of blind grading VERY seriously.  You are not allowed at all to put anything on an exam that might give away your identity.  Professors are never in the room when the exam is given, it is always proctored.  </p>
<p>The only class where this does not happen is an upper division writing class.  The nature of the class makes it impossible to be anonymous on your paper.  </p>
<p>I liked law school because every grade you got was earned completely on the merits.  You could score a higher grade than that guy the professor just LOVED and slobbered all over.  You also could never, ever, EVER go beg the prof to raise your grade.  Your grade was your grade, period.  </p>
<p>And, yes, most of the blacks who start first year are not there the second.  The saddest part was that I do believe some of them probably could have passed at a less challenging law school.   </p>

		<p>In Louisiana, about 5 years ago there was a large group of Black law school graduates that could not pass the Bar Exam after numerous tries, and they collectively sued the State of Louisiana and the Bar Association for &#8220;discrimination&#8221; in the testing methods, with their only proof being their continued, repeated failures to pass, and the defendants &#8220;settled&#8221; with them by making them all lawyers and stipulating that they had all &#8220;passed&#8221;.</p>
<p>About a dozen of the 35 plaintiffs became elected judges, almost all in Black-majority New Orleans.</p>

		<p>Anonyomous grading is sometimes honest, other times corrupt.  Some professors regularly date &#8220;good looking&#8221; students, who somehow happen to get the highest grades in the class. Other professors are like the Soup Nazi. It just depends upon the school and the &#8220;tolerence&#8221; for foolishness that the schol leadership has at the time.</p>
<p>Some schools actually morn murdered students. Many other schools gloss over the murder and the life of the productive white student, but then go into histrionics, forums, dialogue sessions, counseling, self-examination when a student witness describes the murderer as being &#8220;Black&#8221; &hellip;&hellip; I know, I lived through such a school.</p>

		<p>Well, in my own personal observations, the anonymous grading at my law school was very above-board.  There was way too much at stake for most people to try and get around it.  If you were caught cheating, you were instantly expelled.  If the prof was caught altering your grade because you were not really &#8220;anonymous&#8221; to him, he would probably get fired.  </p>
<p>Really, the only shady part of law school that is not merit-based is the admission process.  That is the only time you&rsquo;ll catch a break because of your ethnicity.  Otherwise, you&rsquo;re graded on your merit.  Period.  </p>
<p>Case-in-point: I once had a professor for a very difficult class who really took to me.  She asked me to help her with stuff and she thought my comments in class were brilliant.  When it came time for the final, I got behind in some of my studying and just wound up not studying for her test like I should have.  (totally my fault - I was not budgeting my time).</p>
<p>She gave me a C+.  It absolutely did not matter that I was her &#8220;pet.&#8221;  My exam sucked and that was that.  </p>
<p>Trust me on this.  I would guess that half of all blacks admitted to law school flunk out within the first year.  You really, truly cannot get around having to study hard and write well.  There is no room to &#8220;negotiate&#8221; up to a passing grade.  You also cannot write a paper about what it&rsquo;s like to be black or hispanic or whatever and automatically get an A because you wrote about how hard it is to be ethnic.  You actually have to write a paper on a real, ACADEMIC topic.  (crazy, I know)  </p>

		<p>WR #7 &#8220;who would hire these AA graduates&#8221;</p>
<p>Everyone. You must remember the firms they would be hired onto are also dumbed down, the juries are (if it&rsquo;s even possible) dumbed down, and the judges, too, are dumbed down and/or bought off. In addition, all legal rulings nowadays are given either through emotional opinion OR &#8216;give me the money.&rsquo; No one even needs to know the laws.</p>
