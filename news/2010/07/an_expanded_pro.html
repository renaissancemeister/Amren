<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>    THE REDS AND THE BLUES: IT&rsquo;S TIME FOR A DIVORCE</p>
<p>    By &#8220;Jeffersonian&#8221;</p>
<p>    1) The problem facing us</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>    2) The solution: partition the United States into two countries</p>
<p>If the United States were to be divided into two independent countries  &mdash;  one consisting of the counties that voted for Bush in 2000 and the other consisting of the counties that voted for Gore  &mdash;  then most of the Bush voters would wind up in the &#8220;Red country&#8221; and most of the Gore voters will wind up in the &#8220;Blue country.&#8221;</p>
<p>One might question whether such a radical procedure is necessary. Could we not achieve our goals merely by convincing more people of the virtues of our policies and then winning some elections? No, such a plan might sound good in theory, but it is bound to fail in the long run because of demographic factors.</p>
<p>The central problem is that the ranks of the Blues are constantly being augmented by the mass immigration of non-Europeans. California and Illinois used to be swing states; but, as a result of immigration, Illinois is now a Blue state and California is a Democratic stronghold. Florida and Texas will follow within thirty years unless the flood of immigrants is halted. Even if immigration is halted, an amnesty for the illegal immigrants already here (a law strongly supported by the Democratic Party, and by many Republican leaders as well) will create an electorate in which the Republicans have little chance of winning. Even without amnesty, the children of today&rsquo;s illegal aliens will become voting citizens within fifteen or twenty years, with almost the same effect.</p>
<p>Indeed, even in the best-case scenario, in which we obtain a moratorium on immigration, and in addition manage to deport the majority of the illegal immigrants, differential birth rates will still be fatal to us within a few decades. The &#8220;Anglo&#8221; population (the majority of which are Reds) is not having enough children to reproduce itself, whereas the Hispanic population (most of whom are Blues) has a much higher birthrate and its numbers are increasing rapidly.</p>
<p>Actually, the best-case scenario seems improbable. It is unlikely that we will soon adopt a moratorium on immigration. Nor does it seem likely that most of the illegal immigrants here today will be deported: the chances are that most of them will eventually be amnestied. In the course of the next few decades, the political position of the Reds will become hopeless. If we wish our descendants to live in a free country we must secede before that occurs.</p>

		<p>Secede? How so? Are we to gerrymander the entire country? (Okay, I just read the original article - I think it sounds like a disaster in the making.) Besides, what good would it be if you still have mixed races within both new nations - It would still mean almost certain extinction for White people over time.  What about those decendants of the new &#8220;Red&#8221; nation who become liberal &#8220;Blue&#8221; types - are we to banish them to the Blue nation, or have it in the constitution that expression of such ideas are to be against the law?  Otherwise, 200 Million people claiming only 600,000 square miles (or ~1/6 of the land mass), while the other 100 million people claim 2.5 million square miles? Figure those odds - The Blue Nation will definitely want to ensure its own food supply. I understand the desire for separation, but believe for such an action to be successful, it must firstly be based on race.  Let the liberal Whites go with the multiculturalists - movement of population would be a necessity, and it would mostly be &#8220;Red&#8221; types moving into a smaller nation. Far too many issues with this set up&hellip;</p>

		<p>The only good thing about secessionist proposals is that it will get millions of Native Born White Americans to come to grips with the very real possibility that they will be living on a significantly reduced living space. This might very well be so traumatizing that they will finally come to their senses and reclaim Native Born White American territory lost to China,India,Pakistan,Iran and Mexcio. After all secession is about allowing China to extend its genetic borders deep into America&hellip;.right up to the greatly reduced territory of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>If the Native Born White American population starts to increase in size in  its greatly reduced living space,it will begin to feel very crowded. The amenities-open space spectacular state and national parks- will all be lost and paved over. Expect severe water shortages.</p>
<p>If partition does happen, the Blue States-largely socially conservative Hispanics,Asians,Africans and Muslims will have no use and tolerance for the very liberal White Liberal Democrats&hellip;Liberalism contains the seeds of its own destruction. As a consequence, the US will be racially partioned into two racially distinct regions&hellip;regions that will be competing for the scarce resources-what&rsquo;s left of them-in the former America. It is as blueprint for you know what. Secessioist don&rsquo;t think about these things at all. They are in a fanatasy world.</p>

		<p>The idea is sound but partitioning the country based on Bush voters and Gore voters is ridiculous.  I consider myself a right winger but I don&rsquo;t like Bush and wouldn&rsquo;t want to live around people who voted for him.  That is a sentiment shared by the real right in this country.  I take issue with other things in this article.  It&rsquo;s the White people in the blue states that aren&rsquo;t reproducing themselves, not in the red ones.  Amnesty is dead on arrival even with a majority Democrat Congress and the mood among the population is to restrict immigration not continue it and deport the children of illegal aliens. If you look at a red/blue state map by county you&rsquo;ll see the vast majority of the country is red with blue dots representing metropolitan areas. Only three states are solidly blue, Massachusetts, Vermont and Connecticut.  Even California is only blue around some of the coastal areas.  We are far from defeated.  Eighty percent of US citizens are White and it only requires deportation of illegals, green card holders and asylum seekers to restore our demographics. </p>

		<p>The basic problem with all these &#8220;partition&#8221; schemes is that it assumes racial categories and sociopolitical outlook can be neatly divided along geographical lines.  The state of Pennsylvania, to use one example, is a vast rural White hinterland, debased on its southwest corner by Pittsburgh and its southeast corner by Philadelphia.  Those black/liberal fortresses make Pennsylvania look like a liberal state if the only criteria to be applied are the federal election returns.</p>
<p>The country as a whole is the same way, with strongholds of level-headed Whites interspersed with growing numbers of criminals of Color.  It ain&rsquo;t 1860 any more, folks.  Amerika&rsquo;s division isn&rsquo;t along geographical boundaries this time.<br>

		<p>This is absurd.  How can you have a country without any cities?  Every city in the USSA is firmly under the control of Marxists.  Can anyone name an exception?</p>
<p>The correct way to divide the country is to wall off the portions of our cities where the MLK Blvd is, and to throw all the Marxist white liberals into it to organize their socialist utopia.  Let them experience first hand the joys of the Diversity they have worshipped for so long.</p>

<p>I have been saying this for years. No one pays attention, especially the REDS! In fact they have jumped on the multicult bandwagon and want to run a BLACK man (someone named &#8220;Cain&#8221; in 2012.. They are so afraid of talking about race and just say, we are all the same and the God loves everybody garbage that I have left the Republicans. I am going to go Constitution Party.  They may not have a clue either about racial issues, but at least they are NOT the Dems or the Repubs who have proven their disloyality to Whites!</p>

<p>Other nations have divided peacefully: USSR, Norway-Sweden, the Uruguays.  It can be done but the neo-Marxist will start a war to prevent it.  Great things are not achieved without the shedding of blood, but we are shedding blood now.  It would be worth ending the Federal Government just to get prayer back into the schools.  DO IT.</p>

		<p>Do not give up on a geographic separation&hellip;.in fact, it is unavoidable, simply because people require land (which they already occupy), even if they cannot share a single government.</p>
<p>I expect the lower-48 to break up into three parts&hellip;.regionalism is still alive and well. The South may be the region with the strongest identification, but the other two parts are not far behind.</p>
<p>The New South is Texas and Oklahoma, plus all states east to the Atlantic. Missouri, Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland should leave it to their own voters to decide if they want to be part of the New South or not.</p>
<p>The Mississippi River can (and has) divided the rest of the lower-48 into EAST and WEST.</p>
<p>We can accomplish this peacefully by a constitutional amendment.<br>

		<p>THERE IS A WAY.</p>
<p>Turn the Federal Government against itself.  Without money the Federal Government cannot exist.  If China stopped loaning money, the Federal System would come to an end along with the nation.  We would then be two nations without firing a shot.</p>
<p>The TEA must pledge that when in power, the USA will not pay off its debt to China.  We will only pay debt up to some date like 1990 but nothing else.  We would declare to China that they should have known that we could never pay off their loans and must accept responsibility for the default.  After WW1 and WW2 European nations defaulted on the loans we gave and never repaid.  The Chinese governments never repaid the loans we gave them after WW2.  Maybe we could sell that California Blue Country to China in exchange for what we own China after we gain power.  See, it can be done.</p>

If Alaska was not part of the USA, it would be the third richest nation on earth with all of its oil, natural resource, timber, oil, and potential hydro power.  If Texas were not part of the USA it would be the second richest nation on earth.  New York, Illinois, and Texas have a larger GDP than the EU (at least when Bush was President).  If the USA was partitioned, the Blue part would soon look like North Korea or East Germany.  It can be done, lets start to plan doing it.  When our minds are made up nothing has ever stopped us.</p>

		<p>Well, I can put their minds at ease in the above story.</p>
<p>Voluntarily splitting up into Reds and Blues won&rsquo;t be necessary, because a split is going to be forced on us as a result of societal collapse during the Greatest Depression ever, which is in progress right now.</p>
<p>As we get toward the end of this year, and as we progress into next year, if it isn&rsquo;t obvious to intelligent people that no matter what the feds say or try we are headed downward into societal breakup, then they have to be living in a cave.  </p>
<p>Even Bernanke is saying that he sees an uncertain financial future for us.  And, one of the country&rsquo;s biggest airhead liberals, Paul Krugman, said a couple of weeks ago that we are NOW&hellip;not headed toward&hellip;BUT NOW at the beginning of a depression.  This is the same NYT radical who refused to admit we were in a recession until it was impossible to deny it any longer.</p>
<p>And, as the country continues to deteriorate economically and racially, the threat of impeachment will be echoed more and more.</p>
<p>Just one cross border terrorist attack could cause proceedings to begin immediately.  Otherwise, it will continue to build as it has been now for several months.</p>
<p>The man is on a par with every black incompetent, running every government in America and Africa.</p>

		<p>It seems that the question is rapidly no longer becoming &#8220;whether&#8221;, but &#8220;when&#8221;, and especially &#8220;how&#8221;, the division of the Nation Formerly Known as the United States  will be effected.  How do you divide two ideologies, how do you divide the givers and takers, how do you assign each racial group its own space, in the quest to un-diversify?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll be inventive, and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll be unfair at times, but this may be the one thing that we can work together to create:  our balkanized future.  Then, let the geopolitical games begin.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t see this as something White liberals would want.  Why would anyone assume that White liberals would want to see wave after wave of nonwhite immigration in their areas until they are outnumbered and out of power?  New England is a bastion of liberalism but it&rsquo;s lilly White.  Same with Minnesota, Wisconsin, Oregon and to a lesser extent Washington.  Are these people really going to want to merge with New Jersey, New York City and coastal California and share the tax burden with coddling black and brown people they&rsquo;ve been keeping their distance from?  Liberals are 20 percent of the population so any partition would put them at a disadvantage of being outnumbered among their minorities.</p>

		<p>I agree. The left and the right, the blue and the red, have such completely different personal and world views that the two are incompatible and the US is destined to fail. I would like to see a separation (I would likely have to move and find a new job as I live in NY which is among the bluest of the blue).</p>
<p>I also agree with Mark D who wrote in the comment section:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;If we divide the United States into two countries, won&rsquo;t the liberals and coloreds be attracted to the new &#8220;Red&#8221; country? Concentrating so many Democratic voters in the new &#8220;Blue&#8221; country will surely lead to economic failure, and the residents of the new Blue country will surely be attracted to the economic success of the prosperous Red country.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>A liberal, non-racist, multicultural &#8220;Utopia&#8221; will collapse under it&rsquo;s own liberal policies in a self-consuming orgy to please everyone. It wouldn&rsquo;t be long before their failure would be self-evident and the exodus would begin. They will also NOT accept their failure as of the own making. We will be seen has having taken the property with us when we left (as if prosperity is a finite state of affairs).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a reason not to try but liberals and minorities KNOW that can&rsquo;t live without whites who fuel the engine of the economy. It&rsquo;s the same reason that although blacks blame whites for all their problems, blacks attach themselves to whites. If they really believed we were their problem, they would run from us not to us.<br>
 <br>
I support the goal. Implementing it, maintaining it, protecting and preserving it is the challenge.</p>

		<p>All right, I&rsquo;m a guy who loves maps and have poured over them for years, fascinated at how people divide the lands of the earth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a 20 year expert on history, both world and U.S.  Here are the issues and problems any partition would bring.</p>
<p>#1  The Fed would never allow it and would use Lincoln-era arguments to prevent it by force.  With the Fed firmly under the control of non-whites and white liberals, they would see their gravy train diminished and would never stand for it.</p>
<p>#2  As posters have pointed out, the divisions in the white community are merely political.  It&rsquo;s much easier for nations to break apart if there are language differences, religion or racial differences, but asking whites to split the nation over our retarded political parties is asking too much.  Those who fantasize about &#8216;the South will rise again&rsquo; need to look out their windows and realize there are more blacks and latinos in the South now than whites.  How would you make a &#8216;white&rsquo; south again?</p>
<p>#3  What about all the people who get social security, medicare, etc.  The dissolution of the Fed would necessarily stop all the programs, no matter how you try to prevent it.  How will the debt of the Fed be divided?  It is simplistic to say that any new nation would just repudiate it.  It cannot be done.</p>
<p>#4  Yes, many states are full of conservative whites with liberal cities.  Would you have gerrymandered territories?  How would you prevent or monitor the movements of whites from one new nation to the other?  How about more illegal mexicans?  Would the division of mixed states become an Indian partition thing where huge populations flee and fight each other along the way?</p>
<p>#5  Who would get the nukes?  How would you divide the army?  Would the military even go along with this or seize control and make a dictatorship, like has happened in so many other times and places?  What about all the black and latino soldiers?  Do you think they will go along with your plans? </p>
<p>#6  Would China become the protector of San Francisco and have a beachhead?  Who would get the nation&rsquo;s historical relics?  Would you want crackpot christian fundamentalists making some god awful constitution mandating their sect as the religion of the land?</p>
<p>#7  Minorities are everywhere.  Would you force them to move to the &#8216;Blue&rsquo; nation?  How would you do that?  But if your idea is to preserve a white nation, then you would have to do it, and since you really can&rsquo;t all you&rsquo;ve done is make two nations that will become third world nations.</p>
<p>#8  What if one of the new nations makes alliances with those you don&rsquo;t like?  What if your own children &#8216;go blue?&rsquo;  Will you expel them, strip them of their &#8216;red&rsquo; citizenship?</p>
<p>The list goes on and on.  Partition is a bad idea for everyone.  The best that can be done is what some have suggested.  Halt immigration, deport all illegals, reinterpret the 14th (birth) amendment and make it RETROACTIVE to 20 years, cancel all green cards, work visas, student visas, etc, put employers of illegal immigrants in JAIL, and build a border barrier that works.</p>
<p>These are things that are within reach and can be striven for without bringing a new dark age to this continent.</p>

		<p>Just be patient, it will probalbly happen. The division may be a bit different then Jefferson predicts. Of course, China will take a big hunk. Perhaps an India-Islamic-Asian coalition will divide the rest. The area in question will include much more than the U.S., and include most of the western hemisphere. </p>

		<p>Breakup of the USA is a distinct possibility, and the ONLY one wherein Anglo culture and quality of life will ever regain  it&rsquo;s footing.<br>
Some poster here stated the USA was 80% white.<br>
Well, I&rsquo;ll have some of what he&rsquo;s smoking!<br>
Has this guy been in his basement for forty years?<br>
We&rsquo;re south of 70 %, and to anyone who has the slightest grasp of population growth, the demographic deed is already done. There are enough Mestizos and other third worlders in the USA today (easily 40 million, with an astronomically high birthrate), to swamp out whites forever.</p>
<p>DID YOU KNOW THAT AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AGE WHITES ARE ALREADY A MINORITY?<br>
Come on,wake up!. The Census bureau tells us that the dark day of white minority will come around 2050. Simple math shows it&rsquo;s closer to 2020. <br>
Let&rsquo;s not forget; at this very instant, thousands of Mestizos are trapsing across our border. Over one million illegally every year&hellip;then the one to two million third worlders a year who get in via &#8220;legal&#8221; means. <br>
Now, no one wants a wrenching change, but, um, isn&rsquo;t the current USA a horrific trainwreck? What exactly are you all waiting for?<br>
Start looking at this pragmatically, deliberately, and aim to get it done legally and peacefully. There are definite needs for the relocation of millions, but by choice. When a state of a particular stripe forms, it will attract those of that stripe, and so it will grow. It has happened many times before across the world.</p>
<p>The USA would break up into several nations, with at least one white conservative nation. My guess for success? A Liberal nation, just like today&rsquo;s. Think upper east coast and maybe to minnesota. A conservative all white union. Think Northern Mountain states, with a corridor to the Pacific, and a big chunk of the heartland. A mestizo state (California-or maybe the southern part only), and a black state ( Louisiana).<br>
It&rsquo;s either that, or centuries of increasing mysery for everybody.<br>
Take lawful secession seriously.<br>
It&rsquo;s the only hope for historical America to survive. Blue/red state stuff is of course a joke.<br>
It&rsquo;s by race, that&rsquo;s the only way.  <br>
Of course the marxists will keep their &#8220;utopia,&#8221; which will fall into entropy. The black state will implode immediately, as do all black states. The Mestizo state will look like Mexico (i.e: will flounder in poverty and violence, but will probably invade the black state, because it&rsquo;s the only state they could take).<br>
The white nation or nations would throw up a DMZ, and keep everybody out, and prosper until a white scallawag and his fifth column begin to sell it out, and so it will all begin again.<br>
But the present USA will not stand. I wish it weren&rsquo;t true, but I doubt it can survive. I miss my country. I don&rsquo;t want a Kosovo. Peaceful secession along racial lines will keep it from happening. </p>

		<p>Some here have stated thet the Marxists control all the cities, and will not allow any secession.<br>
That&rsquo;s a BIG laugh. The good thing about the Marxists, is they are jellyfish. They cannot engage in combat, and the fighting men of the US military (about 90% white) will not aid the Marxists. The Military will stand down. Some might say all those troops will be on a fool&rsquo;s errand in some far flung hellhole, and that some shadow force will appear to machine-gun down us whites. Nope. White military minded men will not slaughter whites, and nobody else (of any other race) would dare take us on. In fact, You&rsquo;ll find that a lot of liberals quickly cleave to our sides for protection.<br>
There will be no need for violence, and it can be done without a shot. A paper revolution. Do you imagine the Democratic party coming to stop the breakup? The effete Neocons? Ha!<br>
The worst thing they can do is parachute Nancy Pelosi naked on top of us (that IS ugly).<br>
Seriously, pot smoking berkenstock-wearing lefties will retreat to momma&rsquo;s basement when Americans redraw the lines. They are scared of their shadows, and you know that.<br>
No, there are no serious barriers, if we want it. And in the end, most everybody would like the change, because even if they want to gad about all day in a pink ballet outfit, waving a flag of Che, singing about diversity, they&rsquo;ll have a place to go. <br>
And Blacks can finally have their piece of America. And the Mestizos can have the chunk Uncle sucker and us dumb whites actually gave them: California, let&rsquo;s say, up to Los Angeles.<br>
Conservative whites can have their own place. <br>

		<p>Go to VFR and read the whole article.  The idea appears a lot more feasible when the plan is examined in detail!  <br>
I think it&rsquo;s more likely that the nation will just evolve into some sort of confederation, where different regions will have much more control over their own populations and laws, without the overreaching control of a federal government.  Right now, states have begun defying federal laws (weed, illegals, etc.),and D.C. isn&rsquo;t doing much about it but carping and making weak gestures.  Large U.S. regions already have their own long-established characteristics and could easily reform into entities in a confederation.  I don&rsquo;t know of any existing state that would be left in an island.  Some states, like CA and OH, might split into north and south areas.  Ohio south of Dayton, for example, would cheerfully join Southern states.  WV is culturally Southern except in the eastern panhandle.  If cities with majority black populations didn&rsquo;t like the new rules  &mdash;  say, for example a law allowing racial discrimination in private enterprise  &mdash;  they could pass municipal ordinances mandating non-discrimination inside the city.  <br>
The founding fathers meant the states to have a lot of autonomy.  Some of the framers were forced into this position in order to get all states to agree, but that&rsquo;s what we got.  It&rsquo;s just that it has eroded so much over the years.</p>

Don&rsquo;t worry about the ideological differences, if they are forced to mix with their beloved minorites they will come running South as fast as they can.</p>
<p>And as an aside, dividing between red and blue, Bush and Gore is practical. It does not mean the reds liked Bush, just that they had no one else to vote for. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see a large difference between Gore and Bush. They both support amnesty and affirmative action. Bush spoke against affirmative action to appease us, but he did nothing to fight the racist policy. McCain is of course a clone as well. These men weren&rsquo;t radical or hateful, but spineless. These worthless men cared mostly about  appeasement and retaining power. </p>
<p>Gore and Bush voters were different than the anti-white racists who voted for &#8220;Robert Mugabe&#8221; Obama. Obama is much worse than the spineless unics we were forced to choose from in the past. Obama is not spineless. He brazenly hates us and has declared war on us. </p>

		<p>This &#8220;solution&#8221; does NOT address the crux of the problem for the white Christian males: forced integration.   As long as enough white males are willing to allow their group to be forcibly integrated, the other races are going to come&hellip;in human waves they&rsquo;re going to come. The 1964 Civil Rights Act changed everything. White Christian males need to make sure, that is once this system does collapse, they will NEVER submit to forced integration again. </p>
<p>I think what we&rsquo;ve learned over the last 45 years, since compulsory integration was created (it never existed in human history)is the following:<br>
* No male group has a god-given right to get integration rights into another male group. It was given as an experiment for the black man, and it failed miserably.</p>
<p>* White males are NOT the source of freedom, equality and manhood for the black man (only he seems to believe these things are obtainable not among his own people but among among the white race). White males cannot forever be his provider.</p>
<p>*Non-white males, with the exception of a few Asian groups, will not produce enough occupations within their own male groups, therefore, they will show up in the white communities seeking to sell their labor (the failure of non-white males to generate occupations for their group members, IMO, appears to be cultural, not based on intelligence). If non-white males are allowed into white male societies, this, as we have clearly seen, will produce (1) endless dependency for the non-white group (s) on their white male benefactors; (2) more non-white males will come, seeking what the other received - JOBs.  These jobs will come at the expense of the white males </p>
<p>If white Christian males don&rsquo;t seek to protect their societies from encroachment from non-white male groups, they will resemble that character in Greek mythology, Sisyphus, who was condemned for eternity to push a stone up a hill only to see it roll back down.  White Christian males will be condemned to build societies only to watch them crumble -from the saturation of non-white males. <br>

		<p> maybe they will finally come to their senses and reclaim Native Born White American territory lost to China,India,Pakistan,Iran and Mexcio. After all, secession is about allowing China to extend its genetic borders deep into America. <br>
  &mdash;  Jupiter</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s well put:  extending their genetic borders deep into North America says it exactly.  We must also bear in mind,  the way Canada is going,  that we will have on our north an Asiatic/third-worldish country which has already fallen to the Asiatic hordes. They will be looking to extend themselves further and link up with their countrymen here. </p>
<p>There are already huge concentrations of various Asian nationalities  perched just a few miles from the US border.  Not a good scenario! If the USA had a whit of sense we would give the Canadian government an ultimatum that we do not see this development so close to our border as a friendly one and we will not tolerate its continuation. If the Canadian government doesn&rsquo;t care about the survival of its own people and wants to phase them out, at least we still care about our own. Or do we?</p>

		<p>I wonder if a workable solution might be to dissolve the United States not into two countries but into fifty, each state becoming an independent nation (not the first time for some of them). Each state would then have control over its own constitution, its own laws - and most importantly - its own citizenship and its own immigration regulations.</p>
<p> Each state would inevitably have to accept as citizens all U.S. citizens then resident on its soil, but could do as it pleased with non-citizens, illegals, anchor babies etc. With complete control over immigration, conservative red states would remain permanently white and would continually reinforce that character by attracting conservative whites from states which had lost it, and indeed whites from the rapidly sinking countries of Europe.</p>
<p>America, of course, is a highly unified economy but that could be maintained by a customs union. Each state would have its own armed forces but some or all of them would combine in a military alliance.This very flexible arrangement would allow states to enter into a great variety of relationships - some might prefer to surrender their independence to new federations (the north eastern blue states perhaps) others (California) might prefer to split into new blue and red states which could themselves then enter into new combinations.</p>
<p>Although there would be many very difficult issues (who gets the nukes?) this idea of universal secession, because it is based on the country&rsquo;s existing structure, would be easier to achieve than any of the other schemes for partition which I have seen. How you go about getting it is another matter! </p>

		<p>During the impeachment hearings for President Clinton George Will wrote, &#8220;The parties are polarized, but the people are not.&#8221;  <br>
 <br>
In the United States the median income adjusted for inflation began to decline during the recession of 2001.  The decline accelerated during the current Great Recession, which began December 2007.  <br>
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2009/09/closing-the-book-on-the-bush-legacy/26402/" rel="nofollow">https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2009/09/closing-the-book-on-the-bush-legacy/26402/</a><br>
 <br>
As a result, the people are polarized.  There is an inchoate suspicion that economic growth has come to an end, and that economic disputes have become zero sum games, if not negative sum games. <br>
 <br>
Consequently, the division of the United States into at least two smaller units should be taken seriously as a real possibility.  Nevertheless, the division of the United States should be seen as the collapse of the United States, equivalent to the collapse of the Soviet Union.  <br>
 <br>
A divided United States will not be able to compete economically with China, India, and the European Union.  The decline in the standard of living will escalate.  The decline in the crime rate, which began with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, will probably be reversed.  <br>

<p>Excellent post. Secessionists are without a doubt living in a fantasy world. A massive and very lethal military infrastrucute will fall into the hands of Asians if the US is ever brokenup into several race-baed nation states. Generally speaking, trillions of dollars worth of infrastructure will fall into the hands of Asians and Muslims. The consequences of this will be experienced by Native Born White Americans and it will not be pleasant. These are the king of thIngs that Native Born White Americans are going to have to think about. They-We- will be surrounded by sevEral differet race-based nation states. They didn&rsquo;t sign up for this. God only knows why secessionist want to sit down with the Chinese and Indians to discuss the terms of surrender.</p>
<p>There is another option you know:expulsion and the reclamation of Native Born White American teritory. One poster already hinted at a cordon sanitaire policy which I am in fovour of. This would be the prelude to expulsion.</p>
<p>I want-and I believe with 100 percent certainty that millions of Native Born White Americans want-a very large ocean between China and India. I do not want the borders of China and India extending deep into America-right up to the borders of the new White homelands. It is really unbelievable what secessionist are proposing</p>

		<p>Armchair generals and diplomats aside, partition is not feasible for the continued viability of a white america.  Here are some scenarios to consider.</p>
<p>#1  When the south seceded, there was a race for military assets, and what could not be taken was sabatoged.  If, as some proposed, all 50 states can become their own countries or form regional alliances, you can be darn sure all sides will be scrambling for those aircraft carriers, fighter jets, tanks, etc..  This in itself could lead to interstate fighting.</p>
<p>#2  Once the borders od each new state/federation are solidified, what happens if a mexican federation attacks, say the Carolininan federation and starts to take it over.  Will the country of Oregon intercede, or the nation of Minnesota?  I foresee the gradual chipping away of states by non-white entities like the Spanish Christians whittled away at Muslim power in Spain during the reconquista.  Those mini-muslim states didn&rsquo;t help each other and sometimes made alliances against each other with the christians.  I can see Russia, China, Mexico and internal non-whites doing this until all whites have left is some corner of Montana.</p>
<p>#3  Commerce, ahem, would cease, as each state set up border crossings, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>#4  Stupid and greedy whites would continue to import low wage mexicans into each and EVERY new statelet to harvest crops, do menial labor, etc and the cycle would wind down to ruin.  </p>
<p>Partition is surrender and oblivion.  The only viable option is to take back the country by halting all immigration, removing all illegals without coddling, cancelling all green cards, reinterpreting the 14th amendment and making it retrocative to 20 years, stripping children of illegals of citizenship because they should not have been here anyway, jailing and impoverishing any whites who knowlingly hire illegals, and, to be fair, making the law as color blind as possible so that all people, regardless of skin color, are treated equally without discrimination or SPECIAL favors.</p>

		<p>I believe this country will in fact break up, but not into two distinct nations.  It will break up mainly along state lines inititally and end the domination of the federal government. Look for Texas and Alaska to be the first to go, with several western states to follow shortly thereafter. The seceding states will forbid entry to blacks and Hispanics and whites will empty out of the prodominately black and Hispanic areas, leaving them behind to manage for themselves.</p>
<p>Obviously, for the overall movement to achieve its desired objectives and succeed, blacks and Hispanics will have to be ruthlessly excluded.  This could be achieved with much less difficulty than is commonly imagined, though there would doubtless be much economic distress from the abandonment of enormous industrial facilities and other valuable fixed assets.  But in the long term it&rsquo;s the only solution to a terminal demographic condition, which if not arrested will be the end of this nation altogether.</p>

		<p>What a great post. My views exactly. All this incessant jibber-jabber about globalization and competing in the world economy is quite frankly, revolting. Globalization essentially means forcing Native Born White Americans to compete in a globalized labor market. Globalization of labor markets can be done through either  through &#8220;free trade&#8221; or importing foreign labor-or both(Price Factor Equalization Theorem). The end result of economic globalization is a very low real wage for Native Born White Americans and the break up of America into differnt race-based nation states. That is to say, China and India get to extend their genetic borders deep inside &#8220;America&#8221;-right up to the borders of the new White Homelands beloved by Secessionists.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;They cannot engage in combat, and the fighting men of the US military (about 90% white) will not aid the Marxists., You&rsquo;ll find that a lot of liberals quickly cleave to our sides for protection&hellip; They are scared of their shadows, and you know that&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I remember hearing Charlton Heston, when he was president of the NRA, speak on a local LA radio show after the Rodney King riots.  He said during the riots, a number of on-record, loud, anti-gun, lefty celebrities nervously called and asked him if he could supply them with arms and provide a quick lesson on how to use them.  He said he just laughed.  I only wish he&rsquo;d divulged their names (although they&rsquo;d vehemently deny ever speaking to someone such as Mr. Heston).</p>
<p>Heston also stated in the same interview that Spielberg has one of the finest gun collections in California.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;No, there are no serious barriers, if we want it&hellip;. even if they want to gad about all day in a pink ballet outfit, waving a flag of Che, singing about diversity&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Let &#8216;em have it.</p>
<p>And I mean that in both senses of the statement!</p>
<p>No mercy should be shown to those who destroyed the United States and saw fit to usher in the extinction of White Americans.</p>
<p>Marxist hero Mao knew that &#8220;Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.&#8221; </p>
<p>All lofty rhetoric, bravado, threats, debate, opinion and paper shuffling matter nothing when faced with loss of living space and resources from competing, hostile outsiders  &mdash;  even animals know this and will fight to the death to protect their territory, food and offspring.</p>
<p>Even a rabbit will fight if cornered.</p>
<p>The best plan of action is to be prepared at all times.  Prepared to defend yourself and loved ones, your territory and resources, what you&rsquo;ve earned, what is yours.  Non-Whites are only too happy to take this from you, your life and that of your loved ones as well.   Learn to protect yourself, with deadly force and without mercy.  This instinct is within us despite 70 years of marxist indoctrination.  We didn&rsquo;t survive ice ages, famines, the Black Death and murderous rulers to &#8216;go quietly into that good night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Learn to handle force as a second nature so you can concentrate on the situation at hand and not your rifle, shotgun or handgun. Know that marxists are indeed marshmallows when confronted.</p>
<p>It is the ONLY way we will survive.</p>

<p>I think the way to do it is to create more of an &#8220;American Union&#8221;, as in the European Union.  There would be a common military to prevent outside aggression, and free borders for commerce.  But each new nation (whether 2, or 9, or 50, or whatever) would be able to greatly determine its own government and its own culture within its own borders.  That way, though you can&rsquo;t truly stop people from moving between nations, you would remove the incentives to do so, since that nation&rsquo;s ideology would not be up for debate.  In the long run, history will not stand still, but for the next few decades, this might be a better approach than standing idly by while America collapses.  It&rsquo;s too late to implement your suggestion about dealing with immigration.  The problems go beyond that, and are indeed ideological.  We need more ideological &#8220;spaces&#8221; in America, and will carve them out one way or another.<br>

		<p>Secession is no answer.  </p>
<p>For one thing, I find the whole &#8220;Red State vs. Blue State&#8221; schism to be vastly overblown.  Differences in lifestyles and beliefs between the two sensibilities, while real, aren&rsquo;t nearly as large as our juiced-up punditocracy would have us believe.  </p>
<p>For another, once set in motion, secession begets more secession, increasingly on racial/ethnic lines.  If you&rsquo;re a white, for example, try entering the newly-created People&rsquo;s Republic of New Mexico, and see how welcome you are among the Mexican ethnics.  If I were a white artist living in Taos or Santa Fe, personally I&rsquo;d make one-way travel plans   &mdash;   and quickly.  Even those Lew Rockwell/New Confederate types might backtrack on their views.  </p>
<p>Secession is a copout, an easy way out for people unwilling to fight for their ever-shrinking (and ever-weakening) country.  And this country is called America. </p>

		<p>As the orignial article says, much of the existing industrial physical infrastructure exists around larger metro areas that would likely be included in the Blue.  Most of the physical manual labor also work and live in these areas.   </p>
<p>But alot of the advanced labor that runs the company - executives, planners, thinkers, strategists, managers, etc. - work and live in the suburbs and exurbs, which might be included in the new Red AFR.  Much of the capital comes from these areas also - shareholders, venture capitalists, banks, etc.</p>
<p>How would this be resolved - would cross-nation corporations be permitted (by both sides), or would resources have to move in order to be totally included in only one nation?  If there&rsquo;s cross-nation functionality, then are taxes paid to both nations?    <br>

		<p>&#8220;Independent homeland&#8221; means a nation, you know, like the United States used to be&hellip;as opposed to being a cog in the global machine.  And haven&rsquo;t you noticed that globalization isn&rsquo;t working either?</p>
<p>Purging DC from the United States would be the better option.  DC is loyal to the old British/European powers, which seek to destroy the United States.</p>

Good idea, but easier said than done!  Those in ultimate control  will remain well disguised; many will shift over to the winning side and pretend to have been there all along. You&rsquo;ll still have them with you, but wearing different stripes, that&rsquo;s all. They are very experienced chameleons. They know how to place their chips and how to leverage these things. They back every team to be assured of a place at the negotiating table.</p>

		<p>I do not think a break up of the country is necessary or advisable along any lines.  Nor do I think that a bloody Civil War Part DUH is necessary, either.</p>
<p>Whites just need to refuse to cooperate in their own dispossession.  </p>
<p>1) Cut your expenses to the bone. Make a point of being the biggest tightwad imaginable.  Buy nothing new.  Trade wherever you can.  Plant a garden and raise some chickens.  </p>
<p>2) Don&rsquo;t be ambitious.  Work as little as possible.  Be aggressive about always, always making less than what the government considers &#8220;rich.&#8221;</p>
<p>3) Have as many children as possible.  EITC benefits mean you are paying for someone&rsquo;s children anyway.  Might as well be your own.</p>
<p>Instead of paying for an increasingly overwhelmed social services system, Whites need to eliminate it altogether.  The bet way to do that is to destroy it by jumping on it ourselves.  Because it is the magnet for the entire Third World overwhelming our shores right now.</p>
<p>Once that happens, there will be a huge Mexodus at our southern border.  Our &#8220;reconquistadores&#8221; are very pragmatic people.  The Mexicans will pick up their anchor babies and any loot they have acquired here in the USA and go home.  Believe me, many of them have been sending money home for years, have paid up farms and money in the bank.  They are not going to suffer for any bleeding heart liberals still worried about them.  I know this for a fact, because I understand Spanish and have listened to them talking about their plans for when it hits in America.  I don&rsquo;t see an &#8220;Azatlan&#8221; in our future (unless Whites continue bankrolling it through their taxes).  That is probably the case with the rest of Latin America, too.  </p>
<p>The only problem I foresee is our black &#8220;children&#8221; who a liberal, patriarchal White system have raised to be spoiled and entitled.  When the government checks stop rolling in and they are told they can&rsquo;t expect a free lunch anymore, expect them to throw a collective tantrum.  Well, we will have no choice but crack down on them.    If that means making such antics capital offenses, with speedy trials and executions right outside the courthouse doors, so be it.  But order will be restored and the criminal elements will be purged.</p>
<p>I am not worried as the rest of you.  Whites have always been the minority in this world.  The only thing that has been standing against us and total extinction is force of will.  That has always been the case and it will be now.  Once this idiotic experiment in multicultural liberalism is over, expect Whites to come out much with much more racial realism and anytime some bleeding heart liberal wants to help any other race, anyone listening to him will take his head off.</p>

<p>The Late Birdman always claimed they are experts at playing off of our weaknesses  &mdash;  as in they understand our psychology better than we do and use it to great effect against us (and to their own benefit, of course).  Having high IQs has benefitted them tremendously as well, and they network ferociously (what Professor MacDonald calls &#8216;the flying wedge&rsquo;).  Defy them at great risk.</p>

<p>Their ultimate goal is our destruction and elimination.  We are going to be killed off no matter what  and that is why we must fight; it won&rsquo;t be easy and it will be bloody as it was in the old USSR.  It took 63 million lives to free that country from marxist tyranny and bloodlust.</p>
<p>We are currently being systematically dehumanized to non-Whites to make their task of destroying us easier.</p>
