<h1><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1290690/The-British-towns-worker-migrant.html">Revealed: The British Towns Where One Worker in Two Is a Migrant</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Slack, Daily Mail (London), June 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A map today reveals parts of Britain where more than half of jobs are held by workers who were born overseas.</p>
<p>The workforce in large parts of London is dominated by people born abroad  &mdash;  despite Labour&rsquo;s repeated promises to deliver &#8216;British jobs for British workers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But foreign-born employees also have a strong foothold in other British towns and cities, from Slough and Reading to Manchester.</p>
<p>Campaigners said the focus of employers and Whitehall should be on finding jobs for the young Britons out of work in many of these areas.</p>
<p>And last night, immigration minister Damian Green said: &#8216;This shows why we need a limit on work visas as well as a better trained British workforce.</p>
<p>The most startling figures, based on information from the Office for National Statistics, relate to Newham  &mdash;  the East London borough hosting the 2012 Olympics.</p>
<p>Here, almost seven in every ten jobs are filled by workers who were not born in the UK  &mdash;  or 65,100 out of 93,700 posts. Many of the jobs are on the Olympic site itself.</p>
<p>The number of British-born people in Newham who are not in work is 25,600. This is a combination of the unemployed and those classed as &#8216;economically inactive&rsquo;, such as students and the long-term sick.</p>
<p>There are six local authority areas where more than 50 per cent of the jobs are filled by migrant workers  &mdash;  and a further 18 where those born outside the UK take up more than one in every three jobs.</p>
<p>Outside London, the areas where the biggest proportion of jobs are taken by immigrants are Slough, Leicester, Luton, Reading, Cambridge, Manchester and Oxford.</p>
<p>Crawley, in West Sussex, and Elmbridge, in Surrey, are also at the top of the list.</p>
<p>Many overseas workers in places such as Slough and Reading are Eastern Europeans who do not need work permits.</p>
<p>Experts say this makes it more important for the Government to impose a strict cap on non-EU migrants in an attempt to bring the total number of foreign workers under control.</p>
<p>The coalition unveiled an interim cap this week, along with a plan to make employers provide non-EU migrants with private healthcare to ease pressure on the NHS.</p>
<p>The final level of the cap will be decided later this year.</p>
<p>Alp Mehmet, of MigrationWatch, said: &#8216;Where there are gaps in the UK labour market we should be filling them from the UK population.</p>
<p>&#8216;There is a laxness and a looseness about the way people are allowed in. What we want is closer control.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The area with the smallest proportion of foreign-born workers is Newark and Sherwood, in Nottinghamshire, at 1.5 per cent.</p>
<p>Under Labour more than 1.1million jobs  &mdash;  half the total created  &mdash;  were taken by non-EU immigrants requiring work permits, according to the independent House of Commons Library.</p>
<p>In October 1997, British-born workers made up 92.5 per cent of the workforce. By 2009, this had fallen to 87.1 per cent.</p>

		<p>The British people have no one but themselves to blame.  They have been told these lies for years and seen up close that they are lies.  When their neighbors lost their jobs and complained, they attacked them as racists and passed laws that resulted in those people being sent to prison for speaking up.  No matter how bad it got, they voted for the ones doing this and demonized any who wanted to stop it.  Now, most white Brits live as second class citizens with a very low standard of living.  Racist violence against whites is common place.  Those that rape, rob, murder assault whites are rarely punished.  Those that complain about this are routinely punished.  And STILL, anyone who mentions that these things exist are spat upon and called racist.</p>
<p>The only solution has become emmigration.  Although I think various nations should seriously consider refusing to take whites from Britain.  Anyone who wants to leave should be closely scrutinized to see if they still hold to the beliefs that created this situation.  If they do, they should be refused&hellip;.and forced to live with the way things are in Britain.</p>

		<p>The fact is that anyone who actually knows the east London boroughs of Newham, Hackney, Ilford, Tower Hamlets, Walthamstow etc will attest to you that whites (particularly native Whites) are very thin on the ground there.<br>
 I fact all these areas resemble Lahore or Karachi more than an English town.</p>

<blockquote>The British people have no one but themselves to blame. </blockquote>
<p>I absolutely agree. They have reasonable right wing parties. They have a very free press and they have -compared to Germany- very smart people who criticize multi culti without being called racist. They have a scandal in which lefties showed they wanted immigration so right wing can&rsquo;t win power.</p>
<p>The once strongest country in the world is made with &#8220;the strength of diversity&#8221; to one which will maybe not remembered in 50 years like Rhodesia. And the people are still voting left.</p>

		<p>I had the misfortune of visiting Newham last year. The neighbourhood was a mix of blacks, browns, and some whites.  The general atmosphere was that of any bad area  &mdash;  trash and empty cans of cheap cider in the front yards, boarded-up houses, liquor bottles inside phone booths and at bus stops, security guards in the supermarkets, and surveillance cameras. Not overtly dangerous but nowhere you&rsquo;d feel like walking around.</p>

		<p>I live in a small market town near Cambridge, a town mentioned in the report above, so the influx of foreigners means I can walk from my home to the town centre (10 minutes) and not hear English being spoken.</p>
<p>The only occasions I&rsquo;ve had trouble in a pub its been foreigners that have started.</p>
<p>I could go on but I wont.</p>

		<p>I am from North east England where Labour have had a stranglehold on local councils and Westminster seats since before I was born.I work in construction so needless to say all of my peers are working class.Whan I told them that I voted B.N.P. in the last Election I was compared to Oswald Mosley and his blackshirts.<br>
Only two labour seats were lost in the North East in the last election.People here have been so indoctrinated into voting labour I don&rsquo;t think it will ever change.</p>

		<p>So &#8220;the British have no one but themselves to blame&#8221;?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always depressing to encounter the (usually, as here, anonymous) American Anglophobes, who delight in any opportunity to give the British (and, specifically, the English) a good kicking, blaming the ordinary people for the appalling misfortunes inflicted upon them by their political elites.</p>
<p>Rather than spitting out this kind of bile, you would do better to visit Britain, get to know some indigenous people, and find out something about how our electoral system (and our lying mass media and the politically-correct brainwashing factories that masquerade as educational establishments) together with savage laws against &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; (particularly including the expression of dissent from past and present immigration policies and their sociocultural consequences) work to cow and silence the populace it does not actually mislead or confuse.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll bother; mindlessly hating the British is just too much fun.</p>

		<p>The Eastern Europeans are doing the jobs that people from the Indian subcontinent and from Africa won&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t do, because Newham is in my personal experience the most non-white place I have ever visited in the UK. You really can play &#8220;spot the white man&#8221;. That is why white men have had to be brought over from Europe, because blacks and browns haven&rsquo;t got what it takes to do these construction jobs.</p>

		<p>Johnny English has a very good point.  We should not offer smug satisfaction at what is happening in England.  The SAME thing is happening here in America, for the SAME reasons, and far too many AMERICANS are likewise voting themselves out of existence.<br>
We are just behind them a little in progression of this cancer.  The MAIN culprits in white self-eradication?  Public school indoctrination, and media complicity in making sure NOTHING is said which goes against the Liberal/Labor agenda while disparaging ANY voice against what is happening.  Same here as there.  THOSE are the traitors and THOSE institutions should be taken to task by the populations being displaced - one way or another.  Without the constant complicity of the lying public schools and media, folks would be less indoctrinated and more aware.  </p>

		<p>you would do better to visit Britain</p>
<p><br>
I can&rsquo;t visit Britain&hellip;.you passed laws that would put me in jail for my beliefs.  Also, the weapons I carry with me at all times (legally) to make sure me and my family don&rsquo;t become victims of non-whites are not allowed there.  However, I highly encourage you to come to America, and join the large groups of people who actually do something to put a stop to this stuff.  I would no more visit Britain than I would North Korea&hellip;.and for the same reasons&hellip;..the government is insane and the people who live there LIKE IT THAT WAY.</p>
<p>Maybe one day, when the US is again a white nation, something can be done about Britain.  But for now, I rather think you should be more concerned about the bile your neighbors are directing your way than anything I might have to say.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t live in Britain.  Nor do I live in zimbabwe or south africa.  But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t (or shouldn&rsquo;t) point out that white people in all three countries are lying down for genocide without a fight.  And that is SHAMEFUL.</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, unless there is significant resistance building that needs international support, I don&rsquo;t really care.  What I said was for the benefit of white Americans and white Canadians, perhaps whites in other countries that haven&rsquo;t fallen so far.  Don&rsquo;t copy Britain, is the message.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s true that we have &#8220;reasonable right-wing parties&#8221; (if by &#8220;right-wing&#8221; you simply mean anti-mass immigration/multiculturalism/political correctness) in the UK (the most reasonable being the BNP). However, if you consult the BNP&rsquo;s own web site, you will appreciate the level of persecution such parties routinely suffer. (The state-sponsored race-relations industry here is waging a more-or-less permanent war of attrition in the courts against the BNP to bankrupt the party through costly litigation.) </p>
<p>What happened in Barking at the most recent General Election where the BNP were expected to do well (a prospect feared by the political establishment and their MSM underlings)? The BNP&rsquo;s expected voter-base &#8220;mysteriously&#8221; collapsed, and they lost both of their existing seats on the local council. Not so mysterious, really. Substantial numbers of blacks and browns had been bussed into the neighbourhood and directed to the polling stations, other third-worlders&rsquo; postal votes were systematically abused (to boost New Labour) and up and down the country the poor level of security and confidentiality at polling stations shocked international observers from such thriving bastions of democratic probity as Senegal. Given the biased nature of the types of people who volunteer to staff the polling stations and count the vote, it&rsquo;s more than likely that a significant portion of ballot papers supporting the BNP simply went &#8220;missing&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ted, from the North-East of England, is also right to point out the pathetic tribalism that still exists among the indigenous working class in the old industrial areas of the English provinces. They have, as Ted points out, been brainwashed by the MSM to hate the only political party - the BNP - that offers them genuine salvation, and to shun anyone who expresses even the mildest agreement or sympathy with them. </p>
<p>These fools and dupes need to be forced to live on the minimum wage for a year in the top floor of a tower block in Peckham, Tottenham or Handsworth, or the most Islamised areas of Bradford. They also need to see the disconnect between their lives and values and those of the Metropolitan New Labour types they have chosen as their representatives in Parliament. Until then, they are just turkeys voting for Christmas.</p>
