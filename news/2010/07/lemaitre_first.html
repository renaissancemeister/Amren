		<p>Lemaitre is one of the youngest of the top sprinters as well. He could very well medal in the next Olympics in both the 100 and the 200.</p>
<p>As recently as 1980, a white man - Alan Wells - won the gold in the 100 meters.</p>

		<p>The world record in the 100m is currently held by Usain Bolt at 9.58 seconds.  Lemaitre is only .40 seconds slower.  Do the math.  The fastest Black man is only 4% faster than the fastest White man.  The smartest Black africans have IQs in the 100, maybe 115 range, according to Dr. Philippe Rushton.  The smartest Whites on record have IQs in excess of 200  &mdash;  a hundred percent advantage.  Now really, who&rsquo;s really got something to brag about?<br/>

		<p>This clear disparity between black and white performance in certain track and field events calls for affirmative action to balance outcomes.</p>
<p>Perhaps black sprinters should perform in ski boots to level the playing field.</p>

		<p>In 1972 Valery Borzov of the U.S.S.R. won the Gold Medal in the 100 and 200 meter sprints.  Borzov was a White Russian.  In one of the preliminary heats the two American sprinters - Eddie Hart and Rey Robinson - both Black, failed to appear for their quarter final races because their coach - another Black man - Stan Wright, had an antiquated schedule.  Borzov went on to win the gold medal the next day, and very easily I might add.</p>
<p>The American media would not give and still does not give Borzov a great deal of credit for his victories.  This is part and parcel of the media&rsquo;s agenda of constantly &#8220;uplifting&#8221; Black athletes and putting down White athletes - especially heterosexual White males.  Both Hart and Robinson had been touted as co-holders of the world record in the 100 meters.  It seems that they had been timed in 9.9 seconds in the Olympic Trials.  However these were hand-timed 100 meters which were usually slower than electronically timed races.  Also all world records in 1972 were ratified only with electronic timing, yet, the very pro-Black mainstream media touted their 9.9&rsquo;s as official world records.  If one views the 1972 trials, and the race can be viewed here -</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2v586eq" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2v586eq</a></p>
<p>- you can see that the man who eventually finished 2nd to Borzov in the Olympic Final - Robert Taylor - was actually timed in 10.0 in the Olympic trial race whereas in the Olympic final, he finished 2nd to Borzov in 10.26 - a far more distant 2nd. Taylor finished much closer to Hart and Robinson in the Olympic Trials than he did to Borzov in the Olympic final.  Incidentally the 1972 Olympic 100 meters can be viewed in the url above.</p>
<p>It is said that the American media did not want to give Borzov much credit because he was from the Soviet Union and in 1972 the Cold War was still on.  That is not true.  Another Soviet athlete of the SAME OLYMPIC GAMES - 1972 - was literally the darling of the American media, and that person was Olga Korbut, the Russian gymnast who won 3 Gold Medals.  No, the American medias&rsquo; behavior had nothing to do with the fact that Borzov was from a communist country.  It had all to do with the fact that he was a White Heterosexual Man competing against Blacks and by defeating the American Blacks, he interfered with the American media&rsquo;s false portrayal of Blacks being invincible on the athletic field.</p>

		<p>I agree with a previous poster that Christophe Lemaitre is not the type of athlete the US media/entertainment industry feel comfortable portraying.  I recall in 1996 when the best heavyweight boxers in the world were black, Hollywood produced the movie &#8220;The Great White Hype,&#8221; which mocked the dearth of white heavyweights on the world scene.  The Klitschko brothers from Ukraine are currently the best two heavyweights in the world, and 7 in the top 10 are white.  Although wildly popular in Europe, the Klitschkos were dropped recently by HBO.  We&rsquo;re told they simply don&rsquo;t have any commercial appeal.  If the top two heavyweights in the world were the brothers Tyrell and Leroy Jackson from the Bronx, the media would create the appeal.  There would be 24/7/365 saturation coverage of the heroic brothers who overcame institutional racism to achieve greatness.                  <br/>

		<p>I think most persons are objectively able to agree that, on average, blacks have better inherited sprinting speed than whites - and sprinting skills are not something that change much with better coaching, though proper technique is important to improve anyone&rsquo;s native ability as a sprinter.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine that sprinting speed determined entry into colleges and universities, and that given the fact that whites were not achieving entry at the approximate percentage level as blacks, that a new program of the Federal Government were set up, &#8220;No sprinter left behind.&#8221; If not enough whites sprinted &#8220;up to speed&#8221;, then it was the coaches fault for not using the correct techniques, or else blacks must be training on better tracks. But the reality would be that no matter how much money were thrown at the problem, that the &#8220;sprinting gap&#8221; between whites and blacks would persist.</p>
<p>This is the reality with the U.S. educational system today and the &#8220;No Child Left Behind&#8221; Act. Since everyone is required to keep up an &#8220;Emperor&rsquo;s new pair of clothes&#8221; attitude to the realities of inherited differences in I.Q. among racial groups, it is impossible for people to see the heretical truth that just as native abilities allow blacks, on average, to be better sprinters than whites, the same is true as regards intellectual achievement, with whites in this case having hereditary advantages.</p>
<p>Western Civilization developed in the West because of the kind of intellectual skills the elite of European background peoples have as part of their genetic inheritance, and to deny this may be politically correct but it is not reality.</p>

<p>IQ  scores  are  largely  functions  of the  environment so  this  fact  must  be  factored  into an  individual&rsquo;s  nominal  score. With  that  in  mind it  is  argued  that doctorates in  physics, electrical engineering and  mathematics, for example, correlate  with  an  IQ  of  at  least  135.  Well  there  are  hundreds  of Africans[just  take  a  large  population  place  like  Nigeria] with doctorates in these areas  which  they obtained  from places like  MIT and  Caltech.  It&rsquo;s  all there  in  the records.</p>

		<p>This is purely an amateur observation on my part, and is probably subject to correction.  But I have noticed that in the universe of elite 100m sprinters on the international level, blacks (i.e. west Africans, either from Africa or their diaspora in Europe or North America) turn in their best career times in the 20-25 age range.  The few whites that are credible in that universe peak in the 25-30 age range.</p>
<p>Lemaitre turned 20 last month, so he will be 22 for London, 26 for Rio and 30 for wherever the 2020 Summer Games will be held.  While he has a credible shot to do well enough in the 100 in London to make the finals in that discipline, he&rsquo;ll be 22, not yet in his peak (if my amateurish racial generalities hold), competing against a lot of blacks in their prime.  So I doubt he can medal in London.  However, in Rio and in 2020, he&rsquo;ll be in his prime competing against younger blacks in their prime  &mdash;  Don&rsquo;t be surprised if he becomes the first white man in a very long time to earn a 100m medal at one of those two Games.</p>
<p>BTW, Usain Bolt?  Roiding.  Mark me.</p>

		<p>When Black men wanted to move faster, they accomplished it with 100,000 years of selective breeding, environmental conditioning, and evolution.</p>
<p>When White men wanted to move faster, they domesticated the horse and learned to ride, built wagons, invented steam power and locomotives, automobiles, the internal combustion engine, gliders, powered flight, jet aircraft, bullet trains, rockets, etc.</p>
<p>Somehow the lack of a White man able to run 100 meters in less than 9.6 seconds doesn&rsquo;t seem like all that glaring a deficiency.</p>

		<p>THe long standing (42 years) world record for the standing broad jump, which is the standard power leap is held by Norwegian Arne Tvervaag, who jumped 3.71 meters. </p>
<p>Norwegians have an extremely high ratio of olympic gold medals per capita.  </p>

		<p>The name of the sport is &#8220;Track&Field;&#8221;. The lame-stream media all but ignores the FIELD events such as shot-put, javelin, discus, polevault etc. because these events are won overwhelmingly by white atheletes due to superior upper body strength. Don&rsquo;t believe whites are stronger? When&rsquo;s the last time a black won the &#8220;World&rsquo;s Strongest Man Contest&#8221;(it&rsquo;s been around for over 30 years now), I&rsquo;ll give you a hint&hellip; NEVER  </p>

I&rsquo;ve done some research on IQs myself and it is a topic of interest to me, so I couldn&rsquo;t help responding to your wild assertions. The top three IQs on record are Kim Ung Yong (Korean, 210), Chris Langan (White American, 195), Phillip Emeagwali (Black Nigerian, 190). The top of the IQ scale is much more diverse than that of sprinting. I just had to clarify that.  <br/>
Nonetheless, I wouldn&rsquo;t put too much faith in actual IQ scores. Since culture and environment play a role in the way people answer the test questions, it is not a completely accurate indicator of any disparities among populations. </p>
