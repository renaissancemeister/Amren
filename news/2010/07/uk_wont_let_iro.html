			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sify News, July 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An American Indian lacrosse team will not be allowed entry into England for the world championship of the sport the Iroquois helped invent unless members accept U.S. or Canadian passports, the British government said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Iroquois Nationals team won&rsquo;t be attending the tournament in Manchester unless the British government reverses its decision and allows them to use passports issued by the Iroquois Confederacy, said Tonya Gonnella Frichner, a lawyer for the team.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re telling us: &#8216;Go get U.S. passports or Canadian passports,&rsquo;&#8221; Frichner said Wednesday shortly after getting the news. &#8220;It&rsquo;s pretty devastating.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team&rsquo;s 23 players  &mdash;  who are all eligible for passports issued by those nations  &mdash;  say that accepting them would be a strike against their identity.</p>
<p>In a statement, the U.K. Borders Agency said: &#8220;Like all those seeking entry into the U.K., they must present a document that we recognise as valid to enable us to complete our immigration and other checks.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Dan Maffei, D-N.Y., urged the British to reconsider their decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the British or any national entity seeks to sever this Iroquois Nationals team from their own national identity, then they&rsquo;re asking them to not be the athletes that they are,&#8221; he said in a statement, calling it an &#8220;international embarrassment&#8221; if they&rsquo;re not allowed to compete.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Iroquois team is ranked No. 4 by the Federation of International Lacrosse and represents the Haudenosaunee  &mdash;  an Iroquois Confederacy of the Oneida, Seneca, Mohawk, Tuscarora, Cayuga and Onondaga nations, whose land stretches from upstate New York into Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. authorities had said the issue was a matter of border security rather than Iroquois sovereignty.</p>
<p>&#8220;For other countries, including the United States, that is not a travel document that is on par with a U.S. passport,&#8221; Crowley said of the Iroquois documents. He noted that the Iroquois have had similar problems with their passports in foreign countries before.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best way to open doors around the world is to obtain a U.S. passport,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip} The Iroquois documents look similar to U.S. passports but are emblazoned with a Haudenosaunee insignia featuring a tree and animal emblems. The simple blue booklet is made with thinner paper than U.S. passports, has no high-tech chips and some information is handwritten.</p>
<p>At least four Indian nations, including the Kootenai of Idaho; the Pasqua Yaqui of Arizona; the Tohono O&rsquo;odham Nation of Arizona and Mexico; and the Seneca of New York have been working with federal officials to develop ID cards that meet new security guidelines, but they would be good only for arrivals in the U.S. by land or sea, according to the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Frichner, who also is the North American Regional Representative to the U.N. Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, said the Iroquois have almost completed a transition to higher security passports. The process has cost the six-nation confederacy more than $1.5 million, she said.</p>

								<h2>US Allowing Iroquois Lacrosse Team to Travel to UK</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Samantha Gross, Google News, July 14, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The U.S. government, at Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton&rsquo;s behest, agreed to allow a Native American lacrosse team to travel to England for a world championship competition under passports issued by the Iroquois Confederacy.</p>
<p>Clinton determined that the Iroquois team members did not need U.S. passports to make the trip and granted the players a &#8220;one-time-only waiver&#8221; to travel on their Iroquois Confederation passports, said State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley. The team members regard U.S. government-issued documents as an attack on their identity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. officials previously informed the team that new security rules for international travelers meant that their old passports  &mdash;  low-tech, partly handwritten documents issued by the Iroquois Confederacy of six Indian nations  &mdash;  wouldn&rsquo;t be honored.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Iroquois Confederacy oversees land that stretches from upstate New York into Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>The Iroquois helped invent lacrosse, perhaps as early as 1,000 years ago. Their participation in the once-every-four-year world championship tournament is a rare example of international recognition of their sovereignty.</p>

		<p>This foolishness has gone on far to long.  Guess what Iroquois, you don&rsquo;t exist anymore, just like the Mayan passport wont work either.  Pandering to conquered races is the first step to the end.  My native country was over run several times, get over it and move on.  If the past is all you have then your future is behind you.</p>

		<p>My advice to those Indians would be: put aside whatever animosities you have toward the U.S. and Canadian governments, travel on either a U.S, or a Canadian passport, along with two, or three, mimeographed copies of such a passport.  Rather than use an Iroquois Indian Nations passport, even the British government decides to change its policy and allow Iroquois passports.</p>
<p>This is the common sense reason why, if a U.S. or a Canadian passport gets lost or stolen, these Indians can simply go to the U.S. or Canadian embassy and have it replaced with perhaps either another passport, or an emergency document to come home.</p>
<p>But even if the British goverment decides to accept Iroquois Nations passports, and such a passport gets lost or stolen, the Indian losing it would really have a problem, because no Indians in Canada, or the U.S. have any embassies abroad!</p>
<p>And speaking of passports I am going to mention another subject, not related to this article.</p>
<p>During the apartheid era, South Africans were banned from traveling to Kenya and Tanzania.  These means Afrikaners, and other South Africans, could not visit the Serengetti, see the annual Wildbeast migration, and see other safari wonders those countries have to offer.  </p>
<p>Therefore, I wonder, during the apartheid era, did any South Africans ever aquire second passports as means to legally circumvent these travel bans, in order to be able to visit Kenya and Tanzania?</p>

		<p>Re: &#8216;foolishness&rsquo; and &#8216;get over it&rsquo; - why should they? They discovered the land, have the deepest possible right to it. The govt. treated them as sovereign nations later, when it wasn&rsquo;t inconvenient. And, theirs is a diversity that&rsquo;s /worth/ preserving; the Iriquois especially. I understand a lot of Indians were basically anarchist. Well, the Iriquois were a lot of that and one better - they had a fantastically interwoven and sensible form of govt, google them or look it up on Wikipedia (there&rsquo;s a chapter in Kim Stanley Robinson&rsquo;s &#8220;Years of Rice and Salt&#8221;, too). If democracy is one step away from tyranny, anarchism is the logical next step, and the Iriquois found a way to balance that with people living together. Iriquois aren&rsquo;t looking for handouts or special privileges, at least not in this instance; they&rsquo;re looking to be themselves. If you can&rsquo;t resonate with and respect that, you&rsquo;re weak and impoverished, I say. </p>

		<p>This is sad in one respect, because these people to whom I am distantly related invented Lacrosse.  It is also unneeded, because politics and team sportmanship combine to produce the hideous combination some other people to whom I am much more closely related did their best to perfect.  We call that &#8220;war&#8221;.</p>
<p>Let it remain a game, and travel under a genuine passport.  Once you&rsquo;re there, do a good job and win.</p>

		<p>I say let the Iroquois travel on Iroquois passports when the Confederate States can travel to the UK on a Confederate States passport.  And NOT before.  Otherwise, they should get over it.  The Iroquois, and all indian nations, seem to want to be sovereign nations when it suits them, and at other times want all the rights and privileges of the sovereign United States.    Either you ARE a citizen of the United States, or you AREN&rsquo;T.  If you aren&rsquo;t then do without our services and privileges.  You don&rsquo;t get to play it both ways.  </p>

		<p>North American aborigine tribes are U.S. citizens under federal law, so they should travel under U.S. passports.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somewhat bemused by all this, since the Iroquois tribe was allied with the British, long before the American Revolution. This came about as a result of French explorer Samuel Champlain joining an anti-Iroquois war party (the other tribe&rsquo;s name escapes me). The Iroquois swore revenge against the French, and allied themselves with the British.</p>

		<p>The problem is not with the Iriquois pushing their luck by traveling on illegal unacceptable documents although they should not be allowed to leave the USA without a legal document, ie a proper passport.  It is that the UK has every right to refuse entry to people without the correct internationally accepted identification documents just as the USA has but at this time with especially Mexican ones seems to be more than a little lax in doing so except in good old AZ.  I love the USA and worked there in 1968 to 1970, enjoying seeing the first steps on the moon by an American astronaut with American friends, but hey you guys, we had all better get ourselves sorted out very soon and have the rules of Law enforced  by the governments otherwise blood will be flowing freely in the streets in a few years&rsquo; time as has been forecast by a prominent UK politician almost 50 years ago. Time to stop talking as AZ has done and start acting by forcing the elected representatives to obey the wishes of the legal voters now.<br>

<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to believe that the original five nations which formed the Iroquois league in the 16th century were actually the first people to set foot on the continent, but it hardly matters who got here first. Even if the Iroquois were the first ones here, this idea that first discovery implies perpetual ownership is a complete fiction. Things just don&rsquo;t work that way in the real world.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t see the connection between &#8220;identity&#8221; and issuing your own passports. There&rsquo;s a big difference between &#8220;trying to be yourself&#8221; and setting yourself up as a sovereign nation which seems to be what they&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>Having said all that, however, I hope that they actually get away with this. Gaining the right to issue their own passports would be a symbolic first step towards true nationhood and might  &mdash;  in some small way  &mdash;  accelerate the breakup of this decaying multicultural empire that used to be the United States.</p>

		<p>If the American Indian nations are not sovereign nations, they certainly ought to be. The principles of nationhood and sovereignty must begin somewhere. Let the American Indian show Whites the true meaning of nation-states! They have retained what most Whites have sadly lost   &mdash;   a strong and abiding sense of ethnic-national identity.</p>

		<p>The wisdom of the President on our 20$ bills, and his wars against the Amerindians, is now evident. As the British historian Paul Johnson points out in his &#8220;A History of the American people&#8221;, had politically and territorially cohesive Indian polities been allowed to exist into the age of the United Nations and &#8216;Diversity&rsquo;, our land would be a crazy patchwork of hostile, third-world Banana Republics. On the other hand, perhaps that very fact would have prevented the current MultiCulti craze: an America which (like say Israel today) would have to perennially worry about bloody borders and the infiltration of its frontier villages by violent non-White marauders with an ethno-cultural grudge, would not breed the arrogance of a Woodrow Wilson, nor set up an organization such as the UN to begin with. It certainly would limit its allowed immigrants to the pool of White Christian Europeans.</p>

Our national census does not permit me to class myself as &#8216;White English&rsquo; although there are tick boxes for Welsh, Scottish and Irish &#8216;Whites&rsquo;. I may not hold an English Passport, I have a UK British passport instead. If I tried to travel to USA on an &#8216;English&rsquo; passport (and there are some &#8216;unofficial&rsquo; documents to be had), I wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to buy a ticket. You Americans now demand my bank details before you will issue me with a visa. Sod you, and your sports team.</p>

<p>But that was long before the Revolution. The Iroqois were not a tribe but a confederation of six  tribes.  While it is true that they had traditionally been allied with the British (and before them the Dutch),  against the French, not all of the tribes participated in the Revolution on the side of the British crown. Even the Seneca declared themselves officially neutral, but they overwhelmingly sided with the Britain, to their regret.  And though attempting to maintain neutrality, many Oneida and Tuscarora, and some Cayuga, sided  and fought with with the colonists.  <br>

<p><br>
Among the many excellent posts above, the one by Western Man is particularly thought-provoking. Yes, Pres. Jackson was a tough, no-nonsense politician who looked out for his people, whatever measures it took to do so. He did not flinch to do the necessary and order Indian removal.  Without him, the USA would be an unviable mess today. We need someone like that now!</p>
<p>I also sympathize with Yorkshire man, but I fail to understand his grudge against &#8220;our&#8221; sports team. Does he think we are all Mohawks?  Incidentally, the Iroquois, faithful allies of the British crown, are being treated rather shabbily by Britain&rsquo;s government today.  Shame!  So much for gratitude!</p>

		<p>Ah! ghw must not have read many of my past AMREN comments. Yorkshiremen have a rather sardonic &#8216;sui generis&rsquo; sense of humour. This lacrosse international fest was held in England in 1978 when Canada won and again in 1994 when victory went to the USA. So which passports were used then? Lacrosse is not exactly a national pastime in England but if the Iroquois lacrosse team were to play the English football team at soccer during their visit I would bet on the visitors as the English team has a foreign manager and very few English players  Not sure if the alliance of the Iroquois (5 nations) during the war of independence was an asset or a hindrance but history records that the Brits lost and we have not availed ourselves of their warlike services since. Anyway, I think their support was a toss-up between the French (who hated them) and the English who hated the French. Anyway our uniforms were prettier.</p>

		<p>Yes, the Iroquois were fair fighters, but there are some quite good reasons why they currently control as little of the US northeast as they now do.  Hint; it wasn&rsquo;t lost Lacrosse games that cost them territory, any more than soccer games which determined Europe&rsquo;s current borders.</p>
<p>The other thing that gripes me about this is that the episode smacks of the same childishness that saw the US and USSR respectively take turns boycotting Olympic games in the other&rsquo;s nations in 1980 and 1984.  If I&rsquo;d have been a US Olympic athelete in 1980, I&rsquo;d have gone to the USSR to compete anyway, after publically telling Jimmy Carter to go **** himself, as every American Olympic athelete should have done at the time.</p>

		<p>Certainly they want to be recognized as a sovereign nation.  An athletic event, however is the wrong forum for this, just as an athletic event was an imbecilic forum for the 1980 chastisement of the USSR for having invaded Afghanistan.  Moreover, if the Iroquois really want recognition as independent, they must immediately cease receiving any sort of handouts from the US federal and New York state governments.  My suspicion is that they want it both ways, like a spoiled twenty-something who flaunts &#8220;independence&#8221; while continuing to live at home and sponge off their parents.</p>
<p>Finally, if they keep saying &#8220;We are Iroquois and not Americans&#8221;, what do you think will happen when the rest of us finally start to agree with them?</p>
