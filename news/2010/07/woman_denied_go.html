			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Lilley, Ottawa Sun, July 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A stay-at-home mother trying to re-enter the workforce after nine years away says she can&rsquo;t understand why the federal government would stop her from applying for a job simply because she is white.</p>
<p>Sara Landriault, a sometime family activist, says that with her kids in school full time she decided to start looking for work outside of the home.</p>
<p>While surfing on the federal government job website, Landriault says she found a position at Citizenship and Immigration Canada she felt she was qualified for but was blocked from submitting her resume because she was not an aboriginal or visible minority.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was flabbergasted,&#8221; Landriault said in a telephone interview from her home in Kemptville, Ont., just south of Ottawa. &#8220;It was insane. I&rsquo;m white, so I can&rsquo;t do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Landriault says she has seen job postings in the past that encourage certain groups to apply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is fine, it&rsquo;s an equal opportunity position,&#8221; Landriault said. &#8220;But an equal opportunity employer does not stop one race from applying.&#8221;</p>
<p>A CIC spokeswoman takes a different view.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are under-represented by aboriginal employees in our work force,&#8221; said Melanie Carkner. &#8220;At this point in time, the department does meet requirements for visible minorities; however, given the department&rsquo;s mandate, we make a concerted effort to hire individuals in this group.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Employment Equity Act, first introduced by the Mulroney government in 1986 and updated by the Chretien government in 1995, allows for certain groups to be favoured when it comes to hiring.</p>
<p>The federal government&rsquo;s policy on employment equity states that the goal is to &#8220;ensure that designated group members achieve equitable representation within the public service.&#8221; The policy also says that hiring should respect the Charter of Rights and Freedoms which states that &#8220;every individual is equal before and under the law,&#8221; but also contains a clause allowing for affirmative action programs.</p>
<p>Some prominent Conservative MPs, including Indian Affairs Minister Chuck Strahl, have spoken out against this kind of discriminatory hiring practice in the past. In 2005, then public works minister Liberal Scott Brison called his department to task for issuing a memo stating that only certain groups would be hired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I support the whole policy of inclusion, but I do not support discriminating against any group in hiring practice,&#8221; Brison said at the time.<br>

		<p>It is almost that way here in the US. There was an article here on Amren that said that blacks were overrepresented (based on their percentage of the population) by some 300%. From what I have seen it is almost impossible for a White woman (let alone a White man) to get a state or government job. Here in Utah there are not that many blacks so most of these positions are held by Hispanics. Go to any DMV and you will see what I mean- impossibly long lines and as employees sitting around doing nothing. </p>

<p>Is Mrs. Landriault truly so naive as to be surprised at being the victim of anti-White racism?  Has she not had her eyes and ears open for the past fifty years?</p>
<p>Canada, like the United States, has an official policy of hating the very people who built it.  Eh.  Apparently, it takes a flagrant incident such as this one to shock the masses out of their television-induced hypnosis.</p>

<p>Where was Sara Landriault when this legislation was being debated and enacted into law?  I&rsquo;ll tell you   &mdash;   she was doing what most middle-class whites did   &mdash;   insulating herself from the problem, moving to the suburbs, watching the Cosby Show, pretending that race didn&rsquo;t exist and if anyone dared to raise any objections, she called that person a racist.  And now she cries foul.  I have absolutely no sympathy for people who instead of educating themselves were too busy agonizing over the fate of a professional sports team or the latest twist in a television sitcom.</p>

		<p>Better late than never on having your eyes opened. There are so many of us here on Amren who were once like you said- fans of professional sports teams, followers of American Idiot and other pulp television shows and concerned more with with living a middle class lifestyle until one day it happened&hellip; You are continually denied promotions at work, your kid doesnt get into the college they dreamed about or you get called on the carpet for &#8220;offending&#8221; a minority coworker where no offense was meant on your part. Possibly it could be even worse- you are a victim of an anti White hate crime and nobody listens. As soon as you see the truth about race you can never go back to your comfortable life- you see the glaring anti White propaganda out there and know something has to be done but it seems like your hands are tied. I will say that if this lady had the same situation happen here in the US she would have grounds for a lawsuit. </p>

<p>Two things:</p>
<p>1) Name me a place, it doesn&rsquo;t matter where on this globe, with more than 10.000 people which is majority black but wealthy. Name me one.<br>
You will not find one place on this earth. Is this by accident so?<br>
It is a fact that everyone can say whether a place is wealthy and secure or pure and dangerous without knowing anything about this place but its color. There is no place on this earth where blacks are more wealthy than whites. Either there are whites and are wealthy ones or there aren&rsquo;t any whites and all people are poor.<br>
This all is fact! And people who are ignoring this fact are constantly calling us to be ignorants. No matter where Europeans are in big numbers it looks like Europe and no matter where blacks are in big numbers it looks like Africa.</p>
<p>2) So you were 14 years old. You couldn&rsquo;t do anything. But now you can. You know what will happen. You have been warned. You have seen what happened to one of the richest country of Africa, white Rhodesia, after it got black. Here is a videohttps://tinyurl.com/2uwmoaq<br>
You have seen what happened to South Africa after the number of blacks got bigger and bigger. Here are some pictures: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/348sz2j" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/348sz2j</a><br>
You have seen what happens in France, what happens in Sweden and what happens in Detroit and LA. In all this places whites have to flee. Nobody can blame YOU for that but your children can blame you for not doing anything now. For still calling race realists and people who don&rsquo;t ignore facts, &#8220;haters&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Hmm, by definition an aboriginal is an original native of an area, which in Canada would mean Canadian Indians. Through usage the term has come to mean primitive to many listeners.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to learn that the Canadian usage means anybody of color (red or black).  In other words, anybody not of white European stock.</p>

<p>The law was passed by Brian Mulroney and his &#8220;Conservative&#8221; party. Canadians were (and still are) naive enough to think that if they vote for &#8220;Conservatives&#8221; they&rsquo;ll get conservative policies. </p>

		<p>I got a good civil service job in 1966 right after I finished college.  6 years later, 1972 the no Whites need apply laws arrived.  I have fought the anti White laws all my life and I have lost.</p>
<p>All I can recommend for Whites is to change their children&rsquo;s last names to hispanic ones when they enter high school.  They won&rsquo;t even have to apply for college, the colleges will send then the admissions packets along with a letter begging then to apply.  The average White IQ combined with a hispanic last name guarantees a scholarship to the college of their choice.</p>
<p>By the second semester of Junior year your hispanic named children will be getting letters from every government agency and large employer around begging them to work for them.</p>
<p>Read the history of English Catholics.  </p>
<p>From about 1533 to 1832 they were forbidden by law to work at virtually every job but acting and begging.  So they went underground, sent their children to school or travel in Catholic countries to learn about the faith. By going to Church of England services by day and secret Catholic services by night they managed to earn a living, prevent the confiscation of their property and keep the Roman faith.</p>
<p>And when Roman Catholicism was legalized in 1832 one quarter of the population turned out to be Catholic.</p>
<p>The early modern English CAtholics realized they could not fight the discrimination.  So they went underground.</p>
<p>There is literally nothing we can do but take hispanic names.</p>
<p>I doubt that our anti White government will content itself with just employment, contracting and educational discrimination.</p>
<p>Remember what Hitler&rsquo;s very first move against the Jews was in April 1933.  He issued an order that no Jews were to be hired for government positions;that no government contracts were to be given to Jews and that government employee health insurance not be used for Jewish medical providers.  </p>
<p>For various reasons, basically Russian communist penetration of our press, government, media and academia since the 1920&rsquo;s, we Whites are destined for extinction.</p>

		<p>Hi Sara. We AmRenners have seen case after case of anti-white discrimination for many years. For many of us that is what motivates us to support AmRen. We do it as a way of helping other whites as well as stopping it from happening to ourselves someday. If you were not aware that this discrimination was happening, or if you didn&rsquo;t know about AmRen, then you should question why your usual sources of information haven&rsquo;t told you. For sure, the mainstream media under-report these cases. The MSM certainly knows of AmRen but prefers that you do not. </p>

		<p>Most Canadian Indians live voluntarily  on reserves way up north and thus cannot get jobs in Ottawa or other big cities. Blacks in turn are highly overrepresented in jails and thus one cannot expect them to have their share of government jobs. If one adds education to the discussion, blacks and Indians are on average below minimum requirements. </p>

		<p>#6 Sara Landriault - <i>&#8220;Get over the hate and do something about the discrimination, no matter what race they block it is all wrong!&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The words &#8220;hate&#8221; and &#8220;racist&#8221; are so carelessly overused and misrepresented in today&rsquo;s vocabulary that these expressions have essentially lost their intended meanings, and instead have become &#8220;weapons of war&#8221; used against white people and the white race only!</p>
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;re trying to be all inclusive when you state &#8220;<i>no matter what race</i>&#8221;. That&rsquo;s often a side-step used by white people indoctrinated with white-guilt who&rsquo;re trying not to appear &#8220;racist&#8221; whenever broaching this subject matter.</p>
<p>Based on the discriminating rules of &#8220;employment-equity&#8221; (affirmative action) and your personal experience, you should be convinced that it&rsquo;s your own race that is exclusively under fire here. You&rsquo;re neither the first, nor the last White Canadian targeted under these Marxist rulings.  </p>
<p>Prior to mass 3rd world immigration beginning in the 1970s, White Canadians were not subjected to 2nd tier position because we were essentially a homogeneous country that&rsquo;s now reduced to 84% white, and dropping fast. </p>
<p>Check out most Canadian government offices, including <i>Citizenship and Immigration Canada</i>, and you&rsquo;ll find NON-white immigrants working at jobs that &#8220;Canadians refuse to do&#8221;. </p>
<p>In the past twenty years alone, we had some 5 million visible-minority immigrants enter our country of only 34 million, and given special privileges at the expense of their white hosts. Are you able to envision the outcome of this encroaching scenario? Sitting on your hands and trying to play fair will not win favours with your adversaries who are hoping to beat you in this game&hellip;. and you lost the first round.</p>
<p>Just recently, here at AmRen, <a href="/news/2010/06/is_burlington_t.html#comments" rel="nofollow">another Canadian story</a> was highlighted where the city of Burlington, Ontario was chastised by some &#8220;Black&#8221; committee for being TOO white! </p>
<p>I can only ask &#8220;whose country is this&#8221;?  </p>

Then that very plainly tells us they have lost their country. It is no longer under the control of those people (who built it), despite superficial appearances such as politicians who are out front in the public eye. But those are just fronts,  not the new elite who are now in control, setting the agenda, and pulling the strings.</p>

		<p>We should not be blaming Sara Landriault and piling on her this way. She is a victim and and one of ours, and ought to be on our side. </p>
<p>I believe that Anon.#4 wrote  his criticim of &#8220;Sara Landriault&#8221; as a GENERIC criticim of most white, comfortable, middle class persons who don&rsquo;t want to know what&rsquo;s going on until it suddenly affects them.  As such, it&rsquo;s valid. But he could not have meant it personally.  Sara, don&rsquo;t take it personally.</p>

		<p>7@German we do have countries such as Botswana, Bermuda and Barbados. And to expand the non-white gene pool a bit further we also have the United Arab Emirates,Kuwait, Qatar,Singapore, China, Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan, Bahrain and so on&hellip;..To be fair there are also such &#8220;White&#8221; economic starlets as Bosnia-Herzegovina, Greece, Serbia, Macedonia, Albania, Belarus, Ukraine,Romania, ETC&hellip;its a matter of perspective i suppose&hellip;..  </p>
