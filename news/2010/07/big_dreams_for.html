<h1>Big Dreams for &#8216;Little Ethiopia&rsquo; Dashed</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Natalie Stechyson, Globe and Mail (Toronto), July 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the soft tones of his traditional Amharic language, Samuel Getachew orders lunch  &mdash;  flatbread and a minced-beef dish  &mdash;  from the waitress at Wazema Restaurant.</p>
<p>He gazes out the window of the Ethiopian eatery at the shops and restaurants lining the intersection of Danforth and Greenwood avenues as he waits for his meal.</p>
<p>&#8220;We say Toronto is diverse,&#8221; he said with a flip of his hand. &#8220;But we don&rsquo;t even have an area named after an African country in the entire city.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toronto, a place where half of the population was born outside of Canada, is sometimes called a city of neighbourhoods. Italian, Greek, Korean, South-Asian, Chinese and Portuguese people all have pockets of town to call their own. Even Malta  &mdash;  a small island country off the coast of Italy  &mdash;  has a few blocks named after it in the Junction.</p>
<p>Mr. Getachew, 33, has been fighting the biggest Business Improvement Association in the city for more than a year to designate four blocks for Ethiopians. He has met with city councillors and the mayor to no avail. He&rsquo;s collected nearly 600 signatures on a petition he started in January. He&rsquo;s even running for city council this year to gain support for a so-called Little Ethiopia, which he proposes would stretch from Greenwood Avenue to Monarch Park.</p>
<p>At this point, he&rsquo;d settle for a street sign, he said. Anything to give Toronto&rsquo;s approximately 11,000 Ethiopians a sense of place.</p>
<p>The Danforth-Mosaic BIA says that place is not at Danforth and Greenwood. Patricia Silver, the executive director, insists it would be unfair to rebrand the 500 multicultural businesses in the Danforth-Mosaic under a single country. She said it is important to honour all the businesses in the BIA.</p>
<p>There are 11 Ethiopian restaurants in the area that Mr. Getachew is proposing to rename. There are also a number of other ethnic eateries: four of them Moroccan; one Spanish; one Middle Eastern; seven Italian; 25 Asian; five Greek; and one Irish pub.</p>
<p>Like the name suggests, the area is a mosaic. And in keeping with that idea, one country cannot stand out.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not little anything,&#8221; Ms. Silver said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s grand everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>In order to rename an area, or even get a street sign, an area&rsquo;s BIA must approve the proposal and recommend it to city council. Usually, the neighbourhood has one predominant culture. Ms. Silver said Mr. Getachew&rsquo;s heart is in the right place, but the BIA will never vote to turn such a multicultural neighbourhood into Little Ethiopia.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can walk the whole world in our four kilometres, and we think that other areas in Toronto really can&rsquo;t offer that.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Kiru, the executive director in charge of Toronto&rsquo;s 68 BIAs, agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he&rsquo;s pushing up-river here,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In Wazema Restaurant, Mr. Getachew and his friend, Tewobros Kassa, tear off strips of sticky Ethiopian flatbread and scoop spiced minced beef and lentils from the platter in front of them.</p>
<p>Mr. Kassa, who has lived in Canada for 21 years, said he&rsquo;s been wishing for a Little Ethiopia since he was a young boy. He can vividly recall driving into Los Angeles on vacation and seeing a sign for Little Ethiopia on the highway.</p>
<p>&#8220;You feel like you&rsquo;re home,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Getachew said feeling at home is something worth fighting for.<br>

		<p>The founders of Canadian multiculturalism wished it to evolve into &#8216;the Canadian Mosaic&rsquo;, a counterpart to the United States&rsquo; &#8216;melting pot&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The &#8216;mosaic&rsquo; was intended to be more of a state of mind than a physical reality. It was thought that second generation immigrants would disolve and mix like Irish, German and Scots, downplaying their ethnic roots for loyalty to Canada.</p>
<p>Forty years later, the ethnicities instead want more autonomy. The Chinese have begun flexing their dormant cultural muscles, and blacks and Arabs have reached the critical mass that they are splintering into Somali, Ethiopian, and other factions true to their tribal and national origins. </p>
<p>If anyone is to blame for Canada&rsquo;s contemporary weak identity, it is the cabal of white leftists who forced &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo; onto white Canada back in the late 1960&rsquo;s. </p>

		<p>If he and other Ethiopians want to &#8220;feel at home&#8221;, they can go back to Ethiopia and feel downright homey, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>As for Toronto, &#8220;Little Ethiopia&#8221; my butt.  The entire city should be renamed &#8220;Little Balkans&#8221;, because that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s going to be like one day soon.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s only one place in the world for Mr. Kassa, and that is &#8220;home&#8221; in Ethiopia, not Canada, as his own words suggest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Invited strangers  can never be more than guests in [our Canadian] home; and when they are not invited you will quite properly feel yourself to be invaded, whatever their own ideas about &lsquo;belonging&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The fact that uninvited immigrants much prefer living conditions here is quite understandable; but that doesn&rsquo;t make them genuine citizens any more than squatters can be called residents.&#8221; </p>

<p>Your wishing days could be over &#8220;Mr. Kassa&#8221;. Just board a plane for Ethiopia and you will again feel at home again. Be sure to take your whole family with you so they can also experience the joy.</p>
<p>Mr. Getachew said feeling at home is something worth fighting for.</p>
<p>Where was this fighting spirit when he was in Ethiopia? Isn&rsquo;t it interesting that they suddenly get in the fighting spirit once they come here, but somehow couldn&rsquo;t muster it up when living in their native countries.</p>

		<p>There is already a place for Ethiopians.  It is much larger than Toronto.</p>
<p>It is even already named &#8220;Ethiopia&#8221;, and officially recognized as such, so these folks really have no reason to worry about having a place bearing the name &#8220;Ethiopia&#8221;, where they may hear the &#8220;soft tones&#8221; of their traditional language, enjoy their native cuisine, and feel completely at home. </p>

		<p>First, they want to get out of their country.  They want to come into your country and live among you.</p>
<p>Then, once they&rsquo;re there, they want to name a piece of your country for their country   &mdash;   the country that they wanted to get away from.</p>
<p>I have a simpler solution. Go back to the place they came from where it&rsquo;s already named &#8220;Ethiopia&#8221;.  No changes necessary. No problem!</p>

		<p>Had a gf who lived in Li&rsquo;ll Ethiopia, also known as &#8216;the Parkdale of East York&rsquo; and I can vouch for that name because I lived in Parkdale too. Pimps, prostitutes &amp; drug addicts grace the streets, except in Li&rsquo;ll Ethiopia, it&rsquo;s Ethiopians and not Tibetans as the local 3rd World sample. But I concede that the Ethiopians are relatively civilized compared to other blacks, especially their Somali cousins.</p>

<p>I know the Danforth/Greenwood area of Toronto quite well, and I would never have guessed it was a Little Ethiopia   &mdash;   either officially or unofficially. </p>
<p>The area was traditionally Mediterranean (Greek, Italian) but is now filling up with South Asian Muslims (Pakistani, Bangladeshi). There is a HUGE new mosque there; as well as a 7-11 store full of &#8220;halal&#8221; products, women in burqas, and Muslim teenagers who combine traditional Pakistani ankle-length prayer pajamas and crocheted skullcaps with expensive hip-hop sneakers and Tupac Shakur T-shirts, making them look like gangsta-rapping ayatollahs. (You see this look a lot in European cities, too   &mdash;   especially in areas where cars are on fire.) </p>
<p>Ethiopians around Danforth/Greenwood? Not that I&rsquo;ve noticed. Certainly not enough to warrant a street sign or an official designation from City Hall. </p>
<p>Not that I agree with making such divisive ethnic designations official anyway, as they have an ghettoizing effect on immigrants that prevents assimilation. </p>
<p>I do know of one section of Toronto with a significant infestation of Ethiopians, but it is many miles away, on Bloor West. But that area is not called &#8220;Little Ethiopia&#8221; either. Locals are more likely to refer to THAT neighborhood as &#8220;Cracktown.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Perhaps the authorities would feel better about themselves if they renamed it Global Village. That way, all nationalities and ethnicities would be included, the elites could pat themselves on the back for being so open minded, and no matter how the demographics changed, the name would still be accurate.</p>

		<p>Odd. It sounds ALMOST as if the various groups in this multicultural city are divided into factions competing for attentions from government. Is that what they mean by &#8220;mosaic&#8221;? </p>

		<p>Some commenters suggest the Ethiopian spokesman go back to Ethiopia to feel at home.  That&rsquo;s missing the point.</p>
<p>Ethiopia, like a lot of other Third World countries, is enjoying having a colony in the white, Western, industrialized world.</p>
<p>Rather than wanting to go home, Third World people are motivated by dreams of growing their colonies into places where they can reinforce their national identity, practice their customs, accrue political power, and bestow riches back to the homeland.</p>
<p>This is 21st century colonialism. </p>

		<p>Slightly off-topic, but related to Ethiopia : Below is another in a series of my letters to the quacks at the New York Times, this one in response to NYT reporter Trymaine Lee&rsquo;s article entitled &#8220;Harlem Church Links With Ethiopian Coffee Growers&#8221; (link is included in body of letter), published yesterday in that most despicable of multi-cult propaganda rags: </p>
<p>&hellip;/&hellip;</p>
<p>Dear Reporter Lee : </p>
<p>If you are working for the New York Times, and are of african descent, the chances are very high that you are an Affirmative Action hire. Correct? </p>
<p>Nevertheless, you are probably intelligent enough to understand that a significant percentage of the Times&rsquo; readership will be racially aware enough to see through the usual Times minority-uplift propaganda, and know - as per your article published today - that any all-black American group raising money for any all-black concern in Mother Africa is going to have a very high probability of : </p>
<p>- Failure<br>
- Corruption. </p>
<p>That is why your article entitled &#8220;Harlem Helps Raise Coffee in Ethiopia&#8221; is utterly laughable from a race-realism point of view. </p>
<p>In case you haven&rsquo;t noticed, race realism is gaining ground in the Western World, despite over 45 years of a concerted effort to suppress it and to turn reality upside-down. </p>
<p>Even such mainstream drivel pravdadian propaganda rags as Newsweek are now reporting openly about race and IQ (though of course the conclusions they draw are 100% PC pre-approved).</p>
<p>&hellip;/&hellip;</p>
<p>I could not help but cringe at a few of the zingers in your rather silly article. You quote some idiot who claims that &#8220;&hellip;And because of what Africa has given the world, and for what they stand for, we must give back.&#8221; </p>
<p>Excuse me? What Africa has given the world? Do you means AIDS, necklacing, and baby rape? (Please see this very insightful - and, alas, career-crushing - article from Irish Times columnist Kevin Myers) : </p>
<p>http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/kevin-myers/africa-is-giving-nothing-to-anyone  &mdash;  apart-from-aids-1430428.html</p>
<p>And: We must give back to Africa? Give WHAT back to Africa? As it is, white people, who comprise only 8% of the world&rsquo;s population (as opposed to 33% in 1950), provide 95% of all financial and other aid to Africa. </p>
<p>We give them aid, they give us AIDS. </p>
<p>Another zinger from your article : &#8220;Most of the people doing development work in Africa are not of African descent.&#8221; </p>
<p>Duuuhhh. Big surprise there. In Haiti alone, even before the earthquake, there were over 10,000 charitable organizations, 98% of which were White operated, and White-Western guilt financed. </p>
<p>Do you not see a pattern here? </p>
<p>&hellip;/&hellip;</p>
<p>I wish the organization that you reported on the best of luck. But being a realist, I see failure and corruption in their immediate future. You would have been a better journalist if you had addressed in your article the issues I address in this email. </p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>- Arturo de Geaubineaux  </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t get it. You say they&rsquo;re not really Canadian, and they complain about how &#8220;racist&#8221; you are. Then, they turn around and complain about how it doesn&rsquo;t feel &#8220;Ethiopian&#8221; enough, in TORONTO! Make up your minds. Are you Canadian, or Ethiopian?
