			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), July 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A school where 60 per cent of pupils speak English as a second language has invested in electronic translators for every child so they can communicate with teachers.</p>
<p>Manor Park Primary in Aston, Birmingham, which has 384 pupils of 32 different ethnicities, is the first school in Britain to provide translators for all of its children and to make the tools an integral part of every lesson.</p>
<p>The technology enables teachers to type messages to pupils which are then translated into the 19 native tongues of children with no English.</p>
<p>Another 11 languages are spoken by pupils who have some English.</p>
<p>And with figures showing that one in six primary pupils speaks a different language at home  &mdash;  double the number ten years ago  &mdash;  the technology could soon become a permanent feature in many more schools.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Talking Tutor&rsquo; can verbally translate English into 25 languages including Polish, Urdu, Pakistani and Chinese. A further 200 languages can be translated on-screen.</p>
<p>Teachers type a message into a computer and the virtual tutor then reads the message out to the pupil in their native tongue. The pupil types a response which is read to the teacher by the tutor.</p>
<p>The software claims to be 95 per cent accurate as it uses &rsquo; contextchecking technology&rsquo; which gives the meaning of the message rather than a verbatim translation.</p>
<p>Headmaster Jason Smith said the software had transformed his school and given staff the opportunity to communicate with children.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have a very diverse school  &mdash;  at any one time there are upwards of 30 different languages,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have always found this the biggest barrier to integrating a child into the school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The school pays £700 a year for the software, which comes with onteacher-screen &#8216;avatars&rsquo;, or characters, based on the background of the pupils.</p>
<p>These include an Asian man, a white Eastern European and a black African man. Plans are also in the pipeline to include a Chinese woman and a burka-wearing Muslim.</p>
<p>The software, developed by Lincoln-based EMAS UK, cost more than £2.5million to produce.</p>
<p>Dawn Holt, a teacher at the school, admitted she had struggled in the past to communicate with pupils who had recently arrived in Britain.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;You could never have a who could speak all those languages, so I think this technology is probably here to stay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But critics say that giving pupils computerised translators could be &#8216;damaging and dangerous&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Nick Seaton, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: &#8216;Surely it would be better to give all these foreign-speaking youngsters an intensive course in English.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There were mixed reactions to the translator last night from parents of Manor Park pupils.</p>
<p>One father of two, who did not want to be named, said: &#8216;My boys say teachers are spending more time using the computer than teaching.</p>
<p>&#8216;They came home last week and said they felt pushed aside. The teachers are neglecting the English kids.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But another parent, Carol Barnes, 45, was in favour. She said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s another way they can teach the kids and it&rsquo;s also a way of getting non-English-speaking pupils to communicate with English speakers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Latest figures from the Department for Education show that 905,610 children do not speak English as their first language.</p>
<p>This figure has risen by 42,750 in a year, and accounts for 16 per cent of pupils in primary schools and 11.6 per cent in secondaries.</p>

		<p>&#8220;(my children) came home last week and said they felt pushed aside. The teachers are neglecting the English kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>I heard the same complaint from a parent in Canada over ten years ago. The teachers spend so much time on the immigrants, they have little left for white children who want to learn.</p>
<p>White flight to private schools is the result.</p>

		<p>I like how they have included &#8220;Welsh&#8221; as a first language.  Precisely 0% of all Welsh children will not speak English. </p>
<p>Also, is Patois really a language?</p>

		<p>What is happening in the schools in Great Britain is similar to the integration at gunpoint that occurred in the US 35 - 40 years ago. This is worse in many ways because at least the blacks and the whites in most of the US at that time had more in common than an Englishman and someone from the Middle East or India. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if home schooling is legal in GB, but you may want to consider it. There is a case in Tennessee right now of a German family who has requested political asylum in the US over the issue of home schooling. Home schooling is illegal in Germany and this family fears that their children will be taken away if forced to return. Needless to say, this is something of a political hot potato. These are the types of immigrants we need, not people with room temperature IQ&rsquo;s who have a worldview that is consistent with that of Saudi Arabia in 700 AD.  </p>
<p>From &#8220;The Rise of the Meritocracy&#8221; by Michael Young -  &#8220;As Sir Hartley Shawcross said in 1956 - I do not know a single member of the Labour party, who can afford to do so, who does not send his children to a public school, often at great sacrifice, not for snobbish reasons, or to perpetuate class distinction, but to ensure his children get the best.&#8221; </p>
<p>(Public School in GB has the same connotation as a private school in the US). </p>

		<p>IMO, this is a mistake for one simple reason:</p>
<p>Say you want to have a will made.  Or buy/sell a house.  Or get a tooth pulled.</p>
<p>The very adult professional class you -may- create from this waste of time (I know I certainly cannot type as fast as I talk, though just sometimes the latter is former is clearer in it&rsquo;s projected intent) and mishmash of cultures is going to either have to have a supporting population to justify their own existence.</p>
<p>Or whites will have to bite the bullet and do business with those who, at this point, they cannot even -talk to-, as equals.</p>
<p>And how likely is either one of those conditions?</p>
<p>Furthermore, I see at least three combinations of languages whose parent cultures are conflicted with each other.  And since these students are NOT being &#8216;deprogrammed&rsquo; by a process of Anglicization; there is every reason to believe that they will retain their home customs and attitudes, as reinforced by the language spoken predominantly at home.</p>
<p>Unless you are setting these poor young fools up for a career in data entry or credit card transactions, you are doing them _no favors_.</p>
<p>While at the same time, by disenfranchising the native indigene culture, you also ruin the existing tiered economic base of the native English who -would- take care of each other as a social network.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that every Englishman that can possibly go expat are all engaged in white flight to -other nations-?  Not only are they forced to &#8216;integrate&rsquo; with unwanted cultures.  But the nature of &#8216;assimilate&rsquo; is indeed Borgian with the invasive people obliterating the economic base of their hosts.</p>
<p>I fear Britain is California made large.</p>
