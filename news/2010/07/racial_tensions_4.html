<h1>Racial Tensions Roil NC School Board; 19 Arrests</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Baker, Google News, July 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Protesters and police scuffled Tuesday at a school board meeting in North Carolina over claims that a new busing system would resegregate schools, roiling racial tensions reminiscent of the 1960s.</p>
<p>Nineteen people were arrested, including the head of state NAACP chapter who was banned from the meeting after a trespassing arrest at a June school board gathering.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After several minutes, Raleigh police intervened and asked them to leave. When they refused, the officers grabbed arms and tried to arrest the protesters. One child was caught in the pushing and shoving, as was school board member Keith Sutton, who was nearly arrested before authorities realized who he was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, hey, ho, ho, resegregation has got to go,&#8221; some protesters chanted.</p>
<p>Sutton, the only black member of the board, said he went into the crowd to try and calm things down and encourage officers not to use such strong force. He said he felt insulted that he almost got arrested and believes the officer who tried to detain him owes him an apology.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Wake County School Board has voted multiple times over the last several months to scrap the district&rsquo;s diversity policy, which distributed students based on socioeconomics and for years had been a model for other districts looking to balance diversity in schools. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At a morning rally that drew 1,000 people, speakers quoted Martin Luther King Jr., remembered the days of segregated water fountains and likened the current situation to the landmark Brown v. Board of Education battle. Barber [the Rev. William Barber] talked about America&rsquo;s legacy of racial strife to galvanize the crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too many prayers were prayed,&#8221; Barber said. &#8220;Too many lives were sacrificed. Too much blood was shed. Too many tears were shed. We can&rsquo;t turn back now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barber&rsquo;s supporters {snip} carried signs that read: &#8220;Segregate equals hate&#8221; and &#8220;History is not a mystery. Separate is always unequal.&#8221;</p>
<p>George Ramsay, a white former student body president of Enloe High School, said it was necessary to keep the diversity policy in place to prepare students for an increasingly connected world.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is shortsighted to ignore the way students like me have been enriched by diversity,&#8221; Ramsay said.<br>

<p>Segregation was ended based on social science and psychology that shamed Whites into acting like they cared if black boys  had hurt feelings because White Girls weren&rsquo;t easy to date.</p>
<p>With resegregation, black boys will once again be inconvienced in their insatiable desire for White Girls.   </p>
<p>What they really mean is that &#8220;Hey, hey, ho, ho, black boyz mo&rsquo; and mo&rsquo;, we won&rsquo;t let the White Girlz go!&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
When will it be declared a Hate Crime against Humanity when White parents send their beautiful and intelligent children to very majority White private schools?</p>

<p>Bzzzt.  Wrong.  We can and we must.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;George Ramsay, a white former student body president of Enloe High School, said it was necessary to keep the diversity policy in place to prepare students for an increasingly connected world.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see, now&hellip;  We can&rsquo;t abandon Diversity because without Diversity we wouldn&rsquo;t be Diverse.  Have I got that right?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The Wake County School Board has voted multiple times over the last several months to scrap the district&rsquo;s diversity policy, which distributed students based on socioeconomics&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>No, it distributed students based on <i>race</i>.  It was explicitly Racist in nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s useless to try reasoning with these people, just as it was useless to try reasoning with the Spanish Inquisition.  Diversity is a religious cult, complete with its own versions of Sin, Sinners, Righteousness and Redemption.  And Guilt, of course. Lots of Guilt. You simply can&rsquo;t reason people out of a religious conviction.<br>

		<p>One of those moments that challenged my whole way of thinking was when a poster commented on segregation under the pen name, One Who Was There. They said, &#8220;Segregation was never about asserting White superiority, it was merely a political restraining order against Black misbehavior&hellip;&#8221; </p>

<p>Any merit in what he said was unintended.</p>
<p>While it might awaken and educate a few whites to race realism, the price is too high.  Whites can learn race realism by other means, at arm&rsquo;s distance from black classroom disruption and integrated prom nights.</p>

		<p>Apparently, the only policy that&rsquo;s changing is busing for the purposes of racial integration.  No doubt, the county is sick and tired of paying for something that&rsquo;s a total fool&rsquo;s errand.  After half a century of mixed classrooms and perks for blacks, the majority of blacks are no more advanced than before.  Add to that the fact that most whites have residentially segregated themselves and send their kids to private schools rather than to class with blacks, so there is little impact made by busing to place a few whites in an otherwise black school.              Most whites have absolutely had it with the silly demands of black activists.</p>

		<p>It has been KNOWN for decades, many of them NOW, that busing to create racial integration in the schoo&rsquo;s as it was done and as it is done ONLY MAKES SEGREGATION WORSE. ONLY exacerbates a situation and creates a lot of animosity.</p>
<p>But it must be continued forever and ever. Even when we know it does not work. Such a mentality.</p>

		<p>Why is it that the blacks who hate whites the most seem to be the most in favor of &#8220;integration?&#8221;  I guess they realize that most whites don&rsquo;t want to be around them.  This just shows that &#8220;civil rights&#8221; have more to do with the hatred of whites than anything else.  Blacks complain constantly about &#8220;whitey&#8221; being &#8220;racist&#8221; but they follow us every where we go.</p>

		<p>Apart from the social challenges presented by busing for the sake of diversity, there are academic challenges, in particular as relates to content.</p>
<p>What is required is degraded, distorted literature and history. A wonderful account of this content is THE LANGUAGE POLICE: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Student Learn (2003) by noted education historian Diane Ravitch.  </p>
<p>Ravitch&rsquo;s description of the bias guidelines for textbook publishing giant McGraw-Hill is illustrative of the comically elaborate sensitivity guidelines ALL publishers must use if they hope to land multi-million dollar sales wth big states and districts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The MH [McGraw-Hill] guidelines express barely concealed rage against people of European ancestry. They deride European Americans for exploiting slaves, migrant workers, and factory labor; they excoriate the land rapacity of the pioneers and mock their so-called courage in fighting Native Americans: &#8216;Bigots and Bigotry,&rsquo; say the guidelines, referring to European Americans, &#8216;must be identified and discussed.&rsquo; European Americans, the guidelines suggest, were uniquely responsible for bigotry and exploitation in all human history &hellip;&#8221;  (p. 44) </p>

<p> So they must also think that &#8220;historically&#8221; black colleges, the congressional black caucus and countless black only associations and clubs equals hate. They separate and segregate don&rsquo;t they?</p>

<p> Oh really George! Then why is it that China owns us? They don&rsquo;t have &#8220;diversity&#8221; They don&rsquo;t seem to be having any trouble connecting to the world. And can you name me one country in all of history that was successful integrating different races, religions and cultures? Seems to me that it&rsquo;s the White countries that embrace &#8220;diversity&#8221; that seem to be going down the drain.</p>
<p> &ldquo;It is shortsighted to ignore the way students like me have been enriched by diversity,&rdquo; Ramsay said.</p>

		<p>I live in a big urban and &#8216;diverse&rsquo; area.  I have to pay 15,000 a year in private school tuition (and it is very difficult to do this) so that my child can have the kind of education I had growing up in a small town in the midwest (which is currently in the beginning stages of being overun by you know who).</p>
<p>What passes for &#8216;educashun&rsquo; in the public schools around here is beyond tears, and all the young, perky white liberals love it, even as they send their own kids to private schools as well.  In many, many schools in this northeast gigantic urban school district, there just aren&rsquo;t any white students anymore.</p>
<p>The only integration that can go on around here is latino/black/arab and asian, and these groups don&rsquo;t give each other the time of day.  Ah, but the racial marxists make NO EFFORT at getting them to integrate, nor do they count such a thing as integration.  It&rsquo;s always mix everyone with euroamericans and that is the only &#8216;diversity&rsquo; they accept as valid.</p>
<p>When we are less than 20-30% of the population, and the other racial groups never integrated (because different ethnic and racial groups never integrate peacefully and by choice) then you will see the break up of the country into various racially based states.  </p>
<p>The grandchildren of today&rsquo;s uber social justice types will be a hunted and persecuted minority in the land created by very wise founding fathers who could never imagine how things would change.</p>

		<p>Years ago on <a href="https://www.kpfa.org/home" rel="nofollow">https://www.kpfa.org/home</a> I heard Gore Vidal say, &#8220;Busing is the liberal&rsquo;s Vietnam.  It is not working.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Affluent white liberals who support busing &#8220;in principle&#8221; are notorious for sending their children to private schools when the alternative is to have them bussed to predominately black public schools.  White liberals who in any way contribute to busing decisions should have their children on the bus.  <br>

		<p>I live in Wake County. I voted for the new school board members who are keeping their campaign promises by returning us to neighborhood schools. </p>
<p>We aren&rsquo;t sick of integration. The population in Wake County has been growing by leaps and bounds. What we are sick of is having new school districts drawn every two years, in an attempt to maintain quotas at schools where the population has changed. We are sick of not knowing what school our child will attend next year. </p>
<p>Most neighborhoods in Raleigh ARE integrated&hellip; there&rsquo;s no evidence that neighborhood schools would be less diverse than they are under the current policy. This is a desperate attempt by the NAACP to appear to remain relevant in a world where they no longer serve any real purpose.</p>

		<p>I wonder how many of these school board members actually have children going to these failing schools? If you still have your kids in government schools and they start talking about busing, redistricting, consolidation or magnet schools then get your kids out! Too many parents make the mistake of telling themselves that they can wait a year to see how things work out. By then it will be too late, your child will have lost a precious year of school work that can never be sucessfully made up. Dont fall for the trick of the &#8220;magnet school&#8221; either. This is a stunt to try to get intellegent and high achieving kids to a poorly performing school to raise test scores. Yes there may be some special programs but would you really want your child on a bus for 2 or more hours a day for a class that you could provide your child or could be had at a closer private school?</p>

		<p>I see segregation as a natural event whereby 2 very disparate groups of people with very different abilities seek their own level in which to exist. If blacks, in fact, have a lower intellectual capacity then they will instinctively seek an environment where they best exist in&hellip;and the same for whites.</p>

		<p>My kids got to play the busing game in Minneapolis during the late 1980&rsquo;s. I don&rsquo;t know if the Black kids got any smarter from sitting in the same class with my kids, but I know that my kids&rsquo; grades went down considerably despite the fact that the schools had been dumbed down to accommodate the Blacks. I tolerated it until Black girls started ganging up on my daughters for being &#8220;racists&#8221; because they turned down the affections of the Black girls&rsquo; brothers and male friends. <br>
I moved my family out to the city of Ramsey in Anoka county, which had all White schools at the time. My kids had to take remedial courses and summer school to overcome the effects of diversity.</p>

<p>As you might guess, they give less than half the interview time to the school board chairman (the policy changer) that they gave to the (grotesquely massive!) local NAACP honcho and a white diversitoid bureaucrat or &#8220;expert&#8221;. </p>
<p>In the case of the latter, the interviewer  &mdash;  apparently a mestiza  &mdash;  asked, ever so earnestly, &#8220;what we&rsquo;re at risk&#8221; of with decreasing integration of public schools, to which he responded predictably. No question which side either of them is on.</p>
<p>It was nauseating.</p>
