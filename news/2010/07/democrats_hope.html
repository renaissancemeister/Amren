			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Cillizza, Washington Post, July 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Four years after Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) lost the white vote by 17 percentage points, Obama lost it by 12, according to exit polls. While the 2008 gains were generally attributed to Obama&rsquo;s strength with young voters  &mdash;  he won by 10 points among whites 18 to 29 years old  &mdash;  he managed to improve on Kerry&rsquo;s showing with white voters across every age demographic.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today. With the November midterm elections less than four months away, Obama&rsquo;s standing among white voters has sunk  &mdash;  leading some party strategists to fret that the president&rsquo;s erosion  &mdash;  and the party&rsquo;s  &mdash;  could adversely affect Democrats&rsquo; chances of holding on to their House and Senate majorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Washington Post-ABC polling, Obama&rsquo;s approval rating among white voters has dropped from better than 60 percent to just above 40 percent. In a June poll, 46 percent of white voters under age 40 approved of how Obama was doing, compared with just 39 percent of whites 65 and older.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One senior strategist, speaking candidly about his concerns on the condition of anonymity, noted that white voters made up 79 percent of the 2006 midterm electorate, while they made up 74 percent of the 2008 vote. If the white percentage returns to its 2006 level, that means there will be 3 million more white voters than if it stayed at its 2008 levels. That scenario, said the source, &#8220;would generate massive losses&#8221; for House and Senate Democrats in November because of Obama&rsquo;s standing with that demographic.</p>
<p>To avoid such losses, the Democratic National Committee has committed to spending tens of millions of dollars to re-create (or come somewhere near re-creating) the 2008 election model, in which Democrats relied heavily on higher-than-normal turnout from young people and strong support from African American and Hispanic voters.</p>

		<p>Whites are despicable.  Why would they have ever supported Obama in the first place?  Why weren&rsquo;t their instincts sharp enough to tell them that what we are getting now that they don&rsquo; like is exactly what they should have expected?</p>
<p>Whites are frighteningly ignorant of  nature that stands before their eyes and speaks its full intent to make them as miserable as possible. </p>
<p>Now that they seem to be awakening, we must ask why they were ever asleep in the first place.  Who put them under some sort of voodoo hex trance and put all these lies in their heads without their ever resisting?</p>
<p>Whites scare me in their capacity for self sabotaging willful idiocy.<br>

		<p>I hope the Dems spend huge on the November elections. It will not matter. The quiet current of unbridled rage at this administration and his &#8216;reign&rsquo; is about to get them tossed out, and not a moment too soon. Even my politicaly clueless white obama voting cohorts are now agitated and angry about taxes, health care, etc. </p>
<p> The only possibility of them saving themselves is the Republicans (the stupid party) getting in the way and interfering with the Dems destruction. Sadly that is a very real possibility. </p>

		<p>I would expect massive losses after two years of bailouts, economic mismanagement, healthcare reform and failure to secure the borders.  I would like to see a veto proof Senate with the Obamarangatang powerless to prevent any legislation from being signed into law.  I want to see the House of Representatives, in the words of Hillary Clinton, run like a plantation again.  I want Congress to demand that Barack Hussein Obama produce his birth certificate under threat, no I mean warning, of impeachment. The only thing I would be worried about is the wrong mix of Republicans being elected which would result in the resurfacing of the bomb, bomb, bomb Iran crowd.</p>

		<p>If the Republicans put up even a moderately acceptable(no &#8220;open borders amnesty&#8221; McCain types) candidate than all the old whites who stayed home last election will be back in full force.</p>
<p>Hell, they might not even have to do that.  Most of the &#8220;old white people&#8221; I&rsquo;ve talked to are so mad that the Republicans could put up anyone at all.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be crazy to vote for the Democrats.  (I also wonder how immigrant businessmen from Hong Kong feel about being lumped in with Samoans.)<br>

		<p>Why does Obama even have a white support higher than 0.01%?<br>
We can expect the Grand Obsolete Party&rsquo;s strategy to just sit back and expect a marginal victory without going on the offensive.</p>
<p>If it smells like a RINO, then I&rsquo;m voting Democrat this fall. </p>
<p>Our work is all uphill. Last week at the airport, I saw a blond haired, blue eyed boy of about 15 wearing a &#8220;Barack an Roll&#8221; tshirt with Obama&rsquo;s face on it. The clueless are in the millions, and the Republicans are among them. </p>

		<p>There is enough people who do not usually vote to form a powerful third party that truly represents the average citizen.  It is never too late to move in that direction.  Hopefully, the forces will re-appear again in the likes of the Founding Fathers to save this country.  It will take alot of work to undo the past mistakes and delusions.  Hopefully, in the near future, the average whites will once again re-gain back their country.  </p>

		<p>I predict that Obama will get re-elected, by a small margin, for a second term in office. The MSM is in his back pocket, and they will push the idea that it would be simply tragic for the nation&rsquo;s &#8220;first black president&#8221; not to be elected for two terms. Obama&rsquo;s second term will be even more uninspiring than his first, perhaps with a major scandal or two, which the MSM will attempt to downplay. After two terms, the American public (but not blacks) will be thoroughly disgusted by the whole thing, and there will never again be a push by whites for another &#8220;black&#8221; president. There will be no need to, as &#8220;tokenism&#8221; will have been achieved, and tokenism and &#8220;feel good&#8221; politics are what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>

		<p>The fact that 40% of any age group supports Obama just nauseates me.  Who are these people?  What do they see in him?  I will never - ever - understand whites supporting any black politician now or ever.  They simply cannot have the interests of whites at the forefront of any issue.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s sickening that his approval rating is still as high as 40% among white voters.  This proves that there are still far too many whites who are liberal or ignorant.  The number should be 30% at the maximum.  This country will disintegrate because of white enablers, not minorities.</p>

		<p>  The Dems can &#8220;hope&#8221; all they want.  They will lose the House, that&rsquo;s a certainty. All we&rsquo;re seeing now from them is a last gasp effort to jam through what ever legislation they can before they&rsquo;re kicked to the curb in November.</p>
