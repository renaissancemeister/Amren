			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jacques Billeaud, Lycos News, July 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona&rsquo;s impending immigration law went before a federal judge for the first time Thursday, and attorneys for both sides sparred over who had the right to enforce immigration law: local officials or the federal government.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton didn&rsquo;t rule on whether to block the law from taking effect July 29, or whether to dismiss the lawsuit, one of seven. Hearings in two other lawsuits  &mdash;  including one filed by the federal government  &mdash;  are set for July 22, and the judge has been careful to give no hints on who she might favor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>John Bouma, an attorney representing the state, argued Arizona shouldn&rsquo;t have to suffer from the country&rsquo;s broken immigration system when it has 15,000 police officers who can arrest illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But allowing Arizona to carry out its own immigration law violates all court decisions that hold that only the federal government can handle immigration, said Stephen Montoya, an attorney for Phoenix police Officer David Salgado, who filed the lawsuit along with the statewide nonprofit group Chicanos Por La Causa.</p>
<p>&#8220;The federal government doesn&rsquo;t want this assistance,&#8221; Montoya said.</p>
<p>More than 25,000 people have donated more than $1.2 million to a fund established in May to help the state pay to defend the law, Gov. Jan Brewer&rsquo;s office said Thursday.</p>
<p>Salgado&rsquo;s attorneys want the judge to block the law before it takes effect, saying it would require an officer to use race as a primary factor in deciding how to enforce it. Supporters insist that officers would not be allowed to question someone based solely on their race.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Brewer told Bolton that the lawsuit should be dismissed because Salgado and the group haven&rsquo;t alleged a real threat of harm from enforcing the new law and instead are basing their claim on speculation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Protesters and supporters of the law gathered outside the courthouse, separated by at least seven Phoenix police officers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 10 feet away, some 30 people opposed to the law held up signs calling for its repeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;We demand an injunction. We demand a federal intervention,&#8221; opponent Sandra Castro of Phoenix, 22, yelled into a bullhorn.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The other challenges to the law were filed by the civil rights organizations, clergy groups, a researcher from Washington and a Tucson police officer.</p>

		<p>Officer Salagdo thinks that he might get fired if he doesn&rsquo;t enforce SB 1070.  So he&rsquo;s on the record as being against a law, which are probably good grounds to fire him.  Therefore, his fear might turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

		<p>If the Federal Government will not do their job, the state will have to.</p>
<p>If the state will not do the job, the people will have to.</p>
<p>The reason why nations have judges, police and laws, is so that the people do not have to take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>It seems that someone has forgotten this basic structure of society.  <br>

		<p>This must be the first time the feds have not wanted locals to assist them in enforcing a law.  I suppose if bin Laden were nabbed by the El Paso PD, Homeland Security would not want to be bothered!  <br>
No cop honestly believes that he will be forced to enforce any law on the books.  Cops on the beat use discretion in making arrests, and homicide detectives sometimes ignore drug offenses in seeking info on murders.  And what does race have to do with it other than the fact that most of the illegals are Hispanics?  If someone is stopped for a traffic violation and he can&rsquo;t speak English, I would say that&rsquo;s good reason to suspect illegality.  If he has no license or other form of ID and has a thick accent, that&rsquo;s another.  If a cop stopped an old white woman like me and I had a pronounced British accent and no documentation to show citizenship or green-card status, then the cop would have reasonable suspicion.  The fact is that cops already use race and a number of other factors in establishing that crime might be afoot.  White people cruising slowly through ghettos might indicate drug seeking, and cops legitimately stop, question, and search them.  I saw one instance on TV where even wearing cotton gloves while bike-riding was indication that a crook was avoiding fingerprints on stolen merchandise!</p>

		<p>The  Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that the attorney Montoya stated, &#8220;Even though the state of Arizona believes Congress is not very competent and is inept,the state of Arizona has to live with the laws of Congress&#8221;.  The article also states that Federal courts have held that states cannot create their own immigration polices.  John Bouma a lawyer for Gov. Brewer,  the state wants only to help the federal government do what has so far been unable to do:Secure the border  .Its like the federal government is stopping people from taking an interest in their own community to make it better.  Why would the federal government use our tax money to fight against the people trying to support them in enforcing the law.</p>

		<p>The federal government works in mysterious ways. One moment it is forgoing its duties, the next it is defending its right to do them. Wait, make that: The federal government works in transparent ways. Why do we put up with it? I&rsquo;ve been wondering for some time now. The answer I have found:  the answer is a core part of white morality (and a proper Germanic part at that): Do not fight your betters, accept your place; a man must serve his king.</p>
<p>You see it every time a white gives honor to the position of &#8220;President&#8221;. It is part of the nobility of the European, particularly Germanic, people. Problem is, even when there is a black or other in that position, the people bow to the king. This is how Egypt fell, how Greece and Rome fell! It would be well, if we had a noble King&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;but these are not the noble kings of old, tyrants all! Our kind never followed blindly behind evil, they destroyed it. Subservience to nobility does not extend to the destruction of the commonwealth, as such a force could never be noble! We MUST take back our honor from these interlopers, many of whom aren&rsquo;t even from our stock.</p>

		<p>I remember from long ago classes that a class of plaintiffs can appeal to the court to issue a writ of mandamus, basically an order to enforce the law.  Do the feds wish to see a writ coming at them everytime the set an illegal free in America?  The Obama crowd is on very shaky ground.  The latino protesters are merely co=ethnics demonstrating why they are a poor fit in our country. </p>

		<p>I think (and Thomas Woods agrees) that this case could very well manifest itself in the first use of a State&rsquo;s &#8216;Nullification&rsquo; right since the 1860&rsquo;s.</p>
