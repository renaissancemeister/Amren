<h1>USDA Official Resigns Amid Race Controversy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Golis, Yahoo! News, July 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An employee of the Department of Agriculture has resigned, after conservative media outlets posted video Monday of her describing a time in the past when she hadn&rsquo;t used the &#8220;full force&#8221; of her abilities to help a farmer because he was white.</p>
<p>In the video, Shirley Sherrod, who is black, recounts having been asked to help a white farmer avoid foreclosure. She says she was torn over how much to help him because so many black farmers were also struggling, and decided to do just enough to be able to say she&rsquo;d tried:</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t give him the full force of what I could do. I did enough.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So I took him to a white lawyer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So I figured if I would take him to one of them, his own kind would take care of him.</p>
<p>Sherrod spoke to CNN on Tuesday, explaining that she told the story of her actions  &mdash;  which, she said, occurred 24 years ago when she was working for a nonprofit, not the USDA  &mdash;  to illustrate how she has since realized that everything is not about race but &#8220;about those who have versus those who do not have.&#8221; She says she later became friends with the farmer and his wife.</p>
<p>{snip} She told CNN that she tried to explain to USDA officials that the incident was in the past, but said &#8220;for some reason, the stuff Fox and the tea party does is scaring the administration.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>NAACP CEO Ben Jealous was also quick to condemn Sherrod&rsquo;s actions, though. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In response, Sherrod told CNN that it was &#8220;unfortunate that the NAACP would make a statement without even checking to see what happened. This was 24 years ago, and I&rsquo;m telling a story to try to unite people.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There is a theory that President Obama actually did the firing.  If so, I think I know why   &mdash;   She actually sent a white man to a white Federal bureaucrat for assistance, which he probably got.  Can&rsquo;t let whites start thinking that white Federal faces can help them get Federal money or other consideration.</p>

		<p>Glenn Beck was spinning her as a victim today.  Maybe she was taken out of context and maybe she really was using the racist story about her discriminatory treatment of the White Man as an example of how she acted back in the bad old days of reverse racism.</p>
<p>But when she had her conversion, did she renounce all Diversity Race Privileges that the was &#8220;awarded&#8221; through Affirmative Action?  Did she return the NAACP award that she was given for being a good black racist on the front lines of the &#8220;civil rights struggle for equality and opportunity&#8221;?</p>
<p>Had she ever denounced the NAACP, until today when they threw her under the bus?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t trust any of it.  Some sins are unforgivable, especially the nature disordering sin of allowing blacks to have any power whatsoever over White Humanity.  Her transgression is unforgivable, no matter how &#8220;reformed&#8221; Beck thinks she may have become.   And even then, he admits there is no evidence of her claimed context of racist comments.</p>
<p>But it keeps the NAACP, Obama, and the ongoing racial balkanization of our White Republic on the news and in the minds of White People, so good!  More Race News, Please!</p>
<p>There is no bad race news. Anything that teaching White Humanity that we deserve to be very angry and full of seething resentment is good news, as good as the Gospel, for it is the Gospel of our era.</p>
<p>Transcend African Diversity &amp; Embrace White Humanity!</p>

		<p>You should play the entire tape.  &#8220;I was taken out of context&#8221; is often a very lame excuse, but I think in this case the excuse may have some merit.</p>
<p>She claims she was telling of an event long ago.  Her recorded statement was, she says, her initial view when she met with the white farmer.  Her initial view was changed as she worked with the man and she helped him save his farm.  The farmer&rsquo;s wife backs her up.  Her version could be true.</p>

		<p>Actually, more recent videotape and conversations demonstrate that Shirley Sherrod, (the woman in question) went on provide the farmer in question considerable assistance and in fact, saved the family&rsquo;s farm. She also said that the experience made her realize that it was important to provde assistance to everyone in need regardless of race.  </p>
<p>Earlier today on CNN, several Whites, including one farmer&rsquo;s widow confirmed that it was because of Ms.Sherrod that her family was able to keep the farm. Bill O&rsquo;Reilly on his radio show today backtracked and issued an apology saying that &#8220;he rushed to judgement&#8221; and harshly denounced Andrew Briebart (the man whose website posted selections of the video) for being dishonest. He also urged the Department of Agriculture to rehire Ms.Sherrod. </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that I am the biggest fan of Blacks, but in this case, this lady was screwed over unfairly. She deserves to be rehired.</p>

CNN has been reporting this non-stop.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to do what blacks love to do when they get caught speaking their minds on race; they claim they were misunderstood and this issue is &#8216;nuanced&rsquo;. </p>
<p>&#8216;Nuanced&rsquo; is a code for &#8216;we have a right to say or do anything we want because of real or imagined past injustices&rsquo; (see Rev. Wright).</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m not a fan of Mr. Limbaugh, the MSM never affords conservatives to opporunity to use &#8216;nuance&rsquo; as a defense. Conservatives are condemned and pronouced guilty the second they open their mouths. Anything they say in their defense is seen as backtracking, not &#8216;nuance&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>No, actually she doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be rehired. This is the same type of attitude I got when I dealt with the public health clinics, and from social security when I needed disability assistance. This is the same attitude I get from the IRS office when I have to deal with them. </p>
<p>Not only should this lady not be rehired, the federal government needs to do a wholesale house cleaning at the Department of Social Services, Department of Social Security, the Internal Revenue Service, and probably at the USDA. St Louis County needs to do a wholesale house cleaning at the Department of Health. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve dealt with that attitude often enough: the delays, the minimalist effort, the pretending not to understand, pretending not to know, pretending not to be able to do their job as a white guy dealing with typically black, and female government employees. Good black, and female employees who don&rsquo;t openly display racism, and don&rsquo;t do the minimal effort when dealing with a white client are the exception in my experience, and they are rare exceptions. The problem is both systemic, and institutional at this point. Yes, a small portion of this can be attributed to the lower IQ requirements of affirmative action, and there is some genuine incompetence in government, but the former is more common than the latter, and those folks that are too dim to do the job still need to go too. </p>

		<p>What I don&rsquo;t see anyone discussing is this: prior to the audience having any idea about the (supposedly) positive message of her story, they (NAACP) were laughing and applauding her recount of discriminating against the white man. Further, her description of the white man as being &#8220;superior&#8221; acting, etc., still sounded very hateful to me, not as though she were describing a sentiment she no longer felt. So, the NAACP seemed to enjoy her anti-white story before they knew that it was meant (though I don&rsquo;t actually believe this) to be a story about racial solidarity. It&rsquo;s annoying that no one in the media points this out&hellip;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s do talk about slavery without cherry picking. The word slavery was derived from Slavic. Whites Irish, English, Scottish were sold on the exact same auction blocks as black slaves. Do your homework. If blacks get reparations so should whites.</p>
<p>White slavery to the American Colonies occurred as early as 1630 in Scotland.<br>

Heck, if you don&rsquo;t hate whites enough or support affirmative-action enough, or in the right way, you&rsquo;re considered &#8216;insensitive&rsquo; nowadays, at the very least.</p>

		<p>Question for those of you who think her words were taken out of context:</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re right.  Let&rsquo;s say that this is all an Andrew Breitbart symbolic manipulation, to expose the absurdity of, e.g. the NAACP taking &#8220;provocative signs&#8221; out of context.  Would people like this Shirley Sherrod actively lobby against the firing of the Janitor at IUPUI who was dismissed for reading a ND vs K-People book on campus?  Altruism is a two-way street, you know.</p>

<p>The speech before the NAACP sanctioned event wasn&rsquo;t in the past.  Not only was her speech racist, but it was apparent that she regards whites who go to length to explain something to her are really acting superior.</p>
<p>There was much glee and murmers of approval from the audience when she went through the first part of her story.  It brought to mind the blacks clapping and cheering old Jeremiah when he was damning America and the whites who run this country.</p>
<p>Most blacks are anti-white and most are horribly biased against white people in general, and, of course, the population is comprised of so many crybabies and whiners it&rsquo;s getting more difficult by the day to find one who isn&rsquo;t.<br>

		<p>When I was in the military we had surly incompetent civil servants working in different positions.  I understand they did away with the civil service exam because alot of blacks couldn&rsquo;t pass it.  We had people hired as secretaries for the COs who couldn&rsquo;t type, take shorthand or use a computer.  A civil servant friend of mine said it requires alot of paperwork to terminate one and the process takes so long the military person who filed the complaint will transfer long before it gets reviewed and the case gets dropped after he leaves.  If the next CO wants to terminate the same employee the process then starts over again.  </p>

		<p>Nobody cares how much time passes when a white person is said to be speaking in racist terms.  Why should she get a pass for saying things like &#8220;one of his own kind&#8221; and such?  If I said such a thing in the 70s and tried to run for political office I would catch hell.  Look at Sen Byrd, who clearly did no good for the K except use them to gain votes, yet he was labeled as a racist till he died.  Sorry, but I see no reason to give this woman a pass, particularly after seeing her delivery.  She was obviously playing to the largely black audience for approval and was even giddy when she said she did only the barest minimum because the citizen she was sworn to protect was white.  It was very telling to watch her get tossed under the bus by the White House and the NAACP.  Their knee-jerk reactions are getting faster with less thought.  I don&rsquo;t see how Obama can survive a second term with this kind of back stabbing going on.  She was offered up as a sacrifice and it backfired.<br>

<p>It seems to be you who is doing the nuancing. If you had listened to the entire video, passionate, sincere testimony from the farm families this woman helped and other more recent evidence, you would see that that Ms. Sherrod was explaining how her inital anti-White feelings were wrong and that it was a transformative moment for her. The fact is that she was taken out of context by Briebart and a few others.</p>
<p>She is a decent woman who deserves her job back.</p>

		<p>I think the first video was taken out of context on on purpose. And I also think that this naacp was involved in it, just like Mrs. Sherrod herself. Probably a naacp member sent this part of the video to all the tea party bloggers, just to be sure they would publish it, in order to condemn them afterwards. Probably they searched the whole Naacp archive, in order to find something that could be taken out of context easily. I do think this has been a nice try of the Naacp to show that the tea party people are in fact, racist. </p>

		<p>To me, the important issue here is the double standard of judging past words and actions of blacks vs. whites.  Robert Byrd died at 92 and yet was still pilloried over his long-ago membership in a racist organization.  Strom Thurmond at 100 was still being condemned because he had an out-of-wedlock daughter with a black woman, even though he provided for the child.  (And, of course, the condemnation from the left was not over miscegination or illegitimacy, but over the fact that he was more powerful than the woman.)      </p>

Then a chain of events ensued:  her words were taken out of context for political purposes (which ultimately harms a righteous cause later when discovered); Obama intervened in his usual knee jerk way without finding out the facts for his OWN political purposes to appear &#8220;unbiased&#8221; (remember his previous knee jerk behavior regarding the cop and the professor); the USDA, now owned and ruled by Obama like all the rest of the Federal agencies, complied and fired her.  The result?  Blame is being placed on the outside the MSM media namely BLOGGERS AND INTERNET for &#8220;distorting&#8221; ALL issues, with the call to regulate and restrict free speech among BLOGGERS AND THE INTERNET.  Almost like the whole thing was planned to that end, huh?  </p>

		<p>I love this story because it shows that whites are fighting back for a change. Whether this woman deserved to get fired or not is completely irrelevant to the main issue. This whole thing started off as an attack on the Tea Party, remember? Their self-serving attack backfired on the NAACP and Sherrod got caught in the crossfire. Do I care? No. I can&rsquo;t say that I do. The original charges against the Tea Party are all but forgotten and I call that a tactical victory.</p>
<p>Normally, whites just roll over and beg for forgiveness when they&rsquo;re accused of being racists, but this time somebody actually hit back using the NAACP&rsquo;s own tactics. If this woman was unfairly sacrificed, just add her to the list of innocent victims of Washington hard ball and the simmering race war  &mdash;  most of them white, by the way. Personally, I consider this case a very minor payback for all the innocent whites who have been smeared by these leftists. Like it or not, this is how the game&rsquo;s played. It&rsquo;s a dirty business, but I guess the question boils down to whether you want to win arguments or actually change things. If you want to change things, you have to fight back and this story is a textbook example of how to do it.</p>

		<p>I saw the initial video out take when this story was breaking.  I wondered then about the editing.  It doesn&rsquo;t do us any good to create fiction, it doesn&rsquo;t end up getting results.  But there is a larger issue than who said what, where, and when - and even if the Whites House is over-correcting, exposing a sort of panic and low poll numbers.</p>
<p>The larger issue this case brings to us is the one of just what the NAACP has been up to all these years?  Why did a government official have to give a speech like that to begin with?  Even if she learned her lesson and grasped the class issue, a&rsquo; la Marxist themes, a problem in itself, what we did learn for certain is that we have been hiring and allowing government to appoint people to positions that were bound to practice reverse discrimination.</p>
<p>Let me attempt to illustrate this broadly.  When the New World colonies were established, we were in the late Medieval period/Renaissance periods.  Europeans were being actively captured by North African slave traders, and the Ottoman Turks ran a slave state in the East.  So a few hundred years later, the South is harnessed to a system that had its origin in that period.  I find plenty of historical evidence of the real Southern concern for personal safety because in many areas slaves actually outnumbered whites.  The Southern United States found itself in a situation well illustrated by the old &#8220;Tiger by the tail&#8221; metaphor.  In the modern epic, we have only succeeded in once again creating that situation in the entire country.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how really accurate Sherrod&rsquo;s statement was when she said that &#8220;many black men were killed by white men in Baker County.&#8221;  I am going to assume for now it was a bit of an exaggeration because surely I would have had to sit through a retelling of the Baker County murders many times by now during &#8220;Black History Month.&#8221;  Sherrod looks no more than in her 50s, so this many murders in Baker County would have been as &#8220;celebrated&#8221; as that 15 year old in Mississippi who was killed for whistling at a white woman in 1956.  In fact by then, the numbers of whites killed by blacks was already rising.  My nother worked in Washington DC during the war at the Juvenile Authority.  I remember her recounting of several black on white murders, complete with rapes in the region during the war.  Somehow, these stories fail to generate PBS documentaries.</p>
<p>What all this illustrates is the basic problem with the attempt at a large minority population society.  I don&rsquo;t see it working anywhere.  Lincoln&rsquo;s first impulse was to send freed slaves back to Africa.  I am not sure what changed his mind, perhaps the shabby state of the economy at the end of the war?  But the insinuated fix for decades had been to return blacks to their homes.  We all know about Liberia, etc.  But the failure to do that led to this modern obsession with the idea that American can do the impossible; meld together disparate peoples into one superstate of metling pot races and cultures.  Soviet Russia&rsquo;s try at it lasted 70 years and the reprecussions of that experiement will be a problem for Russia for decades, if not centuries.  Only harsh defensive policy will save Russia from being overwhelmed by third world immigrants.  In this, they may succeed where we will fail because they have the historical will that we lack.</p>
<p>I think the world could be a great place with nations of different peoples and cultures illustrating the spectrum of human possibilities and expressions.  However, what the entire world is missing, or denying because it serves many diverse and immediate desires, is what we at Amren know all too well; Diversity is the enemy of any culture, and it will not preserve any race, but destroy all of them, but especially the best, because the best is always the minority.  Or to put it as a simple metaphor, &#8220;Too many cooks spoil the soup.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NAACP has an agenda, no matter what is made of the Sherrod case.  This issue has at least exposed the sort of discussions that go on at their meetings.  That such a group exists and has been able to force a list of words that another race of people cannot utter in a supposedly free society ought to be just one clue as to their real objectives.</p>

		<p>It seems like her words were taken out of context, but that raises these points:</p>
<p>1.  Libs take right-wingers&rsquo; words OOC all the time.</p>
<p>2.  Even if you want to presume Breitbart perfidy, shouldn&rsquo;t the White House/Obama/Vilsak/NAACP, the &#8220;smartest people in the room,&#8221; &#8220;Messiahs,&#8221; &#8220;The ones we&rsquo;ve all been waiting for,&#8221; have considered the OOC scenario before firing her?</p>
<p>3.  Even most liberals aren&rsquo;t blaming Breitbart.  So it was all an NAACP ploy to maintain their own credibility b/c of their anti-TPM resolution.  But the left is in a bout of internecine warfare, which is fine by me.  Which might have been Breitbart&rsquo;s intention all along.</p>
<p>4.  The NAACP was cheering her while they thought she wasn&rsquo;t a reformed anti-white bigot.  They seemed to be silent when she said she had an epiphany.  That might be Breitbart&rsquo;s point all along.</p>
<p>Do you think the NAACP will pass another anti-white resolution again?  Obama him self said that you have to hit back at critics twice as hard as they hit you, so Breitbart hit back twice as hard again.</p>
<p>The TPM might be vacuous and clueless at times, but in this case, they&rsquo;re accidentally doing the right thing.</p>

		<p>Agree with those who think she deservedly got her job back.  First, her quote was taken out of context.  She was describing something that happened 23 years ago. Finally, she expressed an opinion.  We should all be very, very wary of someone who gets fired for expressing an opinion or viewpoint. She did not DO anything.  She told an anecdote of a viewpoint she once had.  Look, I realize that white people had been severely punished for expressing opinions too.  But if we&rsquo;re going to take a principled stance, they it behooves us all to support this woman.  </p>
<p>Now, personally I do not think it is very professional to be discussing personal opinions or views at work.  But that issue goes to professionalism in the workplace, and should be addressed under the banner of workplace behavior.   </p>

		<p>One more thing I can add to my Post 32:</p>
<p>5.  Even though Ms. Sherrod overcame her anti-white bigotry, you can bet there are a lot of black and Hispanic Federal employee/bureaucrats who haven&rsquo;t.  Eventually, we&rsquo;ll see full-context video of them in action.</p>

		<p>The Obama administration, thru the D of A, stated that they<br>
acted to rapidly in firing Sherrod - that they should have looked<br>
into the facts more thoroughly. Mayb so.</p>
<p>I also think they should look into the facts more thoroughly<br>
before they rehire her and make her the next Rosa Parks and<br>
Nobel Prize nominee.</p>
<p>Case reviews should be done to see how often she did her discriminatory acts. Interview some of her White clients, etc.<br>
to see what pattern of bigotry exists in her work.</p>
<p>I think most would agree that any White under these same circumstances would be &#8220;toast&#8221;.</p>

<p>Actually, it is this sort of foolish, juvenile, dishonest (arguably unethical) behavior by Andrew Breibart and others who are supposedly &#8220;working in the best interests of Whites,&#8221; (that often backfires as we have seen here), that will help Obama win a second term.</p>
<p>You can guarentee that the White house is probably as pleased as punch that Breibart and Fox News have been put on the defensive by this unnecessary and badly miscaculated mess up. It will make them much more aggressive and willing to go forth with their radical agenda.   </p>

		<p>@33.  She didn&rsquo;t &#8220;just&#8221; express an opinion, she outright said that she didn&rsquo;t help someone as much as she could based on his race.  Had she said, &#8220;it was hard but I helped,&#8221; then I could have empathy.  But she didn&rsquo;t.  She said she didn&rsquo;t give her full ability then AFTER the fact decided that was &#8220;sort of&#8221; wrong b/c he was a poor White.  I guess well todo Whites can still be snubbed.  AND she added that it still is about Black and White.  <br>
With the gov taking over health care and Blacks filling gov jobs, this type of thing needs to be punished to the hilt.  I don&rsquo;t fault people for thoughts, or even verbalizing those thoughts, I am angry about her actions and her lack of compunction and the reaction of the crowd cheering her.<br>
A lot upsets me today, but her getting back her job and an apology was like a kick in the gut.  </p>

		<p>The NAACP has the whole video up on its site to see the entire context.  While she did have an &#8220;epiphany&#8221; of sorts, she then continued to rant about Bush.  As if someone like George W. Bush, someone who I describe none too charitably with a two-word phrase, (hint:  one of the words is &#8220;lover&#8221;), kept people like her in a torture gulag for 8 years.  In reality, she was probably bouncing around from Federal job to Federal job during the Bush 43 years.  All this talk about USDA &#8220;discrimination&#8221; revolves around those fake black &#8220;farmer&#8221; lawsuits AR has covered so well.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume Breitbart/Fox perfidy for the sake of discussion.  (I don&rsquo;t   &mdash;   I think someone in the NAACP, through one or more intermediaries, fed Brietbart the hacked up clip for some purpose, either to make the conservamedia look bad, or because they wanted Sherrod fired so that they can seem tolerant after their anti-TPM whining in KC).  Why couldn&rsquo;t the NAACP have phoned Obama and Vilsak right when the &#8220;hacked&#8221; clip came out on Breitbart, and played the whole context to keep her from being fired?  Answer:  They wanted her fired, at first, for one of my two theories.</p>

		<p>It was reported recently that Ms. Sherrod&rsquo;s father was murdered by a White farmer in 1965. Given this information, I can understand why she may have harbored the viewpoints she did about Whites that she did at the time. </p>
<p>I have to honestly say, that If I were Black and my father, mother or loved ones were murdered by someone (especially at that time), I myself, would have reacted the same way. Her abiltiy to forgive and reconcile is quite impressive as far as I am concerned.<br>
 <br>
I agree with those of you who say she is indeed a decent person who did not deserve such treatment.</p>

<p>In all due respect, you argument is nonsense. Let&rsquo;s say the NAACP did send them a tape, they would have done so anonymously. Therefore, Breitbart should have had enough sense to be skeptical of airing such a tape on his website. Moreover, he certainly should have had enough sense to view the entire tape  before doing so! How foolish can one be!</p>
<p>The fact is the Andrew Breitbart&rsquo;s intentions were foolish and the backfired BADLY! Shirley Sherrod is now the flavor of the month.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re assuming that Breitbart got the whole tape at first.  I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>As an aside, there is a new theory that Breitbart was a little careless, got a cut-up recording, put it up w/o thinking about the other context, and the WH overreacted b/c whites are abandoning him like crazy.  PJB sorta advances that one today.  <br>
