			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Teresa Watanabe, Los Angeles Times, July 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Latinos now view immigration as their leading concern along with the economy in what activists say is a major shift most likely driven by controversy over Arizona&rsquo;s tough law against illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Nearly a third of Latinos also believe that racism and prejudice are the central issue in the immigration debate, over national security, job competition and costs of public services for illegal immigrants, according to a national survey released Wednesday.</p>
<p>The poll of 504 Latinos, stratified by region, gender, age, foreign-born status and other factors, was conducted by LatinoMetrics from May 26 to June 8 for the Hispanic Federation and the League of United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC.</p>
<p>The poll found that the vast majority of those surveyed strongly opposed the new Arizona law and strongly supported an immigration policy overhaul providing for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and deportation of felons. Republican Latinos showed similar views on these issues as Democrats and independents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Activists believe that frustration over the immigration issue will unify and galvanize Latinos of all political stripes into voting in November. The poll showed that 80% of those surveyed said they planned to vote in the midterm election and that two-thirds would back candidates who supported an immigration overhaul.</p>
<p>Four in 10 Latinos surveyed said they would not forgive a politician or party who did not work hard enough for change in immigration policy. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The poll results mirror the findings of another new poll of 1,600 Latinos in four states conducted for the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund in June. The results, which will be released next week, also shows immigration topping the list of Latino concerns, according to Arturo Vargas, the group&rsquo;s executive director.</p>
<p>Vargas said that immigration has usually ranked fourth or fifth on the list of Latino concerns, after the economy, education and healthcare. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vargas said he was particularly concerned by poll data suggesting that Arizona-type laws could endanger public safety. About 30% said they would be less likely to report minor crimes, and about 20% said they would be less likely to report major crimes in the face of such laws.</p>

		<p>This is what happens when diversity goes out of control.  We have allowed far too many Hispanics into the country legally and these are the people who will support the pro-amnesty crowd.  The Obama administration is pushing illegal immigraion as a way to get these &#8220;good Americans&#8221; to the polls in November.  That is the reason for the Az. law suit.  Democrats care more about staying in power than they do the country.  After all, if they stay in power they can control the lives of we dumb Americans. White people are giving the country away!  We must stand up and say we do not want to change the culture of the nation.  We should deport all illegals and start bringing in more white people to balance out the minorities already here.  Otherwise, we will be digging the grave of America as we know it. I am not forgiving Republicians for their inaction in this mess, either, but they are not in power now. </p>

		<p>Interesting take on Hispanic entitlements.  What&rsquo;s next?  A demand for amnesty for Hispanic-committed felonies, such as rape, armed robbery, and murder?</p>

		<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s look at these poll results from a direction opposite the LA Times and the Nat. Assn. of Latino Elected whatsits.  70% of Latinos do not think racism and prejudice are the central issues in the immigration debate; 60% of Latinos do not say that they will be unforgiving of pols who don&rsquo;t vote hard to change immigration law; 70% of Latinos said they would not be less likely to report minor crimes; 80% of Latinos said they would not be less likely to report major crimes.  One poll found that most Hispanics favor a &#8220;path to citizenship&#8221; and deportation of felons.  This path, as proposed by both major parties, calls for English proficiency, payments of fines and fees, and a record free of felonies.  Nowhere in this article can I personally see any indication of support for blanket amnesty and open borders.  But apparently the far left wants us to think that&rsquo;s what almost all Hispanics want!</p>

		<p>One thing I have learned very well from working in a town where I&rsquo;m part of a small white minority is that race trumps ALL for every race except whites.</p>
<p>As a consultant I see nearly every non-white manager hire nearly 100% of the same race. That goes for blacks, Indians, Chinese, and hispanics. </p>
<p>To a lesser extent hispanics even break it down to specific countries. I&rsquo;ve seen entire companies where the employees are from Columbia or Cuba, the same country of origin as the owner.</p>
<p>It really disturbs me to see hispanics whom I consider friends defending illegals and blanket amnesty. I&rsquo;ve come to realize they don&rsquo;t identify themselves as Americans but as &#8220;Spanish&#8221; and they want to maintain their own culture not embrace America&rsquo;s. A telling phrase is that both both the words Americanoand white are synonymous with most hispanics.   </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t kid yourself about what &#8220;hispanics&#8221; say. I am an ole White lady too and I have seen and heard these Mexicans far more than I ever wanted to. They are about 99% in favor of amnesty and anyone who believes these lies about the &#8220;fines, free of felonies, English profeciency&#8221; etc. etc. to make them &#8220;wait in line&#8221; while STILL living in our country has got to be very naive that the government will ever enforce their own rules. Look what happened when Reagan gave amnesty! </p>

<p> That is very true. RACE is the most important issue facing White America. Problem is most Whites have been so brainwashed into believing NOTHING should be about race, especially for White people. You are a racist if you are White and are deeply concerned for your own people and their survival. Other races have no such qualms.</p>

		<p>&#8220;40% of Hispanics say they will not forgive a politician who does not work &ldquo;hard enough&rdquo; for amnesty.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words they&rsquo;re telling us that they&rsquo;re here to colonize, not to assimilate as Americans.  They fly their Mex rags in the yards, at work, and they carry them down the street, during protests demanding full citizenship. </p>
<p>They failed to make a success of the narco republic they left, so they brutishly pushed ther way into a foreign land, demanding to be given all the privileges of citizens, while they fail to learn the language and engage in hate mongering while they&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>They despise this country, but they want it as their own, stupidly believing that if they were in control it would remain a first world society, even though mestizos have NEVER ever created a nation that was successful, which, of course, is why they had to sneak across our southern border in the first place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been reported that 50% have high school diplomas which is a blatant lie.  The government itself reports that most Mexicans only go as far as the 6th grade, while a large number of them are illiterate even in their own language.</p>
<p>But it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if every last one of them went through 12 years of school, they still wouldn&rsquo;t have any more people who could qualify for anything but janitors and maids, hospital workers, hod carriers, etc.  As blacks have learned, just showing up for class and learning nothing, because they can&rsquo;t learn, will not qualify them to take the CPA exams.</p>
<p>Like blacks, they&rsquo;re a racist bunch of ingrates that deserve to be deported.  Besides lacking general, overall skills and intelligence, they have no idea whatsoever the seriousness of bringing children into this world that they can&rsquo;t possibly care for.</p>
<p>I wish I had a nickel for everytime I&rsquo;ve heard a second or third generation mestizo who dropped out of high school, complain that they have nothing and the Gringos have everything, and that the situation is as it is because &#8220;Anglos keep down Latinos.&#8221;</p>
<p>And like the blacks, the leaders are mortified that their racial tribesmen live in squalor and have only menial jobs, which they blame&hellip;..not on lack of intelligence, ingenuity, or education&hellip;.but on whitey.  It embarasses them tremendously, so they frantically strive to blame everything but their mestizo kin.  Their leaders say &#8220;We must get rid of the Gringo by any means necessary, and as a last resort we must kill them.&#8221;  And, of course, this is a professor at the University of Texas who is very willing to tell anyone who will listen that the Gringo is a racist and uses racist language, stupidly oblivious to the fact that every one of his utterances reveals that he is an anti-white hater.  And, of course, the University excuses his behavior and vile, anti-white language, some of which could be prosecuted as felonious threats against white people.</p>
<p>So, if 40% of mestizos favor amnesty it is no surprise.  In fact, I firmly believe that the percentage is closer to 80%, but they won&rsquo;t admit to it.<br>

		<p>To all the hard-working, honest Latinos now living illegally in America: I do not want you here.  I do not want you to pay back taxes. I do not care if you learn English. I do not need you for anything. I want you to leave America and go back to your home nation and make it a better place.  By staying here you are killing America.  If that is your goal, congratulations, you are winning. If that is not your goal, it is your effect. In either case, your presence brings us ever closer to the next Mexican-American war.<br>
1-Frank: It would be hard to bring in more white people as all White, non-muslim populations on earth are decreasing, while at the same time the White-majority nations are being inundated with third-world immigration. Nice thought though.<br>
2-John: Crime amnesty will not be demanded. Within majority Hispanic areas, crime against Whites will be seen as justifiable retribution for some ficticious past injustice.  It will be crime-amnesty by default of just not being arrested.<br>
3-OldWhiteLady: Amnesty or not, if they remain and immigration continues apace, America dies.<br>
4-Anonymous/J.P.: Yes, and they all laugh at us for our stupidity.</p>

		<p>These people are poor candidates for citizenship. They don&rsquo;t want to become AMERICAN. They only want to pillage and plunder.<br>
They will retain dual citizenship; they will not support US sports teams. Their actions portray their allegiances. They demand the US relinquish sovereignty - something they would never support at home. We already have the cheapest citizenship in the advanced world. They will not make this a better country with a desireable quality of life.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that USA does not see what is happening!!!&hellip;The average citizen does but the politicians have blinders on&hellip;They don&rsquo;t realize that these Mexicans have no concern for USA. They are not like the immigrants of old who were proud to become American and wanted to contribute to America&hellip;The Mexicans want to establish their own communities, speak their own languages etc&hellip;and that is exactly what they are doing!It is crazy and sad to&hellip;America was once such a great country&hellip;I think the Social Security system needs to be over hauled..You see they need more workers to pay for those that retire. This great Ponzi scheme has to go and this will cut down on this foolish immigration plan of the politicians. I can&rsquo;t believe they are sueing Arizona&hellip;This immigration issue will be Obama&rsquo;s downfall..</p>

<p>I could not agree more poster #8! I do not even want the LEGAL ones here.</p>
<p> What most White Americans do not seem to grasp is that these nonwhites who are even &#8220;legal&#8221; are not our friend and never will be. By their hugh numbers alone (and climbing by the second) they will destroy White America and we see that now, yet very few Whites will say it or even think it, let alone do anything about it. They won&rsquo;t even save their own progeny from complete destruction and genocide. </p>

		<p>A politician who works for &#8220;diversity&#8221; is really an agent of genocide against whites, and therefore is my enemy. The Hispanics who make these kinds of statements and hold these beliefs are my enemy, and America&rsquo;s enemy. This country was founded by white men, not Hispanics whose agenda is destruction of the United States and the murder of it&rsquo;s native citizens.</p>

		<p>What these invaders and their Democrat and GOP allies are saying is that American citizenship should be downgraded until it is literally meaningless.  A fair question is what will happen when a large enough number of English-speaking whites agree that it has become meaningless?</p>
<p>A thinking person would have to admit that this is not really a road down which the invaders and their apologists and elected stooges really want to travel.</p>
