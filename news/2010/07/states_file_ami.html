			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FAIR Legislative Update, Federation for American Immigration Reform, July 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Last Wednesday, the attorneys general of eight states and one U.S. territory filed a &#8220;friend of the court&#8221; brief in the federal lawsuit (U.S.A. v. Arizona) to support Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration enforcement law, SB 1070. (Cox Press Release, July 14, 2010). Led by Michigan Attorney General Michael Cox, other signatories included the attorneys general from Florida, Alabama, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Because the federal court has limited the length of such amicus briefs, the states&rsquo; argument goes straight to the heart of the federal complaint: preemption. (Id.)</p>
<p>In their brief, the states forcefully refute the Department of Justice&rsquo;s argument that SB 1070 is preempted under the United States Constitution. First, they reject DOJ&rsquo;s argument that SB 1070 constitutes an impermissible &#8220;regulation of immigration.&#8221; Case law, they argue, has defined a &#8220;regulation of immigration&#8221; as defining who should or should not be admitted into the country and the conditions under which a legal entrant may remain. SB 1070 does not do either. Moreover, the states point out that federal courts have long held that state law enforcement officers have inherent authority to arrest for violations of federal law as long as the arrest is authorized by state law. (Amicus Brief)</p>
<p>Second, the states reject DOJ&rsquo;s argument that SB 1070 conflicts with federal laws such that it &#8220;stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.&#8221; SB 1070, the states argue, is fully consistent with Congress&rsquo;s intent of apprehending illegal aliens even if it does not facilitate the Executive&rsquo;s wish to selectively abandon the enforcement of immigration laws. Moreover, the states argue, SB 1070 does not interfere with the Executive&rsquo;s discretion in how it treats aliens as DOJ claims because the federal government still retains that discretion once Arizona law enforcement officers turn over an illegal alien to federal authorities. (Id.)</p>
<p> In a statement released with the brief, Michigan Attorney Michael Cox said, &#8220;Arizona, Michigan and every other state have the authority to enforce immigration laws, and it is appalling to see President Obama use taxpayer dollars to stop a state&rsquo;s efforts to protect its own borders.&#8221; (Cox Press Release, July 14, 2010). Others who joined the brief sounded a similar note. Virginia Attorney General Ken Cucinelli remarked, &#8220;[F]ederal law expressly allows states to arrest people who are not legally present in the United States. Arizona&rsquo;s law doesn&rsquo;t change any of this. That&rsquo;s why we are stunned that the government has sued Arizona.&#8221; (Cucinelli Press Release, July 14, 2010). South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley said South Dakota joined the amicus brief because federal authorities aren&rsquo;t doing enough to enforce current immigration laws. &#8220;We felt it was right for the state of South Dakota because this is really a public safety issue,&#8221; said Jackley. (KSFY.com, July 15, 2010)</p>
<p>Arizona Governor Jan Brewer thanked Cox and the other attorneys general for supporting her state: &#8220;The United States was founded as a nation of laws and not of men, and I am deeply grateful for the national outpouring of support for the rights of states and the rule of law.&#8221; (Politico, July 14, 2010).<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad Michael Cox is mentioned so prominently here, for his prominent role in this brief.  He was once thought to be a shoo in for Governor of Michigan, both primary and general.  I want him to win b/c he was the only MI state wide office holder to come out for the successful MCRI initiative in 2006.  But in recent weeks, Congressman Pete Hoekstra has taken the lead in that primary.  Don&rsquo;t know much about him, but Numbers USA gives him a B+ (even though Numbers USA is weak on the legal immigrant issue, their grades are still useful). </p>
<p>I think Cox has his mojo back.</p>

		<p>Notice that the lead comes from Michigan A.G., who is White and looks grandly Teutonic!</p>
<p>He knows what non whites have done to Detroit, and he fears what will happen to our White Republic if more non whites invade us without being sent back home where they belong and where God wants them to be.  </p>
<p>Look for the blonde, blue eyed Germanics to be the last victims of the Diversity Curse.  In their blood flows hot Saxon blood, and if they lose their liberties, they won&rsquo;t let it be to non whites. They will go down fighting.</p>
<p>The Aryan blood stirs. It may be our last hope.</p>

		<p>Filing legal briefs is all well and good, but if the states <i>really</i> want to make a difference they should enact laws identical to Arizona&rsquo;s. Let the feds try to sue 20, 30, even 40 states and see what happens. The result would effectively be state nullification. As a real-life example, Bush&rsquo;s malevolent &#8220;Real ID Act&#8221; is dead in the water because fully half of the states have refused to go along.</p>

		<p>Immigration:  to enter and settle where one is not native.  1650<br>
Naturalization:  to confer upon an alien the rights of a citizen. 1585<br>
Article 1 section 8 &#8220;The Congress shall have the power to&hellip;.establish an uniform rule of naturalization&hellip;&#8221;  <br>
Amendement X  The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or the people.<br>
I have read the Constitution entirely and nowhere does it mention immigration.  It only mentions naturalization, which is not the same thing as immigration. Both words were a part of the English language at the time of the drafting of the Constitution with the dates listed above.  This is not splitting hairs.  They are two different words with two different meanings. Therefore, the 10th amendment allows the states to manage immigration into their sovereign borders.    <br>
It stands to reason the Founding Fathers would allow the states to manage the kind of people they wanted to settle in their cities and towns.  The states were sovereign but a person must swear allegiance to the nation, not the state.  If a person was deemded fit by the state to be a member of the national family, the Federal government would bestow citizenship. This was intended as part of the State/Federal balance that Jefferson and many other Founders originally desired.  The Federal government has usurped that power, as it has many others, and it will continue as long as the states do not assert their Constitutional rights.   </p>
