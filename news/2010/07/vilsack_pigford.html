<h1>Vilsack: Pigford Case Update</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Bennett, Delta Farm Press (Memphis), July 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>During a June 30 Senate Agriculture Committee hearing, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack was asked about a resolution of the Pigford lawsuit. Earlier this year, black farmer plaintiffs agreed to settle a discrimination suit against the USDA. However, despite assurances that payments would be made quickly, funds have still not been made available to resolve the case.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also on Vilsack&rsquo;s to-do list: dealing with similar class-action discrimination cases brought against the USDA by Hispanics (Garcia v. Vilsack), Native Americans (Keepseagle v. Vilsack), and women (Love v. Vilsack).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vilsack: &#8220;Our hope is you&rsquo;ll find a legislative vehicle. We&rsquo;ve identified an offset you can tack (the necessary funds) onto so we can .&nbsp;.&bnspp.; begin the process of getting these folks [Pigford plaintiffs] paid what they&rsquo;re entitled to.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time, we&rsquo;re setting up a process where we&rsquo;ll offer a settlement opportunity for the folks in the Garcia and Love cases. And we&rsquo;re in significant negotiations with the plaintiffs in the Keepseagle case.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal in all of this is to close this chapter and begin a new chapter in civil rights within the USDA.&#8221;</p>

This is yet another GIANT RIPOFF by &ldquo;black farmers&rdquo;, many of whom have never even seen a farm. This scam started out with 2500 &ldquo;farmers&rdquo; who alleged they were discriminated against when they tried to get farm loans from the USDA. The USDA had no records of these people applying for loans so AG Secretary Dan Glickman and District Judge Paul Friedman, (Clinton&rsquo;s personal judge to handle stickey matters) decided to hand out $50,000 to almost everyone who filed a claim saying he had suffered racial discrimination. &ldquo;black farmers&rdquo; who missed the cut off date lobbied for years for the flood gates to be reopened so thousands and thousands more &ldquo;farmers&rdquo; could get their $50,000 without having to prove anything. Now congress is about to authorize $1.15 billion so these &ldquo;farmers&rdquo; can get their $50,000 of the free taxpayer money.///And now the flood gates will be opened to Hispanics, Indians and women, again with absolutely no proof of discrimination.  Just file a claim and get at least $50,000.</p>

		<p>One outcome of the Sherrod dustup is that, instead of blaming ravenous canines for the ingestion of homework, recalcitrant schoolboys may now proclaim that &#8220;Vilsack did it.&#8221;  His was a magnificent mea culpa. </p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t we just be honest about it and say the government is going to give $50,000 to every non-white in America, whether there here legally or not. Why don&rsquo;t we just give $50,000 to every non-white child on the day they are born as  payment for future discrimination? </p>

		<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve highlighted and tried to do a good job in the area of civil rights that had some shortcomings in a lot of previous administrations,&rdquo; said Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley to Vilsack during the hearing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been an advocate for the Pigford/African-American settlement. &hellip; Have you got any suggestions on how we might move forward on getting (plaintiff payments) out?&rdquo; </p>

Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley</p>
<p>Just one more race traitor. How many Black farmers are there in Iowa anyway? <br>

		<p>The good thing about electing a black president and blacks to positions of power is it will wake up more and more whites to fight back and take this country back and put into its founding stock (white, conservative men.)</p>
