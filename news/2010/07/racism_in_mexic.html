	<p>Every morning during television coverage of the World Cup, on the Mexican equivalent of the &#8220;Today&#8221; show, co-hosts chat, trade barbs and yuck it up. Behind them, actors in blackface makeup, dressed in fake animal skins and wild &#8220;Afro&#8221; wigs, gyrate, wave spears and pretend to represent a cartoonish version of South Africa.</p>
<p>Yes, in the 21st century, blackface characters on a major television network.</p>
<p>But this is Mexico, and definitions of racism are complicated and influenced by the country&rsquo;s own tortured relationship with invading powers and indigenous cultures.</p>
<p>Many Mexicans will say they are not racist and that very little racism exists in Mexico, a nation, after all, of mestizos, who are of European and indigenous blood.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the full truth is that racism is alive and well in Mexico. It is primarily directed at indigenous communities who account for as many as 11.3 million people, or roughly 10% of the national population. The indigenous remain disproportionately mired in poverty and denied work, political access, education and other rights.</p>
<p>And there is a smaller community of black Mexicans, Afro Mexicanos, many descendants of slaves first brought to the region by Spanish conquerors in the 16th century.</p>
<p>Often referred to by academics as the &#8220;third race&#8221; and concentrated in the coastal states of Veracruz, Oaxaca and Guerrero, they have been fighting for years for recognition as a distinct ethnic group, to be included in history books and to be given opportunities to transcend poverty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racism in Mexico is covered up,&#8221; said Ricardo Bucio, head of the National Council for the Prevention of Discrimination, which has protested the blackface TV caricatures. &#8220;There is a lot of denial about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, in Mexico and other parts of Latin America, people operate with a different comfort level when it comes to physical attributes. It remains common for Mexicans to use nicknames like &#8220;Chino&#8221; for someone with almond-shaped eyes, &#8220;Negrito&#8221; for someone with dark skin, &#8220;Gordo&#8221; (Fatso) for a plump person.</p>

		<p>Blacks believe that they have some sort of solidarity with Hispanics. Especially if brown or dark tan skin is involved. Even though most blacks will not admit it, they are a lot better off in a white than a Mexican society. I wonder how the financial crisis in California is going to rear its ugly head when Blacks and Mexicans engage in an all out war in places like LA. Especially when the Mexicans become the majority population and they engage in ethnic cleansing. What are the democrats going to do when Blacks and Hispanics are killing each other off in droves. Which group is going to get preferential treatment?  </p>
<p>&#8220;The issue of racism in Mexico exploded a few years back when then-President Vicente Fox, in what was meant to be a defense of Mexican immigration to the United States, told a U.S. audience that Mexican immigrants were necessary because they performed the jobs that &#8220;not even blacks&#8221; wanted to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>At least Vicente Fox was right on the money. Have you ever tried getting service at some government agency in a large city? Even though it is an air conditioned building and generally not physically difficult, a lot of blacks still won&rsquo;t do their job.  </p>

One of the problems for the US is that, during the cold war, these people started to become attracted to communism.  So the US made an unholy alliance with drug dealing sociopaths.  In return for allowing them to make lots and lots of money and discouraging the mexican government from coming down on them, these people tortured, raped, and murdered anyone who even mentioned the word communism.</p>
<p>Now, we are dealing with the consequences of destroying communism the lazy way.  Those same sociopaths have grown fat and powerful on drug money that comes mostly from American welfare.  They&rsquo;ve turned much of mexico into a hellhole.  Most mexicans know WHY it happened and feel just anger at the US and feel entitled to both treat our country with contempt and take what they can from us.  And STILL the evil relationship exists between the drug lords and our government.</p>
<p>It has to end.  The US needs to militarize that border and destroy the drug cartels that move back and forth.  Basically kill them all.  We need to cut off welfare from being used in any way for drugs.  And we should really aid mexico in bringing the rule of law back to many places in the country where it does not exist.</p>
<p>This is not just a moral issue but a practical one.  It will have to wait, however, until Congress changes hands in November and a certain amount of pressure can be brought to bear on Obama&hellip;.preferably impeachment, then dealing with such issues with Biden or Clinton.</p>
<p>If it is NOT done, this could very easily result in a war between the US and Mexico.  Americans simply do not understand or even want to understand WHY such a war would happen.  They would demand our military basically lay waste to mexico and make an example of them after they attack us.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have to happen that way.  Instead, we could have a good fences make good neighbords policy.  We could work together to get rid of the drug lords and make life much better on both sides of the border.</p>

<p>Remember, &#8220;racist&#8221; means &#8220;conservative white person.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s why we are racists while Obama, who for 19 years attended a black nationalist church whose preacher gave a lifetime achievement award to Louis Farrakhan, is not racist.<br>

		<p>The truth is, of course, that this kind of anti-black sentiment exists all over the world.  It didn&rsquo;t just &#8220;rear its ugly head&#8221; in Mexico or anywhere else.  It&rsquo;s common in the discourse of society in general and all over the internet.  Liberals, of course, pretend otherwise and refuse to allow equal-footing discussion to anything they want to label as &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>

<p>Will the United States become a less racist country when it becomes a minority/majority nation? I believe that Mexican racial attitudes will become more pronounced as they become a majority in the Western United States. Blacks will face another minority group that feels no guilt for Jim Crow or &ldquo;the legacy of slavery&rdquo;. With a stagnant, de-industrialized economy, I can see increased racial conflicts for declining economic resources. Don&rsquo;t we see this now in California? If President Obama gets his &#8220;Comprehensive Immigration Reform&#8221;, could this be our future?<br>

		<p>This should hardly be a shocker.  Trying to stamp out all vestiges of &#8220;racism&#8221; is practiced only among Caucasians.  Racism is alive and well among all other races on the planet. East Asians are strongly racist (though rather subdued about it when around whites), as are Central Asians, North Africans, and mestizos.</p>
<p>Only whites make a complete fetish of denying racial differences, a baffling and more than a little strange obsession to all other races of the world.</p>

		<p>I think it amazes most folks when they learn that about as many black slaves were taken out of Africa and sent to Mexico as were sent to what is now the United States.</p>
<p>About 600,000 total to each place over a period of about 200 years.</p>
<p>And yet there are almost no blacks left in Mex. Were mostly worked to death in the silver mines and merely replaced. NOT a self-sustaining self-replicating populace as you had during slave times in the U.S. </p>
<p>Steve Sailer had an excellent article on the entire subject. Totally ignored, perhaps deliberately so, by the Mex themselves. </p>

 <br>
 <br>
Race relations in Mexico sound pretty&hellip; oh, what&rsquo;s the word I&rsquo;m looking for&hellip; wait, I got it: NORMAL. Race relations in Mexico sound NORMAL. Making fun of people different from you is NORMAL. This is what NORMAL people do when they&rsquo;re not mentally hog-tied by PC totalitarianism. </p>
<p>After all, nobody complains about the Dutch being reduced to stereotypes about wooden shoes and windmills. And I wish I had a dollar for every time I&rsquo;ve seen Englishmen portrayed as stiff, stuffy twits with a superiority complex. <br>
 <br>
Now, I&rsquo;m not normally in the habit of defending Mexico (to put it mildly). But on this issue, it is the LA Times that has a &#8220;problem&#8221; with racism. A white female American reporter with an anglo name like Tracy Wilkinson wringing her hands that brown people aren&rsquo;t being nice enough to black people <i>in some country not her own</i> is the one with mental problems, and not Televiso or its viewers. <br>
 <br>
And then there&rsquo;s THIS howler: </p>
<p> <br>
<i>Many Mexicans will say they are not racist and that very little racism exists in Mexico, a nation, after all, of mestizos, who are of European and indigenous blood.</i></p>
<p> <br>
This is hilarious! Even amongst Mestizos are light skin/dark skin hatreds just like the good hair/bad hair controversy amongst Af-Am&rsquo;s. You know the deal with Mexican males and their big bushy moustaches? God didn&rsquo;t give meso-american Indian men much in the way of facial hair. So having a fat furry handlebar across your upper lip shows you have a substantial fraction of White ancestry. It&rsquo;s about proving you have a lot of &#8220;Rubio&#8221; (Spanish conquistador) blood and that you aren&rsquo;t just some unsophisticated Indio hick from the countryside who sells bags of oranges at intersections. <br>
 <br>
For mestizos, &#8220;good hair&#8221; means the man can grow a full &#8216;stache (or maybe even a beard). <br>
 <br>
&#8220;Bad hair&#8221; means the man&rsquo;s face is smooth, or his facial hair is wispy, or grows only in patches, looking like &#8220;crop failure.&#8221; <br>
 <br>
And   &mdash;   hard as it might be to believe   &mdash;   all of these racist traditions came about in Mexico with ZERO help from &#8220;America&rsquo;s terrible legacy of slavery&#8221;, Jim Crow, or any of the other &#8220;usual suspects&#8221; of White &#8220;racism.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Discrimination among Mexicans does exist. Fair skin and green or blue eyes are seen as beautiful. If you look at Mexican beauty queens and Mexican entertainers, you will see that this is the truth. The majority of undocumented Mexicans are brown skinned and come from indegenous backgrounds. This group is discriminated against by their lighter skinned countrymen are basically unskilled and uneducated.</p>

<p>The hispanics have already just about completed the process of ethnically cleansing the blacks out of Los Angeles.  My White and asian neighborhood now has a very low crime rate.  The reason is that the hispanics moved the blacks out of the area south of the freeway.  20 years ago black predators used the freeway to hit our neighborhood and hijack cars, rob, assault and rape pedestrians and generally wreak havoc.  A university neighborhood bars, movie houses and restaurant area had to practically close down because hordes of black predators caused so many problems.  And of course asking blacks to leave because they were drinking under age, groping girls etc brought threats of lawsuits.</p>
<p>But now the area south of the freeway is all hispanic.  They don&rsquo;t come to our neighborhood to rob, assault and rape.</p>
<p>Face it.  Our government and even more the elites who have turned our elected officials into their puppets long ago decreed that Whites must be subservient to sub normal IQ non Whites.  But at least the hispanics don&rsquo;t rob, rape and murder us as the blacks do.</p>
<p>There will never be a hispanic vs black race riot in Los Angeles or anywhere else in California.  The blacks are outnumbered and out gunned.  There might be some minor skirmishes in northern California towns like Oakland, Pittsburg, Richmond etc but the blacks are on the way out.</p>
<p>Another good thing is that affirmative action preference has moved totally to hispanics.  Efficiency and civilized behavior are now the norm instead of the last 40 years of blacks.</p>
