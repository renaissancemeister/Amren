			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John M. Glionna, Los Angeles Times, July 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In May 1998, during two deadly days of racially fueled mayhem, rioters killed 1,000 people and raped 87 women, most of Chinese descent. Others cowered in their homes as the rape squads, reportedly led by army thugs, roamed the streets of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many of the 5 million ethnic Chinese here, who represent a scant 2% of the population in this predominantly Muslim nation of 248 million, have for years awaited the results of a government investigation of the attacks. Twelve years later, no arrests have been made.</p>
<p>The inquiry stalled years ago when investigators said they failed to find hard evidence of military involvement. The Indonesian government has recently suggested that it will no longer pursue the matter, despite lingering suspicions that the riots were instigated by soldiers influenced by the nation&rsquo;s political leadership.</p>
<p>Without an official report to the contrary, many Indonesians question whether the rapes even occurred.</p>
<p>For ethnic Chinese, long viewed as scapegoats for Indonesia&rsquo;s economic woes, life after the 1998 riots has been bittersweet. On one hand, more Chinese Indonesians have run for public office and a number of discriminatory laws have been repealed. Yet many still feel like unwanted outsiders, their community cast as a greedy merchant class with allegiances to Indonesia and China.</p>
<p>Without question, analysts say, there has been progress since the ouster of President Suharto, whose government required ethnic Chinese to adopt Indonesian names and banned Chinese characters and festivals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The lot of ethnic Chinese here has greatly improved since Suharto, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the riots&rsquo; underlying problems have been resolved,&#8221; said Leo Suryadinata, a professor at Singapore&rsquo;s Nanyang Technological University who focuses on Chinese Indonesian issues. &#8220;Issues of poverty, ethnic tension and a gap between rich and poor that led to the violence are still very much alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many say the rise of Islamic fundamentalism has further marginalized ethnic Chinese. In one rural province, clerics recently disrupted a Chinese parade, arguing that the noise of firecrackers and running dragons interfered with Muslim prayer rites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many Indonesians still believe people with Chinese blood keep close allegiances to Beijing,&#8221; said Andy Yentriyani, a leader of the National Commission on Violence Against Women. &#8220;The idea is that any freedoms or authority given the ethnic Chinese will come back to harm Indonesia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Discrimination against ethnic Chinese here dates back centuries to the Dutch colonial era, when thousands were killed or forced into ghettos. Ethnic Chinese were also attacked in the Indonesian government&rsquo;s anti-communist purges of the mid-1960s.</p>

		<p>Chinese have been migrating to surrounding countries in South Asia for centuries.  </p>
<p>There is no &#8216;melting pot&rsquo; mentality in Asia.  Asians generally know who their tribe is and do not inter-marry, leaving distinctly Chinese communities in their midst with varying degrees of autonomy.  The Japanese are acutely aware that for their survival they must resist China, so they do not allow Chinese immigrants. </p>
<p>Chinese are knowingly infiltrating the West and creating a Chinese expat community to rival the ones in Burma, Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. </p>
<p>It is easy for them to exploit Western ignorance and indifference, because Westerners spend so much of their time examining their own navels they know little about the East.   </p>

		<p>There was a news-blackout of sorts when this story happened, too. That was where the &#8216;military&rsquo; angle came in. Most people had no idea there was a racial conflict. You could read the stories and not know.  </p>

		<p>Many in Asia resent overseas Chinese for the same reason many in the Near East and West resent the Jews: they do many things very well.  </p>

		<p>When I was in college I had a friend who was a Chinese Indonesian. This was long before the riots spoken of in this article. He explained to me that the Chinese because of their financial success were looked at as the Jews og the orient and had to deal with much discrimination because of it. The more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>

<p><br>
Oh, yes.  Blame the Dutch! The wicked man was the start of it all. Standard leftist blather!  </p>
<p>Well, the fact is that Vietnam, Maylaya, the Philippines, etc., ALL have had strong anti-Chinese feelings, persecutions, and riots. And these had nothing to do with the Dutch or any other whites.  Indonesia even had terrible anti-Chinese riots AFTER the Dutch left and the Dutch weren&rsquo;t there to restrain them.  How to explain THAT?</p>

		<p>These death figures always astound me. 1,000 dead in just two days!!</p>
<p>In fifty years of lynching in the U.S., about 4,000 persons were hung. [about 2,500 of those were black men]</p>
<p>And yet, the U.S. is considered to be a place full of discrimination, prejudice and bigotry.</p>
<p>Constrast those two figures and ask yourself where the real bigots live!!<br>

		<p>I think a verbal exchange between an Indonesian and a Chinese politician perfectly explains how both sides feel.</p>
<p>Chinese: &#8220;If we hadn&rsquo;t come here you&rsquo;d still be eating dirt and living in straw huts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indonesian: &#8220;If it would get rid of you, we&rsquo;d gladly go back to doing both.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not the exact quotes, and it MIGHT have been Malaysians rather than Indonesians.  It&rsquo;s been a while.</p>

		<p>One of my best friends in Australia was an ex-Malaysian Chinese, who hated Malays as &#8220;Malaise&#8221;.  He thought they were living dog poop.  We Yanks have Mexicans, Russians have Chechens, Greeks have Turks, Turks have Arabs, and Chinese have the folks in the Malay/Philippine archipelago.</p>
<p>When the Asian economic crisis hit the fan in late 1997 while I was living Down Under, the Sydney Morning Herald ran a piece about the Muslim rape squads mentioned above.  One of the victims was a 12 year-old Chinese girl.  I told my friend - who used to buy the newsopaper for our office - that from what I could see, the Indonesian police were using Ruger AC-556 carbines, and that I had better rifles at home in the states.</p>
