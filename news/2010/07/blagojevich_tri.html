			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Guarino, Christian Science Monitor, July 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Federal prosecutors say US Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D) of Illinois was directly involved in a potential $1 million offer to win a US Senate seat controlled by former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich.</p>
<p>Representative Jackson&rsquo;s involvement was brought up Wednesday in federal court in downtown Chicago, where Mr. Blagojevich is on trial facing 24 counts of fraud, conspiracy, bribery, and racketeering related to a pay-to-play scheme involving the Senate seat formerly held by President Obama.</p>
<p>What makes the allegation significant is that this is the first time prosecutors have said publicly that Jackson met with Blagojevich representatives, offering to raise money for the former governor at the same time Blagojevich was seeking money in exchange for the Senate seat appointment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jackson and Blagojevich negotiated though prominent businessmen from Chicago&rsquo;s North Side Indian community, prosecutors say.</p>
<p><b>Senate seat discussed at restaurant meeting</b></p>
<p>Rajinder Bedi, who worked for Blagojevich, testified Wednesday that he met with Jackson and Raghuveer Nayak, a Jackson supporter and fundraiser, in a downtown Loop restaurant on Oct. 28, 2008. There, Mr. Bedi said, Jackson expressed interest in the Senate seat and the discussion turned to political fundraising.</p>
<p>In that conversation, Bedi said Mr. Nayak discussed the possibility of Jackson raising at least $1 million to influence the Senate selection in his favor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jurors also listened to audiotapes of wiretaps, which show Blagojevich&rsquo;s surprise and, later, interest in Jackson&rsquo;s overtures. In one conversation, recorded Oct. 31, 2008, a few days after the restaurant meeting, former deputy governor Robert Greenlee is heard discussing Jackson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ya, that guy&rsquo;s shameless,&#8221; Mr. Greenlee is heard saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unbelievable isn&rsquo;t it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we were approached, pay to play. That, you know, he&rsquo;d raise me 500 grand, an emissary came, then the other guy would raise a million, if I made him a senator,&#8221; Blagojevich replies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The buzz around Jesse Jackson Jr.</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutors say Blagojevich later warmed to the idea of picking Jackson, but wanted to make sure the congressman would deliver on fundraising.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can cut a better political deal with these Jacksons .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but some of it can be tangible upfront,&#8221; Blagojevich is heard telling his brother Robert in a phone call recorded Dec. 4, 2008.</p>
<p>Blagojevich directed his brother to set up a meeting with Nayak, Jackson&rsquo;s representative. But the meeting was canceled once The Chicago Tribune broke the story that the former governor was under federal investigation.</p>

		<p>Why &#8220;shameless&#8221;?  That comment displays as shocking cultural insensitivity and incompetence.</p>
<p>What would be shameless (i.e. shameful) in White Culture is utterly typical and to be expected from the blacks.</p>
<p>Whites who are surprised by the blacks&rsquo; behavior prove that they have a religious faith in the outdated and disproven lie that &#8220;All men are created equal&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Chicago politics are brutal.  No one rises to the top in Chicago unless they &#8220;play the game.&#8221;  Honest politicians simply cannot make it, and very quickly get weeded out.  Nearly all Chicago politicians are corrupt.  You cannot move ahead, unless you do &#8220;favors&#8221; for others.  You can tell how corrupt each politician is, by how high they have risen.  The most manipulative, mercenary, and dishonest, rise to the highest levels.  I think that 2 or 3 of our last 4 or 5 governors are either indited, on trial, or in jail. <br>
 <br>
Never, never, never trust a politician from Chicago.</p>

<p>Give me a break.  It will not &#8220;damage&#8221; him in any way.  He&rsquo;s black, so unless he&rsquo;s in prison (and probably even then), blacks will vote for him.  In fact, they&rsquo;ll admire him all the more.<br>

		<p>Remember Marion Barry. He was reelected Mayor because<br>
he was caught smoking crack, not the other way around.<br>
Senator Jesse Jackson Jr. (ret.) will be cheered with<br>
smiles, and applause for his near successful attempt to &#8220;get over&#8221;. Better luck next time bro!. But as for Blagojevic..<br>
who had no problems sending Jesse Jackson to the US Senate..a<br>
nice 40 year sentence at an all black penetentiary will<br>
be exactly in order. Whites will not tolerate this level<br>
of corruption, for blacks its another story.</p>

		<p>As a Congressman, Jackson has represented an area that must be majority black (as most blacks in Congress do).  As Senator, he would have to attract support state-wide.  Obama won his Senate seat running against carpetbagging Alan Keyes, whom the Republicans stuck in at the last minute after their original candidate quit over a scandal.  With the present pall hanging over black politicians and the Chicago crowd in general, I&rsquo;d doubt that Jackson could get down-state votes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even if he did get no downstate votes, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter.  There are more black voters in Crook County than there are all voters south of Springfield.  That is the stated reason of the late Sen. Paul Simon, when he refused to come to the aid of whites being racially cleansed, Zimbabwe-style, out of Cairo, Illinois in the 1970s.  When Blago ran for re-election in 2006, he won by a 9-point margin statewide, but take out Crook County and only Crook county, and his Republican opponent would have won by a 6 percent margin.</p>

		<p>Nice to see more blacks in positions of power and so called &#8220;black leaders&#8221; getting exposed for the anti-white, opportunist frauds they are.  The bad thing about MLK getting killed was it made a martyr out of him.  I imagine he quickly would have been exposed had he lived, same as with Obama.</p>

		<p>It sounds like Blago may be going to the slammer, I can&rsquo;t figure out why, he is corrupt, no doubt about it but so far I have seen no proof that he did anything other than act like a blowhard over the phone. He and his wife curse, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a criminal offense, he has been accused of several things but so far no proof. I think the worse thing is shaking down a Childrens Hospital for money, that might do it but he denies it  and I see no proof  so who knows. Jesse Jackson has been a good Congressman for his district, he has done some good things but he is used to getting his way, in order for him to become Senator they had to get rid of Mel Reynolds and Voila, enter a girl he had phone sex with and he was gone, she said this happened 3 years before so that&rsquo;s how Jesse Jr. got his seat. It was so obvious, they broke Mel Reynolds and his wife had to go on welfare  and he went to jail. They don&rsquo;t just want you out in Chicago, they want you gone. You have to admit though, Blago is a character and he is funny, I don&rsquo;t think he is as bad as they make him out to be but he is coarse, but in big trouble.</p>

		<p>The day they arrested Blago, the feds got on TV and said a crime was about to be committed.  Why did they shut this thing down BEFORE it was committed and not AFTER, when they would have had a solid case?  I believe they shut it down to protect someone from getting caught in the act.  I suspected they knew Obama was going to make a deal and couldn&rsquo;t let that happen.  It looks now like it was Jackson Jr. who was about to make a deal, although I find it hard to believe Obama would let Blago give away, or sell, his senate seat without having something to say about who gets it.  Chicago politics doesn&rsquo;t work that way.  Whatever the case, the media should be asking why Obama was insisting on his replacement being Black.  That should be an issue in and of itself.  But, nothing Obama does seems to be an issue to the main stream media.</p>

I agree. You watch; he will walk, with not a scratch on his reputation (both because NO ONE expects any compotence, morals or scruples from this clown, and otherwise because the MSM would not dare mess with a black guy for any reason).<br>

<p>Are you dropping a subtle hint that you, like me, suspicion that those who really ordered the assassination of Martin Luther King looked more like him than either you or me?  (i.e. in order to make a martyr out of someone who was about to be disgraced big time).  I mean, how cynical and conspiratorial of a mind can you have to believe that just not any St. Louis hoosier (NOT the Indiana definition of the word) had the money to buy airfare from Canada to London, and fly on the day of the ticket purchase, in the era of highly regulated airlines and therefore expensive air travel?</p>
<p>Ask yourself:  Cui Bono?  Who became bigger and more prominent after MLK was assassinated?  I&rsquo;ll give you a hint:  Read this news article and take out a &#8220;Jr.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is shameful! If Je$$e doesn&rsquo;t resign, the voters will vote him out. LOL!<br>
   There is no proof so far that je$$e Jr was bribed or try to bribe Blago. If fact there is no proof that Blago committed any crime. So far, maybe later in the trial they will actually get around to finding a crime to convict him of.<br>
   In Illinois, we have what we call the Combine. This is a group of dems and repubs that are united to soak down the tax payer. Blago wanted to take over this system. Since he was reelected governor, he thought he had the power. Instead, Daley sent his attack dog, Peter Fitzgerald to destroy Blago. Blago discovered that guys like the Madigans and the Daleys have more power than him because they sat in their office for 30 years. This trial so far has been one of character assassination and to warn others not to overthrow the corrupt system. </p>

<p>Well, not in the US anyway.  Outside of the borders of the US, it is another story entirely.</p>
<p>Just ask Ron Brown:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Bill Clinton appointed Ron Brown Commerce Secretary, partly as a reward for Ron Brown&rsquo;s success as a campaign fund raiser. From day one, there were allegations surrounded the exact means and methods by which this success was attained. Investigations into Ron Brown&rsquo;s activities&hellip; were nearing the point of indictments, and Ron Brown had publicly stated that he would not go to jail alone when the airplane carrying Ron Brown and about 30 other people crashed in Bosnia.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Ron Brown was just one of four Clinton campaign fund raisers to die under questionable circumstances. The others were C. Victor Raiser II, Hershel Friday, and Ed Willey, a total of three plane crashes and one &#8216;Fosterization.&rsquo; Following Brown&rsquo;s demise, his personal attorney as well as a co-worker at the Department of Commerce, Barbara Wise also died under questionable circumstances. As in the case of yet another &#8216;suddenly dead&rsquo; member of the Clinton administration, Vincent Foster,  Ron Brown&rsquo;s office was ransacked for files by Commerce staff immediately after his death.</p>
<p>In the wake of Brown&rsquo;s death the investigation into his activities was effectively closed down&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The PSM ignored the story instead choosing to focus on what clinton was going to name his new puppy.</p>
<p>Excellent article here, including a short video of Clinton&rsquo;s crocodile tears and X-rays of Ron Brown&rsquo;s skull (there were questions as to whether he was shot before the crash):</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/24edaup" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/24edaup</a></p>
<p>I suggest everyone read it while he/she still has the chance.   I&rsquo;ve noticed lately that these types of articles are increasingly &#8216;being disappeared&rsquo; from the Internet.</p>

		<p>Anonymous # 2, your last phrase, though possibly technically correst, is redundant. It could simply read, &#8220;Never, never, never trust a politician&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>JJ is teflon. Nothing can possibly damage his reputation. Because he has been inducted into the &#8220;Civil Rights Activist&#8221; Hall of Fame by association, nothing bad sticks and nothing good wears out (or off). Whites can&rsquo;t touch him for fear of tarnishing that invisible halo, and blacks won&rsquo;t see or admit the truth.</p>

		<p>Everything about Jackson is phony.  From the way he talks to his pretension of having high ethics and morals.  </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a case where we have a black and a white who are about equally unfit for anything, let alone public office.</p>
<p>How in God&rsquo;s name did Blago EVER get elected governor?  Even the way he walks and combs his hair is phony.</p>
<p>And what is this dope thinking?  I mean, he&rsquo;s facing serious felony charges and he makes the talk show circuit smiling, laughing and unconcerned about anything.  It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I imagine by the time he&rsquo;s served a bit of time in the slammer and possibly winds up being some convicts girlfriend, it will take the swagger out of his walk and the smile off his face.</p>
<p>Too, I wonder if he&rsquo;ll have a change in attitude about how he regards blacks?</p>
