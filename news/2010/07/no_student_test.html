<h1><a href="http://www.hometownannapolis.com/news/top/2010/07/18-47/No-student-tests-ontwo-Muslim-holidays.html">No Student Tests on Two Muslim Holidays</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elisabeth Hulette, Capital Gazette (Annanpolis), July 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>No tests will be scheduled in the county&rsquo;s public schools on two Muslim holidays this year: Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.</p>
<p>Local Muslim leaders have been requesting the change for two years, arguing that students who practice Islam and are granted excused absences on those days shouldn&rsquo;t have to miss exams.</p>
<p>School officials finally complied in the calendar for next year, acknowledging that it makes sense in light of the growing number of Muslim students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other religions are also acknowledged in the school calendar, most notably through the Christian holidays of Christmas and Easter, which annually are included in the winter and spring breaks. And about five years ago the schools began closing for two major Jewish holidays: Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, and Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year.</p>
<p>But no Muslim holidays have appeared on the school calendar  &mdash;  until now.</p>
<p>Eid al-Fitr (Sept. 10) is a celebration at the end of Ramadan, the month of fasting, and Eid al-Adha (Nov. 17) is a day of sacrifice honoring the prophet Abraham, who was willing to sacrifice his son at God&rsquo;s request. On both, Muslims pray and give to charity.</p>
<p>No tests will be scheduled on either holiday in the schools this year, and no sports games will be scheduled on the previous evenings, since  &mdash;  like the Jewish holidays  &mdash;  both begin at sundown, Tudor said.</p>
<p>The Anne Arundel County Muslim Council has been asking for two years that no tests be scheduled on the two days, said Rudwan Abu-Rumman, the council&rsquo;s president. The group would have asked for the schools to close, but decided to temper their request to something more reasonable, he said.</p>
<p>One way or another, it&rsquo;s important for those days to be considered by the district so that Muslim teachers and students feel welcome here, Abu-Rumman said. And it&rsquo;s particularly important now, because schools here and elsewhere are trying to recruit Arabic language teachers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Statewide, the Maryland Muslim Council also has been pushing for schools to close on the two holidays, said Rizwan Siddiqi, a spokesman for the council, which estimates there are more than 350,000 Muslims in Maryland.</p>
<p>The state Board of Education has been receptive, he said, but the discussion keeps touching on a disagreement within the Muslim community.</p>
<p>The holidays are scheduled on the lunar calendar, and for 1,400 years Muslims looked to the sky to decide whether festivities would occur the next day, Siddiqi said. Now that scientists can predict lunar cycles, some more liberal Muslims would like to schedule the holidays in advance, which would allow them to be marked on school calendars. But more orthodox observers prefer to wait and follow the moon.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A small fight also has been brewing in Baltimore County over the two Muslim holidays. According to Charles Herndon, a district spokesman, the schools have long refrained from scheduling tests on the two Eid festivals, but now a Muslim group is asking the schools to close completely.</p>
<p>District officials have been refusing on grounds that the state doesn&rsquo;t allow days off for religious reasons. For Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashana, on the other hand, they close for secular reasons: So many students and teachers were taking off on those days that instruction was disrupted.</p>
<p>No such disruption has been observed on the Muslim holidays, Herndon said.</p>

		<p>9/11 is a direct consequence of the passage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act which repealed America&rsquo;s National Origin immigration policy which kept high fertility muslims out of America for many decades.</p>
<p>If America had maintained its national origins immigration policy and tolerated 0 illegal immigration, 9/11 would have occurred with probability 0. That is to say if there was massive hostility to the presence of muslims in America,muslims would have steered very clear of America&hellip;and 9/11 never would have occurred. </p>
<p>Right after 9/11, there was a video showed over and over again of Osama Bin Laden&rsquo;s second in command-his personal physician-explaining to an American TV journalist:&#8221;America is a very open society..very open&hellip;no problem..no problem&#8221; This is his exact  words said with a mischievous smile on his face&hellip;these words were spoken three weeks before 9/11. How open:it was recently reported on the science NOVA that three of the 9/11 suicide bombers were partying in a hotel that could be seen from the windows of the NSA. All three of these 9/11 terrorists were US citizens-acquired- living in Florida raising families.</p>
<p>Apparently nothing has been learned since 9/11. The muslim population in America since 9/11 has increased by at least one million&hellip;while White Americans gossip about Lebron James.</p>
<p>BY many orders of magnitude the muslim threat in America is overwhelmingly demographic. This news story makes this obvious point very clear.</p>
<p>Treason is the reason. </p>

If the schools can be made to capitulate for Jewish and Muslim absences, then summer and winter solstice for &#8216;whites only&rsquo; should be allowed.</p>
<p>The ball really should be put in motion by significant numbers of whites leaving Christianity for Nordic Odinism, with its own holidays. </p>
<p>Eventually the system would be compelled to break apart into separate entities.<br>

		<p>Depending which stats you refer to, and it is admittedly hard to get 100% reliable numbers on this, there are now likely as many Muslims in the US as there are Jews - who themselves being a tiny minority were afforded their own national holidays. Thus, I see this as inevitable - more multicult madness. Welcome to the melting pot folks&hellip; </p>

		<p>This is just another example of Muslims screaming for special priviliges. Obviously there is enough of a Jewish population in the county to warrant closing the school for the holidays since enough teachers and students were taking the day off that it was more expensive to keep the school open. Muslims, like any other religious minority has the privilige of being excused for the holiday. The Muslims are pushing for closing the schools, which would cost the schools more money than the above mentioned situation. It is a situation of giving an inch and taking a mile- there are other situations where Muslims have been given special prayer rooms, excused from mixed sex gym classes and allowed the girls to wear the hijab when Christians have been fired for wearing a cross or reading a Bible on their own time. </p>

<p>Of course it is, Jupiter. That has been the agenda for decades, if not more. I would tend to say way more, I would say when the Africans were brought here deliberately as slaves so as to KEEP them here and then free them into our midst. THEY knew what would happen.  I am so amazed that most Whites have not seen this by now. Even a few posters on Amren seem to not understand.</p>
<p>ANY other race inside our homeland leads to our destruction and I don&rsquo;t care if they happen to be Black, Mexican, Arab, Asian, etc, we would not be having the majority of problems we are facing today in America if not for the traitors among us. I am old enough to remember the good days of growing up in a mostly White town(99%), crime free, neighborly, safe, fun, beautiful carefree days and nights and the list goes on and on. </p>

		<p>Excusing these minority holidays by saying that Christmas and Easter are allowed is disingenuous and deliberately misleading.</p>
<p>Easter always falls on a Sunday.  Therefore, it is not a school holiday, and it is irrelveant to this discussion.</p>
<p>Christmas was declared a legal holiday by President Ulysses S. Grant  in 1870. Thus, it is a FEDERAL holiday, not a local school holiday. Christmas is also a holiday observed by the vast majority of the population, not just a few.  Even for the non-religious, it is a folk holiday, a part of our culture. It was observed by our people long pre-dating the introduction of Christianity. That makes it (for many)  not entirely religious, but cultural. Therefore, an attack on Christmas is an attack on our culture.</p>
<p>Persons of minority religions are entirely free to request excusal on their holy days. Nobody is forbidding them to take this time. But it seems not right to the great majority to have to  bow to the observances of a small minority. </p>
<p>Is every religious sect   &mdash;   parsees, druids, etc.   &mdash;   now to demand their own special  holidays? Where will this lead?</p>
<p>The only reasonable solution to this multiculty nightmare that we have created is to be strictly secular and have NO religious holidays at all   &mdash;   which is not likely to please them either.</p>
<p>Since the 1965 immigration act, coupled with our almost worshipful pandering to &#8220;minorities&#8221;, we have painted ourselves into this corner.  Now, it&rsquo;s our dilemma how to get ourselves out of it.</p>

		<p>Since we are on the topic of treason. The US military-high ranking military officers-are enthusiastic supporters of importing high fertility young muslim men and having them serve in the US military.</p>
<p>The US military argues that America has to occupy Afganistan and Iraq-Republican and Democratic party jobs program for America&rsquo;s Native Born White American Youth from the American Heartland-because if America didn&rsquo;t, the muslim terrorists would come to America and kill Americans. For making these staments, high ranking US military officers should be put on trial for treason..especially after the Fort Hood massacre of American teenagers by a Muslim legal immigrant serving as an officer in the US military.</p>
<p>Islam is expanding very rapidly in America. It is expanding only a few miles north of the New Market Battle Field in the bucolic Shenandoah Valley. Just look to the right a few miles before Denny&rsquo;s. Why are Native Born White Americans being forced to compete with high fertility Muslim legal immigrants-and their &#8221; &#8220;American&#8221; born children for the scarce resources of America? Treason is the reason.</p>

<p>Problem is that the &#8220;freedom of religion&#8221; was NEVER meant to mean different RELIGIONS coming into America! The Founders had too much sense to know that allowing different religions (races) to come here would destroy America and the White race. They knew that word America was synonomous only with WHITE America.</p>
<p>Freedom of Religion has been taken over by the marxists for a long long time making White America think this is what was meant by the Founders. It was meant for different DENOMINATION/SECTS of Christianity only.</p>

		<p>This is just another reason to get rid of public schools all together. This kind of thing is just the tyranny of the minority once again, if one person is offended they are not told to &#8220;get over it&#8221; everything is cancelled to appease that one person. If there were no public schools each religion could start their own schools and have their own holidays- it is as simple as that. However even though the Muslims have their own schools they try to foist their own beliefs off on everyone else even though they might be only a small percentage of the population. </p>

Muslims: Your mosques are not holy places. Your god is one of hate and death. Your prophet is a dead, insane and evil man. Your daily prayers are nothing but rote citations that require no faith only blind and ignorant obedience. Your unholy book exhorts its believers to destroy anyone who resists your depraved beliefs. Quite frankly, you&rsquo;d be better off embracing atheism.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know which high ranking officers you know, but those I know do not want muslims in the U.S. military, they can&rsquo;t be trusted. Those officers I know, and I know lots of them, are over here and are having muslims FORCED on them and the muslim betrayal is all to often fatal to our troops.</p>
