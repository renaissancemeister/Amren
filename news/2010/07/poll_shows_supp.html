<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new poll of voters shows support for an Arizona-style immigration crackdown in Ohio.</p>
<p>In the survey released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University, 48 percent of Ohio voters say they approve of Arizona&rsquo;s tough new immigration law. It requires police to question a person&rsquo;s immigration status if there&rsquo;s reason to suspect the person is in the country illegally.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight percent say they disapprove.</p>
<p>Tuesday night, at the Berligner Park softball diamonds, nearly everyone we spoke to agreed with tougher immigration.</p>
<p>If the feelings here are any indication, the Quinnipiac poll is accurate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them are going back to other states. Some of them are going back to Mexico,&#8221; said  Alex Flores who runs La Voz Hispana, an Hispanic newspaper based on the west side of Columbus.</p>
<p>He says the Mexican population in Central Ohio is already shrinking.</p>
<p>He claims there are approximately 80,000 Hispanics living in Central Ohio but it&rsquo;s down about 20 percent from a year ago.</p>

		<p>Every white person, man and woman, at our jobs and our neighborhood supports the Arizona decision. That&rsquo;s about sixty people. There must be somebody against it somewhere, but they have nothing to say, I think. The crazies can see where the wind is blowing.</p>

		<p>Every time a poll is conducted on an issue I think that most Americans support it always seems to be lower than it should be.  Not even a majority support Arizona&rsquo;s law in Ohio?  I don&rsquo;t believe it unless they&rsquo;re polling metro areas with large latino populations.</p>

		<p>The approval rate should be 60% at the minimum, including at least 70% of white folks.  Who are the 28% who disapprove?  </p>

		<p>I live in SE Ohio, and I&rsquo;m sure the sentiment here is even more anti-illegal, even though we&rsquo;re yet to be overrun.  There are a small number of Hispanics here, the most visible running Mexican restaurants.  The threat of illegal-related crime is, however,  always looming on the horizon.<br>
I can&rsquo;t figure why even 28% of Ohioans would be against the AZ law, unless they simply don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>

		<p>Immigration divides the economic elites of both parties from the rank and file.  When rich Democrats think of immigrants, they think of the Statue of Liberty, &#8220;huddled masses yearning to breathe free,&#8221; and so on.  Rich Republicans think of becoming richer Republicans, because that is what a high rate of immigration allows them to become.<br>
 <br>
A high rate of immigration means more more customers, and more job applicants.  By the law of supply and demand that means higher prices, lower wages, and consequently higher profits.  If you get your income from rent, interest, and dividends, you benefit from a high rate of immigration. If you work for a living, you pay the price.  <br>
 <br>
The high rate of immigration is a major reason for the growing income gap.  The turn of the last century was also a time of high economic inequality, and for the same reason.  </p>

		<p>Here are the results from a recent poll in one of the main papers in Los Angeles: </p>
<p>Should California consider adopting Arizona&rsquo;s immigration law?<br>
Yes - 90%<br>
No - 10%</p>
<p>Yet, this same paper had this headline today:</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama&rsquo;s Push on Immigrant Bill Lauded!&#8221;</p>
<p>Right under that:  &#8220;Reports Show U.S. Back in Fiscal Slump&#8221;</p>
<p>It is no wonder the propaganda media is dying.</p>
<p>The immigration system is not &#8216;broken&rsquo;; it is not being enforced. Eleven million illegals?  I believe it is more like 25-30 million.  If current illegal colonists are amnestied as the current government desires (to create a democratic voting bloc in perpetuity), they will be able to sponsor more family members swelling the number of &#8216;new American citizens&rsquo; to (what?) 50 million or more  &mdash;  ALL entitled to a full panoply of welfare benefits, the educational system, and the new National Health Care system.</p>
<p>How will all of this be paid for?</p>
<p>Heritage Foundation reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Entitlements are the greatest domestic challenge the nation faces&hellip; This tsunami of spending is a major threat to limited government because it runs on auto-pilot with automatic increases locked in by each program&rsquo;s governing laws&hellip;entitlements get the first call on resources. </p>
<p>This &#8216;locked in&rsquo; spending is steadily undermining the economic future of younger generations who face a debt burden of $200,000. The moral and ethical challenge from the entitlement tsunami is undermining our democratic system as more Americans become dependent on the government and other priorities are automatically preempted&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>But then, maybe that&rsquo;s the point, massive Cloward-Piven to collapse the economy.</p>
<p>Yet some of the younger posters on here have harshly criticized ME for being &#8216;gloomy&rsquo;, claiming they have a &#8216;bright future&rsquo; ahead of them, one suggesting I slit my wrists now!</p>
<p>What say you younger generation?  After all, your cohort (under 30) was obama&rsquo;s largest support group, voting for him 66%.  How is that &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo; working out for you, for your &#8216;brighter future?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p>&#8220;Whites living in societies run by non-Whites are in physical danger.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Compare today&rsquo;s political awareness about immigration to that of 12 months ago, and the difference is stunning.</p>
<p>For the last forty years, most Americans were blissfully indifferent, or brainwashed into believing that immigration policy was a fait accompli they had no influence over.  </p>
<p>Because of an incoherent mumbo-jumbo of airy concepts like &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; &#8216;humanitarianism&rsquo; &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo; and &#8216;equality&rsquo;, most Americans were not engaged in the issue.</p>
<p>Now, immigration policy is uniting Americans from coast to coast.</p>
