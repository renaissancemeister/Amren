<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tea Party leaders will address charges of racism and take shots at big government in a July 31 rally at Independence Mall in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The site for the event features 13 speakers, with at least 8 speakers being persons of color.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Independence Hall Tea Party is hosting the event, in the wake of the NAACP&rsquo;s public call for the Tea Party to denounce members who are openly racists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the latest face-off between the conservative political movement and the NAACP on CBS&rsquo;s &#8220;Face the Nation&#8221; program, Webb [TeaParty365 co-founder David Webb] accused the head of the NAACP of practicing &#8220;selective racism&#8221; in calling on the Tea Party to denounce members that use racist language.</p>
<p>Webb, an African-American, accused NAACP President Benjamin Jealous of &#8220;playing the race card&#8221; for suggesting that fringe elements attending the rallies represent all members of the Tea Party movement.</p>
<p>But he also cited steps the party is taking to be more inclusive, such as planning an upcoming unity rally and expelling Tea Party Express spokesman Mark Williams for a letter on slavery that Webb called &#8220;offensive.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s over for the Tea Party. It has been defeated. White Nationalism-the complete rejection of the race-replacement of the Native Born White Majority at the hands of high fertility post-1965 nonwhites-is the only game in town. </p>

		<p>Why do they feel the need to pander to blacks and multi-culturalists? Their base certainly isn&rsquo;t going to respond positively to that. Just like the GOP didn&rsquo;t win any black votes by appointing chairman Michael Steel, and likely alienated quite a few whites.</p>

		<p>First off, I expanded a few ideas I had here at AR earlier to come up with a more fundamental theory.  It&rsquo;s long, but better explains some of my reaction to the things in this article than actually being long-winded here:</p>

<p>The goal seems to be impressing the ruling class&rsquo;s media and their shill of a civil rights cabal.  As long as they&rsquo;re against the &#8220;big government&#8221; that blacks want/need to as much as survive in an advanced society, they&rsquo;ll always be racist.  </p>

<p>We know exactly why they are doing this. They never learn, do they? Problem is, the Tea Party HATES racially aware Whites. They are a bunch of White cowards. In other words they are as bad as any leftist when it comes to race. They hate their own White skin and apparently their children&rsquo;s White skin. </p>
<p>They more or less said so by saying they do not want &#8220;racists&#8221; or &#8220;White Supremacists&#8221; in their midst. That is when I totally tuned those people out.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been to one Tea Party back a few months ago when Rand Paul was running in the primaries.  These events draw lots of older and elderly people that I&rsquo;m sure lived through America&rsquo;s better days and also the 60s civil rights sham, MLK and the riots.  It&rsquo;s impossible to believe that these people aren&rsquo;t racially conscious and that they know exactly what&rsquo;s wrong with America.  The problem is with the Tea Party organizers who invite these speakers to talk about alot of neoconservative gobbelty goop.  It&rsquo;s the neoconservatives pushing this multicultural &#8220;conservatism&#8221;.  It was the neoconservatives that turned America away from the Republican Party.  It&rsquo;s the neoconseratives keeping the younger people away from participating in the Tea Parties in large numbers.  What kind of young person wants to hear someone urging them to get their legs blown off or die in the Middle East for &#8220;democracy&#8221;?  Democracy being a code word for another country. There&rsquo;s no diversity of opinion either.  There were no paleoconservative or libertarian speakers and they sure as h#ll don&rsquo;t want to hear from White Nationalists either.  </p>

		<p>Congressman Charlie Rangel explained it best back in 1996 whent he Republican regained control of the House:<br>
  &#8220;They dont say &#8216;N_____&rsquo; or &#8216;Sp__&rsquo; anymore, they say &#8216;let&rsquo;s cut taxes&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So there you have it.  Limited government is racist, therefore the TEA party is racist.  </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with having black conservatives address the gathered Tea Party multitudes?  It at least serves to remind people that there are blacks independent and smart enough to understand how free enterprise and the republic are supposed to work.  </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re supposed to tell these people to bugger off, that we don&rsquo;t want either their help or agreement?  </p>
<p>Sounds like a pretty stupid way to get your point across.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see a problem with the Tea party making taxes, monetary issues, and the constitution, there priority. </p>
<p>The problem is that they are going to practice racism while saying they aren&rsquo;t racist. Intentionally choosing speakers because they are Black is racist. They should simply be choosing their best speakers. I&rsquo;ll listen to any good speaker regardless of what race they are if they have good ideas that they can articulate. It&rsquo;s the ideas that count not the race of the speaker.</p>
<p>What I find really bothersome is how can we expect the Tea party to uphold the principles of the constitution and build a merit based society when it&rsquo;s going to chose it&rsquo;s speakers based on race? How can we hope it will end Affirmative Action when it is essentially practicing it? I hope this is a temporary reprieve from their constitutional principals.</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s a mistake to give this much credence to the NAACP&rsquo;s charge of racism.  If the Tea Party should respond at all, they should simply tell the NAACP to clean up their own house.  I consider myself a Tea Party supporter and have a bumper sticker declaring it.  I get a lot of dirty looks and middle fingers from Blacks and Hispanics and stupid Whites because of it.  Anyway, I don&rsquo;t think we should turn on the Tea Party movement because a few leaders are taking a wrong path here.  I believe a lot of Whites who are fed up with high taxes and big government are also fed up their taxes going to benefit  minorities who take too much and contribute too little.  While I don&rsquo;t think it would do the Tea Party any good to take on the racial component of the financial mess this country is in, niether should they try to pretend it doesn&rsquo;t exist.  This race debate is just what the enemies of the Tea Party want and we should not participate.  Neither should we turn on ourselves because a few of us don&rsquo;t see things right.  Insted, we should stick together and replace those leaders among us who need replacing with the least possible damage to our own cause.  The Tea Party is the only movement around that Blacks and Hispanics fear.  We need to keep it that way. </p>

		<p>At Independence Hall, eh?  Perhaps they can hold their media announcements next to the FEDERALLY funded and installed National Historical Marker right in front of Independence Hall which proclaims the site as the first ever Homosexual protest in Philadelphia.  Kind of appropriate.  Like the sign, the Tea Party now disregards the founding purpose of the Declaration and the events that took place on that site, and pander to an agenda and group which completely rejects those White principles and founding morality.  Perhaps an additional sign is in order at that spot:  Here the Tea Party met it&rsquo;s demise by pandering to their avowed enemy and allowing that enemy to frame the debate away from the founding principles established here in 1776.</p>

		<p>People who are disappointed with the constant pandering should realize that the Tea Party is only an intermediate step to an out-and-out racial consciousness movement, if it comes. The Tea partiers are still playing by the old rules yet now people are starting to demand that the old rules be applied to blacks and other non-whites as well, like the recent NAACP flap. Still not good enough but yet another step towards real WN. The mosque at ground zero is yet another example, where major names like Sarah Palin weighed in, on our side, something national figures would not have touched five years ago. Palin is a lagging indicator and very useful in determining momentum, never mind that she is not anywhere close to being a WN. A sort of Cloward-Piven effect is now working in our favor. Think about the progression of events over the last 20 years and you won&rsquo;t be so disheartened or impatient (if you are, that is). Just let&rsquo;s keep the pressure on.<br>

		<p>Read A. W. Morgan&rsquo;s piece in today&rsquo;s vdare.com to get a full idea of the Tea Party&rsquo;s fecklessness.  The movement&rsquo;s dumping of its own Mark Williams for &#8220;racist&#8221; comments, a capitulation to the NAACP by any name, speaks volumes about why it&rsquo;s not going anywhere.</p>

		<p>Everyone reading Amren.com needs to prepare for what they will do when they or anyone they support is smeared with the accusation:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re  a RACIST&#8221;.</p>
<p>Most White Americans simply do not know what to do when our enemies &#8220;play the race card&#8221; and most White Americans simply give in, pandering, show extreme cowardice always trying to deny that they have any, ANY loyalty to our people or seek to work for the legitimate rights of our people, the same as all non White groups work for their groups.</p>
<p>Check out this CNN Wolf Blitzer interview with Ron Paul - who is being smeared with the RACIST label.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKBlk1Vpeuw&amp;feature=player_embedded" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKBlk1Vpeuw&feature;=player_embedded</a></p>
<p>Ron Paul is horrible here, is completely on the defensive, basically accepts the anti White accusers position that writing, saying or thinking anything negative about Black rioters/murders is a terrible thought crime. So Ron Paul tries to deny he wrote or even read his own newsletter. Pathetic.</p>
<p>I suggest others here gets some practice on what to do when you are smeared in this way. And my advice is to get off playing DEFENSE and go on OFFENSE.</p>
<p>So when openly racial non White racial advocacy groups like the NAACP or LaRaza - &#8220;THE RACE&#8221; smear you as a RACIST, come back with the truth that the very names of these organizations (THE RACE) are RACIST.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t back down, grovel, pander, give in.</p>

		<p>A few Amrenners would do well to remember a founding truth of our cause: Race is more than skin deep.</p>
<p>Conservatism, Constitutional principles, limited government: these are all white ideals. Sure, there are a few blacks in the Tea Party. These ideals are not EXCULSIVELY white, there is bound to be a few oddballs. </p>
<p>That being said, I do agree that the Tea Party should not be pandering to the enemy. Only the best speakers should be allowed the floor. The only rebuttal they should give to the charge of racism is that anyone who shares their ideals can be part of the movement. Then move on. </p>
<p>Do not let the dumb actions of a few organizers cloud your opinion of the movement. Ignore Palin the cheerleader. This well-organized base of voters has the potential to be a great block to the anti-white establishment. </p>

		<p>I used to think the tea party had a chance, until I ran for office.  I was INVITED to speak to their little group and when I showed up I was charged for attending.  It was only 9 dollars, however when you invite someone because you want to hear what they have to say it is beyond tight fisted to charge them.  To top it off I didn&rsquo;t even eat their dang cupcake or drink the coffee.  Even better, they had invited democrats as well.  That there showed me it is about money and how to get it from people.  <br>
Unless the tea party becomes an explicitly pro white racial based movement it will fail, becoming a shill for GOP party bull at best.</p>

		<p>&#8220;These events draw lots of older and elderly people&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, people who won&rsquo;t be around for long and who allowed all this mess to happen in the first place.  We need to focus on reaching young people who are still open minded and have a long life ahead of them.  That&rsquo;s where the maximal return is.  </p>
<p>Nationalist parties in Europe disproportionately draw their votes from younger voters, that&rsquo;s part of why they are growing.  Every year, more young Europeans gain the right to vote and they are increasingly voting for parties that oppose immigration.  At the same time, older people who vote for the &#8220;respectable&#8221; parties are dying off.  It&rsquo;s the opposite of the conservative movement in the US.  </p>
