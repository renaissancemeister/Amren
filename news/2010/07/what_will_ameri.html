			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Liane Membis, CNN, July 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his new book &#8220;The Next Hundred Million: America in 2050,&#8221; Joel Kotkin offers thoughts on what the census will reveal in the next 40 years, including how migration patterns, population dynamics and cultural diversity will come to shape the portrait of the American landscape.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>CNN</strong>: You claim that &#8220;the majority in the United States becomes nonwhite by 2050.&#8221; The current census has stirred up much controversy in terms of race relations and how we as Americans choose to identify ourselves. How will the nation&rsquo;s ethnic makeup differ in relation to today?</p>
<p><strong>Joel Kotkin</strong>: There&rsquo;s going to be a very diverse minority population with large amounts of interracial marriage. What we&rsquo;ll see is that the Anglo-Saxon population will no longer be the majority. I believe the mixed-race population will grow the fastest because compared to the past, interracial relationships are increasingly tolerated and considered OK by a large percent of the younger generations. It&rsquo;s no longer strange to see a black and white couple at a restaurant together today. Yet someone visiting from the 1960s would be shocked.</p>
<p><strong>CNN</strong>: Will negative factors like discrimination because of race be eliminated in the future?</p>
<p><strong>Kotkin</strong>: I think the racial issue will always be there. Race won&rsquo;t disappear, but it won&rsquo;t be the marker it was at one time. I think that people have a different attitude now. You don&rsquo;t see the kind of concern for racial classifications that we once had. [President] Obama&rsquo;s election was a major turning point in America in defining that. I believe the current attitude will have a cascading effect of all varieties.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>CNN</strong>: In your book, you describe how the nation&rsquo;s population will grow to be nearly 400 million people in the next 40 years. How exactly will this happen?</p>
<p><strong>Kotkin</strong>: The fact is that there will be more people in the future because of longevity. People are going to start living longer, immigration will be more feasible in the future, and the United States will have a slightly higher fertility rate than other countries. This will mean more people to count in terms of the census and perhaps considering alternative ways to get that work done.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>CNN</strong>: You also describe how the U.S. will become more economically competitive in the future. How do you  &mdash;  this to Americans who have seen our current economy slide downward into a recession and aren&rsquo;t convinced about this prediction?</p>
<p><strong>Kotkin</strong>: The U.S. has relatively younger demographics, which gives it a competitive advantage. This nation attracts people from all over the world, and that&rsquo;s what gives it global advantage; we have the potential to be energy sufficient. We are the only advanced country with a growing population, agricultural surplus, lots of raw materials, significant domestic energy. The nation is entrepreneurial in culture and has a reasonably stable political system. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that the U.S. will be a hegemonic global power, but I believe the economic condition, due to these factors, will definitely improve in the future and the census will reflect that.<br>
<strong><br>
CNN</strong>: Your claims show a positive outcome for the nation amidst all the current issues in the world: war, political instability, the oil spill, lack of resources, unemployment, global warming. What should Americans consider in terms of making these changes happen by 2050?</p>
<p><strong>Kotkin</strong>: The U.S. has many great advantages going into the next 40 years  &mdash;  if we do what we need to do. There are serious problems we need to attack in terms of upward mobility and economic growth. If we don&rsquo;t do that and we have a growing population, it will get difficult  &mdash;  things will get worse and downwardly mobile for the nation.<br>

<p>I think Kotkin is using &#8220;Anglo Saxon&#8221; as a synonym for &#8220;white,&#8221; which it is not.  Anglo-Saxons, to be technical about it, haven&rsquo;t been the majority in the United States, either overall, nor among American whites, for a very long time   &mdash;   Half of all Americans are at least one-quarter German in ancestry.  I might even dare to think that Irish is as numerous or more than Anglo-Saxon.</p>

		<p> There never has been and never will be a multi-racial society of any size where race didn&rsquo;t continue as a source of tension and confrontation.</p>
<p> India holds together, yes, but there is always conflict among its polyglot population, some religion-based, some racial. Malaysia, tiny compared to India, has always experienced Malay-Chinese strife. Brazil is about half White, 40 percent mixed race, and is emerging as a world economic power, true. But if you&rsquo;ll look at the demographics of that huge country, you&rsquo;ll see that the White population tends to be concentrated in the south and southeast, the blacks in the northeast. The relative lack of mixing helps to minimize racial strife.</p>
<p> No, America will not become a &#8220;multi-racial paradise.&#8221; Many of today&rsquo;s young people, especially Whites, who seem to be more tolerant of miscegenation, will change their minds as they mature and gain some real-world life experience, the hard way. </p>

<p>That would be completely true, if it were not the law now to classify people by race, and if every major company working in the united states were not classifying employees by race also. I suppose as long at it is those in power on the left doing it, it doesn&rsquo;t deserve consideration.</p>

		<p>This nation will NOT survive in the geographic territorial configuration that now forms the borders of North America.</p>
<p>I think I can safely say that white people who are even half-way awake to the realities of race - understand that life for them, their families, and their children is going to be in GRAVE physical danger if we allow ourselves to be subjugated and ruled over by hostile and racist anti-white minorities.  This option is NOT in any way a feasible or workable option.    Ethnostates are the ONLY guarantee of White European survival, and there is NO middle ground or area of accommodation with these hostile non-whites who our hostile ruling elites have deliberately imported into North America over the last 50 years.  </p>
<p>Like Jared Taylor recently observed   &mdash;   Mexicans are only about 17 percent of the total population right now, mostly due to illegal immigration - and just look at how hostile they are already to the white majority, who&rsquo;s 100 percent White European ancestors founded this nation.  If we listen to non-thinkers like Tom Tancredo - who stated in March 2010 - that a 35% hispanic population of America wouldn&rsquo;t be something that he would be concerned about - then can anyone imagine how much hostility and an acceleration of their ethnic intimidation tactics will exist when Tom&rsquo;s non-concern becomes reality?   We&rsquo;ve all seen those signs carried by Mexican invaders out in Califorinia that tell Europeans to get their butts back to Europe, right?</p>
<p>Convert the message on those signs to raw political power and total dominance over the European founding stock of this nation, if we are turned into a minority.  <br>

		<p>Oh yes, race will still play a factor.  Nonwhites will use it like they are now to get more freebies and goodies and will probably start killing whites at this point for our money, property, women, etc.  Unless whites soon get a backbone and turn this all around.</p>

Pure hopeful dreaming.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The U.S. has relatively younger demographics, which gives it a competitive advantage.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I thought we had an aging demographic that was in need of a national ponzi scheme (flooding the US with low wage aliens) to keep it running (until it collapses like all ponzi schemes eventually do).</p>
<p>This guy wants us to believe his Utopian fantasy. And if we all believe, we can apparently make it work.</p>
<p>Americans have desperately wanted to believe that blacks, given the same opportunities as whites, could achieve parity. We all see the results.</p>
<p>Wanting to believe something and it actually happening are two entirely different things.</p>

<p>There will no longer be a country called America, long, long before 2050.  Where the United States used to be territories of various names will be the norm brought about by secession, civil war, or a kind of peaceful separation.</p>
<p>You WILL NOT ask that question, Clueless CNN representative, about the end of 2011 or midway into 2012, because the answer will be so obvious.  At that time we will be known as Brazil North, and you should feel very proud knowing you did a large part in helping the situation deteriorate to such a horrendous level.</p>

		<p>Funny how Kotkin mentions the possibility that our multicultural future might no be so rosy right at the end, in passing.</p>
<p>If I were giving the interview I would present this possibility right up front.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no guarantee that economic growth will ever return the way we&rsquo;ve seen it in the past. And growth alone isn&rsquo;t enough  anyway, as we all know. The question is for WHOM does economic growth benefit? The average American&rsquo;s income has been more or less stagnant for 30 years now. Upward mobility is already a mirage. </p>
<p>The fact is, problems with upward mobility and economic growth are problems NOW, with no sign of them getting better.</p>
<p>An increasingly multicultural future will only be more tense, given this economic reality. Our colleges and universities teach ethnic and racial solidarity, that racial and ethnic differences are to be maintained. Given this, identity politics will only get more heated as groups vie for their piece of the economic pie.</p>
<p>In this scenario even white people who have lost their majority status will have a racial re-awakening and begin struggling politically on the basis of racial identity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about to enter a balkanized, fractious and racially tense era. If someone would care to show me examples of societies with many competing racial and ethnic groups vying for slices of an ever shrinking economic pie, where things ended up happily, I&rsquo;d love to hear about them. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m pessimistic about this country&rsquo;s future.</p>

<p>The fight is not over yet.  With real immigration reform (read: promoting White immigration, denying all other immigration) and throwing out all of the mestizo invaders, this nation can return to its pre-1965 glory.</p>

		<p>No such animal as a multiracial &#8220;paradise&#8221;. Nothing multiracial is good whatsoever. It is bad enough now, let alone in the next 5 or so years, well before 2050! They keep putting out this 2050 myth, when in reality we are already the minority in the USA, Europe and the world! Many who say they are White on any census is surely not an indicator of the actual number of REAL Whites.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, people like this guy babbles on about areas that he knows nothing about.  He is part of the brainwashing of this country.  The average man on the street knows that this country is falling apart because of the massive invasion from third world countries.  This country&rsquo;s destiny is sealed once the whites become the minority as in past advanced civilizations.  The caste system in ancient India was a desperate attempt by the Aryans to avoid interbreeding with inferior genes but to no avail.  </p>
<p>By electing a shadowy black man to be its president, this country has lost it direction and identity as a white nation which is the first step among many steps to its decline.  It is delusional to think that diversity without considering the quality of the genes that this country will benefit. </p>
<p>Other races have greatly benefit from the labors and brain power of whites.  Without the brain power of the whites, this planet would still be struggling at a stone age level.  To state otherwise, is pure dishonesty.  Look at Africa and the level of civilization of the American Indians when the whites appeared.  Both technological were stone age but this is not to equate genetically that the black man and the red man are of the same level.  The white genes possess the inherent ability to create technological advances.  </p>

		<p>Joel Kotkin&rsquo;s remarks about interracial relationships will probably be a lightning rod on this forum.</p>
<p>He may be right that interracial relationships (one partner being white) are becoming more common, but this is happening in a vaccuum of racial awareness by whites.</p>
<p>My own opinion is that racial awareness by whites is on the rise, and that interracial relationships will fall into disfavour accordingly.  </p>
<p>In other words, whites will start to act like other races and marry whites in order to improve the futures of their children. A brown or mixed race baby is downwardly mobile on the socio-economic ladder.  </p>

		<p>There has been ZERO real economic growth in the USA for over 40 years.<br>
We will continue having zero growth while we hemorrhage jobs by the millions and continue to flood our country with unskilled laborers. High tax rates, intrusive government, and other such don&rsquo;t help either.</p>
<p>&#8220;it&rsquo;s no longer strange to see a black and white couple at a restaurant together today.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still utterly disgusting, and almost universally the white woman involved has no idea what her pet buck is thinking. </p>

		<p>The U.S. will likely well before 2050 either be Balkanized with fierce fighting between whites and other ethnic groups like Yugoslavia, or the country will split up into mutually hostile ethnostates. Either way, the America I knew as a child will be at best a faded memory, at worst a living Hell of a nightmare for whites. </p>

		<p>If we somehow were to develop a society which would be completely color blind as far as educational and job opportunities, then it&rsquo;s possible this &#8220;racial nirvana&#8221; the<br>
writer envisions for the future might somehow come about - this<br>
is also assuming there is no really disastrous economic downturn or hyperinflation.</p>
<p>But the reality is that &#8220;an even playing field&#8221; is not possible for the growing number of black and Hispanic students and workers in order for them to achieve, and as the European-Americans become a shrinking group in the U.S., becoming just the largest minority in a nation of minorities, they well increasingly see that affirmative action programs or a Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department that discriminates against them are reasons for them to self-consciously organize as a political entity just as all the other minorities do without any sense of guilt.</p>
<p>With all the various groups playing &#8220;political hardball&#8221;, and the European-Americans part of the game finally, it&rsquo;s hard to see how U.S. society won&rsquo;t fragment. So I really don&rsquo;t have this optimistic vision of a happy, multi-racial society in the future given these factors I have mentioned.</p>

		<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s going to be a very diverse minority population with large amounts of interracial marriage&hellip;<br>
I believe the economic condition, due to these factors, will definitely improve in the future and the census will reflect that.&#8221; Joel Kotkin</p>
<p>  So, the great liberal dream of the elimination of racism through miscegenation will somehow save us? Once Americans are all mixed race, they won&rsquo;t be concerned about race anymore? Racism will wither away like the state under the final stage of communism? Has Mr. Kotkin ever been to Brazil, South Africa or the Caribbean?  What dreamland does this Kotkin inhabit?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t share Joel Kotkin&rsquo;s bogus optimism about our multicultural, non-racial future. I see a future United States (2050) with: ever greater disparities of rich and poor, environmental degradation due to over-population, rapid decline of urban areas into vast ungovernable slums, racial and ethnic conflicts dividing and ruining communities, and finally, gradual economic decline, through mismanagement, into Third World conditions.<br>

		<p>According to Kotkin, all Americans have to do to solve social and economic woes is let in the refuse of the world and interbreed with a vengeance!  And this is bound to happen, he either directly asserts or implicitly implies, because there is more open interracial coupling, Obama has been elected, and young non-whites are pouring over the borders.  This rosy view is no more than the pipe dream of a liberal in an ivory tower. <br>
Anyone with common sense knows that the latter phenomena will not bring about a liberal utopia.  And what about the interracial couples that so gladen Kotkin&rsquo;s heart?  Is there really more interracial sex  &mdash;  or is it just more out in the open?  Surely, there must be more between white women and non-white men, but how about between white men and non-white women?  Before the 60&rsquo;s social revolution, when white women became much more available for casual sex, white men often sought out black women and thus infused a large amount of white blood into the black population.  It&rsquo;s obvious that the vast majority of  American blacks have white heritage, raising the average black African IQ of 70 to the average black American IQ of 85.  But now, white men are not seeking out casual partners in the ghettos like they once did, and that great intermixing of genes has largely halted.  <br>
As for the interracial partnering we now observe, how do we know that trend will expand?  As white women become more aware of the downside of involvement with low-class black and Hispanic men, these females may become much more reluctant to chance such encounters.  <br>
As for Obama&rsquo;s election, liberals want to give the phenomenon both a cause and effect status.  Obviously, more white people were open to electing a black President, but does his election mean we will now elect more blacks or that we will be more respecting of blacks as Presidential quality?  Of course not  &mdash;  and, to judge by reactions to Obama  &mdash;  his performance will almost certainly lower white people&rsquo;s opinions.<br>
And when it comes to liberals and their views of nations overwhelmed by poor non-whites, their obtuseness is at its worst and most obvious.  No comment is needed on this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Kotkin is using &ldquo;Anglo Saxon&rdquo; as a synonym for &ldquo;white,&rdquo; which it is not. Anglo-Saxons, to be technical about it, haven&rsquo;t been the majority in the United States, either overall, nor among American whites, for a very long time  &mdash;  Half of all Americans are at least one-quarter German in ancestry. I might even dare to think that Irish is as numerous or more than Anglo-Saxon.&#8221;</p>
<p>This may seem a petty point in this discussion, but as a genealogist who&rsquo;s studied the matter, I would like to clarify this Anglo-Saxon term a bit.  The real fact is that the first settlers were largely English descendants of Normans, as well chronicled in the genealogical work, &#8220;The Norman People in North America, which was first published in the 19th century.  Many Anglicized names like &#8220;Carter&#8221; come from Norman French origins.  Carter is actually Cartier, etc.  The genealogical work rather exhorts the incredible energy for exploration, conquest, and construction of civilization that the Norman people, a combination of Vikings, Franks and Romanized Gauls into a distinct people by the 10th century, whose influence has been the greatest of all European groups in the march of modern history.  Anglo-Saxons, Irish, Germans, Norwegians and others certainly have their place in the story, but it was the Norman English who supplied the initial drive, blood, and courage that founded the European presence in North America.  Most of those later arrivals married into the earlier Norman families as mine did.  I just happen to still have the original Norman surname, by providential fortune.<br>

		<p>The level of America&rsquo;s cultural fall can be measured simply; The not atypical sight of a young white woman, passed out on her back in a public place, open to any and all abuse.  It is as if Lady Liberty was being raped in public, or more likely, and a better analogy, on pay for view television.</p>

		<p>There won&rsquo;t be a United States in 2050.  It&rsquo;ll be at least three or four nations, with fighting still continuing in one or two.  The US has the wrong mix of ethnic enclaves and ethnic fragmentation for civil war to be either avoidable or quick and relatively bloodless.  The future of the US is not Czechoslovakia or (possibly) Belgium.  The future of the US is Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>I believe we are headed for the Old Soviet Union or modern-day South Africa.</p>
<p>This is from a translation of Solzhenitsyn&rsquo;s  200 Years Together, &#8216;The 1920s&rsquo;, Chapter 18:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;The study of Russian history, archeology, and folklore was suppressed  &mdash;  the Russians could not have a past. &hellip; Even the word &lsquo;Russian,&rsquo; as in &lsquo;I am Russian&rsquo; sounded like a counter-revolutionary cry which I well remember from my childhood. But without hesitation everywhere was heard and printed &ldquo;Russopyati&rdquo; [an  anti-Russian slur]&hellip;.demands for the removal of statues and other tokens of Russian historical memory.</p>
<p>Russian patriotism was abolished forever&hellip;.&#8221; </p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/2b577</p>
<p>And from Dan Roodt in SA:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I never thought that life in South Africa would deteriorate this quickly. Most Whites in South Africa, including Afrikaners, agree today that the future looks sombre. We are discriminated against, robbed, raped and killed in large numbers.</p>
<p>Our noble and courageous people are now suffering the ignominy of being dominated by a rapacious, anti-white, racist clique&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/2a5sxmp</p>
<p>American Whites are being vilified and dehumanized, making it easier for our elimination at the hands of non-Whites with &#8220;historical grudges against the founding population.&#8221;</p>
<p>I believe we are at a crossroads now and the upcoming elections in November <br>
will either seal our fate or perhaps being to turn this country around.  We have a huge job ahead of us if we wish to protect ourselves and assert our right to promote and advocate for our own people as is allowed every other ethnic group.</p>
<p>We are up against well-funded, formidable forces that have taken over the levers of government.  Government = Force.</p>
<p>As it is now, the government, academia and the media are decidedly anti-White  &mdash;  anyone who believes otherwise isn&rsquo;t paying attention  &mdash;  or is paying attention to media jerks like kotkin above.</p>

		<p>I find it odd indeed that population, in and of itself, is deemed to be a benefit without any qualification at all. Why? Increased consumption does not necessarily lead to a wealthier society and all economists know that. Indeed, any Chinese or Indian bureaucrat could tell Kotkin that.<br>
Since the 1950&rsquo;s liberals have railed against the value of &#8220;picnics by polluted streams&#8221; and pointlessly expanded shopping malls. Now, when the chips are really down for the economy, they suddenly find great merit in millions of more consumers. Why? The great manufacturing job base is a thing of the past; farming can and will become more mechanized and the infrastructure is crumbling as we talk. California&rsquo;s educational achievement is near the bottom of the USA&rsquo;s ranking, which means it is near the bottom of the industrialized world&rsquo;s since the USA is itself near the bottom; and this once was the Golden State, our beacon to the future. <br>
Some commentators such as Limbaugh say the answer is that liberals do not want the USA to thrive; they want it to fail. If we fail as a nation the Left is titillated and the globalist agenda goes forward. <br>
However, I think the liberals are worried; their plan might not succeed. The reason is that the cost of suppression of the middle class in the USA is a police state. The chance that disorder on a huge scale will break out increases as the federal taxation process becomes more suborned from its original purpose of creating a stable infrastructure for economic growth to the new purpose of paying the enormous debts of the government to the sovereign wealth funds, especially China.<br>
I cannot for the life of me see how the government will finesse it. I feel we are in for a long grind downward. What is most frightening is that the debt we have incurred is so huge it will never be paid off. We are in peonage as a nation. <br>
I think since prosperity will be see to be a mirage unless debt is scaled down, and that means downsizing. Secession is in the works and we all know it. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Kotkin: I think the racial issue will always be there. Race won&rsquo;t disappear, but it won&rsquo;t be the marker it was at one time. I think that people have a different attitude now. You don&rsquo;t see the kind of concern for racial classifications that we once had. Obama&rsquo;s election was a major turning point in America in defining that. I believe the current attitude will have a cascading effect of all varieties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed Comrade Kotkin, the &ldquo;racial issue&rdquo; will always be there because it is an immutable (popularized miscegenation aside) fact of nature and genetics. It is not subject to the whimsies of &ldquo;journalists,&rdquo; or the devilishly wretched machinations of politicians, regardless of their &ldquo;insights&rdquo; and &ldquo;goodwill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, that [General Secretary] &ldquo;Obama&rsquo;s election was a major turning point in America in defining that,&rdquo; is certainly true enough, just not in the way you psychedelically fantasize about, Comrade Kotkin. </p>
<p>In the end, racial classifications and eugenics will likely be the norm on this planet by 2032 or sooner, thanks to your &ldquo;Dear Leader&rdquo; Comrade Obama. It might not be that the USA vanguards this mind you, as our &ldquo;Dear Leader&rdquo; and Co. are working overtime to destroy this country all too successfully; but what is left of it, will be all too ready to explore and evaluate the possibilities and ramifications of a defunct multiculturalism against the phoenix of racial realities.</p>
<p>May God let it be so!</p>

<i>&#8220;Now, when the chips are really down for the economy, they suddenly find great merit in millions of more consumers. Why?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Because modern economists have learned how to create the largest ponzi scheme imaginable; one run by the government.</p>
<p>In order to maintain a &#8216;modern economy&rsquo;, you need &#8216;growth&rsquo;. In order to grow, you need increasing numbers of consumers. In order to pay for entitlements, you need to bring in more workers to pay into the system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re pushing to legalize illegals. When they become legal, it&rsquo;s assumed they&rsquo;ll start paying into the system so they can support retiring baby boomers.</p>
<p>Like all ponzi schemes, it can&rsquo;t be sustained. It will collapse and our grandchildren will pay a heavy price.<br>

<p>At the risk of starting an inter-ethnic debate, perhaps you&rsquo;re right about the whole Albion&rsquo;s Seed thing, but you have to admit that Germans and German-Americans, who have been in the United States since the 1720s, brought some really fundamental ideas and propensities that are incorporated into the American experience.  For instance, the concept of jury nullification (i.e. not the black kind, but the kind to circumvent bad laws) has its roots in The Germanies, not England.</p>
