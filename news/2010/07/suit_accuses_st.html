			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jill Tucker, San Francisco Chronicle, July 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A coalition of grassroots groups and families filed a lawsuit against the state Monday seeking to have California&rsquo;s educational system declared unconstitutional for failing to adequately and equally fund schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Plaintiff attorneys say they want the court to require the Legislature and the governor to address unequal and inadequate conditions within the schools, disparate conditions that more often affect low-income and minority students.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to sue. Not only are we losing teachers and seeing class sizes skyrocket, but districts are eliminating librarians, nurses, school psychologists, core courses in art, music, PE (physical education) and electives,&#8221; said Giselle Quezada of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, a plaintiff in the new case. &#8220;Support for our schools needs to be kept at the level required for a high-quality education, and not just during good economic times.&#8221;</p>
<p>The complaint alleges that the state&rsquo;s funding system violates the legal requirement to not only provide California&rsquo;s schoolchildren with a public education, but to fund schools before anything else. It also alleges the condition of schools violates the Constitution&rsquo;s equal protection clauses, citing disparities across the state in things like teacher quality, class sizes and facilities.</p>
<p>In May, nine school districts, including San Francisco, filed a similar suit challenging how the state pays for its schools and questioning whether California provides enough money to educate all children equally. Both cases will be argued in Alameda County.</p>

<p>The main reasons why all those things are being eliminated is that all that money can be spent on the basics, so that California&rsquo;s blacks and Chicanos can do well enough to comply with NCLB, a law Ted Kennedy essentially wrote.</p>

		<p>If they want equal school funding it means that they&rsquo;ll have to increase funding of white majority schools to be equal with black and Hispanic majority schools:</p>
<p>&#8220;<br>
• Overall, urban districts and districts with high percentages of black, Hispanic or poor students spend more than other districts.<br>
• Urban districts and districts with high percentages of students enrolled in the free or reduced price lunch program spend more on salaries (per-student) than do other districts.<br>
• Districts with the highest proportion of black, Hispanic or poor students spend the most on special education overall and the highest percent of special education spending on severely disabled students.<br>
• Urban districts, high school districts and districts with high proportions of black students or students in poverty have higher overall revenues than do other districts.<br>
These higher revenues are driven almost exclusively by greater restricted revenues.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is overbearingly apparent from the above statement that Miss Quezada lacks even a rudimentary understanding of economics.  On another note, I&rsquo;m glad I don&rsquo;t live in California.</p>

		<p>The big problem with these kinds of lawsuits is that in most cases the state is already over funding the minority students.  For example, New Jersey spends more on minority students than white students and many other states have the same thing.</p>
<p>So if they already spend more on minority students and they are not achieving, how much more can you spend?</p>
<p>Here is a summary and counterpoint of some complaints around lawsuits like this.</p>
<p>#1  They complain that inexperienced teachers (less than 3 years experience) are the majority of teachers in urban districts.  Well, out of the other side of their mouths they praise the Teach for America model that promotes the idea that young inexperienced teachers have the energy to match the energy of the students.  They want to do away with tenure to fire teachers at will.  Well, so you won&rsquo;t have any teachers who make it past five years then.  You can&rsquo;t have it both ways.</p>
<p>#2  They say that inner city schools are &#8216;crumbling.&rsquo;  Well, most of those schools wre built when those areas were white majority.  Now that the whites are gone, you can&rsquo;t chase after them begging them to rebuild them.  No one helped whitey build the schools but other whites.  So let majority minorities in the cities build their own schools.  By the way, plenty of majority white schools are in bad shape in rural areas.  The building is not what makes the education.  It&rsquo;s the values of the families that send their kids there that does.</p>
<p>#3  They claim that the teachers are inferior.  Teachers today are better trained than ever before.  Most teachers in the nation are white female (80%), and the overwhelming majority of them are &#8220;Freedom Writers&#8221; wanna be&rsquo;s.  Every last dang white female teacher I know wants to save the darker races and works tirelessly in that regard.  Are black and latino teachers the inferior ones, like in Detroit?  I don&rsquo;t think you want to go there because the black and latino community are not producing teachers very quickly.</p>
<p>#4  Minorities cry that there children aren&rsquo;t being edu-cated, but school districts nationwide are reporting spectacular gains for minority students in every category.  You should see what they report out here on the east coast.  Oh, sorry, with all the high stakes testing and with jobs on the line, administrators are changing scores left and right, teachers are passing any warm bodies that come in their room once in a while and state officials are dumbing tests down to the lowest level you can imagine.  Ah, but &#8216;dem kids dey be al-right!</p>
<p>There are more issues, but I&rsquo;ll leave it there.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; &hellip; conditions that more often affect low-income and minority students </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at the saturation point. I&rsquo;m tired of hearing about low-income and minority people. I&rsquo;m sick of all the propaganda and manipulation, all the bellyaching and handwringing and sanctimonious crocodile tears. And I&rsquo;m tired of the endless demands. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m to the point that I&rsquo;d like to hear about middle- and high-income majority people for a change. Let&rsquo;s hear about the aspirations and the concerns, the thoughts, feelings, words, and actions of those folks. I want to hear everything about them &mdash; their jobs, their recreation, their health issues, their eating and sleeping habits, <i>everything.</i> Every time a high-income majority person stubs his toe, I want to hear about it. </p>

		<p>Kick out the illegals and their anchor babies, the schools won&rsquo;t be the war zones and future wrecking disasters they are right now. Stop trying to educate the uneducable, stop welcoming invaders and start using guns, prison camps and night sticks and stop granting them welfare and education on the backs of white tax payers. They&rsquo;re fleeing California for good reason, the state is a hell hole that is dangerous for whites even in rural areas now. How can children learn when they have to deal with hostile, low IQ thugs in training who despise education? There is no way, and California&rsquo;s throwing the welcome mat out for these vile third world invaders is not finding the chickens are not only back to roost, they brought some turkeys along too.</p>

		<p>This is the future of this country, Hispanics filing lawsuits to force the white minority to support for services that they are incapable of supporting.  They come here en masse creating the same mess they tried to escape.  The courts will force the whites to keep paying but eventually the money will dry up for good.  These people filing these lawsuits do not want to accept the fact that California is broke!    </p>

		<p>  Send the bill for it to the Mexican Consulate.  After all, it&rsquo;s the MILLIONS of children of illegal aliens that are choking the life out of California&rsquo;s education system.  Between the Blacks flat refusal or inability to be educated and the Mexicans demanding to be educated in their native language California has plummeted to the bottom of the rankings on school performance.</p>
<p> I left California 20 years ago and haven&rsquo;t been back since.  The whole state might as well be ceded to Mexico.  I do not see any way California can recover from decades of unchecked Mexican infiltration.</p>

		<p>The liberals have to continue with their worn-out, threadbare excuses for academic underachievement and high crime rates among blacks and Hispanics.  So, they sue CA  &mdash;  even though the state has been wrung dry by the very people the left wholeheartedly supports.  Blaming teachers and school buildings is always the last resort.  </p>

		<p>For 30 years-plus, California&rsquo;s diversitoids have done their level best to drive out the whites who were paying to keep the state running, and now they&rsquo;re worried about where money is going to come from?  Even by the standards they have set for themselves, this is bizarre behavior.  California is bankrupt, and suing a bankrupt state which white taxpayers are completely abandoning will not avail these greedy thieves one bit.  Unlike the federal government, California is unable to print its own fiat money, and a broke state can&rsquo;t even sell bonds easily.  For obvious reasons, California can not impose property taxes on the residents of other states, so the state&rsquo;s only recourse is to hike sales taxes and corporate taxes.  The obvious consequence of this will be continued flight of business from California and continued economic slowdown there.</p>
<p>I loathed the political climate there when I was an undergrad 25 years ago, and I am delighted beyond words to see the &#8220;Golden&#8221; state&rsquo;s fiscal meltdown.  As a suggestion for the Miss Quezadas of California, perhaps passing a ballot initiative mandating &#8220;everything is free&#8221; (the ballots of course printed in 417 different languages from Aramaic to Zulu) would be more effective that filing a lawsuit against a state that has no money.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed lately that the newest, latest fad or trend coming out of the ivory towers of the universities is &#8216;Social Justice.&rsquo;  Entire schools are being opened on a &#8216;social justice&rsquo; theme, and, from what I can tell, it looks like social justice means throwing off the shackles of Whitey&rsquo;s Oppressive System by Whatever Means Necessary.</p>
<p>Another shake-down of Whites for money is more likely.</p>
<p>From the comment section of this article:</p>
<p>&#8220;high-performing school: broken down computer lab, no enrichment programs, a dedicated staff of mostly older (read: more seniority) teachers, no real after-school programs, funding for fields trips and anything extra raised by the parents</p>
<p>low-performing school: brand new computer lab, computer teacher, 2 art teachers, dance teacher, 2 music teachers, social worker, full-time parent liaison, highly-dedicated and engaging staff, school undergoing massive construction.&#8221;</p>
<p>She left off full-time probation office for the low-performing school, otherwise the comment is dead-on.  I&rsquo;ve been in Title One and non Title One schools and experienced the same thing  &mdash;  she also didn&rsquo;t mention that the computers, new text books, new white boards (some that hook-up to the Internet), new desks and other state-of-the-art equipment and luxurious are destroyed by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Yes, there is certainly unequal funding, with low achieving schools receiving 25 billion extra White tax dollars in specific Title One funds OVER and above government funding of so-called &#8216;high achieving&rsquo; (read White/Asian) schools :  </p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/24yre2u" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/24yre2u</a></p>
<p>Title One, implemented in 1965, was designed to close the Achievement Gap between blacks/hispanics and Whites/Asians. This ever-hungry monster has grown from an allocation of 6.7 billion in 1965 to today&rsquo;s 25 billion with no results.</p>
<p>Charles Murray writes in Real Education:</p>
<p>&#8220;No evaluation of Title I from the 1970s onward has found credible evidence of a significant positive impact on student achievement&hellip; A study by the Department of Education in 2001 revealed that [the Achievement Gap] widened rather than diminished from 1986, the first year the comparisons were made.&#8221;</p>
<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s demands for &#8216;social justice&rsquo; in funding is just the beginning, this will spread out of California.  And Quickly.</p>

		<p>I have volunteered for nearly 20 years at Banning unified school District.These pass couple of years have been very disappointing. I was the Parent Liaison for the Middle school my youngest attends. It&rsquo;s sad to see where or what our district is allowed to do with the funds that are suppose to be used for students and teachers. I called the office of education of our county,instead of returning my call, the superintendent of Banning unified received a call. She was told that I had called.I had already spoken to our superintendent, but she doesn&rsquo;t seem to care.These people are allowed to miss use funds. I am a very concerned parent. I say these things because I have proof!!!!</p>
