<h1><a href="https://www.physorg.com/news197123539.html">Psychological Research Conducted in WEIRD Nations May Not Apply to Global Populations</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>PhysOrg.com, June 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new University of British Columbia study says that an overreliance on research subjects from the U.S. and other Western nations can produce false claims about human psychology and behavior because their psychological tendencies are highly unusual compared to the global population.</p>
<p>According to the study, the majority of psychological research is conducted on subjects from Western nations, primarily university students. Between 2003 and 2007, 96 per cent of psychological samples came from countries with only 12 per cent of the world&rsquo;s populations. The U.S. alone provided nearly 70 per cent of these subjects.</p>
<p>However, the study finds significant psychological and behavioral differences between what the researchers call Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) societies and their non-WEIRD counterparts across a spectrum of key areas, including visual perception, fairness, spatial and moral reasoning, memory and conformity.</p>
<p>The findings, published in Nature tomorrow and Behavioral Sciences this week, raise questions about the practice of drawing universal claims about human psychology and behavior based on research samples from WEIRD societies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study, which reviews the comparative database of research from across the behavioural sciences, finds that subjects from WEIRD societies are more individualistic, analytic, concerned with fairness, existentially anxious and less conforming and attentive to context compared to those from non-WEIRD societies.</p>
<p>According to the study, significant psychological and behavioral differences also exist between population groups within WEIRD nations. For example, U.S. undergraduate students are typically more analytic and choosy and less conforming than U.S. adults without college educations.</p>

		<p>This study may be approaching dangerous territory. Some of these mental areas are cultural: fairness, moral reasoning, and conformity. Note that liberal orthodoxy considers others to be the same for are human beings: visual perception,  spatial reasoning, and memory. I hope these people don&rsquo;t destroy their careers by making true statements about human mental capacities.   </p>

		<p>It is absolutely incredible how far the forces of political correctness will go to stigmatize and demonize White people.  They are throwing everything in the book at us to destroy us.  Well, hear from an Awakened White Man:</p>
<p>This does not weaken MY resolve.  It only serves to educate me and make me even angrier.  And it should do the same to every other White person who reads this garbage.  Articles like this should motivate Whites into action.</p>

<p>So, according to lefty Canadian university professors (sorry if that&rsquo;s redundant), being &#8220;Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic&#8221; equates with being WEIRD. </p>
<p>The choice of letters for this acronym strikes me as more than coincidental. Surely there are other words, beginning with other letters, that could have conveyed those qualities such as &#8220;Western,&#8221; &#8220;Educated,&#8221; etc, without adding up to an acronym as insulting as WEIRD. But of the various possible combinations, WEIRD is obviously the one that would appeal most to self-hating lefty intellectual types for being the most derogatory to white societies. <i>You mean to tell me you&rsquo;re industrialized, rich, and democratic? Man, are you ever strange! You must be nuts or something!</i></p>
<p>What would these UBC eggheads <i>prefer</i> countries to be? Non-Western, uneducated, non-industrialized, poor, and totalitarian? </p>
<p>Wait, don&rsquo;t answer that question. </p>
<p>This is all just more linguistic subversion. Just another psychological ploy to demoralize the Anglosphere. Just another brick in the wall of the Frankfurt School   &mdash;   which now apparently has a campus in British Columbia. </p>
<p>WEIRD indeed. <br>

		<p>That&rsquo;s right.  The more one dig into the psychological and cultural make-up of blacks and some hispanics, it really does get weird and scary.  Matter of fact, there will not be any universities, computers, or paper to print your studies and nonsense, only stone age technology!  </p>

		<p>There is some truth to all this. People from the WEIRD countries are more &#8220;concerned with fairness&#8221;, among other differences, according to the study. Third worlders don&rsquo;t think like us, can&rsquo;t some of these fuzzy minded people of the first world grasp this fundamental fact? Never get in a position where third worlders gain the upper hand; too late, it&rsquo;ll be found that they are not just dusky skinned white people. This is why third world immigration is an issue that transcends the usual mere economic calculations that get argued. The differences in mentality are real but not usually understood due to lack of any need to do so. Perhaps the experiences of white South Africans and their insights should be given greater study as it seems to be a potentially rich source of information. </p>

		<p>Wow, these people are idiots.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m consulting the results of a psychological study, then I&rsquo;m probably interested in how the people around me are behaving/thinking.  Therefore, studying the rest of the world is pointless.</p>

		<p>The acronym &#8220;WEIRD,&#8221;  although easy to recall, is inappropriate.  If the aim of psychological research is to supply objective findings, then the acronym &#8220;WEIRD&#8221;  is allowing a subjective label to enter into the picture. Maybe by coining the acronym &#8220;WEIRD,&#8221;  the researchers were trying to suggest that whites are an anomaly. Regardless, the term is demeaning. </p>
<p><br>
I agree that psychological research cannot be performed on a narrow group of subjects (Western college students), with the results extrapolated to the entire world.  The article raises a good concern for this field (psychology) of &#8220;soft&#8221; science. But to label the until-now research subjects as &#8220;WEIRD&#8221; is insulting, just as it would be if the label were applied to blacks, Asians, indigenous peoples, etc. </p>

		<p>To be wierd about it, what this study actually indicates provides an explanation of why even whites cannot often agree or an issue.  It helps explain why a white movement has so much trouble coalecing compared to non-whites, who have a far easier time looking at skin color, facial features, common biomechanical expressions, and perceiving a non-intellectual and compelling commonality that binds them in an identity and unit.</p>

		<p>Play semantic games all you like.  You just look childish for stooping to their level, even if it was an intentional slight rather than a hype-my-study advertising strategy.</p>
<p>What is pertinent here is that you are FINALLY seeing what could be a defining element in our struggle to discover a commonality by which to share this planet: the realization that Western cultures are truly unique because they do not represent a dominant percentage of the global population.</p>
<p>In 2050, there will be 10 billion of us.  At least.</p>
<p>Of those, perhaps 9.76% will be whites with nominally some genetic and educational advantage remaining from our highpoint in 1950 when we were about 27.5%.</p>
<p>Another 20-30% will be North East Asians who have at least an equal biological if not cultural potential to see where this demographic disaster is headed in terms of ruining our environment and depleting our resources.  To the extent that NO form of &#8216;democracy&rsquo; or &#8216;capitalism&rsquo; is worth the species level profit :loss column figures and risks.</p>
<p>Throw in another 10% of educated &#8216;other&rsquo; MAJORITY populations as the elite upper crust riding on a seething underclass of the royally stupid.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re still left with 5 BILLION-with-a-B people who have no hope of understanding mutualism as a function of universal morality or social altruism that our HG past gifted unto us as &#8216;one for all&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Because it is just not in them.  Literally, by birth or acculturation or both.</p>
<p>Do you want to fight 5 billion people for control over the planet?</p>
<p>NOW do you folks see why we need to expand IQ, even if it takes away a key social advantage from prior white/asian/jewish/parsi only hereditarian genetic legacies?</p>
<p>If we could bring our cultures up to a common level of IQ in the 120-130 range, we would:</p>
<p>A.  Have to abandon menial labor and &#8216;service&rsquo; tasks for their own commerce-sustainment&rsquo;s sake.  Capitalism would be fried because nobody would work for peanuts and robotics would thus HAVE TO move to the dominant position in manufacture, construction, agro and infrastructure sustainment.  Robots are wage-free and can even have &#8216;equivalencies&rsquo; -assigned- to representative population groups as purchase-credit equivalents.  In trade for not reproducing.</p>
<p>B.  A smart man, regardless of his skin color, who could look up at the stars and dream big dreams, is not going to be pleased if one of the ten relatives in his hut rolls over and slaps him in the teeth with the realities of living in a population burdened world.  He will cream up to the top of all his friends and neighbors and be willing to make the hard choices (negative, eugenics based, choices) -for his people- that controls the absolute size of his and their population.  Through negative and positive eugenics (Want wealth?  Have this designer kid whose genes are 80% yours.  And only this kid.)  All so that his children -and theirs&rsquo;- can move forwards.</p>
<p>If we find the genes linked directly to intelligence.  If we can get them into the population groups for -just one- generation using viral transfer or transposon based techniques at the embryonic level.  Those characteristics will -become- hereditary for that population.</p>
<p>If we live as we are now, we will either have to close off the advantages of the Western World until starvation and war balances out murderous biomass of the 3rd to carrying capacity.</p>
<p>Or we will have to impose from the outside the very laws which we hesitate to &#8216;Nazi Eugenics&rsquo; apply to ourselves.  And even that may not save us if nukes vs. resources or pandemic disease become issues.</p>
<p>WEIRDness is one way of acknowledging that we have something others don&rsquo;t.  Something which, in the longer term, may be of such imperative moral value to our collective, global, survival that they cannot survive without it anymore than we can survive, holding onto it, exclusively.</p>
<p>Rejoice that someone, somewhere, has at last seen that there is something there which is different.  Because as animals driven by statistical weighting based sapient intelligence, as soon as you notice that what you have is not the same as what your neighbor does, it is only a matter of milliseconds before your brain starts making implicit vs. explicit value judgments over whether you should be jealous.</p>
<p>10th Commandment be hanged, the world has every right to be jealous of Western culture and societal advancement.  We have done a lot of _good things_.  The question must be whether we hold so tightly to our &#8216;weirdness&rsquo; as something which others can also make use of, that none of us can survive.</p>

I see that we&rsquo;re now considered WEIRD for wanting and acting to improve our quality of life.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s the norm to want to wallow in poverty, illiteracy, and dependency, the non-WEIRDS are free to live their normal lives. Just keep them away from me.</p>
