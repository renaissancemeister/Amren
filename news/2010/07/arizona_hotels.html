			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, July 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona&rsquo;s tourism industry has a target on its back, but the widespread boycotts over the state&rsquo;s immigration law might not be hitting the mark.</p>
<p>Recent data compiled by a market research group show hotel bookings across the state  &mdash;  as well as in tourism hot spots Phoenix and Scottsdale  &mdash;  have been on the rise the past two months.</p>
<p>The numbers could dispel warnings from local officials that Arizona stands to lose a fortune and dampen the chances that cities and organizations will be able to compel the state to reverse its immigration law by choking its economy with a sanctions-style business boycott.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, the boycotts have been unsuccessful,&#8221; said Barry Broome, president of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council.</p>
<p>The data from hotel industry research firm STR showed that for the state of Arizona, hotel occupancy was up 5.7 percent in May and up 8.3 percent in June compared with the same time a year ago.</p>
<p>In Phoenix, occupancy was up 10.6 percent in June; in Scottsdale, it was up 10.7 percent for the same period. Revenue also was up, with Arizona hotels raking in $148 million last month  &mdash;  up more than 11 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p>Broome said the state also has been able to attract new businesses to locate in Arizona despite bad publicity. He said his group plans to announce 2,000 to 3,000 new jobs thanks to investment from California, where Arizona boycotts are in place in several major cities, over the next few months.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>City governments typically banned employees from traveling to the state and in some cases moved to reconsider contracts with state businesses.</p>
<p>But some of those campaigns ran into glitches along the way, watering down the impact. Los Angeles exempted from the boycott a contract with an Arizona company that provided its red-light cameras. The Los Angeles City Council also is reportedly considering another exemption for airport taxi company Super Shuttle, based in Arizona.<br/>

		<p>Most people would consider Phoenix safer and less crowded for a vacation if illegals weren&rsquo;t standing on every street corner looking for a handout or day labor. I would expect tourism will soar with this new law.</p>

		<p>Could it be the boycott is being trumped by a &#8220;buy-cott&#8221; courtesy of patriotic Americans?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, the boycotts have been unsuccessful.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The cities issuing the boycott threats are almost totally those that are on the verge of major budget shortfalls, so I seriously doubt they could offer Arizona any business at all anyway.</p>
<p>As the depression continues to get worse, it will gradually dawn on many state governments&hellip;.especially California&hellip;..that they screwed up big time by opening their doors to illegals and offering such liberal benefits.</p>
<p>And, soon, there will be more tent cities throughout the country with California leading the way.  </p>
<p>For the leftist fools, being forced into squatter camps, it will be a tragedy and a disgrace of huge proportions, especially as they become more basic without modern facilities.  The illegals, however, in these same camps will realize a standard of living on a par with the country they left, so it will be no big thing for them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping the two groups will be very happy together, because they both deserve it.</p>
<p>I wonder if Mexican consular officials will be patrolling the tent cities to assure the illegals are treated properly.  After all, if they return home, they just might pull the same protests and demonstrations they do here and the Mex government has all it can handle right now from the cartels.</p>

		<p>The boycott is failing because the &#8220;organizers&#8221; forgot one essential fact: Mexicans need Arizona, but Arizona doesn&rsquo;t need any more Mexicans.&#8221;<br/>

<p>Why not? remove the crime element, and ANY city in the USA would more likely resemble our homeland, prior to 1965, with a difference that can be measured in black and white terms.</p>
<p>So to speak&hellip;.</p>
