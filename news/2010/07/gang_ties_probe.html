<h1>Gang Ties Probed in Motive for Fatal Shooting at Park</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Sullivan and Janet I. Tu, Seattle Times, July 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>From outward appearances, the two groups were celebrating a warm summer Saturday in typical Northwest fashion: grilling food along a picturesque lakefront as children played. One group was gathered around a birthday cake on a picnic table.</p>
<p>Though separated by 50 to 75 feet at crowded Lake Sammamish State Park, several members of one group walked over and taunted members of the second group, King County sheriff&rsquo;s spokesman Sgt. John Urquhart said. The reason is unclear, though Urquhart said members of each group had gang affiliations. And many had firearms.</p>
<p>A fistfight erupted around 9 p.m., and someone from one group apparently fired a gun into the air as a warning. After that, &#8220;it sounds to me like everybody pulled out guns,&#8221; Urquhart said.</p>
<p>Gunfire between the two groups sent their members and other park visitors scrambling for cover, some ducking into restrooms as up to 20 shots filled the air. When the gunfire stopped, two men had fatal wounds and four more were injured.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Urquhart said it&rsquo;s unclear whether the motive for the shootings stemmed from a gang rivalry, though investigators are looking into that. He said the groups were made up of people of mainly Asian descent.</p>
<p>The two men killed  &mdash;  one from each group  &mdash;  have not been identified. One is a 33-year-old of Asian descent from Kent, and the other is 30, white and from Seattle, Urquhart said. At least one of them is believed to have fired gunshots, he said.</p>
<p>All of the dead and wounded were with the two picnicking groups, a law-enforcement source said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The groups are from South Seattle, the source said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gang-related incidents in King County are rising.</p>
<p>At a briefing last week before the Metropolitan King County Council&rsquo;s Law, Justice, Health and Human Services Committee, sheriff&rsquo;s Detective Joe Gagliardi said 1,084 gang-related incidents were recorded in 2009, slightly fewer than in 2008. But he said the 280 incidents reported in the first quarter of 2010 put this year on track to exceed 2009.</p>
<p>Gang investigators counted 122 criminal street gangs in King County last year, with an estimated 12,000 to 13,000 members, Gagliardi said. Of those, roughly 5,500 gang members live within Seattle city limits, he said.</p>

&#8220;Blacks commit violent crimes at four to eight times the white rate. Hispanics commit violent crimes at approximately three times the white rate, and Asians at one half to three quarters the white rate&hellip;<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Asians are arrested at lower rates than whites because<br>
they commit fewer crimes.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This place is turning into an absolute pool.  Even in the 10 years since I graduated high school I can&rsquo;t believe the change.  We&rsquo;ve got Microsoft and Boeing bringing in educated foreigners from East and South Asia and at the same time we&rsquo;ve got low-income Mexicans more and more ever day as well as the SE Asian population that was doing this sort of thing 15 years ago and apparently hasn&rsquo;t progressed too far.  We&rsquo;re being squeezed out from both ends of the spectrum.      </p>
<p>Ted Bundy used to troll for victims in this park, but apparently it was safer with him around than it is with Asian immigrants who can&rsquo;t seem to have a barbecue without having to gang bang.</p>
<p>Just goes to show you that there is NO place safe from this kind of thing. This is one of the most moneyed parts of the Greater Seattle area.  The only silver lining of this is now maybe the limousine liberal crowd out in Sammamish might wake up a little bit and see how the other half lives with all their vaunted diversity.  </p>
<p>I followed this from the beginning and a number of comments on local news pages were along the lines of &#8220;I moved out here to get away from this kind of thing, I&rsquo;m just shocked that this happened here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looks like you would have been better off standing up and opposing this stuff 40 years ago instead of running here from California or where ever to get away from it.  This is what happens as a result of your &#8220;social justice,&#8221; you can&rsquo;t go to the park in your neighborhood anymore because you insist on voting for candidates who throw open the doors for every socially-backward and mentally-scarred group from every war-torn and depraved corner of the world.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s western Washington for you.  Chock full of East Coast and California transplants who fled the welfare-state minority- loving criminal havens they themselves set up for greener pastures.  They came here for the clean air, light traffic, and low crime rate.</p>
<p>Only they kept voting the same way, and lo and behold it&rsquo;s turning out just like the places they left.  Of course this leaves them positively flummoxed.  But they&rsquo;ll still never waver.  If anything it encourages the busybodies to double-down on their efforts.  Because we all know the real reason why leftist socialistic policies haven&rsquo;t yet succeeded.  They just haven&rsquo;t been properly implemented, that&rsquo;s all&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

		<p>The use of the label &#8220;Asian&#8221; is even more confusing than calling someone &#8220;European&#8221;.  Surely, for instance, someone might think there&rsquo;s a difference between a Swede and an Italian, for instance.  But on the continent of Asia, the differences are even more pronounced.<br>
After some digging, I found that the Asian man involved was named Yang Keovongphet, of Laotian descent.  I figured he was southeast Asian, as those from the north are not as violence- prone.</p>

		<p>Serial killer Ted Bundy abducted and murdered two women from Lake Sammamish State Park in July 1974.  I&rsquo;d rather take my chances with a dozen Bundys than even one of these worthless gang creeps.</p>

		<p>I can recall very well the very first instances of Oriental gangsters in the Chicago area making headlines. Ghost Shadows out of Hong Kong. Broke up a Mah Jong game with high stakes and stole all the money. Ghost Shadows were new in town and really made a name for themselves quick. NOT persons to be trifled with.</p>
<p>BEFORE THERE WAS MAFIA THERE WAS TONG IS HOW THE SAYING GOES!</p>
<p>A lot of these Chinese gangsters are also graduates of the Chinese version of the GULAG. Very rough customers and not afraid of anyone or anything.</p>

		<p>Yet another example of a crime story that I first see reported by MSNBC in which the race of those guilty is left for us to wonder about.  All I have to do is come to Amren and see that the same story is posted on here, and then it is confirmed as I guessed it from the start:  those guilty are minorities. </p>
<p>The mainstream media sure does jump through hoops to make it seem as if only whites are commiting crimes. </p>
<p>Once they get tired of reporting on white priests molesting children, white people kidnapping children 15 years ago, Times Square terrorists who they like to insist are white even when they are arab, white male athletes who &#8220;commit&#8221; sexual crimes that never even happened, or white male teenagers who are smart enough to steal airplanes, then maybe they will move on to the more common every day bloody crimes commited by minorities all over this country.  </p>
<p>I am not excusing the crimes commited by whites (especially those involving children), but the news media needs to start finding better, more realistic, crime stories to report on, as opposed to bringing up crimes commited by whites that happened 15 years ago etc&hellip;.</p>
<p>The CofCC website has an article up about a poor little white boy who was shred to pieces after a black car jacker grabbed him from his mother, stole their car, and dragged him for miles behind it as he drove it.  It is sickening to me that this stuff never makes the mainstream news.  Yet we have to keep hearing about white female actresses going to alcohol rehab or male white senators who might be having affairs, or better yet, white people hanging up nooses and leaving offensive cotton balls on the ground.</p>

		<p>I was visiting the Seattle area this weekend and by chance happened to be staying at the Motel 6 across the street from the park where this shooting took place. I and most of the other patrons of the hotel came out and stood on the balconies chatting and speculating on what had happened. We quickly learned there had been a shooting, resulting in at least one fatality, and every one of us agreed with the opinion that it was probably black gang members. Of course we were all white people but all ages and several locations across the state and the nation were represented. More and more &#8220;ordinary&#8221; white  folks are getting bold enough to say what they think about the  way minorities tend to behave.<br>
I must say that I am surprised to learn that it was &#8220;Asians&#8221; and not blacks, but it is a Seattle suburb.</p>

		<p>I lived an hour outside Seattle for 6 months in 1999.<br>
At the time I used to visit Seattle to meet friends and co-workers for outdoor social gatherings provided by the better restaurants in the  area.<br>
But after a few months our gatherings quietly dispersed because the locals and inparticular the youth population would become rowdy and overpopulate an area to near riot incidents.<br>
Although gangs were an anomaly and seen by a rare few it is clear to see how the growth of gangs was allowed to spread.<br>
Socialist politicians in Washington State and D.C. have been attacking the state with socialist weapons of taxation, inflation, and governmental regulation, while importing an incredible mix of nonwhites from as far as India and Samoa.</p>
