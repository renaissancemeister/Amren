<h1>Group Makes Push for Muslim School Holidays</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rebecca Spitz, NY1-TV, June 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of Muslim parents and their supporters gathered Wednesday on the steps of City Hall where they called on Mayor Michael Bloomberg to recognize Islamic holidays on the school calendar.</p>
<p>The coalition of religious, immigrant and labor groups is asking the mayor to honor a City Council resolution calling for two Muslim holy days  &mdash;  Eid-ul Adha and Eid-ul Fitr  &mdash;  to be added to the school calendar.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The group says the fact they were considering pushing back the first day of school to accommodate Rosh Hashanah indicates that there is flexibility in the system. They also say having no Islamic holidays discriminates against the city&rsquo;s 100,000 Muslim school children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twelve percent of the New York City&rsquo;s 1.1 million school children are Muslim. And our children deserve to have their holiday like everyone else,&#8221; said City Councilman Robert Jackson.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make our holiday like other people. We want to be equal like other people. It&rsquo;s not fair. We want to get our rights just like other people get their rights,&#8221; said one student.</p>

		<p>Actually, it is not about right but about privileges.</p>
<p>They want extra-holiday, they want mosques everywhere, they want be able to pray at work 5 times. They don&rsquo;t want to touch women or women having the clothes they want &hellip; and so on and so on.<br>
And the same time they want companies to take them in the same number as Christians.<br>
But even the most stupid Liberal must noticed that this can not work. Always the company which takes the smartest persons win. And if you force them to take the not smartest, you can be sure only the companies will survive who goes to another land where they are able to take the smartest guy. </p>

		<p>I live here. Don&rsquo;t worry. Bloomberg will give them whatever they want. He gives EVERY group whatever they want. EXCEPT for a <b>certain</b> group of people. (If only I could remember who they were. Wait - let me go look in the mirror. Maybe it&rsquo;ll come back to me.)&hellip;<br>

		<p>In 1987, Allan Bloom&rsquo;s &#8220;The Closing of the American Mind&#8221; was a huge best-seller. Bloom argues that our schools&rsquo; teaching of &#8220;openness&#8221; has resulted in &#8220;value relativism&#8221; (I&rsquo;m-okay-you&rsquo;re-okay wimpiness) and, ironically, a CLOSING of the American mind. At the same time, Reagan&rsquo;s Secretary of Education Secretary, William Bennett, said that multiculturalism in schools was &#8220;trashing Shakespeare&#8221;. </p>
<p>A quarter of a century later, we see the results of the post-civil rights era&rsquo;s demand for valuing ALL cultures equally. We have seen it happen in Europe already. We in America must be stalwart and stand our ground. </p>
<p>Teach Shakespeare and The Bible and the Great Books of Western Civilization. Teach our children that MLK plagiarized and womanized and was no defender of the Gospel, and teach them that George Washington was Noble and that once &hellip; long ago &hellip; we actually celebrated the latter&rsquo;s birthday and not the former&rsquo;s. Teach our children that Beethoven and Kanye West are not equally gifted. And above all  &mdash;  as this is ostensibly going to be a HUGE issue for us in the immediate future  &mdash;  teach them that you did not know any muslims while you were growing up in a thriving and prosperous United States that broke up the school year at Christmas and Easter and Memorial Day, and not Ramadan.</p>
<p>Happy 4th of July to all True Americans (excluding those who are just barnacles catching a free ride on our Great Super Ship).</p>

		<p>I wonder when they will demand to have 9/11 (the day of their victory over the Great Satan) declared a &#8220;holiday&#8221; in NYC? I am sure Bloomberg will be more then happy to oblige them.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s another issue. These proponents of muslim rights see all religions as equal. Thus, if Religion A gets a holiday it stands to reason that Religion B should get a holiday, and so on. Just because someone concluded that 12% of New York public school students are muslim doesn&rsquo;t mean muslims should automatically get anything.</p>
<p>The city councilman in the article, Robert Jackson (you can find him on YouTube) is your typical not-very-intelligent black political doofus who likes to hear himself talk. Here&rsquo;s a guy tasked with improving public education in a cash-strapped city and he wastes his time running around demanding more holidays. </p>
<p>And the comment from the activist, if less than transparent &#8220;coalition of religious, immigrant and labor groups&#8221; that &#8220;having no Islamic holidays discriminates against the city&rsquo;s 100,000 Muslim school children&#8221; is completely ridiculous. How is this discriminatory? How does this purposely keep muslim students from succeeding in school? </p>
<p>Besides, if those two holidays are so important the parents can keep little Abdul home and write him an excuse note.</p>
<p>But back to the main point. Religion A is not equal to religion B just because it is a religion. I find modern Christianity and Judaism entirely different than the toxic mix which makes up current Islamic believers. </p>
<p>This nation was founded on Christian beliefs, and by extension, Hebrew beliefs. This Judeo-Christian fabric was woven into American society over 200 years and stands as a pillar of this country&rsquo;s framework. It reflects many values which carry over into secular life. It does not stand for hatred, misogyny, death cults, and a 7th century world-view. </p>
<p>Rosh Hashana and Easter and Christmas are not the same as Eid-ul Adha and Eid-ul Fitr and these muslim holy days, in my opinion, do not deserve to be placed as holidays equivalent to the Christian holidays celebrated here since the 1700s. Doing so is giving tacit approval to an evil, anti-western, anti-American sect. For that reason alone the request should be dismissed out of hand.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the cowards in charge (like Bloomberg) will bow to the low IQ idiots (like Jackson) who take up causes at odds with what is truly important because they see everything as a form of discrimination. This is especially sad for blacks, who jump on the bandwagon of civil &#8220;rights&#8221; thinking it will help their cause by underlining the reasons for their failures. But this short-term gain only perpetuates their misery through misplaced energy. </p>

		<p>Well, thanks to American identity-politic scheming decades ago, we already have schools with Jewish Holidays and less than one percent Jewish populations, let alone the twelve percent(of Muslims)noted in this article. This is the dangerous and divisive nature of ethnic identity-politics - and you can&rsquo;t only make special rules for some! Welcome to multicult America - some wanted it&hellip;now we ALL live with it!!</p>

		<p>The majority religion in our country, Christianity, gets just one holiday off, Christmas (Easter is always on a Sunday).  And we&rsquo;re not even allowed to call it Christmas anymore, it&rsquo;s called The Holidays.  People with minority religions can do what the Jews did in my heavily Jewish high school   &mdash;   the Jewish kids could take the Jewish holidays off without penalty, but had to make up any work lost and take any tests scheduled for those days at some earlier time.  That policy didn&rsquo;t do the Jewish kids any harm and there was no need to add in an extra half a dozen official school holidays.  (I don&rsquo;t know exactly how many Jewish holidays there are but I learned that there are quite a few.)  Muslims can do the same thing.  And why did our foolish immigration policy leave us with a New York school system that is 12% Muslim?  I guarantee that if the Muslims do get their holidays that they will next complain that having school on Friday is discriminatory.</p>

		<p>Middle American wrote that &#8220;these Muslims see all religions as equal&#8221;.  Actually I believe most Muslims regard Islam as above all other religions; they are just getting a foothold here, using our freedom of religion against us to eventually eliminate all but Islam.  You doubt this?  Don&rsquo;t kid yourself.</p>

		<p>School holidays should occur on days that are convenient for teachers and students. If 12 percent of NY students are Muslim, then adding two more holidays to the school calendar makes perfect sense. It would also make sense for NY if Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur were school holidays&hellip; are they?</p>

		<p>I concur with Freedom Doc, <br>
Once Muslims achieve &#8216;critical mass&rsquo; in any country they will impose their religious laws. In our lifetimes we are bound to see countries like France and the UK have Muslims rampages like those seen in Nigeria, for example, where Christians are butchered. </p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;re bound and determined to create a multiculty society, then the only way to fend off  the demands of all of these contending religions is to have NO religious school holidays at all.  </p>
<p>Let them practice their own religions at home in their own ways on their own time. Let the schools be entirely secular. Otherwise,  what pleases one group inevitably offends another.</p>

		<p>I think this Muslim group is asking for these holidays simply to see if a Jew will cave in to a Muslim. If they want to keep their Muslim kids home on the holidays, fine. It&rsquo;ll just go down as an absence in the books. </p>
