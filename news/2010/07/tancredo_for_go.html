<h1>Tancredo for Governor  &mdash;  IT COULD HAPPEN</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bay Buchanan, Team America PAC, July 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I wanted to make sure you are aware that our Co-Chair, Tom Tancredo, is considering running for Governor of the State of Colorado.</p>
<p>It appears that due to circumstances that have developed in the last few weeks that neither of the two GOP candidates running in the August primary are any longer viable general election candidates. To make matters worse, the Democrat in this race is the big spending, open border, sanctuary city Mayor of Denver, John Hickenlooper.</p>
<p>Tom finds this situation so unacceptable that he has announced that he may seek the nomination of the American Constitution Party so as to give the people of Colorado a conservative alternative who will battle illegal immigration as hard as he battles the deficit spending.</p>
<p>As we have told you before  &mdash;  Tom and I will fight this battle of open borders wherever we can and Tom is certainly not going to let his home state fall into the hands of a pro-amnesty, sanctuary city mayor  &mdash;  NOT IF HE CAN STOP IT!</p>
<p>Be assured Team America will continue to support our great conservative, anti-amnesty candidates every possible way we can and, of course we will keep you up-to-date on this exciting development. Thanks for always standing with us,</p>
<p>Bay Buchanan<br>

								<h2>Tom Tancredo for Governor?</h2>
						<p>
							<i>The State Column, July 23, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Former Republican Congressman Tom Tancredo demanded on Thursday that the two GOP gubernatorial candidates drop out of the race.</p>
<p>Mr. Tancredo said if both candidates refuse to do so, he will run for governor as an American Constitution Candidate.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s nothing left to split. The reality is that with the two candidates we have, we will lose the general election,&#8221; Mr. Tancredo said.</p>
<p>He gave both candidates until noon on Monday to release public statements agreeing to his terms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Both the McInnis and Maes campaigns said they intended to stay in the race.</p>
<p>Colorado Republican Party Chairman Dick Wadhams released a statement on Thursday, saying he was &#8220;disappointed&#8221; that Mr. Tancredo &#8220;made a back room deal with a minor political party.&#8221; He went on to say Mr. Tancredo &#8220;wants to destroy Republican chances to win a governor&rsquo;s race&#8221; against Democrat John Hickenlooper.</p>

		<p>Why can&rsquo;t he run as a Republican?</p>
<p>Tancredo should have run for Governor of Colorado when he was a very popular Republican Congressman from Colorado.</p>
<p>His run for President of the United States like Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s run for President of the United States on the Reform party platform was a waste of time.</p>
<p>Third party runs have not been viable since the end of the US Depression.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know all the dynamics of the current Colorado governs race but I do agree that the problem for conservatives is that there are no viable conservative candidates.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t bore you with the NY governs race but of the two republican choices, one is a boring as watching paint dry and the other is running on a &#8220;I&rsquo;m as mad as hell&#8221; campaign and has some eyebrow raising personal issues which will likely damn him state wide.</p>
<p>Since there is no viable republican candidate, NY is likely going to elect the uber liberal Andrew Cuomo who has already said that he want to restore NY as the great liberal state it once was.</p>
<p>Conservatives have a dearth of charismatic leaders. Without anyone to inspire, Conservatives have no one to vote for and democrats win.</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t worship Reagan or his legacy, he had the charisma to inspire hope in conservatives and republics even if he was less than perfect. <br>

		<p>&#8220;Why can&rsquo;t he run as a Republican?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because the Party would make sure he wouldn&rsquo;t win the primary and I don&rsquo;t mean the people voting in the primary!</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;re on that subject, tell me what David Paterson has done so wrong that the ruling class media that should love him so much want to throw him to the wolves.  While I agree with him on little policy wise, I like Paterson personally   &mdash;   he and I are cut from the same snarky cloth.  And are any NYS Republicans that much better?  On the real important issues, no.  On our side issues, e.g. 2nd Amendment, no.  You&rsquo;ve heard the phrase &#8220;Rockefeller Republican?&#8221;  That phrase essentially came from Nelson Rockefeller&rsquo;s time as Governor of NY.  </p>
<p>If I were a NYer, I&rsquo;d realize I have no choice politically, so I&rsquo;d vote Paterson just to have an interesting personality.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t like the way Tom Tancredo is right in line with George W. Bush and John McCain in favoring the forever wars.  But that&rsquo;s irrelevant for a governor.  So run, Tom, run!<br>

		<p>I doubt very much that Tancredo would have a chance of winning.  Third party candidates are too often looked upon with suspicion and doubt.  If Tancredo is serious about awakening America&rsquo;s consciousness then he should run as an American Third Position (A3P) candidate.  I am a former Colorado resident and he would certainly get my vote in that circumstance.  Candidates need to quit pandering to the minority populations of this country.  You don&rsquo;t need their vote (especially Black America).  Take a stand Tom and go with A3P.    </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Tom Tancredo can win, but I have always found him to be a man of honor who consistently stands for the principles he believes, the very principles the people of this nation are yearning for (Constitutional government, enforcement of our immigration laws, small government, and the free market which adds up to  &mdash;   LIBERTY.  It sure seems like this could be Mr. Tancredo&rsquo;s time, and maybe this is our time as Republicans to be willing to take the risk to stand for what is right and trust God for the results.</p>

		<p>Those of you writing off Tancredo should recall that Jesse Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota on the Reform Party ticket. So it <i>can</i> be done.</p>
<p>Anon (#3) is right. The Colorado GOP establishment hates Tancredo and would stop at nothing to derail his candidacy.</p>
<p>I share WR the elder&rsquo;s (#5) disdain for Tancredo&rsquo;s warmongering. Unfortunately, that issue is <i>not</i> irrelevant for a governor. An antiwar governor would take steps to prevent the deployment of his state&rsquo;s National Guard units to Iraq or Afghanistan. If enough governors followed his example, it could throw a major monkey wrench into the war machine. The <a href="http://www.tenthamendmentcenter.com/" rel="nofollow">10th Amendment Center</a> has already weighed in on this topic.</p>
