			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carl Horowitz, Townhall, July 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Supporters call it &#8220;financial services reform.&#8221; Yet the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010 is far less about reform or stability than about central control over the ground rules of residential mortgage lending  &mdash;  and with a strong dose of racial entitlement. Its principal legacy may be an even worse rerun of the financial collapse of 2008.</p>
<p>By a 237-192 margin, the House of Representatives on June 30 passed the 2,300-plus-page conference bill which is designed to protect households from predatory practices by banks, subprime lenders, brokerages and other financial intermediaries. Yet in practice the measure is likely to invite a new generation of reckless lenders and unqualified borrowers. That&rsquo;s because during House-Senate conference sessions, affirmative action zealots managed to insert a series of mandates whose implicit intent is to lower credit standards for nonwhites so as to boost their rates of homeownership.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The driving force behind these amendments, by all accounts, is Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. Congresswoman Waters, a member of the conference committee and the Congressional Black Caucus, used her clout to ensure that the final package delivers a cartload of favors to black and Hispanic mortgage borrowers, not to mention lending institutions that cater to them. Investor&rsquo;s Business Daily recently surmised that the bill &#8220;could have been written by ACORN [the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now], and probably was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Congresswoman Waters disavows any intent to create quotas. In a response to a critical June 14 Wall Street Journal opinion piece, she argued: &#8220;The Journal mischaracterizes both the intent and the effects of the legislation. It is absolutely not an attempt to politicize the Fed or any other agency or to allocate credit by race and gender. Nothing in the bill mandates lending to minorities or women. The provision does not even mention lending.&#8221; Yet elsewhere in her response, she implicitly contradicted herself. &#8220;Analysis documents the discrimination that women and minorities face compared to white men of similar educational background and age,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;Data from the Office of Personnel Management shows the lack of African-American and Hispanic senior managers at the federal financial service agencies.&#8221; That&rsquo;s the language of affirmative action advocacy.</p>
<p>{snip} The measure, in addition to giving the U.S. Treasury the authority to liquidate banks that pose a threat to financial stability (a mixed blessing at best), all but exempts lenders from shutdown if black and other minority borrowers account for high portions of their loan portfolios, especially in minority neighborhoods. The bill states: &#8220;The orderly liquidation plan shall take into account actions to avoid or mitigate potential adverse effects on low-income, minority or underserved communities affected by the failure of the covered financial company.&#8221; In other words, federal bank examiners should make every effort to keep a failing institution open so long as it underwrites lots of mortgages to the kinds of borrowers instrumental to the disaster in the first place!</p>
<p>{snip} The amended bill would create a Financial Stability Oversight Council headed by the Secretary of the Treasury to consider a struggling financial institution&rsquo;s &#8220;importance as a source of credit for low-income, minority or underserved communities&#8221; before any takeover. The measure also would establish an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion within each of the Treasury Department, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, and the Federal Reserve System. Rep. Waters&rsquo; amendment is explicit: &#8220;Each agency shall take affirmative steps to seek diversity in the workplace of the agency, at all levels of the agency.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Civil rights leaders, not surprisingly, are complaining the new provisions don&rsquo;t go far enough. They want the proposed diversity offices to enforce standards, not just promulgate them. &#8220;This is absolutely necessary,&#8221; said National Urban League President Marc Morial of punitive sanctions. &#8220;The evidence shows we haven&rsquo;t overcome discrimination or the need to promote diversity or inclusion.&#8221; He added, ominously, &#8220;We have to make sure this agency has teeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perhaps activists should consult empirical evidence revealing nonwhite borrowers to exhibit high incidences of default and foreclosure. Here are several examples:</p>
<p>* Economists Richard Anderson (Jersey City State College) and James VanderHoff (Rutgers University-Newark), examining a data base of active conventional mortgages during 1986-92, concluded that black households have higher marginal default rates, even when controlling for borrower and property characteristics.</p>
<p>* The Department of Housing and Urban Development looked at more than 240,000 loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (Note: FHA is part of HUD) and underwritten during 1992-99, and found that whites, blacks and Hispanics had respective default rates of about 4 percent, 11 percent and 13 percent.</p>
<p>* In a lengthy 2007 report to Congress, the Federal Reserve System Board of Governors concluded that non-Hispanic whites and Asians posed lower risks of default than blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>* Two economists for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Kristopher Gerardi and Paul Willen, analyzing the breakdown of subprime mortgages underwritten during 1998-2006 in Massachusetts urban neighborhoods, found that black and Hispanic borrowers had far higher foreclosure rates than whites. Among loans made during 2005, for example, the portion of black, Hispanic and white ownerships ending in foreclosure by December 2007 were 15.0 percent, 10.3 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>* This past June, the Center for Responsible Lending, a Durham, N.C.-based research and advocacy group, released a nationwide study estimating that among borrowers who took out mortgages during 2005-08, 8 percent of blacks, 8 percent of Hispanics and only 4.5 percent of non-Hispanic whites lost their homes through foreclosure. Adding to the mix those households at risk of losing their homes, the respective figures were 11 percent, 17 percent and 7 percent.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t as if opponents of affirmative-action lending have remained silent. &#8220;Under the Waters provision,&#8221; noted Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., &#8220;financial regulators will be required to &#8216;assess the diversity policies&rsquo; of every single institution they oversee, including every credit union and community bank.&#8221; These offices, he complained. &#8220;will again lead to regulators shifting their focus away from systemic risks and safety and soundness. This time it will be toward racial and gender lending when inspecting the institutions they oversee.&#8221; Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and also a conferee, similarly argued that to make exceptions for minority neighborhoods would defeat the purpose of reform, which is to protect American consumers as a whole.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the end, what must change, even more than the affirmative action mentality, is the very idea of a moral right to homeownership. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} In absence of a Senate filibuster, Congress is about to lay the infrastructure for another mortgage lending collapse and bailout. And Maxine Waters&rsquo; mandates for &#8220;diversity&#8221; will make the next round worse. Lenders will have every reason to remain reckless. After all, who wants to be a target of a civil rights lawsuit?</p>

		<p>This is a brilliant initiative.  We&rsquo;re going to force banks to lend to minority deadbeats so we can have an exact replay of the mortgage banking collapse of 2008.</p>

		<p>Liberals will argue that it was the packaged loan ponzi scheme that triggered the financial meltdown in 2008.  While there is more than a kernel of truth to that theory, the bottom line is millions of mortgages were granted to people who had no right receiving them, and a great many of those were given to &#8220;borrowers of color.&#8221;  I fail to see how this next round of affirmative action loans will be any less toxic to the banks.</p>
<p>You really have to question the sanity and/or motives of these politicians.  Do they think they&rsquo;re playing with monopoly money?  Can they not realize where policies such as these will lead?  Are they purposely trying to run the system into the ground?<br>

		<p>This is wrong on every conceivable level.Part of the whole mortgage meltdown is the simple fact that many uncreditworthy blacks and hispanics received loans despite the fact that they were unqualified.Throw in federal pressure to lend and unscrupulous mortgage brokers and BANG.I personally know of blacks near my shop that were foreclosed on one year ago,house lay empty,they returned in June.They successfully sued the bank alleging predatory lending,got their house back and may yet receive a financial settlement.The worst case of mortgage fraud I read about was a migrant fruit picker (hispanic) who qualified for a $720000 loan despite an annual reported income of $14000.America has already been irreversibly changed.Shall we let it be ruined?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Next step will be lending quotas for non-whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what brought the country to economic ruin.  Though the predators in the loan business most certainly exacerbated the situation, the opportunity to manipulate unsound securities would have NEVER existed if loans were not given to unqualified people.</p>

The bright side (if there is one) is that after the next mortgage meltdown, the paper trail will be unambiguous as to what the cause was and who are the people responsible.</p>
<p>Knowing what&rsquo;s coming gives us an opportunity to protect our investments and downplay our risks.</p>

		<p>Back in the latter part of &#8216;08 when this was all blowing-up, I predicted that as soon as the dust settled somewhat, the very same forces would find new ways to start the SAME process all over again, ensuring a SECOND ROUND of similar financial meltdown tied directly to &#8220;minority&#8221; home-loans and government shenanigans that basically enforce them! This article essentially outlines exactly how it will happen - now it is only a matter of when. </p>
<p>We all knew that the forces whose sole mission is to cater to blacks and browns(primarily), would not allow a pesky global financial meltdown to get in the way of their &#8220;social justice&#8221; peddling, via cushy home-loans for people who haven&rsquo;t a hope of paying them back, or are so utterly irresponsible that they have no intention of making good on the loans one way or the other. </p>
<p>This grand race-racket spells the doom of not only America, but the white race itself, if we do not wake up and stop this lunacy once and for all!!</p>

		<p>Mandated mortgages to minorities with high default rates will be a hidden tax on Whites and Asians. The expenses from the defaulted mortgages will be  passed on to other mortgage borrowers via increased interest rates, fees and tougher lending rules for Whites and Asians. It is steath reporations.</p>

<p>Hit the nail on the head!  This has been going on since the 60&rsquo;s. Section 8 is another government mandate to go into White areas.<br>
  <br>
Desegregation and the &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; movement was the catalyst to destroy and enslave White Americans. Oh, wait, add the 1965 NON-White Immigration Act to the list. That has done so much harm to White America it is amazing to me that most Whites STILL refuse to see it!</p>

		<p>We know what the first level of the agenda is.  Do we know that it is the only level?</p>
<p>You see massive financial fraud and risking of an already insecure currency on additional defaulted banks.</p>
<p>What I see is the potential to buy up both banks and housing as cheap &#8216;real property&rsquo;, one of the few things left in the States.</p>
<p>Once the ownership of the debt has left the States, ownership of our culture via the collateral will mean a massive influx of foreign influence which will make today&rsquo;s &#8216;social engineering&rsquo; look like slapstick.</p>

		<p>Correct me if I am wromg, but doesn&rsquo;t the worldwide financial depression we currently face have its roots in minority mortgage lending?  And are we supposed to believe that more of the same is the cure? It would be absurdly funny if it wasn&rsquo;t so economically painful to everyone excepting our black masters.</p>

I remember that story.  He was a strawberry picker who got to move his family into a McMansion for several years before they were finally foreclosed.

		<p>This bill is mortgage affirmative action, the same nonsense that caused the mortgage market collapse in the first place.  It should be challenged by Whites as a violation of the Equal Protection clause of the constitution.  These are truely, &#8220;interesting times&#8221;.</p>
