			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David S Morgan, CBS News, July 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Bush appointee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights denounced allegations by some pundits that the Justice Department is refusing to pursue a voting rights case against members of the New Black Panther Party because of race, and suggested that the charges being made by right-wing figures are politically motivated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A recent Media Matters investigation has debunked charges that the Obama administration withdrew criminal charges against the Panthers (in fact, the Bush administration decided not to pursue criminal charges, with Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez testifying that the Bush Justice Department &#8220;determined that the facts did not constitute a prosecutable violation of the criminal statutes&#8221;; a civil lawsuit was filed in the last days of the Bush administration, and a judgment won by the Obama Justice Department in May 2009).</p>
<p>Media Matters also found no evidence that any voters in the predominantly-black voting district had been prevented from voting.</p>
<p>Appearing on CBS&rsquo; &#8220;Face the Nation&#8221; Sunday, the commission&rsquo;s vice chair, Abigail Thernstrom, said, &#8220;We have no direct evidence that [the NBP activists] actually intimidated anybody, stopped them from voting.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of Adams&rsquo; charges that DOJ is discriminatory in prosecution, Thernstrom said, &#8220;We certainly have no direct evidence that anybody in the Justice Department said &#8216;We&rsquo;re not going to prosecute this case because we have racial double standards: We protect blacks, we don&rsquo;t protect whites.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the evidence is extremely weak,&#8221; Thernstrom told anchor Bob Schieffer. &#8220;If the Justice Department chooses  &mdash;  and I would be delighted if it did so  &mdash;  to send to us, for instance, somebody who is at that alleged brown bag meeting in which [Deputy Assistant Attorney General] Julie Fernandez said, &#8216;We don&rsquo;t prosecute cases [against] blacks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rsquo; fine. I&rsquo;m an evidence girl, really. I want evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wall Street Journal columnist John Fund, also appearing on &#8220;Face the Nation,&#8221; argued that not all the facts are known, &#8220;because the Justice Department is stonewalling subpoenas issued by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two African-American poll watchers testified they were intimidated,&#8221; said Fund. &#8220;We saw testimony that the voters said they turned around and said they would came back; we don&rsquo;t know if they ever came back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fund said there was a pattern of &#8220;consistent politicization&#8221; in the Justice Department, listing examples of Voting Rights Act decisions in the South.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson said this and another racially tinged case, the media flap about Shirley Sherrod and Andrew Breitbart, are indicative of a deeper societal problem:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He called the misuse of racial issues in the media is damaging in a lot of ways: &#8220;These wounds are very close to the surface in America. When people take these issues and attempt to use them for political reasons, when they feed rage, they&rsquo;re doing something very, very dangerous. I think, you know, historically it&rsquo;s a real problem.&#8221;</p>

<p><br>
But there is prooof, through a video recording, that they were at least trying hard to intimidate voters, with their hateful slogans, dark uniforms and baseball bat. And isn&rsquo;t it that gesture itself, that counts, legally speaking? Or does a tribunal actually need testimonies of White people who&rsquo;d say they were intimidated by those Black Panthers, to convict them?<br>

		<p>He called the misuse of racial issues in the media is damaging in a lot of ways: &ldquo;These wounds are very close to the surface in America. When people take these issues and attempt to use them for political reasons, when they feed rage, they&rsquo;re doing something very, very dangerous. I think, you know, historically it&rsquo;s a real problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the MEDIA&rsquo;S fault!  Get it?  It&rsquo;s the media&rsquo;s fault for doing exactly what the liberal elites and blacks WANT them to do - keep race in the news.  Even when a glimmer of the truth comes out while they debunk black racism and sensationalize white racism where it doesn&rsquo;t exist.  His main objection though, reading between the lines, is that awareness may turn to violent rage on the part of whites.  It was OKAY whenever awareness prompted blacks to riot, kill, terrorize and destroy over some petty issue inflamed by the media.  That was okay.  Whites aren&rsquo;t blacks and we don&rsquo;t act out like blacks.  But that&rsquo;s his fear.  Having seen (and gleefully approved ) black rioting, he fears whites will do the same.  Ain&rsquo;t happening.  We have other ways to resolve our issues beginning with the elective process.  Beginning with organized civil disobedience.  And ending, if necessary, in organized means advocated in the Declaration of Independence and implied in the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right though.  It IS dangerous what the media is doing.  And what the blacks are having them do.  White eyes are opening.  White hearts are beating White again.  Whites are about fed up and at the end of their patience with Blacks, and with the race hustle.  Not because the media is exposing the scam perpetrated on them for decades.  But because it has gotten so blatant, so silly, so often used, and so violent that Whites - even the blinded libtard indoctrinated Whites - see the scam for what it is and are just about to dismantle the entire structure one way of the other.<br>

		<p>Video evidence and testimony of intimidated (would-be) voters is not evidence? Balderdash.</p>
<p>If a White Man passes gas that sounds racist, the DOJ assembles a task force and pays federal informants to entrap someone for a show trial.  Everyone knows the DOJ &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; division exists solely for the benefit of blacks and non-Whites.</p>
<p>White Man, are you angry yet? </p>

		<p>Ignoring racial problems won&rsquo;t make them go away.  In fact, nothing will.  The best the government can do is to strive for consistency in the treatment of all ethnicities.  And everyone knows what would have happened if white separatists had been parading in front of a polling place.</p>

<p>So I gather he must be talking about the NAACP,CBC, &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Al $harpton, &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Je$$ie Jack$on, &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Wright, &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Farrakhan! That paragraph discribes them to a &#8220;t&#8221;.</p>

There&rsquo;s no proof if you don&rsquo;t look for it.</p>
<p>If whites had stood at the entrance to a polling station with clubs, in paramilitary uniform, telling voters they&rsquo;re about to elect a white president, it would have been seen as an act of intimidation regardless of how serious the white men were to be taken.</p>
<p>It was racial intimidation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see two white men repeat this action following the same script during the next presidential election and see what action the DoJ and CCR take. </p>

<p>Of course there&rsquo;s no proof that anybody in the justice department said &#8220;that&#8221;, it was probably worded differently.</p>

		<p>Media Matters investigating racial double standards at the Justice Department is like having John Dillinger head investigations into bank robberies.</p>

<p>When whites are smeared the media jumps on the bandwagon and fans the flames. But when the darlings of the left are caught with their hand in the cookie jar they call it a &#8220;misuse of racial issues&#8221;. The double standard is nauseating.</p>

		<p>Now that it&rsquo;s been shown that the law isn&rsquo;t going to do anything against them, we know what will happen at the next presidential election. There will be even more Black Panthers armed with baseball bats at even more polling places, intimidating even more White voters. </p>

		<p>This &#8220;ack of proof&#8221; is a circular argument that would embarass any child over the age of 8.  The Obstruction-Of-Justice Department isn&rsquo;t interested in doing its job and proving the case, thus there is &#8220;lack of proof&#8221;.</p>
