<h1><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/07/12/governors-obamas-immigration-suit-toxic/">Governors: Obama&rsquo;s Immigration Suit Is &#8216;Toxic&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, July 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Democratic governors expressed &#8220;grave&#8221; concerns to White House officials this weekend about the Obama administration&rsquo;s suit against Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration law, warning it could cost the party in crucial elections this fall, The New York Times reported late Sunday.</p>
<p>The closed-door meeting took place at the National Governors Association in Boston on Saturday, according to two unnamed governors who spoke to the Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Universally the governors are saying, &#8216;We&rsquo;ve got to talk about jobs, and all of a sudden we have immigration going on,&rsquo;&#8221; Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee, a Democrat, was quoted as saying. &#8220;It is such a toxic subject, such an important time for Democrats.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Attorney General Eric Holder, meanwhile, said on CBS&rsquo; &#8220;Face the Nation&#8221; Sunday that the federal government was leading with its &#8220;strongest&#8221; argument in the suit filed Tuesday and would not rule out a second suit months down the road  &mdash;  if the law ends up going into effect.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court in Arizona claimed the state was infringing on federal immigration responsibilities and urged the judge to prevent the law from going into effect at the end of July. Despite some officials&rsquo; claims that the law could lead to racial profiling, that concern was not cited as grounds for the suit.</p>
<p>Rallying around Gov. Brewer at the Boston meeting, Republican Gov. Dave Heineman of Nebraska told the Times: &#8220;I&rsquo;d be willing to bet a lot of money that almost every state in America next January is going to see a bill similar to Arizona&rsquo;s.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Beware the semantics here.  What the unnamed Democrat Governors (as it turns out, one is MD&rsquo;s Martin O&rsquo;Malley) mean by this is that it creates blowback for the Obama White Hosue to sue AZ and to push for open amnesty in public.  What they are advising Obama to do is to salami-slice their way to a full amnesty, or essentially enact it through the back door by refusing to enforce immigration law.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not on our side.</p>

		<p>Immigration is more than a single issue.  It cuts across employment, language, culture, history, health, taxes, education, security and identity.</p>
<p>The govenors want to &#8220;talk about jobs&#8221;, in other words, stick to simple, unequivocal subjects like motherhood and apple pie.  </p>
<p>They decry how terribly tedious it is for them to have to take a stand which will draw the ire of a lot of people, or alien them from corporate financial supporters.</p>

<p>Obama told Governor Jan Brewer that the border is kept unsecured as a bargaining chip for mass amnesty (&#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221;).  </p>
<p>Just wishful thinking as a political reality, but this is an impeachable offense in my eyes.  Using the nation&rsquo;s physical and economic security as a hostage to ram through a treasonous policy of racial genocide via ethnic cleansing.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s about time the average citizen takes control to save this country.  What can the shadowy affirmative action president do if a critical mass of US citizens do not support what he is doing?  Matter of fact, he should be impeached for not doing his duty to uphold the laws of this country and to protect it from massive invasion.  There is no difference between whether the invaders did not use guns to take over this country.  </p>

		<p>It was the managed mass immigration of whites from Europe that initially turned America into the world&rsquo;s leading economic powerhouse.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s economic decline today exactly parallels America&rsquo;s unprecedented inundation with parasitic Hispanic illegals and alien job thieves here on work visas.</p>
<p>Replace the Hispanics and imported Muslims, Indians, Red Chinese and blacks with European whites and America will prosper once again&hellip;</p>

		<p>Any state that doesn&rsquo;t pass an AZ law will be subject to an influx of illegals, so there will definitely be pressure to pass similar statutes.  <br>
I can&rsquo;t figure what Obama is thinking by his continuing actions that erode white support.  He can&rsquo;t win his own reelection without it and is slated to lose at least the House in Nov.  His unwavering support of Holder, especially in the Panthers intimidation case, is the most baffling to me.  It looks as if he has decided that he can&rsquo;t beat whitey, so he&rsquo;ll just keep poking him in the eye as long as possible.</p>

<p>1.) It was House Republicans that stopped neo-conservative W. Bushes insane amnesty push!</p>
<p>2.) With the Tea Party Movement Republicans are moving considerably farther to the Right.  Are they they were Amren and the Council of Conservatives are at right now&hellip; no they are not but things ARE trending that way.  </p>

<p>While many Republicans are traitors on the illegal immigration issue there is a much higher percentage of Republicans in favor of enforcing immigration law than there is of Democrats.  Democrats see a massive influx of poor non-whites as their best chance of becoming a permanent majority party.</p>
<p>The <i>real</i> taboo subject:  Slashing legal immigration.  I don&rsquo;t know of a single elected congressman willing to take that position.  Remember, we get over one million <i>legal</i> immigrants each year, most non-white.  And then they have kids.<br>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that these criminal racketeers are all Hispanics.</p>
<p>Visit any Social Security office in America and the majority of customers are young Hispanics with children in tow.  </p>
<p>They are scamming the Social Security Disability program which allows them to rob the taxpayers of more money every month than a degreed professional earns.  </p>
<p>Amnesty for illegals would allow tens of millions of new Hispanic scammers to bleed the taxpayers dry.  </p>
<p>These amnestied illegals would single-handedly destroy the Social Security program and this is exactly what congress wants&hellip;</p>

		<p>When we had no welfare state, immigration was self regulating. Every immigrant was a net gain to the country&rsquo;s wealth.</p>
<p>With the welfare state, immigrants who supply only raw labor are a loss.<br>
Since we cannot roll back the welfare state - any most Americans believe we should not - there is clearly a limit as to the level and mix of immigrants this country can support.</p>
<p>Mexican labor, being nearly entirely raw labor, is in excess supply.<br>
We need to remove the incentives for this excess supply.</p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s law is good, but more work needs to be done on preventing Americans from hiring illicit labor.</p>
