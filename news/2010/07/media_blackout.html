<h1><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jul/2/media-blackout-for-black-panthers/">Media Blackout for Black Panthers</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Washington Times, July 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Where is the New York Times? Where is The Washington Post? Where are CBS and NBC? A whistleblower makes explosive allegations about the Department of Justice; his story is backed by at least two other witnesses; and the allegations involve the two hot-button issues of race and of blatant politicization of the justice system. A potential constitutional confrontation stemming from the scandal brews between the Justice Department and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. A congressman highly respected for thoughtfulness and bipartisanship has all but accused the department of serious impropriety. By every standard of objective journalism, this adds up to real news.</p>
<p>Or it would be real news if a Republican Justice Department stood accused. It would be real news if the liberal media weren&rsquo;t mostly in the tank for our celebrated but failing first black president.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, the Civil Rights Commission will hear long-awaited testimony from J. Christian Adams, who resigned from the Voting Section of the Justice Department after the department improperly ordered him to refuse compliance with the commission&rsquo;s lawful subpoena. Mr. Adams first told his story in public in these pages on June 28 and later did two major interviews with Fox News&rsquo; Megyn Kelly. In those appearances, he flatly accused the Obama Justice Department of adopting an unlawful, immoral policy identified in previous Washington Times editorials  &mdash;  namely, enforcing civil rights laws against white perpetrators who victimized minorities but never against black perpetrators who victimize whites or Asians. If this is indeed the policy, it makes a scandalous mockery of the cherished American principle of &#8220;equal justice under the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If the department&rsquo;s motives are not racial or racist, Justice officials surely appear political. One of the Black Panthers against whom the department declined to press charges was an official poll watcher for the Democratic Party and an elected local party official. The department dropped charges just four days before another election, allowing him again to serve as a poll watcher.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On a parallel track, The Washington Times has reported strong circumstantial evidence suggesting that department officials may have consulted the White House before dismissing the case. That possibility, too, cries out for investigation.</p>
<p>These broad policy questions and suggestions of political chicanery are important. Do we have a nation of laws equally applied to all, or is justice being reduced to raw politics? Investigating such questions is the essence of the news business. Failure to look into such a scandal is evidence of the institutional corruption of the much-ballyhooed &#8220;fourth branch of government,&#8221; a supposedly independent media.<br>

<p><br>
There is another way of taking those questions&hellip;..as the profitability and viewship of those insitutions flatlines, they won&rsquo;t be able to stay in businesss for very much longer.</p>
<p>And they are pretty irrelevant.  Most people know about this issue.  Most people are asking themselves why it wasn&rsquo;t in the mainstream news.  Few people care much about the Black Panthers.  They didn&rsquo;t get away with much.  But we do care about the media blackout.</p>
<p>What I am saying is most people are aware that we are under a totalitarian anti-white bananna republic where the rule of law is very weak in many places.  But most people are ALSO aware of the weakness of that system&hellip;.that it is collapsing and perhaps will create a power vaccuum soon.</p>
<p>Smart people are moving to areas of the country where they are best positioned to take advantage of the developing situation and avoid the negatives&hellip;.away from concentrations of non-whites, towards those areas still doing well despite the Obama depression.</p>
<p>When the end comes for the federal government, these will be the new centers of power.  The places that feel the least disruption, recover the quickest and get the most say in what comes next.</p>
<p>The best situation is to live among large numbers of whites, with strong conservative values, and believe in being well armed and prepared for disasters.  Look for those areas where flooding happened recently and the local white population shrugged and dealt with it.  Good, salt of the earth, religions people.  Places where laws are very strict for violent crime (3 strikes your out) castle doctrines are in place and concealed carry (or even open carry) are a way of life.  Places where people will pull together.</p>
<p>Make yourself valuable to them.  Tie yourself with friendship and fellowship to those communities.</p>

<p>The question is clearly rhetorical, but needs rephrasing all the same.  &#8220;Justice,&#8221; amerikan-style, is being reduced to raw anti-White racism.  Even the <i>Times</i>, as laudable as this article is, dares not go quite that far.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Or it would be real news if a Republican Justice Department stood accused. It would be real news if the liberal media weren&rsquo;t mostly in the tank for our celebrated but failing first black president.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Almost, but not quite.  It would be real news if a <i>White president&rsquo;s</i> Justice Department stood accused.  The issues are <i>racial</i>, not political.<br>

		<p>Eric Holder was quite blunt when he said YT does not have civil rights protections.  If a white AG had said blacks don&rsquo;t have civil rights protections he would have been hounded out of office.  It is the old double standard.  But I do give Mr. Holder credit for his candor.</p>

<p>And it would be real news if a couple of white dudes showed up in militia type uni&rsquo;s wielding weapons and were designated as &#8220;Tea-Baggers&#8221;. Btw, I don&rsquo;t think this hypocrisy and double standard has anything to do with Obama being &#8220;black&#8221;, what&rsquo;s more at play here is the so-called &#8220;mainstream news media&#8221; being in the back pocket of the Democrat Party. They would have been just as silent about this if Obama had been white.</p>

		<p>The national news media is following a well-trodden path, that of studiously failing to cover negatives associated with race and diversity.</p>
<p>The premiere example may be the Duke lacrosse rape hoax. Below are excerpts of the C-Span BookTV.org presentation of Stuart Taylor, a contributing editor of Newsweek, on his UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injusticed of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case.  Taylor zeroes in on the New York Times, where was Supreme Court reporter for eight years:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;The first New York Times reporter on the case, a fellow named Joe Drape, who covered horse races, but who was doing a very good job on this case actually &hellip; he &hellip; reported Nifong&rsquo;s statements the first couple of days.  They dominated his stories  &mdash;  as they should have, that was the news event.  But then he started talking to the defense lawyers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the defense lawyers told me that Joe Drape called him ten times &hellip; Well, that may be more times than the entire rest of the national media spent calling the defense lawyers combined over the first month of the case &hellip; but Joe Drape at the New York Times did it and he wrote stories reporting the defense theories and reporting them in an open way &hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The defense lawyers &hellip; got together and said this guy is being fair &hellip; Let&rsquo;s give him all of our evidence &hellip; Maybe he&rsquo;ll turn this around with a big story in the New York Times.  </p>
<p>&ldquo;They give him the evidence, wait for the big story.  Joe Drape calls a few days later and says, I&rsquo;m sorry that the story about your evidence isn&rsquo;t going to run.  I&rsquo;m having problems with editors.  Joe Drape&rsquo;s byline disappears &hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new reporter comes on the case who&rsquo;s much more willing to give the editors what they apparently wanted, which was the same guilt-presuming, don&rsquo;t-bother-us-with-the-defense side that the rest of the national media was doing.  And when I say the rest, I mean USA Today, The Washington Post (although it didn&rsquo;t do much), the Los Angeles Times (although it got better later), all of the major networks &hellip; the Durham Herald-Sun which was shameful throughout, Nancy Grace, who was mind-bogglingly shameful throughout &hellip; </p>
<p>&ldquo;The national news media ignored, largely, the evidence.  For example, when the DNA evidence came out that did what the prosecution said would prove innocence on April 10  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m not talking about the private DNA, but the state DNA &hellip; The New York Times reporter Duff Wilson wrote a little story: Well, the defense says it proves this and that and then he called Peter Neufeld of the Innocence Project, who is a great authority on DNA and quoted him in a way that made it sound like he was saying: Well, this doesn&rsquo;t really prove anything. Not every rape has DNA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;This struck me as odd so I called Neufeld  &mdash;  through his spokesman at the Innocence Project  &mdash;  and I said, &ldquo;Why did he say that? &hellip; Didn&rsquo;t he know the facts of the case, that the woman claimed she was raped for a half an hour by three men, three orifices, no condoms, beating, kicking, strangling  &mdash;  and no DNA?  And you&rsquo;re saying it [no DNA match] doesn&rsquo;t prove anything?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The answer was that Neufeld was told nothing about the facts of the case by the New York Times reporter and so the question basically to Neufeld was: Is it possible that you might some day have a rape that didn&rsquo;t leave DNA evidence?  Well, sure it&rsquo;s possible.  But not this rape.  But Neufeld didn&rsquo;t know that.  And that was not untypical of the way the media covered the story  &mdash;  and for months and months and months they covered it that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Newsweek, which had maybe been too credulous at first, to their credit &hellip; [had] the first major piece tearing the cover off of this &hellip; So there were good journalists out there &hellip; But in the face of all this &hellip; The New York Times does its definitive revisiting of the story on August 25 of &lsquo;06  &mdash;  MONTHS after anybody in the media who wanted to look at the evidence realized that it leaned strongly toward no rape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well the New York Times&rsquo; 5600-word article kind of boiled down to: Well, we looked at the evidence and, you know, defense lawyers, they kind of play games &hellip; and then there ARE weaknesses in the case but we think it looks like &hellip; a case you can take to trial. Not a bad case.  It was an astonishingly slanted piece of writing &hellip; It reported a lot of the evidence of the defense, but it minimized them, it put them in a context that suggests: Well, that doesn&rsquo;t really amount to anything, and it took some things as probative of guilt that anyone who knew anything about the case would know perfectly well was not probative of guilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say enough critical about their coverage &hellip; After the spectacular expose in open court on December 15 of the prosecution-DNA lab conspiracy to suppress evidence of the multiple male DNA  &mdash;  After that the New York Times finally started saying: Gee, you know, maybe there&rsquo;s a problem here.  But there was a problem long before that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At some point in the next two to four years, depending on how fast break up occurs, these media geeks are going to have to answer for their failure to report on many incidents like this, which reveals an unequivocal anti-white hatred.  Their yellow journalistic standards have caused the deaths of white people, because whites were not informed of anti-white situtions that have occurred  quite frequently throughout the country&hellip;..and of course still do&hellip;&hellip;..and the many anti-white racist violence by blacks against whites.  How many black on white mob attacks could have been prevented if the media correctly reported the epidemic of black on white violence, and the media accomplices in the schools who refuse to tell the truth or fail to report such incidents at all, or, worse yet, try to smooth the incident over as &#8220;overzealous youths?</p>
<p>Though there are still about 40% of dull-witted, cowardly whites who give the community organizer a good job approval rating, the other 60% are either waking up or are in full defense mode against this black, anti-white hater. These afore-mentioned incidents and those like the Henry Gates incident and the call for amnesty are dreams come true for many of us.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s causing an awakening that could never have occurred if John McCain had been elected.  </p>

		<p>This is one more example of the anti-white institutionalized racism  that has been part of government since the late 1960s.  It is now OK to insult, intimidate, and prevent whites from voting (in clear violation of the Voting Rights Act).  But the anti-white discrimination occurs in every personnel department, thanks to affirmative action.  Even the government&rsquo;s crime statistics are skewed, as Hispanic perps are usually categorized as white.  The media, and academia, prefer to ignore such discrimination, but if they must comment, they will dismiss the case.<br>
A previous director of the Civil Rights Commission, appointed by Democrats, Mary Francis Berry, once declared that civil rights did not apply to whites.  That is probably the view of Attorney General Holder, and his boss.  &mdash;    &mdash;  -Hugh Murray </p>

		<p>To someone who had not ever lived in the US, and depended on American TV for his information, they would come here believing that blacks were intelligent, well spoken, and would do anything to help out the poor, stupid whites.  So&hellip;perhaps they would choose to live close to these benevolent blacks, not realizing that they had about a 75% chance of having a violent crime committed against them.  Why can&rsquo;t the media portray blacks as they really are?  Why are the only times you hear about the violent, criminal side of them  is on the evening news, when the go through the list of murders, shootings, and other crimes?<br>
We who have lived near them, or went to school with them, or worked with them, know the reality.  But to speak it is racism&hellip;<br>
