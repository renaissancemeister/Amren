			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Youngman, The Hill, July 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama waded into the national race debate in an unlikely setting and with an unusual choice of words: telling daytime talk show hosts that African-Americans are &#8220;sort of a mongrel people.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When asked about his background, which includes a black father and white mother, Obama said of African-Americans: &#8220;We are sort of a mongrel people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean we&rsquo;re all kinds of mixed up,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s actually true of white people as well, but we just know more about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The president&rsquo;s remarks were directed at the roots of all Americans. The definition of mongrel as an adjective is defined as &#8220;of mixed breed, nature, or origin,&#8221; according to dictionary.com.</p>
<p>Obama did not appear to be making an inflammatory remark with his statement and the audience appeared to receive it in the light-hearted manner that often accompanies interviews on morning talk shows.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama noted &#8220;there&rsquo;s still a reptilian side of our brain&#8221; that leads people to not trust others &#8220;if somebody sounds different or looks different.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If anyone would know about being a &#8220;mongrel&#8221; it would surely be Obama, wouldn&rsquo;t it? General usage of the term has always denoted someone of mixed race. Whites may be a mix of other whites but they are hardly mongrels. I think Obama, being neither fish nor fowl, so to speak defines the term mongrel with his persona. I also think those of mixed race often have emotional and or mental problems because they can&rsquo;t fully identify with any one race. I didn&rsquo;t vote for Obama because I thought he would have mental problems. Turns he does. He hates traditional America and is doing his damnest to change it, isn&rsquo;t he?</p>

		<p>Blacks are a mongrel people? Well, whites certainly intermarry far more frequently on an inter-ethnic basis.  Italians marry Irish, English marry Poles, Hispanics marry rednecks, hell, everybody marries everybody in the US.  Except whites marrying blacks.  It happens but rather infrequently.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re certainly far more of a mongrel race than black Africans, simply because it&rsquo;s a rare white who feels attracted to blacks.</p>

		<p>Liberals and Democrats always play the race card. That&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s always been and it&rsquo;s not going to change. They have no solid, researched stance anyway. </p>
<p>This is why I was disappointed in O&rsquo;Reilly using that blogger&rsquo;s snippets without researching it himself. That&rsquo;s one thing Conservatives have over the rest. They can back up what they say. I don&rsquo;t say anything without being able to sight where I got the information or why I have an opinion.</p>
<p>Keep the unknowing focused on the ongoing race issue to cover up what Obama&rsquo;s really doing (or just let women see that charming President on their favorite show). Typical.</p>

		<p> A nation is an aggregation of persons of the same ethnic family, often speaking the same language or cognate languages. I guess in the new blade runner environment we are living in with &ldquo;sort of a mongrel people.&rdquo;, making up the population we are more like a tower of Babel than a nation.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell how Obama&rsquo;s remark was received among blacks, but whites will hear little, if any, public criticism.  Blacks, of course, are almost always proud of any white blood they have, often knowing about a particular great-great-grandfather who was a white man.  Light skin always has been a premium and still is.<br>
Everytime I hear the word &#8220;mongrel&#8221; I think of a black man I once worked with in a large city.  He was intelligent and well informed about most matters.  But once, when we were discussing dogs, he asked me what breed mine is.  When I said, &#8220;Oh, she&rsquo;s just a mongrel&#8221;, he remarked that he&rsquo;d never heard of &#8220;that breed&#8221;!</p>

		<p>I think that Obama was trying to make a point about the supposed &#8220;mongrel&#8221; status of Blacks being attributable to the plantation owners and their sons who according to the current version of history, had an out of control lust for Black slave women and spent most of their time raping them.<br>
I would offer that although that may have happened, I&rsquo;m confident that there were more than a few women who willingly engaged in liasons with the &#8220;Masters&#8221; in order to obtain some special privileges. <br>
I have no regard for the slave owners who, due to their greed, refused to pay impoverished White Southerners to work their plantations and as a result, left their descendants and the rest of White America to deal with the monster that they created.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m wondering a bit how this went over with the black community, I had a few black friends in college and other than one who had a white grandmother none of the other blacks I knew talked about their ethnic origins like the Asian and Hispanic and white friends I had (I knew Italian-Americans, Chinese-Americans, Puerto Rican-Americans, Jewish-Americans) - but the African Americans never knew what &#8220;mix&#8221; they were, just African-Americans.</p>
<p>Perhaps Obama feels different because he actually knows what country in Africa his father is from - which actually serves to further distance himself from the African-American community in this country.  Not only was he raised by his white grandparents, not only did he go to Harvard, not only has he never experienced any level of poverty - but his ancestors weren&rsquo;t brought to this country on slave ships.  And I know blacks think about that, and the more I hear Obama speak about race the more I think that it effects him on some level also - he knows in many ways his &#8220;racial&#8221; experience in this country was closer to the average upper class whites than the average African Americans.  A mongrel people?  Again, I&rsquo;m wondering how that&rsquo;s going over in the black community.</p>

		<p>Compare the words of Teddy Roosevelt to those of Obama.  Compare the character of Teddy Roosevelt to that of Obama.  Teddy Roosevelt was a real man.  He was a distinguished combat veteran who fought for and loved this country with all his heart and soul.  Compare that to comrade Obama&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin. But this is predicated upon the man&rsquo;s becoming in very fact an American, and nothing but an American.&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn&rsquo;t an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag, and this excludes the red flag, which symbolizes all wars against liberty and civilization, just as much as it excludes any foreign flag of a nation to which we are hostile&hellip;We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language&hellip;and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Every immigrant who comes here should be required within five years to learn English or to leave the country, English should be the only language taught or used in the public schools.  It is our boast that we admit the immigrant to full fellowship and equality with the native-born. In return we demand that he shall share our undivided allegiance to the one flag which floats over all of us.&#8221;<br>

<p>I do not want to sound like an old-fashioned Southern segregationist, but I feel very strongly about the issue of miscegenation. Race-mixing is a crime against God, and a crime against humanity. There is no greater crime a human being can commit, than to bring a mulatto into this world. Miscegenation is a crime that is worse than slavery.</p>
<p>Blacks and whites were designed by evolution to have two completely different natures. I do not necessarily believe that whites are better humans than blacks. Yes, whites are more intelligent, and are better able to create technologically advanced societies. Whites are superior to blacks when judged by white standards of behavior. But blacks are superior to whites when judged according to black value systems. I have an evangelical Christian cousin who has done missionary work in African villages. While those villages are extremely poor, the blacks in those villages are happy, peaceful, friendly, and mostly free of crime, and they are nothing like the violent blacks you see in American inner cities.</p>
<p>The reason why blacks in America are so angry, is because white Americans have attempted, since the 1950s, to turn black Americans into white people. When blacks fail to meet white standards of academic achievement, sexual morality, and financial self-discipline, they lash out in rage. What would you do, if somebody tried to forcibly turn you into a NBA player, despite the fact that you lack the natural talent for such an athletic feat?</p>
<p>To make matters worse, when miscegenation takes place between whites and blacks, the resulting offspring become people that have inherited incompatible racial instincts of two radically different sub-species of man. Some of you may have heard of a creature known as a geep, which is produced by mating a goat with a sheep. It is a completely unnatural creature that displays behavioral problems, that do not conform to either goat or sheep behavior: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep%E2%80%93goat_chimera" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep%E2%80%93goat_chimera</a></p>
<p>When whites produce mulattos, they produce people who are more intelligent than blacks, but find themselves unable to fit into either the white world or the black world. Their sense of alienation from both worlds, causes them to seek the destruction of both the white and the black worlds. The mulattos reserve their greatest hatred for whites, when living in majority white societies, because whites had the greatest responsibility of bringing their anguished and pain-filled lives into existence. Mulattos pose a far greater threat to the survival of whites than blacks, because of their greater intelligence, and their ability to lead and organize blacks to do battle with whites.</p>
<p>It should be the responsibility of every true Christian, and every person of conscience, to speak out against miscegenation. It should not matter whether one is a conservative or a liberal. Bringing mulattos into this world makes life a living hell for those people. If some renegade dog breeder was conducting experiments, breeding radically incompatible breeds of dogs, such as dalmatians and scottish terriers, he would have his license revoked. If we are capable of showing such compassion for dogs, what about humans?</p>
<p>Whites created mulattos and mestizos, the racial hybrids that pose the greatest threat to the future of white Americans. Whites bred their racial enemies into existence. We should end the taboo on speaking out against race-mixing, in order to prevent whites from breeding more of their hybrid racial enemies into existence.    </p>

		<p>Black genetics are actually far more inbred than whites which is to say that in Africa, for whatever reason, local populations did not or could not branch out and interbreed, despite constant internecine tribal warfare.</p>
<p>Perhaps the key to our existence is that we are nativiely gregarious travelers and explorers with an inherent revulsion for insularism.</p>
<p>Whites however, despite what is often stated, have -very few- haplotype markers from other races, despite constant invasions out of Asia and the Middle East throughout the early first and second millennia.  This is particularly notable in places like Poland and Czechoslovakia where there should in fact be huge numbers of them.</p>
<p>There may well be more truth to the &#8216;one drop&rsquo; rule than many want to admit and it may well be instinctive affinity within pop group and culture that has helped keep us from &#8216;mongrelizing&rsquo; to the point that we achieved more than any other society on the planet.</p>
<p>Which brings us to so-called &#8216;hybrid vigor&rsquo;, often noted in plant and animal breeders.  By which those specimens who have low genetic similarity often seem to have &#8216;the best of both parents&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What is often not noted however is the _hybrid slump_ which inevitably happens within 1-2 generations because the gene markers for certain skills and abilities **diminish** when you defacto replace them with others and lacking similar recombinant DNA fail to improve or reinforce.  Indeed, genetic -vulnerabilities- (to certain diseases etc.) in fact increase.</p>
<p>Add to this that almost 85% of genetic hybrids end up breeding with other hybrids because they cannot find a place among either of their parent races and you once again have a diminishing resource pool by which to prevent, gasp, inbreeding and the loss of potent parent group genes becomes even greater with continued dilution.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that this is exactly why the white gene pool has remained so clean.  We literally find no place for the _child&rsquo;s_ genes in the breeding population of surviving indigene peoples.  And so pass out of the fire of many defeats and incursions without being sullied or &#8216;improved&rsquo; by the invader genes.</p>
<p>Only in the modern, socially engineered, regimes is miscegenation deemed a &#8216;good thing&rsquo; without comment for how &#8216;environmental&rsquo; factors can be affecting genetic expressions.</p>
<p>Whites are cold, Blacks are &#8216;warm&rsquo;.  Blacks make Whites cold with disappointment and a lack of affinity group identification.  Thus whites don&rsquo;t express the warmth that our parents and grandparents did in denying the reality of prejudice and the need for exclusivity in controlling social resources.</p>
<p>Because theirs&rsquo; was a richer world.  And an innocent one.</p>
<p>Which never saw the burgeoning horrors of multi-cult disaster tearing our _country_ apart.  And threatening the EXTINCTION of our Nation.</p>

		<p>There are no pure social categories of any kind. Everyone is mixed or mongrel to varying extents. Whether it is race, religion, language, nationality, social class, political party, degree of education, occupation, etc. you are going to find variety, change, and trends among human categories. Sometimes groups lose their focus and dissipate out of existence, and sometimes they become more focused and enforce sameness among members. Obama is playing the old trick of deconstructing whiteness so as to weaken white identity and resolve. We can just as easily argue that whites should strengthen our white group focus since we will benefit from it. Obama should look to his own Democratic party and say it is too mixed and diverse to stand united for anything so it might as well be dissolved.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;President Obama Calls African-Americans a &lsquo;Mongrel People&rsquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so certain blacks are any more of a mongrel people than any other race, because interbreeding between ethnicities is rampant among all the peoples of the earth, but it involves only minor differences.  Basically the five races are still pretty much intact, each one easily identifiable upon examination from the other groups.</p>
<p>However, I think Obama would have been more accurate had he admitted that blacks are behind every other race on earth on the evoluntionary scale.  That&rsquo;s where the real difference is.  It is not just skin color.  It&rsquo;s their entire make up.</p>
<p>Lefties have pretty much controlled the basis of the debate wherein they have incorrectly established that we are all the same except for skin color.  That way they can condemn someone for giving truthful depictions of blacks being less than the average of all the races by pretending as if the differences only amount to criticizing pigmentation, covering up the fact that the difference in the races are significant on many levels.</p>
<p>If the differences in the races, especially blacks, would be recognized for what they really are, much chaos, trouble and turmoil would instantly cease, and an honest attempt could be made to make the situation better.</p>
<p>But the best of all situations is to be honest and admit that the races should be separated as nature intended, so that each group would be able to minimize their problems.</p>
<p>But that won&rsquo;t occur, and mankind will continue to make obviously bad choices, usually based on power, greed and lies.</p>
<p>And the end result will be as it has always been throughout the history of the world:  An eventual eruption into war in order to bring about the necessary change.</p>
<p>War is on the horizon and it is too late now to change course.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;re wrong, Mr. Prez, in your statement: &ldquo;there&rsquo;s still a reptilian side of our brain&rdquo; that leads people to not trust others &ldquo;if somebody sounds different or looks different.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Here is another example of your president&rsquo;s ignorance. The reptilian level trusts nobody, except the other sex during mating season. Only mammals and birds have the mental capability to trust others when it enhances their genetic survival to do so. Mammals and to some extent birds can form socially complex groups to achieve this end. They have the mental capacity to determine when an entity looks different and/or sounds different (and/or smells different).

		<p>In reference to some of the comments about &#8220;blacks&#8221; and &#8220;mulattoes&#8221; in this country: I have never heard of any modern American making that distinction.  About 85% of U.S. blacks have white blood, and many have Native American as well.  Blacks talk about &#8220;dark-skinned&#8221;, &#8220;brown-skinned&#8221;, and &#8220;light-skinned&#8221; individuals, instead of mulattoes, quadroons, octoroons, etc. like both whites and blacks once did.</p>

____________</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t?  That&rsquo;s probably because most &#8220;modern Americans&#8221; are not so meticulous or precise or racially aware are we here at Amren. </p>
<p>There is a definite distinction between real African &#8220;blacks&#8221; (they used to be called a perfectly correct word  beginning with &#8220;N-&#8221; and ending with &#8220;o&#8221;, but that scientific term seems to be out of favor today)&hellip; and their American mixed-race counterparts, many of whom are a good deal lighter and obviously not completely African.</p>
<p>For Obama (or anyone) to attempt to equate white Americans  who are of mixed NATIONALITIES with &#8220;mongrels&#8221; who are of mixed RACES is complete nonsense. There simply is no comparison.<br>
(Although they&rsquo;re trying hard to make it seem the same.)</p>

		<p>Mongrel is a derogratory term when applied to people. Mixed is not derogratory. It is a neutral term. He must not have had a good speech writer that day to check and re-check every word the puppet uttered.<br>

<p>There was no speech writer, this was Obama speaking off the cuff, something he is attrocious at, hence the teleprompters at virtually every public event where he speaks. Refering to someone of mixed race as a &#8220;mongrol&#8221; is pretty flagrantly and extremely racist, I remember him using the term &#8220;mutt&#8221; as well.</p>
<p>My take on it, is that it is similar to black&rsquo;s calling each other the &#8220;n word&#8221;.  Blacks and mixed race mullatos refer to themselves such racist terminology to show one another that they view themselves as still being oppressed by evil whitey.</p>

<p>It might &#8216;enrich&rsquo; our understanding of The Great One&rsquo;s statement, to consider &#8220;we&#8221; in the context of the &#8220;we&#8221; of the Narcissist.  Narcissists use &#8220;we&#8221; a lot, and the word is central to their view of the world centering around THEMSELVES.  Using &#8220;we&#8221; is a way in which they reach out and claim the world as their personal property.</p>

		<p>If you don&rsquo;t think seriously about the absolute and complete control of the news media in this country, ask yourself how much you&rsquo;ve heard about this; how long it lasted on national news outlets. Had these been a white man&rsquo;s comments it would just now, a week after the fact, be public fodder, exploding with comments from all the &#8216;civil rights activists&rsquo; and their cronies.</p>
<p>The number of these Freudian slips by this administration that have  been quashed by the powers that be are too numerous to mention, and give great insight as to how we are being manipulated.</p>

commentsObama&rsquo;s &#8220;mongrel people&#8221; are telling us our future: failed cities, afro crime, MSM silence.</p>
<p>Abolition, Underground Railroad, Emancipation, Freedman&rsquo;s Bureau, Loyal Leagues, 14th and 15th Amendments, Southern State Legislatures, Integration, Equality, Civil Rights, Affirmative Action, Diversity Race Privilege, and what do they do with it? </p>
<p> Destroy anything and everything they can get their hands on, which will eventually be everything, even the boats that could help them get home to Ghana where they would be happy and prosperous.</p>
<p>Where are the &#8220;esteemed, iconic, heroic, courageous, wonderful, renowned, trailblazing, pioneering&#8221; Civil Rights leaders? Shouldn&rsquo;t they be in there demanding that the afros stop &#8220;acting out&#8221; by killing each other?  </p>
<p>Oh, wait, they&rsquo;d rather mau mau an audience who will actually listen and obey: White Humanity who can easily be subdued into volunteer dispossession and degradation through accusations of &#8220;bias, racism, and White Privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>We must find a way to deflect the Civil Rights leaders and militants away from us and onto their own people.  The failures of black communities should equate to their failures of having any say over us what so ever.  We must learn their tricks. We must imitate voodoo. Our survival depends upon it.</p>

EAST ST. LOUIS • The Rev. Joseph Tracy said he&rsquo;s tired of going to funerals. And now, he suspects he&rsquo;ll be going to more of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s open field day now,&#8221; said Tracy, the pastor of Straightway Baptist Church here. &#8220;The criminals are going to run wild.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gang activity. Drug dealing. Cold-blooded killing. Tracy worries that a decision to shrink the police force by almost 30 percent will bring more of everything.<br>

<p>Yes, and that person would be reviled, uninamously, in the media by all &#8220;decent&#8221; and &#8220;right-thinking&#8221; people, and his career would now be in the trashcan. </p>
<p>And even though he would by now be groveling and apologizing desperately and insisting that he was taken out of context, there would be no forgiveness for his sin.  Hs career would be over. Permanently.</p>
<p>How many times have we seen this already?   &mdash;   And often for a much more innocent word or comment than calling anyone &#8220;mongrels&#8221;!</p>

		<p>President Obama is very correct about his and his ilks&rsquo; &#8220;reptilian side of his brain&#8221;-it&rsquo;s that feral&predatory; side that makes me harden my home with good locks and alarms and makes me go to Thunder Ranch and other &#8220;training centers&#8221; and to always have excellent situational awareness(saved me several times!!).Also just finished reading an old book called &#8220;Against our will:men,women and rape&#8221;in this otherwise leftist womens&rsquo; studies book a chapter on male-on-male rape inside prisons where black inmates taunt and terrorize smaller weaker white inmates with the truthful statement &#8220;You&rsquo;se taking the place of you&rsquo;se mothers and sister when we rape you&hellip;&#8221; Can there be any doubt about what&rsquo;s in &#8220;these peoples&rsquo;hearts&#8221; whether it&rsquo;s by seduction,deception or outright rape?I shudder.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is often not noted however is the _hybrid slump_ which inevitably happens within 1-2 generations because the gene markers for certain skills and abilities **diminish** when you defacto replace them with others and lacking similar recombinant DNA fail to improve or reinforce. Indeed, genetic -vulnerabilities- (to certain diseases etc.) in fact increase.&#8221;</p>
<p>Can you elaborate a little on the role of &#8220;similar recombinant DNA&#8221; in the passing on of &#8220;gene markers for certain skills&#8221;?  Is there a site for laymen on this?<br>
