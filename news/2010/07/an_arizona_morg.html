<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/us/29border.html?_r=1">An Arizona Morgue Grows Crowded</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James C. McKinley Jr., New York Times, July 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Pima County [Arizona] morgue is running out of space as the number of Latin American immigrants found dead in the deserts around Tucson has soared this year during a heat wave.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the law [SB 1070] has not kept the immigrants from trying to cross hundreds of miles of desert on foot in record-breaking heat. The bodies of 57 border crossers have been brought in during July so far, putting it on track to be the worst month for such deaths in the last five years.</p>
<p>Since the first of the year, more than 150 people suspected of being illegal immigrants have been found dead, well above the 107 discovered during the same period in each of the last two years. {snip}</p>

		<p>Mexico - A country so bad that people will willingly accept death to flee it.</p>
<p>But seriously, if Mexicans accept this price to escape from the purgatorial land of their birth, just what chance has border enforcement got?<br>
 Sorry Americans for sounding so negative, but one gets the feeling that point of no return (ie when a rigorous immigration enforcement policy actually had a chance), was passed long ago.</p>

		<p>Kinelm Digby-We&rsquo;re only talking about 150 people for the year out of a country of 100 million.  I hardly think that makes our cause a lost one.</p>

		<p>@1,</p>
<p>Visibility is the answer.</p>
<p>A man who dies alone in the desert is a statistic.  A man and his family who die at the border, in sight of their fellows, is an object lesson.</p>
<p>The military has the means, quite easily, to control this issue.</p>
<p>It can do it with &#8216;less than lethal&rsquo; force systems like ADS (millimeter waver heat projector) or focussed ultrasonics.  Or it can do it the old fashioned way with automated gun turrets, mines and remote artillery batteries firing VT fuzed rounds across a 50nm spread of territory from an overwatch position behind it (cued by REMBASS or similar unattended ground sensors).</p>
<p>The key element to remember here is that of Pavlov&rsquo;s Dog.  Build a negative stimulus into a behavior and the behavior will stop.  Not in months.  Not in weeks.  But in -days-.</p>
<p>Again, it would be simple.  It would be cheap.  And it would prevent people from trying something they already know that they shouldn&rsquo;t.  In a very short period of time.</p>
<p>We ourselves need to remember something as well: as much as the world and certainly Mexico will yell and scream, we are not holding people -in- as say Russia and the WARPAC states once did.  We are keeping them OUT.  Which is our right.</p>

		<p>The article is obviously a distorted and racist exaggeration by some white supremacist.  We all know that the United States benefits greatly by an enormous influx of Mexicans.  The more the better, in fact.  We know this because the New York Times tells us so.  It follows that Mexico must be a vastly more pleasant, prosperous, and advanced country than the United States, because it&rsquo;s almost 100% Mexican.  So surely no Mexican would risk death to leave that utopia.</p>

		<p>If anybody is looking for any interesting reading on this topic check out the latest print issue of the science mag &#8220;Discover&#8221;. They have an interesting piece about using DNA samples to identify the desiccated corpses strewn across the desert. One of the most fascinating things they found out from genetic markers was that 94 percent of the corpses found in the desert were in fact from non Spanish speaking, minority groups (basically Indians). </p>
<p>Basically, the &#8220;Coyotes&#8221; just dump their cargo in the middle of the desert them in the desert a hundred or so miles from the nearest down with no water and tell them to walk north. But of course whitey and his evil immigration laws are solely to blame. Spanish speaking migrants seem to be treated much better by the Coyotes and are not just left to die.</p>

		<p>This is very sad, but at the same time, I have to say at least, those who die in the sands of the desert, won&rsquo;t get to live illegally in the U.S.</p>
<p>Life in Mexico must be pretty terrible, if they are so willing to die under the blistering sun, like that.</p>

		<p>Why not leave the remains in the desert instead?  It seems to me that piles of bleached bones would serve as a useful deterrant to additional border-crossers.</p>
