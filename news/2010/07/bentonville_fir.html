<h1>Bentonville Firm Ordered to Forfeit Half-A-Million Dollars</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Evan Hoffmeyer, KATV-TV (Little Rock), July 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A news release from Deborah Groom, U.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, said U.S. District Judge Jimm Larry Hendren ordered the forfeiture of $503,562 after authorities determined the funds were proceeds of illegal activity.</p>
<p>According to the release Wednesday, the company [a Bentonville, Arkansas, firm, Sarasu IT Solutions Ltd] falsely claimed the foreign nationals as its own employees on forms provided to the federal Labor Department and federal Citizenship and Immigration Services so the workers could obtain visas to stay in the United States.</p>
<p>The federal prosecutor said that, in addition to the forfeiture ordered by Hendren, federal authorities administratively seized $437,776 from the company, bringing the total amount obtained from Sarasu to $941,338.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m curious as to who was Sarasu&rsquo;s major corporate client.</p>
<p>There seems to be more to this story, as in where were these people actually employed if not by Sarasu?  Is someone being protected?</p>

		<p>Here is how the scam works.</p>
<p>A group of rabid anti-white racists from india, rent out a basement in some place in the US where only farm folk live.  They put an ad in the paper advertising IT positions.  When nobody shows up, they apply for H1B visas at half the normal wage.  A corrupt democrat controlled congress asks no questions.  They promptly ship these people to major IT job areas in the US.  Anyone who applies for work has their resume thrown in the trash if they are white.  Only indians are hired, the balance of which are from these illegally obtained H1B visas.</p>
<p>An apathetic and overtaxed law enforcement shows little interest in throwing anyone in jail over this.</p>
<p>However, an interesting thing is happening.  People are beginning to notice that, in addition to committing various serious felonies, these people are also creating torts.  The opportunity is here to sue them into oblivion.  Any white person who was denied a job because of the color of their skin, can get in on a class action lawsuit.<br>

		<p>An organization of which I am a member, Secure Arkansas, just collected enough petition signatures for an Amendment to our Constitution to require citizenship papers to get welfare. It is sure to drive out most illegals.</p>

		<p>I can remember a very smart guy arguing with a lefty anti-capitalist. The smart guy said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You know you think to be anti-capitalist but you are exactly doing what the companies want. They want cheap stupid labour without any solidarity. And how do they reach it? They bring millions of stupid people from the third world to your country who are so criminal that your society falls apart. That is what the government and capitalists want. A stupid population which doesn&rsquo;t ask but only believe, which you can command but they have no solidarity to get together and fight back.&#8221;<br>
I think the anti-capitalist was a little bit shocked after that.</p>

		<p>Half a million down, but nobody goes to prison.  The real message here is that this is just part of doing business, and not really a &#8220;crime&#8221;.</p>
<p>Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>

		<p>Lest any one forget, the only IT employer in this location is Walmart. Their IT supply chain is the largest in the world.  They don&rsquo;t want to hire the labor themselves, any more than they would janitorial services, so they  outsource. Indian firms are hired to hire contractors. In turn, the Indian firms import large numbers of Indian nationals who are trained in one thing only, but that perfectly - the Walmart systems they have contracted to support. It is not possible for an American national to break into this self-contained system.</p>
