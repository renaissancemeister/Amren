			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Buske, Washington Post, July 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s lawsuit against Arizona&rsquo;s controversial immigration law won&rsquo;t stop Prince William Board of County Supervisors Chairman Corey A. Stewart&rsquo;s campaign to bring a similar law to Virginia.</p>
<p>If anything, said Stewart (R-At Large), he will push harder to get legislation passed at the state level that would enhance police officials&rsquo; power to capture, detain and deport illegal immigrants and create specific Virginia penalties for illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last month, Stewart launched the Virginia Rule of Law Campaign to rally support for Virginia immigration legislation. Stewart said Virginia needs to follow in Arizona&rsquo;s footsteps, even if it sends President Obama&rsquo;s administration after the commonwealth.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prince William has received national attention for its crackdown on illegal immigration. The county&rsquo;s law, enacted in 2007 and modified in 2008, requires that police officers check the immigration status of all people arrested on suspicion of violating a state or local law. Stewart said his campaign for a Virginia law is his own, not something he is doing as chairman of the board.</p>

<p>Thank you, Comrade Jennifer Buske, for letting us know in the very first sentence how we&rsquo;re supposed to react to this news.  Now I can feel proper horror, knowing that Arizona&rsquo;s law is &#8220;controversial.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your commissars at the <i>Washington Post</i> will be delighted at how well you follow instructions.<br>

		<p>Stewart is the kind of &#8220;acting stupidly&#8221; White politician we can support.  We support his &#8220;increasing the intensity&#8221; against our enemies.</p>
<p>May my White Lord God smile on his efforts, and may he remember  to put on his kevlar vest before he exits his house.</p>
<p>I pledge to act stupidly as often as possible by profiling all blacks with full Amren style Race Realism.</p>

<p>Write your politicians and DEMAND a law similar to Arizona&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>The witless Marxit ninny in the White House has declared war on the citizens of this country.  A considerable majority of Americans want stricter enforcement of immigration laws, do they?</p>
<p>Emperor Obama and William Holder, his hench-cretin, declare that not only will the federal government not enforce immigration regulations, they&rsquo;ll go after the states that do.</p>
<p>This is an incredible perversion of democracy and a head-on attack on our Constitution.  Our Civil War began over states rights issues rather less incendiary .</p>
<p>I believe this attack on the citizens of this nation will lead to a secession movement, and sooner rather than later. There are a good many states which contribute far more on a per capita basis to the GDP than others, and which find themselves being raped by the taxing authorities to support groups of people  whom they profoundly disapprove of.</p>
<p>And if the so-called commander-in-chief thinks he can use federal troops to put down local rebellions, he&rsquo;s in for an ugly surprise.  The combat arms troops of the four services are now practically all white, with blacks having reverted to their pre-Korean role of support troops.  Ordering them to fire on their fellow citizens will result in a military mutiny as well as secession movement.</p>

		<p>More of these type of laws should be passed to send a very strong message to Congress and sneaky Obama.  Perhaps, if enough citizens speak up, it will give courage to some of the members of Congress that deportation needs to be done to correct the demographic shift back to a white majority.  Otherwise, this country is lost.</p>

		<p>You know, the media in the world- not just the USA- is the most irresponsible, dishonest, lazy, sniveling lot of  &#8220;professionals&#8221; out there.</p>
<p>They always parrot the term &#8220;Illegal Alien CRACKDOWN&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>GIVE ME A FLIPPING BREAK. &#8220;CRACKDOWN&#8221; evokes images of a stick whipping down. Um, at LEAST, some forceful,  energetic, purposeful action. Instead, we have racist hustlers like Obama, Holder, and the doughy,  puffy, pasty Napolitano spouting lies that couldn&rsquo;t exceed the credibility of a bozo the clown monnologue.<br>
There is no crackdown&hellip;there is not even a &#8220;move against&#8221; illegal criminals. They are coddled and encoraged to stay.<br>
But then, the media are a pack of liars, and no one even cares.</p>

		<p>I am in favor of the law, but I think it should also penalize those who hire and rent to illegal immigrants. </p>

		<p>States should all make it a felony to be illegally present or to hire illegals and make the law-breaking subject to mandatory prison time.  Employers obviously are hiring aliens, especially for day work, without giving a hoot as to their status.  A strict law, with enforcement, should shut most of this down.  And most illegals will flee a state that promises serious arrest and prosecution.  If many states follow suit, Obama will be faced with filing multiple lawsuits.  Then, if the states refuse to comply with a judgment against them, what will he do?  Send federal troops all over the nation?  Already, 14 states have openly defied the federal government&rsquo;s laws against marijuana, and what&rsquo;s being done?</p>

		<p>Fallowing Arizona&rsquo;s Law means winning: <br>
Winning money by having less criminals in jails.<br>
Winning money by having more productive people.<br>
Winning money by havin less sensibility programs and translators for His<b>panic</b>s.<br>
And by winning money they can win elections and higher living quality. </p>
<p>We have seen how &#8220;diversity is great&#8221; -California had to please &#8220;racist hillbilly&#8221;-states for money. The only consequence for other states MUST be to stop diversity.</p>
