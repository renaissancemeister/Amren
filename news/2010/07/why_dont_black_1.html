<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2010/jul/09/black-people-camp-holidays">Why Don&rsquo;t Black People Camp?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Homa Khaleeli, Guardian (London), July 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;Do I look like a camper to you?&#8221; splutters my friend Kiren. And I have to admit, her blow-dried hair and impeccable nails don&rsquo;t scream &#8220;tent-lover&#8221;. What about Anna who grew up in Macclesfield, a stone&rsquo;s throw from the Peak District? &#8220;Why would I?&#8221; she demands, puzzled. Amal, meanwhile, has never even considered slumming it in a tent.</p>
<p>Camping may have thrown off its Peruvian socks image and become as fashionable as vintage clothes and cupcakes, but not everyone is enchanted. The few times I have been to a campsite, I&rsquo;ve always been one of the only non-white faces around. And while my white friends will camp anywhere  &mdash;  campsites, festivals, literary events  &mdash;  my non-white friends are not convinced.</p>
<p>Matthew Eastlake, marketing director of the Camping and Caravanning Club, agrees that ethnic minorities are &#8220;not hugely represented&#8221; in the club, despite a membership of nearly half a million. This tallies with evidence that few ethnic minority families go to the countryside for holidays  &mdash;  for instance, only 1% of visitors to our national parks are from a minority background, compared to 10% of the population.</p>
<p>Shalini, a lawyer who loves camping, admits she has been only with white friends. &#8220;You do stick out more on a campsite,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I brace myself for comments like &#8216;That&rsquo;s a funny name&rsquo; or &#8216;Where do you come from?&rsquo;. I think that would be uncomfortable for families or groups of young people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the fact that Asian family holidays tend to be sprawling, all-encompassing affairs. I remember the intakes of breath and faces squashed against the window as we tried to jam four adults and six kids in each car on family days out. While this might seem to fit with camping, Shalini reckons it makes ethnic minorities more careful about where they go. &#8220;Asian families tend to go on holiday with a whole load of people and a whole load of stuff; so they can be worried about putting people&rsquo;s noses out of joint.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Amal, who grew up in Somalia, it&rsquo;s the fear of the countryside. &#8220;I feel London is my comfort zone,&#8221; she tells me. Like many people, she is nervous about what Trevor Phillips once called the &#8220;passive apartheid&#8221; of the countryside  &mdash;  the fact that rural areas have such a low ethnic-minority population. &#8220;I worry that people will be mean or unfriendly with me,&#8221; Amal says. &#8220;Basically, I&rsquo;m worried they will be racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet camping is experiencing a boom, which Eastlake attributes in part to the recession. &#8220;Now it&rsquo;s not so cool to be extravagant and environmentally unfriendly. People are thinking more about family time and simple pleasures.&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing Asian families understand is family time  &mdash;  so what&rsquo;s holding us back? For a start, there is no culture of camping among immigrant communities, which means no nostalgic pull. The countryside is seen as a place to escape from. Satirical website Stuff White People Like puts its succinctly: &#8220;If you find yourself trapped in the middle of the woods without electricity, running water or a car, you would likely describe that situation as a &#8216;nightmare&rsquo; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. White people refer to it as &#8216;camping&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kiren tells me her parents, originally from Pakistan, would never have taken her camping. &#8220;Culturally, you are considered poor if you live or stay somewhere without brick walls.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mustafa Audhali, who helps run a Muslim Scout group in Birmingham, says the connection between simple living and poverty is just too strong. &#8220;The majority of ethnic-minority groups have come over during the last few decades into a deprived way of life, working in difficult jobs such as in factories or mills, and have slowly built themselves up  &mdash;  so camping may be seen as a backwards step.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I ask Anna&rsquo;s mum, who was brought up in Bangladesh, whether she would consider camping, she laughs. Yet I know her family comes from a beautiful village. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; sighs Anna. &#8220;So if they see a pretty river or green fields here, my family will say, &#8216;You think this is green? You should see Bangladesh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Things are changing, though. On my last camping trip I met a mixed-race couple, and Eastlake says numbers of ethnic minority campers are (slowly) increasing. Audhali says he has been inundated with requests from parents who want their children to enjoy sleeping outdoors in a way that they never did. &#8220;It&rsquo;s definitely something I will do with my kids. My daughter is only one at the moment, but I can&rsquo;t wait to take her. And when our scouts grow up, I hope they will take their own families.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even Amal is willing to be swayed. &#8220;I would consider it one day  &mdash;  but I would still prefer to have someone white camping with me.&#8221;<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m done with them.  Walked into a restaurant today in a White neighborhood and saw two of them sitting there staring menacingly at all the Whites, so made eye contact with them and walked out.  I boycott businesses that make blacks feel comfortable.<br>

		<p>Along these lines, blacks don&rsquo;t vacation as much, and they don&rsquo;t go far from home when they do.  Even when they&rsquo;re in their home cities, they are leery about being outside their own neighborhoods for too long, even if they&rsquo;re not gang bangers.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re ever some place like rural Mississippi, especially the Delta, and you&rsquo;re passing by old abandoned houses near cotton fields, the houses by themselves were almost always white-occupied, and the houses clumped up several very close-by were always black-occupied.</p>
<p>The other consideration is that you just very well can&rsquo;t plug in a Play Station and a TV inside a tent.</p>

		<p>When I worked in a large city, I met blacks who were seldom outside the urban area.  One woman told me she avoided even driving on interstates and was fearful of going into the countryside by herself.  If she traveled at all, she took a Greyhound bus, even though she had a comfortable vehicle that she could have driven.  She admitted that she was uneasy in a place where there were not a lot of fellow blacks.</p>

		<p>Having spent the better part of two years &#8220;camping out&#8221; in Vietnam, I have to side with blacks on this one.  Why anyone would want to sleep with the insects, without indoor plumbing, at the mercy of the wholly unmerciful elements is a mystery to me.  It&rsquo;s one thing if camping is an adjunct to an elk hunt in Idaho or Wyoming, but just to sleep like a caveman to no purpose?  Forget it.</p>
<p>I prefer hot showers, clean sheets, dishwashers, and modern stoves. </p>

<p>Too true.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve known about this, I always thought it odd. I moved to Florida after college and one of my co-workers was a black woman, in her 40&rsquo;s at the time, who had never traveled outside of Florida. In her whole life. Even then, she would only travel for something like a family reunion. I found this astounding, but it&rsquo;s been confirmed again and again over the 20 years since. </p>
<p>My current boss is firmly a member of the black bourgeoisie, and a man of rather refined and white-trending tastes (as an example, he&rsquo;s an avid golfer). Yet, in the 10 years I&rsquo;ve known him, he&rsquo;s never gone anywhere a real vacation, unless you count family visits and fishing trips. He takes time off, but will just do stuff around the house. </p>
<p>Again, very odd. If I had to venture a guess, it&rsquo;s that the places that capture the white imagination (the Grand Canyon, New York City, Hawaii, Washington, DC, Yosemite, just American examples) are of little or no interest to blacks, even with a veneer of culture.<br>

<p>Ok, we can stop right at the first sentence.</p>
<p>Even this woman knows she doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;look&#8221; like a camper. This isn&rsquo;t a problem, it&rsquo;s a choice.</p>
<p>Some of the comments on this article are interesting. Most agree with the premise that &#8216;racism&rsquo; is what keeps non-whites from camping. But this is the Guardian:</p>
<p>&#8220;We take a lot of showers and camp sites don&rsquo;t accomodate my particular need to wash twice a day </p>
<p>It gets cold. Oh, so very cold.&#8221; </p>

<p>You make a great point.  Even blacks that have the means to travel a long way from home don&rsquo;t want to.  Seems to me the only thing that gets them to travel over, e.g. 1000 miles, is a job offer, military service, migration due to economic destitution (e.g. The Great Migration out of the South and into big northern cities between the World Wars), and occasionally, visiting a relative in a faraway Federal prison.</p>
<p>Incidentally, that&rsquo;s part of the reason why the Federal government loves Project Exile type programs, to get black gang bangers into Federal prisons as far away from their &#8220;hood&#8221; as possible, as the more distance you put between them and their &#8220;homeys,&#8221; the less likely it is that they can continue their gang associations while in prison.</p>

		<p>Not directly related to camping, but still relevant:<br>
Here in Rome, where I live, there are always American tourists everywhere.<br>
They are always, always white.<br>
The only blacks you can see are obviously African immigrants. I don&rsquo;t think I ever saw a black tourist in this city.<br>
I used to wonder: do black Americans ever travel?<br>
It seems that they don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>HUH? They have more gangs in prison where they put out &#8220;hits&#8221; on people and you say that distance prevents these homeys from their gang life? Just the opposite.</p>

<p>Is that kind of thing still possible?  Yes.  But if they&rsquo;re in a state prison, they&rsquo;re within a partial day&rsquo;s driving distance from their neighborhoods.  What you find more and more when it comes to rural towns where state prisons are are that women relatives of a black man sent to prison for a relatively short stretch wind up moving to the towns so that there&rsquo;s someone from back home close by.  It&rsquo;s happening a lot in Missouri.</p>

I walked into a restaurant tonight and was preparing myself for the discomfort of encountering blacks. Walked in and started looking around to count them and confirm that they were under my allowed ratio before I sat down.  Good God Blessings Do Flow! Not a single black! Not even the wait staff had a black! A Race Miracle Straight from Heaven!</p>
<p>Dinner was delicious, relaxing, comfortable, friendly.  Then, of course, because the blacks just have a sense when White Humanity is enjoying its Whites Only Happiness, a black couple actually came inside, an neither smiled the entire time they were there.  He had on  rapper cap.  They looked completely out of place and would obviously have been more welcome elsewhere. But they wouldn&rsquo;t leave, so I guess they were helping us reach some beginner&rsquo;s level of the James Cone - Jeremiah Wright - Barry Obama &#8220;collective salvation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The most embarrassing moment for me was when I realized that all the White People, upon realizing what was happening, didn&rsquo;t drop their forks in mute shock and just stare at the blacks till they had to leave.  </p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t have worked, because sadly, more blacks started coming in a short while later.</p>
<p>It was great while it lasted, sort of like our White Republic.<br>

		<p>Concerning travel, I think it has more to do with disposable income than anything else.  I know plenty of black people who travel quite frequently when they can afford it.  The thing is, it&rsquo;s to go to Las Vegas, a concert, or an NBA game.  </p>
<p>Blacks aren&rsquo;t interested in Venice and the Eiffel Tower.  These are &#8220;white&#8221; things.  Blacks, well basically everyone out there but white people, want to be immersed and participate in their OWN culture.  I know, weird.</p>
<p>Camping is a different story, and far more simple.  It&rsquo;s a lot of work.  It&rsquo;s hard enough to get a lot of black guys to go out and work for a wage and be present in the home, why would you think you&rsquo;re going to get them to go out and cut wood, make a campsite, etc., just for the heck of it?</p>

		<p>Once again, one of the most absurd fads in contemporary advertising is using blacks in commercials for outdoor related activities. The two most idiotic I have seen in the past year or so: a) some Christmas commercial that showed a coal black couple frolicking in the snow outside a fancy isolated cabin in the mountains, wearing Nordic pattern cross country ski hats and sweaters and b) an investment firm that portrayed a black retiree flyfishing all by himself on a small remote mountain trout lake somewhere out West. I would cringe if I worked in that industry and the casting agent sent it blacks for those products and services.</p>

		<p>When blacks with money go on vacation, I think they often choose Caribbean cruises or air trips directly to majority-black paradise islands.</p>
<p>Their idea of a vacation is drinking and dancing with other blacks, and being waited on hand and foot.  </p>
<p>They do NOT want to pitch a tent and look at the sunset.  They do NOT want to have to gather wood for the fire, or have to figure out how the tent goes together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that part of the problem with camping is that it is a &#8220;high-trust&#8221; activity.  You are VERY vulnerable when you are sleeping in a tent.  Years ago, a family camping somewhere out West had their daughter kidnapped by a man who cut a hole in their tent while they were sleeping.  This was hugely upsetting to white people, who often camp, but probably meant nothing to blacks, who think camping is stupid.</p>

		<p>It is obvious that Black people have never been adventurous. Where are the great Black explorers? The Afrocentrist&rsquo;s claims that Africans sailed to Central America in antiquity and were the inspiration for the giant Olmec stone heads is, of course, nonsense. Africans have NEVER left Africa voluntarily in large numbers until just recently, and this was just to take advantage of generous European welfare and prosperity. Blacks will never remove themselves far from their comfort zones. All other races left Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago. The Africans that remained are the Black Africans of today. The people who never left home. These are not the kind of people you would expect to go &#8220;camping&#8221;. It takes an adventurous spirit to enjoy placing oneself in the middle of a wilderness. White people have this &#8220;adventurous spirit&#8221; in spades. In fact, they are the only ones who do. </p>

		<p>Camping and wilderness is a Northern European thing. British city dwellers dream of owning cottages and Russians dream of owning dachas. Northern Euros unlike other races (except maybe native Americans and the Japanese) dislike crowded living.</p>

		<p>It is quite possible to ascribe these attitudes of blacks towards the wilderness to generic deficiencies with regard to change, exploration, or general curiosity about the unknown.  And please do not give me this tripe about being raised in an urban area being the cause of such attitudes.  </p>
<p>I was raised in a totally urban area in the East Coast.  We were poor, and never went on vacation, or even traveled.  However, I dreamed, even longed, for travel throughout the world to both urban and wild areas.  This desire came from deep within me, not from external influences.  When I became an adult I fulfilled, and continue to fulfill these desires.   In my experience, One does not see such desires commonly in black people.</p>

		<p>I had a friend years ago who had been a camp counselor in a summer camp for underprivileged ghetto youths.  The kids were STUNNED when they arrived at camp and saw that there were no locks on the cabin doors or windows, and they were NOT happy with the situation.</p>
<p>Most black people probably cannot sleep in a tent due to fear.  If you grow up in a violent community, you never trust anybody.</p>

<p>I suspect this is one of those, &#8220;if you have to ask, you won&rsquo;t understand&#8221; types of things. Camping/hiking/backpacking and all that just isn&rsquo;t for everyone. For some of us though, getting out into nature, testing our skills and leaving all those creature comforts you mentioned behind is part of the draw. </p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, I have a friend who is also a Viet Nam vet, who loves camping&hellip;so I guess it just depends upon the person. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better this way really - if EVERYONE loved camping, the out-of-doors would get really crowded and unpleasant really fast!</p>

		<p>&#8220;The commercial featured a Black family&#8221;-Anonymous<br>
I noticed something too on TV. And I was able to get my willfully asleep girlfriend to grudgingly acknowledge it. It is how White families are portrayed. The last two or three commericals  I have seen will show Whites on vacation or a road trip. And there is never more than one kid ALONE in the back seat. No brothers or sisters!! No wrestling with each other, or three faces sticking out the car window watching the scenery roll by. Always shows two parents up front, with a lone child either staring wistfully at the countryside or engrossed in their own Sony walkman world. Surreal and discomforting!</p>

		<p>Blacks aren&rsquo;t into environmentalism (or most other limousine liberal issues).  This is another of the cleaves between white and minority liberalism.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t post much here because I&rsquo;m a liberal on most non-Diversity issues; but I&rsquo;m very concerned that kind of liberalism I do want would not be possible in NAM-heavy country.  Like how a good idea like helping single mothers turned into creating whole cities of them, because minorities couldn&rsquo;t implement the idea correctly.</p>

		<p>Oh PLEASE let it continue so!  There have to be SOME places whites can go, and things we can do, that are safe from black disruption and violence!  Praise GOD blacks don&rsquo;t like to golf, go camping, visit European cultural sites, museums (unless witless liberal school teachers organize an inner city field trip).  Black kids would rather spray paint graffiti on the Mona Lisa than marvel at it&rsquo;s beauty and value.   I was camping with my kids many times.  The ONLY time it was ever unpleasant, it was a nightmare.  We&rsquo;d decided to rent a campsite to cut costs near our NJ beach destination.  Never again.<br>
The only campsite left was next to a rusted out camper.  Looked like it had been there 20 years and never maintained.  Every time the occupant flushed the toilet the stench was unbearable - obviously it had never been pumped out.  The occupant would sit out on the &#8220;patio&#8221; area and play cards all night.  The loud, whining, yakking went on all night.  Yup.  Owned by the ONLY black in the whole campsite.<br>
Every night she had black friends staying with her.  It was like living in the ghetto.  Loud music, loud yakking, rudely so.  We stayed one night only on finding out there was NO place to move to, and found a motel for an exorbitant cost, our having not reserved it in advance.  Worth it to be free of the black influence in what was normally, in our experience, a friendly, respectful and pleasant WHITE venue.  PLEASE GOD KEEP THE BLACKS IN THEIR ATTITUDE AS TO LEAVING SOME VENUES TO ONLY WHITES.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest. Why would any group that gets things handed to them, for their entire lives, want to work at loading, and unloading, camping equipment, and setting up tents? That will be the day. For those that do it in the Army, there is quite a bit of moaning and groaning, that goes along with doing it.</p>
<p><br>
As for the safety concerns while camping, I would always bring our dogs along for the trip, so we always have our protection on four legs, with us. Of course, you never know what you might encounter, so a good rifle, or shotgun, is always at hand, too.<br>

		<p>I live in British Columbia and I have noticed that almost all the tourists who venture outside the cities are white.  Except for the Japanese, who like to take bus trips to places such as Banff.  But they mostly just take pictures and are not into hiking, and not at all into adventure activities such as rafting or climbing.  These seem to be exclusively white activities. </p>
<p>There is an &#8220;Adventure Guide&#8221; program at a college in BC, and the students in this program are all white.  There are students in this program from Europe  and Australia and the USA  &mdash;  all white.  </p>
<p>Other programs of study that seem to be  white are things such as Forestry and Natural Resource Science.  It seems to be mainly whites who are worried about the environment.  Groups that are interested in saving the whales, such as Greenpeace, are all white.  </p>
<p>The recently release movie about dolphin slaughter in Japan (The Cove) was made by white people.  The Japanese seem to be very angry about the film, and about being criticized.  The Japanese are the only people who still hunt endangered whale species. I don&rsquo;t know if there is any opposition to this within Japan, but I doubt if there is much.   It is not really a free society. Mind you, the number one environmental guru in Canada, David Suzuki, is of Japanese decent.  But he is a second or third generation Canadian.   </p>
<p>Another thing I&rsquo;ve noticed is that is mostly white people (or well assimilated immigrants) who keep pets, and care for them well.   In most other cultures animals tend to be treated rather badly.    I don&rsquo;t know why that is, but it is something I have noticed.</p>

		<p>First of all, I prefer campers to be quiet and respectful, so the fear of camping on the part of &#8220;louder cultures&#8221; is not a problem for me.</p>
<p>Second, I think one of the temperamental differences (genetic in origin) between whites and blacks is related to the sense of beauty.  Whites appreciate the beauty of nature in a transcendent way.  We are able to value nature for its own sake, beyond our personal interests.  </p>
<p>I have never met a black person or read a black writer who expressed an environmentalist perspective on the world.  Blacks seem limited to a strictly anthropocentric world-view (a cognitive limitation), and so Nature is irrelevant or utilitarian.  Black poachers would already have finished off most of the great creatures of Africa without white intervention.  &#8220;Beauty&#8221; for blacks seems limited to the realm of sexuality.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;What you find more and more when it comes to rural towns where state prisons are are that women relatives of a black man sent to prison for a relatively short stretch wind up moving to the towns&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In California, prisons such as Pelican Bay, located in a remote section of Northern California, a cold, gloomy and rainy section of California, were built in those locations specifically to prevent an influx of welfare families from &#8216;following their men&rsquo; and forming large crime-ridden communities around the prisons as has happened in other cities in California where prisons are located.</p>
<p>And yes, Pelican Bay is for the &#8216;worst of the worst.&rsquo;  DH and I watched a very interesting program as to how those in solitary cells, locked-down 23 or more hours per day with no contact permitted between prisoners such as in Pelican Bay,  could still the shots to their minions on the outside  &mdash;  ordering hits, directing the gang&rsquo;s drug activities, etc.</p>
<p>Prisoners are allowed to write so many letters per week as per &#8216;prisoners rights&rsquo; and use coded language, word substitutions, rune-type alphabets (all easily cracked by postal monitors) to keep control on the outside.  One prison official showed incredibly beautiful, intricate pencil drawings and other artwork sent out by prisoners that contained carefully hidden, cryptic messages and orders invisible and overlooked by the prison censors reading the mail who passed them along as nothing more than artwork done to alleviate the chronic boredom of prison life.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, law enforcement knows messages are still being passed, not only to gangs on the outside but between distant prisons as well. </p>

		<p>Years ago I read the memoirs of some WWII soldier or another, and he remarked that one of the things that the G.I.s frequently commented while fighting on the front lines in Europe was on how much the German men ENJOYED the life of a soldier.  Many Americans also enjoyed being a soldier, but many hated it.  But among the Germans, the love of soldiering was nearly universal.</p>

		<p>Why not say it like it is&hellip;.99% of non-whites do not have the ability to survive without being given, food, shelter, clothing and everything else as direct handouts from white civilization.</p>
<p><br>
If white civilization were to falter.  99% of non-whites would die within weeks, if not days (from something as simple as not being able to identify and secure a source of water).</p>
<p>Much the same thing would happen were whites to simply turn their backs on non-whites.  There would be no &#8220;camp of the saints&#8221; scenario.  Nor would there be much in the way of taking from whites.  The last of the guns and other weapons would kill alot of (non-white) people, but they simply do not possess the ability to move from one place to another and commit organized aggression.</p>
<p>Detroit would burn but Idaho would continue much as it has for hundreds of years.</p>

		<p>  In the rural South blacks seem to get out in the woods much more than up North. Southern blacks particularly love to fish and you see them even at remote rivers or lakes. Some are avid hunters as well. I think blacks generally feel more comfortable in the South having lived there for many generations. Many urban blacks, in both the North and South, seem uncomfortable in the wilderness and are genuinely afraid of wildlife, particularly snakes.</p>

		<p>Probability that a black person will go camping at a campground with roads, fire pits, water, etc. in a given year: 1 in 7.6<br>
Probability that a white person will do the same:  1 in 3.3<br>
(Source:  bookofodds.com)</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re about twice as likely to camp at least once per year, but black people still go camping fairly often.  Honestly I think it&rsquo;s going a bit overboard to suggest that blacks don&rsquo;t want to watch a sunset or are too lazy or incompetent to pitch a tent.  Little children can pitch a tent.</p>

		<p>Lots of great comments. Yes, blacks in the South love to fish, perhaps especially men from my generation (60+). But blacks in the South are close to their rural roots, and see something of value in a river or a lake or a patch of woods. Young urban blacks would not come out here, and probably most blacks in the UK are urban, with roots in a rural world in the Caribbean, so that the Northern European countryside seems inhospitable and alien. <br>

		<p>A quick reality check regarding black campers can be had with a trip to your local REI store.  The chance that you will encounter any blacks there is vanishingly small.  I like camping and fishing quite a lot, and lucked out marrying a gal who also does.  We don&rsquo;t get any done lately because of the hassle involved in taking a three year-old; another of the unanticipated consequences of parenthood.</p>
