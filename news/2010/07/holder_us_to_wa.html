<h1>Holder: US to Watch Arizona for Racial Profiling</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Google News, July 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Justice Department hasn&rsquo;t ruled out filing a second lawsuit challenging Arizona&rsquo;s immigration law if evidence shows racial profiling at work, Attorney General Eric Holder says.</p>
<p>The Obama administration sued Arizona last week, arguing that the state is impinging on federal responsibilities for dealing with immigration. {snip}</p>
<p>The suit didn&rsquo;t deal with concerns about racial profiling so that it could focus on the most serious problem with the law, Holder said in an interview broadcast Sunday on CBS&rsquo; &#8220;Face the Nation.&#8221; In six months or a year, his department might look into the law&rsquo;s impact on racial profiling, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who defends the state immigration law as constitutional, said she believes federal officials would have included racial profiling in the suit if they thought it was an issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brewer said she is confident that the state law can be enforced without racial profiling, which she acknowledged is against state and federal law.</p>

		<p>And yet they do&hellip;..nothing.</p>
<p>This is a game of &#8220;chicken&#8221; Obama cannot win.  Either he will let the issue go, and be revealed even more of a weak, idiot with nothing backing him up.  Or he will get some kangaroo court to find the way he wants (no atter what the law says) and arizona will IGNORE it&hellip;..breaking the power of the federal government and courts over the states with one risk free precedent setting stand.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, the first option is much safer for Obama.</p>

		<p>The Federal law does not include protection against &#8220;racial profiling&#8221;.</p>
<p>The US Border Patrol has no problem with checking the identification of anyone in the border zone&hellip;..and a few miles from the border they have armed checkpoints, where they ask EVERYONE, to show proper ID. Is this racial profiling? or is it only racial profiling when state and local officials do the same damned thing?<br/>

		<p>&ldquo;The Obama administration sued Arizona last week, arguing that the state is impinging on federal responsibilities for dealing with immigration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, now I honestly know that 2+2=5!</p>
<p>How can a state be &ldquo;impinging on federal responsibilities,&rdquo; when the federal &ldquo;government&rdquo; ignores those responsibilities at best, and at worst encourages the reverse when it comes to questions regarding the &ldquo;undocumented?&rdquo; Or put another way, can a state still enforce speed limits and the drinking age, without fear of &ldquo;profiling&rdquo; by race or other reality based criteria?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Glenn Beck&rsquo;s show today at 5 P.M. was almost strictly about race. It was an excellent show. But he did touch on the above subject of the feds suing Arizona also.  </p>
<p>Tune in Tuesday.  That show will delve a little more deeply into the subject of race.  I thought Beck had been pressured to stop his controversial shows in favor of giving history lessons, but apparently not, because he&rsquo;s back at it saying things about black racism, etc. that will never be heard anywhere else on t.v. OR radio, although Rush is getting into it a bit.</p>
<p>Regarding the Arizona law, there are several states that will be introducing bills identical to Arizona&rsquo;s, so the racists Holder and Obama might get more than they can handle in a few months.</p>
<p>Both of them, however, don&rsquo;t seem to care that they&rsquo;re causing the white population to sit up and take notice of black racism like never before.  </p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t care what their reasons for doing so might be, if indeed they have anything logically planned, because they&rsquo;re doing almost exactly what I&rsquo;ve been hoping for.</p>

		<p>The obsession about &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; has made all sorts of law enforcement impracticable if not impossible.  That was the intent.</p>

If any of this goes forward, let Arizona call President Obama as a witness to testify to exactly what he has done to enforce federal immigration laws.</p>
<p>He claims he&rsquo;s doing a better job than other administrations. Let him explain how under oath.</p>
<p>If the left pushes this, it could backfire.</p>

		<p>What is the intent of this? The intent of this is to import  nonwhite Democratic voting block into America that will vote to make the Native Born White Majority a racial majority within the borders of America as soon as possible. </p>
<p>In other words, Attorney General Eric Holder and Kenyan foreigner  who was voted president of the United States by a rapidly growing post 1965 nonwhite population are waging a vicious race war against the Native Born White Majority. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t live in the United states, but if I did, I would really feel that our own federal government was working against us!</p>
<p>This is almost unbelievable, I think!</p>
<p>But then, Eric Holder is an Obama appointee&hellip; and possibly a man who has benefitted form affirmative action all his life (like Barack himself).</p>

		<p>Number 8 is exactly right.  This will be a blessing in disguise for whites.  We all will now know what the agenda of blacks are once they gain power.  It&rsquo;s not equality, it&rsquo;s not industry, or trying to &#8220;bring us together.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s about displacing whites, killing us, taking our possessions, and our women.  I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re waking up and we should take action to preserve our race and country from non-white hordes.</p>
