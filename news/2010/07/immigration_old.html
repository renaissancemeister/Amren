<h1>Immigration, Old Age and Technology to Rule Wente&rsquo;s Canada 47 Years From Now</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Margaret Wente, Globe and Mail (Toronto), July 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Forty-seven years ago, when my family arrived in Canada, I could never have imagined what kind of country we&rsquo;d grow up to become. Toronto was a boring backwater. Almost everyone was beige. Nobody drank wine or ate foreign food. Everything was shut on Sunday, because you were supposed to be in church. The Royal York was the tallest building in the city. Dief was the chief, the flag looked British, and nobody had heard of Leonard Cohen or Joni Mitchell yet.</p>
<p>What will Canada be like 47 years from now? Let me imagine.</p>
<p>No one was surprised when Shibani Pushparajah became prime minister. The brilliant second-generation immigrant, who was born in Mississauga, belongs to Canada&rsquo;s second-largest ethnic group. But really, she&rsquo;s a citizen of the world. The last white male prime minister lost his seat in 2043. The only white man in Ms. Pushparajah&rsquo;s diverse cabinet is the minister of agriculture.</p>
<p>Since the turn of the millennium, all of our population growth has come through immigration, mostly from China, India and the Philippines. In the thriving megalopolis of Greater Toronto (population: 12 million), people of European descent make up less than a third of the population. The biggest culture gap isn&rsquo;t between competing ethnic and linguistic groups, though. It&rsquo;s between the vibrant, globally minded, multiracial cities and the shrinking white ghettos of the Atlantic provinces and the rural hinterland.</p>
<p>Canada&rsquo;s population has swelled to 44 million. But immigration hasn&rsquo;t reversed the aging trend. Although the national IQ is high, so is the national age. A third of all Canadians are over 65. But &#8220;retirement,&#8221; as they used to call it, is long gone. There weren&rsquo;t enough workers to support the retirees. Today, you can&rsquo;t get old-age benefits until you&rsquo;re 75 or 80. That&rsquo;s really not that old. Breakthroughs in biomedicine have yielded cures for many of the old degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s, and the average natural life expectancy is pushing 100.</p>
<p>Even so, health-care costs are ruinous, and taxes are sky-high. Like other cash-strapped Western nations, Canada wants to cut people off medicare when they turn 90. Instead, it will offer you a lavish farewell party at a time of your choosing, along with a generous endowment for your descendants and a delicious cocktail to put you to sleep forever.</p>
<p>Some of the old folks remember when the neighourhoods were full of kids. They&rsquo;re much more quiet now. For every person under 16, there are two people over 65. Instead of schools, governments are building group homes for geezers. One thing hasn&rsquo;t changed, though. Caregivers from the Philippines are as popular as ever. Only now, their dependent, diapered charges are at the other end of life.</p>
<p>Compared to Europe, Canada is lucky. Italy is so depopulated that the entire nation has been declared a vast theme park. Most Canadians can&rsquo;t afford to go there any more. Admission is restricted to the very wealthy  &mdash;  mostly Asians  &mdash;  who are happy to fork over the $10,000-a-day entrance fee. (All sums in post-Euro, pre-crash USD.) Instead, we flood to bargain-basement Central America, where huge colonies of elderly North Americans prop up the economies of entire nations.</p>
<p>Today, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine how powerful Quebec&rsquo;s French-Canadians used to be in national life. Demographics and immigration did them in. The separatist party collapsed in 2025, after its supporters literally died out. French-speaking immigrants from Africa and Haiti didn&rsquo;t care about the old battles, and with the end of transfer payments, Quebec lost its leverage on Ottawa for good. Today Quebeckers make up less than 20 per cent of the Canadian population, and live in the poorest province of them all. But they still have the best places to eat.</p>
<p>After the Great Crash of 2024, when China finally stopped buying U.S. debt, Canada endured its darkest decade since the Depression. We&rsquo;re still scarred by the memory of 18 per cent unemployment and the great pension fund collapse. Fortunately, our once-reviled oil sands saved our bacon. We leased them to China for 199 years at highly attractive rates, and that, along with a bonanza of new discoveries in the North, has made us nearly as rich as the Norwegians. We are happy the world is finally weaning itself off oil, but please, not yet.</p>
<p>Nostalgia buffs think everything was better in the good old days, of course. They love to sit around and listen to old Joni Mitchell tunes and show off their souvenir copy of the last Globe and Mail printed on dead trees. Their grandkids can&rsquo;t imagine a time when The Globe did not exist entirely in cyberspace. Everyone agrees the world has changed a lot in 47 years. But one thing hasn&rsquo;t changed at all. Canada is still the best country in the world.<br>

		<p>I happen to admire the work done by American Renaissance in promoting intellectual debate, on the future of Western Civilization. I fully defend their right to free speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of association, and I was one of those who protested against the shutting down of the recent Amren Conference. But there is one issue that I would like White Nationalists to think about. If they were non-white people, would they consider the long term survival of white people to be a good thing or a bad thing?</p>
<p>I will try to be fair to whites. Despite what IQ tests tell us, I am one of those who believes whites are more intelligent than East Asians. When you compare white contributions to science and technology to those of Asians, there is nothing that East Asians have invented, that comes close to white scientific and technological achievements. But great intelligence is not the same as wisdom. Whites are also more beautiful than other races. But beautiful people are not necessarily better people. </p>
<p>The late Susan Sontag once declared that &#8220;the white race is the cancer of human history&#8221;. White people are responsible for the extinction of some of the most beautiful animal species that have ever walked on this earth. They began by destroying the vast herds of wildlife that were plentiful in their native homeland of Europe. After that, they moved on to other lands outside of Europe, and caused the extinction of other species in those lands. The extinct species are too numerous to list. The best known ones include the dodo, the European lion, the Eurasian Aurochs, and the Tasmanian Wolf.</p>
<p>White Nationalists often make the case for the survival of the white race in biological terms. That whites are biologically superior in their civilization-creating abilities, and that only white people were able to develop modern science and technology. That may well be true. But would more white people be a good thing for the world? Can the environment of this ecologically fragile earth support more whites? There are 6.8 billion people in the world, today. There are about 1.1 billion whites and 5.7 billion non-whites. America, with 300 million people, consumes 25 percent of the world&rsquo;s oil, and causes more carbon-dioxide emissions than any other nation. But America has only 4.4 percent of the world&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>Suppose the 5.7 billion non-whites in the world, were magically transformed into white people, and all the 6.8 billion people in the world enjoyed the same standard of living as white Americans. Would that be a good thing for the global environment? How many more of the remaining wild animal species and natural forests would survive?</p>
<p>If fewer whites in the world lead to the decline and collapse of modern civilization, that would not be a terrible thing, in ecological terms. Australian Aborigines are, by European Standards, believed to be the least intelligent people on earth, with IQs of 62. But their lack of intelligence should not be equated with a lack of wisdom. Aborigines in Australia lived in harmony with nature for 50,000 years, alongside Australia&rsquo;s unique wildlife species. Modern European industrial civilization has existed for only 300 years, and has been an ecological disaster, so far, in every country that has adopted it. Can anyone imagine European industrial civilization surviving 5,000 years from today? Does anyone imagine the shape that the earth will be in, in that time? If the global white population is declining, it is because nature put a self-destruct mechanism in European genes, as a means of restoring the ecological balance of the earth.</p>

		<p>Canada is a resource economy so it can still retain some modest amount of wealth. The problem is that the future/present multiracial, multiethnic Canada will be corrupt as hell and resources can be stolen easily. That wealth is going to end up in the hands of organized crime/ogliarchs. The lifespan of future Canadians Isn&rsquo;t going to increase, its going to drop because elderly whites will die off in droves when the pyramid scheme that makes up the pension system collapses. Besides, non white ethnic groups with few elderly and many children are going to vote against any money being spent on old white &#8220;losers.&#8221; How long do blacks live anyway? If blacks manage to live past 60 they are doing well. </p>
<p>Europe isn&rsquo;t going to be a theme park, its going to be a giant civil war area. Some euro states in eastern and central Europe might even have managed to turn into  Volklands (which counts as a &#8220;win&#8221; in this game of survival) while others like France have become semi theocracies where the native population is a politically irrelevant minority. The Mediterranean states will be filled with people from the third world, primarily Africa and the Middle East, the combination of poor birth rates and easy access is not conductive to long term survival. </p>
<p>Britain will be an island thats massively overpopulated and thus depending on massive imports of foodstuffs and energy. But the Brit gas and oil fields are in permanent decline and the Brits aren&rsquo;t manufacturing.  Canadian refugees will certainly not be welcome anywhere in Europe, regardless of color. </p>

		<p>When people say diversity it means no white people.  Black people are the battering rams for diversity.  They keep the drumbeat of quilting and shaming white people going.  A historian (I can&rsquo;t remember his name) wrote 80 years ago that the worst thing that could happen to white people is the lowering of our morale.  Black people along with all other non-white people know that if you continue to quilt and shame white people eventually we will give in and work in the interests of non-white people.  Non-white people want you to be ashamed you belong to the race that conquered the world and made modern society.  Non-white people want you to be ashamed you belong to the race with white skin, different hair colors, different eye colors, and beautiful facial features.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; in 47 years. But one thing hasn&rsquo;t changed at all. Canada is still the best country in the world.&#8221;  The intelligent, guilt-free white residents who made Canada wouldn&rsquo;t think that obviously because they already left or decided not to bring children into the world.  The general migration pattern has been for non-white people to move to white-populated areas and for white people to move to white-populated areas.  White people create a social, cultural, architectural, and creative dynamic that is highly desirable.  Non-white people can not replicate it even East Asians who copy everything.</p>

		<p>To poster #1.</p>
<p>You make some observations that seem pertinent on face value, but if you take a look at Mayan civilization, it, too, collapsed from some man made problems such as over population and warfare.  </p>
<p>Chinese civilization for thousands of years has been remarkably rapacious.  They did not become as ravenous for resources as they are now because of contact with whites.  Their history is full of warfare, environmental change and exploitation of resources.  Every Chinese person I know, and I know a lot and some are my friends, are ultilitarian and will use up everything and then throw it away for more.</p>
<p>Places such as India or the Middle East have no special &#8216;bond&rsquo; with nature that has guided their societies for centuries.  They have warred and changed the environment as much as anywhere else.</p>
<p>The idyllic image of happy Africans farming peas and millet and dancing in masks belies a very violent history of competition for resources.</p>
<p>The equally ideal image of native Americans walking through forests spouting earth wisdom and worshipping nature is also only partially true.  They were better managers of their lands, to be sure, but their populations were more scattered.  Given a few more centuries of growth without European invasion and they might have developed a very different way of life.  (The Indians of the Northeast were already started to get overcrowded and used to make a lot of war, leading to the 5 nations political deal that was a harbinger of more development to come.)</p>
<p>The Babylonians, Persians, Chinese, Aztecs, Romans, Arabs, etc - all of them had their moments of expansion and they used technology to conquer and lord it over others, wasting a lot of resources along the way. That whites have been successful on a larger scale is no reason to indict whites in particular.</p>
<p>If the Chinese had developed artillery first (and weren&rsquo;t hemmed in by deserts and mountains) then we might all be speaking chinese.  If the Mongols were more long sighted, and had developed better political structures, well, you get the idea.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, white-based civilization uses too many resources, but this does not mean that the rest of the world is made up of noble tree-huggers who will voluntarily refrain from adopting modern lifestyles also.</p>
<p>In fact, said non-whites have flooded into white civilizations because THEY WANT what we&rsquo;ve created, signifying that 1) all people want something better and 2) they&rsquo;re willing to go to great lengths to obtain it.</p>
<p>Now here is the answer to the problem you&rsquo;ve proposed: why preserve white people?  Given the complex nature of the world today, and given how the entire world is seeking to replicate the best of modern life - who will be able to think up the solutions to the ecological, political, technological and social problems of the future?</p>
<p>(For example: BP is trying so many ways to stop the oil leak, and they&rsquo;ve been proposing and testing all kinds of ideas.  If it were a Chinese oil company or an African one, could we be confident they would be capable to even envision a proper solution beyond nuking the site?)</p>
<p>With all due respect, I have not met very many Asians who are capable of the kind of creativity that white people are capable of (a feat largely due to surviving the ice age through creative thinking which left us with this gift in great quantities). </p>
<p> Most Indians I&rsquo;ve met are very nice and very hard workers, but ditto the creativity problem.  Africans and latinos? You can address that better than I.</p>
<p>So in short, the over populated and rapidly changing world needs some enclave of functioning white civilization so it can produce the kinds of thinkers needed to save us all.  </p>

		<p>Back Mr. Patel, with your racists attacks!  India is no ecological paradise.  Whites learn from our environmental mistakes.  Indians are just smart enough to survive while destroying their environment.  Look at the Ganges.  Disgusting.  And then, like a plague, your people infect the rest of the world.  America has 200 million Americans and 100 non-whites.  If all you invaders left the country that MY forbears built we could maintain our standard of living and continue to lesson our ecological impact while doing so.</p>
<p>My beautiful New Jersey is quickly becoming a paved over h*ll because of brown immigrants.  My commute has increased from a ½ hour to an hour because of the increase in population, all due to migrants.  Most of the faces in the cars around me are now brown.  Most of the new houses are populated by browns.  Our cities have been made uninhabitable by blacks and browns.  No one asked my grandparents, or parents or my generation if you people could take over.</p>
<p>No Mr. Patel, your people are not my equals.  Your people come here to leach off the society WE built that you can not.  Whites make mistakes but we learn from them.  We don&rsquo;t continue taking the same well worn but pointless path.  The one lesson we haven&rsquo;t learned is that charity and equalitarianism should not be shared outside the race. <br>

<p>You know #1 is an example of an Indian (judging from the name) one Indian among millions who have come to OUR country to take part in the theft of our United States along with all the other non-Whites.</p>
<p>I think I need to remind dear &#8216;Deepak&rsquo; that in his country - India - there are now over 1 BILLION PERSONS.  Dear Deepak likes to comment that Whites:</p>
<p>began by destroying the vast herds of wildlife that were plentiful in their native homeland of Europe. After that, they moved on to other lands outside of Europe, and caused the extinction of other species in those lands. The extinct species are too numerous to list. The best known ones include the dodo, the European lion, the Eurasian Aurochs, and the Tasmanian Wolf.</p>
<p>- Well let me state that nothing contributes more to the destruction of this Earth than the over-population of countries like his.  His countrymen are destroying the land and taxing the earth along with Pakistan and China - like no other countries, but according to him -</p>
<p>Can the environment of this ecologically fragile earth support more whites?</p>
<p>The question should be -</p>
<p>Can the environment of this ecologically fragile earth support more NON-WHITES?</p>
<p>It is the Whites who are ecologically conscious and ONLY the Whites, no Indians, or Orientals.  As a matter of fact the pollution in countries like India and China is reaching astronomical proportions.  </p>
<p>What is destroying US is our foolish weakness for multiculturalism and so-called &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and our White guilt complex.  This is what is allowing folks like Deepak to enter our borders and dictate how evil we are. <br>
 <br>
We are the people who crossed the ocean and tamed a continent.  <br>
We are the people who went to the moon.<br>
We are the people who established the highest standard of living in the world.<br>
We are the people who invented and developed the computer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we are also the people who are letting in the dregs of the 3rd World to dictate to us on how evil we are and who - if this insanity isn&rsquo;t stopped, and we don&rsquo;t rise above this guilt complex - will eventually destroy us and the rest of the earth as well.</p>

		<p>White liberals disgust me more than all the hordes of loathsome Third Worlders infesting our lands.  They love nothing more than disparaging their own race and gloating about us becoming minorities in our own land, or even better, simply dying off.  Perhaps that is indeed to be our fate, going out with a whimper.  If not, then I hope these traitors are remembered well.  </p>

<p>I think the thing to focus on when it comes to prosperous people in prosperous societies having such a big carbon footprint isn&rsquo;t the entire society&rsquo;s carbon footprint, but racial differences therein.  Black Americans, relative to their prosperity relative to white Americans, tend to waste energy.  I could give you many anecdotes, but it would make for an exceedingly long post.</p>
<p>So the question is this:  Is the environment threatened if the 5.7 billion non-whites in the world become 5.7 million altruistic high IQ whites, or they become indolent insouciant non-whites within white countries?  Black Africans might have low carbon footprints, but they are blindingly destitute, by and large.  Translate them to the white world, give them some time, and their carbon footprint would go way up to match their native born black American brethren.</p>

		<p>For an amusing read, get a copy of a &#8220;future book&#8221; written in the 1950&rsquo;s or early 1960&rsquo;s. These books described what life would be like in the U.S. in the next century. I have read several such, and they agree in being wrong in most of their predictions. Here is my recollection of a few of the worst.</p>
<p>One predicted unmanned rockets landing on the moon, others predicted human colonies on the moon and mars. </p>
<p>One expert predicted the U.S. population would stabalize at ~250M because the Pope had agreed to allow Catholics to use contraception.</p>
<p>3-D television was predicted, but there was no mention of high speed cable.</p>
<p>None of the experts thought that immigration would be a significant factor in U.S. demographics.</p>
<p>Computer prices would drop somewhat and speeds would increase by an order of magnitude. No expert thought computers would become household appliances.</p>
<p>Video telephones would be available, but used only by the wealthy and by businesses.</p>
<p>The cold war would be continuing, but I think that one expert thought it would be winding down.</p>
<p>Black-white conflicts would be over. Race would not be a factor in the new millenium. As I remember, the experts were in complete agreement on this one.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Therefore, I don&rsquo;t waste my time on the noise that Ms. Wents emits.</p>

		<p>What does the discussion about the perceived lack of Asian ingenuity have to do with anything? Whether that is even true or not is irrelevant; this is about survivability. The Chinese may not have created anything in recent times that would be deemed revolutionary, but if there&rsquo;s something they do know, it&rsquo;s how to survive (and often in the face of adverse conditions). Their civilization has withstood the test of time in its 5000+ years, and that in and of itself says something important.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what they understand: Life is not about making technological advancements. It&rsquo;s not about &#8220;Progress&#8221;, it&rsquo;s about survival. One hundred years from now, the East Asian Civ could revert back to a pre-industrial society with rifle-wielding guys on horseback reminiscent of the colonial era. Would it matter? No. The point is that they would still be here. Would we? </p>
<p>Self-glorification of technologial prowess is useless other than to stroke the ego. This is why I always shake my head when people do this. Asians have less ego than Whites do (according to Rushton), but perhaps it has helped them. If Whites fade, E.Asia will rise to great prominence.</p>

<p>A very short-sighted observation. Of course the current situation is unsustainable. This has come about because it is technologically easier to build machines than to fully recycle their by-products. But as technology advances, there is no theoretical reason why we cannot have our cake and eat it too. The sun emits (&#8220;wastes&#8221;) an incredible amount of energy into empty space. If only a tiny fraction of that power could be harnessed and coupled with advanced material transformation technology, it will be possible to recreate any material or product totally from waste materials. A century from now, people will wonder what all the environmental hoopla was about.</p>
<p>Furthermore, only Whites (and perhaps also the Chinese) have shown the ability to limit their numbers in the face of prosperity and it is mainly Whites who have shown an organized concern for the environment.</p>
<p>Also, what makes you think that most people of the future will be living on Earth? There are so many lifeless plants out there just ripe for terraforming. </p>
<p>Lastly, unless life on Earth evolves to live on other planets, it will ultimately be doomed anyway as it is just a matter of time before a massive asteroid collision or other &#8220;natural&#8221; change renders the planet unfit to support life. And if the actions of Europeans are responsible for the extinction of some species, just how many species became extinct before humans even existed? </p>
<p>So, are Whites and the industrial revolution a threat to the animal world or are we its only hope for salvation?</p>
<p>Might I suggest you read Dr. William Pierce&rsquo;s &#8220;A White World&#8221;:</p>

<i>So we might begin our description of the sort of world we want by talking about the natural environment and the way in which our people should fit into that environment. We need, for one thing, a much lower average population density than we have now in North America and in Europe. Instead of a North America with a rapidly growing population of 300 million featherless bipeds of every known ethnicity, I have a vision of a continent with a stable population of 50 million European Americans   &mdash;   saner, healthier, stronger, better-looking, and more intelligent European Americans than is the norm for most parts of the continent today   &mdash;   and no non-Whites at all. And I have a vision of these 50 million White North Americans living and working in a land of regrown forests and unpolluted rivers and lakes and clean air: a land without litter along its roads and pathways and with bears and wolves and mountain lions and eagles returned to their natural habitats and forming once again a natural part of our environment. And in my vision a substantial part of these regrown forests and unpolluted rivers and lakes are in the public domain: in fact, a continuous public domain stretching from coast to coast between and around private holdings. And I envision no cities   &mdash;   certainly, none of the sprawling, noisy, congested, asphalt-and-concrete monstrosities surrounded by smoke-belching factories, clogged freeways, and honky-tonk strips with which we are all too familiar today. Towns with populations of no more than 10,000 should be adequate for commercial centers, manufacturing centers, educational centers, and any other sort of facility requiring the cooperative efforts of a couple of thousand people. I am assuming, of course, modern transportation, communication, and manufacturing methods. Even plants for smelting ore, producing steel, or making ball bearings, if designed and operated to take advantage of modern technological developments, should be able to do without the huge concentrations of labor used today.</i></p>

		<p>WhiteIsRight you are correct.  I&rsquo;m proud to be a part of the white race that developed the modern world - technological, medical, scientific, literary and philosophical innovations.  We were strong enough to conquer the Americas to expand our civilazation, against people who didn&rsquo;t have a written language and were just plain weaker.  We were strong enough to organize the slave trade, against people who were just weaker.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the 14th Amendment made the freed slaves citizens rather than being sent back to their homeland.  This was the beginning of the end.  Allowing European immigrants with Marxist leanings and two intra-race European civil wars in the 20th Century hastened our decline.  We need to break away from the American educational system and develop a network of home-schooling to teach young white children the truth about our glorious culture.    </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that non-whites live in harmony with nature, it&rsquo;s that they can&rsquo;t usually develop sufficient numbers (or technology) to cause much lasting damage. Hunter/gatherers would generally decimate a spot and move on, giving the area time to recover from the damage.

It is absurd to believe that humans, indeed white humans, are responsible for this. You have spent too much time watching pbs, and the discovery channel&rsquo;s slant on nature. As to the possibility of everyone becoming white and enjoying the same standard of living, the more likely scenario would be everyone becoming black and digressing to a black standard. I wonder if there were never any whites would the logical conclusion be the dino&rsquo;s would still rule the earth, and we&rsquo;d all be living in caves, with a life expectancy of maybe 20 years, with no recorded history, and we&rsquo;d not be having these discussions. Then your dream could come true and we&rsquo;d all be just savage animalist beings, overrun with voracious creatures and the earth would be pristine, and liberal utopia would reign supreme. Or the more likely scenario is humans would be extinct, and the monkeys would be at the top of the genetic chain, since they have the same level of logic as liberals.</p>

		<p>Deepak N Patel said: White people are responsible for the extinction of some of the most beautiful animal species that have ever walked on this earth. They began by destroying the vast herds of wildlife that were plentiful in their native homeland of Europe. After that, they moved on to other lands outside of Europe, and caused the extinction of other species in those lands. The extinct species are too numerous to list. The best known ones include the dodo, the European lion, the Eurasian Aurochs, and the Tasmanian Wolf.</p>
<p>Deepak, you can&rsquo;t be serious. Of course, it is not laughable that so much biodiversity is gone, but the idea that whitey is somehow more responsible for it than other human variants certainly is. Here&rsquo;s a basic primer on the extinctions that have followed in man&rsquo;s wake:</p>
<p>The least amount of extinction occurred in Africa. That&rsquo;s because the animals there evolved alongside of man - and learned to avoid man as he evolved into a hunter. Also large parts of Africa were essentially uninhabited by humans because of disease. </p>
<p>As human pushed their way into Europe, Asia and the Americas, vast extinctions followed - the animals there had not co evolved with man - they did not know to stay away, and so they were exterminated - and that was just as true for the fauna of Europe, like the Mammoth and the European Lion (whites), the fauna of Asia by, well, Asians, the faunas of Australia, like the Giant Kangaroo and the Marsupial Leopard by Aboriginals, and the faunas of the Americas like Mammoths and horses by the Amerinds. The last giant birds (Moas) in the world were exterminated by the Maori in New Zealand. The faunas thus exterminated are too numerous to list.</p>
<p>One further thing: Extinguishing biodiversity is something like slavery: All races have practiced it, but only one race took the lead in trying to stop it, and that&rsquo;s whites. If the Chinese ever rule the world you will see a tough and efficient world, but not one overly concerned with human rights or biodiversity. Other non white ruled possibilities are, of course, even worse.</p>
<p>If you disagree, think about this: Can you honestly see a well maintained wildlife refuge in a place like China or in an African state?</p>
<p>This answer is perhaps overlong, but its worth it.  I suggest a book. It&rsquo;s called 1491, and the author is Charles Mann. It&rsquo;s about the American Indians, and the impact that they had on the Americas - up until 1492 that is. Read it. Any romantic notions about noble natives and how they lived in harmony with nature will be dispelled. </p>

He omits the fact that the Maoris in New Zealand slaughtered all the moas - every species- to fill their bellies.

		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;4  &mdash;  Jay wrote at 9:53 PM on July 1 With all due respect, I have not met very many Asians who are capable of the kind of creativity that white people are capable of (a feat largely due to surviving the ice age through creative thinking which left us with this gift in great quantities). Most Indians I&rsquo;ve met are very nice and very hard workers, but ditto the creativity problem. Africans and latinos? You can address that better than I</p>
<p>Thank you for your civil and erudite response. I agree with you about whites being more creative (and possibly more intelligent) than other races. But that intelligence and creativity is what makes whites more dangerous to the planet, and I was speculating that nature may have devised a solution to prevent whites from attaining complete dominance of the planet, at the expense of other races and species. The ancient non-European civilizations you referred to, such as the Persians, the Babylonians, the Arabs, the Chinese, the Mayans, and the Aztecs, harmed the environment, but they did not cause the sort of damage that European industrial civilization did from 1700 to today. At the height of their power, those civilizations enjoyed a population boom, and caused mild levels of environmental damage. But when those civilizations collapsed, there was a rapid population decline, and the natural forests often reclaimed areas that had been under human settlement.</p>
<p>The Roman Empire followed the same path as those non-European civilizations. During the Pax Romana, and other times of peace and economic prosperity, there was a population boom. When the Roman Empire collapsed in 476 AD, the European population crashed, and natural forests were able to reclaim parts of Europe. But something different happened in around 1700, when Europeans created the modern industrial economy. They invented things like factories, steam locomotives, internal combustion engines, modern banking, modern capitalism, and other aspects of the industrial revolution. That changed the world forever.</p>
<p>Everybody in the world wants the stuff that white people have. The fact that not all races are capable of creating first world industrial societies, may be beneficial to the planet. I agree with those who mentioned India&rsquo;s overpopulation problem. In 1750, before India was colonized by the British, the total population of South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan) was 125 million. Today, the population has increased an amazing 12 times to 1.5 billion, because of the availability of Western medicines. That has been a disaster for the environment in the region, because beautiful animal species such as the Bengal Tiger are endangered. But J. Philippe Rushton said that India will never become a first world society like America, Western Europe, and Japan, because the average IQ in India is lower. But he believes China will reach first world status. Therefore, China will always be a bigger polluter than India, despite the fact that China has done a better job at population control. See Rushton&rsquo;s article on India: https://www.vdare.com/rushton/070926_indians.htm</p>
<p>In case someone thinks I am an environmental extremist, I refer you to the recent statement by the eminent Australian scientist, Prof. Frank Fenner, who predicted that human beings will be extinct in 100 years. He says that levels of consumption and population levels will be so high, thanks to European science, that the extremely high carbon-dioxide levels will kill off all humans. This issue is now being hotly debated in Australia, and here is a link to Fenner&rsquo;s claims: <a href="https://www.physorg.com/news196489543.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.physorg.com/news196489543.html</a></p>
<p>If Prof. Fenner is right, then the European-created industrial civilization that the whole world has adopted, will survive for only 400 years (1700 to 2100). Compare that to the 1000 years that Ancient Rome lasted, and to the 3000 years that the Chinese and Egyptian civilizations lasted. Aborigines arrived in Australia 50,000 years ago, at a time when the white race had not yet come into existence. When whites evolved in Europe 40,000 years ago, Aborigines had already been living in Australia for 10,000 years. Aborigine culture lasted 50,000 years, and they were living in harmony in nature, before whites discovered Australia. Don&rsquo;t you people think that a continous human culture lasting 50,000 years, is a wonderful thing? In case you think I am against all Europeans, I admire the fact that the first European humans, the Neanderthals, survived 300,000 years before they were wiped out by modern white people.</p>
<p>If what Prof. Fenner said is true, then European science and technology will cause all humans to be wiped from the face of the earth by 2100. If you believe that Prof. Fenner is being alarmist, you will still have to wonder whether European industrial civilization will be in existence 1,000 years from today, with the current (and higher) levels of consumption.</p>
<p>It is a fascinating intellectual exercise, to speculate where the world would be today, if white people had not come into existence. We could also imagine similar scenarios of a world without blacks, or Chinese, or Japanese, or Indians. In such an intellectual exercise, people should not take such imaginary scenarios personally, and be offended by them.</p>
<p>Whites are not worse than other humans, they are only more intelligent and more creative, and that factor makes them a greater danger to the environment. In a world without whites, humans would have lasted tens of thousands of years longer on this planet. I believe that non-whites would have eventually created the same science and technology that whites created, but at a much later date. The eventual outcome would have been the same, in that humans would have ended up destroying the planet and themselves, with their technology. </p>

The only reason I mention white people&rsquo;s creation of modern society, conquering the world and beauty is because so often you hear people like Margaret Wente say white people are dull and have no culture.  White people have culture and you are living in it.  Just as an example Japan, from the government to music to the educational system it&rsquo;s all based on Caucasian institutions and standards.</p>

Today Quebeckers make up less than 20 per cent of the Canadian population, and live in the poorest province of them all. &#8220;</p>
<p><br>
I am a Quebecker, and I truly feel the urge to say: don&rsquo;t bury us too soon, Margaret Wente!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an old fantasy of Anglo-Canadians, that imaginary Canada in which we would no longer exist&hellip; And they so love to believe they are smarter, and possess some sort of moral superiority, compared to Americans!</p>
<p>Our birth rate is now greater than that of white people in Ontario, among other places&hellip; And we have the greatest proportion of citizens with a post-secondary education, in Canada. By far.</p>
<p>If you take away the main provinces that are, today, Québec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, Canada looks like some kind of huge northern banana republic, anyway&hellip; A country the United States military considers not even worth it to nuke, their experts said!</p>
<p>Furthermore, does this Wente character really think that the national Canadian IQ could be high, if it were to become populated mostly by the kind of Third World  people that&rsquo;s now coming to Canada at the rate of many thousands every month? Those races, or ethnic groups (call them what you will) just developed societies in their image, in the Third World! Again, the myth that there is nothing genetic about intelligence, that the countries from which they come from are poor because it is the Evil White Man that has been keeping all those people down for millennia&hellip;</p>
<p>Wente&rsquo;s description of this future for Canada, should make White people everywhere, think very seriously about immigration and its consequences!</p>

		<p>WhiteIsRight, you&rsquo;re misinterpreting what was written. Ms Wente is not saying that White people have no culture, she just thought the existing culture in Canada was &#8220;boring&#8221; 50 years ago, from her perspective as a child and as a new immigrant.</p>
<p>Whatever the opinion anyone has about the author, the trends she lays out are here to stay. Canada will become older, more populous, less White and economically uncertain (i.e., going the way of the USA). No amount of chest-thumping and talk about a White heyday is going to change anything; it&rsquo;s the same thing over and over that accomplishes nothing but establish a false sense of security and superiority, in the face of reality which is increasing White vulnerability.</p>
<p>You describe E.Asians as being passive-aggressive and haughty, but the truth is that those descriptors easily apply to the members of AR too. Asians are disliked not because of those traits, but because they pose the most direct challenge to Whites relative to other races. After all, the vast majority of America&rsquo;s major wars were fought against East Asian powers (Japan - War in the Pacific; China &amp; Korea - Korean War; Vietnamese - Vietnam War). No other non-White entity was capable of doing so. </p>
<p>However, don&rsquo;t let the lens of race cloud your judgement. Asians are not the ones responsible for what is happening to America and Canada today. China may be a beneficiary, but is not who we should be wary of. Anger needs to be directed at our own government, banks and multinational corporations for selling out.</p>

I also wouldn&rsquo;t be so confident as to your people&rsquo;s ability to survive, let alone remain a majority in Quebec, should current immigration patterns continue.  Montreal is all but lost to the Third Worlders who have rapidly transformed that beautiful city into an almost foreign entity where French and English Quebecers are not made to feel welcome.  I would hate to see Quebec continue to go that route and desire nothing more than a strong, proud Quebec, independent if need be.

Re :If what Prof. Fenner said is true, then European science and technology will cause all humans to be wiped from the face of the earth by 2100. <br>
I would not be quite so sure the rise of Asianismus ( as the Germans might say) will be without massive casualties. White warfare was relatively humane until someone called Hitler began to engage in Mongolian tactics towards his fellow whites in the East. <br>
 The one overlooked aspect of WW2 which troubles me still is the seriousness of Japanese attempts to implement bacteriological warfare. It is not well known that the Japanese had plans to infect the west coast of the USA with bacteriological agents, and would have, were it not for the atomic bomb.They also murdered hundreds of thousands of Chinese with bacteriological agents during the war, as is well known.<br>
  If we are to engage in generalities about races let&rsquo;s take a look at Asian cold-bloodedness. And shall we forget that China is harboring plans to colonize Africa, also? I don&rsquo;t think we can assume the Africans will be consulted about this. </p>

		<p>Reply to Francois:</p>
<p>I have many different thoughts regarding your post. Firstly Quebec&rsquo;s share of Canada&rsquo;s total population is declining and this is due almost entirerly to immigration, which is nearly all from the third world. For instance in 1971, when Canada&rsquo;s population was about 21,000,000 Quebec had 27.94% of the country&rsquo;s population. Today Canada has grown to 34,000,000 and Quebec has just 23.18% of this figure. A similar trend for another four decades would put Quebec at a little over 18%. Now as to WHY this is all happening the answer is simply that Canada is being flooded with black, brown and yellow people from countries that have no historic connection to Canadians at all. The PARADOX is that while immigration is very bad for Quebec, because it undermines her demographically, she is almost fully responsible for it. It was the federal Liberal party that wanted mass non-White immigration and started it in 1967. It was Pierre Trudeau who oversaw it and developed it into an art form. Now who did French-Canadians traditionally always support? The liberals of course. The very party that has worked to weaken them. Quebec always gave its seats to Trudeau. It was only the Francophone tribal vote that saved him in the 1972 election when the rest of Canada wanted to dump him. 1972 also saw a huge increase in the number of immigrants even though the economy was then in a funk. So Quebec has been hoisted on its own petard. It historically supported and voted for a party and political figure who worked completely against its own best interests. What French-Canadians really needed was an immigration-restrictionist party. Instead they voted for and largely were responsible for keeping in power a party that promoted the exact opposite policy. </p>

<p>Thank you very much, Watchtower.</p>
<p>Now, you see, when I wrote about our birth rate, I was referring specifically to OUR French Canadian birth rate, Watch. For we actually have been enjoying a small baby-boom, here. Especially visible in our capital city of Québec, where I live (and where there are very, very few Third World people).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been here for a little over four centuries, and we have learned to adapt, while staying ourselves, in the face of adversity. </p>
<p>And most of us understand what the Charest government are up to, with their massive immigration policy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad, really, Watchtower: it could have been a great, great country, with you and we working side by side&hellip; instead of despising each other, and competing against each other, as though we had been pure strangers in the same country&hellip; </p>
<p>Ironically, this official multicutural thing we now have in our Canadian constitution, and which is turning Canada into some huge Third World slum, is the brainchild of Pierre Elliot Trudeau. He has said that he wanted to prevent Québec becoming an independant state- at any cost!</p>
<p>Trudeau tried to drown us in a flood of Third World migrants. While he focused solely on that, he failed to foresee the result of his new constitution!</p>
<p>In a way, I feel sorry for your people, Watchtower, because Trudeau worked quite hard to prevent us from getting our own country, but in order to do so, he scuttled yours!</p>
<p>Take care.</p>

<p>Trudeau dreamed of an imaginary, impossible Canada: bilingual from coast to coast, and socialist while located right next to the largest and most powerful capitalist country in the world. But for that Canada to exist, Quebec had to stay in the Canadian Confederation, of course&hellip;</p>
<p>When we realized what kind of character P. E. T. was (a traitor to us, and a close friend of Fidel Castro), Quebeckers began to more and more vote for the Tories (who had gradually become much more Quebec-friendly).</p>
<p>Trudeau said that he wanted us to stay within Canada- whatever the cost! he, who was so hated by American presidents Nixon and Reagan for his prima dona attitude and his communist allegiance, wanted to drown us in a sea of immigrants&hellip; He failed!</p>
<p>Yes, the bastard tried to drown us, but all he did was scuttle your precious Canada!</p>
<p>It is your people, Anonymous, who had the last chance to stop him, in 1982, when he wanted the prime ministers from all the provinces to sign his new constitution- but you were so focused on hating us (René Lévesque, ou own p.m., had left the negotiations table), that you totally failed to see what you were going to turn Canada into!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you go trying to blame us! The lack of vision was yours, entirely! And we were only doing what we had, in order to survive.</p>

<p>The association that brings about your conclusion is that between whites and industrialism. Yes, it is true that whites are the creators of the industrial world, this cannot be denied.  However, to claim that if whites immediately vanished that such capabilities would vanish with us is, to be sure, a fantasy.</p>
<p>The Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Indians (Your own people) and indeed others now also hold these capabilities. Surely then, and perhaps against the feelings and rhetoric of many of my fellow amren posters, industrial civilization is no longer ours alone to carry forward.</p>
<p>You assert that we whites have many admirable features, and say many kind things about our breed. Yet you have seemingly only evil feelings for our future, you want all of our admitted qualities annihilated. It is easy to see, for any man, that your conclusions were drawn not from a foundation of inquiry and interest but of jealousy and malevolence. A sort of &#8220;hate your betters&#8221; narrative that is entirely all too common among the dark skinned masses of this world.</p>

<p>You sir are absolutely and completely wrong. It was QUEBEC that kept the federal liberal party in power. And ONLY Quebec. It was almost impossible for any of the other &#8220;grotesquely racist&#8221; (whatever you say buddy) parties to gain power after spotting the liberals 70-75 seats in la belle province. It WAS TRUDEAU who oversaw and masterminded the mass immigration of non-Whites to Canada. He was a FRANCOPHONE, just like you. He was from QUEBEC just like you. Quebec overwhelmingly supported him and the liberals. You can say ANYTHING you want sir, but the voting facts are a part of the historical record. In 1968 P.E.T. got only 45% of the national vote (his highest ever), mostly from Quebec. In 1972 he was overwhelmingly rejected in every single province EXCEPT FOR QUEBEC. It was the FRANCOPHONE TRIBAL VOTE IN QUEBEC ALONE that kept him in power. Had Anglo Canada had its way this miserable excuse would have been gone right then and there. In the 1974, 1979 and 1980 elections Quebec overwhelmngly supported Trudeau and the liberals. THIS IS A HISTORICAL FACT SIR. They never would have been able to form a national government without your tribal support. The result? The country was flooded with non-Whites and ruined. You guys chose to vote for a man who implemented the war powers act and put Montreal under martial law. You guys voted for a guy who shoved the constitution on us. Francophones need to take responsibility for their disastrous role in the Trudeau-liberal created wreckage that is Canada.</p>
