<h1>Violence in Mexico Escalates With Fatal Car Bombing</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sara A. Carter, Washington Examiner, July 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Several episodes of drug-related violence have claimed dozens of lives in Mexico in recent days, but the detonation of a car bomb of the type that has afflicted U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan has law enforcement officials on both sides of the border especially concerned.</p>
<p>The detonation in Ciudad Juarez late last week that killed three people lured into an ambush is expected to be only the beginning of an escalating war that has moved from gun battles to remote controlled explosives, officials said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Iraq the game changed after the first [Improvised Explosive Device] was detonated,&#8221; said a military official who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. &#8220;We saw the same thing in Afghanistan. I expect the drug cartels in Mexico will follow in the same footsteps. It&rsquo;s only going to get worse when they get so brazen, and it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me in the least if we see this being done more often.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The car bombing last week was only one among numerous bloody incidents across Mexico this past week.</p>
<p>Five factory workers near the U.S. border and four police officers in Acapulco were killed over the weekend.</p>
<p>Another 17 people were gunned down and more than 18 others injured at a birthday party in Torreon in Northern Mexico on Friday. Armed gunmen began a rampage, firing at guests indiscriminately, according to reports in the Mexican press.</p>
<p>More than 7,000 people have been killed so far this year in drug-related violence in Mexico, an escalation of the violence that claimed 9,000 lives for all of 2009.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m waiting for the govermedia to start pushing the party line that Mexican chaos is somehow all the fault of White, gun-owning amerikan Racists.  And that the only cure is to bring all the Mexicans here, where they can blossom into heart surgeons and nuclear physicists under our precious blanket of Democracy.<br>

<p>Waiting?  It was essentially the media party line through the first half of last year.  The State Prosecutors in Phoenix went so far as to trump up charges against a Phoenix dealer, which a state judge dismissed summarily and with prejudice:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/256crjb" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/256crjb</a></p>
<p>The only error in that post is that I said that the US Attorneys filed charges.  It had to be the State DA or CA or SA, because it was dismissed in state court in Maricopa County.</p>
<p>The ruling class&rsquo;s propaganda mouths posing as &#8220;journalists&#8221; are still repeating the lie on occasion to this day, even though it&rsquo;s been proven to be not true.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;More than 7,000 people have been killed so far this year in drug-related violence in Mexico, an escalation of the violence that claimed 9,000 lives for all of 2009.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which means if the rate of murders continues, by the end of this year, there will be about 14,000 people killed for the entire year of 2010, make a two year grand total of 23,000.</p>
<p>That means that the number of drug deaths per annum is greater than the US suffered during the wars in Vietnam, Iraq, and now Afghanistan.  In other words, Mexico is in a high intensity war right now, just short of all out civil war. </p>
<p>And, if Hezbollah-type car bombs are now being seen in Mexico the recent CIA intelligence allegations, revealing that the jihadists are infiltrating Mexico and are being assisted by the drug cartels, is very likely true.  And, in return, the jihadists want help in entering the US.</p>
<p>If car bombs start going off in the US with the same frequency they do in the Middle East, there will be mass panic, and we won&rsquo;t have to wait until Obama&rsquo;s incompetence sends us into history&rsquo;s Greatest Depression, because it will begin overnight right after the first terrorist attack.</p>
<p>After that it will be impeachment time for failing to protect our southern border.</p>

<p>If? I would say its a matter of when, eventually the end distributors in USA will have to take on local and federal law enforcement organizations. The car bomb will be followed by the roadside IED - police cruisers and SWAT vans are conviently marked and way more vulnerable to roadside bombs than the heavily armored vehicles used in Iraq and Afghanistan. Eventually there will be no-go zones where only observation by police agents in civilian garb is possible and not direct action. For all practical purpouses these zones will be foriegn states on ex american territory. </p>
<p>So why isnt the US government doing any preventive measures? The most likely reason is that its real goal is to have a pretext for an explicit police state in the USA. Its pretty obvious that the real power in USA isnt elected nor answerable to the people but only beholden to itself. The president, the congress and the senate are second string hired helpers and not the power brokers they pose as. Turning USA into a police state would only be a formality because the vast majority of americans are already owned, indebted or otherwise captured by the real power of the land. </p>

		<p>The cartels make 80% of their profit from Marijuana. Legalize pot, no more profits for the cartels,and problem solved. But our asinine government won&rsquo;t do that because of the payouts from the pharmaceuticals, tobacco, and alcohol suppliers, who know that THEIR toxic substance supplying business will be cut about 80%. They are the world&rsquo;s biggest drug dealers, not the cartels.</p>

		<p>To ranger and Information Insurgent:</p>
<p>If, or when car bombs go off in the U.S.A., Obama will have had it. He&rsquo;s wetting his panties, hoping that no such bombs will go off before November 2, which is Election Day. That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s sending 1,200 troops and agents to the border. He&rsquo;s afraid that if the cartels do explode such a device in our territory, his political goose is cooked. It will validate what Arizona has done, and might spur other states to follow suit.</p>
<p>The Obama regime did absolutely nothing, during the Mexican swine flu situation, except tell Americans not to judge Mexicans. Why should we expect him to do anything now?</p>
<p>Americans for their part, can boycott Mexico by simply not going there and spending money. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, Acapulco beaches and Tijuana donkey shows are simply not worth it.</p>
<p>May we live in interesting times.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another good reason to be a tee totaler when it comes to Mexico:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/24kmurp" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/24kmurp</a></p>
<p>The article doesn&rsquo;t say this, but I think the Mex. Gov. is using the white American as a pawn against SB 1070.  Prediction:  Next spring break, a lot of white American teenagers and young adults that go to Cancun and Tijuana and Acapulco will be kidnapped by the Mexican &#8220;authorities,&#8221; based on planted drugs/guns, and be left to rot in Mexican hoosegows, until 1070 style laws are repealed.  Obama/HRC (nor any of the open borders Republican President/Sec. of State. combos that could well replace them) will lift a finger.</p>

		<p>Can we just legalize marijuana already?  This is absurd.  BTW, they decriminalized (not the same as legal) ALL drugs in Portugal and drug use did not go up at all.  </p>
<p>People who want to do drugs will do so whether it is illegal or not.  Making it legal will NOT increase the number of drug users.  It will simply decrease the violence and crime associated with the drug trade.  </p>

		<p>I think incidents like this one are an eventual certainty in the United States.  The Mexican narcos are already threatening US cops with reprisals if they pay &#8220;too close&#8221; attention to whom and what is crossing the border.  Mexico&rsquo;s last civil war lasted from 1910 to 1920 and killed 10% of the nation&rsquo;s population.  What we are seeing now is an intensification of the conflict between the narcos and their equally corrupt counterparts in the Mexican etsablishment that will not cease until the establishment decides to co-opt the narcos, or the narcos replace Mexico&rsquo;s kleptocratic elites as a new, corrupt establishment.  This conflict recently earned Mexico the sobriquet &#8220;failed state&#8221; from analysts in the US Pentagon.  If a new civil war there produces casualties on the same scale as the last, the result will be 11 million killed and a refugee crisis that will utterly destroy the economies of Guatemala and the USA.</p>
