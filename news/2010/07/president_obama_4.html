<h1>President Obama, White House: Al Qaeda Is Racist</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jake Tapper, ABC News, July 13 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In an interview earlier today with the South African Broadcasting Corporation to air in a few hours, President Obama disparaged al Qaeda and affiliated groups&rsquo; willingness to kill Africans in a manner that White House aides say was an argument that the terrorist groups are racist.</p>
<p>Speaking about the Uganda bombings, the president said, &#8220;What you&rsquo;ve seen in some of the statements that have been made by these terrorist organizations is that they do not regard African life as valuable in and of itself.  They see it as a potential place where you can carry out ideological battles that kill innocents without regard to long-term consequences for their short-term tactical gains.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Explaining the president&rsquo;s comment, an administration official said Mr. Obama &#8220;references the fact that both U.S. intelligence and past al Qaeda actions make clear that al Qaeda  &mdash;  and the groups like al Shabaab that they inspire  &mdash;  do not value African life. The actions of al Qaeda and the groups that it has inspired show a willingness to sacrifice innocent African life to reach their targets.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Additionally, U.S. intelligence has indicated that al Qaeda leadership specifically targets and recruits black Africans to become suicide bombers because they believe that poor economic and social conditions make them more susceptible to recruitment than Arabs,&#8221; the official said. &#8220;Al Qaeda recruits have said that al Qaeda is racist against black members from West Africa because they are only used in lower level operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In short,&#8221; the official said, &#8220;al Qaeda is a racist organization that treats black Africans like cannon fodder and does not value human life.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I happened to be driving around on business during the hour Rush was dealing with this story.  As I could think of every funny cliche in my head, Rush was saying it.  We must be long lost distant cousins.</p>
<p>All I can add is that AQ has a glass ceiling that black men are unable to bomb their way through.  Since we kill the #3 in AQ every other week, many AQ management positions are open.  If they don&rsquo;t get them, then black Qaedas can bring a disparate impact lawsuit in the Federal courts, which might have to end in a consent decree.</p>

		<p>The community organizer is no different in his mindset than Jeremiah Wright and his racist congregants in his church.  They are TOTALLY absorbed with race.  The post racial president has demonstrated that he is no more than a liar in everything he claimed to stand for that had overtones of reasonableness, especially his claims of wanting a post-racial country.</p>
<p>Rush Limbaugh has implied that the reason this man wanted to be president was to &#8220;get back&#8221; at this country and its white population&hellip;both of whom he detests&hellip;. for their erroneously perceived ongoing oppression and racism the community organizer and his friends at Unity Church and other racist organizations around the country are delusional and fixated about, even though white oppression and racism is at its lowest ebb ever, and black bias and racial hatred are increasing every day.  </p>
<p>It seems the more privileges blacks get the more they hate us and the more arrogant they become in thinking they should be in charge, not whites.</p>
<p>Unlike Wright and his following at his church, Obama is more careful about being too overtly anti-white and anti-USA, but his hatred is revealed from time to time for all to see in various ways, as in his condemnation of the police arrest of a ghetto talking black at Harvard; his desire to invoke cap and trade principles, health care mandates and quotas in every aspect of legislation that is passed by this fawning Congress.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only scary it&rsquo;s hard to believe white politicians, the military and the general population is not taking up arms and demanding he be impeached immediately before he opens up concentration camps for whites, because most whites are now aware of just where he&rsquo;s coming from and all his campaign rhetoric was nothing but abject lies.</p>
<p>As this situation continues heading toward some very dangerous times, and it is very possible we might just see this country implode economically overnight, because there are several different economic catastrophes that could occur at any given moment right this very minute.  Economic collapse equates to social unrest without doubt.</p>
<p>If that happens we just might see an immediate impeachment regime change, which will cause this country to totally erupt.  Having an anti-white, anti-US protagonist at the helm is going to be quite a handicap for whites to overcome in the following months.  </p>
<p>With everything falling down around him, I think this community organizer is following the road to impeachment in nearly everything he says and does.</p>

		<p>Osama was heard in one video referring to blacks as the abd! Meaning black house slave as I understand it. The Arabic word for black African or black period is abd, again, black house slave. The numbers of black African Christians murdered by Muslims is just stupendous, especially in the southern part of the Sudan. Millions or so. And in Nigeria, the Christians there know what the score is. And are prepared to use violence in return for the murder and mayhem directed against them by the Muslim of their own countries.</p>

<p>Talk about dancing around an issue, with all the grace of some multicultural hippo that has smoked some truly strong marijuana?</p>
<p>What is so obvious, which Comrade BO and his merry band of Bolsheviks and slithering lackeys just do not have the guts to say is that these terrorist groups see blacks as: not being human, fully exploitable because of this, and otherwise utterly worthless. Instead they play a childishly coy game of groveling at the &ldquo;good&rdquo; Muslim world&rsquo;s feet and then expecting to earn &ldquo;respect&rdquo; from them for doing so. They then compound their tangibly and gutless stupidity, by expecting that these &ldquo;good&rdquo; Muslims will eventually restrain their most overtly homicidal elements by labeling them as &ldquo;racists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oddly, the fact that they mostly target Christian and Jewish people in their atrocities, is totally lost on them. Only the fact that Africans do not find acceptance into leadership positions in an al Qaeda affirmative action program, seems to remotely crack their helmets of multicultural sanctimony and uncommon-sense.</p>
<p>In the end, what do you expect?</p>

<p>lol, Obama&rsquo;s rhetoric sounds a bit like something out of the cold war. Where the Soviets would appeal to non-whites by portraying themselves as champions of persons of color. Only they understood the struggle. </p>

		<p> If al Qaeda&rsquo;s setting off of bombs that killed many black Africans proves that the Islamic terrorists are &#8220;racist,&#8221; then what does their setting off of bombs that have killed literally many hundreds of Arabs, Afghans, Americans, Europeans, Indonesians, in the last two decades, prove?</p>
<p> Obama&rsquo;s words prove that he is in fact either (a) clueless; (b) determined to turn everything possible into &#8220;racism&#8221; practiced against the blacks that make up half of his heritage; or (c) both. My money&rsquo;s on (c).</p>

		<p>There is friction among Muslims: Arabs don&rsquo;t like blacks (and Turks are not too fond of Arabs) but there is nothing in Islam that is racist, and it is just foolishness to call hyper-Islamists like AQ racist. Obama is just trying to insult AQ, and like most black Americans, he knows no worse insult than &#8220;racist&#8221;, so that is the insult he uses. AQ sucks because they want to kill Americans, not because they are racist.</p>

		<p>The funny thing is that he follows the old line about &#8220;poor blacks&#8221; that the commies have used since the 1920&rsquo;s.  Poor blacks are prone to being easily manipulated into becoming suicide bombers&hellip;.really?  Or is it more like poor muslims are?</p>

		<p>The Obama administration treats white Americans as cannon fodder in Afghanistan. Where&rsquo;s their great regard for them? He&rsquo;s apparently more concerned about Africans than he is about Americans. Perhaps he&rsquo;s just confused and thinks he&rsquo;s the president of Kenya. </p>

<p>Considering Africa&rsquo;s past history, I would have to say that Africans themselves don&rsquo;t see African life as valuable in and of itself. In fact, the only ones who seem to care whether black Africans live or die are white Western liberals. Africans are constantly murdering each other with machetes, burning witches, staging massacres and otherwise killing each other off with cheerful, bloody abandon. Of course, I doubt if Obama really cares that much about them himself. He&rsquo;s just pandering to his audience as usual, mouthing lines written by somebody like Morty Zuckerman before moving on to his next fiasco.</p>

		<p>Now that al Qaeda bombed those people in Uganda, Obama has the cajones to label them as &#8220;racist&#8221;. Maybe he expects them to back down by doing so. Or, he could get Jesse Jackson to threaten them with a shakedown.</p>
<p>Obama is a hypocrite in that, never once did he condemn the Somali pirates as &#8220;racists&#8221; who were, and still are, disrupting international shipping routes around the Horn of Africa. They&rsquo;re his soul brothers.</p>
<p>As Bush pointed out in the aftermath of 9-11, terrorists don&rsquo;t care WHO they kill when they commit their acts. Americans, Asians, Europeans, Hispanics and blacks were all killed in the 9-11 attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&#8221;, you are wrong when you say &#8220;there is nothing in Islam that is racist&#8221;&hellip; To the contrary, the Koran refers to blacks as &#8220;stinking monkeys&#8221;, and sanctions slavery (&#8220;possessing their necks&#8221;). While millions of blacks slaves, mostly from West Africa, were sent to the New World as slaves, many more millions were sent to the Middle East from East Africa, primarily to serve in the harems of the sultans.</p>
<p>You are right about Obama hoping to insult al-Qaeda by hurling the &#8220;racist&#8221; canard at them, thinking they&rsquo;ll back off. What an idiot, he is. He forgets he&rsquo;s dealing with Arabs, not Americans. That dog won&rsquo;t hunt.</p>
<p>John PM, isn&rsquo;t it ironic that Obama calls al-Qaeda &#8220;racist&#8221; for bombing blacks in Uganda, while being silent about all their other (non-black) victims? This is the man who bowed to al-Qaeda&rsquo;s bankrollers, the king of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>May we live in interesting times. </p>

=====================</p>
<p>Liberals like to pretend that Al-Quaeda is a &#8220;peoples&rsquo; movement&#8221; of poor, uneducated, destitute, trampled upon oppressed peoples opposing the white imperialist global order. </p>
<p>Really the typical Al-Quaeda Jihadi as shown by the 9-11 hijackers,  are over educated middle class to wealthy Arabs who go to Western Universities and develop inferiority complexes due to the superiority of Western Civilization.</p>
<p>As far as he Uganda bomobing, jeeze Uganda is the home of Idi Amin, and the Lords Resistance Army. They really need Arabs to get them to kill each other?</p>

		<p>Like Sharpton and Jackson, Obama seems to react to people&rsquo;s mistreatment, real or imagined, only when these people are black.  It&rsquo;s incredible that he shows no better decorum than this, when he&rsquo;s supposed to be the post-racial President.  Apparently, he really has given up all hope of another term and has decided to just stick it to whitey as long as he can.  </p>

		<p>In theory, if not in actual practice, Islam is totally and unswervingly color-blind.</p>
<p>Hence Khaled bin Sultan bin Abdul-Aziz As-Saud, the Saudi Ambassador to the U.S.A., being the son of a Sudani &#8220;palace servant&#8221; mother and very obviously at least as much a black African as a peninsular Arab.</p>
<p>A feature of Arab slavery which will interest readers here; an Arab boy of the ruling class was traditionally given a black slave boy of his own age to be his personal servant and playmate; the two boys having grown up together, it goes without saying that the Arab boy - by now a young man - would trust his own slave far more than he would trust his cousins or even his brothers. </p>
<p>Hence the rather startling accounts of blacks as generals of armies, admirals of fleets and governors of provinces.</p>
<p>I feel sure it was Thesiger rather than Philby who was outraged that a local governor, a slave of the House of Saud, kept him standing outside a fort gate in the cold winter rain of Asir.</p>

<p>Paisan, the conflict in Sudan, is between two black factions, NOT between black Christians and Arab Muslims. The so-called Janjweed militia, is actually an Arabic-speaking black tribe.</p>
<p>In fact, the president of Sudan, Omar Bashir, is coal-black, and resembles Al Roker. Thus, the situation in Sudan is yet another black-on-black tribal conflict, that we have seen played out, over and over on the continent, for decades.</p>
<p>Think of it as the Sudanese Crips v. the Sudanese Bloods.</p>
<p>People who wring their hands over Darfur attempt to portray it as a race conflict, between the black Christians of Darfur, being slaughtered by Arab horsemen (with the Chinese overlords in the background). </p>

<p>The president of Sudan is black. Incidentally, I came up with the term &#8220;coal-black&#8221; as a counter to the term &#8220;lily-white&#8221;, which some people use contemptuously to denote a virtually all-Caucasian situation. So I came up with &#8220;coal-black&#8221;. It doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with pigmentation, but with the fact of something being predominantly black. Consider:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jamarcus and Willie live in a coal-black neighborhood in Boston&#8221;.</p>
