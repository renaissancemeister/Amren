			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Newsmax, July 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Without the benefit of their state&rsquo;s strict new immigration law, officers from a single Arizona county helped deport more than 26,000 immigrants from the U.S. through a federal-local partnership program that has been roundly criticized as fraught with problems.</p>
<p>Statistics obtained by The Associated Press show that the Maricopa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office was responsible for deportations or forced departure of 26,146 immigrants since 2007.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about a quarter of the national total of 115,841 sent out of the U.S. by officers in 64 law enforcement agencies deputized to help enforce immigration laws, some since 2006, under the so-called 287(g) program.</p>
<p>The tens of thousands of immigrant arrests show local officials already have a significant amount of authority to enforce immigration laws and help remove illegal immigrants from the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are several other ways local officials can assist, including Secure Communities, a more widely used program that allows local officials to check the fingerprints of anyone they book into their jails against FBI and Homeland Security Department databases.</p>
<p>But the 287(g) program gives officers the most direct authority to stop people on the street, in their cars or in their communities and check whether they are in the country illegally. Federal watchdogs have been critical of the job the Homeland Security Department has been doing in running the program.</p>
<p>The department&rsquo;s inspector general reported in March that the 287(g) program was poorly supervised and provided insufficient training to officers, including on civil rights law.</p>
<p>Local officers have operated outside their agreements dictating the limits of their authority, the report said. In all, the inspector general made 33 recommendations for overhauling the program, some of which have not yet been resolved. It was the second critical report for the program. The Government Accountability Office had criticized the program in July 2009.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arpaio has denied the allegations and says he is a target because of his tough immigration enforcement. His office has continued to do immigration sweeps. Arpaio said he is enforcing state anti-smuggling and anti-illegal immigrant hiring laws.</p>
<p>Arpaio said about 100 of his deputies were trained over five weeks to act as federal agents under the 287(g) program. They were trained on racial profiling and other civil rights laws, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The federal government does not pay for local officers to participate in the 287(g) program. U.S. taxpayers pay the federal cost, which has grown from $5 million in 2006 to $68 million in 2010, according to the DHS inspector general. Immigration and Customs Enforcement reimburses some of the local agencies for housing immigrants in their jails. The immigrants can be in the country illegally or legally present but have committed a crime that makes them eligible for deportation.</p>

		<p>The whole Obama-instigated uproar over the AZ law is just window dressing to please liberals and pro-illegal Hispanics.  For years, officials like Arpaio have been going about the business of getting illegal criminals deported with the cooperation of federal authorities.  And Obama isn&rsquo;t going to do anything to stop such actions.</p>

		<p>Sheriff Joe is 78 yrs. old right now.  I&rsquo;m wondering how long he intends to work before he retires.  He looks like he&rsquo;s in pretty good shape; he&rsquo;s articulate&rsquo; and he&rsquo;s still pretty agile, so here&rsquo;s hoping he can maintain his health and stay in office for at least 4 or 5 more years.</p>

What is this &#8220;ALLOWS local officials to check the fingerprints&hellip;?&#8221; Maybe I am mistaken but I thought they did this ANYWAY as a matter of course. I am under the assumption that if you arrested and taken to jail, they fingerprint you and run you for warrants. Am I wrong?<br>
Also, checking somebody&rsquo;s prints against FBI and Homeland Security Department databases won&rsquo;t catch someone who has sneaked across the border and hasn&rsquo;t been arrested yet.<br>
Red Herrings, smoke and mirrors, appeasment of most ignorant masses.  </p>

		<p>Sheriff Joe is a wonder. One man against the world almost. And he succeeds where others fail. HOW is one man able to do what he is while the others either don&rsquo;t even try or just do the minimal if that?</p>
<p>Just from one county 25 % of the whole? Phenomenal. Shows WHAT can be done. YES! And these persons deported are primarily if not exclusively CRIMINALS? I think so. NO abuse, just common sense.</p>

		<p>Arpaio is a true American hero. With a few more good men like him (and women like Brewer!) we could clean up this country.</p>

		<p>If one medium size department actually trying is accounting for 1/4 of the illegals deported, it shows me the rest of the system isn&rsquo;t trying at all. Not that I believed that it was trying with a full effort, but I expect more than 100K deportations, even from a weak effort. We need something more akin to 2-3 million deportations a year to even hit the break even point. </p>

		<p>It is pretty sad that only one law enforcement agency in America is actively deporting illegal aliens. According to the article -only about 100,000 illegal aliens nationwide have been deported by law enforcement agencies since 2006. Somehow the Maricopa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office has managed to deport about 25% of these people. The article says that there are 64 law enforcement agencies that are &#8220;trained&#8221; to deport illegal aliens. If they had all deported the same number as Sheriff Joe then 64 times 26,000 equals 1,664,000 illegal aliens that we would be rid off ( until they snuck in again). </p>

		<p>I just returned from a 1 year tour in Korea.  Everyone who thinks that a border cannot be secured is lying.  Regardless of the diplomatic fallout, I for one in king for a day, would detail the entire National Guard both Army and Air to provide direct support and aid in the actual building effort.  I would have only 1 border crossing per state&hellip;that&rsquo;s it, not one more.  Plus, one must remember the adage that any obstacle not covered by either direst or indirect fire&hellip;is not an obstacle.  It would take approximately 12 months to do this.</p>

		<p>According to WikiAnswers, there are 3009 counties, 64 parishes, 16 boroughs and 41 independent municipalities in this country, so why is Sheriff Joe having to carry so much of the load? This is nonsense, and I am going to be on the phone to my sheriff first thing Monday morning to find out what he&rsquo;s been doing.</p>
