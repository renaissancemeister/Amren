<h1>RCMP Discriminated Against Muslim Cadet, Court Rules</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kenyon Wallace, National Post (Toronto), July 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The RCMP engaged in racial and religious discrimination when it expelled a Muslim man from its cadet academy, the Federal Court of Appeal has ruled, paving the way for the man&rsquo;s return to training 11 years after his dismissal.</p>
<p>The decision upholds a finding by a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in 2008 that Ali Tahmourpour, 37, faced verbal abuse and hostility from instructors, ridicule over his wearing of religious jewellery, and poor performance evaluations while enrolled in the RCMP&rsquo;s Regina cadet academy (known as the Depot).</p>
<p>&#8220;I finally have vindication,&#8221; Mr. Tahmourpour told the National Post from his Mississauga home, saying he intends to return to the academy to fulfill his dream of becoming a member of the RCMP. &#8220;My great-grandfather was a mounted police chief in the western mountains of Persia, so it runs in the family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Tahmourpour&rsquo;s training contract was terminated in October 1999, about 14 weeks into the RCMP&rsquo;s 22-week cadet course for what the force said were weaknesses in communication skills, group participation, and ability to handle stress, among other things. Because of these alleged problems, a recommendation was made that he not be permitted to re-enrol.</p>
<p>Ruling his termination was based &#8220;discriminatory assessments of Mr. Tahmourpour&rsquo;s skills&#8221; and that the decision to prevent his return to the academy was &#8220;based in part on his race, religion and/or ethnic or national background,&#8221; the Tribunal ordered Mr. Tahmourpour&rsquo;s reinstatement. But the Mounties challenged that decision last year in Federal Court, where a judge set aside the order and sent the complaint back to the Tribunal for a rehearing.</p>
<p>Mr. Tahmourpour appealed that judgment to the Court of Appeal, where Justice Karen Sharlow this week upheld the Tribunal&rsquo;s 2008 ruling, stating the RCMP&rsquo;s &#8220;discriminatory treatment of Mr. Tahmourpour denied him the opportunity to complete his training at the Depot and to make his living as an RCMP officer.&#8221;</p>
<p>She referred only one aspect of the Tribunal&rsquo;s original ruling to be reconsidered, that of a part of the compensation awarded to Mr. Tahmourpour to make up for lost income.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the RCMP said she could not comment on the ruling as it is under review by the force.</p>
<p>The Iranian-born Mr. Tahmourpour says his troubles began on the first day of training when he was singled out by his instructors for asking to wear a religious pendant during physical education class. He testified that one officer, Corporal Dan Boyer, head instructor of the firearms unit, was particularly hostile and verbally abusive towards him, often screaming in his ears at the firing range that he was a &#8220;loser,&#8221; a &#8220;coward,&#8221; and &#8220;f  &mdash;  ing useless.&#8221;</p>
<p>On one occasion, Cpl. Boyer (now retired) watched Mr. Tahmourpour sign his name on an evaluation form in the &#8220;Persian&#8221; style of right to left and is alleged to have stated: &#8220;What kind of f  &mdash;  ing language is that, or is it something that you&rsquo;ve made up?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Court of Appeal noted in its ruling this week that the RCMP did not challenge these claims, nor other findings of the Tribunal that racist jokes during sensitivity training were condoned by instructors and that Mr. Tahmourpour&rsquo;s performance evaluations were fabricated and influenced by &#8220;discriminatory attitudes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Tahmourpour&rsquo;s lawyer, Paul Champ, said the case shows the RCMP&rsquo;s tendancy to try to protect its reputation at all costs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most troubling aspect of the case is the way the RCMP fought it for so many years,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The test for an organization is how it responds to these kinds of incidents. The actions of those instructors definitely does not reflect the RCMP as a whole, but what does reflect the RCMP as a whole is how they respond. And they definitely failed on that front.&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked why he is so keen to return to an organization that spent the last 10 years trying to keep him out, Mr. Tahmourpour said he believes it would be unfair to judge the RCMP based on the behaviour of a few individuals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you paint an entire population with the same brush?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m hoping to put my experience to use while serving the RCMP.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite Mr. Tahmourpour&rsquo;s optimism, his battle with the organization to which he wishes to belong may not be over  &mdash;  the RCMP still has the option to take the Court of Appeal&rsquo;s decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.<br/>

		<p>I read Ezra Levant&rsquo;s book &#8216;Shakedown&rsquo;, about how Canadian human rights commissions are destroying our civil liberties, and it provided plenty of detail on just how unsuitable this Muslim gent was re: becoming an RCMP officer. To get through boot camp in a place like the RCMP, you&rsquo;ve got to develop a thick skin. It&rsquo;s part of training people for the job. This Muslim chap would have been an embarrassment, not to mention a liability, for the RCMP, which is why they don&rsquo;t want him back. I hope the RCMP eventually triumphs!</p>

		<p>As a Canadian-born white man, I must admit that I cringe whenever I see a visible-minority person wearing a Mountie uniform, especially a Black man because its so incongruous to the RCMP image. </p>
<p>We also have turban-wearing Mountie Sikhs who&rsquo;ve managed to manipulate the system in their favour and break away from wearing the traditional RCMP headgear.</p>
<p>Anyhow, should Mr. Tahmourpour win re-instatement to the RCMP training depot, and if successful in passing the rigorous program, his proven tenacity skills will serve him well when they deploy him to a 2-man detachment located within the Arctic circle where icy cold winters can last ten months of every year.  </p>

		<p>The article states that he only completed 14 weeks of depot training.</p>
<p>Before he can be badged as a rookie RCMP officer, he must start his training over and successfully do 22 continuous weeks. He may well believe that the RCMP will be afraid to fail him a second time.</p>
<p>His pitbull lawyer is a well-known advocate for Muslims, including one held in Gitmo. I don&rsquo;t see this being over yet.  </p>

		<p>2:  Out of curiosity, I read the phrase &#8220;visible minority&#8221; a lot when AR has Canadian media items, and you just used it.  So it must be a Canadian favored phrase.  So it begs the question:  How did it come into existence?  And why does it even exist?  Is there such a thing as an invisible minority?</p>
<p>Mr. Tahmourpour might be a problem RCMP &#8220;Mountie,&#8221; but I kinda out he&rsquo;s in there as a terrorist mole.  Those types would have played along with the &#8220;insults&#8221; (so-called), and the jewelry ban, and every other &#8220;affront&#8221; that your typical Muslim in an uber-tolerant SWPL white society would have whined about a la this guy.  The real do-badders-in-waiting would have known and adhered to Taqqiya, and would have &#8220;tolerated&#8221; the &#8220;abuse&#8221; and kept their mouths shut in order to get on the inside with as little attention as possible.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the 9/11 hijackers did such seemingly &#8220;un-Islamic&#8221; things as drink, go to strip joints, patronize gyms and their open showers for men, and so on, because their deceit was precisely Islamic and in the spirit of Taqqiya, i.e. lying in order to advance Islam.</p>

		<p>The mounties are a military type organization. It is the duty of the instructors to weed out the misfits and malcontents, just as is done in the us military. This person was obviously not going to conform to their standards, and obviously was trying to make a statement, and has pursued his agenda for ten years. Diversity is the ruination of society. Plus he was yelled at right in his face? Ha ha to anyone who was ever in the military this is an every day occurrence, especially if you are an oddball such as this jerk. The purpose of making a unit is to stamp out individuality,ie everyone looks alike,acts alike and is a part of the unit. The diversity nutcases in the courts should not have say over a military/police body. Oh and that thing about his grandpa, if my grandpa were a rocket scientist would that qualify me to belong to nasa?</p>

		<p>Mr. Tahmourpour should return to Iran, fight to restore the Peacock Throne and join the Royal Persian Mounted Police.  Wouldn&rsquo;t that make more sense?  Last time I looked the Queen of Canada was white and Christian.  These people screw up their own countries and then want to take over our lands.</p>

<p>Yes, I, a middle aged White woman who used to travel almost 52 weeks a year had a guy in a turban checking me through security. It was surreal. </p>

<p>I got news for you, Muslim men do all of those things in Dubai U.A.E. anything and everything goes for them there. The Saudi and Kuwaiti men are especially fond of male/male sex, drinking (see the Kuwait Times any morning for the drunk driving arrests) and of course, WHITE, NON MUSLIM strippers. Muslim men are dispicable hypocrits.</p>

I find your explanation laughable.  Do you really want us to believe that they went to strip joints out of their deep <br/>
religious devotion because Takiya required them to do so? <br/>
 <br/>
It this what you have to do to fit in in America?  Hey, I&rsquo;m an American and I fit in, but I don&rsquo;t go to strip joints.</p>
<p>Obviously, they went boozing and partying because they enjoyed it! Plain and simple.</p>

<p><br/>
&#8220;Visible minority&#8221; or &#8220;vismin&#8221; is indeed an authentic Canadian coinage   &mdash;   one of only two phrases Canada has ever given to the English language (the other is the adding of &#8220;eh?&#8221; to the end of every sentence). </p>
<p>Yes, &#8220;Visible minority&#8221; is a silly phrase, and QD (one of my fave AR posters) is right to wonder how it came about. My guess is that, after Canada&rsquo;s immigration policy was radically changed by the Liberal Party in 1965   &mdash;   a matter of mere months after America&rsquo;s was   &mdash;   the new, nonwhite immigrants who immediately came flooding in were &#8220;visible&#8221; or noticeable in a way that blacks in the US were not. Regardless of whether an American white person likes blacks or not, almost every American grows up seeing lots of them. Pre-1965, Canadians never had. So these &#8220;New Canadians&#8221; (as the Cdn government has euphemistically dubbed them) stood out like a sore thumb. A painful, badly bruised, purplish-brown thumb. A thumb that looks like it&rsquo;s been hit with a hammer. </p>
<p>Flash forward 45 years to today. Now that the white population of Canada&rsquo;s premier city, Toronto, has been reduced to less than 50% (with Montreal and Vancouver not far behind), the Third Worlders are now so numerous that the term &#8220;visible minority&#8221; has been rendered not only meaningless, but misleading. It persists only to keep the country&rsquo;s 14 Federal and Provincial Human Rights Commissions in business. </p>
<p>In fact, as a white Torontonian of &#8220;heritage&#8221; stock   &mdash;   i.e. of European, and specifically British or French, ancestry   &mdash;   it is pale-faced persons like myself who are both visible and a minority. </p>
<p>Not the Human Rights Commissions would see it that way, of course. To them, whites like me are <i>automatically and permanently</i> villains; while the vismins are <i>automatically and permanently</i> victims. </p>

And you could add, I suppose, that you are &#8220;automatically and permanently&#8221; the (wicked and automatically hateful) &#8220;majority&#8221;.</p>
<p>That term will apply, even when you are reduced down to a despised and reviled mere 10%.<br/>

<p>Did they enjoy shaving their faces on a daily basis?  To me, it&rsquo;s a hassle, and Islamic fundamentalism prohibits it.  But the 9/11 hijackers did   &mdash;   They did anything to seem as un-Islamic as possible, to jettison the moral rectitude of fundamentalist Islam, all to adhere to it.</p>

<p>Thank you, Skip!  I have long thought that if God were inclined to help us, he would have done something before now. Apparently, he&rsquo;s disinterested.  As they say, &#8220;God helps those who help themselves.&#8221;  So, He&rsquo;s waiting for us to make the first move.  If we can&rsquo;t be bothered, neither can He.   In other words, it&rsquo;s all up to us.  </p>
