<h1>White House to Impose &#8220;Fairness&#8221; on Education Spending</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Rosenberg, Minding the Campus, July 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>John S. Wilson Jr., executive director of the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, said on Tuesday that the Education Department was looking into which states continue to shortchange public black colleges and how the federal government can make sure appropriations are more equitable among public institutions.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson said the department&rsquo;s Office for Civil Rights was evaluating data on state appropriations to compare amounts given to historically black colleges with those given to traditionally white institutions. The office, he said, is developing strategies to improve any disparities and will announce more details about its plans for action at a September conference held by the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities.</p>
<p>Presumably, according to the White House, in order to be &#8220;fair&#8221; and &#8220;equitable&#8221; there can be no &#8220;disparities&#8221; between the funds states spend on &#8220;historically black&#8221; and &#8220;traditionally white&#8221; institutions.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to observe the enforcement of this new presidential effort at racial engineering. A quick look at a list of HBCU&rsquo;s by state suggests some questions. Alabama, for example, has nine historically black colleges (not all of them public). Does the White House believe that equity and fairness (concepts with which it obviously believes itself to be more knowledgeable than the states) require that each one of them receive the same amount of state funds as each branch of the &#8220;traditionally white&#8221; institutions? That the sum total of funds be equally divided between &#8220;traditionally white&#8221; and &#8220;historically black&#8221; institutions? Or must the spending per student al all public institutions be the same (counting, or not counting, out of state students and in-state illegal immigrants)?</p>
<p>And what, if anything, should be done about states that have no HBCU&rsquo;s, such as Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, or only one, such as California (Charles Drew University of Medicine &amp; Science)? This problem may seem academic (as it were), but it will not seem that way to strong state universities  &mdash;  North Carolina, Virginia, and Texas come to mind  &mdash;  that compete with peers in Michigan, Wisconsin, and California but under the new White House rules would have to reduce, perhaps drastically, the budgets of their flagship institutions. {snip}</p>
<p>And what does the White House propose to do about the Mexicans/Mexican-Americans/ Hispanics? Will the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans require &#8220;fair&#8221; and &#8220;equitable&#8221; spending on Hispanic-serving institutions as well? (And if not, why not?) The Hispanic Association of Colleges &amp; Universities seems to have far more members than there are HBCUs, and they would seem equally to deserve &#8220;fair&#8221; and &#8220;equitable&#8221; treatment. {snip}</p>
<p>Anyone who thought the Obama administration would, finally, allow us to move beyond race must now be having second (or third or fourth) thoughts.</p>

		<p>These HBCU&rsquo;s wouldn&rsquo;t exist without massive federal subsidies as it is.  Many of these colleges are nothing more than a few hundred students and most have atrocious graduation rates.  There was an article on Amren about a black professional&rsquo;s experience at teaching at a HBCU in Alabama.  Needless to say he lasted less than a year if I recall and left depressed by the experience.  </p>

		<p>Typical HBCU story- four black rape suspects arrested for gang rape of one girl, race unknown.  </p>
<p>At least with the mo&rsquo; money flowing from us to Obama to his tribal outpost colleges, maybe they will use some of it in hiring more police officers of any race who will make faster apprehensions of suspects so we won&rsquo;t all be constantly endangered by the &#8220;students&#8221; roaming around in packs with sex on the brain.</p>
<p>Why do black college students succumb so easily to their weakness for gang rape?  Are then not getting their dose of Individualistic Pride from Ayn Rand?</p>
<p>How often do you see stories of White gang rape?  We&rsquo;ve lost our tribal spirit.</p>
<p>Who can concentrate on Atlas Shrugged when they have Fiftycent blaring all the time, even during quiet study hours in the dorm?</p>
<p><br>
Take a look at them.  If they hadn&rsquo;t been at a HBCU, they would have been &#8220;adding needed Diversity&#8221; to your White daughter&rsquo;s incoming freshman class at former &#8220;Historically White College and University&#8221;.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s from &#8220;The Onion.&#8221;  &#8220;Traditionally white institution&#8221; is the touch that gave it away.  There are none.  Many of these &#8220;traditionally white&#8221; colleges are majority non-white, if you add all the non-white races, though Asian is by far the biggest component thereof.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;traditionally white&#8221; colleges discriminate relentlessly against whites.  Nonetheless according to the Obama administration they must not get too much funding relative to colleges that hardly have any whites at all.</p>
<p>In my opinion the <i>only</i> federal funding the universities get should be research grants in the natural sciences.  This would be unacceptable to Obama because then the overwhelming majority of the funds would go to white and Asian scientists, disproportionately male.  The federal government should not be in the business of handing out money for tuition such as Pell grants.  If it didn&rsquo;t then taxes would be that much less and more people would be able to pay for college themselves.  Also, without this subsidy colleges would feel more pressure to contain costs and end the relentless rise in tuition costs.  (Whatever government subsidizes gets more expensive.)</p>

		<p>I think the old sayings ring true here.  &#8220;You can&rsquo;t make a silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear!&#8221;  What is unfair here is allowing blacks to segregate themselves into a separate educational setting and not allowing whites to do the same.  Or Mexicans. Or Native Americans.  I don&rsquo;t believe there should even be any &#8220;black&#8221; colleges today.  Hey - if the blacks want EQUALITY, then let them mingle with everyone else in schools, let them compete on the same level with everyone else without perks, and let them learn how to behave themselves so that they are not a &#8220;clear and present danger&#8221; to other students of all races.  It IS all or nothing as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.  Moreover, no kid who needs remedial anything belongs in a college or university.  Let them go to trade schools and come out able to make an honest and decent living.  Having unqualified material at the college level acts as a damper and drag on students who do qualify, and this is not fair, either.  The U.S. needs to quit subsidizing black colleges and start giving that money to universities which are willing to apply equal standards to everyone.</p>

		<p>How many bright European or Asian college students wish to come to this Great Nation and study at a black college? </p>
<p>How many brain-cancer patients want a neuro-surgeon who attended a black college? </p>
<p>How many of the world&rsquo;s geniuses came out of black colleges?</p>
<p>Black college? What an oxymoron.</p>

		<p>Giving money to any of the &#8220;Historically Black Colleges&#8221; is tantamount to putting cash into a garbage disposal. As unfair as it is in our &#8220;post-racial&#8221; country to even have such institutions the sad fact is that these schools are basically glorified junior highs. They are, in fact, an absolute insult to blacks everywhere.</p>
<p>But blacks are apparently too stupid to even realize the very existence of these fourth-rate schools serve as both insult and testimony to a culture lacking in intelligence. They keep these schools going simply so they can avoid having to meet the standards of white - or traditional - colleges. They clearly get a pass where other schools would not.</p>
<p>These wonderful centers of learning have been unable to even balance their books for as long as I can remember. They have been begging for money year in and year out and they get it - and then it often disappears. These schools are really just another money pit sucking more money out of whites in a twisted welfare scheme where blacks play act as teacher and student and will continue to do so as long as the gravy train keeps rolling.</p>
<p>Let these diploma mills sink or swim on their own. Why are we subsidizing failure?<br>

		<p>Federal bureaucrats and lib congressmen are such hypocrites! &#8220;Black&#8221; colleges with massive PUBLIC suppport 45 yrs after the passage of the alleged race-neutral &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; Act of 1964? Shut em all down. Let the illeterate &#8220;students&#8221; at these phony facades for academia relearn how to pick crops, shoot guns for the miltary or wait tables with offending customers. Or to save the taxpayer real bucks, give each student and &#8220;professor&#8221; at these comical campuses fifty grand in cash and a plane ticket back to Senegal or Cameroon. They will be part of the elite there. I&rsquo;m no bigot bruthas; I&rsquo;d cut off fed aid to Yeshiva U and all Catholic, Mormon and evangelical colleges too. You believe in God? He&rsquo;ll provide. But at least Notre Dame and Yeshiva have standards. Howard?  Ha Ha.</p>

If they allocate money for HBCs, it should be considered affirmative action.</p>
<p>These HBCs should also be recruiting blacks instead of letting traditionally non-HBCs take this valuable resource.</p>
<p>If it means more blacks choosing to go to HBCs and ending their claims to a right to attend non-HBCs, I say give them the money.</p>
