<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=175729">Investigation of &#8216;Anti-White Bias&rsquo; Grows</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Fitzpatrick, WorldNetDaily, July 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights today suggested it is expanding its review of claims that the Department of Justice has implemented a ban on prosecuting defendants who are black.</p>
<p>The comments came at a hearing in Washington at which commission members asked witness J. Christian Adams to provide the names of other Department of Justice attorneys who might shed further light on his allegation that the DOJ is afflicted by a &#8220;culture of hostility&#8221; toward prosecuting black perpetrators of voting rights violations against white victims.</p>
<p>Commissioner Gail Heriot asked Adams to provide a &#8220;list of attorneys in the department who could corroborate&#8221; his testimony, indicating that the commission plans to expand its investigation of racial bias in the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Also, Adams revealed that some DOJ staffers were disciplined for harassing other departmental attorneys because they held &#8220;evangelical religious views&#8221; and worked on a case brought against a black political activist in Mississippi.</p>
<p>Adams, until recently a top trial attorney in the voting section of the DOJ, testified that staffers throughout the department have subscribed for years to the notion that the DOJ&rsquo;s primary responsibility is to protect the voting rights of minority voters, not whites.</p>
<p>He added that recent Obama administration DOJ appointees have reinforced this notion by making such racial discrimination a formal departmental policy.</p>
<p>According to the former DOJ attorney, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Julie Fernandez, an Obama appointee at the top of the department, announced at a policy meeting that &#8220;the voting section will not bring any other cases against blacks and other minorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Adams testified that Fernandez also said the department &#8220;has no interest in enforcing&#8221; the section of the Motor Voter law that requires local jurisdictions to purge the voting rolls of ineligible voters, even deceased voters, because &#8220;it has nothing to do with increasing turnout.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commissioner Peter Kirsanow asked Adams &#8220;to what extent&#8221; the department believes equal treatment before the law applies to all voters.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s the problem,&#8221; replied Adams. &#8220;They assume Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act doesn&rsquo;t apply to white voters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams pointed out that over the past 45 years, the department has brought hundreds of cases against whites violating the rights of ethnic minority voters, but only two cases against blacks violating the rights of whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Adams said the DOJ&rsquo;s attitude toward racial neutrality will be demonstrated in mid-July when the department has to choose a course of action in the next phase of a case against black political leader Ike Brown of Knox City, Miss. &#8220;If they don&rsquo;t object to the submission, they will be [saying] that section 5 does not apply to white victims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams resigned from the department after he was ordered by his superiors to drop a case prosecutors already had won  &mdash;  the notorious New Black Panther Party intimidation of voters in a majority black precinct in urban Philadelphia on Election Day in 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Adams alleged that many DOJ employees, both career civil servants and political appointees, have told him that the DOJ &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t have the resources&#8221; to enforce the voting rights laws in a &#8220;race-neutral&#8221; manner by bringing cases against members of minority groups who violate the law. Others have refused to work on either of the two cases against black perpetrators, saying, &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t join the voting rights division to sue black people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams said one DOJ staffer told his former superior, Christopher Coates, then the chief of the DOJ&rsquo;s Voting Section, &#8220;Can you believe we&rsquo;re being sent down to Mississippi to defend white people?&#8221; He reported another staffer told Coates, &#8220;the Brown case has gotten us into so much trouble with civil rights groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Adams, some members of the DOJ Voting Section staff were &#8220;harassed&#8221; by other members &#8220;for working on the Brown case.&#8221; An internal department investigation led to sanctions against some staffers for &#8220;badgering&#8221; others because they worked on the Brown case and held &#8220;evangelical religious views.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Adams, Coates suffered humiliation and the gradual loss of his power because he supported the case against the New Black Panther Party. Adams repeatedly urged the members of the commission to bring Coates in to testify about the department&rsquo;s hostility toward bringing cases against minority members.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;As I walked up, they closed ranks, next to each other,&#8221; the witness [in the New Black Panther Party case] told Fox News at the time. &#8220;So I walked directly in between them, went inside and found the poll watchers. They said they&rsquo;d been here for about an hour. And they told us not to come outside because a black man is going to win this election no matter what.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the man with a nightstick told him, &#8220;&#8216;We&rsquo;re tired of white supremacy,&rsquo; and he starts tapping the nightstick in his hand. At which point I said, &#8216;OK, we&rsquo;re not going to get in a fistfight right here,&rsquo; and I called the police.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;He added that recent Obama administration DOJ appointees have reinforced this notion by making such racial discrimination a formal departmental policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a big surprise this is!</p>
<p>The &ldquo;post racial&rdquo; president is appointing racially radical nonwhites and Communist traitors to the DOJ, who would have ever guessed?</p>
<p>Interestingly, this story seems to have begun to have a life of its own and is not going away. I recently even caught something on MSNBC about this, biased though it was, it still hit the main points. Why, who knows? Two possibilities do come to mind however:</p>
<p>1.) This administration was put into power way ahead of its time and because it &ldquo;reflects what America should look like,&rdquo; is precociously failing at exponential rates on the race issue;</p>
<p>2.) The powers that be, might be having second thoughts about our multicultural utopia or at least want to gauge current white discontent with it.</p>
<p>Either way, it is clear that contrary to the multicultural mythology, we are on the brink of some real changes in this country, that Comrade BO and his hopelessly mystified followers never dreamed could happen!</p>

		<p>Glenn Beck did a good job tonight tying the New Black Panthers to Obama through &#8220;gimme mo slavery reparations&#8221; Prof. Ogletree.</p>
<p>Then he went off the rails as usual when talking about the evil Whites in the South who wanted to return their government to White Rule through &#8220;militant intimidation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sometimes I don&rsquo;t think Beck listens to himself.  Our problems are the blacks who vote and elect blacks to rule over us and make our lives miserable and steal from us our life, liberty, property and pursuit of happiness and God given White Privilege.</p>
<p>With his insights, he should be praising the Knights of the White Camelia, etc, instead of damning those great heroes of our White Humanity.</p>
<p>He never once while discussing Reconstruction described the unconstitutional Reconstruction Acts that drove the Whites into the self defense patrols.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s never read The Tragic Era by Bowers or Sequel to Appomattox by Fleming.  If he had, he would be sympathetic to his White brothers in the South.</p>

		<p>Middle Class Whites will be less willing to endure Diversity Is Our Strength mandates while we all are discussing this <br>
&#8220;It&rsquo;s okay now to hate whitey&#8221; story at work. That&rsquo;s why we are headed toward total government control and censorship of the MSM and Internet.  The hidden powers just can&rsquo;t afford to have White Humanity  openly discussing our targeted status and loss of civil liberties and equal protection under the law.  They must shut down communication so that we will never find out that others think like us and offer support.</p>
<p>The greatest threat and enemy to the hidden powers: White Unity.</p>
<p>They must keep us divided and fighting.  White Unity is what they hate most, and they know that the Anglo-Saxon-Celtic-Germanic love of liberty only needs a band of brothers to come together in unity and then the trouble starts.  White Unity must be destroyed.</p>
<p>(Shame on FoxNews: not once during coverage of this story did they observe that Whites no longer have equal protection under the law.)<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t quite get the point of this voter intimidation business. Unless they&rsquo;re actually coming into the polling booth and watching you, you could just say, &#8220;YAAAHHH BOSS! I&rsquo;m votin&rsquo; fer da Messiah, alright!&#8221; then vote for whomever you please.</p>
<p>Since we&rsquo;re stuck with da Messiah now though, I must confess to having zero respect for Eric Holder. We&rsquo;ve had some dumb attorney generals of late, but I think this guy&rsquo;s actually got psychological problems. He&rsquo;s not quite white, so he&rsquo;s gotta act ultra anti-white to compensate. Just another mediocre black with affirmative action qualifications, dubbed brilliant because he can complete a sentence without adding &#8220;Yuh-know-wuddum-sayin&rsquo;?&#8221;</p>

		<p>#4, I certainly agree with what you say about Holder.  And I think that sometimes people of his complexion resent that they are not wholly white and secretly resent the extreme label of &#8220;black&#8221;.  Of course, the label was thrust upon America by radicals of his own ethnicity who wanted to totally own being of African origin.  The word &#8220;black&#8221; was used derogatorily by the &#8220;colored&#8221; people of the time to designate a very dark-skinned person.  Now we are expected to label as black folks who don&rsquo;t even look to have 1/32 of African ancestry.<br>
As for the fact that intimidated whites could vote anyway they wanted by pretending to support Obama: I think most of them who were threatened by billy-club wielding black thugs figured they would never make it past them.  I seem to recall one of the thugs shouting that the poll was for blacks only  &mdash;  or maybe I just got the impression that&rsquo;s what he meant.  No doubt it was.</p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>This is where I think there has to be some basis of bias-in-turn from a &#8216;bitter quitter&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If Mr. Adams had stayed in office, recorded what was said and blown the whistle while he was still in a position to both know the latest offenses against his department (who said/memo&rsquo;d/threatened what) and potentially suffer for his heroics, this whole prosecution would be in a LOT better position to dictate consequences based on evidentiary proof rather than &#8216;other witnesses&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know what kind of anti-surveillance electronics the DOJ has within it&rsquo;s walls.  I assume they are least -externally- secure.  But whatever it took, it would have been better to have something concrete than be stuck in he said/she said mode.</p>
<p>Which is where this will be brought to, in a hurry, if there is -anything- behind the &#8216;consulted the White House&rsquo; rumours on the case dropping decision.</p>

<p>Very true. Not in this century anyway. So that tells us that blacks are not the ones who have been in control of this.  Think about it!</p>

<p>Yes indeed, it must be an extremely galling thing to him.  But remember that his family comes from Barbados.  And on that island, upper class mulattos of his complexion are considered &#8220;white&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Late breaking news on this front:</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/3x4bzl3</p>
<p>Relevant paragraphs:</p>
<p>&#8220;She said she would not support any enforcement of a key section of the federal &#8216;Motor Voter&rsquo; law   &mdash;   Section 8, which requires states to periodically purge their voter rolls of dead people, felons, illegal voters and those who have moved out of state.  According to Mr. Adams, Justice lawyers were told by Ms. Fernandes: &#8216;We&rsquo;re not interested in those kind of cases. What do they have to do with helping increase minority access and turnout? We want to increase access to the ballot, not limit it.&rsquo;&#8221;  So we&rsquo;re not interested in purging voter registration roles of dead people, felons, illegal voters, and people who moved out of state.  We want to keep them on the rolls because we want to increase access.</p>
<p>What that means is they want to increase voter fraud.  All that matters is that the people are registered, not if they actually vote.  Corrupt black poll workers will vote them after hours.  That&rsquo;s why black poll boxes take a very long time to get to the central canvassing board, because they&rsquo;re holding them back to see how many votes they need to fake up in order to put the machine-favored black over the top.</p>
<p>So he was also told in addition to dropping the New Black Panther case to forget about Section 8 of Motor Voter, by the Obama Justice Department.  Now, J. Christian Adams is also saying now that the real reason the New Black Panthers were at the polling site in Philadelphia doing the intimidating was to extract the poll watchers so that ACORN voters could vote without being challenged.  This is the line attorney who quit after he was told to drop the case. He said that the intimidation was just a diversion tactic. It was to keep the poll watchers&rsquo; attention diverted to possible violence while ACORN voters snuck in there and voted perhaps illegally or what have you.  </p>
<p>Nothing to add.  I wonder if the precincts in Philly where all this NBPP stuff went down are heavily black or mixed or mostly white.</p>

<p>Then feel free to move to Liberia or somewhere else in Africa where you can be around blacks and there are no whites to hold you back.  Problem solved.</p>

<p>The baton-wielding incident occurred at 12th and Fairmount. The zip code is about two-thirds black. Supposedly the precinct in question voted something like 596 to 13 in favor of Obama.</p>
