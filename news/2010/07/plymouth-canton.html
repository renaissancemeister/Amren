<h1>Plymouth-Canton Minority-Teacher Push Stirs Controversy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shawn D. Lewis, Detroit News, July 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A recent directive in the Plymouth-Canton Community Schools urges administrators to scan resumes for &#8220;cues&#8221; that applicants are from a minority racial group. Tip-offs can include job-seekers&rsquo; residence, college attendance, fraternity or church membership and employment history.</p>
<p>Nearly a quarter of Plymouth-Canton&rsquo;s nearly 19,000 students are minorities, compared with less than 3 percent of its educational staff. District officials say they want to close that gap while hiring the most-qualified candidates.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re a good district, but this will help us look closer at ourselves,&#8221; said Superintendent Craig Fiegel. &#8220;We know we&rsquo;ve needed to do it, but we&rsquo;re now making a conscious effort to change .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and are talking about being more diverse in areas where we haven&rsquo;t been diverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They should hire the most qualified teachers, and race and gender should not be a factor,&#8221; said Gratz, director of the American Civil Rights Institute, a California-based group that advocates against affirmative action.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s insulting, says parent Ann Marie Hudak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who says minority teachers can&rsquo;t be qualified?&#8221; asks Hudak, chairwoman of the Plymouth-Canton Citizens for Diversity and Inclusion. &#8220;Our teaching population should reflect the student population, because, based on statistics, kids who see themselves reflected in teachers tend to score higher on tests, and it&rsquo;s important for our children.&#8221;</p>
<p>In districts across Metro Detroit, the percentage of minority students far exceeds the percentage of minority teachers and administrators. Statewide, minorities comprise 17 percent of administrators and 10 percent of teachers, while minorities account for 30 percent of all students.</p>
<p>For instance, more than 40 percent of students in the West Bloomfield Public Schools district are minorities, while less than 10 percent of teachers and administrators are nonwhite. In the Warren Consolidated Schools, more than one in five students is a minority, compared with less than 2 percent of the staff.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kerry Birmingham, media relations specialist for the Michigan Education Association in Lansing, said it supports the push by Plymouth-Canton.</p>

		<p>The directive violates the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative.  Of course, the directive is an end run around the fact that the district can&rsquo;t engage in out and outright affirmative action, thanks to MCRI.</p>

<p>I have not seen any such statistics.  If this were true, then why isn&rsquo;t the Detroit Public Schools the envy of the world?<br>

<p>I agree completely. The Detroit school system and Board Of Education is a sterling example of this notion.</p>

		<p>Blacks do not want to become teachers because it is too demanding, the salary is too low,and they might be subject to the kind of abuse that they gave out to the teachers that they had.I knew a black (female)who chucked a career in teaching for a job with a railroad for those reasons. </p>

<p> They can either close the gap by hiring blacks, or they can hire the most qualified -  they can&rsquo;t do both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They should hire the most qualified teachers, and race and gender should not be a factor,&rdquo; </p>
<p> That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve BEEN doing, that&rsquo;s WHY minorities make up  less than 3 percent of its educational staff. And I imagine 3% is more than it should be.<br>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t possible to hire the most competent candidates if the requirement exists that blacks have to represent a greater percentage.  Experience has verified that time after time, yet, for some reason, these people just can&rsquo;t get it through their heads that black teachers have been tested extensively in some areas, and they can&rsquo;t pass the teacher&rsquo;s exam.  In more than one instance, black and other non-white teachers given student tests couldn&rsquo;t pass those either.</p>
<p>White parents should do everything in their power to move out of districts with large non-white populations or try very hard to come up with a plan for home-schooling.</p>

<p>Another liar.  There are no statistics that prove that.  Every time a leftist opens their mouth it&rsquo;s just lies upon lies.  It  sounds like she is inadvertently advocating for segregated schools, which would be beneficial to white students.    </p>

Really, what do they want?</p>
<p>If we go, all white teachers are gone. And they should be ashamed of that, leaving blacks and problems back behind. If we don&rsquo;t go it is our fault also. <br>
If we make so much trouble leave us alone! </p>

		<p>Gee, imagine that; blacks who can make it through the &#8220;school of education&#8221; don&rsquo;t want to teach their own. When I was in high school, there were some older black teachers who started off in the segregated school system. They were qualified for that school system, but tended to be out of their league compared to the white teachers. We had a black principal and assistant principal, so they were not going to lose their jobs unless they committed murder, arson, grand theft auto, or some other really stupid act. </p>
<p>How many of the 68% of teachers in the Detroit system know that they would be out the door in no time of they moved to another district? But then Detroit has been on life support forever. </p>
<p>Some years ago, I was in a grocery store at an early hour to pick up a couple of items and struck up a conversation with the bread deliveryman. He was working on his teaching degree and when it came time for student teaching, he was sent to an almost all black rural district. The student teaching lasted one semester and he got the delivery job through a friend of a friend. He made better money and had less stress moving bread. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll admit that I graduated from high school thirty years ago and perhaps I&rsquo;m a little out of touch with today&rsquo;s youth, but I don&rsquo;t ever remember looking at my teachers as either black or white, young or old, male or female (okay, except maybe for that cute ninth-grade biology teacher that had all the girls drooling); to me they were just TEACHERS.  They taught, I learned, end of story.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that - gasp! - RACIAL PROFILING!? </p>
<p>No amount of appealing to &#8220;fairness&#8221; or pointing out hypocrisy will do any good, except in the case of attempting to de-program hypnotized &amp; brainwashed whites.  </p>
<p>Every such apparent &#8220;double standard&#8221; is simply the truth showing, and the truth is this: those &#8220;standards&#8221; that shift are not standards at all.   All that verbal rope-a-dope is nothing but a smokescreen for the real standard;  the very simple, singular drive: get rid of the whites.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we hear so little about the &#8220;race problem&#8221; and &#8220;lack of diversity&#8221; in Detroit public schools and Detroit as a whole.  As far as they are concerned, it&rsquo;s mission accomplished in Detroit.   </p>

		<p>Always excuses.  Let them &#8220;normalize&#8221; the teaching staff to reflect the color of the student population.  It will not improve anything, and the results will be there to substantiate it.  Unless of course other factors holding back the race are then discovered.  <br>
These kids have but one chance to be educated, no matter how small.  Shame on the Board of Ed for such antics to cover their own inadequacies at the expense of a generation of kids, many who are severally limited.  <br>
Role models can and should be any color.  Education should start with foundations of behavioral issues, including personal responsibility others, what you owe society, anger control, critical thinking.  Some might call that white stuff.</p>

<p>If only a small number of blacks enter teacher&rsquo;s college   &mdash;   and only an even smaller number graduate   &mdash;   then where are these minority teachers &#8220;who look like the students and who the students can relate to, etc&#8221; supposed to come from? These people simply don&rsquo;t exist   &mdash;   at least not in the quantities &#8220;required&#8221; by the Diversicrats. </p>
<p>Any School Board can only hire from among available applicants. If there aren&rsquo;t enough qualified candidates from the &#8220;correct&#8221; minorities, what exactly is the Board supposed to do? Cook some up in the lab? </p>

		<p>The answers are both obvious and occulted.</p>
<p>1.  The term &#8216;role model&rsquo; may well be synonymous with &#8216;parental figure&rsquo; as so many minorities don&rsquo;t have a reliable one.</p>
<p>2.  When someone says &#8216;empathy&rsquo; or &#8216;cultural perspective&rsquo; what they are really saying is that blacks don&rsquo;t take bleep from blacks and they well know that the attitude just bounces off.  Imagine the response of a young buck who&rsquo;s never had a mature male of his own race not be impressed by his antics.  At All.</p>
<p>3.  When you are talking about minority hiring, you are talking &#8216;enablement industries&rsquo; and indeed, in places like Nashville where they have gone from a 13 percent to a 35 percent minority hiring practice in a single year, &#8216;who you know&rsquo; is probably very important to how well you do.  Requiring an entirely new screening and recruitment staff who are, gasp, probably minorities themselves.  Follow the money honey.</p>

<p>*** By this theory, then white children should learn from white teachers, asians from asian teachers, etc.  </p>

<p>*** This is where it gets really stupid.  Most teachers have been teaching for 10 years.  10 to 15 years ago, this area had few minorities.  I know because this was one of my old haunts.  If the blacks and latinos, who are flooding out of the ghetto in all directions wash over Canton, the same old teachers will still be there, even if the student demogrpahics change rapidly. </p>
<p>It will take time for the older white teachers to move or retire, then blacks and latinos can claim another slice of America for themselves.</p>

<p>No one said minority teachers can&rsquo;t be qualified, Ms. Hudak.  The only statement was that the best available teachers should be hired, irrespective of their racial or ethnic background or genitalia configuration.  The only person intimating a lack of ability of minority teaches is YOU, Ms. Hudak.  </p>
<p><b>You should stick to the facts and stop trying to change the focus of the discussion via race-baiting.</b></p>
