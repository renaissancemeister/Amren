			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KGO-TV (San Francisco), July 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Department of Justice will conduct an independent review of the Johannes Mehserle case in order to determine whether or not the shooting merits federal prosecution, according the department.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Justice Department has been closely monitoring the state&rsquo;s investigation and prosecution,&#8221; the department said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Civil Rights Division, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office, and the FBI have an open investigation into the fatal shooting and, at the conclusion of the state&rsquo;s prosecution, will conduct an independent review of the facts and circumstances to determine whether the evidence warrants federal prosecution.&#8221;</p>

We approve.</p>
<p>Anything the black-mulatto-White elite coalition can do to show White America that racial politics and ethnocentric loyalty is normal, acceptable, and to be expected, we need.</p>
<p>Anything that gives FoxNews another race story that shows our White Humanity what has been done to their White Republic and how they are racially profiled for dispossession and degradation, we need, and need lots more of it in a hurry.</p>
<p>Worse is better.  Please, Eric Holder, be yourself, be black (or as black as possible given the White genes you stole from a White woman&rsquo;s womb) and be proud, and most of all, dedicate yourself to making Whites as miserable as possible.  We need somebody louder than us to shout that message to our White Cousins who refuse to wake up- so far.<br>

		<p>This was easy to predict once the verdict came back that Mehserle was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. The Feds will subvert 200 years of US law by inflicting double-jeopardy on the defendant. </p>

		<p>This will go down [can I use that phrase - - &#8220;go down&#8221;?] like what has happened with those boys in Pennsylvania. Attacked twice by the Mexican illegal alien, they fought back and by accident the Mexican was killed. Boys were found guilty of charges LESS than murder so then the feds moved in and now are going to try the same boys under federal charges for civil rights violations and such. Conviction resulting in a much stiffer prison sentence.</p>
<p>This Johannes is going to face another trial [??], this time by the feds, the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; advocates trying for a conviction that will result in more jail time.</p>
<p>THIS WOULD ONLY HAPPEN TO A WHITE PERSON!!</p>

		<p>This is pure nonsense.  White-black issues in this country has reached an absurdity level.  Whites are punishing themselves for imaginary wrongs committed against blacks.  Slavery was appropriate during those past times.  A nation should not hold itself hostage to appropriate acts that were committed long ago by other human beings.  Blacks have been paid thousands times over by this country for some delusional wrongs.  This country cannot keep giving when it has not been earned.   </p>
<p>This country is regressing in education, ethnics, morality, technology/science, arts under the burden of this self punishing guilt.</p>
<p>This oscar grant was a representative of the majority of the blacks on this planet.  The only problem here was that a white man shot a black man, a trouble maker at that.  Blacks have these delusional ideas of where they stand with the rest of society.  Currently, it is more of a white and black issue.  In the future, it will be interesting how the Chinese will deal with them.  The Japanese avoid black interactions, while the Chinese are dealing with them head on even allowing them to be in China.   </p>

		<p> Obama&rsquo;s Justice Department seems to specialize in ignoring the things that need to be investigated and/or prosecuted, seeking to file charges in the cases that are best left alone, and being totally clueless as to its own political dyslexia. One is tempted to yell, &#8220;Where the heck did they get these incompetent jerks?!&#8221; Except that, we know where he got them   &mdash;   South Side Chicago, Harvard law school, and anywhere else from whence leftists come.</p>
<p> As to the particular case which caused all the rioting in Oakland, think about it this way: Either the policeman, presumably well aware of the colossal mess a deliberate unprovoked shooting would land him in, went ahead and did it on purpose anyway; or, as he testified on the stand, he made a tragic mistake in grabbing his service sidearm instead of his Taser gun. I rather believe the second scenario is the true one. The blacks in Oakland, as blacks in all the big cities, love an opportunity to be &#8220;outraged&#8221; and riot (and loot, and burn) in the streets.</p>

		<p>Where were they when OJ Simpson got away with a brutal double murder of two White people? Where was the outrage over that obvious miscarriage of justice? Everyone outside of the jury room saw the evidence that Judge Ito refuse to allow into the trial. The fact is that Whites are now considered less equal than other races in their own country.</p>

		<p>In this instance, I agree that the case should be reviewed. I&rsquo;m against police brutality. Videos of what happened were shown round the world. The guy was already face down and not resisting. The cop shot him in cold blood. The officer says he mistook his taser for a gun. If the guy was already incapacitated, why even taser him? So, in any case, this was police brutality.<br>
 <br>
We readers here on AmRen can not have the knee-jerk reaction that White is always right, because that would make us just as bad as the black racists who think Black is always right. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what went on in the courtroom, but in this case, it&rsquo;s possible that the cops lied for each other, and justice was not fairly served. Unjustifiably brutal police officers of any race need to go to jail.</p>

		<p>I find something disturbing about the first comment.  Worse is not better, worse is worse.  That should be inherently obvious.  Worse for whites is only better for those who are working against whites. </p>
<p>How many white people are you willing to see sacrificed in the vain hope that the injustice of it will awaken whites to the war being waged upon them?  </p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t there been enough- or rather: haven&rsquo;t there been far too many white victims already?  Not only do we need no more white victims to prove the point, but must not tolerate a single victim more. </p>
<p>Until it is proven, and repeatedly confirmed that making victims of whites will not be tolerated (things like this incident prove the opposite ) and the penalty to paid for it too terrible to dare risking it, the genocide of whites will proceed.  Most likely at an increasing pace.   </p>
<p>Consider it from the other side : what recent injustices against non-whites are there that could account for the great unity and motivation of the anti-whites?  A rhetorical question.  There are none.  None that can account for what&rsquo;s going on.  </p>
<p>Only a concerted and continuing propaganda effort on a very large scale can account for the high level of hostility towards whites that is now so prevalent around the world.  </p>
<p>We keep hearing a distorted and largely fabricated history of white evil, while the enormous blessings that have flowed from white nations to the whole world are discounted or denied altogether.  No continuing injustices are necessary to fan the flames of hatred for whites- only the continuing tale of them, whether true or not. </p>
<p>Do not gloat over white victims.  The enemy does that.  If you are white, you should mourn for your kin, and be enraged.  Do not think that the enemy will pass you over if you will sacrifice your kin.  The only thing that can save you is solidarity.  If you are not fully committed to the defense of whites, you are a weak link.  </p>

		<p>It almost sounds like we are becoming a single nation with two sets of laws. One based on the constitution and the other on &#8220;civil rights&#8221;. What&rsquo;s going to happen when these two are in conflict with each other? Are all cases going to to be tried twice to cover both laws? </p>

		<p>The law governing violation of civil rights is now as outdated as municipal ordinances proscribing panties hanging on a clothesline.  It may have been useful for a few cases in the Deep South half a century ago, but it&rsquo;s totally unnecessary and starkly redundant today.  Despite the bugaboo laments concerning &#8220;racist cops&#8221; and &#8220;all-white juries&#8221;, blacks are not presently being unfairly arrested, prosecuted, convicted, or handed undue sentences.  Blacks are not prohibited from jury duty and face the same scrutiny as any other ethnicity in being impaneled.  You can check Google and actually find references to an all white jury in the Mehserle case  &mdash;  yet the jury was NOT all-white!  It apparently had no blacks, but contained 3 Hispanics and an Asian.  In CA, blacks are even a smaller minority than in the rest of the nation, so it would never be a surprise that none were seated.<br>
Yet, no liberal white pundit would dare to suggest that we no longer need violation-of-civil-rights prosecutions, now would they?</p>

<p>It may be even worse. Fox News reported that the Feds may also investigate the other officers who were with Mehserle.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why any White man would want to go into law enforcement these days. One wrong encounter with a diversity and your life is over.   <br>

		<p>Once again I can&rsquo;t support any side in this story. I don&rsquo;t have any sympathy for the cop or the &#8220;victim&#8221; or the rioters or the Justice Department. From the videos I&rsquo;ve seen, it looks like the cop shot an unarmed black thug in cold blood after he was spread-eagled on the ground, but the thug was no great loss and the blacks staging these riots are a relatively small group of Marxist types and recycled Black Panther idiots who think the best way to protest a police shooting is to break their neighbor&rsquo;s windows. If they weren&rsquo;t rioting about this, they&rsquo;d be rioting about something else. As for Holder, we all know the Obama Nation is corrupt. They&rsquo;ll charge the cop with violating the black thug&rsquo;s civil rights and keep trying him until they get the verdict they want. That&rsquo;s just the way it is in our glorious multicultural paradise.</p>

		<p>Of course, don&rsquo;t wait for any review of the Back Panthers threatening Whites in Philadelphia, PA. IT will never happen, as most of us enlightened readers already know.</p>
<p>There was no such investigation regarding the Race murders of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsome, 14 year old Christopher Jones, in a Baltimore, MD suburb, or of the &#8220;Wichita Five&#8221; who were all tortured, and murdered, by sadistic Blacks. </p>
<p>No. No &#8220;Justice&#8221; Department investigation for any of these atrocities, or any related saturation Media coverage, coast to coast, either.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think this cop deserves any sympathy.  I saw the video of this event shortly after it happened and the shooting is completely unwarranted.  He deserves to be thrown to the wolves.  The badge and gun makes a lot of these folks start thinking they&rsquo;re a cut above the rest of us.  </p>
<p>Police in America have too much power and not enough accountability when they misuse it.  They don&rsquo;t exist to &#8220;serve and protect.&#8221;  The police exist to preserve the government monopoly on force.  They&rsquo;re a legal gang.  Bloods and crips with badges.  </p>
<p>I understand the indignation over the federal prosecutions but we can&rsquo;t do anything about that.  If we did, our own white police would oppose us with force.  They&rsquo;re not on our side, that much is obvious.  If the big government goes away, so does the high pay and pension benefits.    </p>
<p>Someone said &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know why any White man would go into law enforcement these days.&#8221;  Well, because it&rsquo;s a hell of a good paying job, especially if you just got done with a stint in the military killing people overseas and need a career that allows you to channel your narrow skill set and rewards your mindless acceptance of and adherence to authority.    </p>
<p>I used to be a big police apologist until I had a few run-ins with them in a short period of time and on one occasion my right to be secure in my person was violated without cause.  If I had a dollar for every time I heard a cop say &#8220;we can&rsquo;t do anything about it&#8221; I&rsquo;d be a rich man.  </p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t take the defense of your home into your own hands.  They don&rsquo;t like that and around here if you do so they&rsquo;ll wait around for you to leave home and check you for weapons on the street with no probable cause.</p>
<p>Our government is beginning to unravel, and when it does, our police with no skills other than using lethal force and extracting money from the populace on behalf of the government, they&rsquo;re still going to need to eat.  And they&rsquo;re going to do what they do best.  Shake downs.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an illusion that our police and military will stand up for us against an oppressive government.  Most of them are more likely to continue to serve their master.  If and when the order comes down to confiscate gold, guns, or what have you, that&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s going to be on your doorstep.  And they won&rsquo;t be coming with flowers in the barrels of their rifles.  </p>

<p>Absolutely correct.  This &#8220;serve and protect&#8221; thing has always been a myth and the courts have ruled repeatedly that the police have no duty to protect us. They like to present themselves as &#8220;peace officers&#8221; and so on, but they aren&rsquo;t there to preserve the peace or protect the citizens. Their job is to enforce the law, i.e., to  use PHYSICAL FORCE to impose the will of our corrupt politicians on the population. That&rsquo;s why they are called law ENFORCEMENT. And the problem is only getting worse now that local police forces are being militarized and federalized. If the Obama Gang starts to go after American Renaissance readers, for instance, never forget that it will be the police kicking down your doors in the middle of the night. The State&rsquo;s &#8220;authority&#8221; is based on physical force. That&rsquo;s the way the system works. Max Weber was right when he defined the State as &#8220;the monopoly on legitimate violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our government is beginning to unravel, and when it does, our police with no skills other than using lethal force and extracting money from the populace on behalf of the government, they&rsquo;re still going to need to eat. And they&rsquo;re going to do what they do best. Shake downs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Correct again. The country is collapsing and there&rsquo;s a good argument to be made that it&rsquo;s already collapsed. Whatever the case, our militarized police forces will end up working for one faction or another and you&rsquo;re right that they&rsquo;ll turn to shakedowns. The police have always been involved in shakedowns to one degree or another. In fact, the entire system from taxes to traffic tickets is nothing but a shakedown, a kind of &#8220;normalized&#8221; protection racket. It&rsquo;s really no different from the traditional Mafia protection rackets, only this one is &#8220;legal,&#8221; meaning that the faction that currently holds the monopoly on legitimate violence in this country has declared that it is legal and legitimate. Pay your taxes or we&rsquo;ll confiscate your property and put you in jail. What is &#8220;bail&#8221; if it isn&rsquo;t paying a ransom to gain your freedom? The &#8220;law&#8221; is a very ancient form of social control and the power to make the law is always gained through war and violence.  Political theory and intellectual arguments have very little to do with anything. They&rsquo;re academic preoccupations. The &#8220;law&#8221; is violence and the line separating US police forces from, say, the police in Mexico, is getting thinner every day.</p>

		<p>15, 16:</p>
<p>Are you correct in saying that cops are doing a job a nothing more?  Yes   &mdash;   Anti-Deseg protesters found that out in Boston in the 1970s, and found it out the hard way:  The very same white Boston cops that were their friends in the bars and taverns the evening before agreeing with them about how bad deseg was was ready to arrest them the next morning when the formal street theater happened.</p>
<p>However, where I part ways from both of you is that I can never engage in the same kind of gratuitous swipes that you do   &mdash;   I had the opportunity to use the St. Louis City Dep&rsquo;t firearms simulator about ten years ago.  The main lesson I took away from it is that being a cop can be really difficult, especially in (ahem) big cities.  I also learned that I&rsquo;d be the world&rsquo;s worst cop, and that if I&rsquo;m in an altercation with a cop, to make life as easy as possible for the cop.</p>
<p>Apply this to Oscar Grant   &mdash;   I just can&rsquo;t believe he was completely laid out on the ground, legs and arms spread eagle.  He had to have done something to make Johannes Mesherle fearful, such that he mistakenly reached for his real gun instead of his taser.  Just what was that?</p>
<p>As an aside, I know there are at least a half dozen professions more physically dangerous and risky than being a cop (including urban public school teacher), but it&rsquo;s not a fair comparison   &mdash;   All those other professions don&rsquo;t give those doing the profession a badge and a gun indicative of, was 16 says that Weber said, a legitimate monopoly on the use of force on behalf of some level of government.  The key word there is &#8220;force,&#8221; especially armed force.</p>

<p>You are correct in stating the police/government/military will not protect you and, in fact, if you are White, will target you for attack.

<p>&#8220;&hellip;If and when the order comes down to confiscate gold, guns, or what have you, that&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s going to be on your doorstep&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Undoubtedly so.  Stash your tangible assets and arms well  &mdash;   there are new floor safes available that are undetectable by metal detectors, companies that sell what look like old dusty books like &#8216;Silas Marner&rsquo; that no one would touch, hollowed out where you can put valuables, and new non-detectable PVC-type tubes for burying gold and sliver near your concrete foundation or under your pit bull&rsquo;s dog house.</p>
<p>But, most importantly, keep your mouth shut at all times about any weapons, precious metals, or stores of food or water you may have.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>15 &amp; 16 are right on ! We live in Oakland in a mixed area and it has been 13 years of living hell. The Oakland Police could care less, they have all been brainwashed with Communist sensitivity training and they respond super quickly to crank complaints from blacks while we have waited hours on genuine complaints. They always say that they can&rsquo;t do anything no matter what the level of harassment by blacks is. Recently a black tenant moved into a previously all Asian building next door to our house and she has been a tenant from hell. The Chinese landlords could care less, we hope eventually that she sticks them but good. This BART officer was no good. But considering the level of black on black violence alone, not to mention the level of black violence against everyone else, the uproar is totally hypocritical. Oakland is worse than DC where I came from 37 years ago and a lot of it is due to the influence of the white Berkeley and San Francisco Left. The Bay Area is a greatly overpriced hellhole. Stay away!</p>

		<p> Attorney General Holler seems to believe in our Constitution as much as he believes in the Code of Hammurabi! The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution clearly and specifically outlaws double-jeopardy. However, &#8220;our&#8221; government, in order to please angry minority mobs, appears to feel it can overrule legal state decisions by retiring them in Federal Courts. I am perfectly willing to accept the decision of jury in the Johannes Mehserle case. I can&rsquo;t say that Mr. Mehserle is getting off Scot-free. </p>
<p>I also disagree with those AR posters who are down on the cops. Police in my region of the South are some of the most race conscious people on the planet. They see what is really going on in our society and have no illusions regarding minority crime. I&rsquo;ve known plenty of Southern cops over the years and I generally like them and have never run afoul of them. I&rsquo;d personally rather have a few good Mississippi cops on my side than a whole battalion of Feds of any stripe.<br>

		<p>I look upon cops in big cities overrun by vicious ghetto blacks and Hispanics as soldiers on the front line of a two front war.  So as soldiers I give them far more leeway in their actions than I would, say, for a county deputy in the Midwest or in rural areas of the south.   </p>
<p>The first of the two fronts is the terror war on white people declared by blacks, of which most whites are grossly unaware. Each day the news is replete with crimes committed by blacks against white people. Of course the terrorist attacks in Wichita and Knoxville on young whites comes to mind.  These types of atrocities are carried out numerous times daily against innocent whites, simply because they are white.  </p>
<p>I view white cops as the only white people willing and able to extract a bit of pay back for the victims of ghetto thug violence.  Were I on the jury I would have voted not guilty for Johannes Mehserle simply because I have realized that blacks are no longer content with killing, raping, and maiming innocent whites, they are going after armed white cops as well. </p>
<p>This is an escalation.  Remember the four white cops gunned down by the black thug in Washington, State near Seattle? Remember the white cops killed by a black thug in Oakland recently? The black who was dispensed with by transit cop Mehserle is just another terrorist that a potential white victim will not have to fear.  Thank you officer Mehesrle.</p>
<p>Concerning the juries in these type cases, it&rsquo;s time for whites to do some O.J. verdicts of their own. I have adopted the Harold Covington attitude about trials, which he got from the IRA. This is that &#8220;no matter if a white man is guilty, the courts have lost the moral authority to judge them&#8221;.  On race issues the courts, prosecutors, and judges are corrupt. </p>
<p>Witness the black outrage when such incidents as discussed in the above article occur. This means that most blacks have the same ghetto attitude, if not outright support of black thuggery, at least their silence indicates agreement. Most likely they harbor a fantasy of self rule someday so as to be free of &#8220;cracker&#8221; law. </p>
<p>One should recall that not one credible member of the &#8220;black&#8221; community came forward with critical information against the killer of the four white cops near Seattle.  Blacks will willingly rat out their own for crimes against other blacks.  But, they will not turn on another black for a crime against a white.  Nor are they likely to convict a black for a crime against a white victim. </p>
<p>The second front is the civil war between two groups of whites. Nowhere is it more pronounced than on the west coast.  In California 53 percent of the white men voted for Obama.  By doing so they willingly participated in an act that will server to diminish their culture, language, and institutions.  Even before this nightmare was elected, whites were already in the back of the line.  During Obama&rsquo;s second term whites like those who supported him in California will find that they can&rsquo;t even get in the end of the line.  </p>
<p>Will Obama be reelected? Probably, simply because this large group of unaware whites pit themselves against those whites who are fighting in opposition to political and cultural suicide under a sea of brown and black third worlders. This will divide the white vote.  Witness the turmoil over the mildest of state laws passed in Arizona against illegal entrants.  Know nothing whites have joined with the cabal of Hispanics against Arizona and saner white people. If this divide continues, Obama will easily win.  <br>
 <br>
Then perhaps the real fun begins. Those white men who voted for O, who you see gathered around sports bars glued to the TV watching football, basketball, etc.,  wearing their favorite afleaks jersey, busting down beers, accepting commercials that denigrate whites, faun approvingly over the latest black actor,  and willing give up their daughters to blacks&hellip;&hellip;. will maybe wakeup.   <br>

		<p>Late breaking news:  Purportedly due to budget cuts, union problems and looming layoffs, the Oakland PD will no longer respond in person to reports of certain &#8220;minor&#8221; crimes.  Methinks the real reason b/c the results of the Mehserle case has scared white cops away from enforcing criminal law against Oakland&rsquo;s usual suspects.</p>
