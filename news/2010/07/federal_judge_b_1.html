			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, July 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal judge on Wednesday blocked some of the toughest provisions in the Arizona illegal immigration law, putting on hold the state&rsquo;s attempt to have local police enforce federal immigration policy.</p>
<p>Though the rest of the law is still set to go into effect Thursday, the partial injunction on SB 1070 means Arizona, for the time being, will not be able to require police officers to determine the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton also struck down the section of law that makes it a crime not to carry immigration registration papers and the provision that makes it a crime for an illegal immigrant to seek or perform work.</p>
<p>In all, Bolton struck down four sections of the law, the ones that opponents called the most controversial. Bolton said she was putting those sections on hold until the courts resolve the issues.</p>
<p>The ruling said the Obama administration, which sought the injunction, is likely to &#8220;succeed on the merits&#8221; in showing the above provisions are preempted by federal law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A number of provisions will still go into effect as the case is litigated. Arizona will be able to block state officials from so-called &#8220;sanctuary city&#8221; policies limiting enforcement of federal law; require that state officials work with federal officials on illegal immigration; allow civil suits over sanctuary cities; and make it a crime to pick up day laborers.</p>
<p>The ruling came just as police were making last-minute preparations to begin enforcement of the law and protesters were planning large demonstrations to speak out against the measure. At least one group planned to block access to federal offices, daring officers to ask them about their immigration status.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But supporters of the policy slammed the court&rsquo;s decision. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., called the ruling &#8220;misguided.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The federal government has a right and a responsibility to enforce existing laws, but when they fail to meet that responsibility, we should not stand in the way of the states that take action to respond to the very real threat of border violence, drug cartels and human smuggling,&#8221; he said in a written statement. &#8220;There&rsquo;s nowhere in the Constitution that says a state is limited to what it absolutely won&rsquo;t do and can be stopped for what it might do and to exercise a judgment against a state that has passed a law that is consistent with existing federal law is beyond absurd.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Localities inside Arizona were already preparing to interpret the law in different ways. The Tucson Unified School District&rsquo;s Governing Board approved by a 5-0 vote a policy Tuesday that maintains the district&rsquo;s stance of not enforcing immigration laws in the district&rsquo;s schools.</p>
<p>The hardest-line approach was expected in the Phoenix area, where Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio plans his 17th crime and immigration sweep. He planned to hold the sweep regardless of the ruling.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s my long take.  It&rsquo;s wordy, so I&rsquo;ll net it out by saying that any criticism we might have for the judge in this case is undeserved, as this was a procedural ruling, not a constitutional ruling, and her job wasn&rsquo;t to state her own opinion, but to assess the opinions of other judges that might take up the constitutional showdown.  The judge in this case only did her proper job.  </p>

		<p>Well there you are.  We knew this would be coming didn&rsquo;t we?  We didn&rsquo;t want to believe it would, as the State law is a mirror of the Federal law.  And it is LAWFULLY PASSED AND LAWFULLY done.  So what do we have then?  When we as citizens cannot trust our courts to uphold law itself, but instead work actively to thwart the laws of the land, all that is left is to enforce the laws ourselves (vigilantism), ride unlawfully ruling activist judges out on a rail (our founder&rsquo;s solution) until the ruling elites get the fear of God in them, or outright Revolution.  We have TRIED to do things within the legal and political system.  We WANT to do things that way.  It&rsquo;s in our nature.  It is NOT, however, in the ruling elite&rsquo;s nature to act in similar fashion.  The political process has become too corrupt, too arrogant, and much much too slow.  It would take decades to replace activist unlawfully ruling judges one by one as they retire with Constitutionally aware judges - and this is only IF we Constitutionalists and conservatives could obtain power through the political system long enough to do so.  With the Federal government actively flooding our country with third world, guaranteed votes for the Democrats and socialists, our window of opportunity for political solutions is very nearly over.</p>

<p>While there are a few gloating Hispanics and their sympathizers along with the ubiquitous anti-racists, the majority of comments express pure outrage.</p>
<p>The majority of Americans clearly want action taken on CRIMINAL aliens and that doesn&rsquo;t include amnesty or a pathway to citizenship.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping this ruling prompts voters to action and forces representatives to state their positions so the electorate knows where these people stand when they head to the voting booth.</p>

		<p>I concur. Even though I&rsquo;m not happy about these rulings, it is in cases like this standard procedure to stay enactment or enforcement of a law until its constitutionality can be decided. And if I&rsquo;m reading the article accurately, the cops will still have the ability to enforce the law on their own   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s just the State of Arizona can&rsquo;t *require* it.</p>

<p>And my hunch is that the law-abiding citizens of Arizona will just suck their thumbs, lick their wounds, and go back to work tomorrow forgetting that this ever happened. I mean, that&rsquo;s what our people have done ever since the &ldquo;Civil Rights&rdquo; era, right? That&rsquo;s what we did when a Federal judge struck down California&rsquo;s Proposition 187 that attempted to prevent illegal aliens from receiving health care, education, and other social services. We have mortgages to pay and football games to watch. Sure, it&rsquo;s too bad that Americans can&rsquo;t control their own destiny anymore, but we have jobs and we don&rsquo;t get paid to be career protesters.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The ruling said the Obama administration, which sought the injunction, is likely to &lsquo;succeed on the merits&rsquo; in showing the above provisions are preempted by federal law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, isn&rsquo;t that the most comforting thing you have ever read?</p>
<p>Laughably, the real comfort is to be found in the fact that &ldquo;the Obama administration,&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t seem to know the difference between existing federal laws and their radically fantasized  Marxist ideology of &ldquo;the winner takes it all&rdquo; and that they can do as they please now. Comrade BO and his fellow travelers are on a dangerous downward spiral, that they neither know how to stop, or really want to since they enjoy it so much; soon, that downward spiral is going to lead them to a crashing &ldquo;misfortune,&rdquo; that they will never recover from.</p>
<p>This might be: the November, 2, 2010 election; total defeat in the courts ultimately on this issue; or possibly, the sparking of a secessionist movement the likes of which have not been seen since 1860 in this country. If not worse or better, depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism has failed; it has failed, because its overlords &ldquo;precociously&rdquo; put in a &ldquo;savior&rdquo; that probably has trouble feeding himself anything but Red Jell-O.  This might have worked in 2024 or 2032, but not now. </p>
<p>There are just still too many whites left, to wake up and get angry with this nonsense. Or put another way, 65% or so of the population, is not a marginalized and desperate white minority to be abused by the 35% that fancy themselves the &ldquo;minority majority&rdquo; in both actions and incompetence, just yet.</p>
<p>May God be with us!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough about the law to say whether the #1 comment by &#8220;Question Diversity&#8221; is correct or not, but based on what I&rsquo;ve read it seems to me she was making a &#8220;pre-emptive&#8221; strike against SB 1070 in advance of the court case, making sure that her ruling becomes, ipso facto, a strong influence on further legal proceedings, greatly strengthening the forces who oppose it, and thereby weakening SB 1070&rsquo;s chances of surviving the trial.</p>
<p>In other words, a huge defeat for us. </p>

		<p>My understanding of the judge&rsquo;s ruling is that she thinks the Obama Admin&rsquo;s lawsuit has merit, has a good chance of winning, therefore the the parts of the law that are relevant cannot go into effect until the lawsuit is settled one way or another.</p>
<p>One of the parts of the lawsuit that she thinks are most compelling is the fact that if AZ law enforcement enforce the law, it will create such a burden on Fed agents, that it will cause them to not be able to do their job, thus getting in the way of the Fed Govt&rsquo;s &#8220;supreme&#8221; authority on immigration issues.</p>
<p>This annoys the h*ll out of me. </p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m understanding this right, here&rsquo;s what the situation looks like to me: </p>
<p>For political reasons, Fed Govt refuses to do its job to stop illegal immigration. </p>
<p>In response, AZ passes a law which merely allows AZ law enforcement to do what the Fed Govt refuses to do.</p>
<p>In response to that, the courts rule that the law is unconstitutional because it&rsquo;s not right for state police to &#8220;burden&#8221; Fed agents with illegals picked up by state law enforcement. It interferes with Fed policy (which again, is to do nothing and not enforce the country&rsquo;s laws).</p>
<p>Am I getting this right? Surreal, simply surreal.</p>
<p>This feeds my fears that no democratically arrived at solutions to illegal immigration are to be allowed by those in power. Every time the courts step in to thwart the popular will, it chips away at the legitimacy of the system. Alarming, to say the least.</p>

		<p>No sane White Man is happy about this. However:<br>
We have another &#8220;talking point&#8221; to convince the Whites who are on the fence.  This is a shining example of how much the federal government and the neo-Marxists hate White Men.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&rsquo;t about Mexico. Nobody is flooding Mexico with millions of illegal non-Mexicans, giving them free welfare, health care, and special privileges under the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to be a minority in my own country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m White, we used to be 90% in &#8216;65, now we&rsquo;re 65%. That&rsquo;s genocide. The open borders policy continues the White Genocide, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m against it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>@4 -  yes, that is correct. This is where most people fail to recognize the wink.   The state cannot &#8216;enforce&rsquo; that officers check immigration status.  It does not state that it prevents the officers from checking on their own b/c they &#8216;choose&rsquo; to follow up.  The law starts tomorrow.  I&rsquo;m sure this was done to soften the blow, threats, protests, and strikes that will occur.   A few weeks/months from now, they will find the law constitutional and then they&rsquo;ll just tack it back on and it will then be &#8216;too late&rsquo; for the illegals to fight it.  </p>

		<p>There is no doubt in my mind that we are going to have to fight - literally - to take this country back.  The forces of political correctness are initiating a counterattack.  They&rsquo;re not going to give up the fight to destroy White people.  It is they who really have the power.  They are the ones who&rsquo;ve had the initiative since the 1960&rsquo;s.  They&rsquo;re going to try and put this law down hard as an example to all Whites who think that they&rsquo;re going to stop illegal immigration.</p>
<p>This is just a perversion of sanity.  Arizona is trying to protect it&rsquo;s borders against the tide of illegal immigration and they&rsquo;re meeting with resistance from all sides.  Doesn&rsquo;t this prove that there&rsquo;s an agenda by a group of people to destroy this country?  No nation that cannot or refuses to protect its borders can last.  This is what the power elite want.  If White people don&rsquo;t wake up to this agenda - and fast - the only way to stop it is going to be a revolution.  We will not go quietly into the night.</p>

<p>I have more details in my rant that I link to in 1, but not only are you correct, but Joe Arpaio was just on the Michael Alan Weiner show and confirmed it   &mdash;   That part of SB 1070 was meant to force Hispandering AZ police agencies to check, and it has been temporarily put aside.  But that does not mean that sane LEAs in AZ, e.g. Arpaio&rsquo;s, have to stop checking.  They have all along, and will still be able to starting tomorrow, and can right now.  Also, the part of 1070 that bans sanctuary cities wasn&rsquo;t even challenged by the DOJ, so it will stand, and as of tomorrow, no more sanctuary cities in AZ.  That sanctuary city provision also applies to the state as a whole, so the State DPS (functions like a highway patrol or state police) can do these checks if all else fails.</p>
<p>My point is, everyone is freaking out over today&rsquo;s ruling.  Our side is fit to be tied, and the other side is cheering in the streets, when in reality, both sides are mistaken.  Everyone should just take a cold shower and then calm down.  If you don&rsquo;t believe my interpretation, you can read the actual ruling by the actual judge.</p>

This can only lead to decades of brutal, depraved and mindless violence on all sides, with the losers being wiped out or expelled. That very well could be us unless we start fighting back now more strenuously than ever, before it gets to the point where our ballots will be in the form of bombs, bullets, and piles of corpses.</p>

		<p>I think that a lot of people fail to realize the futility of enforcing the Arizona law. The United States Department of Immigration,Customs Enforcement (ICE) has stated that they will release the illegals as quickly as they are turned over to them by local law enforcement. The illegals are not going to be deported if the federal government has anything to say about it.</p>

<p>Did Question Diversity at 6:09 PM just land here from Mars?  Look a judge can rule either way.  Remember each side presented good arguments.  A judge simply takes the one that she likes.  In this case she liked the anti-white side.  There is no legally correct ruling encased in sound logic.</p>
<p>The judge could have easily said that Arizona has a right and duty to police its territory so that the citizens are safe.  </p>
<p>If the Federal Government thinks that there is something amiss it must show with certainty that that is the case.  Until such proof is offered the state of Arizona has an obligation to keep its citizens safe.</p>
<p>For heaven&rsquo;s sake if a judge can rule that homosexuals have a right to marry, a judge can find the Emanations from a Penumbra to rule anything legal or illegal.<br>

		<p>And now for some good news out of Arizona:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Starting today, Arizona residents at least 21 years old can carry a concealed weapon without a permit.</p>
<p>The change is part of a broad weapons law by state Sen. Russell&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I heard Russell Pearce speak yesterday on my radio program, rather than sounding defeated, he appeared to be upbeat, optimistic, ready to forge ahead with 1070 and more determined than ever.  He believes the 9th Circuit (know as the 9th Circus) will overturn judge bolton&rsquo;s ruling and that she issued a temporary stay against 1070.  </p>
<p>He also stated that Federal Immigration laws, the exact same ones addressed in 1070, remain in effect and that Sheriff Arpio and the Phoenix PD plan to continue illegal colonist sweeps, as per Federal Law.  Sheriff Arpio has set aside a portion of his outdoor jail specifically for illegal colonists, calling it Section 1070.</p>
<p>Pearce stated that members of the Phoenix police department are behind him, a lot of them, support him, have already gone against their Pro-Open Borders police chief and are filing numerous lawsuits as   &#8220;it remains allowable for Arizona residents to file suit against any agency, official, city or county for adopting policies restricting enforcement of federal immigration law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Russell Pearce, of Mesa and co-sponsor of SB1070, is confident that today&rsquo;s ruling left in place vital provisions that will aid in combating illegal immigration.<br>
 Pearce stated: &#8216;At midnight tonight, sanctuary policies by cities and towns in the State of Arizona will be illegal. The ruling is a key victory for the State, in its efforts to enforce federal laws against illegal immigration.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pearce also believes that the provisions struck down by Bolton will successfully be appealed, saying: &#8216;With past rulings supporting Arizona&rsquo;s employer sanctions law, the courts have made it clear states have the inherent power to enforce the laws of this country. I am confident that the courts will back the provisions in SB 1070 temporarily blocked by Judge Bolton.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Do not give up hope.  Russell Pearce certainly isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Remember:  Our mortal enemies on the left, those who are hell-bent on destroying our country and its economy via expanding, treasury-draining foreign wars, unfettered non-White immigration, Cloward-Piven strategies (flooding the welfare system), passing anti-White legislation, massive printing of fiat currency which debases the dollar, never ever ever give up or admit defeat.  They regroup and attack, relentlessly, mercilessly and repeatedly  &mdash;  and they&rsquo;ve been very successful at doing this.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t learn from their tactics and fight fire with fire, we will be defeated  &mdash;  we are almost at the point of no return as it is, &#8216;One Minute to Midnight&rsquo; as Jupiter writes.</p>

<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t yet landed.  As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;m still on Mars, devising a cunning and sophisticated plan to collect all of your souls&hellip;BWAHAHAHAHA&hellip;</p>
<p>Seriously, I don&rsquo;t think the judge really had much in the way of latitude.  This was a procedural ruling based on an emergency filing by the DOJ, not a constitutional ruling.  From her line of questioning last week, I think if her purview were Constitutional, she might not have struck down much.</p>
<p>What gets me is why the DOJ challenged the &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; provision because of the burden it would create for ICE (while hypocritically also claiming it preempts Federal responsibility), and the judge temporarily put it on hold based on what she thought judges in the AZ trial level, the 9th Circus and/or SCOTUS might do, not her opinion of the constitutionality.  But DOJ didn&rsquo;t even challenge the sanctuary city provision, therefore it&rsquo;s state law right now.  Now that the state is forcing all the sanctuary cities and counties in AZ not to be so, that&rsquo;s going to create a lot of work for ICE.</p>
<p>The reason I&rsquo;m so adamant about this is that everyone is needlessly going bonkers   &mdash;   I&rsquo;m hearing people on our side, on lamestream conservative talk radio, not the fruit and nut websites, call for this judge&rsquo;s hanging and for violent revolution, and the other side, the Mecha morons, the Razatards, the LULAC loons and the white libtards are literally dancing in the streets, so they&rsquo;re ten times worse.  Neither side should be doing what it&rsquo;s doing.  I&rsquo;d personally defend this judge&rsquo;s personal safety if I could, because all it would take is as much for some kook on our side to give her as much as a paper cut, and it would be all over for us.</p>
<p>As it is, AZ is going to appeal this ruling to the 9th circus, who will surely find for the DOJ, but then appeal to SCOTUS when they come back into session in early October.  Though I should say again, these appeals will be on the procedural motion, not the constitutional chops of 1070.  Any future rulings by the 9th or SCOTUS shouldn&rsquo;t have too much written into them:  If, for instance, SCOTUS finds 7-2 that the trial level judge violated court precedent in the realm of facial challenges in enjoining the provisions that she did, that shouldn&rsquo;t mean that SCOTUS would vote 7-2 to find all of 1070 constitutional when it gets to them in several years.  </p>
<p>Please, people, calm down.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was going over some old newspapers saved from right after 9/11. In light of the tremendous wave of patriotism and outrage  that folllowed those attacks, who would ever have imagined, back then,  that now, only 9 years later, we would have come to this?</p>
<p>Considering how all that outrage was quickly stifled or re-directed away from Moslems and illegal aliens, and the alien invasion has been allowed to continue, it is more obvious than ever that this invasion and re-population of our country is given absolutely TOPMOST PRIORITY  by those in control.  Even after mass shootings on military bases in various parts of the world, and on college campuses here at home   &mdash;   all unthinkable immediately after 9/11   &mdash;   the re-population program continues unabated, without losing a step,  while the givernment spits in our faces.</p>
<p>Can there be any greater proof that they are desperate to get this program done and completed, at any cost, and as soon as possible?</p>

		<p>Arizona is not a rogue state. We are tired of unlimited unending immigration and the attacks against us that wish for less legal and zero illegal immigration.<br>
there are 5 billion people that make less than the average poor Mexican streaming across our border looking for work, do we let them all in? Ten percent of Central America is now in the USA and the fastest growing group of undocumented workers are not Hispanic but Indians and Chinese overstaying their visas. Do we let ten percent of Africa and Asia and India to come as we have let Central America? NO? Why not?</p>
<p>I am a lifelong Democrat,I voted for Carter and Gore.</p>
<p>I plan in the future to vote for the candidate that has the best immigration voting record as found on Numbersusa.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if the candidate is a Democrat or Republican or the Tea party or even the Black Panther party, if they want to reduce legal immigration and eliminate illegal immigration, then they get my vote, time and money!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I am alone on this either.</p>
<p>Immigration is a tax on the working poor here now and the mostly fraudulent worker visa programs are taking the few middle class jobs left. plus we are on track to reach nearly a half a billion via immigration in a few decades, only to please those that benefit from immigration while passing the social costs onto the communities.<br>
Immigration moratorium NOW!<br>

Yeah, Jupiter, but what about the presidents before Obama. This country was flooded with illegals long before Obama became president. Clinton and Bush II caused the most damage. And how about Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s 1986 amnesty. Ever since that amnesty they are pouring over the border.</p>

		<p>In answer to poster 1, this was a totally brazen political ruling by a hack judge pushing a leftist and personal agenda. To make her decision believable, she had to bring in irrelevancies contortions.   </p>
<p>Her job is to rule on the constitutionality of the law not to concern herself with such things as the Feds being suddenly burdened with thousands of illegals, (poor overworked Feds).  </p>
<p>She chose instead to leave the burden on Arizonans and not place it on Obama and the DHS and CBP where it belongs.  Nor should she concern herself with what other judges might rule in the 9th or at the supreme court.   </p>
<p>It could be that she felt in a bad dilemma.  If she threw the law out completely, she faced the possibility of civil unrest by white people in Arizona,(don&rsquo;t laugh, it could happen),and help defeat Obama in 2012. </p>
<p>If she approved it, there was a 100 percent assurance of riots, disorder, demands, looting, and general mayhem by &#8220;Hispanics&#8221;, many bused in from Mexico.  So, she likely saw herself as a peacemaker and thus ruled &#8220;Piecemeally&#8221;. </p>
<p>Perhaps worse, by upholding 1070 she surely would lose face and be forced to endure the cold shoulders and snubs of her leftist pals at cocktail hour, while, on the other hand, Arizonans would only lose their state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disingenuous to give her any credit at all. </p>
<p>Maybe her convoluted reasoning really was, as poster 1 indicated, that the Feds have only about 25% chance of success on appeal. This made it even more urgent for her to strike the key elements of 1070, because&hellip;&hellip;  </p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;Had the law stood she knew that during the time it took for appeals to the supreme dorks, other states would have passed similar laws.  Thus real immigration enforcement would have begun in earnest and millions of superior persons deported.  A ruling against the states by the dorks at that point would be disastrous. She realized all this. </p>
<p>Besides, she has her eyes on a promotion as a circuit judge or even, &#8220;dare she say, dare she say?&#8221; a supreme dork? She knows that without illegal votes from Mexicans combined with mass amnesty, Obama will be voted out, along with any real chance she might have at the big leagues. She was born in 1951, so this is her last chance. This ruling does, however, place her in good graces of Obama for the next big promotion.</p>
<p>She also realizes that by the time the appeals reaches SCOTUS, as early as 2012, it&rsquo;s likely that the &#8220;conservative&#8221; 5-4 majority will be a 4-5 minority and her ruling will be safe. Her job was to holdup 1070 long enough to get that leftist majority.   </p>
<p>On doing a quick review of this judge&rsquo;s bio, it appears that she never had a real job.  She&rsquo;s been an academic mole all her life and therefore knows little.   Yah, Yah, she was an ambulance chaser for about ten years, that doesn&rsquo;t count.  </p>
<p>For the benefit of all, including herself, she should resign and get a job in alignment with her real abilities, Wal-Mart greeter&hellip;&hellip;..in Hispano Tucson. </p>

		<p>@23,</p>
<p>QD, unfortunately, the timing of the issue IS what is at stake here, for two reasons:</p>
<p>1.  The Mob we call The People have the collective memories of goldfish.<br>
Our saturation-angst media has helped insure that.  Given 2-3-4-7 years to cook this out in the appeals process, for procedural and then Constitutional reasons; it will be all too easy to put it to a death by indecision with NO reporting &#8216;behind closed doors&rsquo;.  Long after Americans have stopped caring.  Which is particularly crucial given the cowardly and lackadaisacal manner in which the other States have failed to follow up with their own bills.  No critical mass = no overriding proof of public interest.</p>
<p>2.  We are indeed on a clock here.<br>
If we want Democrats out of Congressional majority in 2010, we need to have something to lash them with.  Continuously.  If we want Obama out in 2012, we need to freeze his ability to pencil whip legislation through both houses so that his appearance of a clueless, hapless, incompetent just continues to become more and more apparent.  Comparitively, what we DO NOT need is another 7-10 years of mass immigration with no letup in the demographics shifts while this thing cooks in court.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:<br>
If there was a -mass- response, not only would our so-called leadership have to pay a terrifying price for refusing to listen to the stated Will Of The People, but you would not see the one thing that is almost certain to arise from this: a bi-partisan deal on Amnesty in trade for enforcement-after (which will also never happen because the illegals will be called &#8216;temporary workers&rsquo; and still stay as long as they want&hellip;).</p>
<p>That said, the only way Federal preemption can be applied is if:</p>
<p>1.  The State law is in stark contradiction to existing national <br>
    policy.</p>
<p>2.  If the Federal law is already so heavily enumerated with <br>
    detail elements that even congruent State equivalents are <br>
    not applicable because they don&rsquo;t cover the same areas as <br>
    thoroughly.</p>
<p>We already know that standing Federal legislation is already in accordance with the blanket intent of the Arizona law, it&rsquo;s just not being enforced.  Which should have already bought Obama a ride to jail as Chief Executor (and several POTUS&rsquo; before him).</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t have is a _detailed_ set of Congressionally mandated overrides to the status of illegal immigrants in this nation which defacto supercedes all State policies, specifically those which Arizona puts forward.</p>
<p>And since Congress is owned by the Elites (don&rsquo;t even pretend you &#8216;vote for the one you want&rsquo;, promises are just words) any technicality driven procedural objection is but a guarantee of new legislation beating the any followup Constitutional argument to the punch.  And thus keeping the SCOTUS out of a fight that their masters cannot win, at present.</p>
<p>This is also why the Republicans are doing nothing.  They are also incumbents with many immigration-soft = replaceable members that could benefit from a sea change in opinion on this hot button topic.</p>
<p>But they won&rsquo;t do it because they know that an &#8216;Emergency Compromise Bill&rsquo; is already set to make SB1070 outmoded as much as inapplicable.</p>
<p>You are foolishly advocating a &#8216;wait and see&rsquo; expectation in a scenario that _will never happen_ because the scenario itself is about to change.  And all&rsquo;s the Democrats need to do is hold out through November based on the strength of this &#8216;initial victory&rsquo; in the race wars and the Republicans will give in.  Just like they always do.</p>

		<p>  Is there any clearer example that the Feds HATE white people?  We should encourage every white person who is thinking of joining the military services to abandon such foolish pursuits.  Why should they fight for and defend a &#8220;nation&#8221; that hates them, in its global, imperialistic adventurism?
