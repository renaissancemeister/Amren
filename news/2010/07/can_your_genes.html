			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barbara Bradley Hagerty, National Public Radio, July 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When the police arrived at Bradley Waldroup&rsquo;s trailer home in the mountains of Tennessee, they found a war zone. There was blood on the walls, blood on the carpet, blood on the truck outside, even blood on the Bible that Waldroup had been reading before all hell broke loose.</p>
<p>Assistant District Attorney Drew Robinson says that on Oct. 16, 2006, Waldroup was waiting for his estranged wife to arrive with their four kids for the weekend. He had been drinking, and when his wife said she was leaving with her friend, Leslie Bradshaw, they began to fight. Soon, Waldroup had shot Bradshaw eight times and sliced her head open with a sharp object. When Waldroup was finished with her, he chased after his wife, Penny, with a machete, chopping off her finger and cutting her over and over.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutors charged Waldroup with the felony murder of Bradshaw, which carries the death penalty, and attempted first-degree murder of his wife. It seemed clear to them that Waldroup&rsquo;s actions were intentional and premeditated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was a pretty straightforward case. Even Waldroup said so during his trial last year. He said on the murderous night, he just &#8220;snapped,&#8221; and he admitted that he killed Leslie Bradshaw and attacked his wife. &#8220;I&rsquo;m not proud of none of it,&#8221; Waldroup said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>A Dangerous Mix</b></p>
<p>Richardson says he realized that the testimony at trial would be &#8220;very graphic.&#8221; The defense team, he says, did not try to dismantle the graphic evidence but rather sought to &#8220;give a broader and fuller picture of what that was.&#8221;</p>
<p>How to do that? The answer, it turned out, lay in Bradley Waldroup&rsquo;s genes.</p>
<p>Immediately, Richardson went to forensic psychiatrist William Bernet of Vanderbilt University and asked him to give Waldroup a psychiatric evaluation. Bernet also took a blood sample and brought it to Vanderbilt&rsquo;s Molecular Genetics Laboratory. Since 2004, Bernet and laboratory director Cindy Vnencak-Jones have been analyzing the DNA of people like Waldroup.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve tested some 30 criminal defendants, most of whom were charged with murder. They were looking for a particular variant of the MAO-A gene  &mdash;  also known as the warrior gene because it has been associated with violence. Bernet says they found that Waldroup has the high-risk version of the gene.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Over the fierce opposition of prosecutors, the judge allowed Bernet to testify in court that these two factors help explain why Waldroup snapped that murderous night.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&rsquo;t say these things made him become violent, but they certainly constituted a risk factor or a vulnerability,&#8221; Bernet says.</p>
<p>Bernet cited scientific studies over the past decade that found that the combination of the high-risk gene and child abuse increases one&rsquo;s chances of being convicted of a violent offense by more than 400 percent. He notes that other studies have not found a connection between the MAO-A gene and violence  &mdash;  but he told the jury that he felt the genes and childhood abuse were a dangerous cocktail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Genetics, or Smoke and Mirrors?</b></p>
<p>The genetic testing was only one piece of Waldroup&rsquo;s defense. His attorneys also argued that Waldroup was depressed, suffered from &#8220;intermittent explosive disorder&#8221; and acted in the heat of passion. Still, defense co-attorney Shari Tayloe Young says the genetic evidence was critical.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutor Drew Robinson thinks this genetic evidence is &#8220;smoke and mirrors,&#8221; aimed at confusing the jury.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more of this information that you put before a jury, the [greater the] chances of confusing them and drawing their attention away from the facts and onto some other aspects of the case,&#8221; Robinson says. &#8220;You always run that risk. And I just think that&rsquo;s asking the jury to grasp ahold of a little bit too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>To rebut Bernet&rsquo;s testimony, Robinson called in his own expert: psychiatrist Terry Holmes, the clinical director of Moccasin Bend Mental Health Institute in Chattanooga, Tenn. Holmes urged the jury to ignore it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Holmes says it&rsquo;s way too early to use this research in a court of law. And he believes Bernet is spinning the data.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Genetic Evidence a Factor</b></p>
<p>But Lard says the genetic evidence did figure into a major decision  &mdash;  whether to find Waldroup guilty of murder and impose the death penalty. The jurors concluded that his actions were not premeditated and agreed with the defense argument that Waldroup just exploded.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another juror, Debbie Beaty, says the science helped persuade her that Waldroup was not entirely in control of his actions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And even though prosecutors tried to play down the genetic evidence, Beaty felt it was a major factor.</p>
<p>&#8220;A diagnosis is a diagnosis, it&rsquo;s there,&#8221; she says. &#8220;A bad gene is a bad gene.&#8221;</p>
<p>After 11 hours of deliberation, the jury convicted Waldroup of voluntary manslaughter  &mdash;  not murder  &mdash;  and attempted second-degree murder.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Scientists and legal experts expect to see more cases like this as neuroscience makes inroads into the courtroom, and presents guilt and innocence  &mdash;  not in terms of black and white  &mdash;  but in shades of gray.<br/>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t understand people who somehow dismiss the concept of culpability whenever there is a question of genetic predisposition to crime.</p>
<p>If a person has a genetic predisposition to be violent, locking the person away for a long period of time makes even more sense than simply dismissing the notion of culpability and freeing the person.  </p>
<p>Today, the idea of incarceration is not so much about punishment or rehabilitation, but rather is for protection of society.  If a person murders someone, but claims that his genes were responsible, he is in essence admitting that he is not in control and is therefore even more dangerous to society.  These kinds of people should therefore be executed.</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s a serious misnomer to call the MAO-A gene a &#8220;warrior&#8221; gene.  The kind of behavior on the part of those who have it is hardly that of a true warrior, it is that of a coward and a bully.  I think they just call it &#8220;warrior&#8221; because they know that there are racial differences (or that such will be found) in the gene&rsquo;s distribution, and want to gloss over the situation with semantics.</p>
<p>However, the fact that Mr. Waldroup has this gene is actually the argument to give him the death penalty, not spare him of it.  It guarantees that his particular version will not be promulgated to future generations of cowards.</p>

		<p>Interesting work by the lawyers. In pre-insanity days, however, the court would punish the defendant even more, to send a message to every other carrier of this gene that &#8216;explosions&rsquo; wont be tolerated. </p>

<p>  I agree. If a convicted murderer is shown to have a genetic predisposition to killing, wouldn&rsquo;t it be safer to have him or her executed? After all, if they are released, aren&rsquo;t they just as likely to kill again? If they escape from prison, like Ted Bundy, they will probably kill again. It sounds like these genetic criminals can&rsquo;t be rehabilitated, which (according to liberals) is supposed to be the whole purpose of prison.</p>

I&rsquo;ve seen two news programs report on different broadcasts that reported that a boy given up for adoption and later discovered to be a rapist had both been conceived as results of rapes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d bet that the gene or the drive for sexual aggression can be found in rapists and their offspring.</p>

		<p>As the commedian Flip Wilson used to say, &#8220;The devil made me do it.&#8221; However in reality he only tempts people to do evil.  Notice the only difference between devil and evil is the letter d. Plus ms. Beaty is a perfect example of the rule of law being decided by 12 people who weren&rsquo;t intelligent enough to escape jury duty. She should be proud of allowing this creep to escape the death penalty, I wonder if she would have voted the same if either of the victims were a relative or friend of hers? </p>

		<p>A word of caution. The &#8216;liberal&#8221; orthodoxy is NOT that the perpetrator&rsquo;s genes (or race) aren&rsquo;t co-responsible for the crime. Many &#8220;liberals&#8221; will actually argue that some may be more likely to commit an act of violence because of their genetic background, which they often bring up as a mitigating circumstance in order to get the &#8220;minority&#8221; criminal off the hook.</p>
<p>What the &#8220;liberal&#8221; orthodoxy says is that it is racist to bring this fact up <i>before</i> the fact. So, if you are concerned that admitting millions with genetic predisposition to criminal/asocial behavior will have its detrimental effect on the society then you are a racist. But as soon as these millions are in and break the law, it is perfectly OK to claim that it was their (genetic) nature that made them do it, so that they should not be punished for actions that are not of their fault.<br/>

		<p>I heard this on NPR on the way to work this morning. As a lawyer, I had a bit of a different take on the defense&rsquo;s argument.  They were not arguing that the defendant was not culpable.  They were arguing that his &#8220;make-up&#8221; meant that he did not meet the standard for premeditated murder.  Thus, he could not be guilty of first degree murder, but rather 2nd degree murder (or whatever it is in that state).  Despite what many people think, the standard for what is &#8220;premeditated&#8221; is not cut and dry.  There is a lot of room for argument of both sides.  They were trying to argue that his act was something done &#8220;in the heat of passion,&#8221; and that they could show this through an analysis of his genes.  That is to say, whereas a normal person would have had to premeditate a murder like that, the defendant here did not.  He simply &#8220;could not help it.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Now, since my first week in law school I have these distinctions to be mainly bogus.  I my opinion, the person who can get so worked-up and emotionally distressed enough to murder is worse than the mafioso who premeditates a murder of a rival for business reasons.  </p>
<p>Thus, IMO, if I found that the defendant simply acted on impulse because he was genetically predisposed to act on impulse, then I find that worse than someone who premeditates a murder.  </p>
<p>For example, I might feel reasonably safe being alone with a man who premeditated the murder of his wife 20 years ago because she had a $1 million life insurance policy.  But I would never feel that way around someone who has to &#8220;flip&#8221; before they murder.  </p>

		<p>8 Anonymous:</p>
<p>The last line in your post is cruelly ironic, and in fact leads into your point.  You&rsquo;d never be alone with the man who premeditated the murder of his wife 20 years ago for her insurance policy, because they&rsquo;d at least keep him in prison for life if not get him the drip.  The man who &#8220;flips&#8221; would be the one they&rsquo;d let out after 20 years, because Murder 2 often has finite prison terms that aren&rsquo;t anywhere near the murderer&rsquo;s full life span.</p>
<p>Put it another way   &mdash;   I think it&rsquo;s an insult to the victims of Murder 2 that their perps often don&rsquo;t get life terms.  Are we to think that a man murdered by another man as a result of a drunken fight outside a bar isn&rsquo;t any less dead than the woman whose husband knocks her off for her life insurance?  IOW, to imprison the former murderer for 20 years, and give the latter the death penalty, means that the former victim isn&rsquo;t as much as a human being as the latter victim.  I suppose the law thinks in a subtle sense that the former victim had it coming because he mouthed off fighting words outside the bar.  Using that standard, maybe the wife had it coming because she took out a life insurance policy   &mdash;   can&rsquo;t she be blamed in a sense for her own murder?</p>

		<p>Bradley Waldroup may well have a genetic propensity for committing violence.  Indeed, by virtue of their higher testosterone levels every man could fairly be said to have a genetic propensity for carrying out violence relative to women.  But nobody argues that this should lead to more lenient sentences for male murderers than female murderers.<br/>

		<p>The genes of White Humanity make us believe that if we accept Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and Saviour, no only will we get to go to Heaven forever, but we must also demand that blacks  come into our churches and build spirit filled multicultural communities.  If the blacks avoid us and our compassion, we actually believe that our beloved White Christ commands us to send our beautiful and naive young White Daughters out into American black ghettos, Haitian slums, and African jungles on outreach missions.</p>
<p>White genes are the curse of White Mankind.</p>
<p>Jesus isn&rsquo;t the problem.  He never went to Africa, so we can compliment his good sense while doing as he did- stay away from Africans, especially that most obnoxious, indolent, ignorant, violent and dangerous species offensively named &#8220;African American,&#8221; or as is said in higher cirlces of Whiteness, &#8220;Africaneas Americanus.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The problem with the American criminal justice system is that its objective, theoretically, continues to be about punishment instead of prevention.  Luckily, the system has, in the last two or three decades, responded with sentencing laws that result in some prevention of further crimes.  There are more three-strikes and habitual offender statutes, more life-without-parole mandates, more minors tried as adults, and less parole.  I heard on a TV documentary that CA now paroles only 1% of those eligible each year.  <br/>
Anyone convicted of felonies on three separate occasions, in my opinion, has proven himself unfit to ever walk the streets again.</p>

		<p>In The Bell Curve Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray argued that those with low IQs are tempted by crime because it is the only way they can acquire very much money.  <br/>
 <br/>
I believe in a genetic predisposition to engage in crime that is independent of IQ, which of course is also largely of genetic determination.  It would explain why there are brilliant criminals.<br/>
 <br/>
At any rate, the implication of crime genes is not toward leniency; it is against rehabilitation. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m actually against the needle for any single crime, simply for what is shown here.  Rather than make a mistake and kill a man who may be &#8216;genetically incompetent&rsquo; to restrain his adult drinking and release of violent tendencies, the jury choose guilt on lesser offenses _included in the indictment_ resulting in incarceration less than what the act itself deserves.</p>
<p>And, for the sake of mercy, nobody gets justice.</p>
<p>I do think that three strikes and you&rsquo;re dead is an applicable standard.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t believe in clogging up the system with cut and dry cases by stacking multiple offenses atop each other just to get shotgun coverage on some of them.  Prosecute the top count you think you can get a verdict on.  Then get the guy to confess at sentencing in a way that proves only he knows the details well enough to be the perpetrator.</p>
<p>And then supply penalty phases that reflect his cooperation in providing a shortened trial and lower costs.  2-4-6-10 year sentences keep the prisons empty and the society as a whole free of habitual repeat offenders -faster- than paying a criminal the equivalent of 40,000 dollars a year for TWO DECADES, to be housed in a box.</p>
<p>After he&rsquo;s done his dime, strap a GPS ankle bracelet on the guy.  Feed him generic groceries delivered to a &#8216;known criminal&rsquo; apartment complex off in the woods (next to the real prison so landvalues don&rsquo;t tank).</p>
<p>And make sure he never buys so much as a can of beer ever again.  Give him sufficient amenities (cable) to stay somewhat happy.  And write him off.  Since a felony murder wrap on any job application certainly does the same in society&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>The key thing here being that you could do all of this on a 10-15,000 a year basis of cooperative house arrest FOR THE SAME TWO DECADES.  After which, as a 50-60 year old, he&rsquo;s gonna be pretty much detoothed anyway.</p>
<p>We are not sheep.  We know not to go to bad parts of town.  We know to travel in groups after dark.  We know to carry weapons when the situation requires it (pepper spray, tazer or equivalent if not CC firearms).  We know NEVER to expose our children to drunks, even when they are related.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time we started also &#8216;knowing&rsquo; that there are a lot better ways to spend the amount of money we throw away to criminal incarceration efforts.  Like on our kids&rsquo; education.</p>
<p>And for those that choose not to live a life apart, that third strike is a killer.</p>
<p>The real danger of multicult and &#8216;diversity&rsquo; driven societies is that we never stop to think what the obvious solution of industrializing the judicial system means in absolute cost terms as an economic dragline on our prosperity.</p>

		<p>I posted the below comment to the original NPR article. To my utter amazement, my comment has not yet been yanked : </p>
<p>&hellip;/&hellip;</p>
<p>Posted on : <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128043329" rel="nofollow">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128043329</a></p>
<p>When I saw this article I knew what NPR was doing, and I knew that the perp was going to be a white male. </p>
<p>Sure enough, I scrolled down and saw that NPR had stuck to their usual narrative. </p>
<p>And for god measure, they first showed the black detective who was responsible for busting this evil white male. </p>
<p>Adult black males (bm&rsquo;s) are only 4% of the US population but they commit 60% of the violent crime (Department of Justice crime stats). </p>
<p>But of course NPR will never say this, nor will they likely post this comment. </p>
<p>It would be noble and honourable if they did - an affirmation of NPR&rsquo;s commitment to free speech - but free speech and hate facts are something that the loony white-hating left finds despicable. </p>
<p>Shame on you NPR for skewing the facts about violent crime and the genetic predispositions that lead to it. <br/>
