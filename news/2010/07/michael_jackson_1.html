<h1>Michael Jackson&rsquo;s Neverland As Calif. State Park?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Torey van Oot, Sacramento Bee, July 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As home to pop legend Michael Jackson, Neverland Ranch housed a working locomotive, a Ferris wheel and other amusement park rides, a 10,000-volume library and a zoo.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A resolution is in the works to order state parks officials to study converting the roughly 2,600-acre property into a state park. The state NAACP is backing the idea, and a lawmaker has signaled he is on board to carry the legislation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Michael&rsquo;s history is world history and I think it would become the No. 1 attraction for the state parks if we could pull it off,&#8221; said state NAACP President Alice Huffman, who also serves on the state Parks Commission.</p>
<p>Huffman said in addition to celebrating Jackson&rsquo;s contributions to music and pop culture, Neverland would join Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park as state parks honoring African Americans. Those factors, she said, would make Neverland a &#8220;great, great addition to the state parks system.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The property is controlled by Santa Monica-based Colony Capitol LCC, a private- equity firm that acquired the ranch when Jackson was facing foreclosure in 2008. The company declined to comment, though company President Thomas J. Barrack Jr. told Bloomberg News last month that he hoped to sell it for more than $100 million.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, Huffman said the historic value of the property makes the idea worth exploring, even if profit levels are questionable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if it breaks even, when you&rsquo;re preserving history and you&rsquo;re making it available to the public, there are other values too that are assigned more than the money,&#8221; Huffman said. &#8220;I think it would be a money-maker, but (more importantly) I think it&rsquo;s a piece of California history and world history that ought to be preserved.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Is Elvis&rsquo; Graceland a state park? Why shouldn&rsquo;t Jackson&rsquo;s property be treated the same way? Ultimately the public will be the judge of how long Jackson is remembered and what he is remembered for, as well as whether his property is preserved.</p>

		<p>Following the example of Graceland, the ranch could have been operated by the Jackson family as an ongoing concern. Or, if the owner wanted to donate the property, and operating expenses could be covered with admission fees, then I could see California taking it over. They would probably see a net gain from tourism.</p>
<p>But to buy the property? California buying the property? Somebody has a screw loose.</p>
<p>But then again, money is no object when pandering to minorities.</p>
<p>This is a vivid example of the odd priorities of the NAACP. I also think the posthumous embrace of Michael Jackson by blacks is passing strange. It&rsquo;s not like he wanted anything to do with them, or to look like them, when he was alive.</p>

		<p>I guess the question(s) is, how much of the absent taxpayers coffers do the owners of Neverland expect to haul in?  Will taxpayers want this expenditure at this time.  And is the State ready to run an amusement park?  Is the state ready to be sued for personal injuries sustained on rides that will eventually not be able to be maintained - if they can be now?</p>
<p>As for MJ history being world history, this is the statement of a meglomaniac or meglomaniac group.</p>
<p>Let me tell you folks, when I lived in Slovenia in 1998, MJ couldn&rsquo;t sell enough tickets to hold his first show there.  Promoters threatened he would never come again if people didn&rsquo;t buy tickets.  Somehow, no one cared.  No, MJ is not world history or even a world figure. He is a pop figure, and less of a cultural impact than The Beatles, or even Johnny Cash, or Bob Dylan, who did sell out a concert in Slovenia.  If anyone here wants to see what impact The Beatles had in the Soviet Union and how it brought about Glastnost and the fall, there are several documentaries on it, including the McCartney in Moscow video.  Now that is world history.  Most parents thought The Beatles were commies, but in Russia they represented freedom and could not be suppressed.  How ironic, but at least they did really earn those MBEs.  </p>
<p>The Neverland Park idea is simply an attempt by the owners to off a piece of difficult real estate on the California taxpayer.  Hopefully, they still have some sense there.</p>

<p>Someone please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but isn&rsquo;t California supposed to be broke?  <br>
They&rsquo;re curtailing bus service, closing hospitals, emptying jails&hellip;.  but they have 100 million for a Michael Jackson commemorative park?!!!</p>

<p>Another good point!  But it seems that where money is involved,  big money, any  former slights  can be forgiven. Money talks!</p>
<p>I also think Whiteplight put it very well:   &#8220;As for MJ history being world history, this is the statement of a meglomaniac.&#8221;   </p>

		<p>Michael Jackson&hellip;what comes to my mind?<br>
A &#8216;black man&rsquo; that went to all sorts of lenghts to look white;<br>
A drug-addict;<br>
A &#8216;person&rsquo; with multiple serious child-abuse allegations hanging over his head like a black cloud;<br>
My opinion of his silly pop-music and dancing is by-the-by, but the fact is as far as I can see, he could be summed up as a non-person. If I was black, I wouldn&rsquo;t have a bar of him!<br>

<p>You are right, the Jackson family could have ran it just like the King family ran the King Center</p>
<p>Government May Take Over King Center</p>
<p>&#8220;A Park Service report issued last year revealed that the King Center then needed an estimated $11.6 million in repairs. The report cited leakage in the reflective pool on which King&rsquo;s tomb lies, collapsed drainage pipes and problems with loose and exposed wiring throughout the property.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Very few blacks will publicly criticize a fellow black, even when that person is widely regarded, despite aquittal of charges, to be a child molester.  The black can date only non-blacks, straighten his hair, wear green contacts, and bleach his skin  &mdash;  but he&rsquo;s still one of them.  It&rsquo;s as though blacks expect other blacks to want to be white and have a white mate.  I once read that OJ said &#8220;I don&rsquo;t shovel coal&#8221;, meaning he didn&rsquo;t go with black women, and he was notorious for his socializing with a mainly non-black crowd.  <br>
Leave running Neverland to blacks, and the whole deal with soon go under.</p>

<p>Obviously this would be an absurd and inappropriate use of tax dollars   &mdash;   even in a state that WASN&rsquo;T officially flat-broke. But given the Bronze State&rsquo;s (mostly Mexican-related) current economic woes, a proposal such as this shouldn&rsquo;t see the light of day anywhere but in satirical publications and websites. </p>
<p>&#8220;California history&#8221;? Michael Jackson only moved to CA after he got rich and famous   &mdash;   just like every entertainer of every ethnicity does when they hit the big time. MJ and the rest of his family are from the city-sized ghetto known as Gary, IN. Should the state of Indiana buy up every property in Gary and sanctify the joint to State Park status too? </p>
<p>Makes about as much sense as what this lunatic Alice Huffman is proposing. </p>
<p>Time we started enforcing &#8220;the Separation of State and Showbiz.&#8221; </p>

		<p>The reason for this, is that Neverland is a money pit that not even Jackson himself, at the height of his fame could afford. The land should be bulldozed and divvied up and sold. Politically connected blacks don&rsquo;t find this acceptable however and blacks must never be displeased. The broke state of Ca. now will have this (forgive the term) white elephant foisted upon it. </p>
<p>The most telling part of the article is that the pres. of the state naacp is also on the parks commission. Conflict of interest anyone? </p>

<p><br>
There is a lot of truth in that. <br>
In the Middle Ages, society was centered around the church.  It set the attitudes, opinions, styles and standards.  <br>
In modern times, the formerly-great influence of the Church has largely been replaced by Showbiz. Now it&rsquo;s celebrities, not churchmen, who set the styes and standards. </p>

		<p>I think it a good idea simply because California is totally broke and upside down this year to the tune of forty billion. </p>
<p>Allegedly California is the state with the most millionaires but with the stock market hitting the mat their wealth has been diminished considerably. Arnold needs money. As I&rsquo;ve said before liberalism and racial toleration will only work [and only then to a limited degree] in thriving economies. California now has to deal with the dead weight of an over abundance of blacks and Hispanics. </p>
<p>Furthermore there will be no bailouts from Washington either. This country is rapidly becoming broke. China has downgraded our country from being AAA, and it owns about 2.5 trillion of our dollars.</p>
<p>In Europe and especially Asia,  Michael Jackson is idolized. Did he have issues? Could James Brown do the James Brown? Duh? Will the park be successful? Yes! Will it make a lot of money for California? Yes. Will it still be making money in ten years? Yes. Is it a good investment? Yes.       </p>
<p>In retrospect, Michael probably should have checked out right after his Thriller album. The cut and video Billie Jean, in my opinion at least, was great in every respect. </p>
<p>I still remember the night long ago when Billie Jean had just hit and I had walked into a place called Custer&rsquo;s Terrace in Columbus Georgia right when the D.J. was putting the song on. I did Michael&rsquo;s complete dance routine to the song, on the floor alone, and turned around and left. As I was walking out the door I heard the D.J. intone. That&rsquo;s the way it is. He runs you all to death during the day and then out dances you all at night!</p>
