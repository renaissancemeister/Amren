<h1>Victim in Latest Alleged S.I. Bias Attack Speaks Out</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Malvasio, New York One, July 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As police on Staten Island continue to investigate a string of bias attacks in Port Richmond, the latest victim is speaking out exclusively to NY1.</p>
<p>The 40-year-old Mexican man says he was attacked Friday night after walking home from Faber Park.</p>
<p>He says he was beaten by five men who yelled anti-Mexican comments and made off with his backpack.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The victim, who has lived in the country for more than five years, says he does remember bits and pieces of the moments leading up to the attack. He says he had just finished up a soccer match at the park and was simply heading home when he was approached by a group of young black men.</p>
<p>He says the attack was part of a pattern that needs to be stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came here to work and they are always waiting for the moment when we are a little bit drunk or when we get off to work to assault us,&#8221; said the victim.</p>
<p>This is at least the sixth violent incident that has taken place in the neighborhood since April, and community leaders are urging residents to remain alert.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police say they are looking for five suspects in this latest case, which is being investigated as a hate crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There is also a phone number for the Mexican consulate that is being handed out to immigrants who may otherwise be concerned about speaking directly to authorities. That number is 1-800-724-7264.<br>

		<p>Just &#8220;a little bit drunk&#8221;&hellip;..?  Perhaps public drunkeness is not a good idea when in someome ELSE&rsquo;S country!  I would certianly advise white college students to not party hardy in Mexico.  Seems sensible to me.</p>

		<p>I guess you have to be Mexican to have the media report blacks as &#8220;MEN&#8221; who can have hate as a motive.If he was White they would have called the perps small children and the motive would be robbery since they borrowed his backpack.</p>

		<p>Notice how it is being investigated as a hate crime, if the victim were white, this would not have been the case.A lot of hispanics think that blacks will not bother them because they are &#8220;people of color&#8221;, they are learning the hard way that that is not true. </p>

		<p>Staten Island New York is the borough that many Whites - especially Italians from Brooklyn - have &#8220;fled&#8221; to to escape multiculturalism.  There are pockets of Blacks and Hispanics in Port Richmond.  Blacks and Hispanics historically don&rsquo;t &#8220;get along&#8221;, and I&rsquo;m being mild about it.  Eventually Staten Island may be a location that the Whites from Brooklyn will flee.  For now it&rsquo;s not bad.  The problem is commuting into the city (meaning Manhattan).  The ferry is located in a neighborhood that is &#8220;going down&#8221;. (i.e. Black neighborhood) On a related note, Blacks are being pushed out of the city by Indians (from India), Orientals and others.  Harlem, incredibly, is becoming less Black, but very slowly.  Blacks have hostility toward all these groups and the reason is because they see them succeeding where they have failed.  They can&rsquo;t accept their own failure(&rsquo;s) so naturally they blame - of course - the evil White man.  They can&rsquo;t publicly blame any of the other groups so we - Whites become the scapegoat in the media.  They will attack Mexicans in the street however, like they will attack us.  Of course that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;re &#8220;racist&#8221; of course.  Only Whites can be &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>

		<p>This has actually been going on for several years now. Predictably, the NY media have gone out of their way to play down the race issue, or quite often, obviously attempt to hide the identity of the perps altogether. </p>
<p>Gee, apparently there is trouble in &#8220;Diversity-land!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Of course the two or three Mexicans who shot four college  bound black teens in the back of the head one summer were NOT engaging in a bias attack and it was not deemed so in the news.  I wonder how the blacks feel about being displaced by illegal hispanics, and about hispanics using the black game plan of crying &#8220;race bias&#8221; against them?  Fine by me.  It&rsquo;s time the tables were turned on the blacks.  High time.  Apparently the blacks don&rsquo;t LIKE it though, hence &#8220;act out&#8221; when they see one on the street.  Point is, clearly the media is swinging in favor of the NEW entitled ethnic group.</p>

		<p>Mexican illegals are known to keep payday money in their pockets, so it&rsquo;s no wonder criminals target them.  </p>

		<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t care how many ILLEGAL ALIEN invaders the blacks beat, rob, rape and murder since no one seems to care how many Whites are beaten, robbed, raped and murdered by ILLEGAL ALIEN invaders and blacks! Tired of hearing &ldquo;We came here to work&#8221; nonsense since close investigation would likely reveal that all of the participants in this attack are on welfare and section 8 housing..</p>

		<p>If the perps had been white, their race would have been babbled about endlessly with calls to stop &#8220;white Supremacism.&#8221;  But, since they are black, that isn&rsquo;t even mentioned.</p>
<p>To be able to assist authorities in identifying the perps, a description of each one would be absolutely necessary, but that isn&rsquo;t given because they&rsquo;re black.</p>
<p>Because of the anti-white, pro-non-white sentiment displayed constantly in this country, I wouldn&rsquo;t call them to report anything even if I sat in my vehicle watching everything take place.</p>
<p>Let the blacks and mestizos fight it out.  Both groups are trying to destroy whites.</p>

It&rsquo;s just ashamed that it only applies when they assault hispanics and not whites.</p>

		<p>Hilarious!</p>
<p>Mexicans are patrolling US streets, because a few Mexes were beaten, yet there have been 20,000 people killed on the streets of Mexico since 2006 by drug gangs and other criminals.</p>
<p>These eggheads have got to be the laughing stock of the world.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if they&rsquo;re patrolling US streets when the cartels take control of the country from the federal government.</p>
<p>The overall situation might easily be exacerbated by a blogger reporting on these black on Hispanic attacks around California and cause the intensity of the race riots between blacks and mestizos that occur with great frequency to increase even more. Both groups are too dimwitted to act on their own original thoughts, mostly because they don&rsquo;t have any.  </p>

		<p>#6, They weren&rsquo;t Mexicans.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/05/jury_hears_defendants_intervie.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/05/jury_hears_defendants_intervie.html</a></p>
<p>There was yelling and the victims were told to get on the floor. &#8220;One homeboy grab one dude from the car. Bring him down the steps then bring another one. Then a girl. Then one homeboy from Salvador came with a machete. Started to hit her. Shooting from the head all three of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hightower, Harvey and Terrance Aeriel were all lined up against a wall and shot in the back of the head. Hightower was attacked with a machete, as was Natasha Aeriel.</p>
<p>Godinez gave his statement in English, which was imperfect but understandable. Throughout the nearly three-week-long trial, he has followed the proceedings with a Spanish translator, through headphones.</p>
<p>Much of what Godinez said about the attacks matches Natasha Aeriel&rsquo;s account, however other portions of the statement have not been substantiated by authorities or contradict what they said they know. For example, Godinez said he was born in the United States, though he emigrated from Nicaragua when he was 5. He said his half-brother, Alexander Alfaro, wasn&rsquo;t involved in the killings, though he is one of the six people who have been charged. And he said the Aug. 4 attacks were payback  &mdash;  a year in the planning  &mdash;  after one of the victims killed a friend of another defendant in the case. Godinez&rsquo;s attorney and prosecutors have said there is no evidence to that effect.</p>
<p>He also described his affiliation with the Central American gang MS-13, where he was a member since he was 13 years old. Prosecutors said the killing was gang-related, and Godinez gave the impression that one of the defendants  &mdash;  whom he referred to as Shaka, but is actually Jose Carranza  &mdash;  may have been tryng to earn status within the gang. &#8220;They called me. Wanted to see what kind of heart Shaka had,&#8221; he said.<br>
