<h1><a href="http://alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LDE66T0QF.htm">Strip Criminals of French Nationality  &mdash;  Sarkozy</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alternet, July 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Friday he wanted to strip French nationality from anyone of foreign origin who threatened the life of a police officer, in a crackdown after riots shook two French towns this month.</p>
<p>Speaking in Grenoble, where street violence erupted in mid-July after a local man died fleeing police after allegedly holding up a casino, Sarkozy said he also wanted to increase prison sentences for violent crimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;French nationality should be stripped from anybody who has threatened the life of a police officer or anybody involved in public policing,&#8221; Sarkozy said.</p>
<p>Police in the Grenoble area have received death threats since the riots.</p>

		<p>It is good on Sarkozy for a strong response. War doesn&rsquo;t respect boundaries.</p>
<p>During the Northern Ireland conflict, police, soldiers and members of the justice and political structure had to take preventive measures to hide their identities, because of the real danger they and their family could be hunted in their homes. </p>
<p>France is dealing with a nascent immigrant insurgency, with a very dangerous adversary who scorns a soft touch.</p>

<p>Why only for threatening the life of French police?  How about the ones who threaten the lives of native French people?</p>
<p>This guy talks tough, which is good as far as it goes   &mdash;   but that&rsquo;s not very far.  Only action to match the rhetoric is going to impress me.</p>

<p>Well, these &#8220;youths&#8221; who are rioting every night and burning on average a hundred cars will accelerate their activity as the European economy continues to fall, because their freebies and other social benefits are destined to be cut as the European economy continues to deteriorate.  Their answer to that will be uncontrolled rioting, which will eventually evolve to armed insuurection.</p>
<p>They will receive arms from outside the country or they will take over armories and police stations to get the firepower they need.  And, this is not good news for white French citizens, because, unlike the US, they don&rsquo;t have but a handful of arms in the entire population.  They&rsquo;ll be at the mercy of the blacks and Arabs.</p>
<p>France could actually fall to its immigrant insurgents.  If they do, I wonder if they&rsquo;ll continue to tell the world that diversity is their strength?</p>

		<p>This is a big change for the French. Why? Even for the most stupid French, it&rsquo;s becoming ever clearer that they are a shrinking percentage of their own country. Expect increasingly &#8220;xenophobic&#8221; pronouncements from French politicians  &mdash;  soon even Le Pen will begin to look like a centrist!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never trusted Sarkozy. I don&rsquo;t think it was wise of France to elect a president who&rsquo;s not particularly French. This guy has been office for a long time and he&rsquo;s just not getting to this? I&rsquo;m thinking he&rsquo;s just a French version of John McCain. Although I am glad to see he&rsquo;s making such an overture. It shows which way the political winds are blowing.</p>

		<p>This is a good argument against citizenship laws which are based solely on birthplace. When a child receives the citizenship of a country in which his parents don&rsquo;t really come from, there&rsquo;s a good chance that the child also won&rsquo;t adopt the culture of that country. At the same time, he&rsquo;ll be too separated from the parents&rsquo; culture to fit in there, and as a non-citizen, might not even have the right to live in the parents&rsquo; country of origin. As a result, countries which give citizenship to anybody who&rsquo;s born there often find themselves with large numbers of troublemakers from abroad who can&rsquo;t be deported.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>I agree. He has always been for immigration, assimilation, miscegenation. He&rsquo;s made no secret of it. </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s only against immigrants who riot, kill policemen, and make an awkward public-relations situation for the government.  He&rsquo;d prefer the race change to go smoothly, quietly, and without attracting public attention. These &#8220;youths&#8221; are creating a problem because they&rsquo;re drawing attention and are likely to win votes and sympathy for the French right.  Can&rsquo;t have that! Hence, the tough talk.</p>

		<p>Although I&rsquo;m not overly impressed with Sarkozy, he at least is (and has been) making noises that, while not leading to serious action against the African and Middle Eastern hostile invaders, are at least different in interesting ways from those made by most self-styled Conservatives on this side of the Atlantic. It is imperative that the US drop it&rsquo;s attitude of viewing immigrants as belonging to &#8216;communities&rsquo; with their own legitimate public subcultures here. Not only should we return to pre-1965 type national preferences for legal immigration, but we should make permanent residency, and even eventual citizenship, revokable in case the person&rsquo;s later conduct reveals incompatibility with our core values (which, needless to say, I would not allow liberals to define). I would further grant a naturalized citizen (even one in good standing) less privileges and rights than a native one, and make even those kick in slowly. The right to vote would be the very last privilege to be conferred, and a US-born person&rsquo;s degree of citizenship would depend on various factors. Would-be immigrants would be required to first demonstrate dedication to our founding principles and knowledge of our history. European immigrants (or those from European-founded nations) would not be able to benefit from their birth-nations&rsquo; preferred status unless they really were from that country&rsquo;s stock (there are various means of ascertaining that, what with today&rsquo;s computerized genealogy tools). Such a &#8216;directed&rsquo; program of sponsored European immigration, could help us reverse anti-White demographic trends (though perhaps exacerbate them elsewhere   &mdash;   but resolving THAT is other countries&rsquo; responsibility). Also, strict enforcement of immigration laws (via fence, high-tech border surveillance, AZ-style local and state laws and employer crackdowns), coupled with restoration of traditional American values in our schools and colleges, would cause many trouble-makers of dubious allegiences (whether here legally or not) to self-deport. Ideally, those hardcore White liberals unwilling to give up on their accustomed West-bashing treasonous ways, will show some backbone and consistency and immigrate to those wondrous third-world countries they profess to be so enamored of. </p>

		<p>Sarkozy is a fraud, but this would be a good law.  It&rsquo;s essentially involuntary repatriation for a subset of non-whites. </p>
<p>Remember that the president of France only talks like this because the FN is breathing down his neck.  Nationalists can have a positive influence even when they lose.  We need to start getting organized politically in America and start contesting elections.  </p>

		<p>Reminds me of a BNP policy of removing British citizenship for any immigrant who commits a crime in the United Kingdom. It would be a good way of sifting out the more violent Muslims,  and all those black immigrants whose occupation is going out and committing misdemeanors all day.</p>

France was very foolish to allow nonwhite people to immigrate to the country.<br>
That is the nature of Socialist Totalitarianism as the national mindset.<br>
The most obvious problem is that the French government is knowingly allowing blacks to immigrate despite the fact that racism is universal and worse in the non-European world.<br>
The French government has turned into an anti-french entity.<br>
The other big problem is that the French are largely uneducated about race and assume that the riots only happen when a group of French wish to be dominant and make the blacks subordinant despite the fact that ethnic conflict is universal.<br>
The French even assume that their ethnic conflicts will work themselves out as they work toward an unranked system.<br>
But the ugly truth is that the blacks covet control over society to ensure their dominance over the French people.<br>
The muslims view the french as a rival group in terms of obtaining benefits and will not stop jockeying for control until a moratorium is placed on immigration and they are deported until gone.</p>

That is a very good observation. You can make a big  difference, even if you don&rsquo;t win an election, just by being in the picture. You can force your opposition to co-opt your platform and policies, in order to defeat you. </p>
<p>I remember reading the remark, somewhere, that the Communist Party of America never won an election, nor even came close, but nonetheless, <b>most of their agenda has  come into being,</b> little by little, even though they were perceived as losers and irrelevant.  In fact, they were VERY relevant! </p>

		<p>You will soon be hearing most European leaders talking this way.</p>
<p>The reason is white nationalism is sweeping Russia and eastern Europe and has spread to western europe to the point that the current multiculturist governments are on the cusp of illegitimacy.  They do not reflect what most whites in these countries want.  To be blunt, Sarkozy is worried about being overthrown by militants who then deal with blacks, Muslims and gypsies with armed militias that round them up and either mass deport them or simply dispose of them (along with Sarkozy and his government).</p>
<p>The real trouble will start if Putin embraces white nationalism.  He could EASILY rebuild the old soviet empire, not by force, but by consent, if he did this.  A huge chunk of the white population all over Europe, would join with him.  They would demand pro-white governments.</p>
<p>This would also spread to the US.</p>
<p>Words, however, are not enough.  Sooner or later, Sarkozy will have to act on them.  ALL western governments will be under increasing pressure to act against non-whites.</p>
<p>Times are far different today then they were, say, under Enoch Powell.  Race problems aren&rsquo;t theoretical anymore.  Most cities in every white nation have literally been destroyed by non-whites.  Photos of Detroit look much like photos of Hiroshima after the bombing.  The difference is, of course, that Hiroshima recovered to become a vibrant city.  Detroit is unlikely to make such a recovery&hellip;.unless blacks are removed from both the city and the nation.</p>

<p> I agree that the ill-tempered dwarf Sarkozy is down in the political polls and is looking to gain public traction. He can&rsquo;t be trusted. Nevertheless, I support his idea of stripping all foreign born felons of French citizenship. I would support this proposal even if it had been suggested by leftist flake Ségolène Royal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to believe you, as your comment is very encouraging, but call me skeptical.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t Putin, and by extension the clique currently in power in Moscow, very much in bed with the &#8220;Russian&#8221; mafia?  What I read says so.  And the &#8220;Russian&#8221; mafia are the opposite of &#8220;white nationalist&#8221; AFAICT.  AFAICT, the &#8220;Russian&#8221; mafia&rsquo;s interests are diametrically opposed to those of white nationalism.</p>
<p>I do see the stirrings of ethnonationalism (seems to be lots of cooperation between &#8220;fascist&#8221; state forces and &#8220;fascist&#8221; grass-roots in Russia) in Russia, but so much of Russian power is in the hands of the &#8220;Russian&#8221; mafia that I&rsquo;m skeptical of how far ethnonationalism will go in Russia.  The optimistic interpretation is that Putin&rsquo;s faction is pro-Russian, and they are aligned with an actually Russian faction of the Russian mafia, and the &#8220;Russian&#8221; mafia is out in the cold doing their thing on their own, but as I said, that seems optimistic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad, how little good information comes to us out of Russia.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad that finally President Sarkosky has come up with the idea of removing the French Citizenship of non-White criminals. Very Good. All the White Nations should follow this proposal.</p>
<p>I would add that those stripped of Citizenship should not be allowed to remain in France or in Europe and should be deported to the Countries or territories of approximate origin.</p>
