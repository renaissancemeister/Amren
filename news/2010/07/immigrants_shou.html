<h1>Immigrants &#8216;Should Get Half Minimum Wage&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alex Rossi, Sky News (UK), July 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A bitter row has broken out in Denmark after a politician suggested the country&rsquo;s immigrants should be paid only half the minimum wage.</p>
<p>Karsten Lauritzen, the immigration spokesman for the ruling right liberal party Venestre, wants migrants to receive just 50 kroner (£5.60) an hour instead of the 100 kroner (£11.20) that native Danes pocket.</p>
<p>He claims it is in the immigrants&rsquo; interest to accept the lower pay, arguing that higher wages are stopping immigrants getting work at all.</p>
<p>By capping pay, he says, a two-tier system could evolve which would enable immigrants to get a foothold on the jobs ladder.</p>
<p>&#8220;The high minimum wage is a barrier to get immigrants into work. So if we want to get the immigrants out of the ghettos we will have to pay less,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The idea has been received favourably in some quarters but is also highly divisive.</p>
<p>Within Venestre the proposal is causing ructions, on the grounds that it is discriminatory.</p>
<p>Immigration Minister Birthe Ronn Hornbech has clashed very publicly with Mr Lauritzen over the matter, even though he is the department&rsquo;s spokesman.</p>
<p>Ms Hornbech says the idea is at odds with national policy because the Danish government has a duty to treat everyone equally.</p>
<p>She went on to call the proposal &#8216;&#8220;disagreeable&#8221; and said it stigmatised immigrants and sent the message to the wider society that they were worth less.</p>
<p>There are nearly half a million immigrants in Denmark  &mdash;  many of them are asylum seekers from conflict zones.</p>
<p>Many educated Iraqis for instance  &mdash;  including doctors, scientists and engineers  &mdash;  are currently jobless despite being well skilled.</p>
<p>Immigration is an extremely volatile issue in Denmark.</p>
<p>In 2006 a Danish newspaper published a caricature of the prophet Muhammad  &mdash;  the image sparked protests and riots around the world.</p>

		<p>Absolutely not! This is exactly the problem&hellip;.when immigrants (legal or illegal) are allowed to work for LESS than the wages that would be paid to a citizen, there is little reason to hire the citizen. </p>
<p>A better approach would be to require immigrants to be paid DOUBLE the minimum wages of a citizen in the same position.</p>
<p>Yeah, we can be unreasonable too.</p>

		<p>Of course what will happen is that so many Danish employers will do whatever they can to hire as many half-wage immigrants as they can and as few native born (white) Danes as possible.  What they should do is raise the minimum wage for immigrants to be higher than the same for whites, to keep them priced out of the labor market.</p>
<p>This is why the only real liberty I would give to illegal aliens in the United States is to let them join labor unions.  That way, they&rsquo;ll price themselves out of the labor market, and paradoxically undo the raison d&rsquo;etre the ruling class allowed them into the country to begin with (or at least part of the reason), to be cheap labor.</p>

<p>Then they should be in Iraq, Syria or Jordan. Denmark isn&rsquo;t anywhere near their homeland.  </p>
<p>If they won&rsquo;t voluntarily repatriate, then start paying them less and begin reducing services.  &#8216;Incentives&rsquo; to leave Europe are what they need. </p>

		<p>What about not paying them anything to begin with, including welfare&hellip; Then they wouldn&rsquo;t come to the West to begin with.</p>
<p>Problem solved.</p>

		<p>No way. My first thought instantly was that this would only make them MORE ATTRACTIVE to employers, who would hire immigrants rather than natives.</p>
<p>In Sweden, in fact, the rate of immigration has been kept down (from what the government would like it to be) by the firm insistance of Swedish unions that immigrants be paid at standard union scale. If employers have a choice between hiring a Somali at standard wage or a Swede, they&rsquo;ll take the Swede.</p>

		<p>This will insure that native Danes will be put out of work just as native Americans have been put out of work by illegals.</p>

		<p>What do the Danes want?  Do they even have a voice?  Do they get honest reporting of the crime rates and longterm welfare dependency?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that they want these &#8216;poor refugee/immigrants&rsquo; at all.  I think that if you gave them a chance, they would show every single one of them the door.</p>
<p>And that is why the debate is about how to make these people worthwhile as contributors to a society which ostracizes them because they are _not wanted_.</p>
<p>Until and unless we deal with mass ponzi scheme that is &#8216;growth&rsquo; capitalism by doing the same types of things that the Japanese are doing (outsourcing cheap manufacturing, restructuring retail, retraining females, keeping the elderly on longer, at part time, without tax penalty AND GOING TO ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION WHEREEVER POSSIBLE) we will become an island populace in our own homelands and bowling-alone conditions will make lead to mass Balkanization.</p>
