			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Latanya Fanion, Atlanta Examiner, July 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Since the inception of special education in 1975, advocates have been fighting for the fair and equal treatment of students with disabilities. While some wanted these students to receive an educational experience that was comparable to their non-disabled peers, others, such as Lloyd Dunn, wanted to ensure that all students with disabilities: were treated equitably; received disability labels that were non-discriminatory; and were educated in general education versus special education classrooms- a placement where the curriculum was often described as substandard and incapable prepping students for any creditable post-secondary opportunity.</p>
<p>Dunn advocated for these three initiatives because they were all at the foundation of a silent epidemic that was festering in special education programs all across the county- African American students, especially those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, were being disproportionately labeled as having emotional and behavior disorders and mental retardation. The rate at which these students were placed in these two categories outnumbered all other racial groups. In addition to being mislabeled, once placed in special education, many of these students were more likely to receive their instruction in special education classes away from their non-disabled peers. Dunn advocated for the fair treatment of minorities in special education a few years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that &#8220;separate was inherently unequal&#8221; in Brown vs. Topeka Board of Education (1954)- the landmark case that ended segregation in the nation&rsquo;s public schools.</p>
<p>Since that time, the disproportionate number of African American students being labeled with emotional and behavior disorders and intellectual disabilities has remained unchanged. According to data from the 2009-2010 annual special education report compiled by the Georgia Department of Education, African American students continue to outnumber other subgroups of students in the categories of Emotional Behavioral Disorders (EBD) and Intellectual Disabilities. Additionally, African American students are more likely to be served in special education classes and residential placements more than their peers. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The special education annual report also indicated that African American students accounted for 39 percent of the total special education population. However, they made up 47 percent of the students labeled as having emotional and behavior disorders and 57 percent of students with intellectual disabilities. These data show that African American students were disproportionately represented in these two areas. Hence, when compared to their presence in the overall population of students with disabilities, African American students were overrepresented in each of the specific populations of interest  &mdash;  students identified with emotional and behavioral disorders and intellectual disabilities. Despite these numbers, the proportionality of these students is not considered at-risk by the Georgia Department of Education until a 2.0 weighted risk ratio is reached.</p>
<p>When analyzing the racial representation by setting, the data demonstrates that African American students are more likely to receive their instruction in a special education classroom away from their non-disabled peers. They were more likely to be served in the general education classroom less than 40 percent of the school day, and least likely to be served in the general education classroom for more than 80 percent of the school day.</p>

<p>Not once does it occur to Latanya that this might not be &#8220;disproportionate labeling&#8221; at all.  Listen to me, Latanya: &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; as a group <i>do</i> display a disproportionate percentage of emotional and behavioral disorders and mental retardation. That this is true does not imply any Evil White Racist &#8220;labeling,&#8221; it simply reveals an uncomfortable truth that you are unwilling to face.</p>
<p>And the rest of us are growing increasingly less willing to live in your convoluted fantasy world.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re aren&rsquo;t being &#8216;mislabeled&rsquo;. They&rsquo;re being disproportionately labeled because they are disproportionately borderline retarded. I have no doubt that teachers actually use restraint and would like to see more of these students labeled special need.</p>
<p>This is one of those &#8216;be careful what you wish for&rsquo;. These people pushed for special programs and they got them. Now they don&rsquo;t like the results.</p>
<p>Again, damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t. When it comes to blacks, you can&rsquo;t win or break even.<br>

		<p>It is of no great surprise to me that most of the blacks in special education are &#8220;low income&#8221; Most whites in special education classes are likewise low income. Since schools get far more tax money for &#8220;disabled&#8221; students than general education or gifted students the race is on for as many kids as possible to be labeled as special education. When the whole trend of special education started in the 70&rsquo;s there was a selective private school that was promised money for a special education program, immediately about a quarter of the kids- who had to test in the top 25th percentile of the country for admittance- were labeled as learning disabled. Black parents of low income also want to get their kid labeled as special needs to get what they laughingly call &#8220;crazy money&#8221; it is just another welfare payment. The White parents of low income do not have the means to have their kids tested for mental or emotional problems and since they are too busy just making ends meet. They may also be of low intelligence so therefore more likely to go along with whatever the teachers want. Special education is mostly a racket and if your child is recommended for such then get them independently tested instead of relying on school counselors or teachers who may only be seeing the bottom line. </p>

		<p>Blacks are so inept, generally, and lacking in so many qualities other races take for granted, they&rsquo;re a burden on whatever society they happen to occupy, including Africa.  </p>
<p>Trouble, turmoil, chaos and violence are what they bring with them wherever they go.</p>
<p>All societies that have large poulations of blacks are destined to break up into racial enclaves.  There is a point at which the problems they cause and the caretaking they require are so burdensome society at some point will not be able to continue without collapsing or erupting into violence.</p>
<p>With an economic disaster unfolding throughout the West, that point is fast approaching.  Will it be voluntary separation or civil war?</p>

		<p>Back in the early 1970&rsquo;s, before the federal government mandated Special Ed, I would imagine that each state or school district would create its own standards for dealing with these students. At my elementary school, there were about 350 - 400 students in grades 1 - 6. Prior to this ruling there was one classroom set aside for what we would now called Special Ed. There were about 25 students of which one was white. This poor white student who was a female probably had an IQ of about 75. She lived a few blocks away and was such a dullard that it just wasn&rsquo;t considered cool to pick on her. Owing to the nature and demographics of the school district I attended, she may well have been the only or one of a very few white students in her class every year. </p>
<p>Since blacks mature faster, I wonder if this skews against those who should probably be put into these programs (or should just allowed to drop out after the 7th grade). What would happen if the schools were allowed to give annual IQ tests to all students so that progress could be tracked. It would certainly make it a lot harder to throw endless amounts of money trying to turn future field hands into neurosurgeons. </p>

		<p>I worked in a school in the Bronx that was 70% Latino, 29% black and 1% white.  (The 1% was actually one white trash kid who was a convert to hip hop culture.)</p>
<p>Listen, half the latino kids were straight up gangbangers, the other half were really nice.  The dichotomy was really rather fascinating to many of us teachers who wondered how it was an either/or kind of situation.</p>
<p>The black kids though - they were all at some level of craziness.  There was not one &#8216;normal&rsquo; one among &#8216;em.  There were a few that were near to being okay, by traditional American standards, but even they, at the drop of a hat, could start punching someone, throwing a chair, running around like a maniac, etc.  </p>
<p>Can you image how the rest were?  At our school we happened to not have any special ed support, so the inmates were running the asylum.  </p>
<p>I do agree that a lot of black kids are being labelled special ed that are not really physically retarded in their mental capacities, but in a system where severe EMOTIONAL and BEHAVIORAL problems cannot be adequately addressed, it is so much easier to just label them &#8216;sped&rsquo; and get them some kind of help.  In any case, they &#8216;mainstream&rsquo; all the &#8216;sped&rsquo; kids into regular classes, calling it a social justice issue.</p>
<p>Do you know how hard it is to teach a class that is 50% normal kids with the normal range of differences, and then have the other 50% being crazy, emotionally unstable, special ed, criminal, 2-3 years over age, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>All the blame the teacher people need to realize that American education was fine before the social justice people said to mix the problems in with the mainstream kids.  All it did was ruin the educations of the better kids who now had to worry about getting jumped by gangbangers after school.  How can any teacher be successful?  (Freedom Writers is a myth pushed by those who want to bring about the final destruction of the American educational system, once the envy of the world.)</p>

		<p>You see it all the time here.  Blacks on the subway, buses, street panhandling, talking to themselves, on the edge of sanity.  </p>
<p>The Black psyche is not on the same level as the White psyche.  Today I was traveling on the subway and I noticed a Black man in about his mid 20&rsquo;s starting up a conversation with a young Black female walking with what appeared to be her son of about 3 years old.  I heard the conversation; they definitely did not know each other before that conversation.  After talking for less than 10 minutes this guy was playing with and picking up the boy - as if he were the father or another relative.  It was quite unbelievable to watch.  The Black woman didn&rsquo;t act as if anything was wrong with this.  Such a thing is absolutely inappropriate but neither the Black guy nor the Black woman seemed to understand this.   To think a woman would let a man she&rsquo;s known for 10 minutes or so handle her son like that.  She didn&rsquo;t appear to be retarded either. These were average Blacks.  This is the level that they function at.   Can we imagine the retarded ones?</p>

		<p>In this typical liberal-slanted article, the facts are presented, and then a conclusion is drawn that is the complete opposite of the obvious one.  Twenty percent of American blacks have IQ&rsquo;s of 70 or below and, without doubt, need some sort of special education.  The IQ number for mental retardation was once 75 and below, but because so many blacks would fit into that range, it was lowered to 70.  <br>
I wonder how many blacks today now attend schools that are all black or almost all black, due to de facto segregation.  And yet, at least half these students never graduate.  But most black leaders refuse to concede the real problem at issue and thus would never back a different curriculum.  Some have suggested resegregating for various reasons, but since the real problem remains so politically charged, few if any will state it and propose real solutions.  </p>

		<p>A friend of mine was the guidance counselor at a nearly all black elementary school for nearly 20 years. Late in her career she confided that many of the students at her school began the first grade with vocabularies of 20 words or less and many of those obscenities. These six year olds could break dance, throw gang signs, and curse the paint of the walls but they didn&rsquo;t know their own last names.</p>
<p>The most telling thing was the PTA. My son went to a predominately white school of about 500. On PTA night it was common for as many as 1200 people to be present: parents, children, grandparents. But at my friend&rsquo;s school there were never more than 30 and most of them teachers.</p>

		<p>Spartan24 hit the nail on the head. This is all a big racket. The schools don&rsquo;t want the black special ed gravy train to stop. They get far more money for these &#8220;students&#8221; than they do for mainstream or gifted students and the classes are really just thug daycare. Actually, I don&rsquo;t think that schools even have special ed classes anymore. There are so many of these &#8220;students&#8221; most districts have whole &#8220;alternative schools&#8221; for these special ed, retarded, and juvenile delinquent blacks that are nothing more than &#8220;day jails&#8221; Where the blacks go, often until they &#8220;age out&#8221; where they can get free breakfast and lunch on taxpayers&rsquo; dime.<br>
The black parents don&rsquo;t want this to stop because having little LaKeisha and Jon&rsquo;Tavious in special ed gets them an $800 &#8220;crazy check&#8221; from Social Security. They take them to some Marxist, ghetto doctor (paid for by medicaid; welfare) who will &#8220;diagnose&#8221; their children with some &#8220;disorder&#8221; i.e.  learning disability, antisocial personality disorder, oppositional defiance disorder or some other fancy &#8220;flavour du jour&#8221; euphemism for being a low IQ, violent criminal is a cash cow for the parent and the school district and these doctors. </p>
<p>I absolutely agree, 100% with having them labeled and separated from the normal, well behaved and gifted students. It just makes me sick that we are paying for it in so many ways, taking away from OUR children so we can support this violent underclass from the cradle to the grave.</p>

		<p>Clearly the answer to the problem is to label more White kids as retards and keep them back so that the suppressed African geniuses can rise to the point where they are CEOs, astronauts, and whatnot. </p>
<p>On a serious note, I wonder to what degree our society has been held back by the constant coddling of the lest capable? I wonder how far space travel would have advanced without wasting resources on the &#8216;war on poverty&rsquo;, affirmative action, and so on?</p>

		<p>I agree that these kids need to be separated from the intellegent and well behaved kids, no matter what color they might be. When I was in 8th grade (85-86) there was a class that was basically a holding pen for kids who really did not have the intellegence to do much more than about 6th grade level work. Since kids aged out of middle school at 15 and could drop out at 16 they were kept in this special classroom for most of the day with teachers who could have been more accurately called bouncers. As soon as they aged out, they were placed in the high school for the following school year. Obviously they were just slopping through their freshman year until they were old enough to drop out. This whole mess of labeling kids special education ruins the life of kids who are not truly troubled- they are labeled for life just as surely as they were tattooed with &#8220;retarted&#8221; on their forehead. </p>

		<p>I have a friend who is a special education teacher  &mdash;  and has been since the mid 1970s. </p>
<p>Over the years we have often discussed how liberals attempt to &#8220;mainstream&#8221; learning disabled students into regular classes. The end result is ALWAYS that the academic standards of these classes are necessarily reduced to accommodate the inclusion of those students who are ill-equipped to be there.</p>
<p>Political correctness doesn&rsquo;t help the learning disabled. It simply penalizes everyone else.</p>

		<p>I might have doubted the large numbers of blacks in special education until this weekend. The usual weekend of black slaughter/robbery/carjacking/drug stories in Atlanta this weekend was made a little more entertaining than average weekends due to two separate incidents involving two black females. One was named Lukemeia; the other was Chlamydia. I swear. It&rsquo;s obvious these Special Ed&rsquo;ers are reproducing.</p>

		<p>The real problem is judging African-Americans by European-American standards.  Blacks are not suited to the complexities of a white society.  They are out of place and simply can not cope.  All one need do is look at Africa and see how quickly they regress to a simpler, more promitive way of life.  The two groups have no business living together.  It is just as much as artificial arangement as dogs and cats living together.  In nature it wouldn&rsquo;t happen.</p>

		<p>I think most African Americans know this over representation of their children in these negative categories just reflects reality but they know that stupidly guilt ridden whites get very nervous about it and so they feign indignity as if some racial injustice were behind it all, hoping for special considerations, preferences, &amp; compensations from the white suckers. Same old never ending game.   </p>

		<p>My husband and I are sped teachers who have worked in several states and condidtions. The special ed classroom is (or should be) super-structured with behavior mod that works great for the &#8220;real deals&#8221; (retarded) and converts some of the &#8220;environmental kids&#8221; (ghetto). Inclusion is a mess.</p>
<p>The big problem, and the reason we&rsquo;ve had to leave many districts, is the groveling, ignorant liberals, usually administrators, who will not allow discipline for sped kids. They also insist on keeping them in your room, where the behavior kids (environmental) make it rough for the sweet &#8220;real deals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Often, Parents will be a huge problem, as well, Either they gripe if we lead their children into voc programs (My daughter&rsquo;s going to be a pediatrician!), or they say you&rsquo;re &#8220;picking on&#8221; the student.  <br>
 <br>
Admistrators often make our lives hell to the point where we must leave and go elsewhere. Often, they only allow &#8220;positive discipline,&#8221; meaning if the kid disrupts, let him stop working (&#8220;he&rsquo;s frustrated&#8221;) and take him out to play hoops for awhile (while the good kids keep working).</p>
<p>Another method administrators love is for the kids to work a set number of lessons and then take &#8220;time off&#8221; for the rest of the hour. It&rsquo;s a perfect recipie for chaos. Many sped teachers give up.</p>
<p>The Ozark kids, where we are now, by the way, are MUCH better thaqn the ghetto. Poor is not the problem; parental attitudes and lack of intelligence are. </p>
<p>&#8220;Fads come and go. Years ago, everyboy was learning disabled&hellip;then it was ADD&hellip;now they&rsquo;re all &#8220;autistic&#8221;   &mdash;   or have &#8220;conduct disorder&#8221; or &#8220;oppositional defiance disorder&#8221;   &mdash;   which means they&rsquo;re just plain ol&rsquo; badly-behaved kids with horrible parenting.</p>
<p>It IS a racket. I stay in for the actual retarded kids, who are mostly very sweet, whatever race they are.</p>

		<p>I agree- the &#8220;least restrictive enviroment&#8221; touted by the educational elites is horrible for everyone. The kids that need special education do not get training or help that would help them become productive members of society and the regular kids get subpar teaching. </p>

Out of curiosity I followed them one day to their class, and found that most were enrolled in classes designated as 0&hellip;, meaning that they were not really college level, which begins with 1 - as in &#8220;English 101&#8221; -, a backdoor form of &#8220;Special Ed.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;One was named Lukemeia; the other was Chlamydia. I swear. It&rsquo;s obvious these Special Ed&rsquo;ers are reproducing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Post a link to a newspaper article or admit you made this up.</p>

<p>a bit of hostility&hellip; however, it wasn&rsquo;t a newspaper article; it was on a local news show there. I happened to be in a doctor&rsquo;s waiting room, the tv on the wall was turned down low, and I was reading a magazine. I heard what I thought was one of those unbelievably &#8216;ethnic&rsquo; names and glanced up at the story. My vague knowledge of the story was the typical black on black typical weekend extra curricular activities (this particular one involved a gun) that is so common one could almost write the script for. The picture came up on screen of a youngish black female with the caption, &#8220;Victim&#8221; and the name &#8216;Lukemeia&rsquo; something. I shook my head, and they said something about the &#8220;victim&rsquo;s cousin&#8221; and they gave a name, &#8220;Chlamydia&#8221; (perhaps my spelling is wrong as that name was not displayed, but the pronunciation was the same).  At that point, I just shook my head again, looked back down to my magazine, and was called into the doctor&rsquo;s office. Absurd, yes. Made up, no. I&rsquo;m no liar. If you live around the Atlanta area, you shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised. If you don&rsquo;t, you have no idea.</p>

		<p>Nice story, but WONDERFUL comments! I feel America speaking here! We are all full of compassion for those less fortunate, but so very tired of catering to the racist guilt-mongering of blacks. God bless America!</p>
