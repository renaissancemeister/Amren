<h1><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/guest/25474/">Did Whites Flee the &#8216;Digital Ghetto&rsquo; of MySpace?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christopher Mims, Technology Review, July 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;We were talking about the social media practices of her classmates when I asked her why most of her friends were moving from MySpace to Facebook. Kat grew noticeably uncomfortable. She began simply, noting that &#8216;MySpace is just old now and it&rsquo;s boring.&rsquo; But then she paused, looked down at the table, and continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&rsquo;s not really racist, but I guess you could say that. I&rsquo;m not really into racism, but I think that MySpace now is more like ghetto or whatever.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>So begins the book chapter White Flight in Networked Publics  &mdash;  How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and Facebook (pdf) part of the forthcoming book Digital Race Anthology.</p>
<p>Danah Boyd, author of the chapter, stirred up controversy once before, in 2007, by noting that during the period beginning in 2006 when teens began to flock to Facebook, teens&rsquo; preference for either MySpace or Facebook appeared to fall along lines of race and class.</p>
<p>Subsequent statistical analyses of the characteristics of users of online social networks by researchers, marketers and bloggers, she notes in her latest work, backed up her claims that white and asian teens who belonged to higher socieconomic strata (and who aspired to college, with which Facebook at the time was associated) were attracted to Facebook, while latino, black and working-class teens tended to opt for MySpace. Boyd notes in her chapter:</p>
<p>&#8220;Analysts at two unnamed marketing research firms contacted me to say that they witnessed similar patterns with youth at a national level but they were unable to publicly discuss or publish their finding, but scholars and bloggers were more willing to share their findings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boyd&rsquo;s current work argues that MySpace took on many of the aspects of a &#8220;digital ghetto&#8221; in the minds of teens who used the site, leading to &#8220;white [and asian] flight&#8221; from the site, analogous to the white flight from the city to the suburbs that took place in the U.S. beginning in the 1960&rsquo;s. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boyd argues that MySpace&rsquo;s inability to deal with spammers added to the feeling of urban blight that overtook the site, leaving derelict profiles &#8220;covered in spam, a form of digital graffiti.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As MySpace failed to address these issues, spammers took over like street gangs.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boyd&rsquo;s conclusion is that online environments are merely &#8220;a reflection of everyday life,&#8221; and that online communities are immune to the techno-optimist belief that the internet eliminates the deep divisions between people in real life. As Boyd notes in her own responses to earlier critiques of her work, this is either a controversial or an obvious thesis  &mdash;  what do you think?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see why non-whites would be more tolerant of spam than whites, unless non-whites were the primary perpetrators. Spam is defined as &#8220;unsolicited COMMERCIAL messages.&#8221; Perhaps what is being characterized as &#8220;spam&#8221; here is just general boisterous and inappropriate (in the eyes of whites) behavior.</p>

A few years back, I worked with white college age students.</p>
<p>I asked them about myspace and facebook.</p>
<p>They had all been teens when myspace came out and it was their first social networking site. But as they moved on to college age, they all changed to facebook. None of them brought up race; it was the issue. The consensus seemed to be that myspace was for kids (as when they were young teens) and that facebook was for adults.</p>

		<p>True, and not new. I offer the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;For a brief period of time, MySpace was the site where everyone kept their profile and managed their friendships. But soon, the service began to attract fake profiles, the wrong kind of white people, and struggling musicians. In real world terms, these three developments would be equivalent to a check cashing store, a TGIFridays, and a housing project. All which strike fear in the hearts of white people.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Within a matter of months, MySpace had gone from a virtual utopia to Digital Detroit, where only minorities and indie bands remain.&#8221;</p>

		<p>MySpace is ghetto because the major record labels have taken it over a couple of years ago.  Naturally, they use it to push their hip-hop, rap, and pop-tart junk.  On the other hand, Facebook remains a music-unfriendly site, largely due to Zuckerberg and company having issues with record labels demanding too much money regarding posted music via Playlist, etc..  That&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t see a lot of &#8220;ghetto&#8221; advertising at Facebook, because there is nothing there for the music industry to control.<br/>

		<p>Well, the cat&rsquo;s outta the bag now. Stay tuned for the diversification of facebook.  just as block-busting in the &rsquo;60s- &rsquo;70s created the need for suburbs farther and farther from the cities, this article will create the need for a new social networking site. The computer savvy among us should seize the opportunity.  </p>

		<p>Being an old fogey, I know next to nothing about MySpace or Facebook.  But it sounds as though, like everywhere else in society, people are congregating according to class and ethnicity.  Those with ghetto tastes, whether black, Hispanic, or white wannabe, will not be welcomed by the majority.</p>

<p>Oh, great. Now look for Facebook to be targeted for the virtual version of Section 8.  Who thinks it won&rsquo;t become ghettoized very quickly, now that the word is out that Whites fled the nastiness of MySpace?</p>
<p>Blacks simply cannot tolerate White Humanity&rsquo;s pursuit of life, liberty, property, and happiness.</p>
<p>Happy Whites means that the Civil Rights struggle has much more work to do.  </p>
<p>Our nation&rsquo;s unfinished business it to make more Whites as miserable as possible.  How else can you interpret the outcomes of Civil Rights, Affirmative Action, and Diversity?<br/>

<p>I think this actually is the truth of the matter. I hated myspace as everyone would have a song on their profile that would play as you click on their page. If you didn&rsquo;t have your speakers turned off you would be assaulted with terrible music you never asked to listen to forcing to rapidly fumble about to turn off your computer&rsquo;s speakers. Blacks love noise. They hate quiet.</p>

		<p>@ 3) I think it&rsquo;s more likely they just didn&rsquo;t want to admit the real reasons they switched over to facebook.  As someone who made the switch from myspace to facebook as a teen and then later a young adult, the reason why me and all of my friends did it is actually quite simple and rather obvious.</p>
<p>To quote my much younger and much less &#8216;politically correct&rsquo; brother, &#8220;Myspace is N*****-Space.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, the reason why none of my friends are afraid to say this is probably because we&rsquo;re all &#8220;working class&#8221; whites.  The college kids likely just don&rsquo;t want to harm their future careers.  We (rather you regard it as fortunate or unfortunate)don&rsquo;t have that problem.</p>

		<p>  Whites have fled Myspace in droves because it is an anti-white ghetto.  If you have so much as an inkling of a pro-White stance your account will be immediately deleted. Yet non-white users are free to spout &#8220;Kill Whitey&#8221; and glorify the gang lifestyle with comments about drug dealing and usage, rape, armed assault, etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p> Anyone with a hint of intelligence has fled Myspace a long time ago.</p>

		<p>Oh yes,<br/>
Some people like Detroit some people like Kansas and some people move from Detroit to Kansas, totally normal life. Just never the other way isn&rsquo;t it?<br/>
This article is great for several reasons:<br/>
1) We see the segregation even by young people who should actually be totally brainwashed if we remind what they see on TV and in the school.<br/>
2) Segregation is even in modern technology there. That means &#8220;having conversations and contacts to people all around the world&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t seem to have the effects Liberals hoped they would have.<br/>
3) If more and more people push on facebook (and they will do that as certain as the sun will raise) we know the effects of blacks fallowing white areas is even true in virtual areas.</p>
<p>4) And this is maybe most important: It will be very interesting to see how young people who have not the Liberal utopias of the 60s  will deal with the feeling of having to flee from diversity. They will probably not have to live next to blacks to understand but will learn by Internet.<br/>
This has a great potential. I am student and often look closer of how other students think and speak. So I can say from first hand that the effects of the Internet are great. Young people who have many contacts to other races and religions do not lose their identity or come to the conclusion that we are all the same. The opposite happens: They see that the stereotypes seem to be true. And furthermore they see that others think the same way.</p>
<p>Young people who see especially black behavior, the loud strength, the lack of intelligence, the lack of grammar, the lack of just all we are talking about and Amren is talking about will probably wake up. <br/>
And young people who feel uncomfortable by being surrounded by black people, have to talk with black people and get an idea of how it is to be with black people -feeling uncomfortable although it is just virtual- will certainly not believe in diversity and will certainly not move to an area with many black people.</p>
<p>That is a very great new progress.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s obvious to anyone who looks at either site, what their demographics are.  Hardly news, except for the fact that some people are afraid to admit it.</p>
<p>The more obvious site that seems to not be mentioned is &#8220;Our Space&#8221;  which bills itself as a &#8220;urban&#8221; networking site.  Kind of like FUBU.  The For Us By Us clothes for blacks.  No problem to have a company for one race as long as it&rsquo;s not the White race.</p>

		<p>And of course, all the technology that FUBU uses to manufacture and distribute their products was invented by whitey. Of course that doesn&rsquo;t hurt their &#8220;black pride&#8221;. I guess they don&rsquo;t think about it much. They don&rsquo;t do much thinking in general.</p>
