<h1>Charges of Racism Are About Politics</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Hawkins, Human Events, July 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Racism among whites became almost universally unacceptable. People my age and younger [have] never had to reform or &#8220;give up our racist ways&#8221; because the overwhelming majority of us were never racist in the first place.</p>
<p>Although racism exists, it has been marginalized in American society. {snip}</p>
<p>Although this is a taboo subject that&rsquo;s seldom fully discussed in public, being black is often an advantage, not a disadvantage, when it comes to work or going to school. Talented black students have a much easier time getting into schools of their choice and getting scholarships than white students.</p>
<p>The government actually discriminates against white people in an effort to favor black workers. Businesses will often work harder to recruit talented black workers for diversity purposes and are more reluctant to fire black workers because they fear lawsuits. The advantages of being black in today&rsquo;s society are larger and more pervasive than the disadvantages black Americans face because of their race.</p>
<p>Yet, as the evidence of actual bigotry against black Americans has become more and more scarce, the cries of racism have gotten ever louder. People have been accused of racism over the last two years for voting for John McCain, disagreeing with Obama, opposing healthcare, going to Tea Parties, listening to Rush Limbaugh, being Republican, wanting to secure the border, working for Fox News  &mdash;  it goes on and on.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black Americans in this country have been voting for the Democratic Party, practically en masse for 40 years and they have very little to show for it. Moreover, black Americans tend to agree with Republicans on issues like abortion, illegal immigration, school choice, and gay marriage. So, how do the Democrats manage to hold 90% of the black vote when the Republican Party is a better fit for a large number of black voters?</p>
<p>{snip} The sad reality is that an average black man who agrees with the GOP on most of the issues and lives in a city the Democrats have run into the ground for decades will go to the polls and vote for a Democrat over a Republican because he&rsquo;s been told that Republican is racist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The people who get to be the ultimate authorities on what counts as racism have financial and political motives to see racism everywhere and to accuse Republicans of being the ones fermenting it.</p>
<p>The media, which is loaded with people like Spencer Ackerman, and the Democratic Party which is loaded with people like Mary Frances Berry, do everything they can to amplify the charges. It&rsquo;s a good way to change the subject, it keeps black voters in line, and it hurts their political opponents. Our political system rewards liberals handsomely for making false charges of racism and so they do it constantly.</p>
<p>We now live in an Orwellian world where the government openly discriminates against white Americans, most black Americans openly advocate discriminating in their favor based on the color of their skin, businesses and schools discriminate in favor of black Americans.</p>
<p>Yet people who see every issue through the prism of race regularly accuse the people who don&rsquo;t, of being racist.</p>
<p>{snip}, it&rsquo;s also fair to say that false charges of racism are actually doing more damage than actual racism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that reputations are being smeared and people are even losing their jobs without cause in some cases, but these cries of racism are convincing black Americans of something that&rsquo;s not even remotely true: That a large percentage of their fellow Americans hate them because of the color of their skin. {snip}<br/>

<p>That&rsquo;s where this article goes wrong.  The GOP is not now and will never be on the verge of getting any appreciable percentage of the black vote.  Economics are the reason.</p>

		<p>How much longer are spineless whites going to be cowed by a word?  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of anything so ludicrous in all my life.  </p>
<p>Some dictionaries now claim that the word &#8220;racist&#8221; is the most evil word in the English language.  </p>
<p>Give me a break.  </p>
<p>The word never even existed until it was coined by American communist achademics in 1933.  </p>
<p>Words merely define objects, emotions, beliefs or actions.</p>
<p>Words like rapist, murderer and sadist define truly evil actins.  </p>
<p>A white who won&rsquo;t allow his daughter to date a black or Mestizo is not evil; he is an independent thinker who is wise to the ways of the world&hellip;  </p>

		<p>Racist is a perfectly cromulent word, but it does NOT refer to negative sentiments about blacks, ONLY expressed by whites.  Racism is viewing everything as being caused or affected by racial variables.  That describes the American black and his 150 year failure to locate his bootstraps, much less hoist them.  It&rsquo;s all whitey&rsquo;s fault!</p>
<p>&#8220;I got pulled over when I was speeding&hellip;JUST BECAUSE I&rsquo;M BLACK. The cop was black, but dat don&rsquo;t matta&hellip;he&rsquo;s an oreo!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t get dat job&hellip;JUST BECAUSE I&rsquo;M BLACK.  Or it mighta been cause of dat time I spent in prison for armed robbery, but I only got arrested then&hellip;JUST BECAUSE I&rsquo;M BLACK.  White folks can rob all they want and never get arrested!&#8221;</p>

		<p>While on CNN, Ann Coulter responded to Rich Sanchez&rsquo;s repetition about the &#8220;N&#8221; word being supposedly hurled &#8220;fifteen times&#8221; at black congressmen on Capitol Hill on the day &#8220;health care reform&#8221; passed. (BTW, Andrew Breitbart has proven this to be a lie, and he has offered $100,000.00 to anyone who can offer audio/visual proof of the eptithet-hurling.) </p>
<p>Coulter claimed the name-calling was MANUFACTURED (as usual) by the leftist MSM. Rich Sanchez repeated, ad nauseum, that White Tea Partiers were racist. </p>
<p>Coulter hit back HARD. She repeated that Rick Sanchez is into &#8220;kiddie porn&#8221;. She repeated, &#8220;I have evidence that you have a problem with kiddie porn &hellip; you have a problem with kiddie porn &hellip; in your private room going through kiddie porn&hellip;.&#8221; </p>
<p>Thank you, Ann. I have learned from you that when the lefties bring a knife to a fight, I bring a gun; when they bring a gun, I accuse them of having a problem with kiddie porn. </p>
<p>There ARE worse things to be called than racist. </p>

		<p>Interesting that racism, the belief that there are racial differences, is all but a capital crime.  </p>

		<p>The word Racist is quickly losing it&rsquo;s bite because it&rsquo;s been used so often and so absurdly. Soon it will be material for a Jeff Foxworthy kind of comedy routine - &#8220;You might be a racist if &hellip;.&#8221;.</p>

		<p>let me throw another opinion out there &mdash;  &mdash; <br/>
the reason we are seeing women like Jan Brewer, Palin, Bachman and others being the new, respected politicians on the right, is partially, maybe totally, the result of media/culture tearing down white men so much in the last 40 years that most of us, white men included, can&rsquo;t stand to hear a white man talk or be a politician or anything else respectable. Thank you media, american educators, women, minorities, etc ………… I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re elated..</p>

		<p>By my definition I am not a racist, because I acknowledge that Ashkenazic Jews and Orientals have higher average IQ&rsquo;s than white gentiles like me.  Also, I do not dislike anyone because the person happens to be a member of a given race.<br/>
 <br/>
Nevertheless, when someone calls me a racist, I do not defend myself against the charge.  I ask, &#8220;What did I say that is not true?&#8221;  </p>

		<p>A friend recently accused me of being a racist because I support AZ&rsquo;s SB 1070 (oh and the federal laws too, might I add).  I of course told her that she was only calling me racist because I&rsquo;m white (she&rsquo;s an Israeli raised in the US).</p>
<p>We have been having a 3-WEEK conversation on Facebook about the Rosie the Riveter style picture of Jan Brewer.  She finally got so offended by my persistence in arguing my point that she resorted to the old liberal fallback  &mdash;  you racist!!!  I actually laughed while reading her comment because of how generic and misled her accusation was.</p>
<p>Thankfully, three of my white acquaintances have been reading our back-and-forth comments and have added their own input.  It is about time whites stood up and defended our fellow whites!  It was amazing to see my peers (we&rsquo;re all only 23, mind you) to support my position and make it clear that I was not alone.<br/>
I agree 100% with the other AR posters who have urged everyone to make comments on original news articles and spread the world to other outlets.  I was surprised by the amount of support from my California-native white friends.  </p>

		<p>Back in my brief Haight-Ashbury hippy days I&rsquo;d see Filmore district (black town) blacks visiting the Haight-Ashbury to hit on hippy chicks.  </p>
<p>The girls wouldn&rsquo;t give them the time of day and the blacks would always respond with, &#8220;what the matter baby, you afraid it gonna rub off?&#8221;  </p>
<p>Every waking moment of a black African&rsquo;s life is focused upon a self-made obsession with race.  </p>
<p>They will never be happy as long as they remain black.  </p>
<p>Whenever we respond to allegations of racism we allow ourselves to be sucked into their obsession.</p>
<p>From now on let&rsquo;s simply not respond and let them stew in their own juices…</p>
