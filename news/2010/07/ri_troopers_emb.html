<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rhode Island State Trooper Nuno Vasconcelos was patrolling Interstate 95 a few months ago when he came upon a two-car accident in heavy traffic. The trooper pulled up, stepped out of his cruiser, and asked one of the drivers for his license.</p>
<p>The man said he did not have a license, and under questioning, confessed that he was here illegally from Guatemala.</p>
<p>If the accident had happened 15 miles north in Massachusetts, the man would probably have been arrested for driving without a license, which carries a fine of up to $1,000 and 10 days in jail, then released pending an appearance in district court.</p>
<p>But in Rhode Island, illegal immigrants face a far greater penalty: deportation.</p>
<p>From Woonsocket to Westerly, the troopers patrolling the nation&rsquo;s smallest state are reporting all illegal immigrants they encounter, even on routine stops such as speeding, to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rhode Island&rsquo;s collaboration with federal immigration authorities is controversial; critics say the practice increases racial profiling and makes immigrants afraid to help police solve crimes.</p>
<p>But it is a practice that Governor Deval Patrick&rsquo;s opponents in the governor&rsquo;s race are urging Massachusetts to revive. The Patrick administration has staunchly opposed having state troopers enforce immigration laws, and shortly after he took office in 2007, the governor rescinded a pact by his predecessor, Mitt Romney, to assign 30 troopers to the so-called federal 287(g) program, which trains local police to enforce federal immigration law.</p>

		<p>The county that hosts ultra-liberal Madison, WI, has parts of SB 1070 on the books.  Missouri&rsquo;s immigration law was the toughest in the nation until 1070 came along.  Many states and cities want to implement similar laws ASAP.  Yet, all these libs are only focused on Arizona.</p>
<p>As an aside, when the MLB ASG was in St. Louis last year, MO had already passed and started to enforce its immigration laws, yet there was no pressure on Bud Selig from the Raza kooks to move the ASG out of St. Louis.  Furthermore, Kansas City will host the ASG in 2012, and by then, MO will have upgraded its immigration laws to 1070-style strength.</p>

		<p>According to the artilce, the Police need the help of the Illegal Aliens, to solve crimes. LOL!!!!!</p>
<p>Illegal Aliens commit a good portion of those crimes, so thanks, but no thanks. </p>
<p>Illegals, go back where you came from.  </p>

		<p>Excuse me&hellip;&hellip;deportation is not punishment.</p>
<p>It is never punishment to be returned (at no cost to the deportee) to their native land, to familiar environs, to be surrounded by friends and family. Millions of Mexicans do so during the Christmas holidays at their own expense. It is not punishment.<br>

		<p>There are, no doubt, other states than AZ that have tough anti-illegal laws or are seriously considering them.  But the liberal media has made AZ a bugaboo in order to pretend that the whole idea is an anomaly and beyond the pale.  <br>
How strange is it for a nation to resist invasion by hordes of people spreading crime and economic ruin?  Didn&rsquo;t CA once have the world&rsquo;s sixth largest economy?  Now look at it!</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;critics say the practice&hellip; makes immigrants afraid to help police solve crimes&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the exact justification used in 1979 to defend sanctuary city status for Los Angeles (crafted and implemented by White Police Chief Daryl Gates who was later forced to resign in the aftermath of the rodney king riots).</p>
<p>There has been not one scintilla of evidence that BUT FOR sanctuary city policies immigrants wouldn&rsquo;t come forward to report crime.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe it.  It&rsquo;s part of the White race replacement plan.  </p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t believe me, come and take a look at Los Angeles.</p>
<p>And, if you believe the brown tidal wave won&rsquo;t move your way, and quickly, you haven&rsquo;t been paying attention.</p>

		<p>As a firmly Unreconstructed Rebel, I am highly offended that Massachusetts does not demand that all states who deport illegal aliens, or blacks, send them immediately to Cambridge.</p>
<p>We have more work to do. Our business is truly unfinished. Whites in Mass. are not doing what is required of them to atone for the sins of segregation by holding themselves accountable to people of color for their unearned White Privileges.  </p>
<p>We have good reason to suspect that some Whites in Mass. may be harboring unacknowledged biases against people of color.  We must send a commission there to root out these toxic and virulent strains of ongoing and hateful racism.</p>
