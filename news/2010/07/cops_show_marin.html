			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julie Watson, KNBC (Los Angeles), July 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A tough-talking, muscular Los Angeles police sergeant steadily rattled off tips to a young Marine riding shotgun as they raced in a patrol car to a drug bust: Be aware of your surroundings. Watch people&rsquo;s body language. Build rapport.</p>
<p>Marine Lt. Andrew Abbott, 23, took it all in as he peered out at the graffiti-covered buildings, knowing that the lessons he learned recently in one of the city&rsquo;s toughest neighborhoods could help him soon in the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Abbott was among 70 Camp Pendleton Marines in a training exercise that aims to adapt the investigative techniques the LAPD has used for decades against violent street gangs to take on the Taliban more as a powerful drug-trafficking mob than an insurgency.</p>
<p>The Marines hope that learning to work like a cop on a beat will help them better track the Taliban, build relationships with Afghans leery of foreign troops and make them better teachers as they try to professionalize an Afghan police force beset by corruption.</p>
<p>The troops believe they can learn valuable lessons from the LAPD, which has made inroads into communities after highly publicized abuses, from the videotaped beating of Rodney King to corruption in an anti-gang unit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their role is to win the hearts and minds of the community and that&rsquo;s what they did,&#8221; said Marine Staff Sgt. Brendan Flynn, who also works as a Los Angeles police officer and will be deployed to help train Afghan police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But in many ways, police in Los Angeles&rsquo; crime-ridden neighborhoods use the same skills that Marines say could help them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Marines can gather intelligence by picking up the notebooks, receipts and other papers left behind in raids that could provide insight into the opium business the Taliban uses to buy their weapons, Afghan expert Gretchen Peters said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of the Taliban as the Sopranos in turbans,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think essentially they&rsquo;re criminals.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Because it&rsquo;s working out so well, and by &#8220;it,&#8221; I mean both our domestic law enforcement effort against black and Chicano street gangs, and also the military&rsquo;s efforts against the Taliban.  Honestly, there needs to be a different strategy on both fronts.  And by &#8220;different,&#8221; I mean with fewer ACLU field manuals in mind.</p>

		<p>This idea has great merit. Fighting the insurgency type of war does include a lot of ideas used in fighting the street gang type of warfare found in American cities.</p>
<p>Confidential informants, rapport with the general public, gun shot residue testing, etc.</p>
<p>But it is also a bad sign too that the situation in the many American cities has become so bad.</p>
<p>These street gangs are a REAL THREAT TO U.S. DOMESTIC NATIONAL SECURITY.</p>
<p>Gangs that for some time have had the numbers, organization, money, lethality of weaponry, just plain ordinary mental wherewithal to kill in a callous and casual manner, dominating neighborhoods in the manner of a militia that pays no heed to laws or governmental control. A law unto itself.</p>

		<p>There is no Taliban.  The Afghans want us out of their country.  We will never &#8220;win the hearts and minds&#8221; of the Afghans by occupying their country and killing their people, or by any other method.  They want us gone.  More and more will join the resistance, either overtly or covertly.  Eventually we&rsquo;ll leave.</p>
<p>We, meaning Whites, will also never win the hearts and minds of the dysfunctional racial minorities infesting our cities.  They do not want to change who or what they are, and they hate Whites.  They&rsquo;ll sit up and smile or frown on command once in a while if they think an idiotic White will give them something, but muggings and riots will do just fine.</p>
<p>The only common denominator between the Afghans and the slum dwellers is how deluded Whites see them.</p>

<p>So Ms Gretchen Peters is an American-style &#8216;Area Specialist&rsquo; is she? &hellip; i.e. she has read 5 undemanding paperbacks and a few back copies of National Geographic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sopranos in Turbans&#8221; is such a grotesque category error; none of the U.S. crime families engage in suicide bombings or fighting to the last man. Their smooth-tongued and expensively-suited lawyers would strenuously advise against it!</p>
<p>Love them passionately or hate them with a vengeance, the armed Taliban militants see themselves as both Mujahedeen - warriors fighting for the sacred cause of Islam - and Afghan patriots struggling to oust the foreigners and slay the traitors.</p>
<p>It will take a lot more than playing GOOD COP / BAD COP to defeat them.</p>

		<p>AFG used to be a pretty worthless place but now the game has changed.  It&rsquo;s rich in mineral deposits, precious metals and gemstone veins.  After 3 tours there, I thought that something was very strange indeed when my helicopter lift battalion was tasked to take these civilian teams up north with all their gear and slingload a few vehicles for them.  A few trips outbound with these grim guys would turn into all smiles on the return trips with loads of core samples.  AFG could be worth the price in blood if..and it&rsquo;s a big if, that the US would start thinking empire and go in full corporate mode to build roads, mining and refining operations, air fields, etc.  Somehow, the locals would have to evaporate.  If another country got into AFG, say like China, there would be just stacks of bloody pancake hats everywhere and the mineral wealth would be developed. </p>

		<p>Who&rsquo;s training who here? I really doubt if the Marines need any training in urban warfare from the LAPD, not after almost a decade of constant warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan. Most likely, the marines are training the cops. </p>
<p>This is all part of the federalization and militarization of US police forces which has been going on for some time now. The military is all over these days  &mdash;  &#8220;helping&#8221; the police at accident scenes and sobriety checkpoints, &#8220;helping&#8221; them search for contraband and drugs  &mdash;  all of it in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>
<p>The military and police have been practicing weapon-confiscation drills in cities for a long time now and we already know from Hurricane Katrina that they WILL confiscate your LEGAL guns if ordered to do so. Maybe I&rsquo;m just being paranoid, but I think exercises like this one in LA are just another sign of what&rsquo;s coming. Decaying multicultural empires can only be held together by force and the US is starting to turn into a typical third world police state.<br>

		<p>Wow!  This article is deeply disturbing and brought forth hoary images of Southern Reconstruction!</p>
<p>Remember that in the US of A we have the Law of Posse Comitatus! ( <a href="https://tinyurl.com/b3r7s" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/b3r7s</a> )   Military members are NOT supposed to be out helping law enforcement in any way shape or form.  </p>
<p>Yes this is just some training program, but there are dangers it could morph into something much worse.  Indeed it would not surprise me if Comrade Obama (taking a page from MARSHAL Stalin, remember Stalin was in charge of the military in the USSR) was planning to use the military to oppress Whites further!  Already happened once during Reconstruction!  </p>

		<p>If we follow the strategy of the left and pull out of Afganistan, and Iraq, and allow all our other enemies to become world powers, we will assuredly be fighting them on our home soil. We will then not be thousands of miles from home in wars which are nessessary. As to making friends of those we are fighting, this is not the purpose of war. In every war ever fought there have been civilian casualties, yet when they were over if there was a clear victory things returned to normal, whatever that means. Freedom is not free, thus if we stand back in fear we will appear a weak sister and an easy foe, inviting attacks on our soil. The main difference between fighting street gangs and foreign enemies is we can readily return fire on the latter, whereas the liberal powers that be will not allow this as to the former. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s nonsense, of course.  Who do you think is the main driving force behind the resistance to American occupation of Afghanistan?  </p>
<p>&#8220;The Afghans want us out of their country.&#8221;</p>
<p>How do you know?  Did you take a nationwide poll?  Undoubtedly there are many Afghans (especially Afghan tribalists and Islamists) who would like nothing better than to see American forces leave.  However, I&rsquo;m willing to wager a lot of Afghans (especially Afghan women) would like to see us succeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will never &ldquo;win the hearts and minds&rdquo; of the Afghans by occupying their country and killing their people, or by any other method.&#8221;</p>
<p>More nonsense.  Read a good history book, sometime.  By &#8220;good&#8221; I mean not the p.c. trash they give out to our youth in high school and college.</p>
<p>In the 19th century the British occupied what is now India outright.  They discovered the existence of murderous religious cults, collectively called Thuggee, that had been in operation for probably centuries.  None of the local rulers had ever succeeded in putting a dent in it.  In fact, many paid &#8220;protection&#8221; to the Thuggee out of fear.</p>
<p>The British reaction was to suppress this cult ruthlessly and mercilessly!  </p>

<p>Simultaneously, the Brits modernized travel through India (by introducing railroads) making Thuggee a far less lucrative endeavor.  Long before the Brits withdrew from India in 1947, Thuggee was extinct.</p>
<p>No sane person in India today misses the Thugs, even if they don&rsquo;t want to admit who was responsible for ridding India of that pestilence.</p>

<p>Of course, all this occurred before the days of &#8220;civil rights&#8221; for non-Whites.  So when you say &#8220;&hellip;or by any other method&#8221;, what you really mean is, BY ANY OTHER MODERN METHOD!</p>
<p>&#8220;We, meaning Whites, will also never win the hearts and minds of the dysfunctional racial minorities infesting our cities.&#8221;</p>
<p>On that we are in complete agreement.  We shouldn&rsquo;t even try.  I think I speak for the bulk of posters here that ideally these &#8220;dysfunctional racial minorities&#8221; have no business being in this country in the first place. </p>

		<p>&#8220;If we follow the strategy of the left and pull out of Afghanistan, and Iraq, and allow all our other enemies to become world powers, we will assuredly be fighting them on our home soil.&#8221;</p>
<p>Getting out of Iraq and Afghanistan isn&rsquo;t just a policy of the left. A lot of people on the right, especially the true conservative right and most white nationalists, have been opposed to both wars from the beginning. Both wars are wars of aggression, i.e. war crimes, and neither of them have anything to do with American freedom.  If anything, we have less freedom now than we did before the Bush mob lied us into these foreign quagmires. The increasing presence of military troops on our streets, the growing surveillance, the gradual elimination of the Bill of Rights   &mdash;   all of this is only going to get worse now that the Black Messiah has expanded the war in Afghanistan, started a new one in Pakistan and seems determined to attack Iran.</p>
<p>As for killing civilians, the military has been doing a good job of this, especially in Afghanistan: bombing wedding parties and blowing up entire families, killing parents in front of their children, wiping out entire neighborhoods, etc.. The slaughter of civilians is only getting worse with the use of unmanned drones and the important thing to remember here is that all of these dead civilians have families and friends. The military is perfectly aware that it&rsquo;s creating more enemies every time it kills innocent civilians, but it looks like the &#8220;collateral damage&#8221; is only going to increase now that Petraeus has taken over from McChrystal. You don&rsquo;t actually have to care about murdering innocent civilians to see that it&rsquo;s a losing strategy.</p>
<p>Both wars were lost before they even started. There is no such thing as &#8220;victory&#8221; in situations like this. The rationale for both of these occupations has changed repeatedly over the years   &mdash;   an obvious sign that (1) we are being lied to, and (2) our glorious leaders have no idea what they are doing. When it comes to Iraq, we should have pulled our troops out as soon as it became obvious that Bush and his cronies had lied about weapons of mass destruction, and I have absolutely no idea what Obama thinks he&rsquo;s doing in Afghanistan. I thought the whole rationale there was to go after Al Qaeda, but the director of national intelligence has already said that there are probably only about 100 Al Qaeda fighters in the whole country. (And that assumes that Al Qaeda actually exists as a distinct organization.) And whatever happened to Osama bin Laden? If Obama&rsquo;s handlers are serious about &#8220;building democracy&#8221; in Afghanistan   &mdash;   a stupid idea on the face of it   &mdash;   then why are they supporting an absolutely corrupt puppet like Karzai? It makes no sense.</p>
<p>In any case, I doubt if either of these wars can go on much longer. The country is broke and can no longer afford to spend billions of dollars a day in Afghanistan and Iraq. The United States certainly looks like the bad guy in this situation, but saying that doesn&rsquo;t make me unpatriotic because this really isn&rsquo;t the United States anymore. We&rsquo;re going to keep seeing military exercises like the one being conducted in Los Angeles and eventually we&rsquo;ll wake up to find troops on the streets just like in every other third world country. And make no mistake about it. That&rsquo;s where were heading if Obama&rsquo;s handlers get the Third World war they&rsquo;re looking for.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not really the same situation.  The Taliban are much better armed, much better organized and much more willing to sacrifice for their cause than gang members are.  Gang members in LA don&rsquo;t have recoilless rifles, mortars and 12.7mm machine guns.  There aren&rsquo;t ghettos in America where the authorities can only enter in battalion sized units with armored vehicles and close air support.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pitiful to read supposedly pro-white individuals who have drunk the neocon kool-aid on the necessity of endless wars in the Middle East.  </p>
