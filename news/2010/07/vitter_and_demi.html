			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FAIR Legislative Update, Federation for American Immigration Reform, July 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Last week, Senators David Vitter (R-LA) and Jim DeMint (R-SC) introduced an amendment to the small business bill (H.R.5297) that would deny the federal government funding to sue Arizona over its recently enacted immigration enforcement law, SB 1070. The DeMint-Vitter amendment (#4464) succinctly states: &#8220;No funds made available in any provision of law may be used to participate in any lawsuit that seeks to invalidate those provisions of the Arizona Revised Statutes amended by Arizona Senate Bill 1070.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; The small business bill is currently pending in the Senate and is set to be debated this week. (Politico, July 16, 2010).</p>
<p>In a statement released alongside the amendment, Senator DeMint remarked, &#8220;States like Arizona shouldn&rsquo;t be prosecuted for protecting their citizens when the federal government fails to do so. Instead of suing states for doing his job, the President should get serious and stop holding border security hostage to pass amnesty and score points with his liberal base.&#8221; (DeMint/Vitter Press Release, July 14, 2010). Senator Vitter added, &#8220;The Obama administration should not use taxpayers&rsquo; money to pay for these lawsuits that the American people overwhelmingly oppose.&#8221; Id. A Fox News poll released last Thursday shows that most American voters oppose the lawsuit by 59-29 percent. (Fox News, July 15, 2010).<br>

		<p>This is why, for all their other faults, the Republicans should at least take back the House.  All spending bills must start in the House, and a Republican-run House, assuming it has its act together and is playing with all 52 in the deck, can simply refuse to fund Obama extremism, including the costs of the Federal/DOJ lawsuit against SB 1070.</p>

		<p>The purpose of the lawsuit is to weld the Mexican population, both illegal and legal, here and the US, to the interests of the Democrat party. The suit does not have to succeed in the court for it to succeed as part of a larger marketing effort.</p>

		<p>Theres a novel idea. Cut the govt funding. Politicians feed all their lives off the dole. Well hell cant you just print more cash? Does money not grow on trees? Republicans feed at the trough as much as Democrats. Bush and Bush and their neocons destroyed taxpayers and both collect pensions for life. The problem is on both sides of the isle. Always has been always will be. </p>

		<p>Good point, Question Diversity.  Moreover, since lawsuits take quite some time to run their course, the funding can be yanked after the November election, once the GOP controls the House.  Now would be nice, but late November is just as good.</p>

		<p>Good theory, but will not work. First, the Democrats won&rsquo;t even let this come to a vote and if it does it will not pass with the Dems in control of Congress.  Even if the bill passes the thugs at DOJ will simply take the money from another project.  They are not contolled by anyone.</p>

		<p>Why should there be federal funding for any lawsuit involving the governments anywhere? All of the attorneys, clerks and such are on paid salary which they get work or not. Most of the &#8220;work&#8221; will be done by phone or e-mail and most involved will never leave their offices in District of Coloreds. </p>
