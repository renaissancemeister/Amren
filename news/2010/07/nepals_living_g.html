<h1>Nepal&rsquo;s &#8216;Living Goddess&rsquo; Passes School Leaving Exam</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gopal Sharma, Reuters, July 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Nepali girl revered by many as a &#8220;living goddess&#8221; has become the first sitting deity to pass the high school leaving certificate exam, setting her on course for a career in banking.</p>
<p>Chanira Bajracharya, 15, called Kumari, was among nearly half a million children who took the exams in March. The results were declared late on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;She scored 80.12 percent marks in the exam,&#8221; said Abha Awale, a teacher who gave private tuitions to the girl in her temple as she is not allowed to mingle with outsiders.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a distinction (top grade),&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Bajracharya has already scored high marks among devotees in the ancient town of Patan, south of Kathmandu, where she rides in decorated chariots 18 times year during Hindu and Buddhist festivals. She has been Kumari of Patan for nine years now.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Former Kumaris, considered incarnations of the Hindu goddess Kali, have gone on to work or got married after they retired, which is usually at the onset of puberty.</p>
<p>Girls from Kathmandu&rsquo;s Newar community are chosen by Buddhist priests to serve as &#8220;living goddesses,&#8221; and confined to temples in the three ancient cities of the Kathmandu valley.</p>
<p>Critics say the centuries-old tradition denies them a normal life and leaves them unprepared to face real life after retirement.</p>

		<p>The Nepalese are not so bad.  In the US our marxist overlords despise virgins.  Instead of driving this little girl in chariots marxists would forcibly take her from her home and into foster care and a multicultural prison.  On the positive side, she would get free condoms, and wouldn&rsquo;t need her parents permission to get an abortion.  </p>
<p>You would think, however, that Kali would appeal to feminists (and some congressmen). </p>

		<p>A rather neat story. But we also have a Pope who has a direct line to God, so the story goes&hellip; </p>

<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s not like she was on &#8216;Diff&rsquo;rent Strokes&rsquo; or anything, she&rsquo;ll be fine. Nice costume too.<br>
Speaking for myself, I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded being pandered to for being an incarnation of Shiva when I was a youngster - sounds like fun! Don&rsquo;t have to go to school with the herd either.</p>

If nothing else, she at least (apparently) got a good education out of the deal. And why is she still the &#8220;Incarnation of Kali&#8221; at the age of 15 when girls usually retire at the onset of puberty? Most girls enter puberty at the ages of 11-13.</p>

		<p>Am I the only person who finds this story typical of the Third World?  The comments above sound like something out of a liberal college professor book club gathering.  It is fine and dandy to talk about how &#8220;the Nepalese do this and this better than Westerners&#8221;, but at the end of the day, it is a Third World country with Third World problems.</p>

		<p>What kind of deity gets only a &#8220;B&#8221; on her report card?Aren&rsquo;t they supposed to be all-powerful?or at least like a comic book super-villain.Also why does the deity Dalai lama wear glasses,get gallstones,diarrhea?etc&hellip;sounds pretty mortal to me.</p>
