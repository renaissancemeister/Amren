			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FoxNews, June 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Boycotting Arizona is harder than it sounds.</p>
<p>Though the passage of the state&rsquo;s immigration law was met in late April with immediate threats to cut ties with Arizona in protest, a number of cities have either scaled back or created exemptions to their own boycotts.</p>
<p>The resolutions also have demanded a mountain of work by officials at the city level tasked with reviewing hundreds of internal contracts for any trace of Arizona to see whether it&rsquo;s prudent to cut ties. As the review process gets underway, the result may be a patchwork of targeted boycotts rather a blanket ban on all things Arizona.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles City Council was the latest to amend its boycott last Wednesday, when lawmakers voted to make an exemption so that an Arizona-based company that operates enforcement cameras at Los Angeles intersections can continue to do business there.</p>
<p>The program earned the city $6 million last year. City officials cited economic as well as public safety concerns in arguing to extend the contract with American Traffic Solutions, based in Scottsdale. Los Angeles Councilman Richard Alarcon said the boycott was &#8220;never intended to impede public safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The San Jose City Council this month opted against a full-fledged boycott in favor of a resolution that merely condemned Arizona&rsquo;s law and put a halt on official travel there. Officials expressed concern about the importance of the contracts the city had with Arizona firms.</p>
<p>Then the Sacramento City Council imposed a boycott, but decided to keep an existing contract with Arizona-based Taser International. According to Fox40, the city&rsquo;s police force buys tasers and other equipment from the company and did not find it &#8220;practical&#8221; to end the contract  &mdash;  since it would be too expensive to find another seller.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Berkeley last month, the city passed a resolution to restrict &#8220;nonessential&#8221; city employee travel to Arizona and urge the city manager to refrain from entering into new contracts with firms that are headquartered in Arizona. The resolution urged the city manager to consider discontinuing existing contracts with such companies, but, according to a council memo, only when doing so would be &#8220;consistent with the terms of those contracts and principles of fiscal responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Oakland, the City Council recently approved a $1 million contract with an ad firm that has corporate offices in Arizona despite imposing an anti-Arizona boycott. The Bay Citizen reported that city officials justified the exemption by saying their city&rsquo;s boycott  &mdash;  like Berkeley&rsquo;s  &mdash;  specified that targeted companies must be &#8220;headquartered&#8221; in Arizona. Clear Channel Outdoor lists its headquarters as San Antonio.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Berkeley, in its official report on the city&rsquo;s boycott, said the Arizona bill will &#8220;inevitably lead to racial profiling, jeopardizes public safety and creates a wedge between law enforcement and ethnic communities.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Not one mention that such a thing is the only legitimate violation of the commerce clause of the US constitution.</p>
<p>Such a &#8220;boycott&#8221; should open the offenders to almost unlimited liability.  A tsunami of torts.</p>
<p>I hope the Arizona legislature understands this and goes after these guys, including the federal government.</p>
<p>It would be very interesting to see the level of sympathy a jury would have for cases like this.  It&rsquo;s one thing for these local governments to act as if they have the will of the people behind them.  It is quite another for them to lose multi billion dollar lawsuits as these same people see the opportunity to punish liberals in a very direct manner.</p>

		<p>As an ex-South African, I remember the boycotts instigated against South Africa in the late &#8216;60&rsquo;s.  One of the first boycotters was the US company Eastman-Kodak, as they were known then.  Hardly were they out of the door, when Fuji, the Japanese film manufacturer appeared as if by magic, flooding the country with cheap, plentiful, and, above all, quality merchandise.  </p>
<p>When the lights went out for the last time in 1994 and the ANC came to power, KODAK was back, but never recovered a fraction of the market share that they had had in the previous years. They had actually helped Fuji to become a world-beater.</p>
<p>US and UK arms and ammunition manufacturers boycotted the republic as well, only to have their places promptly filled by Europe   &mdash;   as well as being instrumental in forcing South Africa to develop its own very successful arms industry.  The guys who brought you the G5 and G6 155mm self-propelled guns.</p>
<p>One really funny unintended consequence was the outsourcing by the British govt. of manufacture of military ammunition to Pakistan whose failure rates could be measured in percent, while South Africa offered the same ammunition to the UK   &mdash;   but manufactured to a quality where failure rates were measured in units per million.  The Brits took the Pakistani ammunition.  I wonder how many lives that cost.</p>
<p>Keep it up, Arizona &hellip; my heart is with you.  Give &#8216;em Hell.</p>

		<p>A funny thing happened on the way to upbraiding Arizona. No doubt in the last several weeks, these city officials and others started receiving lots of letters, phone calls, and emails from &ldquo;certain Californians&rdquo; who stood to lose something &mdash; maybe a whole lot of something. So now, they&rsquo;ve decided to abrogate a bit while trying to save face. No wonder more jokes are made about California than any other state. They are a joke.</p>

<p>Did Israel ever boycott South Africa formally?  Internet searches are futile in trying to find the answer.</p>
<p>The reason I would guess that they didn&rsquo;t is because the news just came out several weeks ago that Shimon Peres offered P.W. Botha nukes while they were their countries&rsquo; respective Defense Secretaries, and this offer was made in 1975, at the height of the international boycottmania of South Africa.  (The American boycott, peddled through the U.S. House by Nut Gingrich, and ultimately signed by Ronald Reagan, wouldn&rsquo;t happen until the next decade.)  I can ill imagine that Israel would offer South Africa nukes then turn right around and boycott them for their racial &#8220;apartheid.&#8221;  IMHO, Israel offered ZA nukes because like knows like.  Or, birds of a feather.</p>

		<p>Gary is right.  The G-5 and G-6 155mm guns are the best artillery pieces in the world.  These have been sold in numbers to Brazil, and Iraq had also purchased many before the 1991 war (USAF F-111s, with their very accurate all-weather capability took destroyed them during the air war; they were of more concern to US planners than Iraq&rsquo;s big tank park).</p>
<p>As an answer to &#8220;Question Diversity&#8221;, no Israel did not boycott South Africa.  The SADF uses a version of the Israeli &#8220;Galil&#8221; assault rifle (with a longer buttstuck, as English and Dutchmen have longer arms than Levantines).  This, by the way is really just a 5.56mm version of the Finnish &#8220;Valmet&#8221;, which in turn is sort of a &#8220;Rolls Royce&#8221; version of the AK-47 (the Galil appears to have been replaced by the M-16 in Israeli service, at least to judge by the news photographs.)  Israel and South Africa also had a largely shared nuclear program, with one atmospheric test being conducted off the Atlantic coast of SA.</p>
<p>The genius behind the G-5 and G-6, Gerald Bull managed to have himself assassinated by the Mossad in Belgium, because he was intimately involved in the pre-1991 Iraqi &#8220;supergun&#8221; project.<br>

		<p>Death By Boycott is an act of Bureaucracy.  A killing of a thousand paper cuts.</p>
<p>If you want to render these fools impotent, start getting behind OTHER State legislative efforts to stiff arm illegals.</p>
<p>Only once the number of &#8216;racist&rsquo; targets is diffused through so many states with so many Commerce Contracts that they cannot be punished, individually or mutually, without serious cuts into the GDP as well as local revenues, will the Right Thing get done in the absence of Federal enforcement.</p>
<p>And only by utterly humiliating Federal Law Enforcement (essentially removing from the executive branch one of it&rsquo;s empowerments of office, asking the Federal Border Patrol to _leave the effected states_ and replacing them with new-hires) will the Administration be shamed into defaulting their rabidly liberalist views.</p>
<p>Nation derives from &#8216;Nescare&rsquo; or _to be born_.  It implies that one is born into a culture where acceptance based on race leads to inculcation of ideals.  You never get that with foreigners.</p>
<p>Just ask the Romans.  Oh, that&rsquo;s right, ROME FELL TO BARBARIAN INVADERS WHOM THEY INVITED IN.</p>
<p>In Brimelow&rsquo;s 1994 book _Alien Nation_, the Border Patrol officers he talked to said that they were catching ONE IN THREE.  Which means if they sent home 300-500,000 people a year, a decade and a half later, we should be looking 15 million illegals.  At Least.</p>
<p>Time is not our friend here.  People who breed as rapidly and as young as Hispanics (highest unwed teen pregnancy rate in the country, beating blacks by miles and yards) will quickly become able to effect social politics.  All the more so if the various efforts to enable illegal voting are themselves pushed through.</p>
<p>This is what the rush to &#8216;reform&rsquo; immigration is about.  Getting it done in time to make rapid changes in total voting bloc sizes matter.</p>

		<p>To Question Diversity (5) and Michael C. Scott (6), I feel that you are both quite correct.</p>
<p>Back in the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s it seemed an open secret (in South Africa, anyway) that Israel and ZA were co-dependent on each other as far as military R&D; was concerned.</p>
<p>I can come up with no concrete examples now   &mdash;   30 years blows a lot of brain cells   &mdash;   but even the MSM in South Africa often made casual references to Israeli - South Africa cooperation in the military sphere &hellip; and no one in South Africa really thought anything of it.</p>
<p>I personally feel that because Israel and South Africa were pretty much the skunks of the world then, we saw no reason to pretend otherwise.</p>
<p>Now that South Africa has been Leeeeberated to the taste of the west and consists of happy smiling workers marching shoulder to shoulder into a brighter future &hellip; the mantle of skunkdom has, sadly, settled on the shoulders of Israel alone.</p>
<p>  &mdash;   And Arizona, of course.</p>
<p>I imagine that we are seeing just the beginning of the anti-Arizona campaign now, and that in six months to a year from now the state will be swimming in a sea of boiling bile and vitriol.</p>
<p>Look for posters in primary colours showing Arizonans bayonetting puppies and reducing cute little mestizos into bars of soap.</p>
<p>See if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

<p>That probably proves that the news story re Peres-Botha and nukes is correct.  The reason I asked the question is that I wanted to send a subliminal message to a certain constituency that reads AR, and might post every once in awhile.  I&rsquo;ll give you a hint:  They&rsquo;re obsessed with a certain ethnicity.</p>

<p><br>
That obsession has only one source, the repeated observation that the one nameless ethnicity is specifically and always involved wherever you find anti-white racism, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Show me a company, group or state engaged in anti-white racism and I will point out a specific person of this nationality that seems to be running things behind the scenes.</p>
<p>They are not in the shadows and haven&rsquo;t been for a long time.  They operate openly and arrogantly.  They admit to what they are doing and laugh in your face about it.</p>
<p>Even then, most whites deny it, or, at least, won&rsquo;t talk about it&hellip;.the brainwashing is so complete.</p>

		<p>First, Isn&rsquo;t this what the commerce clause was supposed to stop? Have we been dragged back 250yrs by this president?</p>
<p>Second, the boycotters REALLY don&rsquo;t want to push this. If AZ can&rsquo;t say no, the sanctuary cities can&rsquo;t say yes. This would be disasterous if taken to even a liberal supreme court.</p>
<p>Third, cudos to AZ and Fremont, NE. I&rsquo;d buy y&rsquo;all a drink if I could find a bar big enough.</p>
