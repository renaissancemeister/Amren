<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38417091/ns/us_news-immigration_a_nation_divided/">Immigrant Groups Criticize Fingerprint Initiative</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ivan Morena, MSNBC, July 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The federal government is rapidly expanding a program to identify illegal immigrants using fingerprints from arrests, drawing opposition from local authorities and advocates who argue the initiative amounts to an excessive dragnet.</p>
<p>The program has gotten less attention than Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration law, but it may end up having a bigger impact because of its potential to round up and deport so many immigrants nationwide.</p>
<p>The San Francisco sheriff wanted nothing to do with the program, and the City Council in Washington, D.C., blocked use of the fingerprint plan in the nation&rsquo;s capital. Colorado is the latest to debate the program, called Secure Communities, and immigrant groups have begun to speak up, telling the governor in a letter last week that the initiative will make crime victims reluctant to cooperate with police &#8220;due to fear of being drawn into the immigration regime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the program, the fingerprints of everyone who is booked into jail for any crime are run against FBI criminal history records and Department of Homeland Security immigration records to determine who is in the country illegally and whether they&rsquo;ve been arrested previously. Most jurisdictions are not included in the program, but Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been expanding the initiative.</p>

		<p>The anti-White Marxist crowd makes the job of White Men quite easy, sometimes.  Especially when ANY method of enforcing laws against illegal aliens is criticized because&hellip;it will work!  That&rsquo;s right, the law is racist because it will work, and because it will have its intended effect  &mdash;   driving out illegals!</p>
<p>The jig is up, neo-Marxists! Even White sympathy has its limits, and in a recession/depression, Whites are no longer willing to allow Mexicans to steal their land, food, welfare, taxes, medical care, daughters, and jobs!</p>

		<p>Same old whine from the same old whiners.<br>
Just like LEGAL American citizens; if you&rsquo;re not breaking the law, you have nothing to worry about.<br>
From the artcle:<br>
In Ohio, Butler County Sheriff Rick Jones praised program, which was implemented in his jurisdiction earlier this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s really a heaven-sent for us,&#8221; Jones said. He said the program helps solve the problem police often have of not knowing whether someone they arrested has a criminal history and is in the country illegally.<br>
&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want them in my community,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve got enough homegrown criminals here.&#8221;<br>
Carl Rusnok, an ICE spokesman, said Secure Communities is a way for law enforcement to identify illegal immigrants after their arrest at no additional cost to local jurisdictions. Jones agreed.<br>
&#8220;We arrest these people anyway,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All it does is help us deport people who shouldn&rsquo;t be here.&#8221;<br>
It&rsquo;s a win-win for law enforcement and for those of us who belong here.</p>

		<p>Fingerprinting is standard procedure during any arrest. The only difference is that this law wants to check those fingerprints against a database of illegal aliens who&rsquo;ve previously committed crimes. Those &#8220;immigrant groups&#8221; simply don&rsquo;t want any illegal alien deported regardless of what crimes they commit. That&rsquo;s just sick.</p>
