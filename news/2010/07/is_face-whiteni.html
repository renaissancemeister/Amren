<h1>Is Face-Whitening Widget Beyond the Pale?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andy Winter, Sky News (UK), July 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An application allowing Facebook users in India to digitally whiten their profile pictures has sparked controversy.</p>
<p>It has been launched to promote its range of skin-lightening products for men, advertised by Bollywood star Shahid Kapoor.</p>
<p>The Facebook page leading to the application  &mdash;  called Vaseline Men BE PREPARED  &mdash;  has so far attracted more than 600 fans.</p>
<p>The market for skin-lightening cream in India is estimated to be worth more than Â£325m a year.</p>
<p>Sales of products for men grew by 25% in 2009.</p>
<p>TK Oommen, a sociology professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, said: &#8220;Indians believe that if you have fair skin you belong to the higher caste.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, one customer said: &#8220;If I don&rsquo;t make (my face) fairer, I&rsquo;m worried I&rsquo;ll have trouble finding a woman to marry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the idea has drawn criticism with some arguing it reinforces negative stereotypes about darker skin.</p>
<p>Describing Vaseline&rsquo;s campaign as &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221;, Alexis Madrigal, a columnist for magazine The Atlantic, added: &#8220;(It) is a rather icky reminder of the &#8216;pigmentocracy&rsquo; that exists in many countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The creams work by targeting melanine, the skin pigment that absorbs darkening ultra-violet light.</p>
<p>The cosmetics market leader in India, Emami, has run into fierce criticism for its advertising of &#8216;Fair and Lovely&rsquo; for women and &#8216;Fair and Teen&rsquo; for teenagers.</p>
<p>A 2003 campaign featuring a dark-skinned woman who was unable to get married was branded &#8220;highly racist&#8221; by Brinda Karat, general secretary of the All India Democratic Women&rsquo;s Association.</p>

		<p>Why is it that lighter skin is almost universally seen as more desirable than darker?* </p>
<p>Ah, these white debbils, they sure be brainwashin&rsquo; the world over!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t get it. Being attracted to dark skin, and having given up on finding a worthwhile black (well, you know&hellip;) or hispanic (sweet, but too dumb) female companion, Indian women are my latest kick. They&rsquo;re smart and feminine, but so many of them have that snooty, superior attitude. NOW I read that they want to lighten their skin to appear more attractive.</p>
<p>Why does virtually everyone else in the world hate whitey, yet seek to be like us???</p>

		<p>If the author of this story knew anything about Indian society for the last three thousand years (but who expects a journalist to know anything about which they write!), He&rsquo;d know that Indian culture is rooted 100% in skin color, or RACE.<br>
I won&rsquo;t give any details. Just do some reading, folks. Look to ancient texts, and even to Good old Gandhi.</p>

		<p>Being fair is a big advantage in getting a good husband, wife or job in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh etc&hellip; Skin products of this sort are very popular there.<br>

<p>This could be because most Indian elites (even before the British) had a tendency to be fairer then the people around them. Check out Mughal Emperor Akbar.<br>

<p>Being want to look like White people is only a partial reason for this, their elites are fairer as well and the common man wants to look like them.<br>
Light skinned elites ruling over darker masses has always been a natural phenomenon in the brown skinned world ( Middle East, South Asia, South East Asia) throughout history.<br>

		<p>Chinese people were coloring their faces white 4000 years ago.<br>
But of course that was because of white racist Television too.</p>
<p>@ 2  &mdash;  generalquagmyer <br>
Everyone hates whitey because everyone wants to be whitey. Having a great history, living in good areas and where ever whitey is there is money and wealth. The only people who don&rsquo;t hate whitey are the folks who are rich themselves like Japanese. The are proud of their race without hating whitey.<br>
Furthermore our liberals keep on telling whenever they can how bad whites are and that other folks are not reaching any wealth because of racist whitey. And so any one who watches TV starts to hate whites- even many whites.</p>

		<p>The caste system is actually called the &#8220;Varna&#8221; system. <br>
&#8220;Varna&#8221; is the Sanskrit work for &#8220;Color&#8221;. Thus the caste system is the &#8220;Varna/Color&#8221; system. Whites are higher, Dark is lower.</p>
<p>&#8220;Caste&#8221; is a later, Western addition into the Indian British colonial system. The Varna/Color system had existed in India for centuries before Western colonization. </p>
<p>Get over it, postcolonial theorists. White=Good. Black=Bad.</p>
<p>Read the Vedas and Upanishads.</p>

		<p>Be glad you&rsquo;re white I guess; I couldn&rsquo;t imagine wanting to dye away my very skin color. Though, I guess that&rsquo;s an Asian Indian thing, I haven&rsquo;t heard of South American Indians / hispanics doing any such thing. </p>

<p>I wish you luck in your search for an Indian belle. That said, from my experience Indian women (especially those here in the United States) are among the most class oriented people on the planet.  They look down on whites, viewing most of us as &#8220;trash&#8221; as almost exclusively stick to their own.  Only well educated, professional and wealthy white men are viewed as eligible husbands by the overwhelming majority of Indian ladies.     </p>

<p>With all due respect this is illogical. Just because Indian women refuse to date you doesn&rsquo;t mean they automatically  hate you. You are employing a similar &#8220;you are a racist&#8221; argument that WN&rsquo;s believe African American when whites decline their dating requests.  <br>

Maybe those snooty, haughty Indian women don&rsquo;t feel superior to everyone - just you.<br>
And maybe there&rsquo;s a reason for it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Only&hellip;wealthy white men are viewed as eligible husbands&hellip;&#8221;. Well who wants to be a husband? In my limited experience,Indian women seem to be pretty &#8220;pro-white guy&#8221;. Maybe the pressure of the family obviates the possibilty of wedded bliss with the pale male,but  &mdash;  so what?!? I had a pretty indian married lady make it clear to my thick skulled self that she was interested in some fun,but I was too dumb to realize it was a,you know,invitation. Too late wisdom,as the Germans say. I had another very young sweet girl show interest,and this time I was ready,but honestly I didnt find her at all attractive.  Anyway,I dont mean to bore with my sordid life! But general quagmeyer,whats wrong with good old fashioned white women?? There must be SOME that are worth  their salt!  </p>

<p>Indian honeys are sweeter and more femine. Nothing against white ladies, just a personal preference for exotic damsels</p>
