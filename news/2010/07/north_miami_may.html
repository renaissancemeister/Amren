<h1>North Miami Mayor Invites 55,000 Haitians to Settle in His City</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sun-Sentinel (Palm Beach), July 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mayor Andre Pierre says 55,000 Haitians waiting for visas to the United States are welcome to settle in his city {snip}.</p>
<p>Pierre, a Haitian-American immigrant and lawyer, said he did not think the sudden influx of people from earthquake-ravaged Haiti would be a burden on his city of about 60,000 residents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some residents said they were concerned about the current unemployment rate and lack of space to accommodate thousands of arrivals.<br>

		<p>The French-speaking city of Montreal, Quebec began taking in Haitians in the 1970&rsquo;s under the guidance of Marxist-inspired separatist politicians.</p>
<p>Whole neighborhoods have now undergone what the locals call &#8220;Bronxification&#8221;, i.e. turned into black ghettos. The most wanted criminals in Montreal are now almost all black gang members from Haiti.</p>

		<p>Of course the mayor supports Haitians settling in North Miami - it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s Haitian. He&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to admit persons of other ethnic origins - Russian, Chinese, Mexican, etc. - because he would have no loyalty to them. Only liberal whites support immigration of all kinds of people into their countries. Regardless of whether they&rsquo;re liberal or conservative, non-whites rigidly stick to supporting their own respective communities.</p>

Surfside 6 was the name of the show for those who are trying to remember.<br>
 And speaking of shows, the more old black and white movies I watch, they more they start to seem like Twighlight Zone episodes. I find myself asking, &#8220;Where did all those White people go?!?&#8221; </p>

		<p> When blacks move into a neighborhood the crime rate goes up.  The tax base goes down.  Welfare expense goes up.  Public schools become dangerous places where little learning occurs.  The curriculum needs to be numbed down, or few blacks will graduate.    <br>
 <br>
We have learned that thoroughly enough with blacks who have lived in this country for generations.  <br>
 <br>
It is lunacy to import blacks from a country which, since it achieved independence in 1804, has indicated that blacks have difficulty creating civilized societies without white leadership.   <br>

<p>1,210 are HIV positive<br>
25,850 are illiterate<br>
27,500 have an IQ below the cutoff for mentally retarded (70)</p>

		<p>According to the ancestry background given on epodunk.com, this city is overwhelmingly peopled by American blacks, Haitians (already 20%) and &#8220;non-Hispanic West Indians&#8221;.  The mayor probably figures the more Haitians, the more votes for him.  It must be a sinkhole already.</p>

<p> That&rsquo;s HIGHLY debatable, but one thing for certain is that they WILL be a burden to any surrounding communities, especially the White ones. Only an African mind could reason that adding FIFTY-FIVE THOUSAND illiterate poor people to a 60,000 resident town would not be a burden. Of course I&rsquo;m sure ol&#8216;&#8220;Pierre&#8221; is counting on and will receive a ton of financial aid from guilt-ridden White folks afraid of being called &#8220;racisss&#8221; if they refuse to help these &#8220;oppressed refugees&#8221;.  </p>

<p>I was astonished to read this.   Initially,  I confused this city, North Miami, with North Miami Beach.  I had thought the latter was well to do and largely Jewish, with many retirees.  I had to look them up. </p>
<p>No, North Miami is a different place, and it is overwhelmingly non-white. And largely Haitian already.  However, on further checking, it seems that North Miami Beach is no longer so well to do or white either.  Both are in bad shape, and heavily black, but North Miami seems to be worse.</p>
<p>Both are heavily Haitian. No wonder the Haitian mayor wants to bring in more Haitians!</p>
<p>According to the Wiki stats&hellip;.</p>
<p><b>North Miami</b><br>
34% White (only 18% being Non-Hispanic Whites,)<br>
55%  Black  (a large majority of them being of Caribbean ancestry,) <br>
24% of the population are Hispanic.</p>
<p>English speakers were 35% of the population, while French Creole or French accounted for 36%.   Spanish was at 25%</p>
<p>&#8220;As of 2000, North Miami had the second highest percentage of Haitian residents in the US, with 33% of the US populace.  <br>
23.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 29.5% of those under age 18.&#8221;<br>
===================<br>
<b>North Miami Beach:</b><br>
The racial makeup of the city was 21% non-Hispanic White <br>
39% black and/or African American, <br>
Hispanic or Latino  were 30% of the population. <br>
[I don&rsquo;t know if Brazilians were counted as &#8220;Hispanics&#8221;.   If not, the percentage would be higher. Ditto for &#8220;blacks&#8221;, but most Brazilians self-identify as &#8220;white&#8221;.]</p>
<p>&#8220;As of 2000, North Miami Beach had the fourth highest percentage of Haitian residents in the US, with 20% of the US populace.&#8221;</p>

		<p>All white residents in that community have to look forward to is zombies, voodoo, crime, drugs, gangs, car-jackings, rapes, etc., etc. Ask the Down Easters in Maine how the influx of Somalis is working out for them&hellip;.an illiterate, lawless people unaccustomed to flushing toilets are supposed to integrate smoothly into modern American society?!?</p>

<p>The African is afflicted with a disease called &#8220;entitled mind&#8221;, which meshes perfectly with those afflicted with &#8220;white guilt&#8221;.  As we already know, those 2 groups enjoy a twisted, symbiotic relationship that leaves those in Asian countries scratching their heads in amusement/bewilderment.</p>

		<p>His motivation is obvious, he wants to double the population with Haitian voters and assure his position for the rest of his life. He also knows that 55,000 refugees will bring in countless millions in federal aid and he&rsquo;ll be able to pocket a lot of it. </p>

		<p>&#8216;Only the Federal Government can dictate immigration policy&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yeah Hunh&hellip;</p>
<p>The sad part of this is what happens when push comes to shove, the Midwest and perhaps Northeast, there is no food, and these people start to &#8216;migrate&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Look to the Dark Ages and things like the volkerwangerung for what happens when relatively small warbands get that twinkle of wanderlust in their eyes because, golly wally, there is no indigenously grown food and there are no jobs earning sufficient money to import it from abroad.</p>
<p>Nor will it all be a one way condition.  Because we -need- port access and going down through the &#8216;central trade corridor&rsquo; to Mexico is not going to solve the problem.  Nor will Canada.</p>
<p>Someone, somewhere, -wants- a racial annihilation.  A blood war to either destroy us or render us distracted and impotent while other world events are &#8216;resolved&rsquo; without us.  And the extent and casualty totals are being made ever more excessive for want of simply saying -no- to the simple numbers being added to the respective force baselines now being arrayed against each other.</p>
