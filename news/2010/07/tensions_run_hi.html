			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KSAZ-TV (Phoenix), July 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Inside the courtroom, it was the state of Arizona vs. the federal government. Outside the courtroom, it was protesters vs. supporters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton heard two different cases Thursday: the first one filed by several civil rights groups including the ACLU, the second filed by the Justice Department. Federal lawyers asked for an injunction to stop the law from going into effect on July 29.</p>
<p><b>Inside the courtroom</b></p>
<p>The judge asked both sides some very tough questions, but as the nearly 2-hour session came to a close, it became fairly clear how the judge feels about parts of this law.</p>
<p>With Governor Brewer in the courtroom, lawyers for the federal government blasted parts of SB 1070.</p>
<p>Deputy solicitor general Edwin Kneedler, who&rsquo;s argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court, said SB 1070 infringed on the federal government&rsquo;s unquestionable and exclusive power to enforce immigration law. He also cited the damage it could cause foreign relationships.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It appears the judge may have an issue with Section 3 of the law, which makes it a state crime to be here illegally. Federal lawyers argued that that steps on the government&rsquo;s toes.</p>
<p>The judge also pointed out that 1070 contains a severability clause, which means she could strike down parts of the law, not necessarily the whole thing.</p>
<p>It is possible that the judge could, for example, say it&rsquo;s unconstitutional to bring undocumented immigrants to jail on a state crime, but she may be okay with requiring officers to ask about someone&rsquo;s status and turn them over to ICE.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Earlier Thursday, Judge Bolton heard the case filed by several civil rights groups including the ACLU, the Mexican American Defense League, and Friendly House. Their suit claims the law will lead to racial profiling and could harm the people of Arizona.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no indication on when the judge could rule.</p>
<p><b>Outside the courtroom</b></p>
<p>While some supporters gathered outside Phoenix&rsquo;s Federal Courthouse, the majority of gatherers outside the building were protesters.</p>
<p>Armed with drums, hand-made signs and megaphones, opponents rallied to make their opinions heard.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The protest remained peaceful until the end of the afternoon  &mdash;  a group of 7 people parked themselves in the middle of an intersection and refused to leave  &mdash;  and were arrested and booked into jail.</p>
<p>The group was holding a banner that read, &#8220;We will not comply,&#8221; and face charges of obstructing a public thoroughfare. Police say they gave them several warnings and opportunities to disperse but they refused.<br>

		<p>There is no issue with Section 3 if the state follows the Federal law on the definition of &#8220;illegal alien.&#8221;  </p>
<p>From what I understand, the judge had the most pressing questions for the Feds.  She&rsquo;s a Clinton appointee no less.</p>
<p>This article doesn&rsquo;t say this, but the New York Daily News&rsquo;s telling states that Kneedler said that 1070 would saddle ICE with way more work than it could handle.  This is from the same man who said on the same day in the same courtroom in front of the same judge that 1070 infringed on the Feds&rsquo; &#8220;exclusive&#8221; power to enforce Fed immigration law.  If 1070 gets them an insufferable work load, then why wouldn&rsquo;t the Feds&rsquo; &#8220;exclusive&#8221; enforcement in lie of 1070 do the same?</p>

		<p>Why is it, when one of these laws favors the &#8216;silent majority&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s never enforced until after it has been challenged numerous time, and then usually not fully. When a law favors the left or people of color, it&rsquo;s enforced right away and sometimes even after it has failed legal challenge. We see this in the recent supreme court decision that &#8216;struck down anti-gun laws&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>It seems to me the fedgov comes out of this badly, no matter how it turns out. I think they made a mistake by taking Arizona to court. But now if they can&rsquo;t even get an injunction, they&rsquo;ve definitely opened pandoras&rsquo; box. The flood of state laws that will follow this will be overwhelming. The fedgov is in a box if you ask me.</p>

		<p>The incredible thing about this situation is what a complete farce it is.</p>
<p>Arizona never intended to pull people over to check status.  All this is a smokescreen for what they are really doing.  Pulling over mexicans, popping the trunk of thier cars to find all the drugs that are there.</p>
<p>Nobody has ANY illusions about any mexican pulled over and found to be an illegal alien (and nothing else).  ICE will probably be contacted (and refuse to show up for them).  That person will be released immediately and continue their life as a blood sucking leech on American taxes.  They do not want HIM.  They want his brother with the $10 million of cocaine in the trunk of his car.  There is simply no way THAT guy is going to walk once caught.</p>
<p>Arizona is simply engaging in racial profiling (because that is who is doing all the crime) and is heading off criticism with this red herring issue.</p>
<p>Of course, since almost all mexicans are in the US to participate in various ways with the drug trade, this has the side effect of driving them out of the state of arizona.  It is simply not safe being able to be pulled over at any time because the officer sees that you are mexican, when you have large amounts of drugs on your person.</p>
<p>Nobody understands all this better than the mexicans themselves&hellip;..but they don&rsquo;t dare say it.</p>
<p>I could be wrong about that&hellip;..wouldn&rsquo;t it change the immigration issue dramatically if they did?</p>

		<p>Interesting bit about the &#8220;severability clause&#8221; - let&rsquo;s hope that most of SB 1070 survives and goes into effect.</p>
<p>If it does I think we will see many states pass copycat laws. Perhaps as many as a dozen or so will pass such laws right off the bat.</p>
<p>Then the fun will begin as we see large movements of illegals from &#8220;SB 1070 states&#8221; to illegal-welcoming &#8220;sanctuary states.&#8221; </p>
<p>The rest of the country will get to witness quite a case study in different approaches to immigration policy as states like California, New Mexico, Nevada and Texas are inundated with unemployed illegals needing food stamps and free health care (thanks to their anchor babies). Unemployment rates will go even higher and state budget deficits will skyrocket. California will go from already bad to much, much worse.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, states like Arizona will be relieved of a considerable burden on their social services and there will be a dramatic opening up of lower middle class jobs in construction, restaurants, hotels, landscaping, food processing, etc. This will be good news for young entry level workers with high school educations.</p>
<p>As the differences between the states get clearer over a few years time, more states will become &#8220;SB 1070&#8221; states, making the divide even sharper.</p>
<p>Every time the justice system steps in and denies the majority will, it chips away at the legitimacy of the overall system. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope the justice system in this country allows the will of majority the chance to see how this policy experiment plays out. The majority deserves this chance. Immigration policy must no longer be set by the elite.</p>

		<p>Kneedler &#8220;also cited the damage it could cause foreign relationships&#8221;.<br>
That is not a juridical argument, but a poltical one. It is out of place in a court. There is nothing in the constitution which says that the US should always keep up good relations with Mexico (or any other state). The US are a sovereign state and can have good or bad relations with foreign states as they damn well please. That&rsquo;s not the business of a court.</p>

		<p>The AZ law will, on one hand, spook illegals who fear being jailed and losing a few days&rsquo; work.  On the other hand, as #4 pointed out, it will also frighten drug dealers who will lose their dope load, all the money they&rsquo;re carrying, and their vehicle.  Illegals know that cops don&rsquo;t have to use their ethnicity to stop them (and they won&rsquo;t use THAT under the AZ law).  All the cops have to do is have reasonable suspicion that crime is afoot, or they can make a traffic stop because someone is weaving a little, speeding 5 miles over the limit, or have some non-functioning device on their car or truck.  Illegals obviously don&rsquo;t respect our laws, so how often do they have either no license plate, a stolen or outdated one, no driver&rsquo;s license, or some other infraction?  <br>
Pro-illegal action groups are mostly after money, and pols are after Hispanic votes.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve thought all along that drug gang money and/or Arab/Muslim terrorist money and/or Soros is the source being the anti-AZ and anti-1070 noise machine.  So I went back and did something I first did in April, and that is read SB 1070 again.  That there is so much language about drugs seems to prove you right.  Even the parts that aren&rsquo;t explicitly about drug running seem to me that they will have the disparate impact of hurting the amateur pharmacological industry in Arizona.  Meaning that the drug gang money is the major component behind the opposition, with any Muslim terrorist and Soros help being inconsequential.</p>

		<p>In the cemetery at Quartzsite Arizona, there stands a monument to Hadji Ali, AKA Hi Jolly, a Syrian-born advisor to the U.S. Army during the Camel Corps experiment just before the civil war. It is in the form of a pyramid topped by a metal image of a camel. Look it up and show it to the next dusky double-digit IQ loudmouth who claims that whitey is xenophobic and racist to the bone.</p>
<p>In Arizona and elsewhere, all we ask is that immigrants be here legally, comply with the law, and contribute something. The Federal Government in its current form doesn&rsquo;t seem to agree, but the Silent Majority does and we&rsquo;re getting less and less silent.</p>

<p>Adding to 9, I remembered that a few weeks after 1070 passed, 2162 passed, which amended 1070 to help its chances of surviving in court.  It mainly added a bunch of &#8220;shall not discriminate&#8221; clauses, eliminated a fine that would have been opposed for the state crime of illegal presence, those monies would have been destined for a newly created state illegal alien/gang intelligence unit (which will still come into being), and most worrisome of all, eliminates the language that would have made being an illegal alien in Arizona PLUS either possessing drugs, meth precursors, obvious terrorist material or guns a Class 3 (circa 3.5 yrs in state prison) felony.  </p>
<p>However, it did not eliminate the language that made illegal presence PLUS transporting minors by either force of arms or without the accompaniment of adult close relatives a Class 2 Felony (5-10 yrs prison).  I get the feeling that part was put in b/c those minors are being kidnapped for prostitution, and drugs and prostitution go hand in hand.</p>
<p>The big rub here is that all of the above is in the &#8220;infamous&#8221; Section 3, which, as you can read above, is the part that has the highest risk of being knocked off.  BUT&hellip;even if it is, the remaining parts of 1070/2162 (the judge admits that they&rsquo;re insectable, meaning the rest stand if any parts are knocked off, just as an insect doesn&rsquo;t die if you cut off one of its divisions), will still serve to deflect the Latin American drug cartel activity out of Arizona, mainly to other states.  </p>
<p>The big Achilles heel with 1070/2162 insofar as totally squelching the drug trade is that ICE won&rsquo;t do its part, and even when they want to deport criminal illegals, e.g. violent and dope-dealing/transporting ones, orders of deportation are almost always hollow promises, for a lot of factors.

Even if the fed government wins, there are still many ways that the law can be tweaked.  The left never stops &#8220;tweaking&rsquo; until they win, they never accept no.  There are many ways to pressure illegals out of the country.  Imagine all the states, counties and towns filing new anti-illegals laws, keeping the dems and aclu on their toes and wearing them out.  There are many more of us than them.  Whenever a leftie judge rules a law &#8220;unconsitutional&#8221; - back to the drawing board for a new variation of the law that has been tweaked just a tiny bit.  The states and municipalities will be learning from each other.  If something doesn&rsquo;t work they will learn from that mistake and just tweak the law a little bit.  Then they can try other laws that attack illegal immigration from another angle.  They can turn it to their benefit, be like a swarm of angry bees on the backs of the federal government.  Meanwhile the illegals will be having a nervous breakdown, the uncertainty alone will bring many of them to leave the country and tell their friends back home to not bother to come here.  They are the ones who are leaving, we are here to stay.</p>
