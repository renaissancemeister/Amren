<h1><a href="http://galliawatch.blogspot.com/2010/07/russian-reactions-to-grenoble.html">Russian Reactions to Grenoble</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>"tiberge," Galliawatch, July 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>How did the Russian press view the rioting in Grenoble? With more honesty than much of the French press. And with no compunctions about calling the incidents by their true name  &mdash;  race riots. The following is an abridged version of an article posted at Suite 101. There is a warning that the article cannot be reproduced without permission from the author  &mdash;  Dimitri Vivodtzev, hence my decision to abridge:</p>
<p>Echo of Moscow is often considered in France to be the last free radio of Russia. But if France Info or Radio Monte-Carlo had published an article such as the one posted at the Echo website on July 19, they would have certainly received dozens of letters accusing them of being of the extreme-right.</p>
<p>The title alone would have created a furor:</p>
<p>&#8220;In the south-east of France, confrontations go on between African nationals and the local police.&#8221;</p>
<p>Further down in the article:</p>
<p>&#8221;(&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;) Somebody is supposed to have heard the colored Frenchmen shout: &#8216;down with the whites&rsquo;, but officially, the authorities do not use the term &#8216;ethnic confrontations&rsquo; to describe what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another Russian source, rbc.ru, wrote on July 18:</p>
<p>&#8220;In France, African nationals are again burning cars and shops.&#8221; Then it speaks of &#8220;pogroms organized by gangs of immigrants.&#8221; (&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;)</p>
<p>And on July 19, the famous Pravda published the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;The French suburbs are once again in flames. (&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;) The confrontations that took place recently between police and African and Middle Eastern nationals again remind the world of the problems linked to immigrants, who represent as much as 15% of the French population.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pravda even analysed the &#8220;question of the suburbs&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;The events taking place this very moment in Grenoble show that the problem is not yet solved. And those who rule France are not to be envied. For if they increase the welfare subsidies of these immigrants who do not really want to work, that will mean a heavy burden for the taxpayer and would lead to a lowering in the quality of life for the majority of Frenchmen. And then, those who do work would be discontented. But if the rioters were to be severely punished, they would react with more and more acts of rebellion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even other websites more neutral in their position chose their language carefully:</p>
<p>&#8220;The confrontations between the police and the ethnic groups .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; (regnum.ru)</p>
<p>&#8220;Confrontations between the police and immigrants are going on in Grenoble .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; (gazeta.ru)</p>
<p>&#8220;Criminal ethnic groups&#8221; is even used by a Muslim website in Azerbaidjan (news.day.az)</p>
<p>The article closes with the observation that political correctness does not exist in Russia, a social reality that has led to conflicts with &#8220;human rights&#8221; advocates.</p>
<p>In this case, I&rsquo;m definitely on Russia&rsquo;s side. Many French nationalists and sovereigntists, in particular those disenchanted with the United States, are looking to Russia as a kind of &#8220;big brother&#8221; ally. They are convinced that the Soviet past is dead, and that the future of France lies with the Russia that has been re-born, complete with its religion and its sense of national pride. How valid this position is I cannot say, but when you read an article like this one, you realize there may be some merit in it.<br>

		<p>Russia is indeed our only hope, and yet the Neo-Conservatives (fresh from their &#8216;successful&rsquo; escapades in Iraq and Afghanistan) now want to take on Russia as well (provoking them on behalf of the Georgians, whining about how Russia deals with Chechen Muslim fanatics etc). Interesting little fellows these Neo-Conservatives.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if the rioters were to be severely punished, they would react with more and more acts of rebellion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
Not necessarily. Depends HOW severely they were punished. Depends on how much FORCE is used against these insurrections. The West is currently stuck on the &#8220;Girly&#8221; setting when it comes to this sort of thing, but the truth is that were our elites ever to prioritize the safety of their native white citizens, Europe&rsquo;s race riots could be effectively put down starting tomorrow. As numerous and as dangerous as the Muslim and/or black &#8220;yoofs&#8221; of <i>les banlieux</i> may be, they would be no match for the combined might of the French police and military   &mdash;   assuming, of course, that the police and military were actually able to, shall we say, <i>perform at full strength</i>. If they were not hampered by Rules of Engagement that virtually guarantee victory to the rioters. If the authorities were allowed to take an offensive, rather than merely a defensive position. In other words, the police were given a shoot-to-kill mandate. </p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be pretty. There&rsquo;d be a lot of blood. And of course the UN, EU, etc, would go berserk. But the point is: it could be done. And it would be effective. </p>
<p>The foreigners &#8220;would react with more and more acts of rebellion&rdquo;? Fine. Put those rebellions down too. Show them you mean it. The ones left alive will learn a lesson and start to behave. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something we should all try to remember when thinking about this stuff. We COULD end this nonsense tomorrow. We don&rsquo;t HAVE to take this from the immigrants. It&rsquo;s not as if these problems are insurmountable. Our societies just need to find the stomach for it. </p>
<p>Although I guess I should really say, we need to RE-find the stomach for it, because we USED to have it. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Pravda&#8221; (Cyrillic script: &#8220;правда&#8221;) is the Russian word for &#8220;truth.&#8221; That was always a sick joke during the Soviet era, when the paper was the official Communist Party rag. Now the paper is living up to its name, while most of the other Western MSM fade into irrelevance (and wonder why they&rsquo;re fading). As William Shatner noted, irony can be pretty ironic.</p>

		<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read, the Slavic countries tell it like it is when it comes to blacks.  And as for non-Slavic ones, Germany has to have laws to keep people from voicing their true feelings about race!  Just listen to what comes out of Hungary and Austria.  Most German nationals probably feel the same way.</p>

		<p>This is very sad that the whites have submitted to brainwashing that they are sooo bad.  Of course, this will be taken advantage of by low lifes.  Luckily, the Russians have decided not to play the holier than thou game which is regressing the whites everywhere.  The Russians are open enough to let a black man be elected in a Russian town because he showed honesty.</p>

<p></p>
<p>That statement stands in direct opposition to history.  It has always been when governments won&rsquo;t (or can&rsquo;t) punish psychopaths acting as a group that revolution (of the type where a country burns to the ground) occurs.</p>
<p>France could easily address this problem.  Send in their military and wipe out the problem population.  Round up the survivors and send them to anywhere, out of the country.</p>
<p>Far from sparking criticism, such behavior would likely be extremely popular and result in a wave of nationalism taking over the french.</p>
<p>The question is&hellip;.why isn&rsquo;t this done?  If the solution is direct, easily implemented, highly popular with few negatives and overwhelming positives&hellip;.why hasn&rsquo;t it been done?</p>
<p>The reason is pretty simple&hellip;.the french government and institutions were taken over and occupied by forces hostile to the french people.  That&rsquo;s who brought this problem population into the country in the first place.  Burning cars and gang raping french women is exactly the goal they set out to accomplish.  </p>
<p>Most of Europe is similarly occupied.</p>
<p>So is the United States.  The difference is, they need to tread very lightly here because the population is so well armed.  At any time, the population could figure out what is going on (and many have), overthrow the &#8220;government&#8221; and install a pro-white, nationalist system that would then systematically liberate Europe.</p>
<p>The same people are behind the occupation of every single government.  And it is easy to see who they are.  It&rsquo;s an open secret.  Anyone with 15 minutes and an internet connection can gather a substantial amount of information.  Yet, it&rsquo;s taboo to talk about it.</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>This article is correct in one sense.  Russia could become the dominant political force in Europe and gain far more power and influence than the old soviet empire ever accomplished.  They could do this by embracing white nationalism.  Such a move would do what Marxism never could&hellip;..turn the white populations of the world against their governments.</p>
<p>The situation is almost the exact inverse of communism.  Communism denied real social links and tried (with force) to bind people together with artificial ones.  It encouraged highly committed people bound tightly together by nation, to abandon that and embrace a nebulous (and quite frankly fraudulent) tie based on an artificial construct (class) rooted in an economic system (socialism) that was completely divorced from reality.</p>
<p>White nationalism encourages highly disillusioned people who are oppressed, divided and conquered by rogue governments controlled by a small group of a different race, hostile towards them (in the extreme) to band together based on REAL ties (race), resist what is being done to them and reorganize their institutions to benefit their own.</p>
<p>Communism tries to trick people into enslaving themselves.  When they refuse, it uses force.  The very second that force is removed (and it can never last forever), the whole thing falls apart.  White nationalism tries to wake people up and throw off the chains of slavery.  Encourages them to redirect resources away from parasitic others and back towards themselves.</p>
<p>To be blunt, the very second Russia decides to finally embrace white nationalism, the pressure all over the world to follow them will start.  In a very short time, it will become overwhelming&hellip;.especially as it starts to solve racial problems&hellip;.like the rioting in France.</p>

<p>One wonders, if Russia fully realizes the opportunity it might have to split Europe (Western Europe in particular) from the USA and NATO?</p>
<p>On my part, this is a highly speculative (and not necessarily a positive one) cognitive exercise regarding Russia&rsquo;s possible secondary/consolation winning of the Cold War. The USA now languishes in a multicultural sociopolitical coma, with a mulatto &ldquo;savior&rdquo; playing our collective neurosurgeon using a vegetable peeler to &ldquo;make our minds right.&rdquo;  We in the USA, have so emasculated ourselves (racially, culturally, economically, politically, militarily, etc.) to attempt to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; ourselves the rightful and multicultural vanguard over global &ldquo;unity,&rdquo; that we have tragically forgotten that a gelded bull is not worth the price of a quadriplegic heifer.</p>
<p>However, as this article clearly demonstrates from last night here at AR, the Russians have not forgotten certain things the Politburo and General Secretary of the Communist Party dictated about biological &ldquo;transformations&rdquo; and genetic &ldquo;insignificances:&rdquo; </p>
<p><a href="/news/2010/07/a_russian_miles.html#post" rel="nofollow">/news/2010/07/a_russian_miles.php#post</a></p>
<p>This is nothing to say of, their ongoing and warm relationships with the likes of China and Iran.</p>
<p>What kind of world do we live in, where the rope the Russians gave us Americans to hang ourselves with, that they now wish to make a double noose together with us and jump hand-in-hand toward &ldquo;sainthood&rdquo; and into a campfire of fools?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>When are the French going to wake up and realize it&rsquo;s no longer France they are living in?  When the non-French population reaches 40%, 50%, 70%?  At some point someone has to challenge these laws and norms of covering up the racial make-up of the country, education and crime.  The French also has to shut down the border.  The reason non-French people are coming to France is because the French built the country.  They want a piece of what France made.  The French can survive without them.</p>

		<p>I can see the Russian elites adopting PC as they integrate with the new international elite unfortunately. Hopefully the US and the three power centres for evil (Hollywood, NY and DC) will have collapsed before that has the potential to happen but it is a risk.<br>
The backlash in the West internally remains the key for me and it is upto us to win that fight whatever path Russia takes.</p>

		<p>This article reflects the point I make whenever someone claims Putin&rsquo;s system is or will become anti-White. Getting bruthas into politics is just a tactical move to kick US OIL out of W Africa. The Sudan conflict is an attempt by China to kick them out of there too. Russia &amp; Orthodoxy is &amp; always was &amp; will be the beacon of the purest haplogroup R1a Aryan Whiteness forever.

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to point out how many non-Russians actually live in places such as Moscow. I worked with an Afghani who lived in Russia for ten years, and he told me of the millions of Chinese, and others of non-ethnic Russian who exist there. They are not citizens, but rather workers brought in who are supposed to be there for a limited time only. Yet with how corrupt the Russian system is, most stay and have children just like how illegal Mexicans roost in the US. </p>
<p>However, this Afghani left with his family because of how violent it is for non-whites, or in his case less pure whites to live in Moscow because of the roving gangs of racist whites who will literally attack people without any provocation.</p>
<p>Even the police will hassle you, especially if you are a non-ethnic Russian and you have a Russian woman with you.</p>

		<p>  Most of the Russians I&rsquo;ve met over the years have been very race conscious. This is particularly true of many Russian Jews who are living in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn, New York. They feel they are the inheritors of a higher culture (loving Pushkin, Russian Poetry and Classical Music) and bitterly distain black &#8220;Ghetto Culture.&#8221; Most of these pugnacious Brighton Beach residents have lived through the bogus equality of communism, and they can&rsquo;t understand the fashionable liberalism of the earlier Russian Jewish immigrants. </p>
