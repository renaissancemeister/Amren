			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>N.C. Aizenman, Washington Post, July 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the less-publicized measures in the new health-care law, the tax imposes a 10 percent surcharge on the use of ultraviolet indoor tanning beds.</p>
<p>Supporters  &mdash;  including the Obama administration, congressional Democrats and dermatologists  &mdash;  have argued that the tax will raise an estimated $2.7 billion toward the cost of expanding health coverage to the uninsured, while discouraging a practice that increases the risk of skin cancer by as much as threefold in frequent users, according to scientific research.</p>
<p>But outraged owners of tanning salons worry that the levy could deal a death blow to an industry already reeling from the recession.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 26 years of business, this is the worst I&rsquo;ve seen it,&#8221; said Scott Shortnacy, owner of the Arlington Solar Planet as well as six other branches in the Washington area. &#8220;{snip} Our sales are down 20 to 30 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even the Arlington salon, Shortnacy&rsquo;s most successful location because of its proximity to sun-deprived Pentagon workers and Northern Virginia mall shoppers, is suffering. Appointments have dropped from 300 per day, to about 160.</p>

		<p>Record heat in DC, and the people there are worried about a tax on tanning beds.  There&rsquo;s a big ole free tanning bed, it&rsquo;s called the outdoors.</p>
<p>DC, MD and VA voted Obama, so they don&rsquo;t have any moral authority to complain.</p>

		<p>How about a tax on hair straightening and relaxing chemicals,they  cause damage to skin and scalp.I am sure Obama and the dermatological community care about the health of all communities,and want them all to contribute their money to the uninsured.</p>

		<p>The local paper did do a story on this and how it is affecting local tanning salons. No mention of the race aspect, however. In fact, it didn&rsquo;t even occur to me until I saw it here that this is, in effect, a tax that affects only whites.</p>

		<p>Personally, I think it&rsquo;s much more specific than a tax on white people. It&rsquo;s a tax on stupid white people. Tanning beds are death in a box. If you&rsquo;ve ever watched someone lose much of their scalp, part of their skull, an ear, and still little by little die a monstrous, horrendously slow death all due to &#8220;harmless&#8221; squamous cell skin cancer from years of being out in the sun, you would run as fast as you can from a tanning salon.</p>
<p>I love you, daddy.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m against taxes and the Fedgov in general but tanning is still plain stupid. Remember this article about tanning=white trash?: <a href="/news/2008/04/beauty_tanning.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2008/04/beauty_tanning.php</a></p>
<p>However, if you are a white who hates your race I have a great solution for you: You can make yourself look like a mestizo or a mulatto at the tanning salon and 10% of your charge will be &#8220;donated&#8221; to the Fedgov to &#8220;assist&#8221; all those poor oppressed &#8220;minorities&#8221; you care so much about! </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disgusting how many white girls (or are they?- can&rsquo;t tell with that tan) I see with that &#8220;baseball mitt&#8221; tan. I hope they like it when their skin finally turns to coarse leather.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never had the slightest interest in going to a tanning salon but I still think this is unfair.</p>
<p>Were a politician to propose a tax on Afrosheen, Chinese restaurants or Spanish language newspapers every liberal would (justifiably) howl about how unfair it is to pass a levy that only one ethnic group will be paying.  </p>

		<p>Whites should have to pay the tan tax. Its whitey&rsquo;s job to fund health care for all the poor blacks and illegals. Just paying for food and basic housing is NOT enough. Whites have to step up to the plate and realize that they are the bread winners of this nation and that their taxes are needed for MORE illegal mexican families and their illegal children&rsquo;s education, free lunch even in summer, etc. Its time that whites realize that only they can earn enough to pay 50, 60, even 80 percent taxes and still earn a decent living. Once illegals get firmly rooted and there are over 100 million non working black and mexican workers whites will have to pay over 90% of their salaries in taxes. Don&rsquo;t like it? You should be looking for a second job. Only white folk want to work so that means they have to provide for everyone.</p>

<p>More seriously though, the whole system is about taking ever more from whites: money, property, freedom of movement, freedom of speech, jobs, schools - entire cities have been taken from whites!  And it is called &#8220;progress&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>A tax on preventable skin cancer cases seems fair to me.  Smoking is the nation&rsquo;s #1 cause of preventable death, and while the taxes on cigarettes actually exceed the value of the product, nobody except the cancer-stick users are complaining.  </p>
<p>Saxon wrote &#8220;It&rsquo;s disgusting how many white girls&hellip; &hellip;I see with that &#8216;baseball mitt&rsquo; tan.  I hope they like it when their skin turns to coarse leather.&#8221;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more, and you&rsquo;re right about the long-term damage that inflicts on skin.  The UV in sunlight creates free radicals in the skin when UV photons knock electrons off the molecules there.  Free radicals are aggressively reactive and the result is random changes in DNA and proteins; in short carcinogenic activity.  Random changes in a complex system - like a biological organism - are almost never good.  Anyone who doubts me should feel free to make random changes on their television set with a hammer and report back here whether the set works better after they are done.</p>
<p>In addition to being just-plain-ugly, over-tanning in women destroys much of the folate in them.  The result if they are pregnant (or even when conception is imminent) is an increased risk of spina bifida in the baby.<br>

		<p>Georgetown Law Prof:  Tan Tax isn&rsquo;t racist, because it doesn&rsquo;t have the explicitly racial intent.</p>
<p>Apply this logic to SB 1070 and the myriad of lawsuits against fire departments, please?  If disparate impact is taken out of play, then 3/4 of the civil rights industry goes out of business.</p>

		<p>This (and the DOJ BP case,and the quotas in the finance reform bill)ARE the transparency the Dems were promising and boasting of: transparently and clearly racist-antiwhite. Still the powers of denial are so strong that some people refuse to or can&rsquo;t see it.<br>
This tax DEFINES &#8220;disparate impact&#8221;.  Disparate impact when it goes the other way defines racism.<br>

		<p>Indoor tanning is a good alternative to those who live in areas that do not have very many sunny days out of the year, and areas that have a good portion of cold weather, as it takes exposed skin for vitamin D to be made.</p>
<p>Also, not everyone has a private back yard to lay out in the sun.  Not everyone feels safe outdoors,especially if they live in areas that have Blacks and Mexicans, which is almost everywhere now, thanks to section 8 housing vouchers.</p>
<p><br>
Tanning beds are not death boxes&hellip; stop believing the lies of the medical industry.  </p>
<p>The MSM is finally reporting what has been known for years among truly health informed people: that not getting enough vitamin D via sunlight causes&hellip; wait for it&hellip; cancer.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Public advice on suntanning may mean vitamin deficiency risk&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Health bodies to acknowledge need to tan during peak hours – despite cancer risks&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The confidential document, seen by The Independent, says: &#8220;The time required to make sufficient vitamin D is typically short and less than the amount of time needed for skin to redden and burn. Regularly going outside for a matter of minutes around the middle of the day without sunscreen should be enough. When it comes to sun exposure, little and often is best. However, people should get to know their own skin to understand how long they can spend outside before risking sunburn under different conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The wording of the draft document is being seen by come commentators as a tacit admission by Cancer Research UK that it had got it wrong in the past about telling people to avoid the midday sun, to apply sunscreen and to stay in the shade in order to avoid exposure to the cancer-causing rays of the sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>And what about all of the WHITE people who had to work day in and day out as farmers in our not-to-distant past?  I don&rsquo;t see stories of massive amounts of the population back then getting skin cancer and dying&hellip; which they would have done, if you use the reasoning of people who are informed by the &#8220;experts&#8221; in the white lab coats, as they did not have the medicine, lasers, and chemotherapy as they do today.  How do you explain that?</p>
<p>Not only that, but suntan lotions raise the risk of cancer with all of the chemicals that they put in them.</p>

		<p>#17, your opinion is welcome, however, most people who worked as farmers in ANY nation in the past were educated enough by painful sunburns to wear long sleeves and hats. They were covered; thus, little sun damage. The number of skin cancers on ears has jumped exponentially as people in the sun came to prefer baseball caps over sun hats that shaded the entire head and neck. Ask any dermatologist. Statistics, not opinions.</p>
<p>Vitamin D deficiency in humans is caused primarily by those who, for whatever reason, (usually laziness) don&rsquo;t bother to get outside for that 15-20 minutes every 2-3 days required to avoid it AND who also get no vitamin D through their diet - a combination which is virtually impossible in today&rsquo;s society. Almost every food in the industrialized nations is vitamin supplemented. Vitamin deficiency is simply a fabulous marketing tactic.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a real mind bender&hellip;<br>
I spent six months in the Marshall Islands, as part of the government&rsquo;s program to clean up the atomic test sites and give them back to the Marshallese. Is it the sun tan I got there, or the leftover fallout that will get me in the end?</p>

		<p>Hard to say, Glows In The Dark.  Really big H-bombs like those we tested in the Marshalls tend to blow the radioactive bomb debris very high into the stratosphere.  The bad news is that it then gets scattered world-wide.  The good news is that by the time it finally gets around to coming back down as fallout, it isn&rsquo;t anywhere near as radioactive as it initially was (don&rsquo;t be intimidated by the long half-lives of some isotopes; it&rsquo;s the short-lived ones that give up the energy of their decomposition quickly that are the dangerous ones), it has also been diluted by the worldwide scale of its dispersion.  It has been said that &#8220;the solution to polution is NOT dilution&#8221;, but dilution certainly helps.</p>
<p>Unless you caught and ate local seafood while there, and I&rsquo;ll bet it was canned rations instead, your bigger worry by far is skin cancer from the tropical sun.  There&rsquo;s a good reason why folks in tropical climates have developed dark skin, whether that&rsquo;s Africa, tropical South America, Australia, southern India or the South Pacific.  I lived in Australia for 14 months, and never left my flat without a hat.</p>
