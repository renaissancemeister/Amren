			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jaya Narain, Daily Mail (London), July 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It wasn&rsquo;t exactly the dream wedding.</p>
<p>And two days in a cell still dressed in your turquoise wedding dress would probably sap the radiance from any bride.</p>
<p>Andrea Kalejova emerged from custody to face charges of arranging a sham marriage  &mdash;  after she and her husband-to-be were arrested at their ceremony.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old Czech and Abdul Majid, a 32-year-old from Pakistan, were escorted from a register office by immigration officials minutes before their nuptials began.</p>
<p>And instead of a luxurious bridal suite the pair were questioned and ushered into cells where they spent the following days waiting for their court date.</p>
<p>A judge this month heard the pair had been arrested in Manchester for conspiring to obtain a right to stay in Britain for Majid.</p>
<p>But Kalejova&rsquo;s lawyer said the couple had genuinely wanted to marry and they would &#8216;strenuously&rsquo; deny the charges. Their arrest came before immigration minister Damian Green announced a crackdown on sham marriages this week.</p>
<p>He has promised an overhaul of the UK Border Agency and said the government was determined to send out a signal that Britain was no longer a soft touch for those people who arrived illegally.</p>
<p>The number of sham weddings in the UK soared to 529 last year, a 54 per cent rise on 2008 and officials believe the tightening of immigration controls, the economic climate and efforts to clamp down on illegal workers are to blame.</p>
<p>An increasing number of EU citizens are marrying non-EU foreigners to help them settle in the country and enjoy the same rights as British nationals. Last month a 19-year-old Polish bride-to-be and Indian &#8216;groom&rsquo; Amrit Singh Dhanju, 30, were arrested on suspicion of perjury.</p>
<p>Bystanders watched in astonishment as the couple were led away from Oxfordshire Register Office in handcuffs to unmarked cars.</p>
<p>Kalejova was granted bail at Manchester Magistrates&rsquo; Court while Majid was remanded in custody until they appear before the city&rsquo;s Crown Court in September.</p>

		<p>Czech? A Gypsy from the Czech Republic, apparently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of ironical that the &#8220;Czech&#8221; and her Pakistani groom are probably from the same racial stock, since the Gypsies are now believed to have come from the Sind region of Pakistan.</p>
<p>Poor Britain! Still, I&rsquo;m glad to see even a slight effort to limit Pakistani immigration. </p>

		<p>It has to do with the lunatic policy of giving priority to relatives of people already here.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need immigrants, we don&rsquo;t WANT immigrants, and promoting race mixing is horrific and disgusting.</p>
<p>Not to mention that woman stretches the definition of &#8220;czech&#8221;</p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t see the big difference between sham marriages and &#8220;real&#8221; marriages when it comes to South Asians, as many if not most of them are arranged by parents and elders anyway. </p>
<p>Pakistanis in particular almost always seek wives in their homeland and bring them to the UK anyway because they consider Pakistani women raised in the west to be &#8220;whores&#8221; or at the very least tainted and &#8220;unpious&#8221; or whatever. </p>
<p>Obviously the only way to stop these shenanigans is to stop conferring citizenship on foreigners just because they marry a citizen, not just because of the influx of non whites esp South Asians, but the phenomena of Eastern European &#8220;mail order brides&#8221; reflect poorly on us whites as well in my opinion.<br>

		<p>Make it reciprocal.  If an equal number of European brides or grooms are not moving to Pakistan, then the one-way marriage stream is mainly economic migration.</p>

		<p>She is NOT a Czech.  Czechs look German or Slavic.  She is a gypsy.  Gypsies have a monopoly on drug peddling, prostitution, and street scams in the otherwise beautiful Czech Republic.</p>

		<p>If the picture is accurate, this rather brown-skinned woman doesn&rsquo;t look very &#8220;Czech&#8221; to me - nor any other type of European either.</p>
<p>This is another racket that exists by virtue of being in the European Union! Does it really pay for Britain?</p>
<p>PS.  AJ has a good point in that most Pakistani marriages are &#8220;arranged&#8221; marriages  anyway, and have nothing to do with love. So how do you tell the difference?  Also, if they have not actually married (yet), then was a legal offense actually committed?  (What sham marriage?)</p>

		<p>She is definitely a Gypsy (the inconsistency between her name and looks gives it away).</p>
<p>As #1 has pointed out, Gypsies are from the Sind region of Pakistan, which is also the homeland of Hindu Sindhis in India.</p>
<p>Sindhis are despised in India as well. They are viewed as seldom trustworthy with little ethics, and as back-stabbers. In fact there is a popular saying in North India &#8220;If you see a snake and a Sindhi at the same time, kill the Sindhi first&#8221;.</p>
<p>The sub-culture of wife-swapping and swinging key parties is quite prevalent among wealthy Sindhis in metro areas.</p>

		<p>The &#8216;Czech&rsquo; woman is a Gypsy.<br>
In fact she looks ethnically Pakistani - just like her groom no doubt, so the &#8216;wedding&rsquo; was a long-lost reunion of blood.Gypsies migrated from what is now Pakistan 700 years ago.It is curious that they still strongly resemble Pakistanis after all that time.</p>

		<p>The sub-con practice of importing spouses (on a massive scale) into Britain and other western countries, isn&rsquo;t entirely due to the &#8216;cultural contamination&rsquo; hypothesis identified above, but more importantly and subtly it is a means of boltstering sub-con ethnic genetic interests as far as possible.</p>

		<p>She is most likely a gypsy (unless the identity was stolen) but she could definitely pass for a Pakistani.<br>

<p>A very good idea Fred, good idea indeed! It is an idea that would work here in the U.S. too as we are not immune to these marriage antics.</p>
