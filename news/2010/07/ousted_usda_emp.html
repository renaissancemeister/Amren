<h1>Ousted USDA Employee Sherrod Plans to Sue Blogger</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse Washington, Google News, July 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ousted Agriculture Department employee Shirley Sherrod said Thursday she will sue a conservative blogger who posted a video edited in a way that made her appear racist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Speaking Thursday at the National Association of Black Journalists convention, Sherrod said she would &#8220;definitely&#8221; sue over the video that took her remarks out of context. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack has since offered Sherrod a new job in the department. She has not decided whether to accept.</p>
<p>Sherrod said she had not received an apology from Breitbart and no longer wanted one.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had to know that he was targeting me,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Breitbart {snip} has said he posted the portion of the speech where she details her reluctance to help the white farmer to prove that racism exists in the NAACP, which had just demanded that the tea party movement renounce any bigoted elements. Some members of the NAACP audience responded approvingly when Sherrod described her reluctance to help the farmer.</p>

		<p>Won&rsquo;t his attorneys have deposition powers and can grill her on her former racism?   Can&rsquo;t they prove her association with the NAACP proves she is a racist right now?</p>
<p>Whatever she can do to keep herself in the news is good for us.</p>
<p>Go, Shirley, go!</p>

		<p>The one hitch in her plans is that Breitbart didn&rsquo;t have the power to fire her   &mdash;   Tom Vilsack and Barack Obama did.  It was an NAACP event, so the NAACP should have (and probably did) tell both of them the full context, if you want to assume still (which I don&rsquo;t anymore) that Breitbart put up an edited video portion.  If the Obama White House is, as PJB thinks, in a panic about hemorrhaging white support, then it&rsquo;s not Breitbart&rsquo;s fault   &mdash;   Obama shouldn&rsquo;t be pushing so many anti-white policies, though asking for that is about as futile as asking water to stop being wet.</p>

		<p>I hope she succeeds. Look how many millions of dollars that can be made by white nationalist if they can prove that the media often take things out of context in order to smear whites as being evil just because they wish to preserve their race. Oprah, are you listening?</p>

<p>I pretty sure she doesn&rsquo;t have a case, because she has to prove malicious intent, and Breitbart sent the video in its entirety to various news sources.  He didn&rsquo;t just send the most damaging assertions.</p>
<p>Too, a court case could well highlight what Breitbart intended, which was to reveal the cheering by the NAACP members every time this racist black condemned whites for one thing or another. </p>

<p><i>Edited<i> in a way that made her appear racist? I wonder what race this writer, Jesse Washington, is? </i></i></p>
<p>No, Jesse, that wasn&rsquo;t merely edited in a way that made her appear racist. That was out-and-out racism, of the type that would have had any white fired if directed toward a non-white. I hope the Electronic Freedom Frontier or other rights agency comes to the bloggers defense.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got the tiger by the tail there Tim.  You&rsquo;re just not noticing the stripes.</p>
<p>What this is about is the first serious attempt to posit that &#8216;internet media cannot and do not present an accurate, &#8216;informed&rsquo; and (get this) &#8216;non-biased&rsquo; view of the events on which they report.</p>
<p>It _does not matter_ that the video at Breitbart&rsquo;s site is not edited.  It _does not matter_ that whatever was put out on the National Networks was itself not edited by him.  If he -sent- that video in, the anti-racists will construe that to be an act in furtherance of racism.</p>
<p>And thus it won&rsquo;t be Breitbart that is punished, it will be the online exchange of ideas as an unmoderated discussion.</p>
<p>Be _very careful_ of what you wish for folks.  Out and Out Confrontation is only useful when you have the weight of will and perserverance to see it all thru.  Otherwise, you are askign to go toe to toe with that damn tiger in a telephone booth of a judicial system rigged to favor the &#8216;victims&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Enablers follow their own agenda: making sure that there is a continuing parade of victims to &#8216;help&rsquo;.  But the ultimate risk here is policy driven.  Right at the First Amendment.</p>

		<p>I would bet any amount of money Breitbart has the case thrown out instanly on a motion to dismiss if he fights it. Her claims fit into no possible cause of action. </p>
<p>Defamation which I suppose she would claim this is, requires the Defendant make a false statemet about you to others. Showing a video of you actually talking  &mdash;  even under the most tortuous and warped legal reasoning  &mdash;  cannot possibly be deemed making a false statement about you.</p>

		<p>The question is what did Obama say to her? Is he attempting to use this situation for some political gain.I wonder if that conversation could be a part of public record and subject to the &#8220;Freedom of Information Act&#8221;.It would be very interesting and more insight into his character. </p>

		<p>Sherrod doesn&rsquo;t plan to sue any of the blacks involved in her firing, and she was offered her &#8220;job&#8221; back, she plans to sue just the white guy. This is racism. <br>
Has any white ever been forgiven of their &#8220;past racism&#8221;? How many whites have been fired for doing some inconsequential thing such as saying n****rdly at a council meeting or putting on blackface make up. Some blacks are complaining about the words &#8220;black holes&#8221; used to describe a phenomenon in astronomy  A white teacher was fired from her teaching job when she was trying to teach something about slavery to her students.</p>
<p>Anyway Sherrod&rsquo;s law suit will not hold up as it is a point of law long since settled. I won&rsquo;t go into detail here, but you can look it up. </p>
