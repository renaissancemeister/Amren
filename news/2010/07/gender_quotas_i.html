			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Diana Furchtgott-Roth, Real Clear Markets, July 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} Take the Dodd-Frank financial regulation bill, for instance, which was created by merging Senate and House bills. When the Senate returns from recess one of its first actions will be to vote on the bill, which passed the House on June 30.</p>
<p>{snip} What did I find but Section 342, which declares that race and gender employment ratios, if not quotas, must be observed by private financial institutions that do business with the government. In a major power grab, the new law inserts race and gender quotas into America&rsquo;s financial industry.</p>
<p>In addition to this bill&rsquo;s well-publicized plans to establish over a dozen new financial regulatory offices, Section 342 sets up at least 20 Offices of Minority and Women Inclusion. {snip}</p>
<p>The Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the 12 Federal Reserve regional banks, the Board of Governors of the Fed, the National Credit Union Administration, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all would get their own Office of Minority and Women Inclusion.</p>
<p>Each office would have its own director and staff to develop policies promoting equal employment opportunities and racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of not just the agency&rsquo;s workforce, but also the workforces of its contractors and sub-contractors.</p>
<p>{snip} The mission [of these new monitors], it [the Dodd Frank bill] says, is to assure &#8220;to the maximum extent possible the fair inclusion&#8221; of women and minorities, individually and through businesses they own, in the activities of the agencies, including contracting.</p>
<p>How to define &#8220;fair&#8221; has bedeviled government administrators, university admissions officers, private employers, union shop stewards and all other supervisors since time immemorial  &mdash;  or at least since Congress first undertook to prohibit discrimination in employment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lest there be any narrow interpretation of Congress&rsquo;s intent, either by agencies or eventually by the courts, the bill specifies that the &#8220;fair&#8221; employment test shall apply to &#8220;financial institutions, investment banking firms, mortgage banking firms, asset management firms, brokers, dealers, financial services entities, underwriters, accountants, investment consultants and providers of legal services.&#8221; That last would appear to rope in law firms working for financial entities.</p>
<p>Contracts are defined expansively as &#8220;all contracts for business and activities of an agency, at all levels, including contracts for the issuance or guarantee of any debt, equity, or security, the sale of assets, the management of the assets of the agency, the making of equity investments by the agency, and the implementation by the agency of programs to address economic recovery.&#8221;</p>
<p>This latest attempt by Congress to dictate what &#8220;fair&#8221; employment means is likely to encourage administrators and managers, in government and in the private sector, to hire women and minorities for the sake of appearances, even if some new hires are less qualified than other applicants. The result is likely to be redundant hiring and a wasteful expansion of payroll overhead.</p>
<p>If the director decides that a contractor has not made a good-faith effort to include women and minorities in its workforce, he is required to contact the agency administrator and recommend that the contractor be terminated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With the new financial regulation law, the federal government is moving from outlawing discrimination to setting up a system of quotas. Ultimately, the only way that financial firms doing business with the government would be able to comply with the law is by showing that a certain percentage of their workforce is female or minority.</p>

		<p>Ron Paul has wanted for years to audit the Fed, and of course, in the minds of those who advocate this, ending the Fed would be a natural and inevitable consequence, so &#8220;audit&#8221; and &#8220;end&#8221; are basically synonymous here.  Looks like by the time an audit bill could get enough steam to pass, the Fed would fall apart anyway thanks to affirmative action.</p>

		<p>Sign me up for being racially profiled by the Affirmative Action recruiters of the &#8220;20 Offices of Majority and Male Exclusion&#8221;.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t complain. I passionately embrace Diversity. I readily agree that &#8220;we have more work to do to atone for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White Privileges.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Translation: I&rsquo;m a safe White who will go along with the Diversity Multicult in all its authentic cultural expression and unity, but since I&rsquo;m smarter and better, I deserve the top job.)</p>
<p>What? I got the job? That&rsquo;s great, and thanks, but doesn&rsquo;t that mean I&rsquo;ll also have to do all the work that the minority &#8220;opportunity hires&#8221; can&rsquo;t?</p>

		<p>I expect many white males to just lie down and take it, then vote for the Democrats again this fall. </p>
<p>I, of course, have the luxury of a Spanish last name from a long dead ancestor who came here from Spain itself over 100 years ago. I am pretty much protected from these quotas although I&rsquo;m as white as milk in a bowl of rice in a snowstorm.</p>
<p>I wish a Republican candidate would have the guts to bring this bill to the public&rsquo;s attention, but I expect them to be silent again this year.</p>

		<p>This president is a racist&hellip; tanning taxes, neverending quotas, taking from whites to give the blacks.  But it&rsquo;s not like we didn&rsquo;t see it coming; he went to that kill-whitey church for 20 years and still got whites to vote for him.  No one will call him on it, and he knows it.</p>

		<p>Oh, more blacks, Mexicans, and women, that&rsquo;ll fix it.  The &#8220;ladies&#8221; aren&rsquo;t required to wear ties, but hey, just like the news casters who sit there winking at us as they vie for our attention for the ratings, I am sure they and the others will insure greater integrity and safety.</p>
<p>Get those Blue Eyed Devils out! Except I checked on who these people were when the wise president of Brazil made his comment and there was only two white men with blue eyes in the entire group!  Maybe it&rsquo;s the white guys who have been just going along for the ride with the general decline in ethics and integrity in the past 40 years?</p>

		<p>Contrast this latest item of anti-white male fedgov policy, with the article on the Chinese outsourcer demanding 125+ I.Q.&rsquo;s. In the 1960&rsquo;s with the Maoist revolution raging in China, who would have suspected that in 50 years China would be sane and the U.S. in a state of terminal dementia. </p>

		<p>I wonder what are defined as &#8220;minorities&#8221;?</p>
<p>E.g. (Just for one)..are WASPS a minority? <br>
Just what is their percentage in NYC vs. Puerto Ricans, for example?   </p>

<p>Not to worry. I have a sister  &mdash;  in-law that works with government contacts. The dirty little secret is all these quotas  for women apply to minority women, not white women.</p>

		<p>Once again we remain on board the incompetency train to the &#8220;lower regions&#8221; of mankind.</p>
<p>I also firmly believe in diversity, and of course &#8220;whomever is better qualified gets the job&#8221;, that&rsquo;s true diversity.  Quotas are nothing more than mental aids, dumbing down, hiring the less competent, racing to oblivion.</p>
<p>The world isn&rsquo;t impressed with your gender, race, or religion, it wants results and those who can produce the results will rule.<br>
By the way, Jesse, Al, and all politicans will perish.</p>
<p>Keep the faith vote all incumbents &#8220;out&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Educated Asians will pick up the jobs reserved for &#8216;minorities&rsquo;, even though they are four fifths of the world population. Whites, who are a minority, will be discriminated against.</p>
<p>Even a Stalinist dictatorship couldn&rsquo;t operate a fair quota system, because there is no universal definition of &#8216;fair&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>An unfair Stalinist experiment is what we&rsquo;re getting.</p>

<p><br>
I believe this whole &#8220;women and minorities&#8221; thing, has always been a clever way for the enemies of our kind, to use our own women against us, by making them side with color people.</p>
<p>One of the visible resuslts of that, today, is when you see an attractive White woman walking hand in hand with a Black who looks like he just was released from jail, and talks like he was born in a ghetto. The White Princess and Mr Yo-Yo-Yo combination, so present on television and in movies!</p>
