<h1>Immigrants Drive EU Population Beyond Half-Billion</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eileen Shim, Google News, July 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The European Union&rsquo;s population has crossed the half-billion mark and the growth has come mostly from immigration, the Eurostat statistics agency said Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eurostat said 900,000 came from immigration over 2009, while 500,000 came from birth-minus-deaths population growth.</p>
<p>In 2008, Eurostat forecast that deaths would outpace births by 2015 in the EU, leaving immigration as the only source of population growth. The EU birth rate fell to 10.7 per 1,000 inhabitants last year, from 10.9 per 1,000 in 2008, while the death rate remained unchanged at 9.7 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eurostat said the 2009 birth rates were highest in Ireland, Britain and France and lowest in Germany and Austria.</p>
<p>The death rates in Bulgaria, Latvia and Hungary outpaced birth rates, triggering a decline in natural population growth.</p>
<p>The 2009 report also found that:</p>
<p>* The largest population rises were in Luxembourg (17.2 per 1,000 inhabitants), Sweden (9.1), Slovenia (7.2), Belgium (7.1) and the United Kingdom (6.7).</p>
<p>* The largest population drops were recorded in Lithuania (6.2 per 1,000 inhabitants), Latvia (-5.7), Bulgaria (-5.6) and Germany (-2.5).</p>
<p>* There were 5.4 million births in the EU. The lowest birth rates were found in Germany (7.9 per 1,000 inhabitants), Austria (9.1), Portugal (9.4), Italy (9.5), Latvia and Hungary (9.6). The highest death rates were recorded in Bulgaria (14.2 per 1,000 inhabitants), Latvia (13.3), Hungary (13.0) and Lithuania (12.6).<br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t trust these figures (notice it&rsquo;s written in the same format as are American population numbers). Ignoring the increase in life expectancy&hellip; how much of this 500,000 native &#8216;population growth&rsquo; can really be attributed to persons of color who are no longer given the label &#8216;immigrants&rsquo;.</p>

Even though a stable, homogeneously white population would give better economic return in the long run, drawing attention to race changes is not on the EU agenda. They only want growth.</p>
<p>Even in godless economics, the EU is a failure.  Like neo-conservatism, it is only fixated on short term gain. </p>

		<p>Britain, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden &hellip;. these are ALL countries with LARGE immigrant populations, and I have no doubt at all that these high birth rates are due to those immigrants and not to the native population.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get a clear picture of what&rsquo;s going on without knowing where the 900,000 immigrants came from.  What percentage came from European nations outside of the EU like Russia, White Africans, the Anglosphere or European diaspora living in the Americas?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Immigration the only source of net population growth in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it is this same foreign growth that will bring civil war to all of Europe and assure its economic destruction beforehand.</p>
<p>Europe will be in flames just as the US will.  Multiracialism is a receipe for war, turmoil and financial failure.</p>
<p>If you need an example, wait a while.  It&rsquo;s occurring right now, and all of us have a front row seat.</p>
<p>Many people are taking note of just who the guilty parties are whose desire is to destroy white civilization, and a good percentage of them are white and will answer to white law. </p>
<p>And when the time comes, sorry, but apologies or stupidity or claiming victimhood of brainwashing isn&rsquo;t anymore of an excuse than you were only doing your job or following orders.<br>

		<p>Eastern Europe, a local story ~6 months ago. Girl,18 got pregnant by chinese, but then fed up with him </p>
<p>refused to marry him. So instead he married her ~60yo slavic mother. The chinese is long gone now. Departed </p>
<p>for greener pastures of luxurious west europe. Oh, not to mention we had a few cases in last month with </p>
<p>Nigerian citizens trafficking drugs, and another managed to rape  18yo girl(&#8220;Butumba&#8221; was his name, they </p>
<p>were drinking alchohol together on Easter)</p>
<p>if I remember correctly, one of my friends was proposed $4000 for fake marriage with ukrainian. Smile, now </p>
<p>they are comming to you from all sides.</p>
<p>As for the Russia, yesterday I watched Armenian satelite TV. A lawyer clearly explained how to get Russian </p>
<p>citizenship, in 5 years. Looks like there are completely no obstacles to that, except HIV/AIDS and lack of </p>
<p>basic(k12) education.</p>
<p>That is in case you though you still have some places to flight to&hellip;</p>

<p>At least someone can dream. Of course I hope you&rsquo;re right; but I don&rsquo;t think our goals will be met by magic. </p>
<p>For one, I would expect our minority populations to have more offspring when the aid is taken away. Such children would live off of donated white dollars, or live perpetually starved as in Africa.</p>
<p>For two, our masters are not planning to use us for long term economic gain. They are simply planning to destroy us and eat what they can. These are people who delight in destruction. Even if you are right about their purposes, they will not be able to undo what they have started.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to disagree with you, ranger, but consider this added factor:  the longer the politicians and the elites can stall and put this off, the older (and smaller)  the European population will be, and the younger (and larger) the immigrant population will be.    </p>
<p>Old, tired people do not take up arms and  go to war. But young, hot-headed  people do. Which side will have the  advantage?</p>
<p>They better hurry! The clock is ticking.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Tuesday is Soylent Yellow Day&#8221;-Anonymous  I have begun working on a project that parallels my favorite scene in the movie. It`s the one where Edward G. Robinson agrees to euthanasia in return for seeing the two minute movie of how wonderful life used to be. Waterfalls and deer in the forest etc. <br>
  In my own case I am ammassing film clips of well dressed women in sunglasses driving tail finned cars and pushing their shopping carts through clean well ordered grocery aisles along with children splashing in community pools&hellip; you get the idea! Whats your memory of how it used to be?!?&hellip;</p>

		<p>Really, what is this obsession with population growth?  When is enough growth enough?  Does Europe need a billion people pushing, shoving and competing for survival, tearing up what open spaces are left, polluting everything, destroying ages old cultures, not to mention (but I am) impacting the indigenous gene pools to near extinction?  What is worth all that?  Of course, this is the same question for all the world to be asking themselves.  </p>
<p>At some point, the population party will be over.  How bad the hangover will be depends upon how soon we can call it off.</p>

It may be   &mdash;   unless we can muster the intelligence and will power to do it ourselves   &mdash;   that Mother Nature will have to be the one to &#8220;call it off&#8221;.  If so and when she does, there will be no altruism, no pity.  Mother Nature does not care, and all the prayers in all the churches and  mosques and temples will mean nothing. It will be a horrible catastrophe and Malthus will be proven to have been right all along. <br>
