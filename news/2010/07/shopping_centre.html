			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Tozer, Daily Mail (London), July 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For centuries, the great British loo has been a matter of envy to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts of pioneers like the legendary Thomas Crapper, we have long since led the world in comfort and hygiene.</p>
<p>Now, however, that could be about to change.</p>
<p>For most of us, the squat toilet is nothing more than a staple of horror stories about old-fashioned French service stations or the exploits of adventurous backpackers in far-flung parts of India.</p>
<p>But this basic form of plumbing, also known as a Turkish toilet or Nile pan, could be coming to a shopping centre near you  &mdash;  and all in the name of cultural sensitivity.</p>
<p>From next week, shoppers in Rochdale who push open the cubicle door expecting the reassuring sight of a modern, clean lavatory could instead be faced with little more than a hole in the ground.</p>
<p>Bosses of the Greater Manchester town&rsquo;s Exchange mall have installed two as part of an upgrade costing several thousand pounds after attending a cultural awareness course run by a local Muslim community activist.</p>
<p>A familiar sight in parts of the Middle East, and still sometimes seen in France and Italy, the toilets require users to squat above them, rather than sitting.</p>
<p>With one in ten of Rochdale&rsquo;s population of Pakistani or Bangladeshi origin, centre managers say they have been told some members of the local Asian community prefer them for cultural reasons.</p>
<p>The town hit the headlines during this year&rsquo;s General Election campaign when pensioner Gillian Duffy was dismissed by Gordon Brown as a &#8216;bigoted woman&rsquo; when she voiced concern about immigration.</p>
<p>News of the introduction of squat toilets was met by disbelief, however.</p>
<p>&#8216;This strikes me as a classic case of excessive pandering to a politically correct minority,&rsquo; said Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley.</p>
<p>&#8216;We in Britain are rightly proud of our toilets, and the onus is on people who come to this country to appreciate them for what they are.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s absolutely ludicrous  &mdash;  Thomas Crapper would be turning in his grave!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Exchange shopping centre is in the process of refurbishing its ladies&rsquo; and gents&rsquo; toilets, and the changes were made after managers went on a cultural training course.</p>
<p>It was hosted by Ghulam Rasul Shahzad, a retired Rochdale Council training officer who runs courses for the groups including the police on cultural understanding and community cohesion.</p>
<p>A former Labour council candidate, Mr Shahzad received the OBE from the Queen last month for his services to the community and social housing.</p>
<p>He was last year given a Community Crimefighter Award by the then Prime Minister, Mr Brown.</p>
<p>Mr Shahzad took shopping centre manager Lorenzo O&rsquo;Reilly and his team on a tour around Rochdale&rsquo;s Central Mosque, including a look at its toilets, as part of the course.</p>
<p>&#8216;The management at the centre were very committed to improving the service they offered to the community and were very responsive,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;We always work together to understand each other from both sides and find a balance.</p>
<p>&#8216;That is the beauty of Rochdale. That is why I am proud to be a Rochdalian.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the centre said: &#8216;We regularly receive cultural awareness training from Ghulam and when we were planning the toilets this was something that cropped up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As a result, when the facilities reopen next Monday, both the ladies&rsquo; and gents&rsquo; will have a cubicle containing a squat toilet.</p>
<p>Turkish or squat toilets are favoured over flush toilets in many parts of Asia as they don&rsquo;t require expensive modern plumbing systems.</p>
<p>Proponents of what some campaigners call the natural posture toilet claim there are health benefits to squatting, rather than sitting.</p>
<p>Canterbury Prison recently installed one for foreign inmates as part of a Â£17,000 upgrade.</p>
<p>But they are regarded as unhygienic and backward in many parts of the world  &mdash;  infamously, a controversial sculpture briefly displayed at EU offices in Brussels last year lampooning member states depicted Bulgaria as a squat toilet.</p>
<p>Mike Bone, of the British Toilet Association, warned the washing facilities associated with squat toilets could pose a hygiene hazard.</p>
<p>&#8216;We really don&rsquo;t see a need for them,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Space for public toilets in places like shopping centres is already at a premium, and if this is meant to cater for Muslims we would point out that the vast majority use normal toilets in their own homes.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>It is most important too that we understand the TRUE reason why such toilets are needed, from the Islamic standpoint.</p>
<p>There are very specific requirements within Islam as to how the faithful are to &#8220;go&#8221;. Enter into the toilet area backwards with the left foot leading, don&rsquo;t look at the residue, etc.</p>
<p>AND, most important, do not, if you are a devout Muslim, sit on a western style commode. There are ten things a devout Muslim is not allowed to touch, and one of them is kaffir. That is us, the non-Muslim. A kaffir sitting on a traditional commode BEFORE the devout Muslim renders that toilet unclean. The kaffir may have left behind sweat or maybe flakes of skin. A devout Muslim sitting on such a toilet will be also rendered unclean as they have now touched you. The prayers of that Muslim will be made null and void because the Muslim is now unclean for rituals.</p>
<p>Please now, I am not making this up!!</p>
<p>Important that we all know this.</p>
<p> &#8220;and if this is meant to cater for Muslims we would point out that the vast majority use normal toilets in their own homes.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>There are no kaffir sitting on those commodes in a Muslim home.  Us.</p>

		<p>Sorry, I&rsquo;ve used British toilets and they have nothing to be proud of - they physically retain the feature that gave birth to the old-fashioned expression of &#8220;pull the chain&#8221; rather than &#8220;flush the toilet.&#8221;  Their toilet paper is a cross between waxed paper and parchment paper - a college friend typed a letter home on it years ago!  Still, I prefer the Brits&rsquo; aging technology to the Muslim hole in the ground - which I&rsquo;ve seen and been forced to use in even such supposedly modern countries as Greece and Singapore.  Despite the Muslims&rsquo; touting of their supposed cleanliness, these toilets are filthy, stinking holes - but hey, diversity is the greatest good!  </p>

		<p>This is another giant step backwards.  This change, if it&rsquo;s the only type available in public restrooms,<br>
discriminates against folks with arthritis like me.  My lower body is so damaged by arthritis, I can&rsquo;t walk without canes.<br>
If I ever had to squat there&rsquo;d be screaming pain, and I would need strong assistance to staighten my body.  Forget about walking afterwards. Let&rsquo;s hope this silliness dies an early death.</p>

<p>Maybe the British call them Turkish toilets but everyone else calls them French toilets.  That said, Britain is gone.  Of course that doesn&rsquo;t stop them from denying entry to US citizens who want to visit or work there.</p>

<p>Then again, why not get rid of toilets altogether as they&rsquo;re offensive to tribes from Africa, New Guinea and the Amazon who prefer to use bushes and wipe with leaves?   </p>

		<p>Whether squat toilets are advantageous or not depends on the medical condition of the user.</p>
<p>There have been scientific studies conducted which show that squat toilets lead to less hemorrhoids and hiatal hernia compared to regular sit-down  toilets.</p>
<p>Squat toilets are also more hygienic if you consider the fact that many guys don&rsquo;t lift the toilet seat of western commodes before peeing, and your butt therefore does not come in contact with someone else&rsquo;s urine.<br>

		<p>The asians may prefer them &#8220;for cultural reasons&#8221;but they are NOT in an asian culture,they are in an ENGLISH culture,are they also to provide a jug full of water that you must pour over your backside,whilst wiping off the excess feces with your left?how wonderfully hygenic to have to handle change from your purchases contaminated by one of these foreigners who have just used one of these ridiculous contrivances.It is time that they realised that it is unacceptable to attempt to build a replica of asia,within our countries which already have a culture of thier own.if they wish to live in this way then asia is the place for them,not England.</p>

Since muslim will be using the toilets anyhow, and will be using it in their &#8220;style&#8221; that means that they will actually stand on the seatring on a normal toilet, with their shoes.</p>

Signs like the one linked to above is not all that uncommon in places where there are many muslims.<br>

<p>Where the hell have you been? We havent used pull chains or  hard paper since the 1970s.  Get real, please. We might not have much left to boast of in Blighty but we do still have decent civilised lavatories and hygenic washrooms.Until now that is.<br>
 Btw, that council, Manchester City,is well known for its far left affiliations. These are the same people who gave permission for an ancient church  and grave yard to be demolished in the ciy so a mosque and carpark could be erected there. If you look on youtube you can view the destruction  with  your own eyes.

		<p>Dave - sorry for not specifying precisely when I used British facilities - I was speaking of 1980-1982 as a temporary resident, not a tourist.  So you are wrong that you last had lousy facilities in the 1970s, but I was wrong to assume they hadn&rsquo;t vastly improved since then.  By the way, circuit breakers (as opposed to physically changing a fuse) were a new and expensive innovation a few wealthy people had back in the early 80s in England (whereas they were common to homes built in the U.S. in the 1950s).  Are they widespread now, as well?</p>

		<p>This is just the start.  </p>
<p>With whole areas overrun with the Third World, soon all toilets both on the streets, in community centers and in shopping malls, will comprise &#8216;holes in the ground&rsquo; regardless of the sensitivities, needs and preferences of the indigenous White inhabitants.</p>
<p>Yes, we know they&rsquo;re to be found in Mediterranean countries, but we must remember that significant swathes of several of these countries had already long since been partly mongrelized through the Middle Eastern and African genotypes due to past episodes of two-way conquests and empire migrations so these alien cultural influences persisted in those affected parts of Europe and are still evident to day, of course. </p>
<p>In contrast, Northern/Western Europe, North America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand up until the mid-20th century that is, didn&rsquo;t happen to share that older Mediterranean background.</p>

		<p>I guess this shows just how weak and gutless the UK has become, as a society. They feel they have to accomodate Muslim immigrants, so that they may reproduce EVERY SINGLE aspect of their foreign, Muslim life in Britain&hellip; even down to the type of toilets!</p>
<p>This is just incredible!</p>

		<p>That squat fixture shown in the picture is a good deal fancier than others that I have seen, which were just round holes. And yes,  the stench was horrendous. It would discourage you from using them, unless desperate.</p>
<p>And along with what Paula said, they are not for people over fifty, arthritis or not.</p>
<p>I think Jedermann gave a most useful explanation of the, um, uh, complexities of Islam.  Yes, Islam is a religion which intricately mandates how to do every single tiny little thing   &mdash;   and I do mean exactly that.  It isn&rsquo;t what we westerners understand as &#8220;religion&#8221;&hellip; it&rsquo;s a way of living.   Christian churches are concerned with God, worship, and salvation.  No Christian church would tell you what to do in the bathroom, and how to do it.</p>
<p>And, lastly, I have seen persons squatting up on top of the toilet, their feet on the rim.  (They didn&rsquo;t care if the door was open.) Jeddermann gave a good explanation of it. Now I know why   &mdash;   you might contaminate them.</p>
<p>It seems to me that persons so worried about being contaminated by us unbelievers ought not to be living amongst us. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be most sensible?  Why would they subject themselves to all the horrors of living amongst kaffirs?</p>

		<p>I am reminded of my policy when confronted with a pay toilet; I produce the largest mess possible on the floor.  Similar behavior around these squat toilets would make them unuseable.  Enforced dhimmitude is impossible without the cooperation of the public.</p>
<p>As for British public toilets from the 1970s, I retain a toilet paper collection (now framed with a map of the British isles).  It wasn&rsquo;t just the equipment that was bad; the paper was horrendous.  And facilities on the continent were even worse.<br>
