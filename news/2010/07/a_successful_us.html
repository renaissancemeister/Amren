<h1>A Successful Use of &#8216;Familial&rsquo; Matching</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maura Dolan, Los Angeles Times, July 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Frustrated by their inability to find the notorious killer known as the Grim Sleeper, whose DNA was not in a law enforcement database, Los Angeles police this spring asked the state to look for a DNA profile similar enough to be a possible relative of the killer.</p>
<p>In April, state computers produced a list of 200 genetic profiles of people in the database who might be related to the alleged serial killer. Among the top five ranked as the most likely relatives was a profile that shared a common genetic marker with the crime-scene DNA at each of 15 locations that the crime lab examined.</p>
<p>Scientists knew that a profile with that sort of matching pattern indicated a parent-child relationship. To winnow the candidates further, and knowing that their suspect had to be a man, they tested the DNA of the 200 offenders whose profiles resembled the crime-scene DNA to determine if any appeared to share the Y chromosome, which boys inherit from their fathers.</p>
<p>There was one match, and it was the same profile that had shared all 15 markers on the first round of testing.</p>
<p>Excitement swept the room at the state DNA laboratory in Richmond where the match was made. Jill Spriggs, chief of the state&rsquo;s Bureau of Forensic Services, recalls a feeling of &#8220;amazement&#8221; when she learned of the breakthrough: The two rounds of tests almost certainly had located a son of the suspect  &mdash;  the first high-profile U.S. case cracked by a technique known as familial DNA searching.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Familial searching has been done for years in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, but technical, legal and ethical concerns have kept the FBI from pursuing it in the United States, where California and Colorado are the only two states that have embraced it fully. Pressed by prosecutors, California Attorney General Jerry Brown approved familial searching two years ago, and Colorado began using special software to track relatives of suspects at about the same time.</p>
<p>State lawyers had warned Brown that a bungled familial search could lead defense lawyers to challenge the state&rsquo;s entire DNA testing program.</p>
<p>Instead, the ability of the technique to identify a suspect in the Grim Sleeper case, Lonnie David Franklin Jr., who was charged July 8 with 10 counts of murder, has emboldened and thrilled advocates of further DNA testing. They hope to see familial DNA searching quickly spread to additional states.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Studies show that prison inmates tend to have family members who also have been behind bars. When the source of DNA from a crime scene cannot be identified, there are &#8220;even odds&#8221; that the unknown suspect will have a relative with DNA in the database, Bieber said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After an examination of birth records and geographical data showed the offender&rsquo;s father was the right age and lived in the right place to have committed the killings, the committee met again to decide whether to give the information to the LAPD. Again, the vote was a unanimous yes. Spriggs said no one raised objections.</p>
<p>She flew to Los Angeles with Craig Buehler, chief of the Bureau of Investigations and Intelligence, and met LAPD officials in a conference room at Cal State Los Angeles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The familial search cost the state $40,000, with much of the work done on overtime, Spriggs said. She said she and other scientists never doubted they could nab a criminal suspect this way, and that statistically they were due for a breakthrough.</p>

		<p>And what did we end up with?  A black serial killer, something which we keep hearing doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Is it such a surprised that closely related black men wind up going to jail for one reason or another?  Half of all black men in a certain age range in many cities are either in prison, on probation or on parole for a felony.  So cracking this Grim Sleeper case might have been as hard as finding a needle in the haystack before, but once they decided to do familial DNA, it only became a matter of finding the haystack.</p>
<p>I read in the news that Mr. Franklin was arrested numerous times for other things since he started killing, but narrowly escaped having his DNA sampled based on the alleged crimes not being serious enough, and other legal technicalities.</p>

		<p>Well familial DNA searches would most certainly be ethnically biased.</p>
<p>Ted Bundy didn&rsquo;t have any criminal relatives, neither did Jeffrey Dahmer. The average black serial killer (or up and coming wannabe) will have a MUCH harder time ensuring no close family members end up in the database.</p>

<p>NO, NO, NO, a thousand times NO!!</p>
<p>The BTK killer, a whitey, was caught using familial tracking of DNA. </p>
<p>WHY would anyone in their right mind to begin with even suggest that is a racist technique if it saves lives? </p>
<p>Catch a whitey serial killer - - that is OK. Catch a black serial killer - - we have to think things over.</p>
<p>Please!! If the shoe fits, wear it.</p>

		<p>Britain was the pioneer in forensic DNA testing, and has the world&rsquo;s biggest DNA database.For about a decade now every suspect arrested by British police has a DNA sample taken with or without his consent.<br>
 Consequently a substantial proprtion of the male population of Britain is on the database - a fact that has cleared many crimes that otherwise &#8216;would have got away&rsquo; - including the first familial match (a notorious rapist, caught from his sister&rsquo;s DNA sample).<br>
 On consequence of Britain&rsquo;s huge DNA database is that around 50% of black men in Britain are on the database.</p>

		<p>Incredibly, there are fuzzy-headed liberals who oppose any measure that might make blacks &#8220;look bad&#8221; (as though they don&rsquo;t already!)  They want cops to avoid stopping and arresting &#8220;too many&#8221; black men, as though they should hold such actions to a certain quota or should just arrest more whites to make it look even.  They argue for lighter sentences or for all drug crimes to be misdemeanors, so that so many black men won&rsquo;t be disenfranchised.  <br>
As it is, 1/4 of American black men are either in prison or jail, on probation or parole, or out on bail awaiting trial.  I read that in D.C. 85% of black men will be in the criminal justice system at least once in their lives!  And what percent of the American people are black men?  Is it about 5%?  Black women probably outnumber black men, due to murders, and the ethnic percentage is 12%.  Blacks commit 2/3 to 3/4 of robberies and shootings.  1/3 of rapes committed on white women are by blacks.<br>
Senators Schumer and Graham once proposed an ID card that would contain DNA.  Surely, this would be nondiscriminatory, though I know it would be opposed by some blacks and by people who just generally see the federal government closing in on their privacy.  <br>
I once saw a crime documentary on TV about a serial killer in the Deep South.  Of course, everyone thought it must be a white man.  One of the detectives asked a private lab to check for any info that could be gleaned from DNA found.  This lab used racial bases for their findings and determined that a black was the perpetrator.  The criminal was then caught and convicted, and yet a black assistant DA said, though he was glad this criminal was off the streets, he wished such technology would just go away!  </p>

<p>Yeah but that was different, he was already a suspect and his daughter voluntarily provided DNA samples to the police to see if there was a match.</p>

		<p>It would stick in the liberal&rsquo;s craw that DNA sampling and databases will stubbornly show that blacks and mestizos commit the overwhelming majority of rapes, murders, robberies and other crimes with whites being the majority of the victims. However, I fear this familial matching can also be used to exterminate not only whites, but others who have white ancestry. The Jews and non-whites want to erase all traces of our existence past and present off the face of the Earth. It certainly will lead to genocide against our people in the hands of those who harbor ill will, malice, envy and hatred towards us.</p>

		<p>Does anyone recall the fate of the father of the dear civil rights hero,Emmet Till? He was hanged by the Army during the war, for the rape and murder of Italian women. Yep,he was a serial killer/rapist.Ted Bundy had nothing on him. No doubt he had committed many many crimes before he got caught. I wonder about dear old Emmet&hellip;what is it he really did that brought abouit his fate? Just whistle? I dont think so.</p>

<p>He grabbed [?] the girl [21 year old married woman] by the arm and said: &#8220;hey baby, how about a date&#8221;! Then went outside and whistled. This is believed to be how it &#8220;went down&#8221;.</p>
