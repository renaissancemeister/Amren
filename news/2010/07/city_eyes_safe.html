<h1>City Eyes Safe Zone to Weed Out Guns at Future Expos</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Gootee, Indianapolis Star, July 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>City officials already are working to tighten security at future Black Expo events after Saturday&rsquo;s string of Downtown shootings.</p>
<p>Three separate shootings near Circle Centre mall left 10 people injured. Police think that nine of the 10 victims were wounded by a single gunman</p>
<p>Indianapolis Public Safety Director Frank Straub told The Star&rsquo;s news-gathering partner, WTHR (Channel 13), that city officials are working on a plan that includes creating a so-called safe zone used at larger events such as the Super Bowl so law enforcement can search for weapons.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The violence has already caught the attention of national black religious leaders. Atlanta-area pastor, Bishop Eddie Long, released a statement on Sunday calling for cooperation in finding a solution to the national youth violence problem.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t stop the Expo, but yes stop the crime, stop the unemployment, stop poor educational systems,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Indiana Black Expo has a moral and spiritual base that cannot be stopped.&#8221;<br>

		<p>&#8220;The violence has already caught the attention of national black religious leaders. Atlanta-area pastor, Bishop Eddie Long, released a statement on Sunday calling for cooperation in finding a solution to the national youth violence problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here, a black religious leader says that &#8220;youth&#8221; violence is a problem at black expos.</p>
<p>Just in case there was ever any confusion about what &#8220;youths&#8221; always means in other news reports.</p>

<p>This is what we call an oxymoron.</p>
<p>This paper has a policy of not telling us the racial identification of crime suspects.  They literally don&rsquo;t here, but the fact that it happened at the Black Expo means they can&rsquo;t entirely cover it up.</p>
<p>And notice that the city&rsquo;s first response deals with guns, not with blacks.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how the MSM has downplayed this story, just like they downplay all stories that portray blacks in a less-than-favorable light.</p>
<p>This story was relegated to a couple of paragraphs buried on page 16 of my local paper, even though this event occurred right here in our own state. This despite all the amazing things this incident has to say about blacks in today&rsquo;s society.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t an &#8220;expo&#8221; supposed to show off the best that a group has to offer? Three separate shootings leaving 10 people wounded. Yeah, I guess that&rsquo;s about right.</p>

		<p>Remember that it was at the Indiana Black expo in 1991 where Mike Tyson met and then raped Miss Black America contestant Desiree Washington. So these shootings are not the first time that violence has happened at the Indiana Black expo.</p>

		<p>Indianapolis is slowly descending into the same train wreck of a city that we see in Detroit. The downtown admittedly is very nice, but go a few blocks in most directions and you are back in the hood. Even Broad Ripple (which is an artsy area of town) has regular attacks on the Monon Trail. (A old RR line converted into a walking trail that eventually will extend from the downtown to 15 miles north.) </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that the leadership of the black expo is trying to figure out a way to blame this on whitey. The mayor, Greg Ballard, is a retired Marine Lt. Colonel who is married to a Filipino and has two 20 something kids. I don&rsquo;t think the &#8220;he&rsquo;s rayciss&#8221; bomb will stick with this guy. Ballard is dealing with a city where half the population in the area lives outside of his taxing and school districts. Lots of people travel into Indy for work, but they also bail out at 5:00. Most of the doughnut counties have all of the trappings of &#8220;Generica&#8221;, so you rarely need to travel to Indy for anything beyond sporting events, certain shows, specialized medicine, and a few other things. </p>
<p>Indianapolis wishes to put their best foot forward in 2012 when the Superbowl comes to town. Obviously they don&rsquo;t need people opening fire outside of Lucas Oil Stadium.   </p>
<p>The local fishwrap, aka &#8220;The Indianapolis Star&#8221; reports that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting. We will all be shocked when we see the mug shot of this choir boy. </p>

		<p>To Question Diversity (re Post # 2):</p>
<p>Dealing with guns, and not the shooters is SOP for almost all big cities, where things like this go on. They can&rsquo;t exclusively target criminal Bantus, so they have to punish everyone, with a useless gun ban.</p>
<p>I clicked on the link to the story, one that said a suspect was in custody. Surprise, surprise, it&rsquo;s a 17 year old Bantu.</p>
<p>It would have been a bigger surprise, had the shooter been a red-headed Albanian lesbian. </p>

		<p>Indianapolis has always had uneasy race relations. I consider it the most Northern of Southern cities. I believe Indy was even part of the Jim Crow South at one time with separate facilities for whites and blacks. There are still definite demarcation areas between whites and blacks in Indianapolis. White folks in Indiana are heavily armed so don&rsquo;t mess with them!</p>

		<p>They always use euphemisms. It&rsquo;s not a youth problem, it&rsquo;s a black problem. Of course, as is the custom, whites are obliquely blamed for all of this as the &#8220;youth&#8221; are not educated enough or handed jobs enough, etc., on and on. I wonder how much of a government subsidy this expo receives; probably just another glorified welfare program itself.  </p>

		<p>Southern Hoosier - Good point.  If guns were the cause of violent crime gun shows would be veritable slaughter houses.  Come to think of it, a gunshow in Harlem or Watts probably would be.</p>

		<p>One may select local areas, sections of cities or even entire urban conurbations for analysis but suppose this is projected for an entire black populated country, and a well founded established prosperous land at that. May I suggest reading an excellent paper on the subject as much of the material will easily transcribe into the subject of this AMREN story.</p>

		<p>The shooting victims were all boys and men between the ages of 10 and 18, and the shootings took place at 9:30 at night.  What is a 10 year old doing out at 9:30 at night unsupervised?  I would have never dreamed of doing such a thing; just joking about it would have been enough to get me punished.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of an article I read in the archives of Amren. A black murder blaimed his right hand on the crime, since it was his right hand that was holding the gun. Why is it with the majority of the black race it always boils down to PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY? And calling them &#8220;youths&#8221; is no excuse, especially when they are in their 20&rsquo;s and 30&rsquo;s. Man up and take responsibility of your lifes.</p>

		<p> There was one shooting at the B*ack Expo last year. The video of the event was amusing, a street filled with B*acks running one way while a few White officers ran the other way.<br>
 This year there&rsquo;s 10 shootings. The most probable cause: Someone &#8216;looked&rsquo; at the shooter the wrong way. Instant Death Sentence offense among B*acks.<br>
 We could almost take a bet - how many shootings will there be next year?</p>

		<p>If you have a chance, go to the CNN.com (yes, I said CNN) article on this incident.  The author doesn&rsquo;t mention race (except for the imperative of noting that this was a Black Expo), and yet the comments section is surpising and encouraging.  Many many posts from many commenters lamenting the behavior of Blacks.  It gave me some more hope that White people just might be waking up.</p>
