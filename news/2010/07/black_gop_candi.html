			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael O&rsquo;Brien, The Hill, July 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Allen West, the Republican challenging Rep. Ron Klein (D) in Florida&rsquo;s 22nd congressional district, sharply criticized the Obama administration for having allegedly declined prosecuting the New Black Panther Party on voter tampering charges for political reasons.</p>
<p>&#8220;For an Administration that promised a new era in race relations, Obama and the Democrats in Congress have demonstrated that race will continually be exploited for political gain,&#8221; West, who is one of two African-American Republicans running for Congress who have survived their primaries, said in a statement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The die has been cast in this election cycle  &mdash;  Democrats and their liberal progressive socialist allies will continue to play the race card when it is politically expedient,&#8221; West said. &#8220;I demand an investigation of the New Black Panther Party and the placement of it, along with any extremist group, onto the Terrorist Watch List if warranted. If that is not done prior to my taking the oath of office as a United States Congressman, it will happen soon thereafter.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>West is seen as a top challenger to Klein after having come closer than expected to the incumbent Democrat in 2008. Republican Tim Scott is seen as likely to win his race in South Carolina&rsquo;s first congressional district this fall, too. Either man, if elected, would be the first African-American lawmaker in the GOP since former Rep. J.C. Watts (R-Okla.), who retired in 2003.<br>

		<p>West deserves credit for bringing the issue up.  But let&rsquo;s not forget that a White candidate daring to make the same statement would get the standard exorcise-the-demon treatment from the controlled governmedia.</p>

		<p>Oh here we go again.  Another black &#8220;conservative&#8221; speaking out for the interests of White America.  Why isn&rsquo;t a White man doing this?  Do you think maybe the establishment is trying to create a taboo against White people standing up for themselves and instead do it through proxy?  That way it increases the need for integration and diversity because White people will need them to stand up for themselves.  How pathetic.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s true with virtually all black &#8220;conservatives&#8221;   &mdash;   They&rsquo;re faking or feigning some conservatism in order to get ahead in the GOP, because:  (1) The queue is too long for blacks in the Democrat Party, because there are so many, you have to pay a lot of dues before you become someone in the Democrat Party if you&rsquo;re black, and (2) It&rsquo;s very short in the GOP, and the Stupid Party would send them to the front of the line.</p>
<p>That said, if this Allen West is faking, he&rsquo;s doing a great job a fooling people.  Maybe I&rsquo;m being a little bit taken in by his rhetorical skills.  Maybe he&rsquo;s the GOP Obama, except that West is better than Obama in scripted affairs, and way better than Obama off the cuff.  Still, if he isn&rsquo;t faking, I would trust him with no more than a House seat, and ONLY if it&rsquo;s the kind of House seat where someone like you or me wasn&rsquo;t a feasible option, and of course, I would expect numerous bad votes from him.</p>

		<p>Just for the record, FL-22 has a CPVI of D+1, so it&rsquo;s a swing district.  Clay Shaw (R) held it from 1994 to 2006, and Ron Klein (D) from 2006 to the present.  It&rsquo;s marginally Democrat in Presidential politics, so it&rsquo;s the kind of district that will only swing with serious national swings in Congressional control.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly gerrymandered, from about Boca to the south up to Palm Beach to the north.  82% white, 10% Hispanic, 4% Black.</p>
<p>Therefore, we could probably do a lot better in that district.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe a word this guy says.  With blacks race is always first, last and always their top priority.</p>
<p>Look at the conservative blacks during the last election.  Every one of them voted for Obama because he is black.</p>
<p>Blacks like this guy usually are Republicans in order to help bring the party further to the left.  It&rsquo;s a common trick and only the most gullible are fooled.</p>

		<p>I have actually contributed money to Allen West.  There are some good blacks, they are the exception, not the rule but I believe he is a good man.  Also a black can speak the truth without being called a racist by the liberals.</p>
<p>West was a hero in the military and was forced out by George Bush.  That lowered my opinion of Bush even more.</p>

		<p>We know, objectively, that the Democrat party uses black voters as a means to extract rent from the taxpayer. The last thing this party of corruption desires is for blacks to prosper.  We should seriously entertain the possibility that some free men of color now see this also, and are responding in the best traditions of black self help. No one would benefit more that the black community should the Tea Party program of abolishing illicit labor, reducing taxes, spending, and regulation. If a few enterprising black men see the GOP as a better venue for their talents, so much the better. Whites cannot solve the problem that is not theirs. Blacks will have to cast out the evil in their midst. I hope black candidates are emerging in the GOP are the first signs of that.</p>

		<p>I wonder who Allen West voted for in the last election?  I have a pretty good idea and so does the GOP.  The more they parade these black &#8220;conservative&#8221; candidates around the more I realize it&rsquo;s to reinforce the psychological conditioning that Whites are cowards and shouldn&rsquo;t stand up for themselves.  I&rsquo;m no longer a fan of the Republican Party and may never be again but my feeling is if blacks want to participate they can do it in a subservient role at the back of the bus. </p>

		<p>Apparently, black people can never win with some white people here. When blacks engage in civilized behavior, they are accused of opportunism. When they act like Sharpton and Farrakhan, they are accused of hating whites.</p>
<p>The only thing that would satisfy some whites here, would be for blacks to engage in mass suicide. When there are no more blacks in the world to criticize, then we can then focus on more important things, like attacking Mexicans, Arabs, Asians, and other non-black races. </p>
<p>Allen West should be congratulated for speaking out against the racism we are seeing in the Obama Justice Department. It takes more courage for a black to criticize a black Attorney-General, than it would for a white to offer the same criticism. The white lawyer who exposed anti-white racism in the Justice Department, will not suffer ostracism from conservative white Americans. But Allen West will be rejected by black Americans.</p>
<p>It may be true that the queue is shorter for blacks in the Republican party. But there are not too many blacks lining up to take advantage of the short queue, because they have to pay a very heavy price from their own people.</p>
<p>There are some fundamentalist black Christians I have met in the South, who really love white people, and want to be like them. They harbor no bitterness over slavery and Jim Crow, and, in a fatalistic manner, they view the past suffering of their ancestors as part of a mysterious divine plan. But some Southern whites fear those blacks more than they fear black radicals, because of the fear that their white children might inter-marry with those friendly blacks. Those whites argue that if all blacks began thinking like Clarence Thomas, more whites would have mulatto children. And if all blacks thought like Al Sharpton, there would be more black-on-white crime. It is a lose-lose proposition for blacks. No matter what they do, they will get attacked.</p>
<p>It is time we heard more intelligent black voices speaking out against Obama&rsquo;s destruction of the American economy, which is not just threatening the future of white Americans, but of all Americans. This is why I am happy to hear the few eloquent blacks who speak at Tea Party rallies. What Allen West is doing is even more important, because he is speaking out against the violation of civil rights of white people. We need 100 more Allen Wests, who will speak out against anti-white racism. Go Allen!</p>

<p>Well you have to admit the track record is not so good when it comes to black &#8220;conservatives&#8221;.  I can&rsquo;t think of one that is truly conservative or hasn&rsquo;t eventually turned on the conservative establishment; Colin Powell, Condoleeza Rice, J. C. Watts, Michael Steele, Bill Cosby, etc.  They also have something in common.  They want to keep affirmative action, set asides, quotas and hiring preferences intact because they realize they never would have got their jobs without it.  What kind of long term effect would such people have on a political party?  </p>

<p>So your saying we don&rsquo;t have legitimate beefs about black people and their effect on our society or the fact we&rsquo;re being displaced by aliens in our own country?  Our problems are just imaginary and we&rsquo;re looking for scapegoats?  Is that what your saying? </p>

I&rsquo;ve always been leery of black conservative professionals, too.  Besides, even if these blacks did genuinely and privately agree with us, we need to quit finding a token black or hispanic to justify our position. &#8220;Look, we&rsquo;re not racist.  See?  We have a black/hispanic in our Tea Party/Minutemen/GOP.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s getting old and turning away more and more white conservatives who secretly prefer to be around their own kind, work around their own kind, and keep this country in the hands of real, white conservative men.</p>

<p>What we need is millions of Whites to grow a spine and start giving some serious blowback to the anti-racists without having to get permission to speak through a black mediator.  What do black people care about Obama destroying the economy?  Everything he does benefits blacks in some way.  Free health care, preferences for black enrollment in colleges, medical school, having the DOJ turn a blind eye to racial discrimination against Whites, taxing White people to pay for more welfare, food stamps and section 8 housing, etc.  Mo&rsquo; money, mo&rsquo; money, mo&rsquo; money.  It&rsquo;s time for whitey to go to the polls with the same racial zeal that blacks embrace and deliver a far right political smackdown that only 80 percent of the electorate can deliver.     </p>

<p>The track record of white conservatives is even worse than that of black conservatives. No people in America have done more to betray white people, than white conservatives. White liberals never pretended to be on the side of whites. But white conservatives get into office on a platform of supporting white interests, but they later turn around and stab whites in the back. It is this betrayal of white people by conservatives that has made the existence of American Renaissance necessary. It was GW Bush and Jeb Bush who saved affirmative action, both nationwide and in Florida. Why are you holding black conservatives to a different standard from white conservatives? Some black conservatives are RINOS, but so are many white conservatives.<br>
 <br>
The national leader of the campaign against race-based affirmative action is Ward Connerly. Can you name any white conservative that has a record of opposition to affirmative action that matches Ward Connerly? Connerly has had real successes in many statewide ballot initiatives, while facing opposition from white Republicans like Jeb Bush and Jack Kemp. Can you name any Supreme Court Justice who opposes affirmative action more passionately than Clarence Thomas? Can you name any white scholar who defends Western Civilization with as much eloquence as Thomas Sowell? Sowell has also been consistent in opposing affirmative action. Can you name any white person who has exposed the corrupt black civil rights leadership like Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson? Can you name any white who defends American taxpayers with as much passion as Alan Keyes and Walter Williams? </p>
<p>[So your saying we don&rsquo;t have legitimate beefs about black people and their effect on our society or the fact we&rsquo;re being displaced by aliens in our own country?]</p>
<p>The beefs you have against most black people are legitimate. And to clarify, I do not want more third world aliens to come to America, and those that are here illegally should be sent back home.</p>
<p>It is perfectly legitimate to attack black people when they behave in an uncivilized fashion. But what is the point of attacking black people who do the right thing? What incentive will there be for blacks to do the right thing, when they are attacked, no matter what they say or do? Allen West is speaking out on behalf of the civil rights of white people, which are being violated by a black President and black Attorney-General. How can any pro-white person who supports the rights of white people, attack Allen West, when he is doing the job that many white conservatives are failing to do? It is bad enough that Allen West has to face attacks from his own black people and from white liberals. When white conservatives here join the left in attacking Allen West, what hope is there for America?</p>

		<p>DLCopeland, there is some truth in what you say about White conservatives betraying their own but that is only because they weren&rsquo;t real conservatives to begin with.  The whole problem with pro-White politics is that it&rsquo;s saturated with fakes and phonies including a number of black trojan horses.  The neoconservative fake right is indistinguishable from the left in it&rsquo;s multicultural agenda and keeping blacks joined at the hip with White America.  </p>

<p>The problem is, when dealing with blacks, it&rsquo;s damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Blacks will complain about high crime in their communties and say the police don&rsquo;t care about blacks. If the police go into a black community, they&rsquo;re acused of harassing blacks and being racists.</p>
<p>They demanded integrated schools. When that didn&rsquo;t achieve academic equality, they demanded school lunches and breakfasts. Then they wanted black teachers. Black administrators. Black principles. Black majority school boards. More money.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what we do because nothing works.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is while blacks blame us for all their problems, they do everything they can to be around us.</p>

<p>Conservatives have become more street smart to the ravings of the liberal left.  If they&rsquo;re attacking Allen West it&rsquo;s only to make the conservatives rally around him.  Political affiliations are secondary to ramming a multicult diversity agenda down the throats of White America.  Indeed, what hope is there for a dysfunctional multicultural America when Whites don&rsquo;t take the bait? </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever heard anybody here accuse blacks who engage in civilized behavior as opportunists.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve heard of too many whites who are so naive they eagerly applaud everything some black does that is the norm for most whites.</p>
<p>The white race has been nearly destroyed by the likes of white people who are too unsophisticated to know when our enemies are just trying to trick us into accepting them so they can gain some advantage over us or water down our group into becoming too lax with people who are insincere.</p>
<p>In the past in this country, it has caused many whites to have been tortured and killed by the Indians, and in South Africa it has resulted in mass slaughter of whites who were fooled into believing the blacks there were willing to accept them.</p>
<p>Will we forever be burdened with the likes of do-gooders?</p>
<p>When this country reforms along racial lines after the economic melt down and the resulting chaos and we are free to set up our own enclave, we must be careful to disallow citizenship to do-gooder whites.  They&rsquo;ll get us all killed in the end if we don&rsquo;t cast them out of our ranks.<br>

		<p>How about White football coaches exploiting blacks by sound all surprised up &#8216;en heahr when the players jess be kepp&rsquo;n it real?</p>
<p>I really feel for White football coaches.  They know that every next phone call will probably be news about one of their &#8220;promising young stars&#8221; who just couldn&rsquo;t comprehend that &#8220;acting out&#8221; actually has consequences.  </p>
<p>After years of coddling and mentoring the blacks, it all comes crashing down on the head of head Whitey coach and he has to same something tough that just ends up making him look like a chump for ever expecting anything from them other than what he got:</p>
<p>re Dontavious and Taverres, who turned out to not be White!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed in their decision-making and lack of judgment,  and they will both pay a stiff price,&rdquo; Richt said in a statement. &ldquo;All our players need to understand that it&rsquo;s a privilege to be a Bulldog, and their conduct needs to reflect the standards we expect.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Our people grew up in an Ice Age world where, to control the deleterious effects of inbreeding (something that is actually more rife in Africa than among North Europeans, nobody knows why), a man established a reputation as a kind of personal history and that reputation allowed him access to the social resources of other HG bands/groups at a time when such were precious.  Either as an outsider, trading.  Or as an adoptee.</p>
<p>Ironically, this dependence on the _unrelated_ group (not a family) is what gave rise to the birth of individualism.  Because as Paine once said: &#8216;It is harder to get character back than to keep it.&rsquo;, having a conscientious understanding of your action&rsquo;s effects on others became a Darwinian selective trait.</p>
<p>In ALL other parts of the world: Asia, Africa, the Middle East, concentration of resources remained squarely centered upon a family oriented, &#8216;right or wrong&rsquo; bias of blood kinship and has lead to social as well as physical inbreeding evident in lower IQs and a lack of both technical prowess and conceptualized universal morality as a social springboard to &#8216;greater things&rsquo; in the modern world.</p>
<p>We cannot condemn those &#8216;do gooders&rsquo; who are merely hyper-expressive of the gift that has made us all greatly admired and envied. Rather, we must _remission their proselyty_ towards more intra-culturally directed goals that reflect what white society can achieve when we apply a conscientious understanding of our social obligations to those who can, innately, understand it&rsquo;s value.</p>
<p>I do not believe that Blacks and Hispanics or even Asians have this capability.  They &#8216;get&rsquo; the payoffs.  But not the process.  And thus they form unassimilable cultural monoblocs within our society, fragmenting us to their own benefit.</p>
<p>And yes, isolation and reinvention of our own conceptual identity, without the neurotic need to project it on others, is likely the key to rediscovery of The White Folkway without having to weed out a bunch of wannabe transracial immitators.*</p>
<p>We are not the same.  We should not look for or force similarity of outlook as a means to accept &#8216;equality&rsquo;.</p>
<p>That is the first, biggest, lesson to incorporate.  All humans have identity &#8216;modules&rsquo; based on a heritable survival strategy that has worked for millenia in specific environmetns and knowing what those are as a function of not tripping them exploitatively or unconsciously is probably lesson #2.  Lesson #3 has to be that it&rsquo;s okay to be comfortable at ALL levels, mental and physical, around your own traditions -as- genes.</p>

		<p>Only 1 thing I admire about blacks is their sense of racial loyalty in the voting booth. If you have a predominately black district with a black candidate running against a White, the black will get overwhelming support.  The qualifications don&rsquo;t matter, the lack of education, the issues, scandals, even a prison record doesn&rsquo;t matter.  The guy could stroll down to City Hall in nothing but a pair of lace panties and pasties while taking a hit off a crack pipe and he&rsquo;d still win the black vote.  White America needs to develop it&rsquo;s own sense of racial loyalty that we seem to have lost over the past 40 years.  Voting for black candidates so that they can be your voice is suicidal at best in these changing times. </p>

		<p>Disgusted, Frank, DLCopeland :</p>
<p>You three are right on target. The fact is that too many of our fellow Whites are whistling in the dark and are suffering from a perverse form of cognitive dissonance. </p>
<p>Rather than acknowledging the fact that many of our problems are the result of greedy, arrogant, race-traitorous behavior of our White politicians, the White elite and other enemies of our people, (mostly White),many of our brethern have found it easier to </p>
<p>* spend time wallowing in denial, arguing about irrelveant statistics on IQ tests</p>
<p>* overstating the amount of interracial marriages between Whites and Blacks and Whites and Hispanics when statistics show that the amount of actual marriages is very low. In fact, the majority of racial miscegenation takes place between Whites and Asians and more specifcally, White Males and Asian females</p>
<p>* Blaming American unemployment of Blacks and Hispanics when in fact it was the White elite and American corporations who opened the borders and flooded our nation with illegal immigrants and also outsourced millions of Amercian jobs to India and China   </p>
<p>* Screaming about foul play in the 2008 election when in fact more than 50% of sad, misguided Whites (especially Whites under 40 and upscale Whites) cast their ballots for Barack Obama</p>
<p>* On this post, a number of posters denonucing Black conservatives like Ward Connerly and Alan West as &#8220;spies&#8221; &#8220;opportunists&#8221; &#8220;trojan horses&#8221; etc&hellip; when in fact, as poster DLCopeland has so eloquently stated, these fine, decent Black men have done more to represent and stand up for the interests of Whites than many of our phony, opporutnistic, supposedly patriotic White conservative politicians  </p>
<p>I could go on, but I think you you see what I am saying. The real fact is that we Whites have been betrayed by our own fellow White establishment. This may may not be what some of you want to hear the fact is that it is what it is. </p>
<p>We can continue to go along with our heads in the sand, whistling in the dark and pretending that there are other unseen forces out there that our the cause of our problems and resorting to focusing on side issues and irrelevant topics that may make us feel good on some level, making outlandish statements that deny the fact of who is really messing us over  but do nothing to adress or confront the real problem. Because at the end of the day  when the smoke clears, we can see that we have been bamboozled by our own people. Period.</p>

		<p>Exactly what is the benefit of voting for a black Republican other than White people are supposedly afraid to defend themselves?  If you look at the current crop of black Republicans, not one of them has won a statewide or national election.  Not only do they scare away the White vote but fail to deliver any significant black votes either.  Just look at Michael Steele in the Maryland election a few years back. Also, I firmly believe that if Alan Keyes had stayed out of the Illinois Senate race, Balack Obama would never have been elected to office and wouldn&rsquo;t have a made a run for President.   </p>

<p>Disagree.  I&rsquo;ve lived all my life either across the river from the state of Illinois, or now, and for the past year and a half save a few months, in Illinois.  I&rsquo;m really familiar with that 2004 Senate election process.</p>
<p>Jack Ryan was not the only Republican running in the Republican primaries for that seat.  The second place finisher, and he finished a strong 2nd, was a milk magnate from Peoria by the name of Jim Oberweis, very conservative for IL standards.  Now, when the Obama machine got a judge to unseal Ryan&rsquo;s divorce records, and that embarrassed him out of the race, the custom would have been to slide the 2nd place finisher of the primary into the nomination.  But the Illinois Republican Party didn&rsquo;t want him, because they didn&rsquo;t want &#8220;a conservative.&#8221; Notice they didn&rsquo;t say an extreme conservative, or a far-right conservative, but not a conservative period.   That&rsquo;s b/c the IL GOP is run out of DuPage County country club locker room, blue blood as any state GOP organization can get.  (By contrast, the IL Democrats are run out of basements next to the Union Stock Yards).  So the IL GOPers trucked in the aforementioned half-wit from Maryland, who, in his race, came out for reparations for slavery.</p>
<p>As an aside, this is a friendly piece of advice for any of you thinking about venturing into politics:  There is no such thing as a secret anymore.  Out yourself, out everything, and out it before you do anything else.  If you don&rsquo;t, someone will do it for you.</p>

<p>Hey, your sentiments are not going to change the fact that White people are currently in the throws of losing America altogether along with their ancestral homelands too.</p>
<p>After Obama, White Americans are going to have to get used to seeing non-Whites periodically winning the keys to the White House too, unfortunately.  </p>
<p>Some of these winners are going to prove to be overtly hostile to White interests, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that.  However, if now and again, a principled non-White happens to appear in the running, it would obviously be more sensible to vote for such a candidate in cases where White candidates have dropped out of the running or were non-existent to begin with.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all aware that politics and the election process throughout all of the West is managed and manipulated by the devious Bilderburg Group and <i>their</i> endless list of assorted shadowy associates at national level as well.   This means that this aforementioned lot collectively hold all the ace cards for the moment until the ethnonationalist movements of the world successfully get their acts together and effect their defeat.<br>

		<p>Question Diversity you bring up an interesting point about Alan Keyes and his support for reparations.  Why would someone who calls himself a conservative bring up such a thing knowing full well it would sour White voters on him?  Was he trying to throw the race?  It certainly looks that way.  This buffoon trots from state to state every few years trying to get elected to office, any office, but no one is taking the bait.  Then he jumped into the birther movement to make a name for himself and that fizzled out.  Him and Orly Taitz made a mockery of the whole thing.  Is there any White person out there investigating this serious issue of Obama&rsquo;s birth certificate? </p>

<p>If Alan West is the real McCoy, a true conservative, that&rsquo;s great.

His skin color can and should give us reason to be wary.  </p>
<p>We have enough on our hands dealing with White Neo-Con Race Traitors like John McCain.  It is the biggest tragedy for all White people that White Race Traitors don&rsquo;t instantly change a bright shade of pink for PINKO when they turn coats. </p>

<p>Look up what&rsquo;s recently happened and is currently happening to the British National Party in the UK.</p>
<p>The Equalities Commission is headed by a rabid Black Marxist of Caribbean origin and is practically dominated by Blacks and Asians collectively, and was also formerly known as the Commission for Racial Equality - (their brand of racial equality being strictly a one-way street, ie, for the benefit of non-Whites only, but mainly Blacks, you understand). </p>
<p>None of their anti-White racist tactics are going to stop the British National Party from fighting tooth and nail for the reinstatement and future preservation of the natural and inalienable rights of the indigenous White peoples of the BRITISH ISLES, I can tell you.</p>

<p>Wary about other Black conservatives, yes.  Mr West is a cut above that rabble both morally and intellectually.  He&rsquo;s looking ahead of the game since he knows full well as does other Blacks of his political perceptions that if the White race goes down, so does the Black.  As simple as that!  </p>
<p>Multi-racialism, after all, makes no allowances for nor will it make way for the betterment of one coloured group over another.  Power and supremacy aspirations and goals precludes such considerations.  Demographics is the name of the game in multi-racial cesspits and so is competition.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;We have enough on our hands dealing with White Neo-Con Race Traitors like John McCain. It is the biggest tragedy for all White people that White Race Traitors don&rsquo;t instantly change a bright shade of pink for PINKO when they turn coats.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in it only for the dosh, power and fame.  Mostly, the big bucks.</p>
<p>There will be a turning point where they shall be pursued and called to account by their own racial brethren.  In the meantime, success is a matter of aligning and consolidating co-operation with all White ethnonationalist movements across America and the rest of the world, an undertaking that is already happening as we speak and which, incidently, has already extended into co-operation with non-White ethnicities in their own ancestral homelands who are being betrayed racially and territorially by their own leaders and representatives too. <br>

<p>Well, Rand Paul sort of threw it out there although I was disappointed in his back pedaling but I guess that&rsquo;s the game you have to play in the hostile environment we&rsquo;re in.  You have to be two faced and say something like blacks have a penchant for violence but then in the same breath say MLK was a great man. Blacks are the least intelligent people in the world but &#8220;civil rights&#8221; is more important than scientific discovery, curing a disease or caring for your family.  You get the idea.  </p>
<p>Blacks who vote Republican are averaging about 4-5 percent of the black vote now.  If the point of Whites voting for black Republicans is to draw in more of the black vote then it&rsquo;s not going to happen.  Most blacks receive some kind of payout from the taxpayers whether it&rsquo;s  welfare, food stamps or section 8 housing for the poor or affirmative action, make work government jobs, corporate welfare for the upper and middle classes.  Simply put, black prosperity is dependent on wealth transfers from White America.  Thinking that blacks are going to give up all of this and vote Republican is pure nonsense.     <br>

		<p>There are forces at work which will eventually have a detrimental effect on black politicians.  Inner city areas in many cities are undergoing gentrification and the black populations are dispersed and scattered throughout the suburbs.  Latinos and other immigrants are invading black neighborhoods and eventually taking over through ethnic cleansing or black flight.  Alot of formerly black areas won&rsquo;t be cohesive enough to elect black politicians to represent them.  Like everything else, blacks will have to rely on the charity of Whites to get elected to office.      </p>

		<p>A. Swain, do us all a favor and drop the &#8220;blacks are the saviour of the White race&#8221; line.  The only thing that will get White America out of its predicament is by standing up for themselves.  Some smarter blacks may have figured out and rightly too, that they&rsquo;ve pushed Whites a little too far and are nervous about the consequences.  Pushing some pseudo-conservative Uncle Tom in our face as a way to defuse the situation isn&rsquo;t going to cut it.  If some blacks want to join us in the struggle, that&rsquo;s fine but in the end we are not going to return to the status quo of the last 40 years.  </p>

<i>&#8220;By what process are a handful of blacks who don&rsquo;t represent the vast majority of their people nor have any influence or power in the black community going to save Whites by them voting for them? It&rsquo;s absurd.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re misinterpreting some of what I&rsquo;ve said.  </p>
<p>For example, I did not say, Blacks like Mr West were going to save Whites.  Whites can only do that for themselves by learning to get in touch with their ethnic survival instincts over again.</p>
<p>These instincts have been temporarily diluted due to past ethnic achievements and domination of the cultural, scientific and technological domains of the world.  Today, however, we&rsquo;re being systematically hate-targeted and grossly dissed. </p>
<p>One of the strategies being employed by our enemies is the deliberate elevation of imported less capable and totally alien  ethnicities to positions of authority and prominance over us as weapons of mass destruction.  Only White people can change that.</p>
<p>On the subject of your question about by what process are a handful of blacks who don&rsquo;t represent the vast majority of their own kind, going to exercise power and influence over blacks.</p>
<p>Firstly, by ridiculing, vilifying, demoralizing and ultimately marginalizing the White self-loathing Marxist clique and calling for AND demanding that public taxes be properly re-directed towards the policies and goals of the American Constitution.</p>
<p>Secondly, by hammering home the truth to the black lower-classes and forcing them to face it otherwise they risk finding themselves outcasts abandoned by their fellow ethnic betters and left at the mercy of the invaders and marauders belonging to non-Black ethnicities through which they&rsquo;re guaranteed to taste the real meaning of victimisation.<br>

<i>&#8220;Most blacks receive some kind of payout from the taxpayers whether it&rsquo;s welfare, food stamps or section 8 housing for the poor or affirmative action, make work government jobs, corporate welfare for the upper and middle classes.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Unfortunately, huge sections of the White population also, increasingly the young with the exception of Affirmative Action granted non-White privileges, have also been consigned to existing on state handouts simply because the international financiers have shifted both the fiscal, scientific and technological wealth of the West to the Third World both inwards and out. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;Simply put, black prosperity is dependent on wealth transfers from White America. Thinking that blacks are going to give up all of this and vote Republican is pure nonsense.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The wealth you allude to also includes non-White input too.   </p>
<p>What we must bear in mind is that the White majority is now down at approximately 62% and falling fairly rapidly.  Due to Affirmative Action, non-Whites are being awarded an ever-increasing percentage of available employment opportunities even if many of them are being manufactured by the state which isn&rsquo;t really the point at this juncture.  The point is that non-Whites due to  their being enabled by our enemies, are also equally able to object to the wilful waste of their taxpayers&rsquo; contributions also. </p>
<p>After all, the massive extent of state welfare largesse cannot be dependent soley on the taxes generated out of White wealth, since there would be nowhere near enough of it to go around, in view of the present ongoing and unfettered Third World invasion of the West.  </p>
<p>It is far more complicated than that and involves heavy borrowing from foreign powers with all that this kind of approach entails, ie, eventual bankruptcy.<br>

<p>I suggested that Mr West could well turn out to be the saviour of America, not specifically the White race.  </p>
<p>Get with the times!  </p>
<p>The White race is no longer the epitome of what once conjured up the meaning and vision of America.  You know who are responsible for the passage of events leading to this situation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And this is what I&rsquo;ve already stated in more than one instance.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Some smarter blacks may have figured out and rightly too, that they&rsquo;ve pushed Whites a little too far and are nervous about the consequences.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This is partly the case, I suspect.  These smarter Blacks are able to see the highly probable future consequences of not aligning behind the American Constitution founded by Whites.  They know that distinctly alien non-White ethnicities entertain entirely no regard for the American Constitution at all and are apt to see it as an obstacle in the way of their individual personal goals which will have a most unpleasant knock-on effect on the well-being of Blacks as well as Whites. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, by your reckoning, none of our own ethnic brethren have ever turned out to be pseudo-conservatives and <i>immitation</i> Uncle Toms!</p>
<p>Getting from where we are now to where we used to be prior to the last 50 to 60 odd years, cannot be recovered even by one fell-swoop of all-out White ethnonationalist fervour and loud expressions of uncompromising White patriotism which are going to be interpreted as acts of mad White Supremacism.</p>
<p>Think!</p>
<p>At the end of the day, a period of gradual progression is what is going to lead to our liberation, providing we proceed with caution and sharp intellect.</p>
<p>That gradual progression is only going to be realised through the break-up of the North American continent and a carving out of new territories (former states) in which to secure our overall survival (present and future progeny) and, of course, assured prosperity, at least, for the forseeable times ahead. </p>
<p>It imperative that people get ahead of the trend, as it were.<br>

<p>Uhh, black conservatives and people like Bill Cosby have been criticizing the black community for years and hasn&rsquo;t had any effect. Why would they listen now?</p>
<p>&#8220;The wealth you allude to also includes non-White input too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whites and White owned businesses account for 90 percent of taxes paid in this country.  39.8 percent of welfare users are black and 38.8 percent are White.  What&rsquo;s astounding about these numbers is that blacks are only 12 percent of the population but account for the majority of welfare recipients.  There are other forms of welfare not included in these stats that don&rsquo;t just extend to the poor either.  White America is artificially maintaining most of the black upper and middle classes with their tax money!  </p>

<p>Allen West could be the saviour of America and yet the real goal is the breakup of North America?  Again, why do we need to vote for a black conservative politician who has minimum support from his own people when we can do this ourselves through massive state secession?  Anyhow, White America is alot stronger than you give it credit.  We&rsquo;re 80 percent of the voters in this country and if there&rsquo;s a political solution it will be worked out over time without the need to balkanize the country.  In 10 years the illegal alien mobs will be a distant memory and the green card holders, foreign students and asylum seekers will be deported quietly and over a period of years restoring America&rsquo;s demographics back to 80 percent or more.  </p>
<p>If you think after the Bill Gates affair or the New Black Panther scandal or any of a number of racially tinged events that have happened in the last two years, that White Americans are going to be receptive to voting for a black Republican, then in the words of Laquisha Jones, &#8220;Girl you be smokin crack, lets keep it real&#8221;.  Let&rsquo;s keep it real indeed.  Throw the gauntlet down and vote with the same racial zeal that blacks enjoy.        </p>

<i>&#8220;Why would they listen to a black conservative politician when other conservatives have been doing this for years?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Black conservatives have ever really laid in on the line hard enough in the past because not sufficient of them are prepared to focus on AA <b>and campaign for its abolition obviously, in case in affects their political prospects.  </b></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Uhh, black conservatives and people like Bill Cosby have been criticizing the black community for years and hasn&rsquo;t had any effect. Why would they listen now?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Because they are not prepared to tackle the real cause, ie, AA.  Besides, Bill Crosby and such like are not in positions of appropriate power.  It&rsquo;s the position of power and of being prepared to limit and where justified, withdraw welfare priviliges which is needed.</p>

<p>Are there any comparable stats that acutally state that Whites and White-owned businesses account for 90% of taxes?  I would guess it also depends on who one defines as &#8216;White&rsquo;. Nonetheless, if what you say is the case, I would be objecting very strongly myself to Whites being financially exploited to fund the livings of non-Whites.</p>

<p>A West administration could well be the saviour of America, yes, through decisively getting to grips with the terrorist threat rather than following the present appeasement and kowtowing approach, halting AND stopping the Islamisation of the US, and reversing the suidial policies of the present administration, etc.  But, in the long term, the human rights and survival prospects for White people is bound to continue to come under threat as their demographic majority status gradually diminishes, leaving the only solution which is the break-up of the US.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve already voted for Obama in significant numbers this time around!  The only difference is, he&rsquo;s a Dem.  </p>
<p>The same way the Dems managed to win the White House is open the Reps which, simply put, amounts to the quality of the publicity machine handling the campaign and equally as importantly, the level of campaigning support a party can attract for its running as has always been the case.</p>

<p>It should be pretty obvious that they&rsquo;d have their own states as well. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;Are you suggesting we dissolve the union to create another multicultural country and continue the parasitic relationship that is the cause of most of our problems?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>It would mean creating separate countries out of the former states by either forging some of them into one or retaining their separateness, (whatever is judged to be the best procedure all round, in each instance) which may indeed result in the dissolution the Union.  </p>
<p>The <b>continent</b> would be multi-cultural/multi-racial, but the individual countries wouldn&rsquo;t unless any ethnicity unanimously chose for their&rsquo;s to be. </p>
