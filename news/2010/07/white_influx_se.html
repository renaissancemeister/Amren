<h1>White Influx Seen at Chicago&rsquo;s Elite Elementary Schools</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Azam Ahmed, Chicago Tribune, July 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About three-quarters of selective and magnet schools that are already majority white will grow more segregated under the one-year pilot, which was created after the district was released from a federal mandate to racially integrate last September.</p>
<p>That placed the school district in the position of trying to maintain integration without using race in admissions decisions, a predicament shared by cities across the country. The district released data last week that showed that overall, the racial composition of those admitted has remained steady, but effects at the school level are less clear-cut.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A major reason for the surge in white students at top schools is that the new formula removed longstanding racial caps at these schools, officials say. Previously, white students were limited by court order to 35 percent of students admitted. This year, white admissions went up by as much as 44 percentage points in some cases, particularly in majority white neighborhoods. Many of these schools are among the very best in the school system.</p>
<p>A few schools, like the selective Keller Elementary and magnet Franklin Elementary, are likely to become more integrated with the new policy. Similarly, some largely black selective high schools are slated to see increases in Hispanic students.</p>
<p>But schools such as Hawthorne Elementary, located in the affluent Lakeview neighborhood, saw the number of white students accepted jump 26 percentage points to almost 70 percent of all admitted. At least one majority Hispanic school grew far more segregated under the plan.</p>
<p>Experts say that schools&rsquo; demographics often fall prey to the city&rsquo;s housing segregation. Some magnet and gifted schools in racially isolated parts of the city were already highly segregated. Consider Davis Magnet Elementary in the city&rsquo;s West Englewood neighborhood: It was and remains 100 percent black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The causes may be different in each type of selective-enrollment school, because each has a different admissions formula.</p>
<p>Magnet schools use random lotteries with no testing. Gifted centers and selective-enrollment high schools, on the other hand, require testing for admission.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For selective schools, the issues are different. Forty percent of seats are filled based strictly on test scores. The remaining seats are divided evenly based on socioeconomic tiers.</p>
<p>Critics think that the upswing in white students at selective schools came because the cap was lifted and a disproportionate number of the highest-scoring applicants were white. In addition, students in the wealthiest socioeconomic tier are guaranteed 15 percent of the seats  &mdash;  potentially drawing from the same pool of affluent kids.</p>
<p>Recognizing they had a problem this March, the district opened up 25 seats at the four most competitive high schools for students at the worst elementary schools. Without that concession, which assisted black students almost exclusively, the number of white students would have jumped tremendously, officials acknowledge.</p>

		<p>I note these so-called &#8220;experts&#8221; are blaming housing segregation for the refusal of white parents to send their children to Davis Magnet School in West Englewood. Would these &#8220;experts&#8221; send their own children to a 100% Bantu school in West Englewood? I don&rsquo;t think so. So why would they expect whites to do so?</p>

		<p>While whites in general should keep their kids away from public school this is doubly true of anything with the words &#8220;magnet&#8221; &#8220;gifted&#8221; or &#8220;academy&#8221; in their names. These are all buzz words for &#8220;let&rsquo;s pack as many high acheiving White or Asian kids in a poorly performing urban school to artificially raise the test scores&#8221; All sorts of contortions will be tried to make everything look equal when the real issue of intellegence is skirted around and hushed up. </p>
<p>I had parents who were educationally liberal so I got put in just about every new program that came alone from the &#8220;gifted&#8221; class to the new &#8220;magnet program&#8221; to finally the &#8220;magnet&#8221; high school for my ninth grade year. The gifted program was a great thing for a kid but since you were taken out of your regular classes for two days a week there were things that you missed and had to make up. Even for a &#8220;gifted&#8221; kid this made for difficulties. Another problem with gifted classes is this is where new ideas get started first- there was a lot of &#8220;values clarification&#8221; (in other words break down what mom and dad are teaching at home) and teaching kids to work as a group instead of individuals. We have all heard stories about kids getting poor grades for group projects when the rest of the group does none of the work and the grade is spread out equally. </p>
<p>The magnet schools I attended (5th and 9th grade) were an more of an education in lack of black motivation, intellegence and agressiveness. Being that fifth grade is about when kids hit 10-11 and that black kids are well into puberty by that time I had to face hostility and harassment. About a quarter of the kids in my class were high performing students whose parents got them into the program and the rest were kids who were normally assigned to the school. The extended day program was so unsucessful that the first graders were taken out of it by the fourth quarter and other kids in all grades were removed from the extra classes (school ended at 4:30) since they had less time for out of school activities and homework. At times I was up until 10 or 11 finishing homework and this was 5th grade. The program was so unsucessful that it was not continued for the next year. </p>
<p>For my freshman year I earned a spot in the selective magnet high school. For this school, the racial makeup was strictly enforced- half black and half white (other races than black or white were counted as &#8220;White&#8221;- mostly native American and Asian) All social functions were geared toward Blacks and everyone else was defacto excluded. Needless to say many Whites were harassed and abused and quite a few left to go back to their home high schools. Most of the special classes offered at this school were availible in other schools in the area and transfers were availible. </p>
<p>Most of these schools are also in inner city urban areas so it is dangerous for kids to be out after school or to ride the bus. Plus who wants to sit in a car waiting for a child to get out of school when you could get car jacked or worse. Plus if your kid has an hour or more bus ride each day they are going to be tired and not have much time with their family. Long story short- the names &#8220;magnet&#8221; &#8220;gifted&#8221; and &#8220;academy&#8221; should mean &#8220;Whites stay away!&#8221;</p>

		<p>White parents must instill academic excellence into their children and support them throughout schooling.  Too many white parents think their children can figure it out on their own which is why only about 31% of white people in America have college degrees compared with 80% for Indians.  White parents need to know what colleges are looking for in students and guide their children to fulfill those requirements.</p>

		<p>It has been and will continue to be no secret to whites in Chicago that the &#8220;way&#8221; to go is to get your kid in a decent elementary school, and when the child graduates, exodus to a private or suburban high school. Primarily it&rsquo;s easier on the pocketbook during those years when parents are just climbing upward in income; additionally, logic dictates a &#8220;save now, pay later&#8221; scheme in regards to private high-schooling or the cost of living in a good suburb. Everyone knows &#8220;they&#8221; got the city high schools a long time ago, and it burns their rear ends that whites should have any kind of &#8220;extra&#8221; help on their side whilst maintaining some degree of dominance at the elementary level. </p>

<p>So, let me see if I understand this correctly. They are taking students from the worst elementary schools, which I am assuming are the 100% black schools mentioned above, and putting those students in the four best high schools, which I am assuming are the majority white schools, pretty much because white students aren&rsquo;t allowed to attend school unmolested?<br>
Brilliant.<br>
This ought to go over like a lead balloon.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p><i>In addition, students in the wealthiest socioeconomic tier are guaranteed 15 percent of the seats &mdash; potentially drawing from the same pool of affluent kids.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more concerned about the high scoring yet less affluent white children who are being saved from a nightmare of racial abuse. After all, if children from the &#8220;wealthiest socioeconomic tier&#8221; weren&rsquo;t admitted they&rsquo;d just send their kids to the private school of their choice.</p>
<p><i>Recognizing they had a problem this March, the district opened up 25 seats at the four most competitive high schools for students at the worst elementary schools.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious if they used test scores to determine who got those 25 seats. Or if they made sure the seats went to black students only.</p>

		<p>I live in an urban area in the largest city in the nation.  They tell me my local public school is &#8216;one of the best.&rsquo;  I drove past it a few times in the morning, afternoon and when the school let out to see for myself.</p>
<p>What did I see?  Hoochie mommas with hiked skirts everywhere dancing and doing their thing.  Voodoos shucking and jiving all over the place.  Almost no white kids, and the few I saw looked like trash and they were acting like idiots. Angry, grizzled &#8216;teachers&rsquo; yelling at everyone with bullhorns.  There was no sense of the &#8216;normal&rsquo; that I experienced when I was growing up in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Thank you very much but I just got my kid in a private school and will paying through the nose for many years now.  What sold me on it?  When I walked in for the tour, 80% of the kids were white and not &#8216;ethnic&rsquo; whites either, but normal American white.</p>
<p>They were behaved, interacted like normal people and 95% of the staff was white and were dripping with sincerity and professionalism.  The non-white kids, almost all Asians of one kind or another, were quiet and studious.  Even the few black and Latino kids were obviously from better families.</p>
<p>We whites are taxed twice.  We have to pay local taxes to support the local public schools that are increasingly becoming chaotic hellholes of third world illiteracy and violence, and then we have to pay for private schools to give our kids what we used to get for free when we were in public schools 20-30 years ago, before the third world invasion.</p>

		<p>This policy of having magnet schools with especially attractive programs represents discrimination against whites as they are located in typically poorer black areas of town. Why should white have to travel far to some less safe area of a city to attend a good school with desirable programs?</p>
<p>Always the policy is to make the whites suffer to improve the situation for blacks. I say let&rsquo;s have just a meritocracy in our school systems and let the students go where they can and expel those that are disruptive. This would incidentally spur blacks to higher achievement. </p>

		<p>I would also worry about the lower income White kids- this is the group that has it the worst. Their parents often do not have the funds to send them to a private school and any scholarship money is almost always earmarked for &#8220;minority&#8221; students. If you are going to send your kids to this sort of school and plan to send them to private school for high school I would seriously think about getting them out before they start 4th grade. Even if you only have about a 10-15% black population in the school this is more than enough to cause problems. By the 3rd grade many if not most of the girls have started puberty (age 8-9) and the boys are right behind them by the end of the 4th grade and definately by the 5th. Add to this that quite a few black kids get held back and then socially promoted so they could be a year older and possibly much bigger and stronger than the apropriately aged White kid. Any White parent who knowingly sends their kid to a school that is more than about 25% black is asking for major troubles. Even if you are not a family of means you can certainly home school.</p>

		<p>Jay, I don&rsquo;t live in a large city but rather a large (and purportedly conservative white) suburb where the schools are also touted as &#8220;the best.&#8221;  The closest elementary school is perhaps 40 percent white.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter that the rest of the students aren&rsquo;t ghetto blacks but rather Indians, Chinese, Pakistanis, and an increasing sprinkling of blacks and hispanics; the upshot is that the school is inhospitable to white Americans and the primary emphasis is on multiculturalism and diversity.  My older child stayed in Christian school through 8th grade; the younger may stay through 12th.  Yes, we&rsquo;re paying through the nose, but besides getting an excellent and Christian education, it&rsquo;s the only place (besides church) where they see other white kids (and I can pretend we still live in America).  I&rsquo;ll say it again, despite the abuse I&rsquo;ll get about it:  home school or private school because public school is de facto child abuse.  </p>

		<p>Get whites into the urban &#8216;community&rsquo; and then trap them with the only reasonable public schooling around, forcing a disastrous demographic shift when the economy is allowed to do another dive and the kinds of suburban/exurban jobs that whites need to keep their families out of this gumbo mix collapse.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it&rsquo;s not just the quality of education.  It&rsquo;s not just the nature of safety or lack of violence and other inappropriate behavior.</p>
<p>Until and unless you admit that you don&rsquo;t want your kids picking up racial traits from those whom you are _not comfortable with_ yourself, on a RACIAL basis, those who recognize your emotions better than you do will always be able to build a head-down, shame faced, case against you.</p>
<p>You have to admit it before the R-word loses it&rsquo;s power over you.</p>

<p><br>
The comparison can&rsquo;t really be done. Certain minority immigrant groups like the Chinese and Indians are a selected group not representative of their origin populations; on average they tend to be wealthier, have better values, more gusto to seek fortune abroad etc. Per capita, America (with its large number of White people) still has more people with college degrees, due to superior educational infrastructure and relative ease of access to higher education, than most countries in the world.  </p>
