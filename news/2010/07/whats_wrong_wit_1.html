			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Advance Indiana, July 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Today&rsquo;s [Indianapolis] Star had this photo of Mayor Greg Ballard, Public Safety Director Frank Straub and various law enforcement officers congratulating each other on the capture of 17-year-old Shamus Patton. He&rsquo;s the person suspected of opening fire during Saturday night&rsquo;s Black Expo Summer Celebration and shooting a total of nine young victims between the ages of 10 and 19 at two different locations before escaping a police net comprised of 500 police officers surrounding downtown. {snip} I for one think they should have all been holding their heads in shame for their failed leadership in the wake of this past weekend&rsquo;s milieu.</p>
<p>Nobody should have been surprised at what happened this past weekend. Indianapolis residents have become all too familiar of the news that comes out during the second weekend of Black Expo. This year&rsquo;s shootings make five separate shootings that have occurred at Black Expo since 2006. Downtown business owners dread the coming of this event every year. What could otherwise be a profitable summer weekend with lots of out-of-town visitors becomes one of the summer&rsquo;s worst weekends. Out-of-town visitors and local regulars avoid downtown like the plague during the second weekend of Black Expo. Bar and restaurant owners complain that their employees don&rsquo;t want to work this weekend and fear for their personal safety. It got to the point a few years ago where a number of restaurants actually closed down. Business owners now say they have been ordered by the City to stay open during Black Expo or risk action being taken against them by the City, such as yanking their alcohol permits. Notwithstanding the ICVA&rsquo;s incredulous claims that IBE pumps $23 million into the downtown economy, I challenge you to find any business owners downtown who will back up that claim.</p>
<p>Despite years of experiencing the same sort of violence and general mayhem during this event, Ballard, Straub and IBE&rsquo;s leadership professed shock at what happened and insisted it was isolated from, and had nothing to do with IBE sponsored events. Baloney. IBE lures a mob of unsupervised teen-agers every year to downtown this second weekend by promoting their Teen Bling event, the name for which itself arguably invites the worst elements of the community. When former Mayor Peterson turned his police force loose to crack down on lawbreakers a number of years ago, the African-American community rose up in protest. As a consequence, police have been ordered not to arrest anyone unless they are committing a serious or violent crime. {snip}</p>
<p>What good has that show of police force accomplished? Two separate shooters draw guns and fire on ten victims with police on foot, bikes and horseback and riding in police cruisers. {snip} The second shooting suspect, who waited to take his shot at his victim a full 90 minutes after Patton allegedly opened fire on his victims, has yet to be identified by police and is still on the streets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the case of Patton, he had particular reason not to fear the police. Despite numerous arrests over the past couple of years, including crimes ranging from disorderly conduct, intimidation and criminal trespass to resisting law enforcement, illegal possession of a handgun and evidence of criminal gang association, the 17-year-old was able to go downtown Saturday night armed with a gun. Based on his comings and goings over the past two years, we can assume he served no sentence in a juvenile detention center for committing numerous crimes. Either police or prosecutors, or perhaps both, have failed to deal with this individual with appropriate punishment, which led to him being on the street and having the opportunity to shoot nine young victims. {snip}</p>
<p>Straub {snip} wants to enclose downtown with barricades and only allow persons to enter the downtown district during IBE and other events through police checkpoints after being searched for weapons. He calls this creating &#8220;safe zones.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>If downtown business owners don&rsquo;t rise up in protest for these planned safe zones for dealing with this problem, then they deserve all of the economic losses they will most assuredly incur if Straub&rsquo;s plan is implemented. Instead of removing the problem event from its downtown locale, Straub is simply pandering to the ones who brought about this problem in the first place and who are costing us hundreds of thousands of dollars in extra policing for an event that is known for welcoming only African-Americans, in sharp contrast to other ethnic, community and gay pride events that welcome all and don&rsquo;t require a massive show of police force. Straub&rsquo;s plan punishes innocent business owners, and it punishes the vast majority of Indianapolis residents who object to what this annual event is doing to harm our downtown.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>UPDATE: I&rsquo;m pleased to see that the Star political columnist Matt Tully gets it. His column today is one of his best in recent memory:</p>

								<h2>Time to Talk About Problems Linked to Expo</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Matthew Tully, Indianapolis Star, July 21, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>If the shootings that occurred Downtown last weekend had been tied to the Indiana Plumbers Expo, or one of a thousand other conventions, the follow-up discussion wouldn&rsquo;t be so difficult.</p>
<p>We all respect plumbers, of course. But if their annual convention required hundreds of city cops patrolling our compact Downtown on a Saturday evening, and if shootings and fights and other incidents outside the convention had become all too common, we would question whether the plumbers expo was worth the trouble.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re talking instead about Indiana Black Expo and its annual Summer Celebration. So any discussion about the monumental problems tied to it gets bogged down in the treacherous issue of race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [We] can&rsquo;t let the delicate nature of this subject, or the words of a few racists, prevent us from finally having an honest, and perhaps painful, discussion about the ongoing problems related to Black Expo. Fear of having a blunt conversation, and fear of being labeled a racist, likely has prevented the city from adequately addressing this ongoing problem before now. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about that. Black Expo has a wonderful history and is filled each year with important seminars and health screenings and speeches. But to act like the average person doesn&rsquo;t associate Black Expo with public safety problems is naive.</p>
<p>We have to ask whether the current Expo leadership is up to addressing the problem. We have to be willing to acknowledge that these types of problems have not been associated with other conventions. We have to ask about the expense to taxpayers of securing the event. And we have to ask why this city buckles in fear of offending the National Rifle Association, so much so that it has refused to aggressively tackle the deadly issue of illegally possessed guns.</p>

		<p>Any city that becomes host to a black event comes to quickly regret it.  I wonder how many have simply become so unwelcoming that blacks begin to go elsewhere.  Common sense dictates that businesses would rather have money as not, but young blacks cause so much trouble that no amount of cash is worth it.<br>
Those merchants who are blackmailed into staying open should file a clas action suit.</p>

		<p>A writer for the Indy Star wants to be honest?  The Indy Star was practically the first major city paper to announce publicly that they censored reports about black crime, though most of the ruling class media did that silently for decades.  His last sentence gives away his intellectual dishonesty.</p>
<p>From the first article:</p>
<p><i>In the case of Patton, he had particular reason not to fear the police. Despite numerous arrests over the past couple of years, including crimes ranging from disorderly conduct, intimidation and criminal trespass to resisting law enforcement, illegal possession of a handgun and evidence of criminal gang association, the 17-year-old was able to go downtown Saturday night armed with a gun. Based on his comings and goings over the past two years, we can assume he served no sentence in a juvenile detention center for committing numerous crimes. Either police or prosecutors, or perhaps both, have failed to deal with this individual with appropriate punishment, which led to him being on the street and having the opportunity to shoot nine young victims.</i></p>
<p>And both Federal and (presumably) IN law disallows most handgun possession by those under 21. (Strangely, though, you can get an IN CCW permit at 18.)  Something which Mr. Matthew Tully should consider, with his snark about the NRA.  All the gun laws are useless if your prosecutors and judges are too chicken waste to enforce them against young black men.  (They&rsquo;ll only be enforced against whites, we all know the time of day.)  I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Shamus Patton violated a dozen or more city, state and local gun laws in the course of his new alleged crimes, so this fool from the paper wants more gun laws.  All these anti-gun fools love gun control so much, but moan and whine when they&rsquo;re actually enforced against people who really have no business being nowhere near guns (black thugs), such that the enforcement actually serves to deter future violent crimes (Project Exile), not fretting about some guy on a mountain top in Idaho sawing off a shot gun 0.25 inch too short and therefore incurring a $5 transfer tax he forgot to pay, thereby giving the FBI the right to assassinate his wife, kids and dog (Randy Weaver).</p>

Daytona Beach wised up and told &#8220;black college reunion&#8221; to find another home and saved the city millions of dollars in security and cleanup costs.

		<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that Indianapolis would not have these problems if they just dumped the Black Expo Summer Celebration and replaced it with an annual Renaissance Faire or a Celtic Heritage Celebration.  Businessmen would look forward to the extra business.  Facts are facts, Heidi Beirich.  (I&rsquo;m sure she and the rest of the SPLC gang read these posts regularly.  Come on over and debate us sometime.)</p>
<p>Matthew Tully blames the NRA for preventing the city from cracking down on illegal guns.  Well if the guns are illegal how is the city even going to know about them until it&rsquo;s too late and the crime has been committed?  Is the Indianapolis police supposed to carry out a house to house search looking for them?  Those kind of police state tactics would go over real well with the black community.  I note that liberals who favor gun control are always worried about <i>black</i> people with guns.  We have rural areas in this country where nearly every white guy has a rifle and so does his 12 year old son.  Yet murder is not rampant in such places.<br>

		<p>Sorry, but writer Matthew Tully DOESN&#8221;T get it. He blames the problem on &#8220;illegal guns&#8221;, and the &#8220;fear&#8221;  Indianapolis has for the National Rifle Association. NRA didn&rsquo;t cause the shootings at Black Expo. Neither did the guns shoot those people by themselves.</p>
<p>Not one word from Tully about the suspect with a prior criminal record. No questions as to why he was let out early, and why he had a gun, with a prior felony record.</p>
<p>I have a solution for the businesses who are impacted by Black Expo. Instead of threatening to shut down, why don&rsquo;t the employees of said businesses bring their firearms to work? Those who have CCW licenses can carry them legally, and those employees who don&rsquo;t, can carry them concealed &#8220;on the sly&#8221;.</p>
<p>Indiana is a state which has &#8216;Castle Doctrine&#8221; laws. That means, any person has the right to use deadly force, if necessary, to protect themselves wherever they have a legal right to be. It eliminates the &#8220;duty to retreat&#8221;.</p>
<p>Makes a lot more sense than doing the annual hand-wringing over shootings that accompany IBE, and nothing more. </p>

<p>Right you are. Those problems did/do not exist with the Harley Davidson week, but the city council of Myrtle Beach (a couple of years ago and rescinded this year) passed an in city helmet law (contrary to state law which is why the state courts struck it down) which effectively drove the Harley bikers to adjacent cities, which were all to pleased to have the business. The helmet law cost the city (according to sources) more than 22 MILLION in lost revenue and because of the law (notwithstanding the repeal) bikers (including myself) avoid Myrtle Beach in spite. I missed most of the controversy because I am in the muslim wars (and they are exactly that, muslim wars) and have been here for more than 6 years. When I do come home though, I don&rsquo;t spend any money in Myrtle Beach and won&rsquo;t until the total council members that voted the helmet law are UNelected!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that this debate about gun control is because of the blacks. They are the reason for the gun crimes in the cities, so now Obama and his ilk want to eliminate all guns.<br>
Forty five years ago there were markmanship classes in many schools, and now that is gone along with most of old America.</p>

		<p>Of course, the Black Expo is held in one of the whitest cities in America.  You know they can&rsquo;t be around the ghetto or violence, they need to be in a nice area.  The Black Expo gives Indianapolis a look up close at what black populated areas&rsquo; bring; violence and disorder.  One of the most disturbing things about this report is the lack of enforcement of petty crimes.  Black people through jury nullification have worked to free black criminals of any punishment for petty crimes.  Petty crimes are major reason white people leave neighborhoods once black people start moving in.  The police basically are giving black people free reign to terrorize.</p>

		<p>No such thing as a &#8220;unsolvable problem&#8221;, however there are &#8220;unsolvable people&#8221;.  The reason for this dilemma is simple, we are trying to believe a lie, we are fighting and dying for a lie, and the lie is what we are constantly trying to justify.</p>
<p>Thousands have fought and died for equality, trillions have been spent for equality, government imposed discrimination is practiced for equality, and all for what?  the value systems and genetics prevent equality from becoming a reality.</p>
<p>Cease the lie, face the truth, it will enrich your life.</p>

		<p>   I remember visiting family in Daytona Beach, Florida one summer while they were having a black family expo. Thousands of blacks would pour into the streets and block traffic off completely and dare you to try to drive around them. My cousin works as an insurance adjuster, spring break and any sort of black expo are the most expensive in damage costs. Biker week in February amounts to very little damage compared to either of the other two events.</p>

		<p>When I worked as a waiter I absolutely hated the multiple black conventions which came into town, except for the southern baptist convention. (Not the best tippers, but at least not rude, and obnoxious.) </p>
<p>Aside from the southern baptist, dine, and dash events always skyrocketed when those conventions were in town. We would end up with large parties of: extremely loud, rude to staff, rude to other customers, and obnoxious blacks that would run you ragged, and then would try to walk on the check, play the free meal game, or stiff their servers. I didn&rsquo;t even mind the complain to try to get a free meal game, because I accepted it as a game for most. I never wanted to slight those that it might have a genuine problem with their meal, but some of it was pretty over the top.  </p>

<p>Federal law stipulates age of 21 for handgun purchases from FFLs. However, to purchase one privately or to merely posses one the age is 18. See <br>
18 U.S.C. 922(x). Additionally, most states also set the age for private sales and possession at 18. </p>
<p>Your point still stands, though, since Patton was under 18 and probably violated several other gun laws before he even left the house that morning.   </p>

		<p>Several decades ago, Baltimore was known for its ethnic heritage festivals  &mdash;  Irish, Lithuanian, Polish, German, etc.  &mdash;  held throughout the summer in various locations around Baltimore City. It was fun, walkable, safe, and highly anticipated. </p>
<p>Then came Afram. For a few years, it existed side-by-side with the Italians, the Germans, and the Poles, etc. All of a sudden, permits and costs were raised through the roof, and the ethnic heritage festivals went to surrounding Baltimore County. Afram was always dicey, but not even the high fees could disuade it from existing. </p>
<p>Oh, well. At one time, Baltimore had to cancel its Flower Mart because of &#8220;yoots&#8221; storming through&hellip;</p>

		<p>JT, I can answer your question:</p>
<p>NONE! ZERO! ZIP!</p>
<p>This despite the fact that, at every NRA convention, there are hundreds of weapons, knives and ammo boxes on display. Last year, the NRA convention drew over 60,000 people, and this year&rsquo;s convention drew over 70,000 people.  No reports whatsoever, of any mayhem.</p>
<p>It all comes down to personal responsibility. NRA members are the most safety-conscious people among gun-owners there are. Compare that to a ghetto thug in Compton or Gary, who whips out a gun and shoots somebody, because he thought they looked at him &#8220;funny&#8221;.</p>

<p>The NRA endorses Project Exile (which I slightly ref&rsquo;ed above)/Project Safe Neighborhoods.  It&rsquo;s about the only kind of &#8220;gun control&#8221; I support.  I mentioned it prominently six years ago vis-a-vis St. Louis&rsquo;s &#8220;wonderful&#8221; Mayor and then-Police Chief.  Warning, it&rsquo;s long:</p>

		<p>Every time you get a large group of blacks in one place, there will be mayhem, shootings, vandalism and rioting. The BayFest here in my city I avoid because of the huge hordes of blacks which are armed and under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The bands there are a wide range of genres, unfortunately rap and hip hop are among them. Anywhere that garbage is played garbage people show up. The police there will not allow whites to carry concealed weapons there even with a permit, not that I would want to use a gun to defend myself with innocent people everywhere at risk of being hit by stray bullets. Blacks when they shoot up the place do not care who may be wounded or killed by their mis-aimed gunfire. Therefore the only way these &#8220;Black Expos&#8221; should ever be permitted to take place would be hordes of machine gun toting police and soldiers in and around the area to arrest, subdue or shoot any unruly or violent blacks. The simple fact is, were I a city official who had to deal with these events, I would not allow any Black Expos or any large events that cater to blacks, except those that pertain to religion perhaps. If they want to have a large peaceful gathering under the auspices of a church or legitimate social club or organization well and good. If they want a rowdy and massive block party, I would tell them to go elsewhere because they are not permitted.</p>

		<p>This despite the fact that, at every NRA convention, there are hundreds of weapons, knives and ammo boxes on display. Last year, the NRA convention drew over 60,000 people, and this year&rsquo;s convention drew over 70,000 people. No reports whatsoever, of any mayhem.</p>
<p>And why do our privileged elites want to ultimately end all gun shows, and close &#8220;the gun show loophole&#8221;? Because most people at guns shows are white and conservative  &mdash;  the people most distrusted by our liberal oligarchy. <br>

<p>The NRA convention was in Downtown St. Louis in 2007.  The same gun-hating city politicians openly welcomed all that money flowing into downtown businesses.  Maybe they didn&rsquo;t realize that so many people can buy and sell so many guns close to so many blacks without an explosion in the crime rate   &mdash;   It&rsquo;s just that the buyers and sellers have something taboo in common.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the very same section of Downtown STL where the NRA convention was held, the city is trying to pull the liquor licenses of three nightclubs because they have special 18-and-older hip hop nights.  Guns + Whites = No problem, Alcohol + Hip Hop Music + Young black men = Big problems. </p>

<p>The attitudes of St. Louis politicians loving NRA money, at the latter&rsquo;s convention there, in 2007; reminds me of theses lines Richard Gere told Julia Roberts in &#8220;Pretty Woman&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I lived in Indianapolis for 20 years.  The east side of town was mostly houses/apartments  for the working class. Not the best, but livable.  Then, in their infinite wisdom, they subsidized most of the housing on the east side. It&rsquo;s about 75% black, and now has the highest crime rate in the county. <br>
Yet, to point this out, is racist.</p>
