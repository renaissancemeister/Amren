<h1>Judge Questions if Calgary Mom Needs Jail Term for Killing Daughter</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daryl Slade, Calgary Herald, June 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A judge told court Tuesday he&rsquo;s struggling with the notion of sending a mother to prison for strangling her teenage daughter.</p>
<p>When told by Crown prosecutor Mac Vomberg that Aset Magomadova should receive a 12-year sentence, Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench Justice Sal LoVecchio countered: &#8220;You&rsquo;re suggesting every time a deterrent is needed, jail is necessary?&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier, LoVecchio asked Vomberg to justify a lengthy prison sentence for the mother, who fled war-torn Chechnya after her husband was killed by the Russians on his way to work in 1994 and she had most of her foot shot off in 1998.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me what protection the public needs?&#8221; the judge asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you saying she&rsquo;s a risk to go out and kill somebody else?&#8221;</p>
<p>Vomberg argued this is a case of domestic violence, which requires a strong jail sentence.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re not just dealing with fatal consequences, we&rsquo;re dealing with direct consequential damage,&#8221; said Vomberg, referring to the accused&rsquo;s wheelchair-bound son and his cousin.</p>
<p>Magomadova, a Muslim, admitted at trial to having a deadly confrontation with her troubled 14-year-old daughter Aminat at their home on Feb. 26, 2007.</p>
<p>At least some of it was over her daughter&rsquo;s reluctance to abide by her cultural values and to attend court that day for assaulting a teacher the previous October.</p>
<p>The mother faced a second-degree murder charge in connection with the fatal confrontation, but was convicted last October by LoVecchio of manslaughter.</p>
<p>Manslaughter carries with it anywhere from a suspended sentence to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Vomberg pointed out that he and defence lawyer Alain Hepner, who will argue today for his client not to be incarcerated, are at &#8220;polar opposites&#8221; in their sentencing submissions.</p>
<p>Vomberg argued that Aset Magomadova, 39, who came to Canada as a refugee in 2003, abused her trust and authority when she killed Aminat.</p>
<p><br>
All the legal wrangling pales in comparison to what this family has endured, and the continued suffering of its surviving members</p>
<p>He also stressed the victim was seeking help, trying to get out of the house, before she was killed, and that the mother continues to portray herself as the victim.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not how parents resolve their disputes with their teenage children,&#8221; the prosecutor told LoVecchio.</p>
<p>Forensic psychologist Patrick Baillie testified that the mother is a very low risk to reoffend in any violent manner and could benefit from appropriate counselling. He said Magomadova, who has only a Grade 3 education, has significant deficit in verbal reasoning and comprehension. However, he said, she has taken responsibility for her death and expressed remorse.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a constant pain to her, she described it as like losing a part of her body &hellip; she is not pointing a finger at anyone, she is responsible,&#8221; Baillie said.</p>
<p>Vomberg said although the woman comes from a background with an extraordinary level of violence and turmoil, there still is no justification for her actions that day.</p>
<p>Despite her many adjustments to a new country, Vomberg added, Magomadova had an obligation to assist her daughter and younger son cope with their new life.</p>
<p>Hepner previously said he would argue for a conditional jail sentence to be served in the community. But, on Tuesday, he only said he would ask for no jail and agreed that he and the Crown were at opposite ends of the spectrum. He will make his sentencing argument today.</p>
<p>LoVecchio said in his verdict that Magomadova wasn&rsquo;t defending herself when she strangled Aminat, but added she didn&rsquo;t intend to kill the girl.</p>
<p>He said he convicted her of manslaughter, because she went too far in trying to end an altercation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I find that Ms. Magomadova, by choosing to apply a ligature  &mdash;  in this case, a scarf  &mdash;  for at least 2 1/2 minutes, was the application of excessive force,&#8221; LoVecchio ruled.<br>

		<p>If it was a WHITE CHRISTIAN mother, would there be any argument as to the sentence?  No, of course not.  But liberal judges and liberal politicians constantly excuse horrendous crimes by outsiders - primarily blacks, muslims and hispanics.  Why?  Because to do otherwise would be to admit those three groups account for nearly ALL crimes committed.  And then they would have to defend themselves as to WHY they keep IMPORTING these habitually criminal elements in massive numbers.</p>

<p>Okay that right there, the fact the daughter had to go to court for assaulting a teacher changes the context of this story. And when they say &#8220;abide by cultural values&#8221; that might mean not be violent and verbally abusive to family members in the house!</p>
<p>The article also says the mother didn&rsquo;t mean to kill her but went too far to &#8220;end an altercation&#8221;. Sounds like the daughter was violent and things just got out of hand. This does not sound like a honor killing at all.</p>

		<p>Hmmm, wouldn&rsquo;t manslaughter be smacking the kid and causing her to fall and hit her head and accidently dying?  Wrapping a scarf around the girls neck and choking her to death is murder.  This judge can not see the difference?  And doesn&rsquo;t want her to go to jail?  He wants a woman with that uncontrollable a temper loose in the community?  Yikes.  Maybe she could live with his family.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to work up much sympathy for any parties in this case. It seems the whole family is just one nightmarish package of trouble. What a wonderful gift to Canada&rsquo;s diversity!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see now:<br>
The daughter was due in ocurt for assaulting a teacher (before she got strangled by her mother).<br>
The son is in a wheelchair (no mention of why).<br>
The mother  &#8220;has a significant deficit in verbal reasoning and comprehension.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, yes. What a fine contribution to Canadian society.   <br>
And I&rsquo;ll bet they&rsquo;re all living on Canada&rsquo;s generous welfare!</p>

<p>For all their handicaps, they managed to transport themselves halfway around the planet to place the burden of their existance on Canadians.  Some refugees.</p>
<p>Canada should quit the convention on international refugees, and only take asylum seekers who will fit in, i.e. Western Europeans.</p>
<p>Anyone else showing up to claim refugee status should be sent to a U.N. camp, or a third country of their choice.</p>

		<p>Having raised two daughters, I can understand the occasional desire to strangle one of them. But like most civilized persons, I didn&rsquo;t ACT upon that fleeting desire. Anyone who kills their child needs to go to prison because they know this is wrong, no matter where they come from or what they have suffered through in their past. Killing a teenager by strangulation is a bit more than &#8220;excessive force&#8221; in any culture or civilization in the 21st century  &mdash;  or should be. There is no reason this woman should get a free pass on murder just because she has escaped from a war-torn third-world hellhole and is one of millions just like her who are trying to turn our country into the same mess she came from. </p>

		<p>Of all the persons mentioned by Solzhenitsyn as inhabiting the GULAG, the Chechens were the ONLY group retaining their honor and not groveling.</p>
<p>But are &#8220;honor bound&#8221; persons from a society where maintaining your honor means KILLING!!</p>
<p>Disputes are settled by KILLING! NO matter what, NO matter whom.</p>
<p>Sort of like the Siclians with their vendetta. Blood feuds settled with blood!!</p>

<p>  I have to agree this murder doesn&rsquo;t fit the &#8220;honor killing&#8221; pattern. Chechens have been brutalized by decades of warfare first with Stalin then with the post-Soviet Russia government. I don&rsquo;t see that Islam had anything to do with this tragedy. It is more in the tradition of the blood feuds common in the Caucus.  </p>

<p>Chechens are, of course, Muslims.</p>
<p>The daughter&rsquo;s reluctance in the eyes of the mother, to abide by her cultural values would suggest her murder was prompted at least in part, by the tradition of &#8216;family honour&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Incidently, Sikhs and to a somewhat lesser extent, Hindus also kill in its name.</p>

<p><br>
Nowhere does it say this was an &#8220;honor killing&#8221;.  Nobody made that claim at all.  But twisting a scarf around her neck and holding it for several minutes certainly doesn&rsquo;t sound like any accident either!</p>
