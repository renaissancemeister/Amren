<h1>Chief: Arrest a Miscommunication</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Johnson, Athens Banner-Herald (Georgia), July 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cornerback Jordan Lawrence Love, 19 [a University of Georgia football player], was charged with misdemeanor obstruction, but he did not willingly try to deceive the officer, who was investigating a complaint that men were shooting off fireworks in the courtyard of McWhorter Hall, Williamson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Love gave his first and last name, but he said he didn&rsquo;t know his middle name, then said he kind of knew it, but didn&rsquo;t know how to spell it,&#8221; Williamson [UGA police Chief Jimmy Williamson] said.</p>
<p>&#8220;After I spoke with family members today I could see the officer&rsquo;s point of view, where he thought Mr. Love was evasive and uncooperative, but (Love&rsquo;s) mother explained that he does not go by his middle name for personal reasons,&#8221; Williamson said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The officer who arrested Love probably decided to lock up the third-string redshirt freshman based on previous experience with deceptive and uncooperative offenders, according to Williamson.</p>
<p>&#8220;After multiple unsuccessful attempts to obtain Love&rsquo;s date of birth and the spelling of his middle name, Love was placed under arrest at (10:07 p.m.) for misdemeanor obstruction,&#8221; the officer wrote in the arrest report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Williamson plans to use Love&rsquo;s arrest as a &#8220;learning opportunity&#8221; when training officers how to interact with the public, he said.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not a &#8216;misunderstanding&rsquo; when police arrest or detain whites by &#8216;racial profiling&rsquo;. Either because police watch the same news we do (not to mention the same diversity training), and they feel, since people of color are unfairly being stopped, it&rsquo;s OK to question more whites to make things fair (not to mention they&rsquo;re a lot less scared of investigating whites). It&rsquo;s not a &#8216;misunderstanding&rsquo; at all for whites who live or work or visit the vibrant, cherished, neighborhoods of color in our republic. It&rsquo;s quite OK to assume they are there to buy drugs, prostitutes, stolen goods, etc and there&rsquo;s no problem with that at all. </p>

		<p>The &#8220;learning opportunity&#8221; will be that when black thugs and hispanic illegal aliens give false names and phony i.d.&rsquo;s the cops should let it slide in order to avoid a &#8220;civil rights&#8221; lawsuit. </p>

<p>Learning Opportunities 101:</p>
<p>When White policeman confronts a black for questioning, he must always remain culturally sensitive and understand that what his police manual may describe as a crime is only &#8220;acting out&#8221; in the black community and does not rise to the level of an actual crime.  If police officer becomes confused about how to proceed, he should immediately leave the scene and return to the command post where he can undergo psychological testing for &#8220;lingering and unrecognized racism and bias&#8221; and volunteer for more sensitivity training, including practicing how to &#8220;hold himself accountable to people of color for his unearned White privileges&#8221;.<br/>

		<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t have happened if White alumni weren&rsquo;t addicted to college sports, or if Americans recognized that sports have nothing to do with education.</p>

		<p>It seems to be perfectly reasonable for a policeman to expect a college student (of any color or culture) to know his birthdate and middle name. <br/>
This is something most 4 year old have already figured out. <br/>
If said college student claims he &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t know&#8221; his middle name or &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t know how to spell it&#8221; (more believable given some of the names &hellip;) and doesn&rsquo;t know his birthdate, the officer has every right to hold that person for investigation into what his problem might be. (Drugs, alcohol, mental illness or disorientation from some recent accident or blow to the head, diabetic shock&hellip; any number of things that need checking into for the safety of everyone concerned.)</p>

		<p>With our high schools focusing on &#8220;self-esteem&#8221; instead of genuine education, and graduating imbeciles who can not read or write, it is entirely possible that Mr. Love could not spell his own middle name.</p>

		<p>&#8220;With our high schools focusing on &ldquo;self-esteem&rdquo; instead of genuine education, and graduating imbeciles who can not read or write, it is entirely possible that Mr. Love could not spell his own middle name&#8221;.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s true our nations schools seem overly concerned about esteeming girls and students of color, this concern does not always extend to white boys - white men often being seen as the cause of everyone else&rsquo;s negative issues - that must be aired to the exclusion of all else. Any other conclusion (that white men are cause of all evil in history, and evils continuation in the present) might endanger their self-esteem, not to mention would be very &#8216;insensitive&rsquo;.</p>
