			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laura Payton, Toronto Sun, July 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Canada should ban burkas in public, according to more than half of the people polled exclusively for QMI Agency.</p>
<p>The Leger Marketing online poll found 54% of people surveyed said the government should follow France&rsquo;s lead and not allow women to wear burkas in public for safety and transparency reasons.</p>
<p>Only 20% of respondents said Canada shouldn&rsquo;t consider a ban because it&rsquo;s an issue of freedom of religion and freedom of expression, and 15% said it didn&rsquo;t affect them either way.</p>
<p>Older Canadians were more likely to agree with a ban, with 71% of those 65 years and older choosing that option. Only 40% of Canadians 18-34 years old said burkas should be banned.</p>
<p>Leger Marketing vice-president Dave Scholz said the poll surprised staff at the research firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Canada  &mdash;  we don&rsquo;t ban anything,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Sentiment was particularly strong in Quebec, where the debate over reasonable accommodation for new Canadians has been raging, with 73% of respondents saying they want a ban.</p>
<p>Morton Weinfeld, a sociology professor at McGill University, said the strong response in Quebec could be a result of spending 50 years cutting down the place of Catholicism in the province.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should they fill that void with Islam?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quebec is perhaps the most strongly feminist place in Canada and the burka is a strongly anti-woman phenomenon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weinfeld said people should be careful when interpreting the survey results because the burka is the most extreme Islamic covering. He said nobody knows how many Canadians wear the burka.</p>
<p>The survey question didn&rsquo;t explain the difference between the burka, which covers the entire face, the niqab, which has a slit for the eyes, and the hijab, a headscarf.</p>
<p>The poll shows there&rsquo;s a need for more outreach and education, said the executive director of the Canadian Council on American-Islamic Relations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s understandable that practices that might be unfamiliar to people cause tension and unease,&#8221; said Ihsaan Gardee, adding it&rsquo;s a minority within a minority who cover their faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s choice to practise a sincerely held religious belief .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it must be protected under the charter, provided it does not infringe on the rights of others,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Muslim Canadian Congress founder Tarek Fatah, however, has been pushing for a ban on burkas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Progressive and liberal Muslims have been leading the fight against this abomination for the last 100 years,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is one of the ugliest aspects of political Islam that has been imported into Canada and other western countries,&#8221; Fatah added.</p>
<p>The web survey asked 1,526 people to choose the statement that best reflects their view of France&rsquo;s move to ban women from wearing a burka in public. The survey was conducted July 19-22. Leger doesn&rsquo;t measure margin of error in online surveys because it&rsquo;s not a random sample.</p>
<p><b>Burka: </b>Most concealing of all Islamic veils. Covers entire body with mesh over the face.</p>
<p><b>Hijab: </b>Arabic for veil. Square scarf covering head and neck is the most common style worn by Muslim women in the West.</p>
<p><b>Niqab: </b>Veil for face that leaves only the eyes uncovered. Common across much of the Arabian peninsula and Pakistan.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: Which statement best reflects your view on France&rsquo;s government trying to ban burkas in public?</b></p>
<p>54% Canada should follow France. Nobody should be able to cover their faces. It is a matter of public safety and business transparency.</p>
<p>20% Canada shouldn&rsquo;t even consider banning burkas. It&rsquo;s an issue of freedom of religion and expression</p>
<p>15% It doesn&rsquo;t affect me either way</p>
<p>11% Not sure</p>
<p>1% No answer</p>
<p><b>Percentage of population who think burkas should be banned</b></p>
<p>39% B.C.</p>
<p>45% Alberta</p>
<p>43% Saskatchewan, Manitoba</p>
<p>53% Ontario</p>
<p>73% Quebec</p>
<p>54% Atlantic</p>
<p>Due to rounding, not all figures add up to 100%<br>

<p>Too bad.  Like the US, France and the rest of Europe, Canada volunteered to take these people now take them for what they are and quit whining about what they wear.</p>
<p>The elites have endangered all our lives by encouraging these people to come in.  They deserve all the trouble that such acceptance is going to cause them in addition to jihad.</p>

<p>Not only should Canada ban burkas but Canada should ban those who wear them, as well!</p>

		<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t just banning immigration from islamic countries be a better solution? This would stop the burka, &#8220;honor&#8221; killings, terrorism, etc. I don&rsquo;t see where muslim immigration is a positive for any western country in the world at all.</p>

		<p>The banning of specifically the burka or niqab or any covering that hides the wearewr&rsquo;s identity being constantly broadcast as being a Muslm religious must is rubbish.  Nowhere in the Koran or the Hadiths are such actions called for as reported on by Muslim experts who have renounced Islam.  Originally it is thought that the covering was to protect the women from sun aging efects and from blowing sand in Arabia, but certainly never for religious reasons so the answer is to enforce/reinforce any laws that allow any human being to disguise themselves IN PUBLIC anywhere for security reasons.</p>
<p>Enough said!  Do not be sidelined by the spurious shouting from the Muslims that their rights are being attacked.  It is all part of the plan to make Islam acceptable to the West&rsquo;s young people so a Muslim takeover in the future can be made more possible.  So called moderate Muslims will follow the flow so do not rely on them to sort out the mess.</p>
<p>Let us not be fooled.  A return to a high moral standard is needed in the West as the Muslims will use the open porn and common bad language use by the young and those of low intelligence to seduce the young into Islam.  </p>
<p>After all Christianity did just that a few hundred years ago.</p>

		<p>What is completely missed here is that in Islam, the terrorists who are males will pose as females with a burka and hide their identity in disguise to commit their atrocities. </p>
<p>Even though some women commit terror acts we know 99% are men and some who use burkas. Suicide bombers are all small arabs anyway not large ones. </p>

		<p>Sorry but this is pathetic. Except QUE, almost 60% of ENG CAN thinks Islamic garb is acceptable and ONLY because of the aging &amp; mostly White population! 2/3 of young people think Islamic garb is ok, so these White liberals will be easy prey for Islamic conversion after The System can&rsquo;t pay for their hedonistic lifestyle. You need a national ethnic-based Orthodox Church to be an alternative. CAN is a lost cause but Anglo-Americans with pre-Civil War roots can still establish an ethnic Church. </p>
