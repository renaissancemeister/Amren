<h1>Obama Blames Politics for Delay on Immigration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Darlene Superville, Yahoo News, July 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama on Thursday blamed immigration policy gridlock on &#8220;political posturing and special interest wrangling.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said the problem cannot be solved &#8220;only with fences and border patrols&#8221; but said the government should be held accountable for its responsibility to secure the border. Obama also said that businesses should face consequences for knowingly employing illegal immigrants. And he said those who enter the country illegally should own up to their actions before they can begin the process of becoming citizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question now is whether we will have the courage and the political will to pass a bill through Congress, to finally get it done,&#8221; the president said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m ready to move forward, the majority of Democrats are ready to move forward and I believe the majority of Americans are ready to move forward. But the fact is that without bipartisan support, as we had just a few years ago, we cannot solve this problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reform that brings accountability to our immigration system cannot pass without Republican votes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is the political and mathematical reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>White House officials say recent developments influenced Obama&rsquo;s decision to give his first formal speech on the issue as president, most notably Arizona&rsquo;s enactment of a tough anti-immigrant law and the reaction to it across the country. But advocates also have been pressing him to give such a speech as a demonstration of his commitment to seeing the effort through.</p>
<p>Obama didn&rsquo;t dwell on the Arizona law in the speech. He called it an understandable byproduct of public frustration with the government&rsquo;s inability to tighten the system, but also said the law is ill-conceived, divisive and would put undue pressure on local authorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the speech, Obama extolled America&rsquo;s history as a melting pot of immigrants and lauded their many contributions to the nation.</p>
<p>But an Associated Press-GfK Poll conducted in May found 57 percent saying illegal immigrants are mostly a drain on society and 38 percent said they believe immigrants make a contribution. Eight in 10 said the federal government should do more to keep immigrants from illegally entering the U.S.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some Republicans, like Kyl, are pushing a &#8220;border security first&#8221; approach focused on enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&rsquo;t work,&#8221; Obama said. He said there now are more &#8220;boots on the ground&#8221; on the U.S.-Mexico border than ever before and that &#8220;our borders are just too vast for us to be able to solve the problem only with fences and border patrols.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Rush Limbaugh said that he noticed that, while most people ignore Obama speeches this day, as most people realize that what he says is mindless baby pablum, people were paying attention to Obama&rsquo;s mindless baby pablum on immigration.  I hope people are really that tuned in to the immigration issue, because it&rsquo;s so important.  I would hate to think that most people are only interested in it as a matter of more people competing for fewer jobs in this rotten economy.  Still, if that&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;re concerned about, it&rsquo;s a valid concern, and Obama will still hurt himself by pushing for any kind of amnesty, whether it&rsquo;s wholesale, executive order, salami slicing or simple refusal to enforce.</p>
<p>Two points Obama made that I want to respond to:</p>
<p>1.  CBP stating that the # of attempted or successful illegal crossings are down.  First, we don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true, because the President controls the Border Patrol.  They might be jimmying stats just to please the President.  (Or Obama just might be making it up out of thin air.)  Second, even if it is true, it&rsquo;s probably because of laws like SB 1070.  Third, even if it is true, it&rsquo;s not going to be true for much longer  &mdash;  The more the Obamas of the world keep promising amnesty, the more they&rsquo;re going to sneak in or try, in order to get in while the gettin&rsquo;s about to be good.</p>
<p>2.  He whined that SB 1070 is too costly for AZ&rsquo;s local and state LEOs to enforce in tight budget times.  First off, why do you think AZ is having budget problems?  Partially because of so many welfare-dependent illegal (and some legal) aliens from Mexico and Indoamerica.  SB 1070 was actually designed to help AZ&rsquo;s budget, not hurt it.  The other point is that SB 1070 is almost expense-free to enforce, relatively speaking.  Sure, they&rsquo;ll have to spend a day or so in the county can waiting around for ICE to tell the AZ cops to let them loose (which is what will happen most of the time), but it&rsquo;s not as if many of them don&rsquo;t spend a little time in the county can for other things anyway.</p>

		<p>For border security Obama can&rsquo;t spend a million dollars for a fence. But for his worthless and wasteful &#8220;stimulus&#8221;  package he can throw away a BILLION times that amount without blinking an eye. </p>

		<p>There is no need for any talk of Mexican amnisty.  America has already gone through this during the debates on the -Mazzoli Act.  The politicians promised back then that they would enforce the immigration laws from then on.  <br>

		<p>Obama is down in the polls right now which makes it easy for Republicans to claim they oppose illegal immigration and amnesty. But when it comes to G.O.P. senators like Kyl and Cornym, &#8220;their hearts are bad,&#8221; as frontiersmen used to say about smiling Indians who were merely waiting for a good opportunity to attack.  Most famous name Republicans are in thrall to the big business - cheap labor lobbies and can&rsquo;t be trusted. They are as bad as McCain, just not as loud.  And Representative Eric Cantor, the House Minority Whip - the rising star of Republican congressman - is a certified, neocon, open-borders traitor.  He will stab us in the back first chance he gets.   </p>

		<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;estimated 11 million illegal immigrants&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s only 11 million? Did 1 million go home or did they vanish into the American heartland?</p>
<p>President Obama blames the Senate. You know who I don&rsquo;t hear anyone talking about? The American people and what they think about amnesty and a &#8216;pathway to citizenship&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The REASON Senators are reticent to tackle &#8216;comprehensive immigration reform&rsquo; (read: AMNESTY) is because the American PEOPLE DON&rsquo;T WANT AMNESTY.</p>
<p>If Senators had an inkling of support from constituents, this might have a chance at passing.</p>
<p>The reason it has no Senate support is because it has no support among American citizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please Mr. President, Senators. Explain to the American people why amnesty would be good for the American people; especially in the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one explaination they can&rsquo;t give us. Hence, the American people are not even considered in this debate.</p>

		<p>Mr. Obama have shown shallowness of his mind. Now, he moves to stage two of the game: betrayal</p>
<p>Illegal immigration <i>is</i> a political issue, just like election fraud or neo-socialism that he is pushing down our throats are. The rebellious and highly fertile &#8220;immigrants&#8221; from Mexico are quickly becoming the largest political threat to the U.S. since WWII. Interestingly, he and his party, whose many members will prostitute themselves to Mexican invaders just to get re-elected, deem everything &#8220;political&#8221; except for issues on which they don&rsquo;t want the majority to prevail. They will engineer elections of morons to the U.S. government for such political reasons as &#8220;social justice&#8221; or &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221;, and support bills that strenghten their base (like amnesty of monopoly on collective bargaining) no matter how detrimental they may be to our country. Those who studied history of Soviet Union may find obvious similarities with Obama&rsquo;s rhetoric. Just look how political the Supreme Court nominations hearing are in the eyes of Democratic senators. </p>
<p>Two major fallacies that Mr. Obama is peddling are: </p>
<p>1. He claims, together with the open border and pro-invasion lobby, that the measures like border and immigration enforcement cannot accomplish much (this ostensibly is why they are opposed to such measures), although the fact is that the more practical an enforcement proposal is (like building a manned double fence on the border or deport all illegal aliens that get in contact with the law enforcement agents) the more Mr. Obama and his Mexican collaborators oppose it. They want the Feds to have monopoly on enforcement of anything that can lead to deportations of illegals because they know well how indolent the Feds have been with immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>2. He claims that the &#8220;system is broken&#8221; while the only broken part of the system is the enforcement (in particular, border control and deportations) that are broken, mostly because the executive branch&rsquo;s unwillingness perform their constitutional duty. It&rsquo;s like is your local sheriff would declare the penal code &#8220;broken&#8221; because he refuses to go after the thieves, robbers, and rapists.  </p>
<p>I believe Mr. Obama perceives the U.S. as a white country and does what he can to change it. Because he does not really identify himself with the majority, he apparently has no problem with betraying it. For him, these are whites and not the Mexican invaders, or any other non-white adversaries of the U.S., that are the bad guys here. Hence, he has sided with Mexico agains AZ in the recent dispute regarding the &#8220;controversial&#8221; AZ 1070 law, in spite the fact that this is Mr. Obama, and not the AZ law, that is controversial.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a large part of Washington&rsquo;s establishment shares Mr. Obama&rsquo;s hostility towards white majority. They will stop their crusade only if one of the two things happen: either they lose their power (watch for November 2 and the election fraud that is likely to be rampart) or whites are reduced to the role of tax slaves working for the wellbeing of the &#8220;minorities&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Were the economy not in the toilet, Obama would likely be able to ram amnesty through Congress against the wishes of the vast majority of Americans.  But alas the economy is sliding toward the abyss.  A population base with a rapidly expanding third-world demographic simply cannot sustain a first-world standard of living.</p>

		<p>The Democrats have the majority in both houses to pass through an amnesty so blaming Republicans is nonsense. They don&rsquo;t care what middle America thinks about their amnesty, they certainly didn&rsquo;t care with the health care bill. They&rsquo;ll be a huge push to legalize these aliens after amnesty to register new voters for the Democrat Party.  The real problem here is somebody has to give up some power to make room for the latinos. Will it be any number of black caucus members like the corrupt and illiterate Maxine Waters who&rsquo;ll be tossed out into the cold by her thankful hispanic constituents and replaced with one of their own?  </p>

<p>So true, Charles Marlow, so true.</p>
<p>One or two things that stood out to me when I watched Obama&rsquo;s speech today;  When he mentioned immigrants of the past who had contributed to American progress, all were European whites.  He repeated the cliche&rsquo; of immigrants building America, and invoked the 19th century Statue of Liberty vision without (as usual)accounting for a government that was then trying to fill up vacant land with - people!, and does not make proportions an issue in light of that fact.  He said that America attracts the best minds.  Maybe in the past, but not anymore, and aside from that statistical fault, America is attracting far more and in the hundreds of thousands of multiples of sub standard IQ/mentality groups en masse, than we ever have attracted of brilliant individuals.  But most importantly, he called U.S. laws &#8220;unenforcable,&#8221; - The President of the United States called U.S. (immigration) law unenforcable.  Let me be clear, he said that in referrence to the control of the borders and illegals inside the U.S.  Did he not take an oath to enforce U.S. law, not ignore it, let alone betray U.S. law?</p>
<p>Our president is an anti-establishment protestor (a President SUING a State???), and nothing showed it better than this last comment.  All this cannot last very much longer.</p>

		<p>Obama is a total prevaricator: When Bush and McCain proposed amnesty several years ago, the American people were outraged and their protests caused the politicians to abandon the legislation. The politicians wanted amnesty then and many probably still do, but they are also aware that if they cast their votes in favor of amnesty in all likelihood they are going to be voted out of office at the next election unless they represent safely liberal districts. </p>
<p>Amnesty has not been approved because the American voters have protested against it.  </p>

		<p>Hearing that controlling the border won&rsquo;t work reminds me of the death penalty. The ideologues who claim it won&rsquo;t work are the same ones who make sure it doesn&rsquo;t. What a circular argument by traitors posing as our leaders! How do we know what will work, if we&rsquo;ve never seriously tried? Less advanced countries control their borders and illegal immigration: </p>
<p>* India is finishing a 2,500 mile fence along its border with Bangladesh: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/23uhr8l" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/23uhr8l</a> </p>
<p>* Morocco built a 1,600 mile sand berm to keep out Polisario guerillas: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/294bgr7" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/294bgr7</a></p>
<p>* In Operation Wetback, the Eisenhower Administration removed a million illegals with 1954 technology and a fraction of today&rsquo;s manpower: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/prtjq" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/prtjq</a></p>
<p>If we ever do try to end this invasion, and apply a fraction of the resources we regularly blow on Iraq, Afghanistan or any number of other boondoggles, I predict we&rsquo;ll be surprised how simple this problem was all along, if we&rsquo;d just had the will.<br>

		<p>So Obama claims that the AZ law would &#8220;put undue pressure on local authorities&#8221;.  Has anyone heard a chorus of protest from cops on the beat or from prosecutors  &mdash;  people who are always looking for one or two more charges to add to keep criminals off the street a while longer?  <br>
The problem with Obama&rsquo;s proposal is, of course, that it&rsquo;s meaningless.  It&rsquo;s just a stall until after the elections, and then he&rsquo;ll REALLY have the Republicans to blame.  They, in turn, will likely blame him for not supporting some anti-illegal measure, and the two factions will continue to dance around the issue.  Luckily, many of the south-of-the-border illegals are ignorant, superstitious peasants who are easily spooked and are threatened by the mere possibility of a crackdown.  They&rsquo;ll scurry like rats from one area to the next as one state after the other is forced to adopt laws like Arizona&rsquo;s.  Even New England will rebel if overrun with them.</p>

		<p>For a country that even Obama admits occasionally can &#8220;do anything,&#8221; he&rsquo;s fond of saying we can&rsquo;t deport   &mdash;  - (you fill in the number)illegal aliens. Which is closest? The moon or the border? I think we can if there is the will, Mr. President. You failed to mention that we can do three thing that will guarantee self-deportation: 1. Mandate, and enforce, E-verify for all businesses. 2. Immediately stop all benefits 3. straighten out the misinterpreted 14th amendment. Next problem?</p>

		<p>Put the untruth to the liar people.</p>
<p>Get in a general, a psychologist and a historian.</p>
<p>And have them explain the mass psychologies of people living off the grid and how a little loss in support networking can be turned into a big fallout on the illegals state of mind as a whole.  Especially if you go after big business and get rid of the do-nothings in the Immigration services who try to block things locally as they did in 1954 during Operation Wetback when Eisenhower brought in an Army general, gave him blanket authority and-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The effort began in California and Arizona, and coordinated 1075 Border Patrol agents, along with state and local police agencies, to mount an aggressive crackdown. Tactics employed included going as far as systematic police sweeps of Mexican-American neighborhoods, and random stops and ID checks of &#8220;Mexican-looking&#8221; people in a region with many Native Americans and native Hispanics. In some cases, illegal immigrants were deported along with their American-born minor dependent children. This occurred despite the fact the children were, according to the Supreme Court&rsquo;s interpretation of the 14th amendment, citizens of the United States. Some 750 agents targeted agricultural areas with a goal of 1000 apprehensions per day. By the end of July, over 50,000 immigrants were caught in the two states. An estimated 488,000 illegal immigrants are claimed to have left voluntarily, for fear of being apprehended. By September, 80,000 had been taken into custody in Texas, and the INS estimates that 500,000 to 700,000 had left Texas of their own accord. To discourage illicit re-entry, buses and trains took many deportees deep within Mexican territory, prior to releasing them. Tens of thousands more were deported by two chartered ships, the Emancipation and the Mercurio. The ships ferried them from Port Isabel, Texas, to Veracruz, Mexico, more than 500 miles (800 kilometers) to the south. Some were taken as far as 1,000 miles. Deportation by sea was ended after seven deportees jumped overboard from the Mercurio and drowned, provoking a mutiny which led to a public outcry in Mexico.[3]<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Show the ignorant public the logistics of moving large numbers of people with the kinds of transport systems we have (single cities move hundreds of thousands by bus and train and plane folks, EVERY DAY).</p>
<p>EXPLAIN what happens when a husband is deported and a woman cannot feed her family without turning herself in as well because the welfare dole is over and companies dare not hire illegals or suffer massive fines and penalties.</p>
<p>Take a digital snapshot of the border areas.  Do an airplane zoom and fly along sweep to show how ONLY 250nm is really threatened with inundation because the rest is _well nigh impassable_ (_Alien Nation_).</p>
<p>Let the General show how modern technology (IR cameras on telescoping masts) let Border Patrol agents scan ENORMOUS areas using just a single man.  Show how this can expand with systems like REMBASS and similar _unattended_ ground sensors which can detect seismic movements over wide areas.  Show how long a Reaper or Warrior UAV can linger (24-32hrs).  How field fortifications can be built from stacked plastic boxes, filled with dirt like sandbags and THOUSANDS OF FEET LONG.  In a single day.  With one frontloader.</p>
<p>EMPOWER local Sheriff&rsquo;s and Highway Patrol officers to assist.  Allowing them to apprehend Illegals that have made it to roads and are not pursuable &#8216;for fear of accident&rsquo; by Federal authorities for instance.</p>
<p>FINE MEXICO (using unallocated foreign aid moneys if need be) and remove her MFN trade status for not controlling her borders.</p>
<p>Make sure the entire American Populace realizes that Mexico will not let in immigrants of any kind.  Nor will China, Japan, Korea, India, Nigeria, Egypt, Cuba, Haiti or any of the huge number of other nations that send us their criminals and indigent.</p>
<p>Pull the &#8216;it can&rsquo;t be done&rsquo; rug out from under the feet of these IDIOTS trying to sell us lie after lie.  It would not be hard to shut down the border traffic with 1/10th of what we are throwing away to NON AMERICANS in AfG and Iraq.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time we took back our lives, our lands and our governing.  And the surest way to get there is to make it clear that, far from being &#8216;too hard&rsquo;, this is actually one of the simplest environmental cleanups we could possible undertake to fix.</p>
<p>And it is ours to do.  Because these are OUR LANDS.  Not Mexico&rsquo;s.  Not &#8216;Aztlanians&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could have all the enforcement you need by legalising the militia groups to hunt illegal aliens. The bloodshed would be horrendous but they would get the job done.&#8221;</p>
<p>This will occur when the Federal Government collpases.  The first sign of this collapse is evident today in this week&rsquo;s statement that it is impossible, financially impossible to secure our borders.  Note that historically, when a nation falls into chaos and civil war, the municipal rule had been disintegrating for years.  Our cities and now our states are collapsing financially, which is even more telling than crime rates.  Misrule, and the corruption that comes with it is the cause.  Republicans have as much to do with it as the Dems until now when the Democratic regime is taking the misrule to new social and civil heights.  (Example; Regean&rsquo;s deregulation did not help ecomomic recovery but caused the Savings and Loan scandal, which was a harbringer, by giving permission due to a lack of consequences, for the financial sleaze fest that has led to this irreversable (IMO) downward slide.  Remember too that it was Regean who gave the first massive illegal immigrants amnesty in 1986).</p>
<p>I keep trying to guess how long it will be until the whole thing collapses into chaos and civil war.  Sometimes it looks emmient.  With the Arizona situation, it sure seems as if an active division of physical battle lines are forming. But such a behemoth as the U.S. will likely die a slow, agonizing death. I would argue that the death watch began in 1965.  Anyone care to guess how many more decades we have?  I would place it at the point where whites become less than 40% of the U.S. population and comprise  more than 60% of the elderly.<br>

BHO is correct that he can count on less Republican support this time than even just a couple of years ago. <br>
 <br>
And   &mdash;   knowing the mood of the country, as evidenced by overwhelming popularity of Gov. Jan Brewer&rsquo;s AZ initiative   &mdash;   any (R) who votes with the (D)s on this CRUCIAL, DEFINING ISSUE can kiss their seat goodbye, no matter how &#8220;safe&#8221; they think that seat is for them. In either 2010 or 2012 or both, it&rsquo;ll be a RINO holocaust for any &#8220;moderate&#8221; or &#8220;maverick&#8221; open-borders squishy-con who sides with the nation-wreckers by legalizing that which is illegal. <br>
 <br>
Starting with John McCain. <br>
 <br>
So the thing the GOP must do this year is to enforce Party discipline and tell ALL its members DO NOT cross Party lines on this one. Because if they do, the resulting flood of Undocumented Democrats will make future (R) presidents a demographic impossibility. The influx will literally END the Republican Party as a viable, electable force at the National level. And America will have had its last (R) administration&hellip; EVER. <br>

		<p>What we here is an affirmative action president.  His whole life was a pass due to being black.  He is admitting he is incapable of controlling/securing out borders against massive unarmed third world invaders with backpacks.  But yet he calls himself Commander-in-Chief of this country.  He sounds just like Maxine Waters.  Where is his advisor, Valerie Jarrett?  He dare not speak/act without getting her okay.  What a joke this country has allowed itself to be.  It has been downhill in leadership ever since the Founding Fathers.</p>

		<p>This is really a no-brainer.  Border states that are actually fed up with all the border crossings have the forces necessary at their collective disposal.  THey always have, they always will.  Brewer is being very dishonest as she can easily shut down her sector of the border.  How?  Every state governor can mobilize their respective Air and Army National Guard units under state controlled Title 32 Status.  IF they are federalized and fall under Title 10, then they cannot conduct any law enforcement activities as per Posse Comitatus.  THe option is to go Title 32 and mobilize the entire force structure of all border states and DC cannot say a thing about it.  THe cost will be on the state but there are many extra programs to cut on the illegals to pay for the program. All border states must do this immediately as it is the only way to stick it to the communist.  How do you think Puerto Rico gets by having ARNG/ANG provide law enforcement and counter drug in the urban areas?  By using Title 32.  It&rsquo;s not talked about alot but many states have used it.  Georgia used it for the Rodney King riots that destroyed the underground shopping area in Atlanta, etc.  </p>

<p>&#8220;I believe Mr. Obama perceives the U.S. as a white country and does what he can to change it. Because he does not really identify himself with the majority, he apparently has no problem with betraying it. For him, these are whites and not the Mexican invaders, or any other non-white adversaries of the U.S., that are the bad guys here. Hence, he has sided with Mexico agains AZ in the recent dispute regarding the &ldquo;controversial&rdquo; AZ 1070 law, in spite the fact that this is Mr. Obama, and not the AZ law, that is controversial.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Meh.  Wasn&rsquo;t it Rush Limbaugh who said Obama says nothing better than anyone else?  Wasn&rsquo;t it Obama who admitted that he said things that enabled people to hear whatever they wanted to?  With Obama in the White House and the Democrats controlling Congress, he has the numbers to pass amnesty, no matter how unpopular it is, whether the electorate wants it or not.  He demonstrated that with Comprehensive Healthcare Reform.  So, why won&rsquo;t they do the same with amnesty even without the Maverick Repugnants to supply them with cover?  Because, if they do so, in this economy, with people who are unable to get jobs and are watching their unemployment benefits run out, getting re-elected will be the least of their problems.  Holding onto their skins will be a bigger concern, because their fed-up constituents will simply string them up all over Washington.  </p>
<p>Paying lip service to Mexico filing against Arizona&rsquo;s SB1070 law is Obama&rsquo;s way of signaling to Latinos that he will grant their illegal relatives amnesty by presidential fiat after he is re-elected.  If they fall for his okie-dokie, they will still be out of luck, because Obama is a black nationalist who believes that White Wealth should be transferred to blacks via reparations, not shared with some newbie Mestizos.  We need to clean house by purging Congress of all RINO Republicans and every liberal Democrat we can. As Ron Paul noted, Americans enjoy the greatest amount of freedom when neither party controls both the White House and the Congress.  I think we could survive even a second Obama term IF the Congress is as far right wing conservative as we can muster.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Democrats have the majority in both houses to pass through an amnesty so blaming Republicans is nonsense. The real problem here is somebody has to give up some power to make room for the latinos. Will it be any number of black caucus members like the corrupt and illiterate Maxine Waters who&rsquo;ll be tossed out into the cold by her thankful hispanic constituents and replaced with one of their own?&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the REAL brake on the Amnesty Agenda.  The realization that Mestizos tend to run and elect their own Mestizo candidates once they achieve any significant numbers no matter how much indigenous White or black candidates pander to them.  Our White elite is belatedly realizing that these people didn&rsquo;t pay thousands of dollars to dangerous coyotes to cross deadly deserts to escape peonage to White Mexicans only to serve as an underpaid, powerless underclass for White Americans to rule over.  </p>
<p>So, now that they realize that Mestizos aren&rsquo;t the docile servant class that they had envisioned, what to do?    Continue pandering and just blow off the idea of their own sons and daughters continuing as the ruling elite OR seize on the economy as a welcome excuse to send them back home?   If they are smart, they will do the latter.  Assuming the economy ever heats up again, they should scuttle the 1965 Immigration Bill and focus on restoring the country&rsquo;s White European demographic if they want to hold onto power.  Otherwise, they will be toast long before the rest of us, sure as shooting.<br>

&#8220;&hellip; did you see how the so-called president GLOWED when he mention Hilda Solis&rsquo;s name and looked at her?&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
Solis gets goo-goo eyes from her boss for doing his bidding - shifting the focus, on behalf of illegal alien hires, away from from border security and labor law violations to exploitation of and compensation for their beloved free-range world workers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Hilda Solis Offers Federal Assistance to Illegal Aliens&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&rsquo;t as if the federal government isn&rsquo;t doing anything at all about the waves upon waves of illegal immigration that are sinking the Southwest into insolvency. The Feds do what they can to help  &mdash;  to help the invaders, that is. Here Obama&rsquo;s communist Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis spends your tax money on an ad encouraging illegal aliens to use federal resources to ensure they are getting paid enough at the jobs they take from Americans.&#8221;</p>
