<h1>Why Don&rsquo;t Black People Get Selected for Juries?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert de Neufville, Big Think, June 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Juries are disproportionately white. Although it is illegal to dismiss potential jurors on the basis of their race, lawyers can give any reason they want for dismissing a juror, and they are rarely challenged during the jury selection process. And in practice blacks are much more likely to be excluded from jury service than whites are.</p>
<p>A new study of the jury selection process in eight southern states (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee) by the Equal Justice Initiative found widespread racial discrimination, particularly in serious criminal cases. In one Alabama county 4 out of every 5 blacks who had qualified for jury service in capital cases were struck by prosecutors. And, according to the report, some district attorney&rsquo;s offices explicitly train prosecutors to exclude minorities from jury service under false pretenses, even though it is a violation of the law.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve had African-American jurors excluded because they&rsquo;re too old at 43, because they&rsquo;re too young at 28, while other white jurors much older are being accepted, and other white jurors much younger are being accepted,&#8221; The Equal Justice Initiative&rsquo;s Bryan Stevenson told NPR. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve had jurors excluded because they were in an interracial marriage or had a biracial son.&#8221; Stevenson said that another common reason for dismissing potential black jurors  &mdash;  including ones with college degrees  &mdash;  was that they were supposedly not smart enough.</p>

		<p>Several years ago I was told by a prosecutor from South Carolina that, at least in his area, they don&rsquo;t even bother going for the death penalty against black defendants because black jurors will not vote for it.  They can still get the death penalty against white defendants, of course, because blacks don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s a white executed, they only care about blacks.  It&rsquo;s not principled opposition to the death penalty in general, just pure racism.</p>

		<p>Federal Civil Rights laws disallow the prosecution from preemptively dismissing a potential black juror (i.e. not giving a reason for rejection) if the defendant is black.  This goes for state trials as well as Federal.  So all these clever reasons given in this article are wrong.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I think is that blacks will do anything and give any lame excuse to get out of jury duty.  Many jurisdictions really don&rsquo;t/can&rsquo;t enforce bench warrants against no-shows for jury duty.</p>

		<p>Blacks should be excluded, as most openly practice &#8220;jury nullification. That blacks disregard their responsibilities as citizens more than justifies automatically disqualifies them from all civic duties, including the right to vote.  </p>

		<p>The jurors, prospective, are chosen from the voter rolls. So many blacks do not register, forfeit their registration by moving, never vote, etc.</p>
<p>So many blacks have a criminal background, priors, members in prison, out on parole, etc.</p>
<p>And the ability to strike a prospective juror was ORIGINALLY a weapon used by defense lawyers to get rid of WHITEY they felt would be prejudicial.</p>
<p>The chickens have come home to roost now that the DA too can strike prospective jurors.</p>

		<p>I recently served jury duty and both the plaintiff and the defendant were Blacks and many of the initial selections for duty were also Blacks. I was surprised then, when every single Black person was dismissed except a mulatto doctor, leaving an almost all White jury. Not surprisingly, many of the liberal Whites followed the opinion of the doctor who sided against the plaintiff on the grounds that he was looked incompetent instead of the merits of the case, forcing us to go into a three hour deliberation, with only myself and a White engineer arguing on the basis of the law. Eventually our side won out, though I can imagine the situation if all the initial Blacks had stayed on the jury.</p>

		<p> Any group calling itself the Equal Justice Initiative doesn&rsquo;t seek &#8220;equal justice&#8221;   &mdash;   it seeks grievances, and revenge. I would wager if the rate of dismissal of black jurors was compared with the number of cases in which the defendant is black, we would see a very close correlation between the two.</p>
<p> And why is that so? Can you say, &#8220;Mostly black jury acquits O.J. Simpson&#8221;? Many, many blacks will not vote to convict a black defendant under any circumstances   &mdash;   especially if his victim or victims were White. Thus, prosecutors (and some of them may well be black, too   &mdash;   the article carefully avoids mentioning that) target blacks for dismissal since they want to obtain convictions. If red-headed White people were known to nearly always vote for acquittal, they would be the target of prosecutors during venire, also.</p>
<p> And here&rsquo;s another thing: If prosecutors are removing blacks from juries because they are more likely to vote to acquit other blacks, couldn&rsquo;t defense attorneys do the same thing with White jury pool members who might be more likely to vote to convict? It seems to me like it&rsquo;s as broad as it is long. But the news media never explores that possibility, does it? </p>

<p>St. Louis City needs so many prospective jurors that the state had to change the law recently to allow for a person to be called in for JD once every two years (it was once every three).  St. Louis City is the state&rsquo;s only jurisdiction that needs to call people in that often, in spite of the law change being statewide, because the ratio of criminals to honest people is so high there.</p>
<p>At the same time, the state also allowed for court administrators to search for more than just registered voters to call people in for JD; they can now use drivers license and state ID info.  Again, the only jurisdiction in the state that has actually dug beyond voter rolls to call people for JD is St. Louis City.  So the trick of never registering to vote so as not to get called in for JD is gone, at least in one state.</p>

		<p>Blacks were never to serve on juries, vote or hold any office. That was the way it used to be and that is the way it should be now. Just look at this country due to &#8220;minorities&#8221; taking over where they should never be in the first place. </p>

<p>-I don&rsquo;t know about that.  Look at the O. J. Simpson jury.  In that high-profile case it was WHITES that were specifically excluded, and look at the results.  </p>
<p>All you have to be is a White person accused of a crime with a predominantly non-White jury.  You are almost assured of being convicted, even if the merits of the case indicate beyond a reasonable doubt that you are innocent.  This is another reason why the White crime rate is so low - but you would NEVER know it from looking at AOL, MSNBC, CNN, COURTTV, YAHOO or the Nightly News.  It is as if all or most of the criminals were White.  The media fraudulently paints a picture of Whites as the main perpetrators of crime in this country when the truth is 180 degrees in the other direction.</p>

Blacks have been instructed by black academics to practice jury nullification. They should be excluded.</p>
<p>Here in Buffalo, Johnny Cochran (remember him) succeeded in getting blacks in Buffalo the right of selecting only city residents (with a larger black pool) than to have jurors selected from the county (which would be largely white).</p>
<p>Whites don&rsquo;t get the option to chose only county (largely white) residents as jurors).  </p>

<p>The world&rsquo;s on fire and many blacks are more likely to be the defendent (particularly in the more violent crimes)than a member of the jury.  Is it racist if it&rsquo;s true?</p>

<p>Gordon deserves a round of applause for this common sense idea.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I continue to be amazed at how whites stubbornly cling to this naive and ridiculous notion that a system of government, a system of law and order, a societal foundation that came exclusively from the white brains of our exclusively white Founding Fathers - principles, ideas and concepts that have their roots buried deeply in Anglo-Saxon-Celtic historical traditions - can be applied to, or injected with non-white ethnic groups and then be able to function just as effectively, just as efficiently, just as dependably, and just as reliably as these things used to function when America was 90 plus percent European.  </p>
<p>This is not only a naive way to think, but it&rsquo;s plain stupid. When, and if, whites are reduced to a minority inside their own native homelands - and if whites are then subjugated to majority rule by non-whites, those minorities are going to take a hacksaw to our Constitution, to our Bill of Rights and to our rule of law.  And the interpretations of what&rsquo;s left of those precious documents, which were meant to be gifts passed down to the white posterity of our White Founding Fathers in order to protect us from tyranny, are going to be virulently anti-white in every respect.  </p>
<p>Example:  Voter intimidation at polling precincts is a felony offense, right?   Eric Holder, a black man and our Attorney General, just announced that he will refuse to prosecute the black panther thugs who were video taped doing exactly that, during the 2008 Presidential election.   Reverse the races - and ask yourself whether Holder would prosecute White men who were trying to intimidate black voters?    You bet he would.  It would be national news and the media would be shoving the story in our faces 24/7, 365.  </p>
<p>See my point?    Understand what is at stake, my fellow white AR readers - if we lose our majority status in the nation of our European ancestors?   It will be a nightmare, the likes of which,  no white man, woman or child could possibly dream up on their darkest day.  </p>

		<p> The jury system is part of our Anglo-Saxon traditional legal system, and experience shows it doesn&rsquo;t work too well when non whites serve on juries. Take tort reform, for example. Business interests rail about this topic, and are constantly trying to persuade us to put arbitrary caps on jury awards, but what is the real source of the problem? Tort Reform is supposed to alleviate the problem of &#8220;runaway juries&#8221;-juries that award disproportionately high damage awards, but an examination of this problem reveals that runaway juries are only a problem in venues that are heavily &#8220;majority minority&#8221;. Blacks and to a lesser extent hispanics can&rsquo;t believe that they&rsquo;ve been left with the keys to someone else&rsquo;s vault, and they see the jury system as a way to redistribute white folks money to their racial compadres at no cost to themselves. This is the truth that you&rsquo;ll never hear from the insurance companies and the business roundtable set about tort reform-blacks won&rsquo;t behave on juries, so let&rsquo;s take away everyone&rsquo;s rights, even those of the majority in America that can be trusted upon to behave appropriately when serving on juries. Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t identify the real problem like the little boy who publicly observed that the Emperor had no clothes, and then try to solve it-that would be racist! Better to screw everyone, and take away their constitutional right to a trial by jury, than address and correct the real problem. Once again, the wisdom of our segregationist ancestors is upheld-perhaps they were right to exclude blacks from serving on juries, because with their abundant common sense, they knew what they would do if they got a chance to serve on them. In civil cases, they give away the candy store to black plaintiffs, and in criminal cases, they let black defendants off free, particularly if their victims are white!  Principled, abstract thinking and fair play regardless of race are beyond their capabilities generally. They constantly accuse nonblacks of thinking like they do because they can&rsquo;t conceive of thinking any other way. As Grandma said, &#8220;You can dress them up, but you can&rsquo;t take them to town!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Most states allow lawyers to have a certain number of peremptory challenges, by which they don&rsquo;t have to give a reason for dismissing a potential juror.  If they run out of these (or want to save them) they can dismiss for cause, which is a legal, rational reason that has to be openly stated.  <br/>
A case on the reality TV show First 48 examined a case where a ne-er-do-well, abusive black thug strangled his white ex-girlfriend to death and tried to burn her body in a car.  He had a history of beating the girl and of once hitting her mother.  DNA of both he and the girl were on a make-shift garrote in his apartment.  Cell phone records showed him in the vicinity of the burned car, a witness saw him walking back to his apt., and a bus video proved he wasn&rsquo;t aboard the vehicle, as he claimed as an alibi.  He told the cops a cock-and-bull tale about finding the girl&rsquo;s dead body in his closet and burning it in a panic.  And yet  &mdash;  according to one black juror  &mdash;  she and two others on the panel were at first unwilling to convict!  Luckily, after another day of deliberations, they did.</p>

<p>You raise a great point.  Venue shopping is another reason why the St. Louis City Circuit is so overworked, and why eligible City residents are needed for JD so often.  Any and every civil case where the plaintiffs smell big money that can be shopped to St. Louis and other big cities, using whatever legal pretense there is to claim such areas as legal venues, those suits are brought there.</p>

		<p>Once again somebody who never tried a case does a study about blacks on juries. The conviction rate of any prosecutor who bounces off blacks is about 50% of what it should be. I prosecuted for years and defended for over 20 and I can tell you from expeirence that the best friend of a prosecutor is a black old lady on the panel, especially if it is a non-capitol case and the defendant is black. Most young black men are dis-qualified because thet are awaiting prosecution or already convicted felons. Most elderly blacks have had enough with the brothers. I prosecuted over 50 trials to verdict and I never lost a case with a black person on the panel. They are like enlisted men on court martials, they can smell dung before they see it. I am sorry fellows, blacks aren`t as monolithic and stupid as a lot of you think they are.<br/>

		<p>Claims like this are a complete load. I live in Denver, Colorado, which has both a sizeable black and hispanic population. I was called for jury duty a couple years ago and I was quite surprised to see that at least 95% of the people waiting in the jury room were white. Out of a room of about 300 people, there were at most 10 blacks present. This is the room where people who recieve jury duty notices go to wait to see if they&rsquo;ve been selected for a case. Nobody in that room had been vetted or otherwise whittled out. There were about 20 hispanics in the room. Again, still grossly few. Why? Clearly, black and hispanic residents of this city are making it a point of either to duck or ignore jury summonses. THIS is also whitey&rsquo;s fault? GIVE ME A BREAK! </p>
