			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henry K. Lee, San Francisco Chronicle, July 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Oakland woman was charged Tuesday with murder and robbery in the downtown shooting death of a Virginia man who was killed after being robbed of $17.</p>
<p>Althea Housley, 33, is suspected along with her boyfriend, George Huggins, 24, of accosting Jinghong Kang, 45, on the 1900 block of Webster Street on July 18, authorities said.</p>
<p>Huggins, who also goes by the last name of Hugguins, shot Kang three times &#8220;for no apparent reason&#8221; after the resident of Fairfax, Va., handed over $17, police said in a statement outlining grounds for Housley&rsquo;s arrest.</p>
<p>A surveillance video showed Huggins and Housley walking together on the 1900 block of Webster minutes before Kang was killed, police said. A tipster recognized Housley in the video and alerted police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kang, a father of three sons, had gotten his teeth cleaned the evening of July 18 and had returned to his rental car with a dental hygienist when he was shot, police said. His dental appointment was in advance of a job interview that had been scheduled for the next day at Google in Mountain View.</p>
<p>Huggins and Housley also robbed a couple June 21 on the 1700 block of Telegraph Avenue, police said. The male victim, Ivan Gomez, was shot but survived. His companion was not hurt.</p>

		<p>Oakland is not a safe place to live.  Although if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, that&rsquo;s where &#8220;Epic Beard Man&#8221; beat up the Black that attacked him on the bus.</p>
<p>Asians aren&rsquo;t stupid.  They know that Blacks are dangerous.  They haven&rsquo;t gotten enough media conditioning at this point to be liberal.  If you look back at the early 90&rsquo;s and the Rodney King riots, they were the only ones who actually prepared themselves.  I distinctly remember seeing film clips of Korean businessmen with guns and rifles outside of their businesses and on rooftops.  Imagine if White business owners had done likewise.  They would have been labeled &#8220;racists&#8221;.  They would have been arrested - by White cops - and charged.  Many more Whites I fear, are going to die at the hands of Blacks and Hispanics before the smoke clears.</p>

<p>Before we start with the usual &#8220;Asians have it all together and whites don&rsquo;t &#8221;  business, please remember that whites are the only group that had a majority vote against Obama.  Can&rsquo;t say the same for anybody else, including Asians.  </p>
<p>I am not saying that Republicans are the perfect party to vote for either, but if Asians really have it all together upstairs, then they shouldn&rsquo;t continuously vote for the party that is anti-gun among other things, especially if they want to protect themselves against blacks.</p>
<p>It seems to me that it is overwhelmingly whites that we see at NRA rallies etc&hellip;. Overwhelmingly, whites join the Minutemen, and go to Tea Parties.  Meanwhile, Asians, just like all other minorities, go to rallies that promote themselves as a group, but that don&rsquo;t do any good for the nation overall.</p>
<p>&#8220;I distinctly remember seeing film clips of Korean businessmen with guns and rifles outside of their businesses and on rooftops.&#8221;</p>
<p>I saw quite a few pictures of whites standing outside their homes with rifles during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.</p>

<p>Actually, Mexican gang members patrolled their neighborhoods and did not let any blacks in. Asians and Hispanics have no illusions about blacks. Whites took a beating and blamed themselves.</p>

		<p>To: #3 and #4 above:</p>
<p>I never meant to state that Asians have it all together.  They are not branded as &#8220;racists&#8221; when they get together for self-defense.  And &#8220;Mexican Gang Members&#8221; are not Whites either.  They also are not branded as &#8220;racists&#8221;.  They also can get away with murder as they have been doing.  They don&rsquo;t give a rats backside who brands them what and you know it.  And by the way #3, Louisiana is not Los Angeles.  There are still a few Whites in and around New Orleans with some racial identity although if I&rsquo;m not mistaken many Whites left when they knew there was going to be a flood.  Then the media did their usual thing by criticizing the government and claimed that they didn&rsquo;t do enough for the poor misplaced Blacks.  Did you hear what happened at the Superdome?  Did you hear what happened to the crime rate in Houston when thousands of Blacks and only Blacks were bused there?  Many Blacks also went on a crime spree in New Orleans, robbing and looting.  One bunch even robbed a nursing home filled with senior citizens.  Another was shooting at a rescue helicopter.  Of course no charges of racism against Blacks were filed.</p>

<p>Those were the Korean shopkeepers. The nearby area had been burned and the store owners were protecting themselves from arsonists. They were totally in their right using whatever degree of force they felt was necessary. In the case of arsonists, you can use lethal force.</p>
<p>Gerry Rivers [Geraldo] made a big stink about the Koreans. Gerry is an idiot.</p>
<p>This bantu &#8220;couple&#8221; shot another person too during a similar robbery. The cops need to check out the ballistics and all that. I bet this pair have done a lot of this stuff.</p>
<p>What is it, in Saudi, they chop chop armed robbers. Even if no death you get chop chop. Good reason for it too.</p>

		<p>Another example: completely worthless thug kills scientist. Our country needs scientists, and needs to purge itself of thugs. But what does our government do? Would bet that this worthless thug has received thousands of dollars of government assistance, to help her eat and reproduce, so that our future generations will have lots of young thugs. And, for all this, a big thank you to President Obama!</p>

		<p>Asians and Whites need to be more proactive and take matters into their own hands. Buy a gun, learn to use it and carry it. CAr jackings of rental cars in South Florida resulted is several tourists being murdered, raped- you know the ususal passtimes of many Blacks.<br>
Florida has CCW so thugs don&rsquo;t know whether a potential victim is armed or not. Rental cars had markings on the license tags that identified them as such. Tourists are unarmed since they can&rsquo;t carry weapons on aircraft ergo a perfect mark for dah youfs. Once the markings were removed, the carjacking incidents dropped precipitously .<br>
IN my state getting a CWW is virtually impossible.  The situation puts us in the same position as were the Florida visitors.<br>
The lawmakers aren&rsquo;t interested in keeping us safe.  They know perfectly well that criminals couldn&rsquo;t care less about &#8220;LAWS&#8221;.</p>

		<p>While on holiday in USA with my young teenage sons recently I stayed in San Francisco for several nites &hellip;I of course avoided Oakland having been there before in the mid 80s and meeting assorted weirdos on Telegraph avenue and some of the crack smoking bros on the subway.Luckily I made it out unscathed<br>
but a lot more racially aware.<br>
Its a pity that then and even now  guidebooks for overseas tourists are all so PC and not willing to tell it as it is&hellip;ie,not the type of place to be wandering around as a tourist at nite or even day&hellip;could possibly prevent a  few muggings or worse if it was written a la `The Amren Way`   <br>
As for Asians and blacks&hellip;like oil and water<br>
Someone mentioned the epic beard man video in a previous post<br>
For a bit of comic relief I found this other fight on a San<br>
Fran bus between a black lady and Chinese lady quite  hilarious<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rm4SazjKsQ" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rm4SazjKsQ</a>   </p>
<p>While I never got to see anything like this riding the buses<br>
in downtown San fran I watched one large obnoxious acting black  man try to snuggle up next to a young white girl one nite.She got off next stop.Good move.   <br>

<p>We all have our opinions here on AR, but I surely disagree with yours. No group is more dangerous to Whites than blacks, muslims of any color may be close, or even a bit more so, but for outright, threat and potential violence! BLACKS win,hands down. </p>

		<p>When on city streets, be as cautious of your surroundings as you would in a forest overrun with grizzlies.  Constantly look around you with a forbidding frown, and make direct eye contact with anyone who looks at you.  Mugging sleazeballs are not looking for a fight, but for a distracted, weak-looking, easy mark.  Low-class, low-IQ blacks are like children with toy guns.  They shoot them just because they have them in their hands.  Don&rsquo;t even let such people anywhere near you.  Hurry back into a building or into your car.  If you can&rsquo;t carry a gun, have pepper spray, and use it if necessary. </p>

They have the cold blank stare of sociopathic killers.<br>
They each deserve a date with the needle, but the liberals out here won&rsquo;t allow it. Instead they will go to prison for life on the taxpayers dime, where they will live like kings and queens. All needs will be taken care of for them and they will have celebrity status.</p>

<p><br>
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING! Now Whites and Asians are supposed to carry enough cash to buy off black assailants in the hope that if you give them enough they will let you LIVE? What a sniveling comment. </p>
<p>Further, how much would you recommend that White people carry? $100? $1000? What would satiate the hunger of these killers, or do you see that the more money, the greater the danger? More money from a victim translates in a better ability to flee, more resources to conceal you tracks and a greater hunger to do it again after the money runs out. Give me a break!</p>

		<p> I notice there is no mention of the races of the victim or the thugs in the story. But then, with photos included, there is no need for any. The Asian man had had his teeth cleaned and was getting ready for a job interview; the two black ne&rsquo;er-do-wells were supporting a drug habit by robbing people who work for their living. And Barack Obama says we need a &#8220;dialogue on race&#8221;! How about starting with incidents like this one?</p>

I agree.  My husband an aeronautical engineer with a PHD from MIT and I moved to Mountain View for his first job out of college back in 1965. It was all White Americans then.</p>
<p>The entire N. California IT industry is now in the hands of Asian and Indian immigrants who are far less qualified than the Whites they replaced.  Their academic credentials and employment resumes are often bogus, especially the Indians.</p>

		<p>@anonymous:</p>
<p>CCW permits are almost impossible to come by in the San Francisco Bay Area, where this crime took place, unless you are extremely well-connected. </p>
<p>There is also a push in the state legislature to make it illegal to openly carry firearms (it is now legal to openly carry firearms, but they must be unloaded). </p>
<p>It is also legally perilous to carry a firearm in the passenger compartment of a car in California. </p>
<p>So while guns can be used to defend a home, or a business, you&rsquo;re putting yourself in legal peril if you choose to carry one while traveling through a dangerous neighborhood. </p>
<p>I suppose this is an example of what Sam Francis called anarcho-tyranny. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m noting this so that Bay Area readers will be aware that they need to be aware of the kind of legal problems that can arise if one chooses to carry a gun. </p>

No, the most dangerous group to Whites is other Whites.  Exactly how long would acts like this be tolerated if not for traitor Whites?  How much power would Blacks have?</p>

<p>Caramba!. What a callous thing to say. <br>
Maybe instead of sending them to prison, why don&rsquo;t we give the two mayates the patriotism award for &#8220;saving&#8221; one (1) job for an American? President Obama would be pleased to present that award in the Rose Garden.</p>
<p>Did it occur to you that for years our kids have been &#8220;educated&#8221; in public systems that have lowered the bar and have watered down the curricula in the hope that the people &#8220;of color&#8221; would <br>
&#8220;achieve&#8221;? They haven&rsquo;t and White kids, especially boys who are not attending college in the same numbers as are girls, are leaving High School woefully unprepared for higher education.?</p>
<p><br>
You think that Mr. Kang was a bigger threat than those two? Are you living in the same country as the rest of us? Would you feel the same way (GOD FORBID!) had it been a member of your family instead of Mr. Kang?<br>
When was the last time that someone was murdered by Korean Americans?</p>

		<p>Yes, Chinese and Indians on H-1b visas are displacing white Americans who used to make a good living in high-tech industries, but who is hiring them?  Who constantly lobbies congress and lies to them, saying that they can&rsquo;t find Americans with the right skills?  Who are the congressmen who continue to swallow this line of bull and expand the H-1b visa program every time their handlers order it done?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s other white men, who apparently think a shrinking white middle class is good for the country.  It&rsquo;s white men who think that it is just great that white, English-speaking high-school students won&rsquo;t even consider a science or engineering degree in college, because they will not ever be able to get work in their field here, in what used to be their own country.  Graduating with a degree in chemistry or physics with a mountain of student loan debt - which not even bankruptcy will eliminate - they will be lucky to get work stocking shelves at Wal Mart.  They&rsquo;re not stupid; they&rsquo;re not going to do it.  I have 79 US and foreign patents in processes for fabricating microelectronics parts, and my last work in my field was - ironically - in Shenzhen, China.</p>
<p>I looked at the contents of my own wallet after reading this article; I&rsquo;m carrying less cash than Khang was when he was murdered, while I&rsquo;m wearing flip-flops, a free &#8220;Bolder Boulder 10K race t-shirt and cutoffs.  I can theorize why both Khang and Gomez, the other man they robbed were shot.  It wasn&rsquo;t about the money.  Seventeen dollars isn&rsquo;t much, and perps like these two know most folks don&rsquo;t carry lots of cash with them these days.  They shot these two guys because they like shooting folks.  When taking everything someone has with him isn&rsquo;t enough, why the heck not take away everything he&rsquo;s ever going to have?  Does anyone imagine that the deaths of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsome in the Knoxville Horror was some sort of &#8220;unintended consequence&#8221; of a vicious gang-rape?  It wasn&rsquo;t.  Murder was the object, and the rape was incidental.</p>
<p>These two perps represent the face of the new America.  Their fecund reproduction is subsidized by money extorted from you, the reader, me, my wife, and Mr. Gomez, once he recovers from his gunshot injury and returns to work.  Their food stamps and health care?  Ditto.  When we can&rsquo;t be forced to pay them to replace us fast enough, we&rsquo;re killed like Khang, Christian and Newsome.  The law eventually punishes some of the Lemarickus Davidsons and Althea Housleys, but their enablers consider them expendable, like ants.  These enablers are whites.  Whites who do not understand the concept of &#8220;blowback&#8221; or that the temporal dimension of amoral Clausewitzian warfare they lead against us also applies to themselves and their own families.</p>

		<p>Gunrunner: I am not saying that victims owe money to robbers, but the victim would be alive today if he had more than $17 on him. The same thing happened to me many years ago. I lost all of the moolah on me, which amounted to all of the overtime pay that I had earned that night.  The black still had my wallet. I asked him for it back. He threw it for a distance of over 20 feet. I caught it.</p>

		<p>Before anyone jumps on Peejay in Frisco, remember CCW permits are almost NEVER issued in San Francisco, or in any of the 9 Bay Area counties. Muggings by men armed with guns, however, are routine. </p>

		<p>When-oh when-will we fix the schools!? Education stops crime! Education! I pray that Race To The Top,the effort of Arne Duncan,the esteemed Secretary of Education(who used to play basketball with blacks) will be allowed to fix our schools! Then we will regain our place as the best educated nation in the world! The two young people pictured above-what a waste of intellectual capital! The woman might haver been another Condi Rice,the man a marine biologist! Or they might have been accomplished rappers. Anyway,the mothers of these two youths have lost them,and they will have to live with the knowledge of what they have done. Certainly a far harsher punishment than mere jail! Tragedy for all concerned. And the Chinese guy too.</p>

LOL!!! Leave one &#8220;p&#8221; out of the last word. That would be closer to accurate.</p>

		<p>#1/#21 Peejay.  In college, I was robbed and shot by a Black and all he got from my wallet was 20$ (3 more bucks than this dude).  I hope that shows you that your little theory is inaccurate, or shall I provide links to the articles about the incident which provoked my racial awakening?</p>

		<p>Gen Lee:$20 isnt poo now, and it hasnt been for quite a few years. In Oakland, a black was robbed by another black, and he was shot because he didnt have enough moolah on him, probably less than $50.He lost all of his intestines, probably from infection.</p>

		<p>What about all the multinationals in USA that assemble basically all their products in countries with cheap labor?  Such as Nike?  I have rarely, if ever, seen a Nike product that was assembled in Canada or USA.   </p>
<p>I am sure the amount of budget that Nike pays to factories in China or other countries with cheap labor is more than ten times the amount of combined salaries that IBM, Apple and Google pays all their Korean employees.</p>
