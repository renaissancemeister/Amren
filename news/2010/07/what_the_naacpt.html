			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Weissberg, American Thinker, July 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The recent dust-up between the NAACP and the Tea Partiers over charges of &#8220;racism&#8221; appears to be yet one more instance of blacks accusing whites of insensitivity, real or imagined. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} This disagreement is, to use Thomas Sowell&rsquo;s words, an unbridgeable conflict of visions: the Tea Party&rsquo;s agenda, even stripped of any racial component, contravenes the NAACP&rsquo;s raison d&rsquo;Ãªtre, so when the NAACP complains about insensitivities, it is just saying, &#8220;You intend to destroy us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Begin by recognizing that the post-1960s civil rights agenda has been the single most powerful force in expanding Washington power. Nothing comes even remotely close. During WWII, Washington set prices, rationed consumer goods, and limited business profits, but this infringement was correctly understood as temporary and was universally welcomed as vital to national survival (and it was soon ended). Neither the environmental movement nor consumer protection legislation has penetrated so deeply into the everyday life of Americans.</p>
<p>Documenting this expansion is endless. In education, for example, the push to integrate America&rsquo;s schools has affected the lives of millions, especially those who fled cities to avoid forced busing, while judicial degrees have shaped everything from tax rates to the racial composition of school staffs. Urban demographics were radically altered by forced integration, and this remains true today. The 1964 Civil Rights Act brought federal intervention into local restaurants and movie houses and even constrained people&rsquo;s ability to choose their neighbors. The 1965 Voting Rights Act and subsequent extensions now make every city and town in America vulnerable to Justice Department oversight if their election system slights minority representation. Employment-based affirmative action has exploded from a narrow presidential directive targeting federal government contractors to a bureaucratic colossus. There is scarcely a person alive, from professors to blue-collar cops and firefighters, whose life-chances have not been shaped by government race policy. There is no escape  &mdash;  those in rural Idaho seeking a mortgage will probably experience the repercussions of the government&rsquo;s push to promote home ownership among blacks and Hispanics.   </p>
<p>Yet, thousands of civil rights successes aside, the political appetites of groups like the NAACP seem insatiable. It is no exaggeration to say that they believe that government is sufficiently powerful, if only vigorously prodded, to level outcomes across nearly all of human existence. {snip} [If] one lawsuit does not bring racially proportionate equality of admission to law schools, file two, and if that comes up short, file four, and eventually, it is believed, victory will arrive. Scarcely a day passes without some civil rights group going to court to challenge an exam that allegedly hinders black job applicants or demanding that Washington forcefully intervene to protect poor blacks from allegedly discriminatory financial practices.</p>
<p>{snip} Put more formally, given what is already on the books and vigorously enforced, new civil rights measures serve only to expand government, with scant payoff for intended beneficiaries. The point of diminishing returns on political pressuring was reached long ago. In a nutshell, the very existence of the Tea Party is a message to the NAACP: Stop.</p>
<p>{snip} [What] makes the civil rights agenda so contrary to the principles of limited government, over and above its ceaseless character, is its penchant for invading what was heretofore politically off-limits. It is one thing to demand free universal medical care, but quite another to attempt to micromanage the workplace to root out any vestiges of alleged discrimination. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are also rules about non-job social events, so, for example, a firm that favors golf outings may be guilty of racial discrimination if its black employees prefer basketball to golf. A firm might also risk lawsuits if refuses to promote a white person who has a black spouse or if the white employee socializes with blacks, or if the firm&rsquo;s insurance policy had a race-related illness as an excluded existing precondition. The list of prohibitions and requirements is not only far-reaching and murky, but navigating them requires legal staffs trained in the equivalent of Talmudic interpretation. Who would have ever guessed that firms must now consider shaving bumps when setting grooming standards? Or must inquire about the race of an employee&rsquo;s friends or spouse before announcing layoffs? No, these are not hypothetical illustrations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Tea Party fans are not anti-black or anti-civil rights; they certainly do not favor repealing civil rights legislation or enfeebling the Justice Department. They just prefer limited government to pursuing an aim  &mdash;  racial equality  &mdash;  that appears unreachable. It is one thing to expand government during wartime, when national survival is at stake, or to achieve a worthy and reachable goal; but to empower Big Brother and accomplish nothing other than bigger government is hardly an acceptable sacrifice.</p>
<p>When confronted with the inevitable charge of racism, Tea Party folk should resist the urge to fight the battle on these acrimonious grounds. Battling a civil rights group over &#8220;racism&#8221; is an unwinnable, pointless battle. Blacks will always claim the high ground of moral authority to define &#8220;racism.&#8221; {snip} It is, moreover, about time that the virtues of limited government enter the public debate next time the NAACP or its sympathizers demand yet more government intrusion into private life.</p>
<p>Of the utmost importance, African-Americans should be reminded that, after all, they are a minority, and the purpose of limited government is to prevent tyranny, especially the tyranny of the majority over the minority. In the long run, African-Americans  &mdash;  like all Americans  &mdash;  should dread an out-of-control government no matter how seductive that government&rsquo;s mission. {snip} There is an oft-repeated Jefferson quote that captures this dilemma exactly: &#8220;A government big enough to give you everything you want is strong enough to take everything you have.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dust-up is about power and tyranny, not insults.<br>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t this approaching an unpleasant topic? Whites want low-taxes and &#8216;limited government&rsquo; because they are &#8216;racist&rsquo; and black want high-taxation (on whites) and a strong government because they are racists too. </p>
<p>Jared Taylor might say, if it wasn&rsquo;t for integration, we wouldn&rsquo;t have this unseemly problem and intractable impasse.  </p>

		<p>The NAACP makes most of its money from its LDF, and it makes most of its money from remuneration from the Federal government for bringing civil rights cases.  (CRA &#8216;65 allows this recompensation, based on the assumption that most civil rights victims were poorer blacks who couldn&rsquo;t afford lawyers).  Therefore, the NAACP&rsquo;s money stream is very vulnerable to even minute and seemingly insignificant changes in public policy   &mdash;   If, for example, the Civil Rights Act of 1965 were amended to instruct the Federal judiciary to use intermediate scrutiny instead of strict scrutiny on race, and if the reforms disallowed &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; as grounds to bring a CR lawsuit, the NAACP is out of business within a year.</p>
<p>While that last sentence seems like legal-technocratic gibberish, you lawyers know how profound a reform it would be.  If you&rsquo;re an NAACP-LDF lawyer reading this, you interpret it as a knife in the heart ready to be twisted.</p>
<p>As an aside, the Federal judiciary got so insane over deseg in the early 1980s (those years being the peak of Federal court &#8220;consent decrees&#8221; for deseg, tax hikes, the Kansas City affair, etc), that the Federal judge who already had the Cleveland school district under a deseg order then turned right around and put its high school sports programs under the same thing, b/c in his opinion, the baseball teams were too white and the basketball teams were too black.</p>

		<p>One of the main problems with American blacks is that the average IQ is 85, with 20% having IQ&rsquo;s of 70 and below.  Many are simply unable to think logically and, like small children, want everything they desire and want it NOW.                    It should have been enough to give blacks equal opportunities.  But, instead, the nation has acted as though every last denizen of the ghetto must be college-educated, have a top-level job, and live in an upscale, ethnically mixed neighborhood.  Whites must be forced to conduct their activities of daily living among a group that consists of a mere 12% of the population.  Yet, a great many blacks now appear to be in worse condition than they were before.  Many live in rotting cities.  They&rsquo;re uneducated, jobless, drug-addicted, unwed, and in constant danger of crime.  They&rsquo;re pariahs to the black middle and upper classes.  <br>
The Tea Party and other emerging groups may deny concerns with racial problems, but we all know such troubles are on everyone&rsquo;s minds.  </p>

		<p>I suspect blacks would be less enthusiastic about progressive taxes if we went to a system where anyone who does not or cannot pay taxes would have to contribute to the National Good by donating time.  If I pay 20% of my income to the Feds in the form of income tax then perhaps someone else who does not pay anything should &#8220;contribute&#8221; 20% of their theoretical work day in the form of unpaid labor.  40 hours a week X 20% would be 8 hours a week or one day a week.  They could guard the border,  work in hospitals cleaning bed pans, or pick up trash on the side of the road.    </p>

		<p>The NAACP&rsquo;s position is almost laughable.  &#8220;You want to destroy us???&#8221;  I&rsquo;m a proud Tea Party supporter, and the fact is, we don&rsquo;t even THINK about the NAACP; I believe that&rsquo;s what their basic beef is about.  We frankly don&rsquo;t care one way or the other about what the NAACP&rsquo;s agenda is; we have our own goals and aspirations, and we welcome people of all colors and backgrounds who support our G&rsquo;s and A&rsquo;s.  It&rsquo;s as simple as that.  The NAACP is P&rsquo;O&rsquo;d because they aren&rsquo;t getting any attention or special treatment by the Tea Party folks.  That&rsquo;s right - we say that if you want to join us, please do - but understand there will be no special treatment given to ANYONE, be it blacks, whites, browns, gays, or disabled.  We do equality, not kowtowing to any group.  So if you want equality, join us; if you don&rsquo;t, go back to your special interest groups and stay there.</p>

		<p>Take a gander at what the TP&rsquo;ers are flipping over. I knew it. You watch, they will run this guy in 2012 for POTUS. He has more or less said it. These Whites are falling all over this guy and will put him up to show they are not &#8220;racist&#8221; and try to get some black votes.  Reminds me of Obama and his speech at the Democratic Convention and how he became the darling of the MSM and White sheeple everywhere. Read this excerpt. Think this guy isn&rsquo;t arrogant?<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>Nicknamed &#8220;The Hermanator,&#8221; Cain has more than 17,000 fans of his Facebook page, 5,000 Twitter fans and 45,000 members in his Intelligent Thinkers Movement. He is urging supporters to sign up for his political action committee and help raise funds for conservative candidates for the 2010 election. He said support for that effort will help him gauge his backing for a 2012 bid.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can get that kind of encouragement in trying to change Congress, it will be great encouragement in terms of possibly helping me make that decision as to whether or not I can do this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re developing a ground game all over this country. We&rsquo;ll have a way to mobilize all of those people.&#8221;</p>
<p>His supporters have launched a &#8220;Draft Herman Cain for President 2012&#8221; effort to develop teams of volunteers and build a grass-roots base for a presidential campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s been growing like gangbusters,&#8221; Cain said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s the sort of thing I&rsquo;ll be looking at in the next couple of months in making this decision.&#8221; </p>

<p>Well, sorry TeaPartyPatriot, I truly mistrust the TP&rsquo;ers. After seeing this I had to vomit. They run from the word &#8220;racist&#8221; like any group I have ever witnessed. They mistakenly will run this guy in 2012. </p>
<p>No, Mr Cain, Obama doesn&rsquo;t need to fear you, Whites need to fear you and the TP&rsquo;ers are on your bandwagon. Read the WHOLE article! Maybe Amren can post it tomorrow.</p>

		<p> The wimps at American Thinker are clueless. Both the Tea Party Movement and the concept of limited government are implicitly white. The NAACP is right to resist both-their success means the doom of the NAACP and all that it stands for. Blacks have tried and failed to assimilate to white culture in America despite 400 years of trying. They can&rsquo;t compete successfully as a group for the goodies of life without a stacked deck-the type of stacked deck provided by affirmative action and civil rights laws. As far as limited government is concerned, they think government was created to redistribute wealth.</p>

		<p>After it became obvious that ending racial discrimination against blacks would not achieve racial equality, the civil rights movement began to push for discrimination in favor of blacks.  This was a clandestine acknowledgment that the advocates of slavery and segregation had been right about innate racial ability differences.  </p>

<p>Big Government will ultimately be the ONLY answer  &mdash;   &#8216;acceptable sacrifice&rsquo; to achieve &#8216;racial equality.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Triumph of Big Brother was (and is) the main goal and always has been. </p>
<p>Empowering Big Brother and imposing an authoritarian police-state government IS the desire of the hostile elite that control the government and media. </p>
<p>What better strategy to divert the attention of blacks and Whites than to pit one racial group against another (or several) and let them scream it out about something that has no solution (racial equality)  &mdash;  until the government &#8216;is forced&rsquo; to step in with its own solution, which is, naturally, More Government.  More government &#8216;crack-downs&rsquo; that is, more Hate Speech laws, more forced equality meaning more Section 8 housing and &#8216;integration&rsquo; moved into your area featuring urban blacks.  Complaints will be dealt with quickly, harshly and without mercy.</p>
<p>As an example:</p>
<p>The Tea Party has been fifth-columned and is worthless  &mdash;  seems they&rsquo;re spending their days twisting themselves into knots proving &#8220;They&rsquo;re Not Racist!&#8221;</p>
<p>Toss that out (You Tea Partiers Are Racist!),  tie up their resources, energy and time and divert their goals (they did have goals, didn&rsquo;t they?) trying to prove the absurd notion of being &#8216;inclusive&rsquo; and not strictly about White interests. Gimme a Break.</p>
<p>They might as well be trying to find the end of Pi.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Tea Party leaders will address charges of racism&hellip; the event features 13 speakers, with at least 8 speakers being persons of color&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Really?  I am one of these wasps with colonial roots you speak of, and I am proud of it (I am from the South too).</p>
<p>I once dated an Italian/Irish guy from NYC, and it didn&rsquo;t last long.  One of the reasons was he kept saying things similar to what you are saying.  </p>
<p>I asked him why his Catholic ancestors came to a &#8220;sorry British Protestant country&#8221; if we don&rsquo;t handle things very well, according to him.  Why didn&rsquo;t Italians form their own colony somewhere instead of coming here?  I could have slapped him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like getting into these inter-ethnic white squabbles, but I take umbrage when white people who are descended from the immigrant groups who came over from the 1840&rsquo;s onward (the people who are not descended from the English founding stock), criticize my people when we are the ones who built this country.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t your ancestors form their own Catholic, or German, or Italian, or Eastern European colony somewhere instead of coming to a sorry waspy country like America?  </p>
<p>And I disagree with your premise anyways.  Most of the people who care about what is happening to this country racially tend to be waspy Southerners, at least from my experience.</p>

		<p>I basically see these accusations of Racism by the Socialist NAACP as a desperate reaction, very likely with collusion from the Democrat&rsquo;s hierarchy, to the steep decline in Obama&rsquo;s popularity which is now well below 50 percent. The problem with this cheap tactic, is that that the Democrats might galvanize the Black vote, but little else will happen. The Democrats already get 9 out of 10 Black votes, but these racism charges will only serve to backfire horribly during this November&rsquo;s Congressional elections because the non Black population has seen nothing but deteriorating standards of living and they will vote with their wallets. At best the Democrats will only hold the Senate, but now it is becoming more likely that they will loose both Houses of Congress. As the Socialist mainstream media desperately tries to vilify the Tea Party movement, the public will repudiate the Socialistic Democrats and turn more towards the Right Wing media. I view these events in a positive light and I look forward to the repudiation of Obama&rsquo;s radical policies this November.</p>

		<p>Hey, Anonymous, I&rsquo;ve never heard of this Cain guy, and nobody I know in the Tea Party group has either.  I believe in running a campaign that we can WIN   &mdash;   and to that end I hope it&rsquo;s Romney for President and Bobby Jindal for VP.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary to defeat a black with a black, especially not with a black nobody&rsquo;s even heard of.  That&rsquo;s a crock.</p>

		<p>Courteny, well said.  I have, alas, met plenty of whites who are indifferent to the extinguishment of the white race and Western culture in general, not to mention our colonial English culture. The popular culture that lifts up ghetto pathology and denigrates the extraordinary founding ideals of our nation and the soil from which they sprang is very popular. The anger over immigration is nice to see but it&rsquo;s late in the day materializing and STILL MCAmnesty in Arizona is in play in the forthcoming election and Obama can get away with taking affirmative action to keep the borders open. </p>
<p>I bet at least 85% of Americans don&rsquo;t recognize Islam itself as a mortal threat and would be averse to attacking it as the politically subversive doctrine that it is or expelling Muslims from this and other Western lands.</p>
<p>The majority of Americans are adrift and don&rsquo;t even care about their children let alone the culture of their ancestors, be it from England or some other country in Europe.<br>
