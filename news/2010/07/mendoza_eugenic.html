			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Levin, Cutting Edge, June 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>California Assemblyman Tony Mendoza has been stalled in his effort to pass legislation the deaf community feels will launch a eugenic campaign against them. {snip}</p>
<p>California eugenics was a system of eliminating unwanted bloodlines of those who were deemed &#8220;social misfits&#8221; in the twisted pseudoscience. Those targeted included such groups as the poor, prostitutes, Asians, whites with brown hair, those needing glasses, the deaf and many others. The radical early twentieth century social engineering plan became entrenched decades before Hitler came to power. Hitler emulated the California state statutes in his own Nazi eugenic crusade. Ultimately, some 66,000 Americans under 27 state laws were forcibly sterilized for a variety of eugenic reasons, with about a third to a half of the victims in California. That state&rsquo;s legislature has already issued a formal apology for targeting groups for extinction.</p>
<p>Mendoza&rsquo;s eugenic bill, known as AB2072, {snip} calls for all newborns to be screened for hearing problems; and if found to be deaf, their parents are to be given an &#8220;informative brochure&#8221; describing the options. The problem, complain large numbers of deaf people, is that the brochure is under the control of the well-financed cochlear implant industry, the audiology profession and various Alexander Graham Bell foundations  &mdash;  all of which are determined to see deaf culture, and its distinctive American Sign Language, disappear. Alexander Graham Bell was a pioneer of American eugenics. Cochlear implants are controversial medical devices that augment hearing and, in many ways, tend to do away with the need to communicate using American Sign Language.</p>
<p>For their part, the generation-to-generation deaf are passionately determined to keep their special identity which depends upon visual communication, including sign language. They have fought back with mass protests and letter writing campaigns, as well as STOP AB2072 Internet sites and t-shirts. The deaf community also brought in the historical expertise of Edwin Black, author of the award-winning eugenics book War Against the Weak, which chronicled the deep relationship between California eugenicists and the Third Reich.</p>
<p>Last week, Black lectured on eugenics in Sacramento to more than 500 members of the deaf community, including many who traveled from around the state to attend the event and thousands more who attended online. {snip}</p>
<p>The following day, June 16, 2010, at a mass rally was held by the deaf community on the steps of the California State Capitol with speakers, including Black, giving perspective on why AB2072 would endanger the existence of the generation-to-generation deaf. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Mendoza Eugenics seems to be supported,&#8221; explained Black, &#8220;by the medical industry that stands to profit from the cochlear implants buttressed by passionate, hearing parents of deaf children who have no connection to the traditional deaf community. These loving but distressed parents see deafness as an unexpected family tragedy. At the same time, the deaf are seen by Mendoza as defective Americans whose affliction requires American Sign Language. Mendoza believes neither should exist in the next generation of Californians. He thinks the deaf can be legislated away.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Mendoza&rsquo;s office issued an email that audiologists are &#8220;doctors&#8221; and competent providers of medical advice. Audiologists, in truth, are &#8220;technicians&#8221; who, in large measure, screen for hearing problems; but they are not doctors, cannot diagnose or offer medical advice. The relevant medical doctors are ear, nose and throat specialists, also known as otolaryngologists. The fact that Mendoza sits on the Health Committee but did not know that audiologists are not trained or licensed to render medical opinions caused one observer to refer to Mendoza as &#8220;incompetent.&#8221; Discussions among the deaf began about recalling him.</p>
<p>Nor was progress made when a deaf contingent met at a nearby hotel restaurant with advocates of the measure. One pro-AB2072 mother said her son&rsquo;s cochlear implants were so successful, &#8220;you can&rsquo;t even tell my son is deaf.&#8221; That was taken as an offensive remark by the deaf adults who celebrate their status. During the get-together when an effort was made to explain California&rsquo;s eugenic past and its impact on deaf people, AB2072 advocates abruptly stopped the presentation, asserting they did not want to know details of the historical past and preferred &#8220;to negotiate.&#8221; The deaf, however, were fundamentally unwilling to negotiate away their group&rsquo;s continuing existence, but said they would listen to suggestions for fixing the legislation.</p>
<p>Political observers familiar with the Health Committee process predicted the bill was dead for this session unless it could be revived before July 2, 2010. {snip}<br>

		<p>Special interest groups are so selfish.  Deafness is not an advantage but a handicap.  The sooner a child&rsquo;s deafness or hearing loss is discovered the sooner intervention can begin.  That might include correcting the defect, an implant or teaching the child and his family sign language so that they can begin communicating as soon as possible.  The norm is to hear.  Only a selfish person would deny a child the ability to develop all their facilties to the fullest.  How dare a deaf adult try to stunt the future prospects of a baby!</p>
<p>I have a very close relative with profound hearing loss who was, unfortunately, diagnosed long after he began grammar school.  His parents went through so much grief trying to find out why his speach was delayed and unintelligible.  Yes, even in theis day and age, hearing loss can go undiscovered.  The sooner it is discovered the better.</p>

<p>Wait, so deaf people don&rsquo;t want deafness to be cured? Really? I&rsquo;m just confused. Why is being deaf something to be celebrated? </p>
<p>What about blind people? If you cure blind children, they&rsquo;ll never learn how to read brail! You&rsquo;ll commit genocide on brail culture! Curing blindess is akin to the Nazis! </p>
<p>This is so stupid it sounds like something out of the Onion.</p>

		<p>Basically, the deaf lobby is afraid of losing their already limited power and want to force deafness on more children. What a bunch of ridiculously immature and selfish people.</p>

		<p>Decades ago I predicted state-funded Eugenics would one day return, this time for financial reasons rather than reasons of &#8220;racial supremacy&#8221;.  In the UK the gov&rsquo;t is already willing to pay the cost of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) to screen for such things as cystic fibrosis.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8706961" rel="nofollow">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8706961</a></p>
<p>Why?  Simple.  It saves state-funded healthcare services an enormous amout of money in healthcare bills by humanely preventing the births of people doomed to a sickly life and an early grave.  As the costs of these technologies decline one day HMOs here will undoubtedly likewise pick up the tab.</p>
<p>Life will get really interesting once every allele, SNP and CNV has been &#8220;mapped&#8221; and their functions catalogued.  People with brains and money will then avail themselves of this knowledge to produce mentally and physically superior children, who will then go on to become the future rulers of this planet; Hollywood-inspired nonsense notwithstanding.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been amazed by the fact the people who (as a group) stand the most to gain from Eugenics are the ones who are most dead set against it!  Istvan is correct: these deaf people are selfish (and short-sighted).  As I pointed out on a similar thread to this awhile back, real parents would want their children to grow up to be better than themselves.  That&rsquo;s called &#8220;evolution&#8221;.</p>
<p>I do not know what Mr. Mendoza&rsquo;s motives are for doing this, but this type of legislation should be lauded and supported.</p>

		<p>Notice that whenever liberals discuss eugenics they always use two words, <i>psuedo-science</i> and <i>Nazi</i>. These words are used to prevent rational discussion of eugenics.</p>
<p>1-Eugenics is not a psuedo-science (nor is it a science). It is a governmental policy like speed limits or taxes. </p>
<p>2-The Nazi eugenics program was mainly aimed at mental defectives who were instutionalized. It allowed these people to be released and lead normal lives. This sterilization consisted of vasectomies and fallopian tubal ligatures. In any event, it had no connection with Nazi policies toward Jews. </p>
<p>Personally, I am opposed to eugenic policies, mainly on Libertarian grounds. I do not want governments mutilating peoples reproductive organs. I feel the benefits can be achieved by birth control and voluntary sterilizations.</p>

		<p>Aside from promoting disability as a culture to be celebrated, the deaf community masquerades under guise of children&rsquo;s rights by saying cochlear implant surgery should be the child&rsquo;s choice that s/he can make upon becoming a legal adult (age 18). The problem with this is that cochlear implants only work in cases of hearing loss where the auditory nerve is still intact - years of deafness atrophy this nerve, also the child misses the critical age to learn spoken language. </p>

		<p>What parents of a deaf child decide to do with that child and with the prospect of future children is between them and their doctor.  It is not a matter for public policy or the business of militant pressure groups.</p>
<p>You would think the deaf would pine for a world where their affliction was no more, but that is not the case.  The only group in the history of the world who think it is cool not to exist is the White man.</p>

		<p>As the child of deaf parents, I find myself conflicted on this issue. On the one hand, I can understand where the deaf commuinty are coming from with their point of view. They want to be accepted the way they are. Being of course fluent in ASL, it is a beautiful way to communicate. I&rsquo;ve asked my parents if they were good candidates for the cochlear implant, would they do it, and both responded with a resounding NO!</p>
<p>On the other hand, had I been born with hearing problems and this technology were available at the time, I think I would have resented my parents had they not given me the opportunity to hear and speak properly.</p>
<p>I can understand a parent wanting their child to be like them, but in this case I agree with poster #1&hellip; it&rsquo;s a bit selfish on the deaf parents part to deny their children the ability to hear. </p>
<p>HOWEVER,I do know that deaf children attend my daughters school, so being deaf in this day and age is not like it was when my parents were growing up in the 50&rsquo;s, where they were something to be ashamed of and sent off to a &#8220;special&#8221; school. In those times, they were often forced to learn to &#8220;talk&#8221; and somtimes even forbidden to use sign language. Things have changed since then, and being deaf is not the worse thing in the world.</p>

		<p>Wait&hellip;why would the cochlear implant industry want deaf infants eliminated?  Apparently, this deaf lobby is claiming enemies even where they don&rsquo;t exist.  It reminds me of blacks who claim that the abortion rights people are trying to eliminate blacks because so many black women get abortions.  Yet, if someone actually tried to stop these women, the howl would be that their rights were being denied!  Do such interest groups fear that the &#8220;eliminators&#8221; will next come after not just fetuses but also those already born?  Adults even?</p>

		<p>The obvious answer here is also the simplest:</p>
<p>Fine!</p>
<p>No more ASL teaching or schools/classes for the deaf.  No more paid selection of defective embryos.  No more ASL conversant speakers in government or EMS or any other federally or state mandated positions.<br>
  <br>
No more selective &#8216;impaired&rsquo; bias advantage in hiring.</p>
<p>You can compete equally and pay for it -all-.  Because there is absolutely nothing wrong with you.</p>
<p>And oh, /by the way/, when we bypass &#8216;bionics&rsquo; to start to create baseline 120+ IQ healthy children as a standard of raising our societal common understandings without such fringe beliefs as you espouse?</p>
<p>You can bet your last dollar that we won&rsquo;t &#8216;eugenically&rsquo; interfere with your life choices in any way.</p>
<p>Lest you wake up with smart kids that find your actions in perpetuating their loss of 1/5th of their primary life sensory experience to be &#8216;really rude&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Our sole hope is to outsmart our problems and particularly our racial differences on the way to controlled population loads and -massive- investment in green science.</p>
<p>If Japan and their crime rate is any indication, the place to start is with smarter people and GE will get us there as nothing else &#8216;environment vs. hereditary&rsquo; ever has.</p>
<p>It never fails to amaze me how people will believe that fixing a problem that DOES exist is dangerous to a culture.  While living with a handicap is merely continuing the status quo as a good life pattern.</p>
<p>What really happens is such social retranchism spreads as a general paranoia and discourages progress in areas where you are not talking ameliorating a bio impairment difficulty but rather -gaining an advantage-.</p>
<p>And there are those among us who would be quite happy if we were to continue ditch diggering our existence ad infinitum.  Because we were afraid of what kind of society might eventuate if we all had doctoral level IQs as a function of seeing where we are going.</p>
<p>And changing course.</p>

<p>   I&rsquo;m in favor of voluntary procedures as long as the recipient is not receiving government assistance. If someone is receiving taxpayer&rsquo;s money, I feel government is justified in imposing conditions. This is why I support sterilization for welfare mothers with more than two children. Additional welfare payments would be conditional on sterilization. Taxpayers should not be forced to support costly and socially destructive lifestyles. Having children in this instance is a matter of choice not necessity.  </p>

<p>This is all part of the &#8216;empowerment&rsquo; movement (owning your own &#8216;victim&rsquo; status) and it&rsquo;s both selfish and criminal. <br>

<p>&#8220;The Nazi eugenics program was mainly aimed at mental defectives who were instutionalized. It allowed these people to be released and lead normal lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nazi eugenics program was divided into two basic parts:</p>
<p>1) Positive eugenics - which consisted of finding suitable peoples to mate and produce &#8220;fit&#8221; children.  The Nazis termed this &#8220;lebensborn&#8221; (German: &#8220;Fount of Life&#8221;).</p>
<p>2) Negative eugenics - defectives who could function in society were sterilized and released.  More severe cases were invariably euthanized under the Aktion T-4 program.</p>
<p>https://www11.georgetown.edu/research/kie/hsbioethics/units/cases/unit4_5.html</p>
<p>Again, however, this was done under the auspices of a totalitarian government.  Eugenics programs were also in existence in places like America, Sweden, Canada&hellip;even Mexico!</p>

<p>In none of these places was anything done even remotely similar to what was done in Nazi Germany.  The triumphs of Bolshevism and Fabian Socialism after WW2 has done irreparable harm to the West.</p>

<p>This just goes to show that everyone has a cause seemingly but white heterosexual men - and it ends up with white heterosexual men (who are not allowed to speak up least they be &#8216;nazi&rsquo;) being blamed as the cause of everyone else&rsquo;s &#8216;oppression&rsquo;. </p>
<p>This in itself is a repeat of &#8216;Nazism&rsquo;, perhaps. Blaming one group for all the worlds problems, be they individual or international. </p>
