<h1><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128672288">USDA Flap Shows &#8216;Post-Racial&rsquo; Future Has Not Arrived</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alan Greenblatt, National Public Radio, July 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The decision to fire Agriculture Department official Shirley Sherrod  &mdash;  an action Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack has now rescinded  &mdash;  is clearly part of a larger debate about discrimination and racial sensitivity in the public sphere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also evidence that hopes so often expressed during the 2008 presidential campaign that Barack Obama would lead the country into a &#8220;post-racial&#8221; future have thus far gone unrealized. The controversy has brought up complaints about past government discrimination against African-Americans and highlighted a feeling among some whites that the administration is biased against them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Charges of Anti-White Bias</b></p>
<p>But some conservatives see the Sherrod controversy as evidence of a different theme  &mdash;  an administration bias against whites. In recent days, there has been a growing chorus of complaints about a Justice Department decision last year to scale back voter intimidation charges against members of the New Black Panther Party.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor, editor of American Renaissance, describes himself as a &#8220;race realist&#8221; and advocates abolishing immigration and anti-discrimination laws. He says it&rsquo;s clear that Sherrod&rsquo;s comments were taken out of context. Nonetheless, he says they tell an important tale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Practically nobody in America had trouble believing that this black employee of USDA would take this extremely race-based view,&#8221; Taylor says. &#8220;That&rsquo;s the significance of this story. It seemed entirely plausible to most Americans that a black employee would have this view of how she should do her job.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Challenging Race-Based Policies</b></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a fantasy for whites to feel discriminated against by government policy, says George R. LaNoue, a political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who studies civil rights cases. There are lots of government contracting and business programs for which white males need not apply, he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&rsquo;t just a feeling. In terms of government contracts, it&rsquo;s a fact,&#8221; LaNoue says. &#8220;We&rsquo;re talking about lots of money, and billions of dollars at stake.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Whites Adopting Civil Rights Rhetoric</b></p>
<p>Some whites have adopted the rhetoric of the civil rights movement in complaining that they are being discriminated against. That has offended many traditional civil rights activists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Tea Party Tension</b></p>
<p>Steinhorn [Leonard Steinhorn, a communications professor at American University and co-author of a book about racial integration] says that Breitbart&rsquo;s post about Sherrod&rsquo;s comments was &#8220;cynical,&#8221; an attempt to use race to score points within a polarized debate. Breitbart himself has made clear that his target was not Sherrod but the NAACP. Sherrod made her remarks at an NAACP event.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Obama: Not Post-Racial</b></p>
<p>The fact that Biden weighed in on the NAACP-Tea Party dispute points up a source of frustration for the White House. Race is one of the Obama administration&rsquo;s least favorite topics, yet inevitably it keeps coming up.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One thing that everyone seems to agree on, despite the very different prisms through which they view and describe discrimination, is that the United States is still far from its &#8220;post-racial&#8221; future.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to deceive ourselves in America that the race issue has been settled,&#8221; says Gary R. Grant, president of the Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association.</p>
<p>&#8220;This notion that we&rsquo;re all going to hold hands and sing &#8216;Kumbaya,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s pure fantasy,&#8221; says Taylor, the American Renaissance editor. &#8220;Racial loyalties are part of human nature.&#8221;<br>

<p>**********</p>
<p>&#8220;That has offended many traditional civil rights activists&#8221;   &mdash;   Now ain&rsquo;t that too bad.  Imagine we are discriminated against, initiate a weak rhetorical response and THEY&rsquo;RE offended!  We&rsquo;re the victims, complain nowhere near the level we should complain at and THEY&rsquo;RE OFFENDED.  Are &#8220;they&#8221; offended if we eat?  Are &#8220;they&#8221; offended if we breathe too?</p>
<p>And it actually looked like Ms. Sherrod was going to lose her job.  And we thought, &#8220;Oh maybe the double-standard is lessening a bit&#8221;.   Not a chance.  White man to the rescue   &mdash;   of Blacks that is.  Good old Tom Vilsack.  White man makes the most innocuous statement, then he&rsquo;s fired and lambasted by the media, but poor disadvantaged Shirley Sherrod&rsquo; comments were taken out of context.  Oh!  We must right this grievous wrong and give her her job back.  Why, she&rsquo;s due for a promotion too, I&rsquo;d say!  This is just another example of Blacks asserting their new power over Whites.  And if we protest, why, we&rsquo;re racists!</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not just Blacks and the media who are to blame, it&rsquo;s White&rsquo;s like Tom Vilsack who pander the way they do at the feet of Blacks and other groups and are selling us out and have been selling us out for the last 4 decades.</p>

		<p>Well, now that Whites are victims of racism, it&rsquo;s OK to be racist - even apologize for bringing the issue up. We see what stage II is about. They&rsquo;re apparently done with their effort convincing us whites are never victims of racism, and that this grave injustice can only afflict non-whites. That&rsquo;s a long time to control peoples minds. </p>

		<p>My husband listens to news and political talk shows all day, and, though I stay cloistered in my den, I hear something about this woman from his TV almost everytime I pass through the living room!  Yesterday, I went to have my oil changed, and there she was on Headline News.  Regardless of how fairly or unfairly the USDA has treated her (I have no idea myself), I hope the whole affair makes it clear to whites just what we&rsquo;re up against.  </p>

<p>Well, the &#8220;civil rights movement&#8221; adopted the rhetoric of whites, such as the concepts of justice and fair play, when they founded their &#8220;movement,&#8221; so I guess turnabout is fair play.</p>

		<p>The big news this morning was that the Obama Administration has formally apologized to Sherrod. Seems to be a pattern to this, the incessant butting into racially charged matters without sufficient information and subsequent backing off.</p>
<p>All&rsquo;s well that ends well, I guess. Now, are there plans for the mediocre mulatto to apologize to the thousands upon thousands of white Americans whose lives and careers have been ruined because of the perception that  &mdash;  nuance/schmuance  &mdash;  they might have demonstrated at some unguarded moment in their lives evidence of PREEEEEEJ-diss?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

		<p> It&rsquo;s nice that NPR could put aside its usual liberal bias enough to publish a pretty well-balanced column about the issue of race, which is not going to go away, and which has not &#8220;not improved&#8221; during Obama&rsquo;s administration, but which has actually gotten worse.</p>
<p> Jared Taylor is right   &mdash;   racial loyalties are part of human nature. That&rsquo;s why people of two races (not ones with a small admixture of, say, Native American, like myself, but people who are 50-50) often find themselves caught between the two sides, angry, frustrated, and ultimately giving way to hatred and rage. They don&rsquo;t know who they really are.</p>
<p> It&rsquo;s interesting that Leonard Steinhorn talks as if White people who feel they are victims of discrimination are being hypocrites. Surely he&rsquo;s aware that we&rsquo;ve been force fed the notion of White guilt and black victimhood for the past 50-odd years. When we perceive that, no, things are NOT as the government and news media and liberal academics told us, but that, regardless of what ONCE was true in race relations, it&rsquo;s now WE WHITE FOLKS who are getting the shaft, why should we be called &#8220;hypocrites&#8221; for speaking out?</p>
<p> George R. LaNoue is right on target when he says that it&rsquo;s &#8220;not a fantasy&#8221; that we&rsquo;re now the main victims of discrimination.  </p>

<p>Instead, in just 18 months of the Obama administration, racial discord is growing and relations seem to have been set back a generation.  Black voters are galvanizing behind Obama at a time of rapidly falling support. White independents, in contrast, are leaving Obama in droves. </p>
<p>snip</p>
<p>In turn, a number of Americans want to know why  &mdash;  nearly a half-century after the Civil Rights Act, affirmative action, and Great Society programs  &mdash;  some national lobbying organizations still identify themselves by archaic tribal terms such as &ldquo;colored people&rdquo; or &ldquo;La Raza&rdquo; (&ldquo;the race&rdquo;) when it would be taboo for other groups to adopt such racial nomenclature. </p>
<p>snip</p>
<p>The more the president appeals to his base in racial terms, the more his appointees identify themselves as members of a particular tribe, and the more political issues are framed by racial divisions, so all the more such racial obsession creates a backlash among the racially diverse American people. </p>
<p>end snips</p>
<p><br>
But that is where he is wrong. Race Realism isn&rsquo;t a backlash. It was with us long before Obama. It was here in 1619 when the Dutch dumped some black Africans on our shores because everybody knew what would happen if they got loose in the Netherlands. </p>
<p> We&rsquo;ve been fighting to keep our people sane through Race Realism ever since that tragic and woeful day.</p>
<p>Slavery reparations? The Dutch owe us more than they can repay before the Sun burns out.</p>
<p>And &#8220;backlash&#8221; is the wrong word.  Connotes a reversal of progress and a step backwards.  White Awareness is the biggest step forward we can make right now, and millions of our White Brothers and Sisters are making that great stride with us.  We are surging forward toward White Destiny! </p>
<p>When we reach our soon coming Day of Racial Reckoning, we will have to thank whomever told Hillary to flip it to Obama, and Obama himself, and even his White baby moma who let herself get knocked up by  Real African.</p>

		<p>If a White had done what what Sherrod had done he&rsquo;d be toast.<br>
Sherrod was a prime member of a group that has gotten and will<br>
continue to get billions in discrimination settlements from the<br>
USDA.</p>
<p>Who know how many White farmers she screwed over before her<br>
&#8220;awakening&#8221;?</p>
<p>Her case files should be reviewed for anti-White bias, clients<br>
interviewed and awards to those injured. This most certainly<br>

		<p>Once again our Feckless Leader poked his nose into a racial mess that really makes him look foolish.</p>
<p>Seriously, despite all the media coverage, Obama should stay above the fray and not get involved. It is beneath a president to micromanage nonsense like this, or the beer summit, or whatever.</p>
<p>The country is going down the tubes and he is on the phone with a racist government worker who actually has sued the feds for millions and now she has the president groveling to apologize. </p>
<p>Unbelievable. </p>
<p>If you listen to Shirley&rsquo;s babble all the way through it is clear she is an anti-white opportunist - and none too bright. I don&rsquo;t care if she was trying to make a point - the basic premise of her talk was a disgrace to both public service and all white people. </p>
<p>In some ways, Obama is doing AmRen a favor. Every time he gets down in the dirt over some non-presidential racial issue that has no impact on anything he 1) destroys his so-called &#8220;post-racial&#8221; philosophy, 2) ends up appearing to favor the black position regardless of the facts and 3) further inflame whites who now see him for what he is&hellip;an idiot arm of the congressional black caucus and every other race-baiting activist organization with one goal - to transfer wealth from whites to undeserving blacks.</p>
<p>This can only lead to more whites finally fighting back. As I&rsquo;ve said before, the tolerance of whites is quickly running out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure the nation can withstand two more years of this incompetent, agenda-driven, racist-socialist.</p>
<p>Instead of addressing the country about his lies and broken promises on taxes and health care and jobs all we get is a call to Shirley. </p>
<p>I doubt Obama would have called if the situation was reversed and Shirley was white.<br>

		<p>I know I cannot be alone in saying this is wonderful! I am simply loving all this intense focus, and increasingly heated discussion on race. Sure, 98% of the talk is the same old liberal twaddle from the media, the officials, etc. But one gets the distinct impression that THE PEOPLE, that is to say white people, are not so easily silenced these days. People are realizing that their displacement is well underway, their social and political relevance and power is fading, and their(and their children&rsquo;s)futures are looking rather dim! Fear is a powerful motivator - and white people are scared. This is exactly what we need!</p>
<p>My God, maybe there is a little hope yet!</p>

<p>Darwin Holly, a former employee of TAMKO Building Products in southern Missouri, swears he&rsquo;s &#8220;not a racist&#8221; over comments he made back in May 2009. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when Holly grabbed a slice of watermelon at a company picnic and parked himself near a few other employees. &#8220;I&rsquo;m going to sit down and eat my &#8216;Obama fruit,&rsquo;&#8221; Holly informed his shocked co-workers. </p>
<p>A little over a week later Holly was fired on grounds that he violated the company&rsquo;s racial harassment policy. </p>
<p>Holly appealed his termination to the state&rsquo;s Labor and Industrial Relations Commission, which agreed that he violated TAMKO&rsquo;s harassment policy that prohibits employees from &#8220;making racially derogatory jokes, comments or displaying or possessing racially derogatory or offensive symbols, emblems, writings or other documents on TAMKO property or while conducting TAMKO business.&#8221; </p>
<p>So Holly appealed again, this time to the Missouri Court of Appeals (Southern Division). Last week the court handed down its ruling, agreeing with the commission that Holly had indeed been fired for cause. <br>

<p>I can envision when there will be allowed only a certain yearly  quota of white babies. If that quota is filled (as it will be) you can be inseminated with a non-white baby (of the government&rsquo;s choosing); but if you still want a white baby  you will have to get on the 15-year waiting list. Your name will probably also be put on a list of suspicious persons, and don&rsquo;t be surprised if you lose your job or encounter other strange difficulties.</p>

		<p> Whites, blacks and hispanics are so different from each other that they will never live together peacefully. There&rsquo;s just too much difference. There will always be racism everywhere you go. It&rsquo;s just a fact of life that racism is a defense mechanism ingrained in people to protect  their own kind.

		<p>There is another story within this story.  It took me a while to realize it, and it is being missed by all the perveyors and apologists.  During the tapes, particularly when Sherrod is telling her story about the white farmer, she set up the story in a very revealing fashion, and got amen&rsquo;s from the NAACP congregation.  She described the white farmer as &#8220;speaking in a way to demonstrate his superiority.  I knew what he was trying to do.&#8221;  What was really going on there?  Likely, it was a black woman, of poor education, from a black community that did not respect eduation, assessing a white man as racist because he could speak better English.  She made education a racial seperating point.  And as the tapes showed, when she said that she knew what he was trying to do, the congregation laughed along with her at the tricksey white man, who they were congratulating themselves for knowing &#8220;that old whiteman&rsquo;s trick.&#8221;</p>
<p>I call the NAACP meeting audience a &#8220;congregation&#8221; because they behave in that video just like a black protestant church congregation.  This also adds to the description of the NAACP as a sort of religion, rather than a political entity.  It is a great case as an example of how religion and politics can mix and produce a self-righteous consensus.  Of course, this is what MLK did (with some communism thrown in.  At least that proves that religion and communism are not mutually exclusive).  </p>
<p>But the overall point being missed by even Rush Limbaugh is the racism and set of operating anti-white assumptions that Sherrod not only demonstrates in present time in her description of the white man (she hasn&rsquo;t renegged on that part of her comments (renegged used for effect), but she brings along an enthusiastic present day audience laughing at the antics of the white man and his supposed attempts at demonstrations of his superiority.  This is the story being missed.  Sherrod may have been making a point about the Marxist class struggle in the U.S., but as she did that, she revealed in her delivery that NAACP anti-white racism is very much alive and well.</p>
<p>A great opportunity for a real analysis of the event has been missed because of knee-jerk reactionism on both sides, while they over correct in order to appear virtuous - Bill O&rsquo;Rielly too.</p>
