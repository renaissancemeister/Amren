			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Huma Khan, ABC News, July 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>First Lady Michelle Obama brought renewed energy to the NAACP today, delivering the keynote speech at the annual convention one day before the nation&rsquo;s largest civil rights group is expected to condemn what it calls racist elements in the Tea Party movement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In her speech, the first lady focused on the issue of childhood obesity and her &#8220;Let&rsquo;s Move&#8221; initiative, but outside of her remarks, anti-Tea Party activism has been a key focus of the gathering, which conservative leaders say is driven solely by a political agenda.</p>
<p>Tea Party members have used &#8220;racial epithets,&#8221; have verbally abused black members of Congress and threatened them, and protestors have engaged in &#8220;explicitly racist behavior&#8221; and &#8220;displayed signs and posters intended to degrade people of color generally and President Barack Obama specifically,&#8221; according to the proposed resolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re deeply concerned about elements that are trying to move the country back, trying to reverse progress that we&rsquo;ve made,&#8221; NAACP spokeswoman Leila McDowell told ABC News. &#8220;We are asking that the law-abiding members of the Tea Party repudiate those racist elements, that they recognize the historic and present racist elements that are within the Tea Party movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, in coordination with 170 other groups, including labor unions, is planning a protest march in Washington, D.C., Oct. 10 as the next step in building momentum against the Tea Party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We see it as a threat to democracy. We see it as a threat to human rights. We certainly see it as a threat to civil rights,&#8221; McDowell said, adding that the resolution will likely pass when it&rsquo;s voted upon Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Rev. C.L. Bryant, a former president of NAACP&rsquo;s Garland, Texas, chapter who is now a leading Tea Party activist said the idea that the Tea Party is racist or is trying to instigate a racist climate is &#8220;simply a lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen posters .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. where every president from Reagan to Obama has been called a fascist,&#8221; Bryant, who serves as a contributor to FreedomWorks, which organizes Tea Party groups, told ABC News. &#8220;Why is it that just because we have a black president, we are hyper-sensitive to posters at rallies?&#8221;</p>
<p>The NAACP wants to &#8220;create a climate where they can say that those on the right are in fact racist and those on the left are their saviors,&#8221; he added. &#8220;This is very much what the liberal agenda is about.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>NAACP Takes on Tea Party Movement</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Twenty-seven percent of Americans support the Tea Party, according to a May ABC News/Washington Post poll, but nearly as many Americans oppose the movement as those who support it.</p>
<p>Among registered voters, 15 percent said they would be more likely to support a candidate for Congress who&rsquo;s associated with the Tea Party movement, but 24 percent say they&rsquo;d be more apt to oppose such a candidate.</p>
<p>The poll also found that 57 percent of people who opposed the Tea Party suspected its members of racial prejudice specifically against Obama. Only 10 percent of Tea Party supporters expressed such a sentiment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>NAACP leaders have individually taken on the Tea Party in the past, but the organization is now trying to build a bigger momentum against the Tea Party, which has emerged as a strong grassroots, albeit fragmented, force across the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to close the enthusiasm gap,&#8221; NAACP president Ben Jealous said in an interview with the Associated Press Friday. &#8220;The danger of the Tea Party is that people see them and think about periods in history when groups like them were much more powerful than they are now, and so a lot of what we spend energy doing is explaining to people what reality is, and that the reality is that the majority from 2008 still exists.&#8221;<br>

		<p>If only the Tea Party were a racialist movement.  The NAACP&rsquo;s greatest fear is whites coming to their senses and cutting off the gravey train.  Or better yet demanding a divorce from black America.  The last thing blacks want is to loose access to white people&rsquo;s stuff.</p>

		<p>The time is fast approaching when those who support white people (the &#8220;Tea Party&#8221;) will separate themselves from those who support Obama&hellip;..geographically, culturally, legally, and most importantly, financially.</p>
<p>It is going to be of extreme importance, which side of the fence the state you live in, is.</p>
<p>In the beginning, non-whites will support this&hellip;.one of the biggest issues for them, during the Bush years (conveniently not covered in the media) was seccession.  But quickly, they will come to understand that this means no more welfare.</p>
<p>By the time they figure it out, they won&rsquo;t be able to do anything about it&hellip;..except make demands on equally powerless white race traiters.</p>
<p>All of this is thanks to one Barak Abdullah (slave of Islam) Hussein Obama.  The greatest force for white racial awakening in the history of the world.</p>

<p>As an aside, one of the purported reasons for her anti-obesity kick is because a lot of kids are too fat as teenagers to join the military.  That ought to make the Democrat left&rsquo;s political base really happy to hear, that her anti-war in the campaign husband has a wife whose only concern about obesity is &#8220;military readiness.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re deeply concerned about elements that are trying to move the country back, trying to reverse progress that we&rsquo;ve made,&rdquo; NAACP spokeswoman Leila McDowell told ABC News. &ldquo;We are asking that the law-abiding members of the Tea Party repudiate those racist elements, that they recognize the historic and present racist elements that are within the Tea Party movement.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Pay attention to the arrogant semantics here.  She is implying that white racism is a crime.  Which would be news to me if it was.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;We have to close the enthusiasm gap,&rdquo; NAACP president Ben Jealous said in an interview with the Associated Press Friday.</i></p>
<p>This happens with every change in the political party that runs the White House.  When a Republican is the President, even lame ones like Bush and Bush, the left gets its dander up.  When a Democrat is in charge, the right has to rally the troops around the Indians that are coming over the walls.  The TPM exists b/c a Democrat is President.  The NAACP is bumming because the President is a Democrat (and black).  That&rsquo;s all there is to it.</p>

		<p>Establishment politicians of all stripes seem apprehensive it not openly hostile towards the tea party people. It seemed puzzling to me as most of their rhetoric is rather mild and dwells on things like taxes, etc. I think what worries the politicians is that apparently a large portion of the public is disaffected and is looking for a new home, a new party. People are sick of the hand in hand fraud of both of the establishment parties. Look for them to do things like: preempting the tea party by parroting their themes but then of course not following through; setting up phony rival tea parties to weaken the movement by fomenting factionalism and confusing voters; having people like Palin jump in front of the parade and claim to be leading it; various dirty tricks; MSM smear campaigns, including these pearls of wisdom from the president&rsquo;s wife. I don&rsquo;t know if the Tea Party is it but I for one would like to wash my hands of the current established Republocrat parties. All I want is a choice.         </p>

		<p>When the NAACP repudiates the black racists and black nationalists in their own organization&hellip;..then and only then&hellip;..can they demand (or suggest) that racists be removed from any other organization.</p>
<p>And what is to become of all the racists when they are purged from the NAACP and the Tea Party? Are they to start their own organizations that are clearly racist?<br>

		<p>This is just part of the &#8220;transforming America&#8221; strategy.</p>
<p>Any majority White political movement will be condemned as Racist.   This is why the republicans will probably run a hispanic for pres. in 2012.  Can&rsquo;t affort the racist label if run a Whitey.  </p>
<p>The non whites and their secret handlers whose loyalites fall far from America must always squelch any expression of White Unity.</p>
<p><br>
Read Codreanu&rsquo;s For My Legionaires.</p>
<p>Whites must never feel a part of a majority White group our White cause. They must be made to feel shameful and racist and hateful if they ever organize to complain about how more miserable their lives have  suddenly become during Obamakenyatta&rsquo;s racial regime.</p>
<p>I predict victory for Michelle and the NAACP thugs.  Just look at our dismal White history at fighting for our own interests. Where do you see that we ever stuck with it and kept fighting?</p>
<p>The collapse of Massive Resistance was the harbinger of all things racial to come. That racial surrender sent a stronger message to our enemies than we have ever publically admitted. </p>
<p>Whites are quitters. They deserve the misery they get, and may it please get worse and worse just to teach them a good lesson about handing their White created democracy and republic over to their &#8220;equal&#8221; non white citizenry.</p>
<p>One day soon, we won&rsquo;t have this forum for posting.  Save this page to your hard drive so you pull it up and can hear my voice in your ears saying &#8220;told ya so!&#8221;</p>
<p>And today Glenn Beck continued confusing everybody about Race.  He did a good job of pointing out what we Amrenners want to be discussed out in the open, but he eventually started worshipping Michael King Reverand.</p>
<p>As long as Beck keeps his White audience aware that militant blacks openly call for the killing of White babies, then we&rsquo;ll forgive him the MLK nonsense.  Did any of us ever think that a major news host would be alerting our White Humanity to the dangers of living in a society with large numbers of the blacks?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see Beck banned from public consumption. If he&rsquo;s not jailed for inciting violence, he&rsquo;ll be relegated to some web chanel like Infowars and have his audience cut down to just a handful of thousands.  He&rsquo;ll go from making 40 million per year to about 40 thousand.  But he&rsquo;ll be ok, bc he&rsquo;s smart enough to have banked plenty.</p>
<p>But his audience will just be a bunch of racists, so he&rsquo;ll become irrelevant and be held up in contempt as an example of what will happen to anyone who dares challenge the transformers of formerly White America into very strong third world thugocracy.</p>

<p>Andrew Breitbart is offering $100,000 for video or photo proof of any of this. Why haven&rsquo;t we seen it, if it really has happened?</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re deeply concerned about elements that are trying to move the country back, trying to reverse progress that we&rsquo;ve made,&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is, &#8220;we&rsquo;re afraid of the giant Something For Nothing Express coming to a halt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We see it as a threat to democracy&hellip; .&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, white citizens voicing their opinions all out in the open and everything is certainly a &#8220;threat to democracy.&#8221; Democracy is ebonics for &#8220;getting what we blacks want and suppressing complaints from the whites who pay for it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>How utterly laughable!</p>
<p>The one thing that this demonstrates about the NAACP and the Marxstream Media in general, is that if the &ldquo;racist&rdquo; right ever really got its act together and gained momentum, they would be doomed. The Tea Party is hardly what I would consider racially aware, let alone &ldquo;racist;&rdquo; it seems to be first and foremost anti-tax and secondarily anti-Socialist. While it does have an anti-&ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; bent, that is as close as the movement comes to demographic considerations at all.</p>
<p><br>
Indeed, when you find that: </p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;57 percent of people who opposed the Tea Party suspected its members of racial prejudice specifically against Obama. Only 10 percent of Tea Party supporters expressed such a sentiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You know that we are at a level of distrust and animosity in this country, that has not been seen since the 1960s. Worse still, at least in the 1960s, we were a much more homogeneous and anti-Communist country. Now, well, &ldquo;Diversity is our Strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Our &#8220;collective salvation&#8221; will come to  us when White Americans universally admits that White Republicans have done more damage to us than anyone else.    </p>
<p>Sumner, Lincoln, Stevens, Wade, Sherman, Grant, Reagan, Bush, and Bush.</p>
<p><br>
George W. Bush, the White Republican President, said this about Katrina, and still the blacks voted 95% for their black Obama:</p>
<p>&#8220;As all of us saw on television, there is also some deep, persistent poverty in this region as well. And that poverty has roots in a history of racial discrimination, which cut off generations from the opportunity of America. We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Never trust a White Republican on race issues- they always side with our enemies, and prove themselves always to be race traitors.</p>
<p>If you are a member of White Humanity and love your race, you have nothing but enemies.  To have friends, you must always put the interests of non whites ahead of your own, but even that won&rsquo;t prevent your beautiful, young White daughter from getting robbed, raped, and murdered by the Diversity.</p>
<p>In other words, submissively watching your White family be made miserable and exterminated is the only way you can be left alone by White Liberal Elites and their pets.</p>
<p>In other words, we are losing this war.  The free and open Internet won&rsquo;t last. Better get to know your neighbors and look for hidden clues that they too might be Race Realists.</p>
<p>Read Steele&rsquo;s Defensive Racism.  Discuss Mel Gibson and look for those who aren&rsquo;t offended by his telling the truth.</p>
<p>So he warns his ex girlfriend about the dangers of dressing provocatively in a multicultural society, and he loses his career?  Why won&rsquo;t the MSM come out and say she can dress as skimpy as she wants, walk down MLK Blvd., and she will never be hurt?  That&rsquo;s the only refutation of Mel Gibson that counts, not just damning him from the n word.  Some of your neighbors may know he was speaking the truth and will agree if given the chance in a safe environment.    </p>
<p>Seek and Support White Humanity.  Seek Race Realists and befriend them.  </p>
<p><br>
And always transcend multiracial diversity, just like the White Nurse who said &#8220;I wasn&rsquo;t a racist until I started working here.&#8221;<br>

		<p> This article was a rare bird indeed: A news report from the mainstream media that actually gives balanced coverage of the Left&rsquo;s ridiculous allegations of &#8220;racism&#8221; on the part of Tea Party members. Of course the NAACP is going to yell &#8220;Racism!&#8221; at any conservative organization which obviously has the support of millions of people. Wake the NAACP up from a sound sleep and it would yell &#8220;Racism!&#8221; and &#8220;Bigotry!&#8221; as a reflex action.</p>
<p>  I did think, though, that the writer indulged in a little genuflecting to the liberal side when he (she? can&rsquo;t tell which) referred to the Tea Party&rsquo;s being supported by &#8220;the likes of&#8221; Rand Paul and Sarah Palin. Smacks a little of the left wing&rsquo;s &#8220;right-wing varmint&#8221; playbook. </p>

		<p>Ha!  Serves &#8216;em right.  No matter how much the Tea Parties  (and various &#8220;conservative&#8221; groups) deplore &#8220;racism&#8221; and try to distance themselves from it,  that still doesn&rsquo;t work.  They&rsquo;re going to get accused of it anyway, no matter what.  They might as well just face it and accept it.</p>

Boiled down to it&rsquo;s nub - Obama and the NAACP see the tea party as a threat only because it cancels out the monolithic black vote for all things black - welfare, Obama, tax payers paying for loans to credit unworthy blacks, etc.  If you have the blacks voting en masse, and then an organization comes along that can accumulate enough followers to negate the black vote and the liberal vote, then it&rsquo;s left to the independents to set policy in this country NOT BLACKS AND LIBERALS.  That, of course, would disrupt the entire black program of handouts and privileges.  By the way, the charges of racism and threats to black caucus congresscritters was proven a complete lie.  And the people trying to attend Tea Party events with racist signs were discovered to be SEIU UNION stooges and ejected.  But we all know that.  The pity is, so many whites do NOT.</p>

Exactly what are the &#8220;racist elements in the Tea Party movement&#8221;? Simply that there are too many middle class whites concerned about being over taxed?</p>
<p>The Tea (Taxed Enough Already) Party is about protesting excessive taxes on the middle class. It&rsquo;s not about race. The only reason race appears to be an issue is because whites are over taxed and blacks believe whites are&rsquo;t taxed enough.</p>

		<p>After eight years of Bush, I&rsquo;d have voted for a ham sandwich for president before I&rsquo;d have voted Republican. Actually, I think Obama&rsquo;s trying to deal with some virtually unsolvable problems in as rational a way as possible. My problem has always been with his wife and the company he keeps, especially that white guy wannabe Eric Holder. Though they were able to muzzle here pretty successfully during the campaign, Ms. Obama reminds me for all the world of the typical sour-faced affirmative action hire with permanent chip on shoulder.</p>
<p>I think #2 hit the nail on the head: Blacks are pants-soiling scared of whites coming to a consensus and stopping the free ride once and for all. It&rsquo;s going to have to happen if this nation is to survive intact, and it ain&rsquo;t gonna be pretty. Obama is smart enough to know this as well, and isn&rsquo;t sure how to handle it or even whether it can be handled within the system as we currently know it. It seems his strategy is to keep the lid on things and not a whole lot more. Just my opinion.</p>

		<p>To The Hon. Roger Taney at post #8 (7:06 PM, July 12):</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll see Glenn Beck banned from public consumption or jailed for inciting violence; he&rsquo;s keeping his white butt covered with MLK tributes and myths about black Founders.  This keeps Fox News true to its commitment to diversity (an agreement it has recently entered into with a panel of black authorities on black advocacy), and gives Beck the leeway to point out certain truths about black stereotypes as long as he limits his criticisms to black individuals or organizations and states that his intention is to promote a mutually respectful racial co-existence; a delusional pipedream from which he sometimes almost seems to emerge into semi-consciousness.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s scheduled to make an &#8220;I have a dream&#8221; speech at the Lincoln memorial in D.C. later this year.  Don&rsquo;t expect much controversy; he doesn&rsquo;t even dare to apply King&rsquo;s comment about the &#8220;content of one&rsquo;s character&#8221; to the Most Exalted Reverend Doctor himself.</p>
<p>I expect he&rsquo;ll wallow in deference to blacks in spite of the heckling he&rsquo;s sure to receive from them.  But as long as he continues to &#8220;humor&#8221; them, he can avail himself of fleeting opportunities to expose some of their racial arrogance and hypocrisy.  For the time being, his is the best voice we have in the public &#8220;conversation about race.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s decidedly compromised, but it gives the Tea Partiers a leg to stand on, and like &#8216;em or not, the Tea Parties are the closest thing to organized resistance to government excesses we&rsquo;ve seen in a generation.  </p>

Ha! Serves &lsquo;em right. No matter how much the Tea Parties (and various &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; groups) deplore &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and try to distance themselves from it, that still doesn&rsquo;t work. They&rsquo;re going to get accused of it anyway, no matter what. They might as well just face it and accept it.</p>

I just cant wait until the White obama slobberers are called (RACIST!!!) by their chosen masters. I cannot wait until the time comes when their chosen masters are targeting them as their enemy. It wouldnt matter to them anyway. They would do as they have been doing all of their lives&hellip;crouching down and licking the hands of their masters. The ones that make them feel whole. The ones that have been bamboozled into believing they are put on this earth to do one thing, and that is to raise blacks above anyone else. Even above themselves, which is utterly sickening.</p>
<p>The day is going to come to when these blacks are going to turn, like rabid dogs on the same very people that worship them.</p>

<p>That is true.  But what the marxist left is demonstrating here is a time-(dis)honored tactic.  They accuse the Tea Party of &#8220;racism,&#8221; and demand that they &#8220;repudiate their racist elements.&#8221;  Since the Tea Party (sadly) doesn&rsquo;t <i>have</i> any, they are faced with three choices:</p>
<p>1: Bluster and splutter about how horrible Racism is, while falling all over themselves to denounce &#8220;Hate.&#8221;  This will make them appear to their members to be weak sellouts, which would be true.</p>
<p>2: Protest that they aren&rsquo;t Racists at all, which the left and their governmedia stooges will exploit as &#8220;proof&#8221; of their sinister refusal to purify themselves.</p>
<p>3: Find a few members who can be burned as witches after being charged with &#8220;Racism,&#8221; then loudly throw them out of the party.  The marxists, of course, will claim it&rsquo;s only the tip of the iceberg, and the governmedia, as usual, will back them up all the way.</p>
<p>And, I suppose, a fourth option would be &#8220;All of the above.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even a cursory reading of the article will demonstrate to what extent the controlled governmedia is in the pocket of &#8220;our&#8221; banana-republic administration.  And they will continue to be its cheerleaders as long as they are permitted to do so.<br>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Tea Party members have used &#8216;racial epithets,&rsquo; have verbally abused black members of Congress and threatened them&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>No government-controlled government journalist dare &#8216;call out&rsquo; the first lady, as she is black and untouchable.  And, as Cassiodorus writes, Andrew Breitbart has offered a $ 100,000 reward for anyone can present proof that black members of congress were spat upon or called the n-word.</p>
<p>Breitbart stated recently that it&rsquo;s been four months and the money is burning a hole in his pocket.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s upped the ante.  He&rsquo;s also offered to donate $10,000 to the United Negro College Fund.</p>
<p>These new attacks on the Tea Party  &mdash;  calling them dangerous racists that &#8216;must be stopped&rsquo;  &mdash;   are part of the government&rsquo;s plan to pass Hate Speech laws  &mdash;  and soon. </p>
<p> From the ADL:</p>
<p> The ADL has publically called for Tea Party demonstrators be prosecuted for politically incorrect speech, under hate crime laws, for &#8216;slurs&rsquo;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Our leaders should demand criminal prosecution for those who cross the line. Acts like throwing bricks through the windows of Congressional offices, spitting on African-American elected officials, slinging of same racial slurs en rout to the Capitol&hellip; are not constitutionally protected, and require a strong legal response&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I expect there will be a huge upswing in racial slurs &#8216;slung&rsquo;  from Tea Partiers and other racial attacks coming from that organization  &mdash;  from a carefully planted fifth column within the tea party ranks, false flag-type acts &#8216;caught on tape&rsquo; blasted by CNN, denounced by the CBC and blamed on the &#8216;racist&rsquo; tea party, giving the government an excuse for more anti-Free Speech legislation.  Similar to how we got into the Viet Nam War.</p>
<p>Count on it, and soon.  There&rsquo;s an election coming up.</p>

		<p>Endangered By White Republicans has made some very compelling points, most worthy of consideration.</p>
<p>Regarding my hero Mel Gibson, he was obviously very frustrated in attempting to drill some sense into his EX(?) girlfriend, and totally spoke the truth about exactly what would happen if a white girl (even one maybe not so pretty as Mel&rsquo;s) would walk down a street in a black neighborhood provocatively dressed. Actually, it happens in white neighborhoods by black rapists all the time, so the girl doesn&rsquo;t even have to leave home!</p>
<p>Nothing new here, crime statistics back up what I just said.</p>
<p>If the moves the Obama administration is making on all fronts to force a collapse of our country (so he can rebuild it as he sees fit), does not wake up our still-in-majority white people, nothing will. However, every day I see signs of people coming to their senses, having had their fill of seeing their country slip away, here and there. </p>

		<p>Remember Folks, this is not a very complicated issue. What Michelle Obama means by racist is this: any Native Born White American who opposes being race-replaced by high fertility post-1965 nonwhites. </p>
<p>Now the Tea Partiers have not publicly expressed opposition to post-1965 race-replacement immigration policy. What Michell Obama is doing is waging a racial war of preemption against the Tea Partiers.</p>
<p>Michelle Obama and the Democratic Party in general-its post-1965 nonwhite voting block-are waging a vicious race war against the majority Native Born White American Majority. These new comments by Michelle Obama are an escalation in the vicious race war against the Native Born White Majority.</p>
<p>It is absolutely crucial that when Jared Taylor appears on the MSM that he immediately deconstructs the Democratic party&rsquo;s meaning of the term &#8220;racist&#8221;. Immediately after doing this, start speaking to his fellow Native Born White Americans about post-1965 race-replacement immigration policy and accuse its enthusiastic supporters of being vicious racist. There is no other way to fight against race-replacement. The anemic logic chopping beating-around-the bush approach won&rsquo;t get the job done.</p>
<p>Keep it simple and direct. It is the most effective approach.</p>
<p>The Republican Party is not worth saving, for it has completely conceded the race-replacement issue to the nonwhite Democratic party voting block. </p>

<p>Until a few months ago, I would have agreed with you in your Obama denial.  But at some point, I had to (and you&rsquo;ll have to) overcome the denial stage, and realize that Obama isn&rsquo;t hanging around all these extremist wackos out of pure accident, or because they&rsquo;re fooling him.  (Why doesn&rsquo;t he fire them?  Why isn&rsquo;t a right winger giving him the slip every once in awhile, per the law of averages?)</p>
<p>Let it sink in:  Barack Obama IS an extremist wacko.</p>
<p>Am I supposed to be impressed that he has two adorable daughters and loves them?  As if he&rsquo;s the only person in this world who has two adorable daughters and loves them.  Am I supposed to be impressed that he&rsquo;s not Bush?  Al Sharpton isn&rsquo;t Bush either.  Gonna vote for him?  And far from &#8220;keeping a lid on things,&#8221; he&rsquo;s helping to blow the lid off things (which, in the opinion of some here, isn&rsquo;t such a bad thing.)  Probably deliberately, because Rahm believes in not letting a crisis &#8220;go to waste,&#8221; i.e. go without a response of an even bigger and more leftist and anti-white government.</p>
<p>For the record, the last fiscal year Federal budget under a Republican President, Republican House and Republican Senate was FY 2006 (10/1/2005 to 9/30/2006), and &#8220;only&#8221; $161 billion of red ink was run up that FY.  By comparison, June 30, 2010 ran up the debt $166 billion by itself.  Of course, that&rsquo;s not an entirely fair statistic, because the GOP-passed Medicare drug benefit hadn&rsquo;t fully taken hold in that FY, the first of the boomers started in on Social Security in 2008, they&rsquo;ll start in on Medicare in 2011, and ObamaCare is right around the corner.  As much as a $161 billion deficit seemed like Halcyon Days compared to today, today&rsquo;s $1.4 trillion deficit is going to be small in five years.</p>

They probably don&rsquo;t realize that continuing to label opposition to their views only wakes up more whites to the fact that people are tired of paying for the gravy train, as other posters have noted.  Additionally, their response only reinforces the fact that unfortunately, due to deficits in intelligence and education, trying to have a lively political discourse with the majority of blacks is like talking to pigeons&hellip;..The results are about the same.</p>

It was really frustrating listening to GOP hacks talk about immigration being just fine as long as it&rsquo;s legal and that we&rsquo;re a nation of immigrants. I look around and everyone&rsquo;s wide eyed and smiling like the good lemmings they are.  They got to the part about fighting the &#8220;War on Terror&#8221; in Iraq and Afghanistan and I just lost it.  I couldn&rsquo;t deal with the frustration anymore and decided to instigate something by shouting some rather Mel Gibsonish language at the speaker.

		<p>Lies and politics were bad enough when the situation involved mostly whites, because lying and underhanded tactics has always been at overload levels throughout the history of this country.</p>
<p>But with the injection of blacks into the equation, it has reached a new low, as everything does when blacks get involved.</p>
<p>That an entire group of people are lying about racial slurs being hurled during the tea party protest, namely the NAACP, then expanding on it as if the charges haven&rsquo;t proved false is how the black mind works.  </p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s just their inept way of trying their hand at psychological warfare, especially by having this Michelle saying the same thing, and it isn&rsquo;t going to work except with mentally deficient blacks and a few whites.  But it&rsquo;s an excellent illustration of their lying clumsiness, just as the claims of the Roman Senate being one third black, and the Egyptians black.  Even when they lie, what they claim is so full of foolishness it sounds as if it came from the 7th grade.</p>
<p>This Michelle has a lot of nerve complaining about inequality when she was &#8220;awarded&#8221; an AA degree, given a large paying position, yet her knowledge, intellect and sophistication is strictly high school, if we want to be generous.</p>
<p>This is what whites get when they pretend these people are advancing and earning on their own.  They&rsquo;re so arrogant, they believe blacks don&rsquo;t get ahead because of white oppression instead of the real reason which is a lack of ability and intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really disgusting. </p>

The accusations of racism are absurd.</p>
<p><br>
No they&rsquo;re not, and they shouldn&rsquo;t be.  We want and need the Tea Party to be racist.   Racism built this country, and anti racism is destorying it. </p>
<p>Our day of salvation will come when Whites organized politically and declare outright that non whites are destroying the republic as enabled by White Liberal Elites.</p>
<p>We need more openly admitted Racism, because in the Tea Party Context, Racism means Liberty.</p>
<p>We need to find a way to reflect racism back on the NAACP, which should be very easy.  It&rsquo;s starting.<br>

		<p>Well, these black geniuses have shot themselves in the foot again.  They can&rsquo;t even lie about their white opposition and succeed.  </p>
<p>But, what they have succeeded in doing is drawing more attention to their lack of scurples and their whining attempts to carry on a lie that was disproven nationally at least a half dozen times.  Though I&rsquo;m pretty sure they secured the belief of their black minions and white kool aid drinkers, who are too ignorant to know the difference, they had those people&rsquo;s dumb loyalty all along anyway, and they only amount to just few percent of the population.</p>
<p>The unintended consequences of their stupidity is that very right leaning talk show host in the country is airing the subject and revealing what a pack of lies it all is.  But, more than that, the mentally challenged NAACP has opened the door to revealing the process by which they tell a lie, then expand on it, hoping to foster belief by repeating it over and over again.  Blacks really DO need someone else to tell them what to say and whine about, because, like everything else, they botch it all up too badly and whatever they try to lie about winds up causing them to be further discredited than ever.</p>
<p>Too, has anybody else noticed what I&rsquo;ve noticed for the last several months, especially the last few weeks?  The community organizer and his advocates have brought up the racism whine so often it is giving natonal radio and television talk show hosts an excuse to enter race into the equation, where, before, they would have been hammered for mentioning it.</p>
<p>The result is that racist talk and actions by blacks are being discussed more than it ever could have been if blacks in general had kept their mouths shut. </p>
<p>The community organizer and the racists connected to him are revealing to couch potato whites that blacks are FAR more racist than any other group in the US, and it&rsquo;s opening the curtain further and further, allowing us to not only talk about it more, but to give the subject the condemnation it needs. </p>
<p>With the climate that is being inadvertently created, the next time blacks demonstrate over an alleged black on white rape, we will now be free to reveal to the entire nation that blacks rape an average of 37,500 white women every year, and not a word is said about it.  If the Duke rape case had occurred now, it might have received a far different initial response than what it got.</p>
<p>But, I&rsquo;m all for letting them continue their cry baby whining, because it&rsquo;s back firing on them, and it&rsquo;s awakening more whites to the seriousness of the black situation.  </p>

		<p>(NAACP) &#8216;concerned about elements trying to move the country back, trying to reverse progress that we&rsquo;ve made&hellip;..&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes, the Tea Party &#8216;elements&rsquo; ARE trying to move the country back&hellip;they are trying to reverse the &#8216;progress&rsquo; that &#8216;we&rsquo;ve&rsquo; made.</p>
<p>That is, what we Tea Partiers will accomplish:  a return to the days of minimal government, (=more freedom) and fewer taxes (=right to enjoy fruits of my labor, vs. giving away my hard-earned dollars to the extortionists so they can &#8216;spread around the wealth&rsquo;.</p>
