			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David A. Graham, Reader Supported News, July 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As voter-intimidation exercises go, it wasn&rsquo;t much. In 2008, a lone white voter reported he had encountered two black men dressed all in black, one carrying a nightstick, at his Philadelphia polling place in a predominantly black neighborhood. The armed man was escorted away by police, and no one reported the incident to the local district attorney. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So how did the incident become a replay of the ACORN scandal? There&rsquo;s some resemblance between the two: an organization with unacceptable practices and a vague connection to the Obama administration (through voter registration drives in the ACORN case and Justice Department litigation in the Panther case) becomes a tool for critics of the White House to attack it as corrupt and illegitimate. But as in the ACORN case, the scandal is minimal (much of the ACORN hit has been discredited)  &mdash;  and the allegations against Obama flimsy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The group [the New Black Panther Party] typically gets attention every few years when it successfully manages to bait the national media with some nutty stand. In 2006, for example, the NBPP announced it was going to Durham, N.C., to investigate the Duke lacrosse case. Fox News, in particular, loves it: after the Duke charges were dropped in 2007, Bill O&rsquo;Reilly had Shabazz on the program, where he called syndicated conservative columnist Michelle Malkin a &#8220;whore.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The Washington Times  &mdash;  began digging into the [voter-intimidation] case, suggesting that because a top Obama appointee had signed off on the decision to drop charges, a move allegedly opposed by career lawyers, it provided proof that Holder&rsquo;s Justice Department was a bastion of political favoritism (and, by implication, racism, given that both Holder and Obama are black).</p>
<p>Although that story didn&rsquo;t go mainstream, it did cause the Commission on Civil Rights, an independent body, to take up the case. As Dave Weigel reported, there was more to that decision than met the eye: after eight years of George W. Bush appointments, the commission tilted definitively right. In addition, the star witness in the case against the NBPP, Bartle Bull, wasn&rsquo;t exactly impartial. The white former Robert F. Kennedy aide, who called the incident &#8220;the most blatant form of voter intimidation I have encountered in my political campaigns in many states, even going back to the work I did in Mississippi in the 1960s,&#8221; had been an outspoken critic of Obama for some time.</p>
<p>The commission has met several times to examine the case, but things really blew open on July 6, when Bush Justice official J. Christian Adams, who is white, suggested that Justice&rsquo;s voting division avoided bringing cases where defendants were black and plaintiffs were white. Adams&rsquo;s testimony is questionable; there are doubts about whether he was actually present for the incidents he described, and he&rsquo;s refused to offer details on key questions. Critics see other credibility problems for Adams: he was, for instance, hired when Bush&rsquo;s Justice Department was systematically weakening the civil-rights division by forcing out career lawyers and replacing them with attorneys who had strong conservative credentials but little in the way of civil-rights experience.</p>
<p>This week&rsquo;s resolution by the NAACP blasting &#8220;racism&#8221; in the Tea Party has further fanned the flame. At its 101st annual convention in St. Louis, the nation&rsquo;s oldest civil-rights organization condemned the party&rsquo;s &#8220;continued tolerance for bigotry.&#8221; Tea Party leaders heatedly rejected the criticism, and Palin dismissed it as &#8220;a diversionary tactic.&#8221; To some commentators on the right, the NAACP action is rank hypocrisy, given that the group hasn&rsquo;t condemned the racism they see festering over at Justice.</p>
<p>{snip} While there&rsquo;s little doubt that the NBPP is a fringe group, critics of the decision to drop the suit have a tough case to make. The problem is that although it may look like voter intimidation, there aren&rsquo;t actually any voters who filed an official complaint claiming to have been intimidated. As Adam Serwer writes, a polling station in a predominantly black neighborhood isn&rsquo;t the best place to go if you&rsquo;re trying to scare white voters off: &#8220;I imagine that the New Black Panthers thought they were protecting black voters from some phantom white-supremacist conspiracy (their public statements say as much).&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Get a grip, folks. The New Black Panther Party is a lunatic fringe group that is clearly into racial theater of minor importance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This case is a one-off. There are plenty of grounds on which to sharply criticize the attorney general  &mdash;  his handling of terrorism questions, just for starters  &mdash;  but this particular overblown attack threatens to undermine the credibility of his conservative critics.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Newsweek says the Panthers are nothing to worry about.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly how Newsweek feels about left-wing, anti-white racist violence against whites.</p>
<p>And if they went just a step further, they would have explained that the real danger to peace and tranquility is the tea partiers.</p>
<p>This magazine, like most far left publications is on the way out.  I&rsquo;m surprised it&rsquo;s still in business quite frankly, especially with the likes of that plucked chicken look from Ellis Hennican spewing his obnoxious ideas on t.v. every chance he gets.</p>

<p>The lefty dregs can call it what they want, but if it is highlighted along with a dozen other black racists, organizations, and events, it aids us tremendously in our quest to alert everybody to the anti-white racism from blacks which has been a one-sided war against whites for the last several years.</p>
<p>This black community organizer and the flakes, oddballs and kooks connected to him or support him is a godsend.  </p>

		<p>If the writer thinks this is a lunatic fringe group of potentially dangerous trouble-makers, why isn&rsquo;t he calling for them to be charged with &#8216;voter intimidation&rsquo;?</p>
<p>The reason to not charge them with voter intimidation, is not because a witness to it has questionable beliefs, and not because the Tea Party did something bad this weak that needs uncovered, but because there was no voter intimidation (which could be the case).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet the media had a different view of this very same &#8216;former kennedy administration official&rsquo; back during &#8216;the 60&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>From the original article&hellip; &#8220;Like the ACORN case, it&rsquo;s not about a real investigation; it&rsquo;s about staging an effective piece of political theater that hurts the Obama administration&#8221;.</p>
<p>What happened to the media as a watch dog of the government? I guess sometimes it&rsquo;s more noble and brave to defend them while at the same time ignoring &#8216;voting rights&rsquo; violations.</p>

<p>So, Christian Adams testimony is questionable, yet we&rsquo;re just supposed to take it on faith, the idea that &#8216;bush&rsquo;s justice department was systematically weakening the civil-rights division&hellip;&rsquo; on faith, with no evidence of this presented whatsoever. Only those like Adams need to provide proof - that&rsquo;s fit to print by this media truth-teller. </p>

<p>hmmm maybe if the OBama administration didn&rsquo;t try to shield them that would help? Or is this writer implying that the obama administration should not be &#8216;hurt&rsquo; or criticized, even if it is doing the wrong thing (many white liberals think this way - if we can just pretend a black president is great.. blacks will love and and we will all hold hands and sing songs about how great diversity is!)</p>

		<p>The important issue here is Obama&rsquo;s reaction to this and every other anti-white situation that has occurred on his watch.  I would have thought that a so-called post-racial President would at least make a gesture or two toward gaining the trust of white people, but he has either done nothing or has gone out of his way to poke them in the eye.  What would it cost him to condemn a small, radical fringe group like the Panthers?  Black support?  Please!  But he loses untold white support by refusing to order Holder to prosecute these thugs.<br>
I saw the video of the Panther menacingly stalking before the polling place and shouting threats.  Why isn&rsquo;t this sufficient evidence?  If a frail, 90-something white lady in a K robe had done the same, the left would have screamed bloody murder.  </p>

		<p>Nah, we don&rsquo;t have to worry abou the Panthers because they are a non-white group that calls for displacement and genocide of white people (especially &#8216;cracker&rsquo; babies), however an alleged &#8216;racist&rsquo; slur from the Tea Party is a crime against humanity.</p>
