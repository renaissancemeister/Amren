			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Vaznis, Boston Globe, July 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The number of Boston school students identified as lacking fluency in English surged dramatically over the past school year, presenting further challenges for a school district already under federal investigation for failing to provide adequate programs for students trying to learn the language.</p>
<p>Such students now number nearly 16,000, about 28 percent of the district&rsquo;s total enrollment, according to new data released by the district. Last fall, the group consisted of more than 11,000 students.</p>
<p>Much of the increase emerged after school officials complied with a federal directive to retest thousands of students who were improperly evaluated over the last seven years for English fluency, causing them not to be identified for services. Those students were tested only on how well they speak and listen in English, but not their ability to read and write in the language.</p>
<p>The retesting effort, carried out over the past six months, identified 4,269 additional students in need of specialized instruction. The students, who have low MCAS scores, run the gamut: Some barely grasp English, while others are almost fluent.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a substantial increase, but this was a once-in-a-lifetime situation&#8221; said Eileen de los Reyes, Boston&rsquo;s assistant superintendent for English-language learners. &#8220;One thing that is very clear to us is that students in this group need an academic intervention.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The rapid increase is adding urgency to the district&rsquo;s efforts to bring programs that serve English-language learners into compliance with state and federal civil rights laws.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boston&rsquo;s retesting of students is a big step forward in bolstering the quality of education for English-language learners and for accepting the failures of the past, said Miren Uriarte, coauthor of a report that called attention to the problems in Boston schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The growth in the number of English-language learners has challenged school districts statewide. Many programs were thrown into disarray, specialists say, after voters in 2002 abolished widespread use of bilingual education, which allows students to learn subjects in their native tongue until they master English.</p>
<p>The new law stresses teaching all subjects in English for nonnative speakers, using a student&rsquo;s native language only sparingly. Instruction generally takes place in a separate setting or in a regular classroom amid native English-speaking students.</p>
<p>In making the switch, many districts, such as Boston, failed to provide appropriate staffing, training, and programs, either because of funding shortages or misunderstanding of the legal requirements, specialists say.</p>
<p>Over the last year, Boston has invested millions of dollars to revamp programs, hire dozens of additional teachers to work directly with English-language learners, and train traditional classroom teachers to work with the students. It is planning to spend another $10 million on such efforts this year.</p>
<p>Some advocates for English-language learners question Boston&rsquo;s ability to properly serve all such students, especially in lean budget times.</p>

		<p>The aim of Federal immigration policy is to increase the number of consumers.  Fluency in English is desired so they can more easily consume more plywood, drywall, gasoline, diapers, soft drinks, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>The Feds have given themselves the role of getting millions of additional warm bodies into the country, and they pass laws to make others responsible for their successful integration into the consumer stream.</p>

<p>Boston has been &#8220;intervening&#8221; in education since forced desegregation in the 1970s.  It hasn&rsquo;t worked.  The average Boston homeowner now pays a cool $4,300 in yearly property taxes!  Over the past 30+ years there have been tremendous increases in taxes and diversity in Boston, while SAT scores have plummeted.<br>

		<p>The &#8216;students&rsquo; who it is hardest to teach English to, and I am speaking from over 15 years teaching experience working with non-whites of every stripe, are mestizo latinos.  Period.</p>
<p>Asian kids learn very, very fast, with parental support and pressure.</p>
<p>The various black people from Africa, Haiti, etc&hellip; get in the rap world and at least pick up spoken Ebonics pretty fast.</p>
<p>White skinned latinos also have a bigger &#8216;in&rsquo; in white society here and learn fast.</p>
<p>The mestizos and full blooded Mexican/Honduran/ etc Indians create a bubble around themselves and revel in their lack of English.</p>

		<p>My father was born in this country in 1913 into an Italian immigrant family and mining community.  He spoke no English until starting first grade in the local school system.  In this respect he was no different from many of his classmates, who were of Lithuanian, Russian, Polish, or Scandinavian extraction.<br>
Only English was allowed during school hours and all homework assigned in English.  Unremarkably, these poor sons and daughters of Minnesota iron miners picked up English immediately (as kids will) and made it their first language in their greater community, though they still typically spoke the mother tongue at home.</p>
<p>My father went on to graduate from the University of Minnestota with a degree in electrical engineering and had a highly successful career.  While his was an immigrant success story, it was hardly remarkable for the time.</p>
<p>Small children are remarkably adaptable little creatures.  They don&rsquo;t have to be &#8220;taught&#8221; a new language.  Immersed in it they quickly pick it up, just as they did their first language.</p>

		<p>John,<br>
I&rsquo;ve taught ESL abroad and my experience with Asians is like you describe. On top of the parental pressure, many of them were just very precocious. I would play little strategy games with some of the 11-12 year olds and I had to be on my toes if I didn&rsquo;t want to get embarassed. I thought about trying to teach in Mexico or South America (just as a way to travel) but I can only imagine how terrible teaching some of those mestizo kids must be. I believe every word you from you about teaching them. I live in Texas so I come in contact with tons of them and they are some of the most unruly (though sometimes warm and sweet) people I&rsquo;ve run across. No discipline. No interest in books or higher learning.</p>
<p>My grandparents could tell a similar yarn about their experiences in school. My father told me that my grandfather got made fun of for a while at school due to his Polish accent. But this hardly stopped him. He didn&rsquo;t become an engineer but grew into a competent, productive member of society and his children (my father and uncles) now own a small electrical business. On my mom&rsquo;s side, both her parents grew up speaking German and Czech. No one helped them learn English. And they&rsquo;d resent any pity heaped on them for having to learn themselves.</p>
<p>I want to teach the public school system here. But the bureaucracy and political correctness involved make me hesistant. I&rsquo;d probably be fired after a year anyways. That&rsquo;s one thing I liked about teaching abroad. I had nothing to worry about pandering to stupidity. </p>

		<p>Get out of the public school system.  Make a big noise about refusing to pay for other&rsquo;s schools when you want to go private or home school and then work with companies that will split the difference for twice the guaranteed GPA and make -that- fact well known too.  So that others will join you.</p>
<p>Let your district politician, school board and chamber of commerce know how close to the edge of &#8216;can&rsquo;t do this anymore&rsquo; you are, even if you&rsquo;re just fine.</p>
<p>If need be, _move_.</p>
<p>Remember, Social Security won&rsquo;t exist for you or your kids.  You may well end up living off of each other&rsquo;s largesse and successful careers are not made in the public school system.  </p>
<p>Probably never were.</p>
<p>Nothing is true.  Everything is permitted.  Fight for your own.</p>

		<p>The comments about Asians learning English are spot on. I was an Air Force brat and in the 1960&rsquo;s I spent my 6th, 7th, and 8th grade years in Japan. As American service people in foreign countries of years past did, we befriended the local population, and one young man who became a dear friend of ours was a Japanese teacher of English in their public schools (English was a required subject in their schools then - I have no clue about now.) He came to our house one night every week to watch the old tv show, &#8220;Password.&#8221; He said it was one of the best television shows to teach English, and he was very involved in the show, spent many hours discussing it, the meaning of the words, the oddities and complexities of the English language, and spelling.</p>
<p>Dedication, effort, and a totally different mindset from virtually everyone today.</p>

		<p>I spent 12 years, good and bad in the Boston schools years ago before the Hispanic invasion. Blacks generally stayed in their own schools in the Roxbury district, or in specific parts of the sprawling Dorchester neighborhood. If a kid showed up from Italy or Russia and didn&rsquo;t speak English, it was too bad. The kid, like the Spanish kids today, generally learned enough oral English on the street to get by. His kids usually wrote and read English as well as average newcomers. Occasionally the kids actually went to college. Their kids almost always did. Evolution,ambition, and desire to assimilate are what make the immigrant dream work. Kick in EsolELL, and other expensive useless federal welfare and subsidy programs that today&rsquo;s educators love and professional immigrant lobbyists demand, and you&rsquo;ll ensure segregation of immigrants and antagonism towards America forever. And, you will continue to have illiteracy in English follow a foreign family from generation to generation.</p>
