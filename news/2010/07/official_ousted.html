			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, July 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Agriculture Department has a lengthy history with the official forced to resign Monday over a controversial YouTube clip  &mdash;  it turns out she and a group she helped found with her husband won millions last year in a discrimination suit settlement with the federal government.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Days before she was appointed to the USDA post last year, her group reportedly won a $13 million settlement in a longstanding discrimination suit against the USDA known commonly as the Pigford case.</p>
<p>The Rural Development Leadership Network announced last summer that New Communities Inc.  &mdash;  a group Sherrod formed with husband Charles, who is a civil rights activist, and with other black farmers  &mdash;  had reached the agreement. The RDLN said the USDA had &#8220;refused&#8221; to offer new loans or restructure old loans to members of New Communities, leading to the discrimination claim.</p>
<p>The announcement said that in addition to the $13 million to New Communities, Shirley and Charles Sherrod would each get $150,000 for &#8220;pain and suffering.&#8221;</p>
<p>A USDA official told FoxNews.com on Tuesday that the settlement had &#8220;nothing to do with&#8221; Sherrod&rsquo;s hiring last year  &mdash;  likewise, the official said her resignation was only the result of her comments in the video.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sherrod&rsquo;s settlement was a drop in the bucket in terms of the money the federal government has paid out in Pigford claims to other black farmers over the years. The suit claimed the USDA racially discriminated against black farmers by not giving them fair treatment when they applied for loans or assistance. The case was first settled in 1999, resulting to date in more than $1 billion in compensation payments from the federal government.</p>
<p>In addition, the Obama administration has called for another $1.15 billion to settle claims for other black farmers  &mdash;  Congress has not yet granted the money.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

								<h2>Shirley Sherrod&rsquo;s Disappearing Act: Not So Fast</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Tom Blumer, Washington Examiner, July 20, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ms. Sherrod&rsquo;s previous background, the circumstances surrounding her hiring, and the USDA&rsquo;s agenda may all play a part in explaining her sudden departure from the agency. These matters have not received much scrutiny to this point.</p>
<p>An announcement of Ms. Sherrod&rsquo;s July 2009 appointment to her USDA position at ruraldevelopment.org gives off quite a few clues:<blockquote>RDLN Graduate and Board Vice Chair Shirley Sherrod was appointed Georgia Director for Rural Development by Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack on July 25. Only days earlier, she learned that New Communities, a group she founded with her husband and other families (see below) has won a thirteen million dollar settlement in the minority farmers law suit Pigford vs Vilsack.<br>
</blockquote>What?</p>
<p>The news that follows at the link, which appears to pre-date the announcement of Ms. Sherrod&rsquo;s appointment, provides further details:<blockquote><b>Minority Farm Settlement</b></p>
<p>Justice Achieved  &mdash;  Congratulations to Shirley and Charles Sherrod!</p>
<p>We have wonderful news regarding the case of New Communities, Inc., the land trust that Shirley and Charles Sherrod established, with other black farm families in the 1960&rsquo;s. At the time, with holdings of almost 6,000 acres, this was the largest tract of black-owned land in the country.</p>
<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Over the years, USDA refused to provide loans for farming or irrigation and would not allow New Communities to restructure its loans. Gradually, the group had to fight just to hold on to the land and finally had to wind down operations.</p>
<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The cash (settlement) award acknowledges racial discrimination on the part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the years 1981-85.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. New Communities is due to receive approximately $13 million ($8,247,560 for loss of land and $4,241,602 for loss of income; plus $150,000 each to Shirley and Charles for pain and suffering). There may also be an unspecified amount in forgiveness of debt. This is the largest award so far in the minority farmers law suit (Pigford vs Vilsack).</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
</blockquote>Here are just a few questions about Ms. Sherrod that deserve answers:</p>
<p>* Was Ms. Sherrod&rsquo;s USDA appointment an unspoken condition of her organization&rsquo;s settlement?</p>
<p>* How much &#8220;debt forgiveness&#8221; is involved in USDA&rsquo;s settlement with New Communities?</p>
<p>* Why were the Sherrods so deserving of a combined $300,000 in &#8220;pain and suffering&#8221; payments  &mdash;  amounts that far exceed the average payout thus far to everyone else? ($1.15 billion divided by 16,000 is about $72,000)?</p>
<p>* Given that New Communities wound down its operations so long ago (it appears that this occurred sometime during the late 1980s), what is really being done with that $13 million in settlement money?</p>

		<p>We have a massive amount of government debt in this country so large that experts are saying we could never pay it back.  That may be so with the Feds current budget but what happens if we eliminate the Department of Education, Energy, Homeland Security, HUD, etc. and reduce the size of other departments like the USDA and make them more efficient by terminating people like Ms. Sherrod?  Many government agencies are little more than jobs programs for affirmative action blacks and their Marxist handlers.  We could save trillions and save America at the same time.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The suit claimed the USDA racially discriminated against black farmers by not giving them fair treatment when they applied for loans or assistance&#8221;.</p>
<p>In other words, all of America is going to have to continue to be prepared (with ironclad, incontrovertible poof) they are discriminating against white men, if they want to be able to win one of these lawsuits on the grounds they aren&rsquo;t &#8216;discriminating&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Sherrod is a blatant racist disregarding of the unprecedented efforts of white Americans to place the race issue behind us.<br>
Sherrod represents a hard core section of blacks striving to<br>
turn white America into a decayed shell by pillaging the treasury and the publics trust in a random, incalculable, and misguided exertion to eliminate our future.<br>
American freedom and the welfare of the world at large are constantly at stake due to devicive policies of Socialism<br>
all to avoid the reality that black shortcomings are genetic.</p>

		<p>I hope incidents like this will turn more and more whites into white nationalists and that will fight back with full force instead of acting like pansies filled with white guilt.  </p>

		<p>Sherrod is merely getting ahead the way black people do, through extortion and intimidation. Jessie Jackson provided the original shake down model for generations to come.  All he had to do was walk into a corporate office and allege discrimination.  Most allegations were phony of course and the CEOs and Jackson knew it.  </p>
<p>But corporations, being realistic, caved.  Knowing that the courts were corrupt and stacked against them, they simply agreed to a payoff.  This was just smart business on their part.  They passed the cost along. </p>
<p>All federal agencies, including the military, are becoming wholly owned by black extortionists.  The federal alphabet agencies exist more and more for the purpose of keeping blacks happy so they won&rsquo;t burn down their neighborhoods and scare a lot of white people. However, the payoffs are getting more expensive as back appetites grow and know no bounds. </p>
<p>Federal statistics show that since the early 1960s blacks have grown more prosperous over time. One wonders what percentage of this is accounted for by Jackson-Sherrod scam extortion schemes, affirmative action NFL,NBA afleaks, and how much is due to honest business and professional growth. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s sickening about the Sherrod incident was all the grovelling done by white conservatives like Coulter, O&rsquo;Reilly,and Beck after they realized that the hasty firing,to which O&rsquo;Reilly agreed, was based on partial information.  </p>
<p>O&rsquo;Reilly spent a good part the &#8220;Factor&#8221; over three days making sure everybody heard his apology. Of course, O&rsquo;Reilly and Beck are always on the prowl for excuses to kiss black butt.  </p>
<p>Limbaugh surprisingly got it right.  After listening to the complete tape, he said in essence that &#8220;Sherrod is still a racist and should be fired for that reason.&#8221; </p>
<p>All of us who have followed the Sherrod incident smell another black extortion scam being worked up against the Ag Department. It never ends.       </p>

		<p>The lamest excuse I know of for excusing bad commentary or putting your foot in the mouth is &#8220;they took my words out of context&#8221; and that excuse has been used a million times. The fact is Sherrod is a racist and said what she said and should be fired, case closed.<br>
    I find it odd that all this attention is given to Shirley Sherrod when we have video presented by Fox News of King Samir Shabazz on a public street with a P.A. system and microphone telling black people to &#8220;kill all white crackers and their white cracker babies&#8221; which was presented close to the same time as the Sherrod incident yet nothing is said about this atrocity and extreme hate by blacks. Even Fox News has said nothing more about it. I suppose that video was also &#8220;taken out of context&#8221;. Ha! Ha! I know what the game is now!  The left wing loonies along with the White House now intend to discredit any factual video that might be presented by their opponents by using this &#8220;out of context&#8221; scam.<br>
   We all know the White House&rsquo;s obsession with Glen Beck mostly because they can never prove him wrong. Beck always presents video and audio to back up what he is saying and they can&rsquo;t do anything about him except call him names like a bunch of little children. Now they can say Glen Beck&rsquo;s video&rsquo;s are all taken out of context and weather it&rsquo;s true of not, and not that it means anything, but they have injected that little bit of doubt in people&rsquo;s minds.  The whole Sherrod thing is nothing but a scam directed from the White House to try and take some credibility from Glen Beck.<br>
    Now I have heard that the left wing media is accusing Fox News of stirring up whites to go against the blacks. The actual fact is that when you tell the truth about what is actually happening out in the streets this will without a doubt start to wake people up. Another actual fact is that the left wing media are the ones that have been stirring up black hatred against whites for the last fifty years with movies about slavery, discrimination, KKK and white Supremist documentaries, ect. They also hide some of the most vicious and horrendous hate crimes perpetrated by blacks against whites like the Wichita Massacre, and the Christian Newsome murders yet the James Byrd pick-up truck dragging was nation-wide front page news in every newspaper, and on every T.V. and radio station across the country and probably the world. These are just a few cases among hundreds with the same implications. This left wing scam makes it look like whites are evil and blacks are saints when exactly the opposite is the real truth, but of course the left wing media knows nothing about the truth.          <br>
    The &#8220;hypocrisy&#8221; of the left is astounding to say the least.  Some day you will look up the word &#8220;liberal&#8221; in the dictionary and it will say &#8220;see hypocrite&#8221; or you will look up the word &#8220;hypocrite&#8221; in the dictionary and it will say &#8220;see liberal&#8221;.     </p>
