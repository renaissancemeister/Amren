<h1><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10607480">UK&rsquo;s Ethnic Minority Numbers &#8216;To Rise to 20% by 2051&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, July 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ethnic minorities are set to make up a fifth of the UK population in 40 years, a University of Leeds study predicts.</p>
<p>It says the proportion of black, Asian and other ethnic minorities will rise from 8% of the population, as recorded in the 2001 census, to 20% by 2051.</p>
<p>Researchers say the population will reach nearly 78 million  &mdash;  up from 59 million in 2001.</p>
<p>One of the authors, Professor Philip Rees, said the UK&rsquo;s ethnic make-up was &#8220;evolving significantly&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Groups outside the white British majority are increasing in size and share, not just in the areas of initial migration, but throughout the country, and our projections suggest that this trend is set to continue through to 2051.</p>
<p>&#8220;At a regional level, ethnic minorities will shift out of deprived inner city areas to more affluent areas, which echoes the way white groups have migrated in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;In particular, black and Asian populations in the least deprived local authorities will increase significantly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Leeds study suggested the population is also set to become more racially diverse as well as less segregated over the coming years.</p>
<p>Prof Rees said the number of people identifying themselves as being of &#8220;mixed race&#8221; would rise from 1.2% to 4.2%.</p>
<p>The study, based on computer modelling, suggested white British and Irish populations would grow slowly while the &#8220;other white&#8221; ethnic group would be extremely fast growing.</p>
<p>This was because of expected high levels of immigration from Europe, Australasia and the US.</p>
<p>In 2051 the number of British people classed as white was predicted to be 79%, compared with 92% now, the research suggests.</p>
<p><b>Projections</b></p>
<p>The researchers formed their predictions following a three-year study.</p>
<p>The results include population projects for England&rsquo;s 352 local authorities and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland for every year over the next 40 years.</p>
<p>They examined ethnic population trends at a local scale in the UK and then used a computer model to project those trends under a variety of scenarios in the future.</p>
<p>They also used data already available on the 16 ethnic groups that had been used in the 2001 census and also considered other demographic factors including immigration, emigration, fertility and mortality.</p>
<p>But Prof Rees, said it was not an exact science.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;It is impossible to predict exactly how people will move into, out of and within the country .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as all of these trends are influenced by a whole range of socio-economic factors.&#8221;</p>
<p>BBC UK Affairs Correspondent Tom Symonds said although immigration to the UK had increased over the last decade, official statistics show birthrate is playing a bigger part in changing the make-up of the population.</p>
<p><b>Baby boost</b></p>
<p>He said the statistics show that, in particular, recent immigrants are more likely to be of child-bearing age, resulting in something of a baby boom.</p>
<p>The Leeds researchers say they expect minority groups to move from deprived local authorities to more affluent areas.</p>
<p>Other groups set to increase rapidly include those of south Asian origin and from countries such as India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, where immigration into the UK has been high in the past.</p>
<p>In October the Office for National Statistics predicted the population would exceed 70m by 2029.</p>
<p>Last week the government announced it was examining other ways of measuring population and other statistics rather than carrying out an expensive census.<br>

<p>I believe press releases like this are part of an effort at both conditioning the public and testing the waters.</p>
<p>I also take exception to its tone. The study makes it sound like yearly immigration is as unchangeable as the weather, rather than the variable that it is.  The researchers can&rsquo;t make &#8220;projections&#8221; on future immigration policy.</p>
<p>Professor Rees should have prefaced his study by saying that future immigration from the Third World is merely a hypothetical guess.  </p>
<p>The British could also halt all immigration, and provide incentives for recent migrants to leave, which would produce a significantly different set of numbers. </p>

<p>This is certainly an underestimate.</p>
<p>Look at the excel tables on this UK Government site:<br>
<a href="https://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=14238" rel="nofollow">https://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=14238</a></p>
<p>If you perform some calculations it shows the following percentages for non-whites in 2001 and 2007:</p>
<p>2001:<br>
Births (2002 data): 15%<br>
Ages 0-15: 13%<br>
All ages: 8.8%</p>
<p>2007:<br>
Births: 18% (increase of 3 points in 6 years)<br>
Ages 0-15: 15% (increase of 2 points in 6 years)<br>
All ages: 11.3% (increase of 2.5 points in 6 years)</p>
<p>If that rate of increase continues it will certainly reach 20% much earlier than 2051.<br>

		<p>Within 100 years you can go from the most powerful nation on earth to this.  I&rsquo;ve never been to Great Britain but there must be a tremendous guilt conscious because of the mighty British Empire and/ or an incredible sense of charity that the British must spread their wealth and resources around to produce a never ending stream of giveaways to non-Britons.  Whatever it is, you will never change these people into Mr. and Mrs. Anglo.</p>

		<p>Good points poster number 1.  Just because posters such as myself, don&rsquo;t like the pessimism on this website, that by no way means we are denying the realities that articles such as this convey.  </p>
<p>I am just stating what poster number 1 is stating:   Predictions are merely predictions.  Anybody on here who continuously insists the worst case scenarios for the white race, has very little faith in their own people.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a professor and he hasn&rsquo;t factored in the possibility of large scale conflict and an economy that plummets so low it will be bankrupt?  And, remember those are the words of economic experts in the UK, not mine.  Apparently all these radical, white professors are so busy being brilliant they just don&rsquo;t have time to do their work properly, taking all things into consideration, especially since the future is not set in stone.</p>
<p>I might suggest that he dig real hard to find out where these people are going to work, especially since the UK&rsquo;s job situation will unequivocally weaken and could be reduced down to survival levels and the UK society will split apart into tribal, ethnic, racial enclaves and many will be lost in their coming civil war.</p>
<p>I mean, as long as he feels compelled to throw white reduction in our face he could at least factor in all the likely possibilities as well.</p>

		<p>Three problems make this much worse than in the US.</p>
<p>1.  There are no secluded white neighborhoods to flee from non-whites to.</p>
<p>2.  Totalitarian laws force Brits to accept being raped, robbed, murdered and beaten by non-whites&hellip;..and most white Brits seem to like it that way&hellip;.until, of course, they are the victims.  All those not immediate victims tend to attack those who are victims, blame them, and go out of the way to destroy them for ANY behavior even smacking of self-defense (or even complaints).  Britain is one of the few places on the planet where a white person risks prison, for complaining about being victimized.</p>
<p>3.  No guns means no real power for anyone to resist.  Again, most Brits seem to like it this way.</p>
<p>For the few Brits who want to be free of this, the only recourse is emmigration&hellip;&hellip;while it is still allowed.  Britain is very close to being like the old Soviet Union&hellip;..complete with Iron Curtain, to keep the wealth, and skilled labor from fleeing.</p>
<p>Recent changes to British laws have basically suspended democracy in that country.  The process still exists but it&rsquo;s a joke.  The elections might as well be rigged or one party only.</p>

___________________________</p>
<p> - Who is it that they think they&rsquo;re kidding with these bogus statistics?  There is no way that it will take 40 years for Britain to be only 20% non-British (i.e. non-White).  Just like it&rsquo;s not going to take another 32 years for Whites to be a minority in the U.S.A.  Did you ever take a look at London?  This is more like 10 years, not 40.  I believe that the purpose of feeding us these stats is to: </p>
<p>1.  Lull us into a false sense of security thinking that we have lots of time.<br>
2.  Make us think that this transformation cannot be reversed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just echoing Jared Taylor&rsquo;s words here but do people understand that at some point in time Whites are going to be a hated and hunted minority in all previously White countries just like in South Africa?</p>

		<p>Well, Blue Blood, I&rsquo;ve been to the UK several times, but I remember my first time most vividly.  I first visited London in 2001, in fact I was there on September 11th.  The Brits held a prayer ceremony at St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathefral and the street was filled with mostly white, English faces.  The crowd was very orderly and quiet, and I really felt at home there, and during  the rest of my stay there I went about London like most tourists.  What struck me was shopping in the many large department stores along Oxford Street.  Most of the help was foreign.  I stopped in a cyber cafe and was waited upon by an Indian.  It seems they have bought up a lot of the smaller shops along Oxford, luggage and clothing stores as well.  Store after store I hardly ran into any native Brits.  Most of the cab drivers are foreign too except for the ones that drive the standard black cabs.  In short, it looked a lot like downtown Chicago to me.  I&rsquo;d say most of the help seemed friendly except for one Nigerian I ran into at the British museum.  I must have been too white for him as he curtly handed me my ticket for a special exhibit.  The Muslims want to build a mosque in Oxford and if they don&rsquo;t get their way now they probably will in the near future.  I hope to visit there again soon but will bypass London for possibly Plymouth, England where I hope to find real English people.</p>

		<p>While I am a proud American, I have been lucky to been able to work and live in the UK for a couple of months a few years ago.  I liked everything about the country, and will always consider myself to be a little bit British as a result of the experience.  I spent the majority of my time in rural Yorkshire, Cornwall, and London.</p>
<p>One thing I really liked was the common background of the people and the way they shared a history and belief system.  I felt much more at home in the average pub than I would have trying to fit into an American bar, because the people were very much like me.</p>
<p>If this article is true, and I fear that it is, the UK will have lost something very special that cannot be easily replaced or repaired.</p>

		<p>To those who don&rsquo;t like the pessimism here: If you are a half full glass person, you should check and see if the water is being poured into the glass or poured out of the glass, this will show what you should think about the state of affairs in AmeriKa. Not even taking into consideration that the glass is already 2/3 empty as we speak. Also the fact that we are showing no faith in other whites is based purely on fact. I personally have no alliance whatsoever with the ruling class marxists, or their enabler white haters. Just being white skinned does not mean anything as far as I am concerned, in fact it brings to light the old saying about a wolf in sheeps clothing, which in this case is poorly disguised at best.</p>

<p>This is so true and I know this will be the case because I have worked in inner city public schools for years now.  EVERY young white female &#8216;English&rsquo; teacher spends the ENTIRE year pushing a &#8216;social justice/whites are bad&rsquo; curriculum filled with &#8216;novels&rsquo; by non-whites whining about how oppressed they are.</p>
<p>Every history teacher under the age of 30 spends the ENTIRE year focusing on the evils of whitey through the centuries and &#8216;vibrancy&rsquo; of the non-whites and their enlightened cultures.</p>
<p>White male math teachers are routinely pushed out in schools all over the place in favor of #1 black teachers (male or female), #2 latina teachers, #3 white females and #4 Asians, if they can be found.  (In my observation, black and latino students have no respect for asian teachers.)</p>
<p>If you assume that classrooms all over America are indoctrination centers telling non-whites how bad whitey is, when they have power, we&rsquo;re toast!</p>
<p>I had to laugh once while watching a &#8216;righteous&rsquo; black woman teaching her class some book about blacks in the segregation era.  As if she were oblivious to me in the back of the room grading my papers, she went on for over half an hour about how bad whites are.  </p>
<p>I chuckled because none of the black and latino students in that school have ANY contact with whites at all outside of a few white teachers.  They live in all non-white neighborhoods, go to non-white owned stores and other public places, all their local politicians and most of the cops and city workers are non-white just like them, they can come and go as they please and benefit from tons of government support paid for by the taxes of white people, and they never have anyone oppressing them but other people who look like them!</p>
<p>The world is truly upside down.</p>

		<p>WHITE SLAVE,</p>
<p>As an optimist, I am not going to waste my time anymore with these back and forth arguments between posters such as myself and the pessimists on here.  We can argue all day and night about who is right and who is not.</p>
<p>It boils down to this.  As an optimist, my goals are to focus on the positive, stay hopeful, and do my part to move our race forward.  Now I would like to know what the goals of the pessimists are, and what they are doing to help us as a race.</p>
<p>I am waiting&hellip;.go on and tell me&hellip;.As of right now, it seems all that pessimists do is tell everyone that whites have no future as if we should just do away with websites like this and not even try anymore&hellip;&hellip;we should all go home and cry and pout, and wait for the destruction of our race to come about.</p>
<p>If this is so, then please do this on your own time.  Don&rsquo;t try to pull people like me down with you, by discouraging me.</p>

		<p>A recent post on Sarah Maid of Albions blog quoted official stats that 30% of those awaiting free NHS transplants were of (East) Indian origin or black. I made the point that they are either already 30% of the population or that they disproportionatly use government funded services like the NHS. Either way it is not good. <br>

<p>Although, if you just count England, that ratio will be far more non-White (then and now); apparently, W.A.S.P.s are being colonized world-wide in a hurry. That&rsquo;ll teach them to bring about the bulk of what&rsquo;s considered &#8220;modern civilization!&#8221;</p>

		<p>#14: I have been perusing Amren for years now and have failed to see those who are realists/pessimists as you call us, call for the demise of Amren. Amren is a lone voice in the wilderness calling it like it is. Only those on the left who are optimistically satisfied with the state of affairs should be wanting to silence this voice, and they are. Just as Paul Revere we are calling out a warning to white America. The list of ideas offerred up by the realists here is endless. &#8220;We should all go home and cry and pout and waitfor the destruction of our race?&#8221; Ludicrous!! I suggest we all go home and don our rose colored glasses pull out our wine coolers lay back and let the good times roll. What are these positive things we should be focusing on? The fact we have the most leftist administration in the history of our country, the fact that we have just appointed two of the most radical leftist judges on the supremes who are fairly young and will rule for decades,the fact that we can&rsquo;t say certain words lest we be incarcerated, that we are being inundated with hoards of parasites whose goal is to overthrow the country, that we have a fascist leader with poised pen waiting to declare martial law enforced by the interpol police, giving away our sovereignty on a daily basis,  having control of the news media, the schools, and the list is endless. Were I a leftist, I also would be extremely optimistic. Brother MARX&rsquo;s dream is certainly coming true. Optimism needs replaced by activism if we are to overcome all this. You can&rsquo;t fight the enemy unless you identify him, the so called pessimists here are doing just that. Sorry if this breaks your bubble.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s easy to understand why Britian would allow itself to be destroyed by nonwhite immigration from even the most violent parts of the world.<br>
Most whites throughout the country are socialized and communized beyond reason.<br>
Infact, the only time thousands of British regain a sense of reality is when they are forced to flee the country for their safety and wellbeing.<br>
Although I am an American, I still love England and support a nationwide American effort to bring the message of jesus christ and a sense of white european pride to our fellow Britons who are being systematically alienated by their government.</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
Yes I agree with poster #5. You go on these websites and everybody&rsquo;s complaining. All complaints with no solutions. I want to hear more about solutions. It&rsquo;s almost as if us whites are resigned to becoming a minority. Not what you would call a true fighting spirit! Some solutions: Start racial profiling. Close down immigration, except for people from Europe (you will be called a racist, but so what, it&rsquo;s better than becoming a minority in your own country). Cut out the birtright citizen nonsense. Deny welfare to all illegal aliens and their children. Have severe penalties for companies that hire illegals. We can get our country back but you have to have the stomach for it. It won&rsquo;t be easy or pleasant.</p>

		<p>Okay, WHITE SLAVE, there is no reason for us to be going at each other&rsquo;s throats over this.  We are both concerned about our race and that is all that matters.  </p>
<p>I am on here because I care about the future of my people, and that is all that should matter to people, whether I am an optimist or not.</p>
<p>When pessimists post on here, I hardly see them proposing plans&hellip;.all they do is predict the worst case scenarios.  I am glad that you are using your pessimism for a cause.  That is all I really needed to know.</p>

		<p>Of course these numbers are a fantasy. And to make it even worse, as whites evaporate, it will be old whites left at the mercy of young browns. It will be a bloodbath. The beginnings of it are already being seen in South Africa and the US.</p>

		<p> Don&rsquo;t be pessimistic or optimistic, there&rsquo;s no time for wine coolers nor defeatism. Fight this horrible destruction of our civilization with all of your hearts. Learn how to fight, learn how to use weapons (both are important). Educate your children, keep them out of ghetto environments. Teach them ethnic pride, and that criminal culture is their enemy.  Mobilize, rebel by what ever means necessary. The blacks were successful with their civil rights movement when they were a smaller minority. We can also be successful. Keep fighting our enemies politically, intellectually, and physically. NEVER back down. </p>
