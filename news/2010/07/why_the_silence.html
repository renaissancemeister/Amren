<h1><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/16/AR2010071604081_pf.html">Why the Silence From the Post on Black Panther Party Story?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Alexander, Washington Post, July 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For months, readers have contacted the ombudsman wondering why The Post hasn&rsquo;t been covering the case. The calls increased recently after competitors such as the New York Times and the Associated Press wrote stories. Fox News and right-wing bloggers have been pumping the story. Liberal bloggers have countered, accusing them of trying to manufacture a scandal.</p>
<p>But The Post has been virtually silent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The controversy was elevated last month when J. Christian Adams, a former Justice Department lawyer who had helped develop the case, wrote in the Washington Times that his superiors&rsquo; decision to reduce its scope was &#8220;motivated by a lawless hostility toward equal enforcement of the law.&#8221; Some in the department believe &#8220;the law should not be used against black wrongdoers because of the long history of slavery and segregation,&#8221; he wrote. Adams recently repeated these charges in public testimony before the commission.</p>
<p>The Post didn&rsquo;t cover it. Indeed, until Thursday&rsquo;s story, The Post had written no news stories about the controversy this year. In 2009, there were passing references to it in only three stories.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s prompted many readers to accuse The Post of a double standard. {snip}</p>
<p>To be sure, ideology and party politics are at play. Liberal bloggers have accused Adams of being a right-wing activist (he insisted to me Friday that his sole motivation is applying civil rights laws in a race-neutral way). {snip}</p>
<p>The Post should never base coverage decisions on ideology, nor should it feel obligated to order stories simply because of blogosphere chatter from the right or the left.</p>
<p>But in this case, coverage is justified because it&rsquo;s a controversy that screams for clarity that The Post should provide. If Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and his department are not colorblind in enforcing civil rights laws, they should be nailed. If the Commission on Civil Rights&rsquo; investigation is purely partisan, that should be revealed. If Adams is pursuing a right-wing agenda, he should be exposed.</p>

<p>Sounds like McCarthy logic&hellip; if someone is a communist, we have a right to know that - for it to be, &#8216;exposed&rsquo;. I happend to agree with McCarthy. I find it very likely I would disagree with Andrew Alexander and everything he stands for. Now there is a figure that needs exposed!</p>

&gt;&gt;Liberal bloggers have accused Adams of being a right-wing activist (he insisted to me Friday that his sole motivation is applying civil rights laws in a race-neutral way). </p>
<p>Questions for ombudsman Andrew Alexander and others of his ilk: </p>
<p>Is it possible for a &#8220;right-wing activist&#8221; to favor applying civil rights laws in a race-neutral way, or are race neutrality and right-wing activism mutually exclusive? </p>
<p>I ask because I find it interesting that leftists seem to identify as their opposition anyone who favors equal application of the law. </p>

<p>Laughably true, but so what?</p>
<p>Given the &ldquo;newspaper&rdquo; in question, what else is new?</p>
<p>When &ldquo;The Post&rdquo; runs a detailed and lengthy series on what happened in Knoxville and gruelingly apologizes for the feeding frenzy they participated in covering what was once called &ldquo;The Duke Rape Case,&rdquo; maybe I will take them seriously.</p>
<p>Maybe?</p>
<p>Until that point, they can go straight to the devil.</p>

		<p>The Post couldn&rsquo;t cover the story, because they couldn&rsquo;t avoid pointing out that the perps were black.</p>

		<p>Actually, more recent evidence has surfaced that the incident where this event took place was in a predominately Black neighborhood. The percentage of Blacks is like 90% I remember conservative radio and talk show host,Michael Smerconish discussing this fact. Therefore, it seems that most of the people who would be voting in that district would have voted for Obama anyway.</p>
<p>I have to say that this seems to be much ado about very little. sometimes the media does overstate things. </p>

<p>I agree with you and Michael Smerconish on this one. Time to move on. This does not help the cause of race realism at all. It is nothing more than a diversionary tactic used by the mainstream media to promote their largely anti-White agenda.</p>
