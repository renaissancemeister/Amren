	<p>There was outrage, there was looting and there were skirmishes between police and protesters, but that wasn&rsquo;t the whole story of how Oakland reacted to the Johannes Mehserle verdict.</p>
<p>The trouble Thursday boiled down to a racially diverse mob of about 200 people, many bent on destruction no matter what, confronting police after the day&rsquo;s predominantly peaceful demonstrations ended.</p>
<p>Sporadic conflicts were quelled quickly early in the evening, but by late night at least 50 people  &mdash;  and maybe as many as 100  &mdash;  had been arrested as small groups smashed windows, looted businesses and set trash bins on fire.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They smashed windows of shops including the trendy Ozumo restaurant, and one building was spray painted with the words, &#8220;Say no to work. Say yes to looting.&#8221;</p>
<p>A boutique called Spoiled was spared. It had a sign outside and pictures of Oscar Grant with the words, &#8220;Do not destroy. Black owned. Black owned.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Outsiders</b></p>
<p>Officials said the main instigators appeared to be organized &#8220;anarchist&#8221; agitators wearing black clothing and hoods. Many of the most aggressive demonstrators smashing the windows of banks and shops were white.</p>
<p>Community leaders had called for nonviolence, and during the day most of the rage from those who thought Mehserle should have been convicted of a more serious charge was confined to loudspeakers and animated conversations on the asphalt. But, as many community leaders had predicted for weeks, a determined knot of renegades faced off with the police who surrounded the protesters. They taunted the officers and threw bottles and rocks.</p>
<p>Around 8:30 p.m., officers corralled hundreds of people on Broadway between 13th and 14th streets. Tensions ratcheted up, and finally the police declared an unlawful assembly, put on gas masks and pulled out their clubs. Through loudspeakers, officers ordered the crowd to move north up Broadway or they would be subject to arrest or force.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Looting</b></p>
<p>One group tore through the metal gate protecting a Footlocker shoe store on Broadway near 14th Street, shattered a window and emptied the shelves. Soon there were shoe boxes on the street.</p>
<p>Afterward, the group moved across the street and smashed a window at the Far East National Bank building and rampaged inside. Graffiti was sprayed on the bank wall reading &#8220;Riot for Oscar.&#8221; Up and down Broadway within the police lines, skirmishes broke out between officers and small groups of protesters, some wearing black face paint.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The trouble dribbled to a close around 10:45 p.m., after officers finally chased away or arrested the last of the hard-core group of about 100 looters.</p>
<p><b>Calmer earlier</b></p>
<p>Earlier in the afternoon, when the demonstrations were more organized, the mood was also angry  &mdash;  but by and large nonviolent.</p>
<p>Tony Coleman, a community organizer with New Years Movement 4 Justice for Oscar Grant  &mdash;  the black man shot Jan. 1, 2009, by then-BART police Officer Mehserle, who is white  &mdash;  was one of the first speakers at the podium as hundreds gathered at 14th Street and Broadway.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The confrontations during daylight were quick: At about 5:30 p.m., protesters surrounded police officers at 13th and Broadway and at 12th and Broadway, pelting officers with rocks and bottles and pulling down police barricades. Police quelled the disturbances quickly.</p>
<p>Nearby, in front of City Hall, a separate group of ministers and community leaders set up their own event with loudspeakers, and throughout the afternoon there were calls for further justice  &mdash;  but just as many calls for peaceful reaction.</p>
<p>Public gatherings also took place at five community centers throughout Oakland designated as &#8220;speakout centers&#8221; where people could vent their feelings. The mood was often hostile.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Exodus</b></p>
<p>Early in the afternoon, when word spilled out around 2:30 p.m. that a verdict would be read at 4 p.m., Oakland experienced an exodus just a few ticks short of panic.</p>
<p>Downtown streets suddenly were flooded with people rushing out of their workplaces to go home. BART trains streaming in and out of downtown were jammed, and nearby Interstates 880 and 980 filled.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Community groups, police and city leaders had been laying plans for months to keep reaction protests peaceful. But many were still leery, considering the riots that broke out in Oakland in January 2009 in reaction to Grant&rsquo;s killing by Mehserle. Several businesses downtown were boarded up in anticipation of trouble.</p>
<p>By 2:30 p.m., police had blocked off 11th and Clay streets and other intersections with cars and barricades. Argus, the Oakland police helicopter that had been grounded because of budget cuts unless there was an emergency, buzzed in the air.</p>
<p><b>When verdict was read</b></p>
<p>A dozen people sat on barstools in stunned silence watching television at the Pacific Coast Brewery in downtown Oakland when the verdict was read. One man booed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&rsquo;s bad,&#8221; said Ivan Davis, 43, of Oakland, who is African American. &#8220;That&rsquo;s bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>As much as many wanted a conviction on a more serious charge, downtown protester Scott Larockwell, 32, said he took heart that Mehserle was at least convicted of something.</p>

		<p>When the writing was on the wall and when the old Soviet Union finally broke up all the communist organisations began to promote &#8216;anarchist&rsquo;. The American Communist Party even stopped fielding a candidate for president. It&rsquo;s pretty much the same rhetoric except that they see the former Soviet Union as &#8216;oppressive&rsquo; too, although their real enemy always seems to be &#8216;the white male system&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re rioting because Mehserle was convicted for IM and not Murder 2.  But I&rsquo;ve already read that he&rsquo;d have to do 2-4 for the IM, plus 4-10 not concurrently because he used a gun, thereby violating the Deukmejian-era &#8220;extra time for crimes with guns&#8221; laws.  Now Holder wants to step in, and that means another 10 years.  Combine that with truth and sentencing laws, and Mehserle is going to do 20 years   &mdash;   More than some people convicted of Murder 2 wind up doing.</p>
<p>However, I think it&rsquo;s all moot   &mdash;   Mehserle is dead in his first day in the general population.</p>
<p>White cops in the Bay Area   &mdash;   quit now while you still have a life and freedom. </p>

<p>We&rsquo;re not confused. </p>
<p>The blacks used this opportunity to loot.  They use all opportunities for looting.   Robbery, rape, murder- it&rsquo;s all just a form of looting to the blacks.  They are excitable and dangerous. Whites just can&rsquo;t understand the typical black&rsquo;s lack of self control and propensity for looting, thus not understanding it, the typical White falls back on what they&rsquo;ve been taught and blame themselves for &#8220;not doing enough hard work to atone for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White Privileges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some Whites deserve the looting, but you won&rsquo;t find them running private businesses. They are in government, politics, academics, and religion.  <br>

		<p>Does racial diversity bring communities together or does racial diversity tear communities apart?  </p>
<p>If the latter, then why on Earth do the elitist in our government attempting to increase diversity in America, by importing millions of non-Europeans? </p>
<p>We know from history that virtually all wars have been fought over some sort of diversity   &mdash;   racial, ethnic, language, religion, culture, economic, political, etc.  </p>
<p>Knowing that diversity can lead to warfare and even genocide, why does our government seek to increase diversity in the USA?  </p>

<p>But they dance with glee when they find a handful of mentally-ill White race traitors in the mob, and make absolutely sure that we know all about it.<br>

		<p>I watched a video of the looting I didn&rsquo;t see any white looters at all as a matter of fact I bet most white folks didn&rsquo;t want to be anywhere near the crowd as they looted the Foot Locker. I remember Reginald Denny who should have been awarded 40,000,000 dollars instead of Rodney King. </p>
<p>This keeps coming to a head in the age of Obama I love hearing this New Black Panther guy talk. King Shabazz really tell it like it is and he hates anyone who shows the world his true colors. He hates the crackers and the crackers hate him. </p>

		<p>There is a black Oakland ambulance chasing lawyer in Oakland named Burris who is pursuing a wrongful death suit against BART of $25 million for the Grant killing.He was really unhappy  about the conviction of Mehserly being for voluntary manslaughter rather than murder 2.When the 4 Oakland rougue police officers known as the Riders were acquitted about 5 years ago, his face was longer than the Nile River.The happiest I ever saw him, however was after O.J. Simpson was let off for the double killing.</p>

		<p>I know that I say time and time again on here that I am done listening to Micheal S. (can&rsquo;t spell out his last name on this site because it won&rsquo;t go through the filters), but I guess I keep crawling back to him like an abused woman keeps running back to her husband ( I have a friend on this website who uses that analogy against me on this topic all the time).  But seriously, there is something about his show that keeps me coming back.  A lot of people on here, including myself, think he stands up for white people.</p>
<p>Well, tonight he told the lie of all lies.  He said that the father who was upset over the death of his son in this story was a hero and that he was trying to advise everyone to keep the violence down, and that meanwhile most of the people commiting violence during the riots were white hippies.</p>
<p>The more I listen to his show, the more I learn that he could care less about white people.  At one time I thought he was the closest thing we had in mainstream media.  He makes me sick.  But hey, who else in the mainstream media do we have to listen to?  At least he makes good points on top of his blunders!</p>
<p>Oh wait&hellip;.never mind.   Just now as I am sitting here he started talking about a woman in India who flushed her infant down a toilet.  He said that this is the type of behavior he would expect from a oversexualized &#8220;sl*t&#8221; in a Western country (he might have even said the word &#8220;white&#8221;), but not from a poor Hindu who respects life. Then he went on to blame her behavior on the &#8220;influence&#8221; she picked up on while living in a Western country to get her degree&hellip;.Okay&hellip;.that is it!  I am done with his show.  I am turning his show off right now.</p>
<p>By the way, if you haven&rsquo;t figured out who I am talking about, this is his website <a href="https://www.michaelsavage.wnd.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.michaelsavage.wnd.com/</a>,  which he usually acts much more racially conscious on than he does on his show.</p>

		<p>On NBC NIGHTLY NEWS, the reporter for this story described the criminal looting and violence as a &#8220;protest&#8221; against the injustice of the police officer&rsquo;s conviction of involuntary manslaughter.</p>
<p>Reality: The cop&rsquo;s career is over, he will go to a state pen where he will be killed or maimed. </p>

<p>The only reason, and I mean ONLY reason why the black looters tolerated the presence of the few white anarchists is because it was a police shooting so the anarchists could say they were also against the oppressive &#8220;man.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whites, I&rsquo;m sure, also remained close to banks and other safer places.  They weren&rsquo;t running down the alleys smashing little bodegas.</p>
<p>And why did they only mention &#8220;white&#8221; when a specific race of trouble makers was identified?</p>
<p>As for the anarchists, they need to be stripped of their citizenship and sent to the Congo or someplace like that.  Then they can experience the joys of true anarchy.</p>

<p>Agree.  Michael Alan Weiner has a real blind spot for blacks; he claims to know everything there is to know about blacks because he sometimes talks with two or three in a bar that are affirmative action suit-wearing types.</p>
<p>All I can advise you with him is that he is not one of us.  He is who he is and what he is, and to me, that is a strange mixture of neo-con and paleo-con, and tries to pass himself off as a non-racial nationalist (though that&rsquo;s a contradiction in terms, IMHO).  </p>
<p>I can believe the rioting in Oakland is half leftist whites and half black.  In the weeks leading up to the verdict, the provocation for riots was half leftist white and half black extremists:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/326bmyf" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/326bmyf</a></p>
<p>Michael Alan Weiner thought that Kobe Bryant didn&rsquo;t commit rape and that the woman who I now believe to be the victim of his rape was making it all up.  I was on the fence until an occasional AR poster clued me into the news that the victim got a rape kit, and it showed injuries indicative of rape.  </p>
<p>Weiner&rsquo;s problem is that he&rsquo;s too obsessed with liberalism on a doctrinaire level.  We deal with is practical consequences on the ground.  (Though Weiner is an affirmative action victim, and Jewish, so it doesn&rsquo;t appear that The So-Called Tribe is as tribal as some of our people would like to think.)</p>

		<p>  Anarchists are agent provocateurs on the payroll of one of George Soros organizations  They are not anarchists at all, and inside them beats the heart of a Stalinist. Its the same old story we see everywhere. They will receive a slap on the hand,and will not be prosecuted and receive serious jail sentences.

<p>A rape kit can show that intercourse took place but not whether it was consensual or not. Should a suspect claim he was never intimate w/his accuser he may get convicted if the kit indicates the presence of his semen or pubic hair on her.</p>
<p>However, once a suspect like Kobe admits there was intercourse the rape kit becomes practically useless. This is one reason that date rape/ acquaintance rape cases are so hard to prove.  </p>

<p>About this topic-Time and again, it has been shown that blacks will riot over any imagined slight simply because they can then take whatever they want for free.  Any old excuse will do.  The media has deliberately, in most cases, left out the fact that the rioters were black.  It might get people thinking about what is really going on.</p>

<p>Question Diversity - Michael Alan Weiner has found a riff and is playing it over and over&hellip;because it sells. I stopped listening to him when I realized that it isn&rsquo;t good for a person to listen to someone throwing tempter tantrums all the time. Plus, after I turned him off for a while, then turned him back on, it became apparent that the tone of his show had changed.</p>

		<p>Mehserle will probably never make it to general population.  He&rsquo;ll be in administrative segregation (i.e. protective custody).  Doing the whole sentence on 23-hour lockdown won&rsquo;t be a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>Truth be told, the shooting probably wasn&rsquo;t intended.  Mehserle said in court he was reaching for what he thought was his taser, which he carried cross-draw style on his left hip.  In his haste, he grabbed the pistol he carried on his right hip.  While Grant was prone and unarmed, he was resisting Mehserle&rsquo;s attempts to cuff him, so use of the taser was certainly warranted.  All in all, this was a very unfortunate incident, and the IM verdict seems fair.  The lessons to be learned here are &#8220;do not resist arrest&#8221; and &#8220;be really sure which weapon you are pulling out if you have more than one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hypocritical so-called &#8220;anarchists&#8221; would not enjoy genuine anarchy, because the only thing that prevents normal citizens from gunning looters and arsonists down in the streets and summarily executing those who try to surrender are the legal consequences of doing so.<br>

		<p>Question Diversity - good comments.  I said the same to my hubby last night - that poor guy is as good as dead.  If he&rsquo;s out on bail, he ought to run; I think I&rsquo;d rather die by my own hand (yes, even despite my Christian faith) than by the brutal savagery of the enrichers.  Any verdict or punishment other than death, when it&rsquo;s white on black, goes against black-run-America&rsquo;s (I prefer NRA - I&rsquo;m sure you know what I mean) goals.  Surely no one here is really surprised.</p>

		<p>Big Mistake.</p>
<p>There were what, 5 other officers at the incident scene?  Several of them are standing there when each should have been face to face with a designated control subject to make sure intimidation kept actual violence low.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what planet those cops are from but until the suspects are all cuffed, nobody should be even approaching them alone.</p>
<p>Next, once it&rsquo;s close, one partner controls, _the other one_ applies additional force as needed.  Every department, everywhere, knows this.  It&rsquo;s SOP.</p>
<p>Once you are on the suspect to cuff him, you stay on and get the job done.  And until or unless your partner calls off, you _never_ take your hands off to go for your own piece.  Period.</p>
<p>Even if he&rsquo;s going for a weapon, you fight him where you&rsquo;re at.  It&rsquo;s faster and meaner and more apt to shock a threat out of being stupid.  Cops are taught a lot of less than lethal close combat techniques that will put a resisting perp right the hell down with just a few quick blows.</p>
<p>Better a busted jaw than a bullet ricochet off concrete that close.</p>
<p>I also find it strange that Mehserle was riding a live weapon on his hip.  If he had the presence of mind to bring that 226 to a typical PD (both hands) combat sight, take the safety off and pull through the release on the double action for that first shot, he knew exactly which piece he was using.</p>
<p>All the more so if he had the presence of mind to be yelling for his partner to get back.</p>
<p>I would have found a much more plausible defense being the fact that he was already pumped from a separate incident (with a weapon involved) that had just happened with another young man at a prior station.  Added to this, his relative lack of experience, and I would be more willing to say circumstances mediated his response.</p>
<p>I hate to say this, but it looks to me like a LEO, who shouldn&rsquo;t have been a cop at that moment, screwed up and will end up doing less than the time he deserves to for it.</p>

<p>At least until the Feds get a second chew on the &#8216;double sovereign&rsquo; jeopardy steak.</p>
<p>The problem is, you are -always- a police officer.  And you cannot step away from that responsibility.  With only 2 years of experience, he should not in fact have been the lead agent dealing with Grant, his partner Pirone should have.</p>
<p>That said, if anybody deserves to sue BART, (and Oakland PD) it&rsquo;s the owners of those shops.  There was absolutely no excuse for permitting that kind of &#8216;blowing off steam&rsquo; destruction to happen.  It sets a precedent like a record that the next bunch will try to break.  Remember Rodney.</p>

<p><br>
That is a very good   &mdash;   and very important   &mdash;   question.  </p>
<p>Who makes these things popular or unpopular?  Who controls the opinion-making apparatus of society?  Who dictates what shall be the fashions in everything, from clothing to ideas?  What we need is to wrest this control of the  &#8220;opinion industry&#8221; and turn it around to serve ourselves and our own interests for a change. </p>
<p>Young people, college students and such, do not really have any opinions of their own (although they flatter themselves to think so). They haven&rsquo;t lived enough yet. They can&rsquo;t comprehend that, of course.  All they know is what has been fed to them. But yet, lacking any balancing points of view or any conflicting experiences, they can be intensely passionate about the righteousness of their views. This applies even to the brightest because, as I said, wisdom can come only with the experience of living. And that takes time. No amount of college lectures or prattling textbooks can  substitute for the real thing. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never get mugged out of a textbook; and no left-wing lecture can ever make you understand the feeling of having a knife at your throat. One five-minute experience like those imparts more &#8220;education&#8221; than eight years of college or ten thousand classroom credits.</p>
<p>Ditto for a couple of years on an assembly line or riding the bus to work in the ghetto. We need to recapture what makes certain things and ideas popular among youth. They are so immature, gullible and easily led astray by pied pipers who falsely promise them a better world!  We need to control the pied pipers who control our youth.</p>

		<p>   I remember a television interview during the Rodney King riots, where a black woman was asked by a foreign correspondent: &#8220;why do blacks riot.&rdquo; Her answer has always stuck with me. She said, yes, black&rsquo;s riot but white people discriminate. I guess the two were morally equivalent in her mind, as well as in the minds of many liberals.</p>

		<p>Blacks as a group, conrary to their individual traits, are remarkably easy to conrol.  For complex reasons a relative few very smart liberals, looking a a very big picture, tacitly set out to use use this seemingly unwieldy club in the ruins of a post WWII world.  An equally easy to control group are far-left and mainsream liberals who who became the hand on this club.<br>
Conservatives of course need to wonder who is conrolling them, but need to address immediate concern.<br>

<p>Yes, me not wanting to hire a black person or live around them or give them money or invite them into my family is the exact same as killing others and destroying their property.</p>

		<p>Blacks have many more serious problems than an occasional police excess.  Living in their dangerous neighborhoods they should feel a surve of relief at the sight of a police uniform, or a police car.  </p>

		<p>They should throw those anarchist&rsquo;s young white rearends into the general Black prison population and teach them how diversity works in the real world as opposed to the make-believe world their affluent White parents brought them up in.  As to the looters, I remember a scene during the Rodney King riots.  Some Asian store owners were standing on the roof of their business with rifles in hand.  I thought to myself then, there&rsquo;s an immigrant I can get behind!  I don&rsquo;t remember any Whites rioting and looting when O.J. got away with murder. </p>
