<h1><a href="http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/07/09/113422.html">France Denies Citizenship to Muslim Man</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Agence France-Presse, July 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Moroccan man who refused to shake hands with a French female official and whose wife wears the full Islamic veil has been denied French citizenship, the immigration ministry said Friday.</p>
<p>The man, who has been living in France since 1999 and married a French woman in 2004, failed to &#8220;assimilate into French society&#8221; and displayed a &#8220;discriminatory attitude toward women,&#8221; said the ministry.</p>
<p>He &#8220;refused to shake the hand of a female official whom he met at the state prefecture because it was &#8216;against his religion&rsquo;&#8221;, said a statement.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s wife wore the full veil and only agreed to uncover herself in a room where no men would be present, the statement added.</p>
<p>The decision was announced a few days before the National Assembly is to vote on a bill banning the full-face Islamic veil as part of what the government has described as an effort to assert French values.<br>

		<p>This is not enough. Why do we want these genetically alien people to integrate? Our aim should be to kick all non-Whites including their White romantic partners, their half White children and the White liberals out of Europe irrespective if they embrace European culture or not. There is not moral reason in the world which can deny us wanting our grandchildren looking and behaving just like us. </p>

		<p>Just remember, Sarkozy backs the integration of Islam and Europe.</p>
<p>According to his words, Sarkozy would welcome that man into France if he&rsquo;d put on a little show of deceit for the state bureaucracy.</p>

		<p>If you tell your child that you will only feed him if he learns to fly, then you are both an imbecile and a child abuser.  The French allowed the muslim into the country and promised him citizenship based on the fantasy that he could turn himself into a Frenchman.  I don&rsquo;t see much of a difference in the two cases.  Don&rsquo;t blame the muslim.  The biggest threat the all White societies are marxist Whites, not non Whites.</p>

		<p>Then why don&rsquo;t they deport ALL muslims? Did not Sarkozy say that the French people need to race nix with the blacks etc and intermarry?</p>

		<p>Is this man&rsquo;s wife truly French, or is she a North African who acquired French citizenship? Also, does he have any children with his wife, and if so, have they been granted citizenship?  I&rsquo;d like to see him interviewed, as to why he wants citizenship in a country with cultural values so counter to his own. </p>

<p>Kat brought up  a very  good  point   &mdash;   one that I missed.  She raised the question as to whether his &#8220;French&#8221; wife is really French. Yes,  in our complicated new world of Diversity,  there are two kinds of &#8220;French&#8221; nowadays:  those who are ethnically and ancestrally French &hellip;. and those who are in possession of French passports. It&rsquo;s the same  thing in Britain too.  And Sweden, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>And what is meant by an &#8220;American&#8221; these days?  At one time   &mdash;   say at the time Madam Butterfly was written (that&rsquo;s a good example)   &mdash;   it was clearly understood what an American was; an American was a definite type of person.  Now, an &#8220;American&#8221; can be anyone or anything from anywhere. That concept has been demolished by the &#8220;creedal nation&#8221; gang who want to eliminate any connection of blood and soil with citizenship.  They&rsquo;re reducing nationality down to little more than a matter of  ZIP code. </p>
<p>On a plane from Paris to the USA, a couple of years ago, there was aboard a large group of &#8220;French&#8221; university students (as I guessed by their ages)&hellip;these were young adults,   maybe a hundred.  A more motley and unattractive assortment you never saw. This was Young France!   Marianne would be embarassed.  They came in all colors and looks.  Perhaps not more than 3 or 4 would you ever have taken for French.  </p>
<p>(Of course, the same could be said of a group of young  &#8220;Americans&#8221; from Detroit or Baltimore.  Foreigners would gape at them and wonder &hellip;&#8221;These are Americans???&#8221;)</p>
<p>Speaking of that, let me go off track a bit and mention another incident. This time  (heading to Europe) there was a group of teenage American girls from  a private girls&rsquo; school in Florida, near Tampa.  (I asked; and one could tell by their jackets and luggage markers.)   They were watched over by  older women chaperones.  I don&rsquo;t recall now if this was a religious school, but a  significant number of black girls  were among them.  I assume these black girls were on  some kind of scholarships,   because how many black teenagers can afford to fly to Rome for their Easter vacation? And how many black teenagers  would even have the interest?   What I couldn&rsquo;t help noticing was that they were seated in groups of twos or threes,  And these groups were all carefully integrated: each couple or trio with its black girl.    This didn&rsquo;t seem normal. There were no black girls sitting with other black girls!  This  simply is not the way kids will team up if left to their own choices. Btw, the chaperones were all white, as I recall.</p>
<p>Yes, a great deal of effort is being expended to break down all notions of race.  It&rsquo;s the obsession of our age, at least in all white countries (but only white ones).  But I suspect it is a losing battle, as ethnicity is a inborn instinct. People naturally cling to their own.   And seating black birls with white girls will never make them white.   Nor will  handing out passports to non-Europeans ever make them &#8220;French&#8221;.</p>
