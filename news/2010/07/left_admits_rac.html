<h1>Left Admits: Racism Charges Against Tea Parties a Tactic, Not a Truth</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, National Center for Public Policy Research, July 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For Release: July 29, 2010<br>
Contact: David Almasi at (202) 543-4110 x11<br>
or (703) 568-4727 or project21@nationalcenter.org<br>
or Judy Kent at (703) 759-7476<br>
or jkent@nationalcenter.org</p>
<p>Members of the Project 21 black leadership group are condemning the left&rsquo;s false use of the accusation &#8220;racist&#8221; as a political tactic, saying they recognize the strategy from the teaching of left-wing organizer Saul Alinsky.</p>
<p>Former U.S. Commission on Civil Rights Chairman Mary Frances Berry, a long-time prominent liberal activist, has admitted in an interview with Politico that the left is trying to smear the tea party movement as &#8220;racist&#8221; for strategic reasons, not out of genuine concern that the movement is itself racist.</p>
<p>Berry called the tactic an &#8220;effective strategy&#8221; and chose not to denounce it.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an active participant in the tea party movement, I know the movement&rsquo;s motivation is about Obama&rsquo;s policies and not his race,&#8221; said Deneen Borelli, a Project 21 full-time fellow who has spoken at many tea party rallies and is scheduled to speak at the &#8220;Uni-Tea&#8221; rally in Philadelphia on July 31. &#8220;Race card politics is the last-ditch effort to shift the debate away from President Obama&rsquo;s harmful policies such as the government&rsquo;s takeover of health care and his failure to create jobs  &mdash;  both of which are having an impact on his popularity. This diversion may also help Obama to try to jam through cap-and-trade legislation through Congress. It&rsquo;s a grand distraction from policies and may unfortunately increase racial tensions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berry, now the Geraldine R. Segal Professor of American Social Thought and History at the University of Pennsylvania, was asked, &#8220;will branding the tea party &#8216;racist&rsquo; work?&#8221;</p>
<p>Berry replied:<blockquote>Tainting the tea party movement with the charge of racism is proving to be an effective strategy for Democrats. There is no evidence that tea party adherents are any more racist than other Republicans, and indeed many other Americans. But getting them to spend their time purging their ranks and having candidates distance themselves should help Democrats win in November. Having one&rsquo;s opponent rebut charges of racism is far better than discussing joblessness.<br>
</blockquote>&#8220;This is exactly the kind of thing that has irked me all of my adult life, to put it mildly,&#8221; said Project 21 member R. Dozier Gray. &#8220;This willful and purposeful use of the race card for nothing more than political gain is toxic to race relations, and Mary Frances Berry must know that. But she evidently does not care. Based on her comment, political posturing takes primacy over whatever real issues regarding race that she might pretend are her calling cards. I have seen this all before. I find it shameful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Project 21 member Bob Parks added: &#8220;What&rsquo;s most disturbing about this very public quote? Not only is Mary Frances Berry making this comment without fear of admonishment, and that progressives have apparently embraced and are employing these very shameful, race-baiting tactics  &mdash;  but Berry is likely teaching this &#8216;social thought&rsquo; hate to children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Left-wing organizer Saul Alinsky, whose tactics have been studied and followed by Barack Obama and his followers, taught his activists to &#8220;Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.&#8221; The Tea Party movement has unnerved the left and energized supporters of smaller government, causing the left to target it, as per Alinsky&rsquo;s method, with bogus racism charges.</p>

		<p>Ironically, it&rsquo;s taking blacks to give what should have been Andrew Breitbart&rsquo;s response to the NAACP cabal.  And how strange that Bob Parks is closer to James Edwards than Breitbart.</p>

		<p>The MSM, in their ivory towers, think the label of &#8220;racist&#8221; is so anathema that common people writhe in horror at the mention of it.  The truth is that most folks acknowledge racial feelings within themselves and are not at all bothered by the concept.</p>

Once a critical mass of White Humanity in America turns the corner and no longer will volunteer to their dispossession and will fight against their displacement from their own country, we will thrive.  Obama&rsquo;s race agenda is doing us all a favor.  If we were blacks, we would be praising him for being explicitly race conscious.  We need a White Anglo-Saxon leader in whom we can have as much pride as the blacks have in their 1/2 black leader.</p>

<p>Each outburst in isolation is a sort of Macaca moment, a brief news item; in their totality, they have now more or less cemented in the minds of most Americans that Obama and his appointees see race as a sort of wedge issue by which to further an agenda.<br>

		<p>Everything Saul Alinsky advocates is useless to anyone or any group who responds with charges of their own, especially if the Alinsky charges are fraudulent and the response truthful.  </p>
<p>For example, the most effective tactic the Tea Party can use to combat charges of racism by the NAACP is to quickly dismiss them as bogus, then give examples of black on white racism and specifically those committed by the NAACP and/or its adherents.</p>
<p>People on this site are fully aware that the amount of black on white racism, from bare statistics, is astounding.  Just citing Dept. of Justice figures over and over again would be very effective, then following with examples of black on white mob attacks.  Revealing lies of white racism by blacks and white stooges is easy to do and should be pointed out as well.</p>
<p>The climate in the Duke rape case could have been reversed with a constant harping on the fact that 37,500 black on white rapes occur every year on average, but there are almost zero white on black rapes.  Specific cases could be cited.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s psychological warfare played tit for tat, revealing other black racist cases involving other races besides whites also.  Blacks commit horrendous racial violence against Asians and mestizos as well.</p>
<p>The reason whitey is constantly on the defensive is because he&rsquo;s either afraid to fight on the same terms or he&rsquo;s not bright enough to understand the stark hypocrisy of charges by non-whites, especially those from blacks and mentally disturbed leftist whites.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s examine the mestizo situation where they&rsquo;re calling whites racist for wanting to protect their borders.  Does anyone think the tables could not be turned immediately if talk show hosts and others started revealing vicious anti-white hatred from the likes of established mestizos who have confirmed quotes like Prof. Guiteriz of Texas Univ. who said, in effect, mestizos must get rid of the Gringo any way possible and that would include killing them as a last resort?  There&rsquo;s a wealth of similar quotes from established people in both the black and mestizo community, and there are recent actions and quotes that could be brought forth, which are no more than anti-white racist hatred.</p>
<p>Too, does anybody think revealing that mestizos are complaining about wanting their tribal kin to be given amnesty for no reason other than they want their own kind to dominate and most want to take over a large portion of the US, would not be effective with whites?  Just as effective as highlighting the racism by the Black Panthers who were screaming about killing all the whites and especially their babies.  Just as effective as playing video tapes non-stop of Jeremiah Wright and his congregation applauding racist statements against whites that are not only lies, but they&rsquo;re completely uncalled for, since blacks can&rsquo;t succeed due to a lack of intelligence, not white racism or oppression.</p>
<p>This is my big problem with white establishment politicians.  They think of themselves as managers who are there to keep the peace, while non-white leaders very vigorously use the race card and cause these same cowardly whites to back down with hardly a wimper, and, at the same time, garner many benefits for their minions.</p>
<p>The saddest part of the entire reluctance by whites to point out non-white racism and violence is that most ALL the non-white charges of racism, oppresion and the like are a pack of lies, while the non-white on white situations and events are factual.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the situation we are in today:  The NAACP levelled proven bogus race charges against the Tea Party, which left whites stuttering around trying to explain away the charges with concessions and boot-licking instead of dismissing the allegations as bogus and responding with VALID racism charges of their own. </p>
<p>Any white who will allow a nit-wit like Saul Alinsky to dominate the war of the races and culture deserves exactly what he gets, especially when his idiotic brand of propaganda is really relatively easy to negate and place its advocates on the defensive.</p>
<p>If we are to regroup as a unified, homogeneous nation after the onslaught of this economic tragedy is behind us, anybody who refuses to cull our ranks of blithering fools should be banned right along with them.</p>

		<p>While there is, no doubt, a portion of the political left that wields the &#8220;racism&#8221; tag purely as a weapon, it would be foolish to contend that many, perhaps even most on the left really do see traditional, white America(as embodied in the Tea Party types)as lousy with bigotries galore!! Those who argue against Illegal aliens/amnesty, universal healthcare, the broader welfare state, affirmative action/quotas, etc., are all, by any leftwing definition, hoplessly &#8220;racist&#8221; in nature.    </p>

<p>This is why, I am not so concerned with telling the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; anymore, but simply inflaming other whites toward the idea that these Reds are out to exterminate us/them!</p>
<p>Oh wait, I am telling the truth: silly me!!!</p>
<p>Look, we have a lot of work to do, but currently half of it is being done by our worst enemies also. Saul Alinsky, indeed and by &ldquo;creed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For now our goals must be threefold:</p>
<p>1.) Making the words &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and &ldquo;bigotry&rdquo; synonymous with stupidity and moral weakness, in political discourse;</p>
<p>2.) Making the words Marxism and multiculturalism, their replacements;</p>
<p>3.) And finally, never backing down from the tangible goal of making the USA 88% white again, or greater.</p>
<p>We can do it, By God!!!</p>

		<p>Read the comments on this article and I will wager most Whites will never wake up to their own racial genocide!  I will also wager that these are the &#8220;Tea Party&#8221; types. They are throwing black after black speaker out there in hopes they won&rsquo;t be called &#8220;racists&#8221; any longer. In effect, they are dooming us all to their childish notions about race. They have all ganged up on a poster named &#8220;westvalley&#8221;&hellip;</p>

		<p>Strange how the term &#8220;racist&#8221; has become the ultimate pejorative. To believe that there are distinct differences between races (to believe one&rsquo;s own eyes and ears) is to commit the most egregious of thought crimes.</p>
<p>All discussion of differences between the races is thus totally forbidden, lest the patently obvious be revealed.  I can think of no other issue, even in the old USSR, which murdered some forty million of its own citizens for failure to accept Marxist orthodoxy, where a truth so utterly self-evident must be almost hysterically denied, with heretics literally risking their fortunes and freedoms.</p>
<p>There will be a terrible reckoning when our nation finally comes apart.</p>

		<p>Whites have legitimate concerns about black social pathology, especially black crime.  The more the left used the term &#8220;racist,&#8221; the less effective it will be.  <br>

When called a racist, one should ask, &#8220;What did I say that is not true?&#8221; </p>

		<p> That tactic is working. Look at the upcoming Tea Party convention in Philadelphia.  The black speakers at that event are disproportionately (is that a long word or what?) high to their membership. The tea party is useless. A lot of people say liberals throw the race card around so much that the word is losing it&rsquo;s power. I don&rsquo;t think so. Once again, look at the upcoming convention.</p>

<p>I believe White politicians are fully aware of the hypocrisy of non-White charges. But they also know their opponents are fierce, well-funded, relentless and have access to the media.  The opposition believes in the politics of personal destruction and will spend inordinate amounts of time and money turning over their target&rsquo;s life looking for dirt, or mounting specious false charges, claiming he is a closet Nazi or racist which the lefty media happily picks up and trumpets across the nation via CNN and the NYT.</p>
<p>They also know their opponents are happy to bankroll their opponent and the target may well find his funding suddenly drying up, his donors hiding  &mdash;  they well know what is coming.</p>
<p>It works, and works well.</p>
<p>Alex Kurtagic writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Case in point is Michael Sheridan&rsquo;s recent article in the New York Daily News, reporting on Ryan Murdough&rsquo;s Republican candidacy for a seat on the State House in New Hampshire. Murdough has been targeted because he is running on an explicitly pro-White platform, and has been endorsed by an explicitly pro-White political party&hellip;We know Sheridan&rsquo;s article in the New York Daily News, like the one in the Huffington Post, are about limiting Ryan Murdough&rsquo;s access to power&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The article in the NY Daily News prominently features a picture of the back of a bald man&rsquo;s head tattooed with a large swastika.  Many posters on the article&rsquo;s comment line believe the picture is of the &#8216;Nazi&rsquo; candidate himself (which it isn&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>Mr. Kurtagic continues:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;When faced with a damaging collection of false claims, the immediate urge is to rebut them at length&hellip;.. Coming from an unpopular faction, long rebuttals tend to be either be ignored or dismissed as excuses&hellip;when an attack is particularly outrageous it is not unlikely that it is intended as bait&hellip; The aim is to keep the target on the defensive, because this makes him look weak and in a state of panic.</p>
<p>The very structure of the attack  &mdash;  smear with bogus claims, ignore response, smear again with new bogus claims; then repeat the smears over and over again  &mdash;  shows that its purpose is not to disprove something, but to discredit someone&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurtagic goes on to explain that the only response to such an attack is an immediate counterattack   &mdash;   a personal attack aimed directly at the accuser, which is exactly the strategy the Alinsky crowd uses against its opponents (forget being nice or &#8216;above it all&rsquo; or &#8216;not stooping down to their level in the gutter&rsquo;;  our opponents believe in  no-holds barred, everything is on the table  &mdash;  a strategy that wins for them and that our side must employ as well  &mdash;  Lee Atwater was the last Republican strategist that understood and used this tactic  &mdash;   with great success.)</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;An effective response, therefore, needs to be mostly about attacking the attacker, not the attack itself. The attack itself can be ignored for the most part if the attacker can be successfully discredited.</p>
<p>It should also, ideally, introduce new information about the attacker. David Duke&rsquo;s confrontation with Wolf Blitzer&rsquo;s on CNN in December 2006 is a good example of how a lone dissident, representing an unpopular minority view, can turn the tables on the hostile mainstream media machine&hellip;He spent very little time responding to specific accusations&hellip;. Most importantly: the tired, old news about Duke&rsquo;s past was not as interesting as the unexpected revelation that Blitzer has an anti-Iran bias because he is a former Israel lobbyist&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right. Another line is &#8220;I gave you the facts, you gave me opinions (and or theories)&#8221;.</p>
<p>I have tried to use this tactic but the people in control still have the power to silence people like you and me. For example, I have focused on the script but I was still banned from  commenting on the Buffalo News comment page. My crime was posting government statistics, local police reports, and &#8216;most wanted&rsquo; listings among other things.</p>
<p>Apparently being well informed and knowledgeable classifies you as a &#8216;racist&rsquo;. </p>

		<p> No great surprises here. &#8220;Racist&#8221; has become the all-purpose Leftist &#8220;hate word&#8221; in our society; it is intended to scare its target into either silence, or the abasement of denial of any &#8220;racist&#8221; intentions, and to stop debate dead in its tracks.</p>
<p> It&rsquo;s good to hear that the this black conservative organization is not afraid to point this out, publicly. Now if only the Republican Party, and some national spokesman for the Tea Party Movement, would do the same. Tell the Left, &#8220;You&rsquo;re yelling &#8216;racist&rsquo; to try to shut us up, but it&rsquo;s not going to work. Come up with some other rebuttal, because that one&rsquo;s been used to death!&#8221;</p>

<p>Right you are; however, that doesn&rsquo;t negate the effectiveness of the promotion of a good, vicious counter attack.  But it has to be done intelligently, as a discussion and not as a blatant counter charge of racism.</p>
<p>Acting just as outraged in response to charges against whites by blacks, whites have to respond with racist/bias charges that are factual.  It&rsquo;s a ploy that is not used enough by white elitists.  This method was used by conservative people in the black panther incident, wherein one of them was screaming to kill white children.  But it ended only as an isolated incident rather than an indication of anti-white hatred imbeded in the black community.</p>
<p>The Jeremiah Wright tapes was a similar incident, although it came out as no more than a report that could not be disputed as having news merit, and it was just that.  But there were no follow up discussions about why the congregation was cheering such obvious anti-white hate, etc.  In other words, it was &#8220;safe&#8221; to point out these incidents, because they were such an obvious overt threat to whites, making them above reproach for being reported as newsworthy items, but much more discussion regarding black racism should have been done to place the entire black community on the defensive, just as the left does to whites.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m advocating is elaborating further, as the left does, on bringing up black racist incidents that are pertinent in response to charges against whites, innocently asking, in response, concerned questions as to how we can negate these kinds of anti-white racist attacks by those espousing them.  </p>
<p>They could also be used in response to charges of white racism by the NAACP, for example, innocently asking the question, &#8220;Why doesn&rsquo;t the NAACP openly condemn such attacks in order to reduce or eliminate the number of them for the purpose of racial healing?&#8221; </p>
<p>Take black on white mob attacks.  Constantly elaborating on them for their value as being newsworthy can be effectively heavily criticized by leftist radicals and blacks; however, there are intelligent ways to handle the matter differently that are beyond any legitimate criticism.</p>
<p>For example, after reporting on a black on white mob attack, dialogue chould be initiated as to what could be done to prevent future incidents, during which the audience can&rsquo;t avoid learning that there is indeed anti-white racism rife within the black community.  Basically, that&rsquo;s the type of psychological warfare the left uses all the time.  Just as in the Shirley Sherrod case.  Entire shows were dedicated to discussing what the left twisted to be false charges, even though her mindset was obviously anti-white, revealed by her assessment that a white explaining a situatiuon to a black was &#8220;talking down&#8221; to her, when all he was doing was probably trying to explain himself, but her inept ability to comprend regarded it all as racist superiority.  It was blatant racism on her part, as were the cheers from the NAACP audience.  But because of the way it was presented by the left, she is a victim who is suing Breitbart.  </p>
<p>Keep in mind the leftist white and black dregs are going to scream racism if anyone simply opposes revealing racist actions.  The war has to be fought as a psychological one that minimizes the left&rsquo;s effective use of methods that are aimed at personal destruction.  Whites refusing to do that can&rsquo;t even be called cowards, because there&rsquo;s really no danger to one&rsquo;s career to want to bring about racial healing.  I think they don&rsquo;t do so, because most of them snobbishly think they are above that sort of warfare. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if conservative whites will ever learn that they will never win trying to be managers instead of soldiers.  All they succeed in doing is protecting their valuable careers.  And, maybe that&rsquo;s what is most important to them anyway.</p>
<p>But I know one thing for certain:  We will surely go to war if we remain on the same track.  It&rsquo;s absolutely unavoidable.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Right you are; however, that doesn&rsquo;t negate the effectiveness of the promotion of a good, vicious counter attack. But it has to be done intelligently, as a discussion and not as a blatant counter charge of racism&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>We are on the same page and this is why I&rsquo;ve been writing on here recently:  </p>
<p>&#8220;Accusations of racism are best met, not with denials or explanations, but with a ruthless counter-attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks and hispanics with sub 100 IQs are not capable of intelligent discussion.  You will lose them immediately.  This is why  brain-washing and White-hating slogans work so well on them, as the Saul Alinsky crowd well knows.</p>
<p>They are easy to dispatch with a strongly stated affirmation, repeated as necessary, short and to the point.  But be ever careful around blacks:  They are more than likely to answer you with a punch to the face  &mdash;  their idea of winning a debate.</p>
<p>For blacks:</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me one example of White privilege&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who ended slavery?&#8221;</p>
<p>For hispanics:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mexico fought and lost a war, signed a treaty and was paid money for the Southwest&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give up your White created things if you hate us so much  &mdash;   starting with your TV, cell phone and computer.&#8221;</p>
<p>But blacks and hispanics are not our main target, they are nothing but easily expendable, useful idiots doing their masters&rsquo; bidding to destroy and displace Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>The White-hating hostile elite is where our efforts need to be concentrated, where we need to direct our counter attacks.  They are the ones who need to be taken out because they are taking us out.</p>
<p>We would be well-advised to study the tactics in &#8216;Rules for Radicals&rsquo;, The Bible the hostile elite uses against us:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Hilary Clinton called her 92-page work,  &#8216;There Is Only the Fight &hellip; &#8216;: An Analysis of the Alinsky Model.&rsquo; &#8220;I basically argued that [Alinsky] was right,&#8221; Clinton told The Washington Post in 1993&hellip; Obama arrived in Chicago in 1985 to work with the Developing Communities Project, an offshoot of the Alinsky network&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right. Another line is &ldquo;I gave you the facts, you gave me opinions (and or theories)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I have tried to use this tactic but the people in control still have the power to silence people like you and me. For example, I have focused on the script but I was still banned from commenting on the Buffalo News comment page. My crime was posting government statistics, local police reports, and &lsquo;most wanted&rsquo; listings among other things.</p>
<p>Apparently being well informed and knowledgeable classifies you as a &lsquo;racist&rsquo;. <br>

That can&rsquo;t last much longer.  It has been nearly two generations since the civil rights legislation was signed.  It is getting harder to keep blaming black social pathology on &#8220;white racism.&#8221;  This is particularly true since black social pathology got worse after the legislation was signed. <br>
 <br>
Whites are growing tired of lying in public, while whispering the truth behind locked doors, fastened windows, and closed blinds.   </p>

		<p>Once whites stop reacting to accusations of racism like vampires react to sunlight the communists will stop using the word.</p>
<p>Pretend they are accusing you of bestiality instead and don&rsquo;t even respond with an answer.  </p>
<p>Just silently stand your ground and don&rsquo;t let them draw you into their space&hellip; </p>
