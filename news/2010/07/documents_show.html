			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Strong, Daily Caller, July 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} In the heat of the presidential campaign, videos surfaced of Obama&rsquo;s pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, angrily denouncing whites, the U.S. government and America itself. {snip}</p>
<p>The crisis reached a howling pitch in mid-April, 2008, at an ABC News debate moderated by Charlie Gibson and George Stephanopoulos. Gibson asked Obama why it had taken him so long  &mdash;  nearly a year since Wright&rsquo;s remarks became public  &mdash;  to dissociate himself from them. Stephanopoulos asked, &#8220;Do you think Reverend Wright loves America as much as you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}According to records obtained by The Daily Caller, at several points during the 2008 presidential campaign a group of liberal journalists took radical steps to protect their favored candidate. Employees of news organizations including Time, Politico, the Huffington Post, the Baltimore Sun, the Guardian, Salon and the New Republic participated in outpourings of anger over how Obama had been treated in the media, and in some cases plotted to fix the damage.</p>
<p>In one instance, Spencer Ackerman of the Washington Independent urged his colleagues to deflect attention from Obama&rsquo;s relationship with Wright by changing the subject. Pick one of Obama&rsquo;s conservative critics, Ackerman wrote, &#8220;Fred Barnes, Karl Rove, who cares  &mdash;  and call them racists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michael Tomasky, a writer for the Guardian, also tried to rally his fellow members of Journolist [Journolist is a listserv made up of several hundred liberal journalists, as well as like-minded professors and activists]: &#8220;Listen folks  &mdash;  in my opinion, we all have to do what we can to kill ABC and this idiocy in whatever venues we have. This isn&rsquo;t about defending Obama. This is about how the [mainstream media] kills any chance of discourse that actually serves the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Richard Kim got this right above: &#8216;a horrible glimpse of general election press strategy.&rsquo; He&rsquo;s dead on,&#8221; Tomasky continued. &#8220;We need to throw chairs now, try as hard as we can to get the call next time. Otherwise the questions in October will be exactly like this. This is just a disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>(In an interview Monday, Tomasky defended his position, calling the ABC debate an example of shoddy journalism.)</p>
<p>Thomas Schaller, a columnist for the Baltimore Sun as well as a political science professor, upped the ante from there. In a post with the subject header, &#8220;why don&rsquo;t we use the power of this list to do something about the debate?&#8221; Schaller proposed coordinating a &#8220;smart statement expressing disgust&#8221; at the questions Gibson and Stephanopoulos had posed to Obama.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The members began collaborating on their open letter. Jonathan Stein of Mother Jones rejected an early draft, saying, &#8220;I&rsquo;d say too short. In my opinion, it doesn&rsquo;t go far enough in highlighting the inanity of some of [Gibson&rsquo;s] and [Stephanopoulos&rsquo;s] questions. And it doesn&rsquo;t point out their factual inaccuracies.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Our friends at Media Matters probably have tons of experience with this sort of thing, if we want their input.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Notice this happened in mid-April 2008, before Obama had technically won the nomination.  This should be an object lesson to people named McCain and Clinton, especially McCain   &mdash;   The media made you, and then they broke you.  Best to make yourself in a fashion that doesn&rsquo;t require the ruling class&rsquo;s propaganda arms.</p>

		<p>If Obama&rsquo;s presidency turns out as bad as I&rsquo;m afraid it will,I wonder if the news media will admit their mistake? I doubt it, but just maybe some of the whites will wake up. Perhaps some of the whites will realize that the news media is working full time to promote Obama.</p>

		<p>Most Americans get their information from a small group of very wealthy media conglomerates that have an agenda.  What is presented to the public by NPR, Newsweek, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and a thousand other outlets is not the truth.  They lie in various ways, but primarily by simple omission   &mdash;   not reporting on events that goes against their agenda. </p>
<p>That is part of the reason they want to establish hate-speech laws and control over the Internet.  They want control over what people hear, learn, and discuss.</p>

<p>Well, how surprising this is, I never would have guessed that this could be true!</p>
<p>In the end, we must always remember that the nanosecond you are called a &ldquo;racist,&rdquo; your immediate response must be to accuse your attacker as being a genocidal and multicultural psychopath, who is out to exterminate the white race. Demand definitions of &ldquo;racism&rdquo; from them and no matter what answer they give, twist and reverse it so that they are exemplifying their own answer, as it applies to whites in their own words. </p>
<p>For example: Comrade X states, &lsquo;it is racist to not want unlimited immigration or expect these imaginary things called borders to be respected, because all human beings have the right to live and work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The response from any human worthy of the name, should be: &lsquo;You are demanding that unlimited invasions of our sovereign country must be tolerated and encouraged, because not to do so is &ldquo;racist?&rdquo; Yet, when we let these people in, even in limited numbers, they prove themselves incompatible with our civilization and established population&rsquo;s norms. They are encouraged by traitors like yourself to not only remain alien, but to do so belligerently. What is your game Comrade X, helping these invaders to find better lives or encouraging them to hate whites and destroy them? All of your actions indicate the latter and that you are in fact a racist who wants to exterminate the entire white race via territorial conquests and demographic displacements by Third World interlopers and the homegrown nonwhites that already are here&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Get my drift?</p>

		<p> To say I&rsquo;m &#8220;not surprised&#8221; would be the understatement of the year. Say, guess what, all those &#8220;paranoid&#8221; things that Fox News has been saying about the &#8220;mainstream media&#8221; being in love with Obama, are TRUE! And we thought Fox was just &#8220;eat up&#8221; with right-wing hatred and &#8220;racism&#8221;!</p>
<p> I&rsquo;ll bet a number of movers and shakers on the Left choked on their chablis and brie when they saw this article. Here, before God and everyone, is proof that they had their thumb heavily on the journalistic scales, while thrills ran up their legs, two years ago, rooting the Mulatto Messiah home. Their attempts to deny it will still be voiced, of course, but they&rsquo;ll sound as hollow as Joe Biden&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p> One more observation, this on the interview by Gibson and Stephanopoulos: The latter&rsquo;s question of Obama, &#8220;Do you think Rev. Wright loves America as much as you do?&#8221;, was an incredible softball. Mainly because, it pre-supposed that Barack Obama loves America. The question should have been, &#8220;Do you think Rev. Wright hates America?&#8221; Looks like George just couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to confront the Anointed One that baldly.</p>

The goal is to get to the point where you can contrast some _thing_  &mdash;  Obama&rsquo;s substantive agenda  &mdash;  with this crap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Kevin Drum, then of Washington Monthly, also disagreed with Ackerman&rsquo;s strategy. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind that Obama is trying (or says he&rsquo;s trying) to run a campaign that avoids precisely the kind of thing Spencer is talking about, and turning this into a gutter brawl would probably hurt the Obama brand pretty strongly. After all, why vote for him if it turns out he&rsquo;s not going change the way politics works?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was Ackerman who had the last word. &ldquo;Kevin, I&rsquo;m not saying OBAMA should do this. I&rsquo;m saying WE should do this.&rdquo;<br>

It figures that these folks would wait until the last sentence to start backpedaling in a snide, sniveling, self-defensive mindset while actually -coming close- to the real reason what they did in 2008 was such a crime.</p>
<p>1.  Liberals have been so wrong about so many things for so long that, like blacks, they trump sense with passion and just &#8216;do it to them because they&rsquo;ve done it to us and we deserve to be winners.  Don&rsquo;t We?&rsquo;</p>
<p>2.  It never once occurred to ANY of these idiots to ask their little voice: &#8220;Is it true?&#8221;  Is the reason we know so little of substance about Obama&rsquo;s background, beliefs, political achievements and stance.  The simple fact that he has none?  And if he has none (beyond Chicago Politics and &#8216;Community Advocacy&rsquo;) what experience base is he in fact operating from?  </p>
<p>If Obama&rsquo;s vision of the world was shaped by this man for all these years and his vision of a new form of government is uni-party privilege and payola as institutionalized corruption, then there is something _seriously_ wrong with the Press who are so psychologically traumatized by the thought of backing another rabid radical with slimy business morals as would prefer to focus on their -interpretation- of the &#8216;ugliness of the question&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Rather than the actuality of it&rsquo;s truth or falseity in terms of framing President Obama as a real person with real background and not some symbolic saint.</p>

		<p>This really isn&rsquo;t a surprise.  But it is a pleasant confirmation of what was quite obvious.  This would explain why liberal news outlets almost always use the exact same wording in their political spins.   It really is a coordinated effort. </p>
<p>And after reading this, no white man should ever take a charge of racism seriously again.  The word is used exactly they way I use the words &#8220;sit&#8221; and &#8220;stay&#8221; with my dogs.   It&rsquo;s an command word with an ingrained response.  For 40 years, whites have been trained to fear having that word thrown at them.  Now it&rsquo;s used casually just to get white men to shut up and get out of the way at the slightest hint of self-culpability in a black or a liberal. </p>

		<p>The MSM has, for several decades, been a left-wing cabal that has systematically excluded people without impeccable left-wing credentials.  To have any hope of graduating from any journalism school in this country you&rsquo;d better highlight your liberal bias or be very good at concealing any conservative inclinations.</p>
<p>Of course, a J-school degree hardly makes one a competent or qualified journalist. There was no such thing half a century ago, and today no conservative-leaning pundit is a graduate of J-school, and all the really serious thinkers and polished writers are on the conservative side.</p>
<p>And these dolts wonder why they&rsquo;re losing market share, while Fox News and the WSJ make money and the risible New York Times and practically all the rest of the big metro dailies are awash in red ink and now whining for government subsidies.  Of course, that would ensure absolute objectivity.</p>

		<p>It became obvious to me during the campaign that Obama was the designated winner to be and the MSM was conspiring to sell him to the public. Here was a person with no real record of accomplishing anything whatsoever, apart from what affirmative action bestowed on him, who was being groomed for the presidency. The MSM colluded, in my view, to squelch any news story that might negatively impact his momentum. He was sellable and came complete with an already existing autobiography, which I&rsquo;ve always found rather strange. How many men in their early 30&rsquo;s, with no history of doing anything significant or unusual, write autobiographies? That&rsquo;s usually done later in life after someone has made their mark in some field or has become well known. But an unknown with no achievements? A concocted brand name that was sold to the public is what he really is.    </p>

		<p>Of course it was a coordinated effort.  They pulled all kinds of stunts like this, and even went to court to block Dennis Kucinich from the televised debates because he would have taken votes from Obama.</p>
<p>The media has huge power, but web sites like this one are eroding that power.  In 2005 a NY Times poll found that only 12% of respondents had &#8220;high confidence&#8221; in the reliability of the news they were getting.</p>

<p>We all know the mainstream media is OWNED by people that want to genocide the White race, and create instead a mulatto class to fight amongst the many, many other squabbling minorities.</p>
<p>This is why black-on-White crime is hushed and all the data pointing to racial differences is taboo.  </p>
<p>Elites that own the media look at places like Brazil or Columbia (non-White majority) and they just drool over it.  Dumbed-down population = easily corrupted politicians.  Hell, they can just assassinate political opponents like they do in Mexico.</p>
<p>White Man, the mainstream media is not going to help you.  You can only subvert it for your own cause.</p>
<p>COMMENT AND POST RACIALLY-AWARE STATEMENTS.  The Sheeple are moved by &#8220;popular opinion.&#8221;  It is extremely difficult to HIDE OBVIOUS TRUTH  &mdash;   just ask the Soviet Union.  </p>

<p>Splendid response!  Play their own game against them, but play it even better. Don&rsquo;t back down (as you&rsquo;re supposed to do); they assume you&rsquo;ve been conditioned for that.

		<p>Although the liberal MSM did everything in their power to get Obama elected, the American people knew full well about the racial hatred and anti-Americanism of Jeremiah Wright and Michelle Obama, for starters.  White voters are the ones to blame for our present President!  Only 44% of white votes cast were for Obama, but what about the large percentage of whites who didn&rsquo;t vote at all?  People knew the blacks would be out with bells on to cast ballots for Barack, but many whites sat home.  Were they just too despondent to stir or what?  <br>
The next time, we had BETTER make a difference!  </p>

		<p>Well,well,well it seems that the Obama supporters in the media are afraid of the truth.  I always thought the truth shall set us free.  In the age of the Internet with sites like Amren the truth is going to be much more difficult to suppress. Maybe because the truth is more difficult to cover up is the reason why the Obama administration is trying to have the Internet regulated. FREE AT LAST, FREE AT LAST THANK GOD ALMIGHTY WE ARE FREE AT LAST.  Yes, the truth really will set us free. Pravda would be envious of the United States ahh free press.</p>

		<p>The truly egregious media suppression has been the continuing coverup and stonewalling of the lack of a paper trail from the current president.</p>
<p>Barack Obama repeated promised during his 2008 campaign that his administration would be the most transparent in history, and that he would bring greater truth and accountability to the executive branch of government.</p>
<p>Virtually the entire paper trail of the current president&rsquo;s existence has never been released or allowed to be subjected to any sort of scrutiny, despite several years of repeated requests by numerous individuals and media organizations.  His original typewritten long form birth certificate is locked away in a state government vault in Hawaii.  The Obama 2008 campaign did release a computer generated short form version of a birth certificate that a child could have forged, but this only made matters worse for them, intensifying the demand the see the original typewritten long form document.  His school records, SAT and LSAT scores, college and law school transcripts and term papers, medical records and passport history have all never been released or allowed to be subjected to any sort of scrutiny.  The Obama 2008 campaign and subsequent administration has to date spent in excess of two million dollars in legal fees to fight Freedom of Information Act filings and other requests to examine these documents.  What is being hidden and why are they hiding it?</p>

		<p>To ghw, regarding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;PS. They don&rsquo;t play fair, they play to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed they do!</p>
<p>That is why, no matter what their sanctimonious &ldquo;intentions,&rdquo; we should fight 100% plus 10% as dirty as they do. These Reds are our enemies, and not so much as an eighth, let alone a quarter, should ever be offered to them. That is unless we see an<br>
advantage, that allows us to put them in pen behind the quarters occupied by the pigs!</p>
<p>All the best to you ghw,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>
