	<p>Tatiana Reina wanted to graduate in the worst way  &mdash;  and she did. </p>
<p>The 21-year-old was enrolled at Lafayette HS in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, for six years with a dismal record marked by truancy and failing grades. She faked her own graduation in 2007, donning a cap and gown and sneaking into the receiving line. Faced with &#8220;aging out&#8221; of the school system this year, she got a last chance and still didn&rsquo;t bother going to class. </p>
<p>&#8220;She was a no-show all year,&#8221; a school insider said. Regulations call for at least 90 percent attendance to be promoted or to graduate. </p>
<p>But that didn&rsquo;t stop the principal, Jacqueline Boswell, from granting Reina a diploma. </p>
<p>In June, Reina showed up for the last five days and was given some health and chemistry assignments in the guidance office, school staffers said. &#8220;She sat at a computer and Googled her answers,&#8221; a worker said. </p>
<p>Finally, teachers were pressured into giving Reina  &mdash;  and a half-dozen other failing students  &mdash;  minimally passing grades of 65, the equivalent of a &#8220;D,&#8221; to get the credits needed to graduate, sources told The Post. </p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re giving out diplomas like it&rsquo;s a lemonade stand,&#8221; one disgusted staffer said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What happened at Lafayette HS, one of five city high schools that closed their doors for the last time last week, is not a fluke, critics say. </p>
<p>&#8220;This is happening all over the city, especially at closing schools,&#8221; said Leonie Haimson, executive director of Class Size Matters. &#8220;If you&rsquo;re a principal or a teacher and your chances of getting another job depend on how many kids you successfully graduate, the vast majority will give these kids credit, whether they deserve it not,&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reina first entered Lafayette in June 2004. Four years later, her credits fell short. But she bought a cap and gown and &#8220;snuck into the line&#8221; to walk on stage. A staffer noticed, but told the announcer to call out her name so as not to &#8220;make a scene.&#8221; Reina, like the others, was handed a piece of paper with instructions to pick up her diploma later. </p>
<p>Still enrolled at Lafayette in 2008, Reina flunked everything but Spanish, earning a single credit and then another in summer school, records show. She then enrolled in Borough of Manhattan Community College, a CUNY campus, but got kicked out when officials finally got her high-school transcript. </p>
<p>So she returned to Lafayette last year. On Jan. 12, a school day, she was arrested for buying goods at Bloomingdale&rsquo;s at Roosevelt Field, LI, with $400 in fake traveler&rsquo;s checks; the felony charge is pending. </p>
<p>She failed everything until the second term, when she snagged the last two required credits. </p>
<p>&#8220;I got my diploma!&#8221; she said last week, but didn&rsquo;t want to comment further. </p>
<p>Asked about her atrocious attendance, she explained, &#8220;There wasn&rsquo;t no problem. I just didn&rsquo;t go.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Although we must give Susan Edelman and Cynthia R. Fagen at least a nod of encouragement for writing this piece at all, I can&rsquo;t help noticing that there is not one word in it that mentions race.  This is affirmative action at its finest, yet the <i>Post</i> dares not openly mention the obvious.</p>
<p>We can at least pray that the editors were hoping their White readers would draw the self-evident conclusion.  These days, even being able to read between the lines is a sign of change.<br>

		<p>This reminded me of the argument here in NJ for competition among schools.  Who in heavens name could possibly teach kids like this young woman?  No one.  She isn&rsquo;t interested and never was.  Her mother wasn&rsquo;t interested in her education.  There is nothing the best teacher in the world could do for someone like this.  Nothing.  And when they talk about moving children from &#8220;failing&#8221; schools to successful schools all they mean is moving black and mestizo kids into decent suburban schools and destroying the white kids chance for an education.</p>
<p>When you combine children with a minimal ability to learn with parents that have no interest in their children achieving even minimal literacy there is no hope.  </p>

<p>Just showing up will earn a diploma.  But how will they know what is on it?  I mean, they can&rsquo;t read.  </p>
<p>And when they can&rsquo;t get a job that requires good reading and math skills they&rsquo;ll get a rent-a-mob together via Al or Jesse and scream discrimination.<br>

		<p>Lafayette High School is in Bensonhurst Brooklyn.  In days gone by Bensonhurst was predominantly Italian.  I know, I lived there.  Lafayette H.S. was the high school Sandy Koufax attended way back in the 1950&rsquo;s when there were still academic standards.  Today there are many Russians and Orientals there, so when I first saw the name &#8216;Tatiana&rsquo; I thought she was Russian, so I was a bit surprised that a Russian would still be in high school at the age of 21.  When I saw the photo though I realized what I should have realized at the start - she was Black.  This is another habit among Blacks - aside from failing in school - that is, to name their girl children exotic names, I guess in a collective attempt to feminize them and sophisticate them.  Incidentally, female Blacks have more testosterone than women of other races.  </p>
<p>This is just another example of the incredible actions of schools today in passing no-account truants and dead beats like this girl.</p>

		<p>This is only the beginning. Unless she has a slew of babies and goes on welfare, she is going to be a headache and a drag on the employment world for the next 45 years.  I&rsquo;ve seen types like this. Just as with getting her diploma, she&rsquo;ll expect to get paid without coming to work.  And the system is geared to sympathize with her!  I predict lots of EEO complaints, discrimination lawsuits, workman&rsquo;s comp cases, etc.  She&rsquo;ll be keeping the lawyers in business.  And, who knows?&hellip;she just may clean up if she hits the ghetto lottery.  She has a good chance of it. </p>

		<p>Once more, our fine public schools strike again. I guess that telling this woman that she was out of luck and to go get a GED would be racist. Why in Heaven&rsquo;s name is a 21 yo attending a high school? I realize that there were WWII veterans who dropped out of school and upon returning attended high school for a short time before college. At least most of these men were trying to improve themselves in an era before colleges offered remedial classes. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t totally blame this woman, she has figured out that abysmal school systems have some perverse incentives. If obtaining your next job depends on the number of students who graduate, what will most people do, start handing out diplomas like cracker jack prizes. </p>
<p>The comedian Rocky LaPorte had a great comment one time. While speaking about his time in school he said: &#8220;Hey Pops, I got a B in reading. That&rsquo;s a D, you idiot&#8221;. That sums up this school perfectly. </p>

<p>YES!  YES!  YES!  I teach in NYC.  Two different high schools.  This sort of thing happens ROUTINELY!</p>
<p>I am not kidding.  Every other black and Latino kid is handed credits and grades on a platter for almost no work at all.  Principals pressure teachers to do this at pain of losing their jobs.  I have seen teachers who stuck to their guns and graded fairly get railroaded out in a merciless way.</p>

Once you reached the age of 19, you were out the door, no matter what. Summer schoo&rsquo; if you failed to make up the work. NOW you can still attend [at least in NYC] when you are 21?</p>

		<p>This sort of travesty happens all over. Here in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, the graduation rate at Central High School has been boosted by allowing students to &#8220;retake&#8221; the parts of courses they failed. In other words, they don&rsquo;t retake failed courses, they are only retested on the parts of the exams they failed. Central is over 99% black and in recent years its graduation rate has fallen below 50%. A number of years ago we annually hosted exchange students from Europe and Brazil. These kids had to go to Central (at that time it was perhaps 40% white) and they really received an EDUCATION! Just to describe a few of the incidents: One of our student&rsquo;s lab partners was arrested for murder. Another witnessed a female classmate being beaten to a bloody pulp because her &#8220;boyfriend&#8221; wanted money. Another time a pregnant student went into labor and disrupted the entire school by wallowing on the hallway floor and screaming like an banshee. Needless to say we no longer host exchange students.</p>

		<p>Woefully, an all too typical illustration of the black attitude, and even more sadly, an all too typical response by liberals and public education (one and the same thing these days).  Blacks want the privileges, but don&rsquo;t exercise the responsibilities.  Blacks want the benefits of achievement, but don&rsquo;t want to do the work it requires.  Blacks want - no EXPECT - jobs, college placement, higher wages, respect, diplomas and degrees but don&rsquo;t show up for classes or work, and put out NO effort to obtain these things.  They expect everything to be handed to them.  They really do think they are privileged to be given all these things just because they are black.  In fact, they a stupid, lazy, and shiftless.  Just as they were depicted back in the days before &#8220;civil rights&#8221; and political correctness.  And, the liberals enable them and prop up this attitude of theirs by giving in to their demands and rewarding their behavior.<br>
With degrees, jobs, college placement, etc.  When they haven&rsquo;t earned it nor deserve it.</p>

		<p>The scariest thing is that this is one who at least hung around and kept trying   &mdash;   up until she was 21!</p>
<p>Not trying very hard, admittedly, but still trying. She had the interest  (however wishy-washy) in getting a diploma.  What about ALL THE OTHERS who couldn&rsquo;t care less and didn&rsquo;t even bother with &#8220;silly stuff&#8221; like that?  They&rsquo;ll find another way to make a living. We&rsquo;ll be reading about them in the newspapers over the next thirty years. </p>

		<p>The only course she passed was Spanish?  </p>
<p>I can pretty much guarantee you this woman is Dominican. If not that, then Honduran or something such.  As such, she does not know correct Spanish, any more than English.  Therefore, that &#8220;Spanish&#8221; class had to be dumbed down to patois and &#8220;street Spanish&#8221;&hellip;.Spanglish.</p>
<p>When I took Spanish, years ago, the Spanish-speaking students in the class who all assumed they had a guaranteed  easy mark, ALL failed the course.  The professor (a real Spaniard from Spain) warned them at the beginning of the course that this always happens and that if they did not bother to study and do the work they would fail. They paid him no attention, and that is exactly what happened. </p>
<p>Ah, but that was long ago. Obviously things are different now. Everything today has been dumbed-down to baby courses.</p>

		<p>It is the same in Los Angeles schools as well.  If a student hangs around long enough, the school is expected to graduate them regardless of attendance, grades, or pathological conduct.  This is dictated by left wing ideology and the welfare state.  That is all that public education is at this sad date.  All the evidence one needs is that this young person does not even have any sense of the absurdity of sneaking into a previous graduation ceremony or to have not even tried to fulfill any of her &#8216;last chance&rsquo; opportunities to get focused in school.  Sad on every level.</p>

		<p>I am a little sick and tired of these types stealing our names (Tatiana) and dragging them through the dirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tatiana&#8221;: You can&rsquo;t spell anyways so why not Shaneequa or some such drivel that would accurately reflect who you are and your status in life.</p>

		<p>I wonder if NY has the required standardized graduation tests that potential graduates must pass to graduate? I think that she probably could not pass the GED because she would have to study and take a practice test before taking the GED exam. </p>

		<p>This WOMAN could have been a special education student. In some school districts, such as Maryland, special education students can remain in school until they are 21 years of age.</p>
<p>As a retired teacher, I can attest to changes made to attendance and grades. I saw erasure marks made to attendance sheets for students who were not in my classroom during my class period. I, and other teachers, saw students &#8220;walk across the stage&#8221; at graduation, who we knew we had failed.</p>
<p>This article is not surprising to the teachers who have taught in urban schools. This is why the average teacher only remains in an urban school for 5 years. Get a Master&rsquo;s Degree and get out ASAP.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what this girl is thinking.  She obviously wanted to graduate but she didn&rsquo;t want to put in the time or effort.  Was she planning on stealing someone else&rsquo;s diploma during the graduation ceremony she crashed?</p>

		<p>This is a little off topic and I don&rsquo;t really think it applies to Tatiana but when I was in high school I had trouble passing the more complex classes because of the teaching style of the instructor.  I would fail these classes and then retake them again with a different instructor and then receive an &#8220;A&#8221; for the class.  My experience tells me teachers share just as much responsibility for the failure of our schools as the students themselves.  Frankly I&rsquo;m puzzled how any student can fail in these times with &#8220;No Child Left Behind&#8221;.  Teachers nowadays provide the answers before tests and give students the opportunity to retake them if they fail.  I would think such a system is fullproof.   </p>

		<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re giving out diplomas like it&rsquo;s a lemonade stand,&rdquo; one disgusted staffer said.</p>
<p>Huh.  I don&rsquo;t know what lemonade stand that staffer frequents, but those in my area give out lemonade, not diplomas at all.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m no happier about this news than any of the rest of you.  But what would you expect?  What else is the system to do, when it complains week in and week out about the &#8220;high social costs&#8221; of all these people running around w/o HS diplomas?  Since they can&rsquo;t earn real diplomas, the only recourse is to hand them out in the style of a lemonade stand.  </p>
<p>Now that they&rsquo;re doing that, all these social problems that are said to be a direct result of not having a HS diploma will go away, right?  No more crime, welfare usage, etc.  </p>

<p>In Oregon, a (quarter) black girl openly told me that you can use the book while taking the test, which is done on a computer. I am not sure if there is a time limit, but considering it is the same book they do assignments out of, you could easily just remember the pages the answers were on. </p>
<p>In my regular high school English course, my teacher used to use the practice tests from sparknotes. After that I opted for Advanced Placement. Sadly even then, we spent our time reading Malcolm X. However, my high school was strong in science in math (it was a white school). It is just a shame I never read any classics.  </p>
<p>Point is: even white schools are dumbed down for the sake of the three blacks who attend. Even if they were held to higher standards, such as in the beginning of last century, I am afraid a portion of whites might fail. But back then, you could get a factory job and still support a family. </p>

		<p>To poster 37:  I am glad I went to a school that forced us to read many classics, even though we didn&rsquo;t always understand the value at the time.  You can always play catch up.</p>
<p>To poster 31: NY has the Regents tests but I can tell you that they are a joke.  (I know becuase I give them.)  You only need to score something like 33% right to get a passing (65) grade.  The scores are inflated with a &#8216;conversion chart&rsquo; that hides the abysmal actual score.</p>

		<p>Look guys, in the end there is just one solution to this problem: the loss of reproductive liberty. I&rsquo;m not happy about that, and I know that you aren&rsquo;t either (who would want government bureaucrats to mandate the number of children they can have?), but in the end we have to prevent people full of a sense of entitlement, and not willing to play by the rules, from reproducing themselves. </p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I certainly agree with you that I&rsquo;m &#8220;not happy about it&#8221; either. That would be a very, very last resort.</p>
<p>But we are far from having explored every other possible remedy: tax incentives, family assistance &hellip; and many other devices that haven&rsquo;t yet been thought of.  We (our government) haven&rsquo;t even given it a serious try. MUCH more could be done, before going all the way to the extreme.</p>
