			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Rosen, FoxNews, July 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the annual conference of the National Urban League, which turns 100 this year, the group&rsquo;s president, Marc H. Morial, challenged the notion that the country should be entering a &#8220;post-racial&#8221; period.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Decrying inequities in the status of black men as measured against whites, the Rev. Jesse Jackson also pointed out the dire straits of federal and state budgets.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re cutting back on public transportation,&#8221; Jackson said during a morning panel discussion, &#8220;cutting back on public housing, cutting back on public ed[ucation]; and the result is [we] have built the largest jail-industrial complex in the world, of which 55 percent [of the inmate population] are black. To me that&rsquo;s the heart of the civil rights struggle.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Andrew Young, the former mayor of Atlanta and U.N. ambassador, shifted the emphasis to financial improvements for black America.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to hold on to the politics, hold on to the judiciary,&#8221; Young said during the panel, &#8220;but if we don&rsquo;t understand some of the economics, we&rsquo;ll lose them both.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vernon Jordan, who served as League president for 11 years until 1982 and is now its elder statesman, noted in his keynote address the rise of a formidable black middle class.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black buying power in 2008 was $913 billion, and is projected to reach $1 trillion in three short years,&#8221; he said, before adding: &#8220;Today more black men are in jail than in college.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Go back to the 1980 Census and you will find that there were three times as many black men in college as there were in prison; but by the 2000 Census it had flipped.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He noted that in 1970, fewer than 1,500 blacks held public office, a figure that now exceeds 10,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For all that progress, however, Jordan cited the fact that black unemployment stands over 15 percent  &mdash;  well over the national rate of 9.5 percent  &mdash;  as evidence of how much the black community must still do to achieve its goals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to say to folks in leadership, whether it is the White House or anybody else: &#8216;Don&rsquo;t be so afraid of white folks that you treat black people bad,&rsquo;&#8221; she [Maxine Waters] said. &#8220;Whether it is the White House or the NAACP, you cannot live in the moment of responding to the right-wing press, who is using that platform to literally do their organizing, to intimidate you and basically run this country!&#8221;</p>
<p>Addressing directly the &#8220;enemy&#8221; that she said confronts black America, Waters, a 10-term lawmaker known for her colorful outbursts, shouted: &#8220;Bring it on! Bring it on!&#8221;</p>
<p>Noted scholar Cornel West chided Obama for paying more attention to Wall Street than black Americans on the streets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you&rsquo;re devoted to rescuing investment bankers,&#8221; West said during an afternoon panel discussion, &#8220;you ought to be interested to rescuing Lateesha, Jamal, and the others.&#8221; He added a spirited nod: &#8220;Mr. President, love your brother!&#8221;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Now that is an interesting statement&hellip;.more for its ignorance than anything else.  Because they do not &#8220;hold&#8221; the politics nor the judiciary and they certainly don&rsquo;t understand the first thing about economics.</p>
<p>A different race holds the politics AND the judiciary.  And they most certainly DO understand economics.  And understand that what goes to non-whites is now coming out of thier own pockets.  And far from advancing their interests, non-whites have become a dangerous burden.</p>

<p>What is this idiot smoking?  The Amerikan press is &#8220;right-wing?&#8221;  Won&rsquo;t someone please lead me to this &#8220;right-wing press,&#8221; so I can start subscribing?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;you ought to be interested to (sic) rescuing Lateesha, Jamal, and the others.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And why, exactly, do Lateesha and Jamal <i>always</i> need &#8220;rescuing?&#8221;</p>
<p>This entire article is simply the usual wish list of hysterical black race-hustlers.  <br>

<p>It is so hard to be post racial when so many blacks are racist!  </p>
<p>Why should white go on being the ONLY ones that are NOT speaking up for their own interests.  <br>

		<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re cutting back on public transportation,&rdquo; Jackson said-</p>
<p>Buy your OWN transportation like the rest of us do! So now PUBLIC TRANS. is a &#8220;civil right&#8221;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;cutting back on public housing-</p>
<p>Buy your OWN housing like the rest of us do! HOUSING is now a &#8220;civil right&#8221;.</p>
<p>-cutting back on public ed[ucation];</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a proven fact that &#8220;urban&#8221; school districts receive MORE funding than &#8220;non-urban&#8221;. As usual, the blacks take much more than they give and Whites give much more than they take.</p>
<p> &ldquo;We have to hold on to the politics, hold on to the judiciary,&rdquo; Young said-</p>
<p>I agree. Once they lose those two things, their &#8216;racisim railroad to shakedown town&rsquo; will come to an end. No mo ghetto lottery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black buying power in 2008 was $913 billion, and is projected to reach $1 trillion in three short years,&rdquo; </p>
<p>Yes, thanks to those evil &#8216;racisss&rsquo; White folks. I wonder what the buying power is for blacks in Africa? I guess that would depend on the amount aid they get from Whitey, so it would vary year to year. </p>
<p> For all that progress, however, Jordan cited the fact that black unemployment stands over 15 percent &mdash; well over the national rate of 9.5 percent &mdash; as evidence of how much the black community must still do to achieve its goals.</p>
<p>translation : how much the black community must still have to shake down Whitey to achieve its goals.<br>
It NEVER occurs to these race blinded idiots to maybe create the jobs THEMSELVES! Alot of these black &#8220;leaders&#8221; at this conference are MILLIONAIRES!!! They can&rsquo;t get together to create jobs in THEIR communities!</p>
<p> &ldquo;Just as you&rsquo;re devoted to rescuing investment bankers,&rdquo; West said during an afternoon panel discussion, &ldquo;you ought to be interested to rescuing Lateesha, Jamal, and the others.&rdquo; He added a spirited nod: &ldquo;Mr. President, love your brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maybe it has to do with the fact that investment bankers help RUN the country, where as Lateesha, Jamal and &#8220;the others&#8221;, RUIN the country.  </p>

Too many black men are in jail. Too many black men don&rsquo;t have jobs.</p>
<p>Yet &#8220;black buying power in 2008 was $913 billion&#8221;.</p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t have jobs and they&rsquo;re in jail. Where are they getting this &#8216;black buying power&rsquo;?</p>

<p>And how much of that buying power is either from welfare programs or from gubmint jobs at all levels that require no actual performance?</p>
<p>It is plain from the quotes in this article that the top tier of black race hustlers are totally opposed to the notion that blacks should actually advance on their own abilities and make a positive contribution to this country without government assistance.</p>

		<p>Much of this is really just nervous political-speak. Blacks, those in power and the more astute especially, realize that their stranglehold on whites, via the perpetual guilt and racial spoils scheming, is in jeopardy. </p>
<p>Blacks and their various allies have overplayed the so-called race card, and non-blacks are obviously just sick of all this endless whining and moaning about how tough blacks have it - and they are becoming more vocal about it. </p>
<p>In a curious and perhaps wonderful way, it seems the election of the &#8220;post-racial&#8221; president has completely backfired, and created more racial consciousness than ever&hellip;and now, even whites, if only implicitly at this point, are getting on board!   </p>

<p>I think they&rsquo;ve got that one bass ackwards.</p>
<p><i>Noted scholar Cornel West chided Obama for paying more attention to Wall Street than black Americans on the streets.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you&rsquo;re devoted to rescuing investment bankers,&rdquo; West said during an afternoon panel discussion, &ldquo;you ought to be interested to rescuing Lateesha, Jamal, and the others.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Cornell West actually makes some sense with this one. Wall Street did get some sweetie pie deals from the government. Where we disagree is that the government should be rescuing Lateesha and Jamal. That&rsquo;s not the government&rsquo;s job. If we could stop the government from &#8220;rescuing&#8221; (aka &#8220;wealth redistribution&#8221;) then a lot of those people wouldn&rsquo;t need &#8220;rescuing&#8221; in the first place.</p>

<p>After President Obama won the election, I said the one good thing is that this happened when whites were still the majority.</p>
<p>Guilt ridden whites have done their sacred duty and elected what they hoped would be Americas&rsquo; racial savior. Whites have now seen that a black president isn&rsquo;t necessarily the answer.</p>
<p>Many blacks are little dictators who believe that elected power is absolute and that a black president would &#8216;do the right thing&rsquo; for the black man and seize power and control from the white man.</p>
<p>Luckily, the white majority has seen that a black president can&rsquo;t save America. Now that they&rsquo;ve given blacks their chance, whites will be less inclined to believe that a black man by virtue of being black is the answer.</p>
<p>Blacks have also learned that a black president isn&rsquo;t as powerful as they had believed and they&rsquo;re going to have to find new reasons to argue their claim that blacks need to be in power because only they can solve Americas&rsquo; &#8216;inequality&rsquo; problems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a delicate dance for blacks after President Obama is out of office to praise a black president who wasn&rsquo;t their knight in shining armor. <br>

		<p>The Ivy League prof with the bad teeth and 70&rsquo;s ugly afro, Cornel West, harangues Obama to &#8220;love your brother&#8221;.  Obama does love his brother; that is, the segment of the white population manages money, sends US profits overseas,and has laid off millions of workers, mostly white, in the past 30 years since the Gipper ripped US industry and labor to shreds.  His successors including the white Communist raised, mulatto Obama,all have followed the same pro-finance, pro free trade, pro immigration and low wage labor policies. </p>
<p>The problem is not however only the ignorance of the so called black &#8216;leaders&rsquo;.  The problem is more importantly with the ignorance of white workers, small businesspeople and even professionals that they are the subject of deliberate economic and social genocide.  The presence in the formerly majority white USA since 1980 of millions of Asians, some of whom still chatter in Chinese or Urdu when not at work, doing high paid work done years ago by whites illustrates some of my points. </p>
<p>These clowns at Urban League and NAACP don&rsquo;t even know what or who the very white leftist and phony black Obama is.  He is applying the coup de grace to America as a functioning capitalist republic.  </p>
<p>If you are not a lower paid immigrant, investment banker (like Chelsea&rsquo;s new hubby) or part of the officer elite of the interventionist New World Order palace elite, you will soon be extinct. Blacks probably won&rsquo;t be able to survive this cyclical extinction, but neither will the vast majority of whites who gobble up foreign goods with every ounce of their shrinking paychecks they can spare.</p>

<p>The widsespread discrimination against European Americans should be unsurprising.</p>
<p>All other racial groups have powers lobbying on their behalf. Blacks have the NAACP, mestizos have La Raza, Asians have the 80-20 Initiative, Indians have USINPAC, etc. What do European Americans have?</p>
<p>When groups E, D, C &amp; B lobby on behalf of their ethnic interests, and group A does nothing, group A is bound to be shafted.  And all the while this is taking place, many whites pursue the &ldquo;ostrich strategy&rdquo;. They stick their heads in the sand and wish it were otherwise.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;&hellip;Marc H. Morial, challenged the notion that the country should be entering a &ldquo;post-racial&rdquo; period.&#8221;</p>
<p>The amount of &#8220;progress&#8221; these people cite of blacks holding positions in this society amount to no more than affirmative action gimmies, and they were brought about by the same tactics they are using now, which is to whine hysterically about not having an even playing field, or being &#8220;held back&#8221; by whitey.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that there has been FAR, FAR too many blacks installed in various positions, simply to prevent rioting and an eventual race war instigated by these same crybabies.  </p>
<p>White elitist cowards give blacks free entry into college, &#8220;giveaway&#8221; grades that do not reflect their lack of understanding of the subjects they take, nor do they reflect the true level of proficiency the certificate they receive claims, because colleges are under intense pressure to pass X number of blacks no matter how miserably they might do.</p>
<p>In other words, the claim that blacks have &#8220;advanced&#8221; isn&rsquo;t an advancment at all.  It&rsquo;s merely a giveaway program to keep them from burning the country down.  Blacks would still be stuck in the same old rut if they hadn&rsquo;t pressured effeminate, do-gooder whites to qualify them for being sub-standard and doing sub-standard work.  </p>
<p>So, when we hear pitiful black lamentations as in the above article, we must understand that they want more of the same.  And the more freebies they get the more they want.  If it were up to them every unqualified black would be in some kind of position they can&rsquo;t do or in a school allegedly training for a position they can never adequately understand nor perform on an acceptable level of proficiency.</p>
<p>I have to admit that ceding to their demands by throwing them a carrot now and again does keep them from going on a muderous rampage, but at what point will the country be irrevocably harmed by having these incompetent children working at occupations and dumbing them down to moronic levels?</p>
<p>But a word of caution:  Because of black arrogance and stupidity, the more that is given to them the more they fanatically believe they have earned and the more fanatically obsessively they become in wanting to fill slots where they could cause real damage.</p>
<p>For example, right now we have a black president who has absolutely no comprehension he is destroying this country economically, because he doesn&rsquo;t have the intellect to understand, nor has he attempted to learn anything but what he has rehearsed thousands of times and is displayed on his teleprompter.  </p>
<p>Likewise we have a black in charge of NASA that knows no more about aeronautics, space travel or anything connected to it, anymore than many of us do about brain surgery. Like children, reinforced with black arrogance, blacks &#8220;think&#8221; they can perform technical duties without the intellect to do so or the training, which they can&rsquo;t do because of low intellect.</p>
<p>An objective researcher couldn&rsquo;t deny that any nation in the world today would long endure if it is comprised of large populations of blacks.  At some point critcal mass will be reached and the country involved will be either destroyed and taken over by other countries or will erupt into internecine warfare.  There are no other options.  Such a condition cannot exist indefinitely.</p>

<p>Nobody is locking up all those black felons for fun.  Nobody enjoys paying the high taxes required to maintain the prison system.  So, Mr. Jackson, if you want more money left over for public transportation try convincing more of your constituency to stop committing crimes.  Good luck with that.<br>
