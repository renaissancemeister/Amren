<h1>NAACP Renews Schools Crusade</h1>

<p>Now, a new battle is heating up, brought to a head by the Wake County school board&rsquo;s plan to end the system&rsquo;s efforts to ensure that poor and higher-income students aren&rsquo;t educated in isolation from each other.</p>
<p>Wake  &mdash;  the largest district in the state  &mdash;  would be the latest of many school systems across the state and the nation to abandon policies designed to keep schools racially and economically diverse, in favor of school choice and neighborhood schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re no longer going to sit back and watch our schools, without any challenge, go back to segregation,&#8221; said the Rev. William Barber, president of the state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. &#8220;&#8216;Separate but equal&rsquo; does not work. We know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, the NAACP filed a claim with the U.S. Department of Education, saying that schools in Wayne County had violated the Civil Rights Act by educating poor, black children in schools with virtually no white students. Barber said it could be a sign of what&rsquo;s to come in other counties, including Wake, if it returns to neighborhood-based assignment and allows schools in poor parts of the county to resegregate.</p>
<p>Home to Goldsboro and Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, Wayne County is 58 percent white. The public school population is about 44 percent white, 37 percent black, 12 percent Hispanic and about 6 percent mixed race or Asian. Eight of the 31 public schools have fewer than 20 percent white students. Nine schools are more than 60 percent white.</p>
<p>Segregation is most stark in the city of Goldsboro, where most schools are overwhelmingly black and poor.</p>
<p>Barber said he also thinks that racially segregated schools violate some students&rsquo; right to a sound, basic education, which is guaranteed under the state constitution.</p>
<p>That constitutional argument was successful for students from rural counties, who sued the state in 1994, claiming that their schools failed to provide the same quality of education available in more prosperous counties. A decade later, a Wake County judge ordered the state to improve quality in poor, rural schools.</p>
<p>Barber says he is meeting with lawyers regularly and, tonight, he will meet in downtown Raleigh with members of Wake&rsquo;s NAACP chapters to discuss strategies for fighting resegregation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Margiotta [Wake school board Chairman Ron Margiotta] said the NAACP is making premature threats. He said the school board doesn&rsquo;t yet know what a new assignment plan will look like, but he said that it will not intentionally segregate students and that it will focus on helping poor and minority students improve academic performance.</p>
<p>Board member John Tedesco said the NAACP is mired in a time when an emphasis on race was needed to overcome the vestiges of legal segregation. Now, he said, Wake has transcended race, and the board must focus on academic achievement, which still lags among poor students.</p>
<p>According to the district&rsquo;s own statistics, the graduation rate for Wake students receiving free and reduced-price lunch is 54 percent, compared with an overall rate of 78 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Re-energizing an issue</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the past decade, federal courts have lifted busing orders imposed in the 1960s, and some districts that continued race-based busing faced legal challenges. While the practice has not been universally banned, the U.S. Supreme Court has twice struck down individual race-based busing plans.</p>
<p>Those decisions prompted the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system to return to community schools, while Wake moved to a busing plan based on income.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Wake as a bellwether</b></p>
<p>Keith Sutton, a Wake school board member who supports the district&rsquo;s current diversity policy, said he sees the NAACP&rsquo;s efforts in Wayne as a warning to Wake County. He said ending busing could make Wake a flashpoint for a national battle.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>John Hood, head of the conservative John Locke Foundation, said the NAACP might have a case against a district that purposely routes black and white students into different schools. But he said Barber cannot claim that racial balance in schools is legally required.</p>
<p>Hood, who supports the Wake board&rsquo;s plan to end busing for economic diversity, said it is time to abandon the idea that schools are responsible for erasing racial divisions, and focus on issues that concern most parents: academic achievement and assignment stability.</p>

<p>Do we? We have integrated public schools in Buffalo and the failure rate for blacks is now 53%. What we do know is that integrated schools do not work.</p>
<p>The president of the Buffalo teachers union, Phil Rushmore, has said that he believes what kids (black, white, and other) learn about each other is more important than what they learn in the classroom.</p>
<p>There is no question why schools are failures. They&rsquo;re not teaching kids anymore. They&rsquo;re little more than indoctrination factories that thrive on the fantasy that forcing different people together will cause them to learn to like each other.<br>

		<p>A successful NAACP lawsuit just might be what it takes to re-energize the white right-wing racial movement in this country.  In almost every major city that had a successful white conservative race movement or group, court-ordered deseg and busing was the spark that set it off.</p>

		<p><i>Wake &mdash; the largest district in the state &mdash; would be the latest of many school systems across the state and the nation to abandon policies designed to keep schools racially and economically diverse, in favor of school choice and neighborhood schools.</i></p>
<p>This trend toward abandonment of busing has nothing to do with common sense on race, but rather is a desperate move made out of financial necessity by cities seeing their white populations (i.e., tax base) continually fleeing the metro area in response to busing policies.  And to a lesser extent the acknowledgment that after 30 years, the &#8220;problem&#8221; busing had been designed to alleviate is worse than ever, as is the quality of the schools.</p>
<p>Looked at from the perspective of the black leaders, busing can simply be seen as a means tipping the demographic, and thus political, balance in favor of blacks (see e.g. that this county is only 58% white).  Busing drives out white families   &mdash;   plainly obvious by now!   &mdash;   and thus has both a short and long term downward effect on the urban white population.  More and more black students chase after fewer and fewer whites.  In time, the whole city tips and blacks take control over city government.  &#8220;Access to education&#8221; is merely the cover.</p>

<p>When yer beating down and intimidating white people in person in real life it&rsquo;s a lot harder to believe in the &#8216;white man is hiding away and keeping me down&rsquo; spiel. You can still agree with it, and benefit from it, and spread the idea, but it&rsquo;s a lot harder Really believing it at a deep down level. </p>

		<p>I will pay attention to what the NAACP thinks, when they allow me - free of persecution - to clearly state THEIR full name in public: National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  They are rather like the current President, whose full name dare not be spoken, lest it be considered an insult.  As if he were Yahweh.</p>

		<p>I know of two incidents where Blacks have just about ruined a school and all of it was due to trying to force &#8220;integration&#8221; on an unsuspecting public. The first incident was in the late 1970&rsquo;s when the town where I graduated high school from started a magnet high school in what was a formerly all black school. To created a selective school like this (students had to apply) the current students were shifted to surrounding high schools, changing the demographic of the receiving schools. Long story short, one of these schools (which was formerly a suburban White school but was experiancing some White flight) turned into a ghetto black school with behavior problems and academic failure. It is now called a &#8220;career academy&#8221; which is just another word for a dumping ground for poor students and behavior problems. Two other schools that were once premier high schools were also brought down by the influx. Now these two schools are mediocre at best and just about as dangerous at worst. </p>
<p>The other incident was in the town where I grew up. Several high schools in the black area of town were closed (consolidated at first) and the students were shipped to a formerly White high school in a working class part of town. The district figured it would save money by moving closing smaller high schools and combining these kids into mega high schools. </p>

		<p>Bottom line&hellip;The black man wants to get in the white girls genes&hellip;biologically and pants wise. Seperate but equal doesn&rsquo;t work&hellip;The reason being that when the black and white race are seperate from eachother it is dlear to see they are not equal. Only miscegination can make them equal by destroying the native traits that have differentiated Europeans from sub saharans for millenia. A tree is known by its fruit and this is what these advocates of forced miscecination/integration don&rsquo;t want people to see.</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s right.  Separate but equal does not work.  But neither does integrated but equal.  Primarily because blacks will NEVER be equal to whites in attention span, IQ, desire to learn, or work ethic.  It&rsquo;s an absolutely silly idea that blacks will improve through sitting next to a white kid through osmosis or association.  What happens unfortunately is weak white kids begin behaving like blacks, not the other way around.<br>
The essential point is, one CANNOT improve a person&rsquo;s IQ through seating assignments.  Period.  Blacks either have to (1) work twice as hard as whites on their homework etc OR accept the kinds of jobs God intended for them when he gave them genetically lower IQ&rsquo;s to begin with.</p>

		<p>  Simply put, the euphemistically-named &#8220;white flight&#8221; was the left&rsquo;s ethnic cleansing.  The radical left&rsquo;s persecution, harassment and disposession of working-class and middle-class white ethnics constitutes one of the most grave, needless, shameful, and utterly monstrous crimes of American history. A smart conservative candidate would call them on their atrocities and let the chips fall  &mdash;  a media firestorm would follow, but since the MSM hate conservatives anyway, I say let&rsquo;s give them a reason.  In so doing,  one of the most poisonous propaganda weapons in the Marxist quiver  &mdash;  the misconception about total and automatic white privilege  &mdash;  would be shattered forever.  </p>
