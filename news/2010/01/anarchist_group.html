<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One month from today a white supremacist conference is scheduled to take place at the Dulles Airport Westin in Herndon, VA, and will feature politically connected hatemongers that will discuss how to uproot the freedoms we all enjoy to the benefit of theirs and theirs alone. For the third time in a row, the biannual American Renaissance Conference will be met. Antifa has been making this suit-and-tie Nazi nervous because we have been paying closer attention to them. It doesn&rsquo;t help much that this conference was chased out of the Marriott recently either because organizers never lost a venue in the past. For them it is only going to get worse before it gets better, and you can help that out a bit.</p>
<p>The Self Described Anarchist Collective</p>
<p>Shut Down the Racists!</p>
<p>The white supremacist newsletter American Renaissance (AmRen) is holding their 9th annual conference at the Dulles Airport Westin in Herndon, VA on Feb 19-21. The conference is thinly disguised under the name of the New Century Foundation, AmRen&rsquo;s sister organization. In response, we are asking for everyone to call the hotel and demand they cancel the conference.</p>
<p><b>What is AmRen and what do they believe?</b></p>
<p>AmRen, published by white supremacist Jared Taylor, is a newsletter that promotes pseudoscientific research which argues that non-whites are genetically and morally inferior. The AmRen conference is a melting pot of radical right-wing racist people and ideas. Previous attendees include Ku Klux Klan members (including former leader David Duke), neo-Nazis (such as Don Black), holocaust deniers, anti-immigration activists, and other ideologues promoting racial hatred. The Anti-Defamation League writes that AmRen, &#8220;promotes their views by attacking racial, ethnic, and religious diversity, which they call &#8216;one of the most divisive forces on the planet&rsquo; and therefore &#8216;dangerous&rsquo;&#8221; and that, &#8220;many of North America&rsquo;s leading intellectual racists have written for American Renaissance or have addressed the biennial American Renaissance conferences.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Who is supposed to be at the conference this year?</b></p>
<p>The keynote speaker of the conference this year is Nick Griffin, head of the British National Party (BNP) and member of the European Parliament. His attendance at the conference is troubling, as he is expected to be placed in jail soon for violating a court order in the UK to open the membership of his political party to non-whites by January, 28th. Griffin isn&rsquo;t a stranger to jail though; in 1996 he served a 9-month sentence after being found guilty of &#8216;publishing material likely to incite racial hatred&rsquo;. Griffin&rsquo;s speaking date in DC is even more disturbing because James Von Brunn, the neo-Nazi terrorist who shot and killed a security guard at the DC Holocaust Museum in June of 2009, was a member of the American Friends of the British National Party, and had been at events where Griffin Spoke. As well as being a racist, Griffin is notable for his antisemitism, and has referred to the Holocaust as the &#8216;Holohoax&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Other speakers include:</p>
<p>Dan Roodt, who argues that blacks are genetically programmed to commit violent crime, and wrote in an article on January 13th, 2010 that, &#8220;In South Africa, the white IQ is somewhere around 100 whereas the average black IQ is about 70.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Blacks generally prefer parties and festivals because a lot of them lack the mental ability to excel at such demanding subjects as mathematics and natural science which require logical reasoning and cognitive ability.&#8221; Roodt is the head of Pro-Afrikaans Action Group, a South African white supremacist organization.</p>
<p>Craig Bodeker, who said in an interview that, &#8220;The false concept of &#8216;racism&rsquo; has done more harm than just force decent white people into NOT looking-out for their own ethnic interests, while other groups are encouraged to look out for theirs. In fact, I&rsquo;ll argue that it has BANKRUPTED AMERICA!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jared Taylor, who argues that blacks are &#8220;more psychopathic than whites&#8221;, and in an article about Hurricane Katrina wrote that, &#8220;when blacks are left entirely to their own devices, Western Civilization  &mdash;  any kind of civilization  &mdash;  disappears. And in a crisis, civilization disappears overnight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam G. Dickson, who advocates white nationalism and fights against non-white immigration, affirmative action, interracial marriage, homosexuality, and school integration.</p>
<p>Raymond Wolter, who argues against school racial desegregation, and believes that blacks have more natural IQ limitations than whites.</p>
<p>Wayne Lutton, who is the director of a group which publishes the racist Occidental Quarterly journal, and the antisemitic Occidental Observer magazine.</p>
<p><b>What you can do?</b></p>
<p>The Westin Washington Dulles Hotel has not made a decision yet on whether or not they are going to allow the conference to continue. There will be a massive phone-in all day on Tuesday, January, 19th, 2010. Please contact Westin Washington Dulles Hotel and let them know how you feel. The phone number is 703-793-3366. Here is an example of what you could say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, my name is _____. I am concerned about the New Century Foundation conference which your hotel is planning to host on February 19th through 21st. I would hope that you will choose to uphold your company&rsquo;s commitment to diversity and to ensuring the safety of your customers by choosing to cancel the conference. I understand that several of the conference speakers have gone to prison for inciting racial violence, and in the interest of the safety of the DC community, and of all people worldwide, I ask that you do not endorse these views. I see the decision to host this conference at your hotel as an irresponsible promotion of racist ideology, and if you choose not to cancel the conference, I will no longer be giving any of my business to the Westin, and will be advising all of my family and friends to do the same. Thanks for your time.&#8221;</p>
<p>PLEASE FORWARD WIDELY. TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS, RELATIVES AND AQUAINTANCES! SHUT DOWN THE RACISTS!</p>
<p>Afterword:</p>
<p>But what about free speech?</p>
<p>From the ARA FAQ: &#8220;Free speech shouldn&rsquo;t endanger people&rsquo;s lives. You can&rsquo;t yell &#8220;Fire!&#8221; in a crowded theater, because people will probably get hurt trying to get out. We think that hate speech acts in the same way  &mdash;  by trying to make certain kinds of people seem less than human and by glorifying violent acts against them  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before a follower or supporter of a hate group puts words into action We think that hate speech, turning people into scapegoats and targets for hateful action, is an abuse of free speech and that people&rsquo;s lives are more important than the right of someone to publicly encourage others to target certain groups for a campaign of murder, rape, assault, genocide, ethnic cleansing and terror. If you actively go out of your way to tell people that 90% of the world&rsquo;s population should be enslaved or that the best thing they can do is kill someone because of their skin color, religion, ethnic background, immigration status, sexual orientation, disability, etc., we think you&rsquo;ve forfeited your right to free speech.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it better to just ignore racists?</p>
<p>&#8220;Ignoring a problem never makes it go away. If hate groups encounter no opposition to their activities in a community, they&rsquo;ll take that to mean that they have no opposition there willing to stand up to them and they will act accordingly. This makes it more likely that hate group activity will increase and they will start hurting people. This also isolates the people they target  &mdash;  people of color, immigrants, religious or ethnic minorities, gays and lesbians, the disabled, women, etc.  &mdash;  making them feel vulnerable and afraid because it seems like no one has their back.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Does AR have a contract with the hotel?  If the hotel gets cold feet because of the ARA domestic terrorists, then you can sue ARA, (go venue shopping for a good jurisdiction), and sue them for tortious interference of contract.  That just might put them out of business.</p>

<p>&#8220;WE THINK&#8221;??? </p>
<p>Just who are these people to decide what hate speech is and what any ensuing penalty would be for allegedly using hate speech??</p>
<p>To me these folks are trying to deny those who are attempting to assemble in a peaceful manner the right to peacefully assemble and also the right to free speech. Mr Taylor, would not a sizable civil rights lawsuit filed against these people more than likely result in an about face on their part? At the very least, I would think it would discourage any group from attempting the same thing at future conferences. Too, it would no doubt be a national story and generate much publicity for AmRen.</p>

		<p>From their scripted complaint&hellip;<i> I would hope that you will choose to uphold your company&rsquo;s commitment to diversity and to ensuring the safety of your customers by choosing to cancel the conference.</i></p>
<p>I always assumed that Whites were meant to be part of the &#8216;diversity&rsquo; in this NWO vision. This statement makes it sound like there&rsquo;s diversity on one side and (pro)White folks on the other side.<br>
I appreciate that skins tones aren&rsquo;t what it&rsquo;s all about, but it still doesn&rsquo;t sound very &#8216;diverse&rsquo;.<br>
Not a good deal when you&rsquo;re White.<br>
Anyway it&rsquo;s only white countries that seem to be obsessed with this diversity bunk anyway.</p>
<p>The rest of this quote from this script sounds like these protesters are going to orchestrate violence themselves. <br>
The local police needs to let this group know that this behavior will not be tolerated.<br>
And there will need to be a law enforcement presence there to protect the conference attendee&rsquo;s and camera&rsquo;s to document some evidence. (I&rsquo;ve never been to a conference so pardon me if that&rsquo;s a standard procedure.)<br>
Good for publicity I suppose, but I get sick of hearing about this type of brutish, bullying behavior from the left.<br>
Personally I think physical violence should be saved as a last resort for personal self defense, not as a political tool.<br>
It&rsquo;s ashame because it sounds like a really great conference with a once in a life time, line up of international speakers.<br>
I can&rsquo;t wait to hear about it.</p>

		<p>Yes, there must be some legal action to take against these people. This article sickens me because these people are more of a hate group than those they accuse. I honestly see them as the new KGB with a terrorist slant. They refuse to listen to anyones argument or information and only want to silence you with threats and intimidation. Kind of reminds me of my college days&hellip;</p>

If the hotel is at the airport then anyone entering with a terrorist threat against the occupants of the hotel come under TSA.  If these people are threatening AC then TSA is compelled by law to move against them.</p>

		<p>This main geek is something of an oddball kook who makes it plain that he&rsquo;s so fanatically in favor of his version of diversity it&rsquo;s made him unhinged even more than he was when he first began his rants.  I get the impression that he knows better about what AR is about, but he obviously feels terribly threatened by the organization.  Probably because it has been so effective.</p>
<p>He gives a lot of bluster about &#8220;shutting them down,&#8221; but I doubt the only people involved in this are the flakes, oddballs and misfits that were at the last AR conference.  They were about as effective as a sail made from a fishnet.  </p>
<p>Nobody can love diversity for diversity&rsquo;s sake so enthusiastically unless he is certifiable, so I&rsquo;m guessing this diversity nonsense is his way of trying to gain some kind of inner security from the phantoms that haunt his troubled mind.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see this same oddball demonstrating at a skinnhead meeting, because they&rsquo;re almost as unstable as he is and would more than likely shut him down for good if he ever showed his face.  He knows that, of course.  It is people who act civilly and obey the law who are his targets.  That way he&rsquo;s assured he won&rsquo;t be picking his teeth up from the sidewalk when he shows up for his intimidation and harassing techniques.  He&rsquo;s your usual spineless coward.</p>
<p>As I recall, the last time they showed up they looked foolish and gave a pretty bad impression of what they were all about, and they didn&rsquo;t make anybody miss a step.  If I hadn&rsquo;t seen the video, I would never had known they were even outside the conference.</p>
<p>From all this fool&rsquo;s bluster, one would get the impression that the One People&rsquo;s Project amounts to something more than an adult male using his bedroom in his mother&rsquo;s house as headquarters, because he&rsquo;s operating under a really stringent budget.</p>

		<p>I hope that every sypathetic visitor to this site will take a few minutes to use the posted phone number in order to encourage Westin to live up to its contract and allow the conference.  This is your opportunity to do something for the cause without costing you any money or much effort.</p>

<p>I am disgusted and appalled to learn that Marriott has gutlessly decided to bow to the whims of this &ldquo;Anarchist Collective,&rdquo; and associated Red fools&rsquo; hives like The One People&rsquo;s Project. It should be called, The One Potheads&rsquo; Project; or better still, The One Projects&rsquo; Peoples. </p>
<p>Question Diversity is correct, AR should sue the Marriot if they have broken a contract with them. It would be interesting to see how their defense attorneys might describe the hotel&rsquo;s actions. After all, isn&rsquo;t refusing accommodations to &ldquo;racists,&rdquo; discrimination?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Shut down the racists!&#8221;</p>
<p>BURN THE WITCH! BURN THE WITCH!</p>
<p>See any correlation?</p>
<p>The only way I can see how this conference, as a form of free speech, &#8220;endangers people&rsquo;s lives&#8221; as the the article&rsquo;s afterword posits is the danger it places the lives of its organizers, speakers and attenders in. They are being threatened and persecuted by these miscreants because of what they believe in, not because of what they&rsquo;ve done. They claim to fight a group that &#8220;threatens to uproot your freedoms&#8221; while simultaneously compromising the freedom of others.</p>
<p>What a laughable hypocrisy. I can respect those people who actually sit down and listen to us and argue with us in a civil manner although those are few and far in between. They are unlike the violent masked cretins or the  ticking time bombs shrouded with intellectual pretension (ie. those who engage in civil conversation but quickly resort to foul language and insults when they&rsquo;re pushed into a corner). But I cannot respect those pretentious individuals who use a priori labels (racist, white supremacist, bigot) as a way to attack a harmless opponent and take such an ignorant, childish approach to the ideology of racial separatism.</p>
<p>Even as an aimless liberal some years ago, whenever I came upon the antics of anti-racist activists I always looked at them as a group of pretentious, arrogant and ignorant people who came off more as avid time-wasters than anyone who would be capable of intellectual discourse. Perhaps it was because I, unlike them, was willing to look at things from their point of view. I was never so passionate about anti-racist activism because it seemed to ignore so very many things.</p>

<p>At least they are paying attention to what AmRen&rsquo;s posters say now and then. As a disinterested party, of course, I would prefer to characterize it as being pro-white, or promoting a white racial consciousness, an activist consciousness, if you will, rather than calling it hate. </p>

1) Why hold this conference in a hotel? Perhaps you could find a location on private property. Or at least somewhere that you know these tactics won&rsquo;t result in your conference being cancelled. 
<br>
2) Amren supporters could call the hotel and encourage the hotel not to cave to anarchist intimidation.
<br>
3) Lastly, I wouldn&rsquo;t take these people <b>too</b> seriously. No one else does.

		<p>Well, fellow AmRen-ners, we are NOT helpless!!  I have taken down the number for the Westin Hotel, the dates of the conference, etc. etc., and I am going to call the hotel and thank them for having the integrity and fairness to allow the New Century Foundation Conference to be held at their hotel, and that I will encourage everyone I know to stay there when in DC.  Of course, if they cancel the conference, I will be sending money to NCF to help fund a lawsuit for breach of contract, and will encourage everyone I know to stay elsewhere when in DC.  What&rsquo;s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander&hellip;.</p>

		<p>OPP/ARA like to denounce AR&rsquo;s &#8220;anti-Semitism,&#8221; but even the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL have recognized that there is just as much pro-Semitism in the AR community.  That you&rsquo;re more fanatical than the ADL and SPLC should be a warning sign.</p>
<p>As for this milieu, I suspect a college or university professor is behind this.  It&rsquo;s mainly young people mouthing off here.  As I used to be young, I&rsquo;m familiar with the nature of young people.  Wherever there are masses of young people doing something seemingly insane, there is an old man behind it.  When groups of young people armed with guns take a foreign city, there is an old man with five stars on his helmet behind it.  Likewise, when left wing extremists like to show off, there&rsquo;s an old man with tenure behind it.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that most posters on this site never express any anti-Semitic ideas. In fact, most contributing writers for the newsletter discuss how European-Jews as well as East Asians have higher IQ&rsquo;s than the very ethnicities this organization seems to be set up to defend&hellip;Whites of European decent.

		<p>It&rsquo;s remarkable how this works - anyone who questions even the smallest detail of modern WW2 orthodxy is automatically a Holocaust &#8220;denier.&#8221; Any science that you don&rsquo;t like is &#8220;pseudoscience.&#8221; Beleieving an illegal tidal-wave of thirdworld cast-offs is bad for your nation&rsquo;s health makes you an &#8220;anti-immigration activist.&#8221; Etc., etc. </p>
<p>However, insisting that something as brutally obvious as RACE itself does not even exist, and is all a figment of our wicked, bigotted imaginations, a &#8220;social construct,&#8221; or some similar lunacy is considered not only a sane position, but the only morally acceptable one to take.</p>
<p>The gloomiest part of the Dark Ages had nothing on us today for sheer disconnection from reality and reason.  </p>

		<p>People who overcompensate like this are just exposing their doubt about the egalitarian dogma they believe in. The more fanatical one is, the more doubt they have and the more fanatical one is the more intolerant they usually become. This is their egalitarian fatwa so to speak and it makes them look desperate, foolish and insecure. </p>

		<p>If this weird assortment of defectives do actually show up at the conference, here&rsquo;s a suggestion. Go out with a camera and get good clear photographs of every one of them. Ask for their names and see if they&rsquo;ll identify themselves. When they leave, follow them to their cars and get their license plate numbers. Once this info is gathered, spread it around liberally (so to speak). </p>
<p>Their goal is to &#8220;out&#8221; AmRen to the wider community. Fair enough, no one at the conference should be ashamed of AmRen&rsquo;s methods or goals.</p>
<p>And in turn, if these goofballs truly believe in silencing political speech that they disagree with, then they too should be willing to be outed. Also, if there are any future threats or, god forbid, assaults against AmRen members, then gathering this kind of info could be invaluable.</p>

		<p>Now that the &#8220;person&#8221; called Hal Turner has been &#8220;outed&#8221; and determined to be an agent provocateur for the federal government, stirring up hate and anger just to see what happens, it would be interesting to see if this &#8220;anarchist&#8221; group also has connections or is under the control of the FBI or other similar federal agency. I hate to even think that our own government is capable of such shenanigans, but I know it to be true all so well.</p>

<p>I think what&rsquo;s going on with this One Sheople&rsquo;s Project is that it&rsquo;s all a looney see looney do in response to the SPLC&rsquo;s fund raising success until recently.  I may or may not have agreed with organizations like the the ADL or the Simon Wiesenthal Center on everything they did or wanted, but they weren&rsquo;t into this fanatical paranoia-industrial complex hustling until Morris Dees came along, and made a lot of money off people that would ordinarily give to the ADL or SWC.  A dollar given to the SPLC is not given to the ADL or SWC, and the leaders of those organizations got jealous, so they, too, put their hat in the ring.  Even though they&rsquo;re still competitors, and constantly try to one-up each other.</p>
<p>And other people saw what was going on, and started new groups to get their hands in the cookie jar.  That&rsquo;s where this One Sheople&rsquo;s Project came from, and other ones, such as the Center for New Community, ProVote, Imagine2050, and others.</p>

&#8220;From the ARA FAQ: &ldquo;Free speech shouldn&rsquo;t endanger people&rsquo;s lives. You can&rsquo;t yell &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; in a crowded theater, because people will probably get hurt trying to get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are many different kinds of speech. Assuming that the crowded theater is not on fire, the example above is simply a lie, without any redeeming value i.e. it has nothing in common with political speech, it is not an opinion etc. Free speech is protected because it is the best path to truth, so the argument of the above example has no merit. The irony is that if any side should be silenced, it is the this one world project as they make no attempt to refute the AR argument, but I rather prefer otherwise because their speech betrays their lack of critical thinking, a heartening truth, I think. </p>

		<p>If it is indeed untrue that blacks have an average IQ of 70 against an average of 100 for Whites, perhaps these same blacks would care to properly refute this oft quoted statistic. If Katrina did not expose blacks for the psychopathic race they are, then, again, they should properly refute this and explain why the Tsunami in Sumatra and earthquakes in Japan had the opposite affect on the non-black residents who immediately pulled together to help one another. Also, explain why the same pre-earthquake black gun gangs are still terrorising the black inhabitants in Haiti and why not a single black or african organisation or country has rushed aid and black personnel to help out. It does not count as help to have some black American preacher mouthing off &#8216;we must do more to help&rsquo;. There are thousands of well equipped US troops hiding out at the airport in Haiti right now, all of whom need to be housed and fed but appear to be scared of a few gun-toting thugs dressed in tee shirts, baggy pants and wearing flip-flops. Could it be that the POTUS is worried about some White US soldier shooting some black looter live on CNN or BBC and being castigated at home by the same left wing nutters who would try to shut down an AMREN conference in the name of freedom. This call to protest against claimed White supremacists is certainly bad timing considering past and present events in Haiti and exactly who it is who fixes the mess and exactly who does nothing but complain, talk and swagger. To return to the subject of black IQ and psychopathic behaviour; New Orleans, Detroit, Zimbabwe and South Africa spring to mind as excellent starting points for the discussion.</p>

<p>I really hate it when posters object to &#8216;egalitarianism&rsquo;, saying it in a way as if what he is saying doesn&rsquo;t need to be explained, which I suppose is the whole point, raising our ire. If you believe in white supremacy, say so. If you just think the races are different, say that.

		<p>AmRens detractors are scared to death of us, because of the nature of our supporters. We are not shirtless, gap-toothed, beer swilling white trash, or Nazi-fanatics.<br>
 We are articulate, educated( HS diploma at least)and use various Gov&rsquo;t source statistics to make our arguments. We use rational thought and logic in our thought processes,speech and actions. We conduct ourselves with civility and decorum, as opposed to spewing mindless slurs.<br>
 All of these things I have just mentioned in conjuntion with rejecting across the board anti-semitism make us unable to be lampooned or dismissed out of hand as ignorant, uneducated white trash.  Increasingly we are appealing to mainstream middle class White America, for this we are the Sum of all fears for the muli-cultural diversty lefties. <br>

		<p>Here is &#8220;One People&rsquo;s Project&#8221; in their previous struggle against our First Amendment rights at the 2008 Conference, which I attended: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jrR5Clnwsc" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jrR5Clnwsc</a></p>
<p>Hey OPP, did you know the hated white man wrote the Constitution? I think the talker&rsquo;s name is Daryle Lamont Jenkins. I think my rental car is visible in the video! </p>
<p>I used to check out the &#8220;One People&rsquo;s Project&#8221; website just to peruse their case and guess their IQs. Unlike here, they won&rsquo;t let anyone who disagrees post. So it got dull.</p>
<p>At the 2008 AR Conference I saw a handful of them at quite a distance. They disappeared long before the day ended. The police I chatted with seemed sympathetic to us. Obviously – for who caused the disturbance? I felt like demanding the protesters put on a better show. We need publicity!</p>
<p>Ironically, being back in Northern Virginia where I spent my childhood, diversity&rsquo;s ravages were clear. Fairfax County was pleasant suburbia once, known for good schools, lovely parks and colonial history   &mdash;   a civilized contrast to the District of Columbia&rsquo;s ghettos. Now, thousands of Latino gangbangers, illegals and the rest of the multicultural invasion have transformed Northern Virginia too. Finding someone who spoke adequate English to give directions to the hotel was a challenge. All the more reason to hold this conference to discuss the cliff our rulers are marching us off. </p>
<p>God, I&rsquo;d love to attend the 2010 Conference, to meet some thoughtful, independent-minded, civilized people. White Nationalists sure aren&rsquo;t who we&rsquo;re painted to be. The only ignorant, intolerant thugs will be demonstrating outside. </p>
<p>This time, the conference is just SO far away from me, I don&rsquo;t think I can swing it. Well, Godspeed to all who go. With a radical, anti-white leftist in the White House, let&rsquo;s hope the government doesn&rsquo;t interfere. As this story shows, Leftists pat themselves on the back for silencing dissent. Without giving the thugs too many details, please post good reports here.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We think that hate speech, turning people into scapegoats and targets for hateful action, is an abuse of free speech and that people&rsquo;s lives are more important than the right of someone to publicly encourage others to target certain groups for a campaign of murder, rape, assault, genocide, ethnic cleansing and terror.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheeesh! This fool should have a perusal of the crime statistics! Who the hell from Amren has ever &#8216;publicly encouraged&rsquo; the actions that the above extreme statement suggest anyway?</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;If you actively go out of your way to tell people that 90% of the world&rsquo;s population should be enslaved or that the best thing they can do is kill someone because of their skin color, religion, ethnic background, immigration status, sexual orientation, disability, etc., we think you&rsquo;ve forfeited your right to free speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;We&rsquo;&hellip;I don&rsquo;t think there is a &#8216;we&rsquo;, maybe a acne-faced teenager trying to meet people. <br>
From my limited experience with this sort, they invariably have nice parents with a nice house and for some reason are embarrassed about their nice parents and house and their cushy life. This for some strange reason tends to push them into silly sloganeering about &#8216;racism&rsquo;, &#8216;sexism&rsquo; and &#8216;fascism&rsquo;. A meaningless quest for &#8216;solidarity&rsquo; with alien (yet somehow alluring to them) racial, ethnic and religious groups that they have had no experience with, or maybe had never even heard of. It also leads to dressing like a vagrant and a silly hair-do.<br>
Of course, you cannot have a debate or even a slight discussion with this lot unless you agree with them completely - if you don&rsquo;t they will invariably call you a &#8216;fascist.&rsquo; When this happens, ask them what a fascist is&hellip;<br>

		<p>my ex wife was a bleeding heart liberal attorney that loved to hang out with the &#8216;anarchists&rsquo; here in Indy about 7 years ago. They are all college educated  children with priviledged backgrounds. I was initially intrigued by them. In time, I found all the males to be directionless bums that the anarchist females resented because they did nothing to support themselves. They were into raiding dumpsters for food (seriously) and planning their next &#8216;protest&rsquo;. They were extremely paranoid of outsiders. anytime one of them misbehaved at a protest, they cried &#8216;agent provocateur&rsquo;. They liked to relive the glory days of the Seattle protest in the late 90s..and I found them to be quite ineffective at anything they attempted. </p>

I was only asking for there thoughts or comments, trying to open a debate, in the end I got only one reply out of 200. Only 1 from an American Jewish lady telling me she no longer works for the fair housing department (LOL), she even gave me there e-mail address and signed the letter of SOLIDARITY!(Solidarity is the name of the old White-Workers-Union in South Africa).

		<p>These half-wits don&rsquo;t know that the &#8220;fire in a crowded theater&#8221; Supreme Count decision was used during World War I to silence socialists and anarchists just like themselves. They&rsquo;re also using the laws on hate speech that &#8220;incites violence&#8221; as a wedge to shut the conference down. What kinds of anarchists are these? Apparently, the kind that believe in government and the rule of law. Let&rsquo;s all book mark their page and trot out their language the next time a judge tells an anarchist they can&rsquo;t yell fire in a crowded theater as the nation is going to war against X country.</p>

		<p>I think that Amren and the New Century Foundation can obtain an &#8220;order of protection&#8221; that would force all anarchists to maintain a distance of 100-feet or more.  This is possible because those people have publicly stated their intent to &#8220;shut down&#8221; the meeting.  Previous unlawfulness by these anarchists is well documented.</p>
<p>Surely an attorney should be consulted or just go to the police department and obtain an order!</p>

		<p>I first learned of Jared Taylor in 1991; I&rsquo;ve been a financial supporter of his organization since.  It has become increasingly rare to hear the truth spoken in this once-great nation.  I was drawn to Taylor because of his willingness to do so.  Older, aware white folks know well the tragic consequences brought on by a government seemingly deaf to the desires of the majority, a people who built the greatest civilization this planet has known.  Diversity is not a strength.  It is, in fact, our greatest weakness.  Open your eyes, people.  The hour draws nigh.</p>

		<p>Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but isn&rsquo;t Anarchy defined as &#8220;A social state in which there is no governing person or group of people, but each individual has absolute liberty (without the implication of disorder).&#8221;</p>
<p>In which case, in a typical anarchy, an individual would do&hellip; whatever said individual wanted to do.  So why should they care what Jared Taylor chooses to talk about?</p>
<p>Sounds to me like they&rsquo;re just a bunch of dumb underage(or mentally immature older chaps) brats who didn&rsquo;t bother to even look up the elementary definition of the ideology they&rsquo;re claiming to follow.</p>

		<p><i>The Anti-Defamation League writes that AmRen, &ldquo;promotes their views by attacking racial, ethnic, and religious diversity, which they call &lsquo;one of the most divisive forces on the planet&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta love the ADL. They really think they&rsquo;ve made a profound statement by accusing AR of calling &#8220;diversity,&#8221; &#8220;divisive.&#8221; Wow. Big thinkers, these ones. What a stinging rebuke.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Free speech shouldn&rsquo;t endanger people&rsquo;s lives.</i></p>
<p>And exactly how many people have been killed, injured, or even remotely endangered at previous AmRen conventions?</p>
<p><i>You can&rsquo;t yell &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; in a crowded theater, because people will probably get hurt trying to get out. We think that hate speech acts in the same way &mdash; by trying to make certain kinds of people seem less than human and by glorifying violent acts against them &mdash; </i></p>
<p>Glorifying violent acts? Examples please? I&rsquo;ve been a regular AmRen reader for some time now, and while I have read statements of support for people defending themselves against violent attack, I&rsquo;ve yet to read any advocation of aggression against anyone. </p>
<p><i>it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before a follower or supporter of a hate group puts words into action.</i></p>
<p>Again, examples? No? OK, let me try: Black Panthers attacking/threatening people in front of polling places, enviro-freaks burning peoples&rsquo; trucks and SUVs, leftists staging riots and violent protests at political conventions and summits, and let&rsquo;s not forget the myriad of murderous Islamists. Hey, whaddya know? You might be onto something there.</p>
<p><i>We think that hate speech, turning people into scapegoats and targets for hateful action, is an abuse of free speech and that people&rsquo;s lives are more important than the right of someone to publicly encourage others to target certain groups for a campaign of murder, rape, assault, genocide, ethnic cleansing and terror.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d ask again for examples, but if they haven&rsquo;t mentioned any this far into the article, I&rsquo;m not holding my breath.</p>
<p><i>If you actively go out of your way to tell people that 90% of the world&rsquo;s population should be enslaved or that the best thing they can do is kill someone because of their skin color, religion, ethnic background, immigration status, sexual orientation, disability, etc., we think you&rsquo;ve forfeited your right to free speech.</i></p>
<p>You might find plenty of examples of all these things on sites for black power groups, or even mere afro-centric magazines (on threads for the Jamaica Star newspaper, I&rsquo;ve read numerous posts advocating the killing of white Americans, including bombing elementary schools), but on AmRen they&rsquo;re non-existent. </p>
<p>As for that last sentence, the translation is as follows: If you voice any opinion on any matter with which they disagree, they think you&rsquo;ve forfeited your right to free speech.</p>

		<p>I have been a reader of the Amren website for several years now and have never seen anything like this buffoon puts forth. I have never seen a Holocaust denial article, anything stating that 90% of humankind should be enslaved or anything even vaguely like that. Most articles clearly state the the races are different and forcing people who are so different together is a recipe for disaster. </p>

If you believe in white supremacy, say so. If you just think the races are different, say that.

<p>What is revealed by being violent is that one is a practitioner of human predatory behavior in persuit of personal gain.  Not doubt about a belief.</p>
<p>The anti-Whites reveal their doubt by never using science to argue the facts and nothing but the facts.  Informed pro-Whites use facts that no one ever refutes with science.  (That means the informed pro-Whites are telling the truth.)</p>
<p>What raises your ire is that YOU had an opportunity to argue the facts and chose not to because you can&rsquo;t argue with the facts.</p>
<p>When you realize what that means you will either accept the facts and or revert to human predatory behavior.</p>
<p>To echo other posters, the anti-Whites are secretly greatful that American Renaissance is a civilized organization.  They know better than to directly attack violent men.</p>
<p>I wish the police all the best in neutralizing the threat of the anti-Amren demonstrators.</p>

<p>&ldquo;News to john pm there are many &lsquo;potheads&rsquo;like myself who have been on the front lines fighting the battle for are white people,you sound like a elist thumbing your knose at us low life &lsquo;WHITE TRASH&rsquo;without us you guys are screwed.Maybe you should rant about alcohol(far more destructive than pot,phsycially and to society at large).Somehow you think all people who use cannibas are liberal nut jobs(wrong).We need all white on board if we stand any chance at getting this country back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What an odd and rambling post!</p>
<p>To start with, it is you who are making the socioeconomic stereotypes here, not me. You seem to fail to realize that the use of marijuana is not restricted to &ldquo;WHITE TRASH&rdquo; as you describe working-class or blue-collar whites, but cuts across all socioeconomic classes. Thus, your ranting about my being an &ldquo;elist&rdquo; thumbing my &ldquo;knose&rdquo; at such people is entirely erroneous. I am sure most white people in these socioeconomic strata would be appalled by your strange connection between your drug abuse and their position in society. </p>
<p>Second, your assertion alcohol is more destructive than marijuana, is utterly laughable. This is not to say that I am making a pitch in favor of alcoholism, but only wish to dispel your bizarre claim that THC use is borderline harmless in comparison. Prolonged and regular use of the drug can impact people both physically and emotionally just like booze. For example, smoking the stuff unfiltered is as likely to give you cancer as cigarettes. </p>
<p>Finally, you would be advised not to come on this website under the influence of &ldquo;cannibas&rdquo; as it might improve your spelling and other writing skills,</p>

<p>This is the most important comment on this thread.</p>
<p>I doubt even one of these pretend radicals patronizes the Westin or Marriott.</p>
<p>But I do.</p>
<p>I contacted the Dulles Westin via e-mail and thanked them for hosting the AmRen conference.  I wrote to them that I and my family will make a point of patronizing the Westin and its affiliates when we travel around the US  &mdash;  San Francisco, Las Vegas, Hawaii, Indianapolis and more.</p>
<p>If they cancel the conference, I will e mail again and let them know that neither I nor any member of my family will spend another dollar in one of their businesses.</p>
<p>Do what the radicals do  &mdash;  let these businesses know loudly and clearly how you feel and that you will patronize them or one of their competitors accordingly.</p>

		<p>To my knowledge no speaker at an American Renaissance conference has ever advocated violence.  But I have no doubt that the anarchists in Antifa will heckle and threaten violence against the attendees of the conference.  The left is by far the biggest enemy of free speech, and of free association.</p>
<p>Years of careful research by people like Jensen and Bouchard are dismissed as &#8220;pseudoscience&#8221; by the ADL, SPLC, and Antifa because their conclusions don&rsquo;t match the predetermined doctrine of the left.  These are the same people who sneer at biblical literalists for not believing in evolution, when in both cases it is a matter of people rejecting uncomfortable facts that upset previously held beliefs.</p>
<p>Do these guys ever protest the much bigger meetings of the anti-white, anti-Jewish, and black separatist Nation of Islam?  Of course not.  Not just because they are hypocrites, but also because they know that while they are taking no real risks protesting the Amren conference, they might get beaten up or shot if they get in the face of the NOI.</p>
<p><i>We think that hate speech, turning people into scapegoats and targets for hateful action, is an abuse of free speech and that people&rsquo;s lives are more important than the right of someone to publicly encourage others to target certain groups for a campaign of murder, rape, assault, genocide, ethnic cleansing and terror.

<p>The hate speech is coming from Antifa.  They certainly hate us.  No speaker at the conference has encouraged violence or slavery.  Indeed, slavery was the worst idea that our ancestors had.  Because of their love of cheap labor the wealthy elites of the time have bequeathed to us a permanently underperforming population.  Although Antifa likes to flatter itself as &#8220;anti-fascist&#8221;, if they want to know what a fascist is they need only look in the mirror.  They, not me, are the ones favoring a big, powerful state, one that tells you what you must think and what you are allowed to say, whom you must employ and whom you must deal with.  They, not most of us, are the supporters of Obama&rsquo;s version of National Socialism.  Many of us voted for the least fascist, most pro-freedom, pro-peace, anti-big government candidate   &mdash;   Ron Paul.  He would not agree with some of our views but in a free country people can disagree.</p>
<p>For 14 Anonymous, who wrote: <i>1) Why hold this conference in a hotel? Perhaps you could find a location on private property. Or at least somewhere that you know these tactics won&rsquo;t result in your conference being cancelled.</i></p>
<p>A hotel <i>is</i> private property.  If the conference was held in Jared Taylor&rsquo;s own home I&rsquo;m sure the Antifa gang would show up on his front lawn to protest.</p>

<p>Then again, if you were only smokin&rsquo; pot in the anarchists&rsquo; camp, you&rsquo;d be considered a lightweight!</p>

<p>Woah now this is funny. I thought Anarchists are supposed to be disorganized and highly decentralized, certainly not a &#8220;Collective&#8221;.<br>
For &#8220;Anarchists&#8221; they sure do exhibit a lot of top-down centralized management. There&rsquo;s even a fill-in-the-blank form for their members with specific instructions so they don&rsquo;t have to think for themselves.</p>

		<p> Mexican_American&hellip;Congratulations on having the courage and individuality to approach this question as an individual thinking person. This individuality&hellip; is probably what attracted me to this site&hellip; To have an honest open forum where topics of society can be discussed. You ask: What makes whites think they are better than others? I have to ask you why do you draw the conclusion that this Idea of superiority is the central theme of this site? But to get to the point you may be aiming at&hellip; We have all heard of competition&hellip; Sperm cells.. compete with eacother to get to the egg in order to fertilize it in which case they live on and do not perish. So we can see human life begins with competition. Ask yourself, what would life be like without this struggle of survival? Another aspect of life is Identity&hellip;What would you feel if some authority told you that all people are equal and thus aught to eat the same foods, believe the same things and take the job that the authority deems necessary for the good of the whole? Then tells you it is illegal to disagree because only {believing yourself better/superior} could prompt you to believe you are different than any other person. The point I&rsquo;m trying to make is do you think individuality is wrong? If it is not wrong for an individual than why should it be wrong for a group of people. The word better can have different meanings&hellip;Take for instance.. Countries&hellip; They are all equally correctly called countries but is it true they are equal in wealth or standard of living or justice or freedom of citizens&hellip;I don&rsquo;t think so&hellip; And as the saying goes a tree is known by its fruit&hellip; It also seems logical that the cultural fruits of the European People is the European culture&hellip; this culture is their group identity and is tied in with there genes&hellip;why should these not be preserved?</p>

		<p>As an aside, the very multicultural diversity these &#8220;anarchists&#8221; advocate can only be maintained through constant intervention by a government possessing dictatorial powers - as we have seen in the case of the courts and police in Britain and elsewhere in Europe.  It is a very dishonest &#8220;anarchist&#8221; who advocates such a form of government.  &#8220;Red fascist&#8221; would be a more useful description.</p>

<p>Well I&rsquo;m back in the country now and just in time it appears. If, just for argument&rsquo;s sake, the author of this article is a politically correct, diversity promoting anarchist, then wouldn&rsquo;t it follow that he, of all people, should be supporting the conference and not opposing it? After all, how much more diverse could one ever get than supporting someone 180 degrees Antwerp to your own political position?</p>
<p>For example, I would seriously doubt that any member here would object to these Anarchists promoting their own conference  [assuming that the views expressed were non violent]. </p>
<p>It is axiomatic that &#8220;those&#8221; who support diversity the most are the same &#8220;those&#8221; who are the least tolerant of any view, that is &#8220;diverse&#8221;, in any way, from any view held by themselves.</p>
<p>Go ahead and have the conference I may just attend it now myself!</p>

<p>I can only speak for myself, and do not presume to do so for anyone else. Although, I figure it is likely you&rsquo;d find more than a few posters here who agree with me.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the short, short, in-a-nutshell version:</p>
<p>While I reckon it&rsquo;s an obvious part of human nature to consider one&rsquo;s own kind/mentality/values superior- or at least heavily preferable- to others, being the &#8220;better&#8221; race isn&rsquo;t really so much the point. The overriding point of importance is that regardless of what race might be &#8220;better&#8221; than another, there are very real differences between the races. </p>
<p>These differences are genetic and inherent. The cannot be changed in many or even most cases, and in even fewer can they be reconciled. Thus, whenever you see disparate groups of people forced into contact with each other (and it rarely happens without some form of force or coercion), trouble inevitably ensues. </p>
<p>As I said, that&rsquo;s the really short version. While you definitely picked the right group of people to ask about this (as opposed to some other sites which cater to the lower orders among us), this forum really isn&rsquo;t a great place for an in depth discussion, since it is heavily moderated and posts come in slowly. Also, we&rsquo;re a bit off topic for this particular thread. </p>
<p>If you want, you can click on my screen handle and we can continue this by email. I have one condition: I am not a spokesman for or employee of American Renaissance, and if you use anything I say in your paper, I insist you not cite me as such or attempt to put my words in their mouth.</p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>We Whites founded this country.  The freedoms, rights, and prosperity that you enjoy were created by Whites.  The computer you are using was created by White technology.  The First World comforts you enjoy  &mdash;  your TV, car, electric lights, air conditioning, medical care, vaccinations, antibiotics were discovered and/or created by White innovators.  And that&rsquo;s just for starters.</p>
<p>This is not in dispute.</p>
<p>If you benefitted from an American education, free breakfasts or lunches, WIC, AFDC, free medical care or any welfare program, this was paid for by Whites (did you know 50% of Hispanics use some form of welfare?).</p>
<p>Source:  Hispanics: A Statistical Portrait</p>

<p><br>
Only 2% of American Whites owned slaves but from American high school textbooks, you&rsquo;d get the impression that ALL Whites owned slaves and desire to &#8216;go back to those times.&rsquo;  This is a ridiculous notion but it is what the media, textbooks and the government tell the public   &mdash;  that we, ALL OF US, are evil, genocidal colonists hell-bent on re-creating the Third Reich.  We want a stop put to distortions about our people.</p>
<p>We are told by the Attorney General of the United States, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee this past spring&hellip; that the hate bill does not protect Christian ministers, Whites, heterosexuals, policemen and members of U.S. military. </p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/yau5mnh" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yau5mnh</a></p>
<p>Why do you think that is?  I and my children, as Whites are not protected by Hate Crimes even though blacks commit vastly more Hate Crimes against Whites than Whites commit against Blacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;between 2001 and 2003, blacks were 39 times more likely to commit violent crimes against whites than the reverse, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Source:  The Color of Crime:  </p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/9msbd</p>
<p>Is this fair to you?</p>
<p>Our concerns are not published by the media  &mdash;  we are called Nazis, haters and Klansmen for even pointing out the unfairness of things that discriminate against us such as Affirmative Action.</p>
<p>We are pushed aside as non-Whites with lower test scores and lower academic achievement are fawned over and offered full scholarships and admission to prestigious, White-created universities while our own White children are locked out.  If non-Whites attend public universities, such as the UC system in California, White taxes pay to keep them open.  </p>
<p>White countries, and only White countries, against the wishes of the population, are being flooded by minions of the Third World.  We Whites are told this is for &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and &#8216;diversity is a strength&rsquo;  &mdash;  when in actuality, diversity creates distrust, violence and discordance when different races are thrown together.  We are forced to pay massive amounts of welfare to immigrants  &mdash;  illegal or otherwise  &mdash;  forced to pay for our own displacement.  If we complain, we are called Nazis by the media.</p>
<p>Is this fair to you? </p>
<p>Television programs show Whites as either stupid, foolish, illiterate, stumbling and hapless  &mdash;  until a non-Whites comes along to &#8216;rescue&rsquo; him from his own stupidity  &mdash;  or we are portrayed as vicious killers preying upon innocent non-Whites. On CSI and other popular &#8216;crime dramas&rsquo; that are &#8216;ripped from the headlines&rsquo;  the races are reversed with the White portrayed as the criminal and non-White the victim!  You&rsquo;d get the impression there is a White crime wave in New York (when the actual case is a black crime wave).</p>
<p>We Whites want the same rights that you and other non-Whites are afforded  &mdash;  the right to stand up and openly advocate for our people without being shouted down or told we&rsquo;re Klansmen.  If you are in trouble, you can call well-funded groups such as La Raza, LuLac, Maldef. Blacks call NAACP, Urban League, $PLC, ADL for advocacy including free legal services to represent them in court against &#8216;evil Whites&rsquo;, things we must pay for ourselves if we are accused of &#8216;racism&rsquo; and at risk of losing our careers.  Even Asians have advocacy groups that will speak up against injustices done to their people.  Who can I call that will defend me against racism and hatred directed at me or my people?</p>
<p>Why are Whites not allowed to form advocacy groups?</p>
<p>We want an end to Affirmative Action, race-based preferences, quotas and any other government mandate which blatantly and openly discriminates against Whites.</p>
<p>We are tired of walking on egg-shells around non-Whites. Any perceived comment, no matter how innocuous, that a White might inadvertently make to a non-White may be interpreted as Hate Speech and we risk losing our jobs, our pensions and our reputations  &mdash;  just ask Don Imus, Trent Lott, Fuzzy Zoeller, Harry Reid (who was given a pass for reasons too long for me to explain) and others.</p>
<p>Yet a &#8216;comedian&rsquo; such as George Lopez can openly say (on The View to Whoopie Goldberg):  &#8220;I took up golf because anytime you hit something white with a club it is good.&#8221; </p>
<p>If a White comedian said anything of the sort (hitting something black or brown), his career would be finished and it would be headline news.</p>
<p>Here is a long list of anti-White hate speech, some of it vile, said openly, for which none of the non-Whites, as far as I know, were ever held accountable.</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/yd55j4f</p>
<p>Do you not find this hypocritical and a double standard?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more, but I&rsquo;ll leave it at that for now and others I&rsquo;m sure will fill in the blanks.</p>

<p>I look forward to reading following posts<br>
o and one more thing i am doing this for a paper in a class called human diversity <br>
thank you </p>
<p></p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for everyone, but AmRen isn&rsquo;t about superiority. It&rsquo;s about Race Realism and the recognition that all races have their strengths and weaknesses. Most people rightfully think that Diversity is a weakness, not a strength. Most people if given the choice would like to associate with their own and AmRen supporters do not like diversity being shoved down their throats.</p>
<p>I personally think EVERYONE would be better off if there were a separation of the races. Africans and their decendants belong in Africa. It&rsquo;s a haven of natural resources and great farmland. Diversity only keeps Africans from building a civilization on their own. I think it&rsquo;s perverse for a Somalian to want to live in a cold frigid place like Minnesota or Maine. Just think of all the time and money that is wasted because someone thinks they&rsquo;re being discriminated against? In a homogenous society nobody would have to worry about offending people on the basis of race and our courts wouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with lawsuits because someone&rsquo;s feelings were hurt.</p>
<p>The United States was found by White people for White people. To think otherwise would be ignoring history. Why should we sit by and allow non-whites to enter our country to take our jobs, take our women, try and alter our culture to fit their own?</p>
<p>All races should want exactly want AmRen supporters want&hellip; a land that they can call their own with the opportunity to flourish without the interference of foreign invaders.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think whites are a superior race, or that any race is such.  Because the concepts of &#8220;superior&#8221; and &#8220;inferior&#8221; are qualitative, and very much in the eye of the beholder.  Therefore, superiority and inferiority are inappropriate concepts for discussing differences between human beings and racial groups thereof.</p>
<p>What does exist are racial differences in various quantifiable factors.  As a measure of central tendency, whites are more intelligent than blacks, and blacks can run faster than whites.   Therefore, whites have a competitive advantage in matters such as scientific innovation, and blacks have a competitive advantage in the 100 meter dash.  However, competitive advantage is not the same thing as superiority.</p>
<p>The reason I am pro-white is because I am white.  While I am glad of the many accomplishments of white people throughout history, it is all irrelevant to me in my decision to advocate for my own people.  All I need to know is that they are like me and I are like them.  I would still be pro-white even if whites were on average the most stupid and most criminal race on Earth.  Nothing more.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure your question shows a misunderstanding concerning people advocating AMREN. </p>
<p>This is not about superiority or inferiority per se.</p>
<p>By the way - I am sure that there actually are racial differences – some are so obvious, that really nobody can deny them (Whose genotype is more appropriate for Sumo wrestling – Pygmy or Maori? You guess.) others are much easier to deny with a media effort (but for the most historical part of Western civilization racial differences have not been denied by the media; only for some decades). But this is not what (at least for me) AMREN is about.</p>
<p>I can tell you:<br>
Again and again - be it by reading history or looking at the world today – one can see that the chances are very high that at those places where this kind of *diversity* is promoted the end of the story means<br>
- rising violence<br>
- declining freedom<br>
- declining prosperity<br>
I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a happy end.</p>
