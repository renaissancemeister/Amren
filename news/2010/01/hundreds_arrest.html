<h1><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2010/01/01/france-violence.html">Hundreds Arrested in French Violence</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Canadian Broadcasting Centre, January 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New Year&rsquo;s Eve celebrations turned violent in regions across France as youths burned more than 1,000 cars overnight and police arrested nearly 400 people.</p>
<p>Car burnings have become a regular occurrence in the poor, immigrant-heavy suburbs that ring France&rsquo;s biggest cities, but the incidents of arson are especially prevalent on New Year&rsquo;s Eve.</p>
<p>The Interior Ministry mobilized 45,000 police during the night, 10,000 more than last year.</p>
<p>The ministry said 398 people were taken into police custody  &mdash;  nearly twice the figure of a year ago.</p>
<p>Such vandalism mirrors events in the fall of 2005, when a three-week wave of riots and other violence shocked the country.</p>
<p>The violence flared again two years later in neighbourhoods outside Paris, following the deaths of two teens who were killed in a crash with a police patrol car in November 2007.<br>

		<p>If the French say 1000 it must be more like 3000.  Their own Islamic version of Cash for Clunkers I guess.  The auto industry loves it and the government is probably subsidizing the insurance claims as bankers are not allowed to lose money anywhere.</p>

		<p>This all reminds of Dee-troit and the Devil&rsquo;s Night. Halloween when the &#8220;youths&#8221; of the area would go on a rampage and burn down whatever could be burned down. This was a popular growth business that we have not heard much about lately. I guess what could be burned has already been burned, and only empty or derelict shells remain. The good old days can be no more, nothing left to set alight? NOT SO IN FRANCE! </p>

<p>If these people are poor how can they afford cars? I&rsquo;m assuming that more affluent people are not parking their cars in the &#8220;poor, immigrant-heavy suburbs&#8221; knowing that their cars will be torched.</p>
<p>It seems to me that if you&rsquo;ve never owned anything, and your family has never owned anything for generations or since time began, then how are you supposed to comprehend the concept of private property and to have respect for property belonging to others?  </p>

		<p>This has little to do with Islam.  Many of the rioters are non-Muslim blacks from the Caribbean and West Africa.  The &#8220;Muslim&#8221; population of France is probably less observant than in any other European country.  The rioters in France model themselves after black American rappers.</p>

<p>I wonder if there is any legal way to strip someone of their citizenship?  If there isn&rsquo;t, there needs to be quickly, as most of these youths are French born at this point.<br>

		<p>The sick thing is most of the &#8220;real&#8221; French have at least one child, or at least some nieces and nephews, and have no qualms about their children becoming slaves in the nation their grandfathers built.  How can any man or woman condemn their own to such a horrible future?  How?  For some coins?  Maybe we need to go extinct if our children are worth less than some money.</p>

First &#8220;If these people are poor how can they afford cars?&#8221; Who says it is their cars that get burned or that the burnings occur in the &#8216;poor&rsquo; areas? AND &#8220;Before any major holiday the French government should load crop dusters with tranquilizers and spray all the suburbs&#8221; No, spray it with cyanide gas and make them all dead! AND &#8220;Why aren&rsquo;t they deporting these people?&#8221; Why isn&rsquo;t the U.S. deporting those same sorts of people? AND &#8220;Every one of those &ldquo;youths&rdquo; should be stripped of their citizenship&#8221; They are probably NOT citizens and they wouldn&rsquo;t care anyway because they know they cannot be deported.<br>

		<p>We here in South Africa know all too well when tempers flare up it does so literally! Then the dancing around the burning object starts-strange way of anger management. But then it is perhaps real good adrenalin boosting to set something alight&hellip;..In our little town the municipal workers marched for more `pay` but soon the marchers get excited and looting and burning started. We even had our water sabotaged (both communities black and white suffered) but the culprits were not jailed. In my books any act of sabotage is an act of treason! But if we as whites fail to pay rates we are threatened with the full force of the law. Our coming  New Age of Barbarism upon us?! </p>

<p>Well, Skip the article states that the car burnings occur in the &#8220;poor, immigrant heavy suburbs.&#8221; My point was if the neighbourhood where the car burnings took place was indeed poor how could the residents afford these cars. I certainly didn&rsquo;t mean to suggest that the car burners were burning their own cars, and I cannot see anyone more affluent parking their cars in such a neighbourhood knowing full well that their cars could be burned.</p>
<p>Furthermore, my dear Skip, your suggestion of spraying cyanide gas over the rioters and car burners is rather alarming to say the least.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Yes.  It is important for Americans to understand that the development of European cities (on the continent), especially in France and Spain, has been quite the opposite of the American pattern.  For historical reasons, and for centuries, their cities have held  disproportionate political clout and enjoyed the lavish expenditure of government funds  (especially the capitals), while rural  areas languished and were neglected. These European cities were  once protected within  walls, the choice location where all the influential and wealthy people lived and had their mansions and palaces and businesses. Outside the walls  (as in Spain during the Reconquest) it was sometimes  no-mans-land, ravaged by bandits, outlaws and war parties, where chaos reigned and you were on your own. Hence, the cities were the choice places to be   &mdash;   for everyone who could afford it.  (England, being a united country for more than a thousand years, internally secure, and not subject to foreign wars or invasions, had its great country estates and rural gentry, and almost no walled cities.  But on the continent, it was the reverse:  the nobility was [generally] concentrated in the cities&hellip;. sometimes, as in France,  by royal decree, where the king could keep close track of them.)  </p>
<p>Europeans today are amazed to see how American &#8220;inner cities&#8221; have been allowed to deteriorate and the riffraff take over, while our suburbs are the nicest places to be &hellip; the reverse situation of Europe, where the  rich live inside the city and the poor live outside it. (Generally speaking, that is;  there are some exceptions   &mdash;    like Neuilly, the wealthy suburb of Paris).</p>
<p>American cities, much younger and later in development, grew up around their railroads and industries. Often, the railroads and industries were there first.  European cities, already many centuries old, isolated their rail yards and smelly, grimy industries to areas outside the city limits.  Industrial slums grew up around them.  The inner cities remained choice real estate for the elite. That&rsquo;s were the palaces were. Today, you can still see the difference the moment you step over the city line. Inside Paris, the streets are clean and manicured, the sidewalks broad and uncracked, the parks beautifully maintained. There are trees and flowers, the buildings are splendid, and money is obviously lavished on making the city beautiful.  Outside the city line, the flowers and trees abruptly stop,  the pavement is cracked and littered, the buildings are less opulent, less well kept.  There are women in veils, men in African robes,  dusky street urchins running about,  hallal butcher shops with their bloody wares proudly displayed in the windows, and the shriek of Arabic music is heard everywhere.</p>
<p>To the privileged classes living inside the city, the &#8220;immigrant&#8221;  suburbs  are on another planet, a place they never go and never think about.  They would have no reason.  They may pass through them on a high-speed train with the window shade pulled, on their way to London or Brussels or the airport&hellip;as they read the international news or study the stock market reports.  Otherwise, they are unaware of what happens there and couldn&rsquo;t care less.  To them, it just doesn&rsquo;t concern them.  It&rsquo;s another world. </p>
<p>One day it will concern them.  One day, perhaps soon, it will explode on the national consciousness in a way that cannot be ignored.  France (despite many warning signs) has not had its 9/11 yet,  but it will.</p>

<p>I might need correction here, but I understand from people who have actually been to London that, b/c of the historical relative safety of Britain as a an island nation protected by the sea from sweeping armies on the march, and because its cities never had the reverence of a Paris, that there are a lot of blacks in the core of London.  And that, even though it&rsquo;s viciously expensive for someone who pays their own way to live in central London, blacks have government welfare and public housing (&#8220;council houses.&#8221;)<br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, I tried to leave out the British Isles from that general observation which pertains mainly to the Continent. There are only 2 or 3 walled cities remaining in England; the others tore down their walls centuries ago when they were irrelevant and the cities outgrew them. </p>
<p>For historical reasons, the Bourbon kings (France, Spain, Italy)&hellip; and the Hapsburgs in Germany too, imposed highly centralized governments with all power concentrated in an &#8220;absolute&#8221; monarchy (in other words, in the capital city). That&rsquo;s where Everyone Who Was Anyone lived. It was the center of everything. It got the best of everything. It remains the same today.  When the French kings, after centuries of struggle, finally got the unruly provincial noblity under control, the latter were required to live in Paris or Versailles and spend most of the year at court, where they were carefully watched. They became esentially pensioners of the state, royal dependents.  They still had their provincial chateaux where they spent a few summer months, but French nobility were basically city people and Paris was their <i>main </i> home.</p>
<p>The British Isles developed differently. They were the opposite.  The monarchy was not absolute and power was more dispersed. The nobility were (and remained) primarily rural people, based in their country estates, with a townhouse in London (or Dublin or Edinburgh) for &#8220;the social season&#8221;.  But their real home, their family home, was their country estate.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been in London in some years and would hate to see it today. I avoid it.  Yes, it is very expensive  (for those who pay their own way!); I think it&rsquo;s rated 2nd or 3rd in the world.  (Oslo is number one   &mdash;   with Zurich, Geneva, and Copenhagen right behind. Do note that ALL these cities, interestingly, are magnets for Moslems.)   (lists vary)<br>
