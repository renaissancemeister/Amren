<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/us/politics/15cncpolitics.html">Blacks Try to Retain Power as Board Race Splits Community</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Don Terry, New York Times, January 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the Democratic Party primary on Feb. 2, Mr. Stroger [Todd H. Stroger, Cook County board president] will face two black opponents  &mdash;  Alderman Toni Preckwinkle of the Fourth Ward and Dorothy Brown, the clerk of the Cook County Circuit Court  &mdash;  and one white candidate, Terrence O&rsquo;Brien, president of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many voters, elected officials and scholars said in interviews they believe that black political power in the county is in decline. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Mr. Hendon [State Senator Rickey R. Hendon, candidate for lieutenant governor] said, &#8220;Young black candidates are popping up because of Barack&rsquo;s influence. The black voter is tired of the old regime.&#8221;</p>
<p>They may be getting tired of the new regime as well. Mark Allen, an advocate of black independent politics, said black voters in Chicago had gone from giddy about the future to turned off by politics since Mr. Obama&rsquo;s election as president.</p>
<p>&#8220;People have been watching all that stimulus money go to Wall Street while their street is filled with their children shooting each other and their mothers and fathers out of work and hope,&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the high stakes, political handicappers predict a low voter turnout for the February primary, not just among blacks, but across Chicago&rsquo;s electoral rainbow. {snip}</p>

<p>I agree. Blacks have gotten everything they demanded and now they have few issues to unify and rally the troops.</p>
<p>The only thing blacks have to look forward to is some white idiot making a fool of himself in public. They need our mistakes to give them strength and power which is why it tick me off to no end when some white guy puts a racial bullseye on his forehead.</p>
<p>Leave blacks alone and they will eat their own:</p>

<p>It must be a big disappointment to them to realize that they still have to work to get ahead and that the mansion, the Cadillac, and the country club membership just won&rsquo;t be coming from Washington after all, as they were sure they would after their bro got in.</p>
<p>I wonder if they have rioting on their minds yet?  If so, can they be blamed?  I mean, a brother is in the top honky slot and he&rsquo;s not doing enough for them.  It&rsquo;s an outrage.  They still have to go to work and punch that timeclock.</p>
<p>Turning to violence in their minds is justified, because they&rsquo;re still not getting very many freebies.  At least not what they were expecting.</p>
<p>As Jeremiah Wright said so often, &#8220;It&rsquo;s an outrage what this country is doing to black men!&#8221;</p>

		<p>The last thing blacks want is to be judged by the content of their character.  Too many blacks have no worthwhile character, they do have thugocracy, or some &#8216;me victim&rsquo; philosphy based on lies.</p>

&#8220;The last thing blacks want is to be judged by the content of their character.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly!</p>
<p>The big problem with race relations in this country today is that white people, for the most part, judge blacks by the content of their characters, and they don&rsquo;t like what they see.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re not committing 58% of ALL violent crimes, they&rsquo;re whining about being a victim, because they&rsquo;re incompetent and can&rsquo;t compete.  And, don&rsquo;t forget, in adition to violent crime, they lead, percentagewise, in most all crimes.</p>
<p>Too, when they&rsquo;re not committing crimes, including 37,500 black on white rapes per year, the vast majority are loud, stupid, abusive, and they demand to be cared for like children&hellip;.BUT&hellip;.don&rsquo;t ever forget, ABOVE ALL, never ever mention any of their failings, because if you do they will tell you how much they hate whites, then in the next breath they&rsquo;ll complain about white racism and bad behavior.  And, as if they are giving examples of their low group intelligence, they will fail to see the hyprocrisy in their cries of racism.</p>

		<p>Well the Dems in Chicago know how to play them.  Blago and Daley and the machine behind those two figured out how to dilute suburban white voter&rsquo;s GOP strongholds by flooding them with section 8ers. This has the effect of removing the rent a mob from Cook county out into collar counties around Chicago, and turns them into a plurality demographic.  So every politician has to pander to them, but not really deliver, classic Chicago Democrat politics.</p>

<p>The Bahamas is probably the best black run country.  Botswana is probably not bad relatively speaking.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s pretty bad news for Handsome Barack!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also bad news for Whites, in a way: it means Hispanic power is really becoming a serious threat!</p>
