<h1><a href="https://my.att.net/s/editorial.dll?eeid=7038786&amp;eetype=article&amp;render=y&amp;ck=">Liberian Teen Charged in Rape Released to Parents</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amanda Lee Myers, AT&T; News, January 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 13-year-old Liberian boy charged in the reported gang-rape of an 8-year-old girl in Phoenix was released from custody Thursday and turned over to his parents as he continues lessons designed to make him competent to stand trial.</p>
<p>The boy, whom The Associated Press is not naming because of his age, has made progress in his lessons to understand the charges against him and how the justice system works, Maricopa County juvenile Judge Shellie Smith said in court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Smith granted his release to the parents on several conditions, including that he continue his restoration lessons, get regular counseling and is monitored by an electronic-tracking device. He also must stay inside his home unless he&rsquo;s with an adult and not have contact with the victim, the other boys accused in the rape, or any children under 12 without adult supervision.</p>
<p>Four boys, ages 9 to 14, lured the girl to an empty west Phoenix storage shed on July 16 with the promise of chewing gum, restrained her and took turns raping her, police said. All the children involved are refugees from the West African nation of Liberia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The boy is charged in juvenile court with sexual assault and kidnapping, but prosecutors are seeking to have him tried as an adult. He must be found competent to stand trial before the court decides whether his case will be transferred to adult court.</p>
<p>A 15-year-old who was 14 at the time already has been charged as an adult, and the charges against one of the younger boys have been dropped.</p>
<p>State child welfare officials have custody of the girl. The girl&rsquo;s 59-year-old father and 47-year-old mother are each charged with eight child abuse counts for abuse and neglect reports dating back to 2005. Those charges were filed in November.</p>
<p>The gang-rape case sparked an international outcry after police reported the girl&rsquo;s father said she brought shame on the family and he didn&rsquo;t want her back  &mdash;  comments a family pastor later said were misunderstood because of a language barrier.</p>

<p>Lessons. Lessons. What sort of lessons?</p>
<p>Just fail to complete the lessons, and no trial? You can never be competent if you fail the &#8220;lessons&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will teach you a lesson you will never forget!!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Of COURSE the kid doesn&rsquo;t understand what the fuss is all about.  In Africa, gang rape is simply a social &#8220;rite of passage&#8221; for young black boys.  You used to play baseball and build model airplanes.  Black kids in Africa rape little girls as a normal activity with their friends.  He just doesn&rsquo;t understand what he did wrong, especially when the father of the girl (also from Africa) blames the girl for the rape.  What I don&rsquo;t understand is WHY we allow this alien culture into our country AT ALL.  What did we expect?  </p>

		<p>A &#8220;family pastor&#8221; said that the father&rsquo;s words about his daughter bringing shame to the family by being forcibly raped were &#8220;misunderstood.&#8221;</p>
<p>The father is obviously of extremely low intelligence and is evil.  The &#8220;pastor&#8221; is evil for defending evil.</p>
<p>Observe White Defense Day the 15th of every month.  On that day do something to build up whites or to oppose anti-white racism.  Wear something white on that day to show solidarity with other whites.</p>

<p>And yet the parents were English speakers!  The pastor tried to claim some Liberian &#8220;regional dialect&#8221; of English caused the &#8220;misunderstanding&#8221;, but there&rsquo;s nothing easily misunderstood about a father saying he&rsquo;s ashamed of his daughter and doesn&rsquo;t want her anymore.  Just more excuses and journalistic pandering.  </p>

		<p>Let me see if I have this straight: the girl&rsquo;s parents have 8 counts of child abuse and neglect against them dating from 2005 and they are turning the girl over to them? The father has also indicated that the rape is his daughter&rsquo;s fault? Where are the child advocacy folks, etc? Can anyone explain this this to me?</p>

<p>On top of that, almost all state DFS/CPS agencies are so abusive that they make the IRS look like angels.  However, Arizona&rsquo;s is one of the very worst, and that&rsquo;s saying a lot.  </p>
<p>However, the reason they returned the children to their blatantly abusive parents is because they were black African immigrants.  Only white people can abuse their children.  Remember, when it comes down to race or a white liberal pet cause, race wins every time.</p>

<p>And the mentally deranged American experiment in forced diversity continues to show great promise of abysmal failure, as more evidences surfaces revealing the stark and awful horror of importing black primitives who are far behind the rest of the world in human evolution.</p>
<p>The Somalis are forming criminal gangs, robbing, stealing, selling dope and killing on the streets in areas of Maine where they were welcomed with open arms by the corrupt politicians and media. </p>
<p>The Hmong are creating chaos in Minnesota and other areas; Bantus are doing the same whenever they can free themselves from taking lessons on how to flush a toilet.  </p>
<p>Haitian dope gangs are notorious for their brutality in murdering anyone that disrespects them, while Nigerians are trying to blow up innocent people, right along with Middle Eastern rejects in the name of their kooky religion.</p>
<p>Wherever Hispanics migrate to in the US there are criminal gangs formed where there were none before, and many of them have close ties to the cartels in Columbia and, especially, Mexico.  In fact, is there one non-white race that hasn&rsquo;t been encouraged to migrate here that hasn&rsquo;t had large numbers of them turn to some kind of criminal activity, domestic violence or cruelty to animals, with the possible exception of a FEW Asians? No, there has not.  </p>
<p>The perfect community we had strived to attain has been brutishly altered into one of degeneration and chaos, and it&rsquo;s mostly all due to importing &#8220;people of color,&#8221; most especially blacks, to add to the chaos and deterioration caused by blacks already here.</p>
<p>Very few of any of them can compete intellectually in a first world society, with the exception of a small number of Asians and Indians, and wind up being a burden to tax paying citizens.</p>
<p>Do we see the same kind of pathologies by Europeans who emigrate to this country?  Do we read about Germans, Irish, Finns, etc., who commonly form gangs, sell dope, commit other crimes, and clog the court system and fill the jails and prisons?  I don&rsquo;t think so, yet Europeans are not encouraged to come here and black primitives and religious fanatics are.  One hundred years from now anybody reading about how this society has evolved in the last several years would conclude that some sinister forces were at work or the heirs of the white founders and builders had lost their minds.</p>
<p>If we had remained a mostly homogeneous nation, we would not have had an economic collapse, caused by catering to non-white failures.  But even if hard times had somehow emerged we would have weathered the storm and very likely been stronger for it.  </p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s true the seditionists, the corporate greed mongers and power hungry politicians, all played a role in our deterioration, it is the influx of third world hordes that finally broke our collective backs. </p>
