<h1>Migrants Leave Italian Town Amid Violence</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Allen Greene, CNN, January 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The message blaring out of the speakers on the van was stark: &#8220;Any black person who is hiding in Rosarno should get out. If we catch you, we will kill you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abdul Rashid Muhammad Mahmoud Iddris got out.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of hundreds  &mdash;  perhaps thousands  &mdash;  of African migrants taken by bus out of the Italian town over the weekend after violent demonstrations shook southern Italy.</p>
<p>The unrest was among the worst of its kind in recent Italian history, said a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have not witnessed such protests in a long time,&#8221; said Flavio Di Giacomo. &#8220;There were several thousand, but I don&rsquo;t know exactly how many people were involved.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Thursday, a BMW pulled up outside the factory, a man got out, shot one of the Africans living there, 26-year-old Ayiva Saibou, and drove off.</p>
<p>A passing policeman told Iddris and his friends it was not his job to help the wounded man, so they called the Red Cross to take the man to a hospital for treatment, Iddris said. Press reports said Saibou  &mdash;  who is a native of Togo with regular working papers  &mdash;  was shot with a compressed air gun.</p>
<p>A few hours after the shooting, a group of about 300 immigrants poured into to the street where the incident took place earlier. &#8220;They put on an angry demonstration, hampering the free circulation in the streets, damaging garbage bins, hitting with sticks and rocks numerous passing cars,&#8221; according to a police report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But police forced the demonstrators to turn back, threatening them with tear gas, Iddris said. Six or seven people were arrested, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The next morning, Friday, the immigrants tried again, playing drums as they tried to march from the factory to Rosarno&rsquo;s town hall, he said.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when they heard the warning.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Iddris  &mdash;  who is originally from Sudan and has been in Italy for about 18 months, first as an asylum seeker and then without legal documentation, and who picks oranges in season  &mdash;  said police arrested another 10 to 20 people at Friday&rsquo;s demonstration.</p>
<p>Italian press reports said the demonstrators had burned cars.</p>
<p>Later on Friday, Iddris said, police arranged for buses to move the Africans away from Rosarno to another village.</p>
<p>But the new location was no safer, he said. Police had to keep locals and migrants physically separated Saturday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Di Giacomo, the International Organization for Migration spokesman, said Italy has many migrants, often from Africa, living in conditions bordering on slavery.</p>
<p>The migrants who demonstrated last week &#8220;were exploited. They were just paid 20 euros (about $29) per day and they lived in slums, the same as slavery conditions. A few months ago in (the southern Italian region of) Campagna we discovered a similar situation. It&rsquo;s unfortunately a reality in many places, especially in southern Italy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Italy is one of the top European destinations for migrants, the migration organization&rsquo;s figures show. More than 3.6 million legal migrants live in the country  &mdash;  6.2 percent of the total population  &mdash;  and Italy has the European Union&rsquo;s highest annual growth rate of migrants, along with Spain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know exactly how many illegal immigrants there are in the country, Di Giacomo said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not controlled in any way. They change the area where they work because of the season of the year  &mdash;  oranges in the winter, tomatoes in the summer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With economic migrants, many of them arrive with tourist visas and overstay seeking work. They can arrive in so many ways,&#8221; including paying traffickers thousands of dollars to smuggle them into the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Italian media have speculated that the Mafia was behind the shooting that triggered the violence.</p>

		<p>The creation of a well paid middle class of free men is the greatest achievement of Western Civilization.</p>
<p>Low-paid migrant labor is war on the contributing Western citizen, regardless of &#8216;class&rsquo;.  The real story here should not be that whites are logically resisting, it is the fact that whites are so otherwise passive.</p>

		<p>Italians are NOT, as a rule, whimpy people. They have the intelligence that Northern Europeans do, with a certain hotheadedness in reserve,that cuts short the speculation that other whites too often ingage in, in crisis situations when action is needed. I grew up in a town that had hundreds of Italians, and I know what I&rsquo;m talking about. My best friend was a relatively short Italian guy that never backed down from a fight, regardless of how big his opponent was. As opposed to this story,Americans,it seems, will just lay down and take it all.</p>

This is what it takes to deal with the ungrateful and unwanted.</p>
<p>How many western nations have the fortitude to take such action? Even if they do, can they withstand the onslaught of condemnation and backlash? Even if they get away with it today, will come back to haunt them later? (Yes, in the form of &#8216;redress for past sins&rsquo;).</p>
<p>Best of luck to Italy. Stand your ground.<br>

		<p>This sounds like it would be a nice place to vacation in. Hopefully this might start a trend that will be unstoppable. As the article stated, when they fled to the next village, it also wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;safe&#8221;. As usual, they have it BACKWARDS. The village is only safe when Africans AREN&rsquo;T there. It would just take a handful of Whites in high places to start speaking out - LOUDLY -<br>
for the dam to break.                                           </p>
<p>Later on Friday, Iddris said, police arranged for buses to move the Africans away from Rosarno to another village.</p>
<p>And just why weren&rsquo;t those buses sent to the border?            </p>
<p>Pope Benedict XVI spoke out against the violence in his weekly address on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;An immigrant is a human being, different by background, culture and tradition, but a person to be respected,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Violence must never be a way to resolve difficulties,&#8221; he said, urging people &#8220;to look at the face of the other and discover that he, too, has a soul, a story and a life. He is a person and God loves him just as He loves me.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Am I the only one that&rsquo;s getting a little tired of these popes telling us what we should do from behind their fortress walls? Is HE willing to step down so a poor black African can become pope - No! Is HE willing to let hundreds of these Africans come live in his compound, at HIS expense - NO! But yet he has the gall to tell the &#8220;others&#8221; that THEY need to give THEIR jobs to outsiders along with giving them room and board at their expense. <br>

		<p>God bless the Italian&rsquo;s in this country and in Europe, they seem to be the only remaining hope of the White Race. Not to condone physical violence but if that&rsquo;s what it takes and is a part of self defense so be it. Remember more than 20 year&rsquo;s ago the Howard Beach incident in NY? mostly all Italian&rsquo;s refusing to be bullied by black thug&rsquo;s. They were persecuted and sent to prison, but they still stand up to these creep&rsquo;s as most other Euro-American&rsquo;s do not. That is why black&rsquo;s will not normally mess with Italian&rsquo;s. As Malcom X and other black leader&rsquo;s have often said &#8220;by any means necessary&#8221;. Sauce for the goose is also sauce for the gander.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t know if the Mafia is involved, but the point is not really the Mafia,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The point is that the conditions for these migrants are so inhuman that they can lead to some violent reactions.&#8221;</p>
<p>NO!  The point is not that these black primitives live in inhumane condions, because they chose to do so when they elected to sneak into the country.  The point is that they should never have left their countries, but they did so prompted by spineless whites in other countries who pay them and provide living quarters.</p>
<p>And so far as living conditions are concerned, did they live as well in Africa?  I mean an abandoned factory in Africa would be a palace for them.</p>
<p>Without looking into the story further, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say the people in these villages were sick and tired of the crime, violence and general chaos these primitives brought with them, and they were determined to remove them from their communities.<br>
And the blacks themselves are so accustomed to whitey backing down everytime they riot they were probably shocked to see the townspeople determined to oust them.</p>
<p>According to one of the most accurate forecasters of events in the world, he is warning that the entire world will be in anti-immigrant mode from this point forward.  He points out that it is happening right now, and with this story on Italians being fed up with the multicults&rsquo; encouragement of the importation of crime and poverty he&rsquo;s right on.  I&rsquo;m just wondering how long the gutless French are going to take having nightly riots 365 days of the year with 100 cars burned each night on average.  Could it be they too will finally draw a line in the sand?</p>
<p>The real criminals are the whites who make illegitimate excuses for these black criminals by blaming their criminal conduct on everything but their own bad behavior and forcing themselves into areas where they are not wanted. </p>

		<p>If these immigrants were being &#8220;exploited&#8221; and living in &#8220;slave-like&#8221; conditions, then why do they want so much to settle and stay in Italy?  They could have gone back to Africa at any point; that they chose to stay shows that their existence in Italy was preferable to their existence in Africa.  The Italians have nothing to feel guilty about.</p>

		<p>Out of the village but not out of the country. This still has all that&rsquo;s necessary for a complete victory by the left. The &#8220;intolerance&#8221; of the natives is on full, shameful display, and the aliens are portrayed as victims (i.e. heroes) and left to continue their destruction in another locale. The same little band of Africans could be used to shame half of Italy, if managed properly, n&rsquo;est-ce pas?</p>

		<p>Southern Italians are not always looked at in a good light. Backwards, superstitious&hellip;and on.. But maybe there&rsquo;s something to be said for not being educated out of your common sense or visceral instinct. They don&rsquo;t want an alien race striping them of their identity* It seems the extreme appraisal of ever higher education in atomising the world objectively&hellip;leads to loss of (self)&hellip;which is after all a subjective thing*</p>

		<p>African illegals in China tried to pull the same riot and burn mess.  The Chinese police were chasing an African illegal for visa violations.  He tried to escape by jumping out a window.  He killed himself.  </p>
<p>His African illegal compatriots then started the same rolling riot technique marching on the local Chinese police station.  </p>

		<p>Interesting that the Mafia steps in.  I would look for them to be exploiters of the immigrants as well as the controllers.  They are tribalists, and so must dislike the immigrants on a &#8220;turf&#8221; basis and a Frank Salter biological basis.  But they are criminal opportunists so they must also understand how much money is to be made by controlling access to illegal immigration.  It sure would be fun to listen in to their discussions on this matter!  </p>

		<p>Notice that the dishonest MSM made NO MENTION of the native Italians&rsquo;concerns, nor gave their side of the story.  All we hear about is &#8220;the immigrants,&#8221; their &#8220;plight&#8221; likened to &#8220;slavery&#8221; (no doubt for effect), thier demands, their wishes, etc., ad nauseum. No doubt the MSM and the vast cadre of Social Marxist Lefties will be howling about this one for as long as it takes to bring Italy to heel for its &#8220;Racial Intolerance.&#8221;  Never mind that the local Italians were burdened (against their will)with a totally alien race who could never assimilate into the local society.</p>

<p>   Quite true, a late relative, born in around Venice, used to be quite dismissive of them. He claimed they knew little of the rich cultural history of Italy. He called them &#8220;Gavones/Cafones&#8221;. However, I think this was truer at the turn of the last century, when most Italian immigrants came to the United States. Most Southern Italians are not as rustic or as backward today.  I think they are fine people. </p>

<p>The powerful are  unaffected, unconcerned.  They are in a state of denial or indifference,  even unawareness, and will remain so  as long as the burning  and rioting occur  in the poor immigrant suburbs.    <br>
 <br>
Until riots come to  the privileged districts of the rich and powerful, nothing will be done and the government will remain in denial.   Such embarassing little details will be swept under the rug. When rioting  finally comes  to the elegant 16th district of Paris, or to wealthy Neuilly,  then there will be immediate  and resolute action.   Not until.</p>
<p>France&rsquo;s pampered  bureaucrats and technocrats   &mdash;   carefully groomed graduates of the  &#8220;Great Schools&#8221;, who run EVERYTHING in France today   &mdash;   are the new aristocrats.   They live in an ivory tower world,  convinced that they are smarter than everyone else and that they know better than you do what is good for you.   When I have asked them about the immigrant problem, all I have gotten is a blank look of puzzlement. (&#8220;Problem&#8221;??)    They are as much concerned about  (or aware of)  the immigrants as Marie Antoinette and her coterie were about the peasants.</p>

		<p> &#8220;I&rsquo;m just wondering how long the gutless French are going to take having nightly riots 365 days of the year with 100 cars burned each night on average.&#8221;</p>
<p>When are Americans going to wake up?  Our racial situation is a lot worse than France&rsquo;s is.</p>

		<p>Here here to our Italian brothers. Berlusconi is a true champion and should receive a medal of the highest order for protecting his people. Good to see white people standing up for their country against the black hordes of hopelessness.<br>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Pope Benedict XVI spoke out against the violence in his weekly address on Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An immigrant is a human being, different by background, culture and tradition, but a person to be respected,&rdquo; he said&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>In case you need to brush up on your Latin, Benny, start with this:</p>
<p><i>Ex Gladio Libertas.</i> Freedom Comes From The Sword. Sounds like the Italians have rediscovered that fact.</p>
<p>Another poster, above, hit on the fact that Haitian refugees are now going to flood the United States, with the accompanying bad acts that caused the ruination of their country in the first place. Hurricane Katrina with French subtitles, if you will. And by the way, we have had a wave of car burnings in the San Francisco Bay Area. Along with the fact that we are starting to see Nigerians moving in here, can anyone connect the dots?</p>
<p>And one last question: Why are we still kissing &#8220;African-American&#8221; butts in this country?</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.  Now is their big chance. The earthquake could turn out to be a godsend (for them, not us). If the US opens wide its doors and its purse, it could be what they&rsquo;ve been praying for.</p>
<p>There will always be earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, revolutions, wars, epidemics, tidal waves, volcanoes and other disasters   &mdash;    both natural and man-made. These will continue to happen, and they&rsquo;re beyond our control.   But <i> WHY  </i>must the USA continue to  regard itself as the automatic repository for all the wretched victims of the earth?   (In many cases these are victims of misfortune that is of their own making.  People who build on flood plains or volcanic faults or mountainsides given to landslides  are simply thoughtless; and people who make war on their neighbors, then lose, have no one else to blame.)  </p>
<p>Compassion is one thing, but making a fool of ourselves  is quite another.  Miss Liberty herself extends the invitation:  <i><b>&#8220;Give me your tired, your poor, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore, your huddled masses &hellip;&#8221;</b></i></p>
<p>Wretched refuse?  Huddled masses?  Such embarrassing words!   Insulting, really.   Isn&rsquo;t it time that poem should be removed from the Statue of Liberty?  That misleading Emma Lazarus poem was <i>never meant to be there </i> in the first place!  It was added to the statue  about thirty years later with the intent to foster sympathy for immigration.   Miss Lazarus had a motive, and her poem succeeded spectacularly in completely distorting the original meaning of the statue which had been a gift  to the USA from France in 1876 upon our centennial of INDEPENDENCE.  It commemorated the establishment of a republican form of government.  The statue had NOTHING to do with immigration!</p>
<p>This misleading poem has given us a false view of ourselves and has caused much mischief. The USA cannot continue indefinitely to be a sponge that sops up all the misery of the world.  I propose that a movement should be started to remove Miss Lazarus&rsquo;  poem and restore the statue to its original meaning: liberty enlightening the world, not a beacon to immigration.</p>
<p>America no longer enjoys the luxury of the wide open spaces that we had in 1876.  We are now the third most populous country on earth, having more than 300 million people to house, feed, and care for.    We don&rsquo;t need any more.  </p>
<p>In the meantime, the wretched refuse of Haiti&rsquo;s teeming shore  should be encouraged to help themselves   &mdash;   at home   &mdash;   not to flee their wretched shores for brighter prospects elsewhere, at someone else&rsquo;s expense.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my opinion.   But somehow,  I suspect the Obama administration will take a different view.<br>
