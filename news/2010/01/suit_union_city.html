			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henry K. Lee, San Francisco Chronicle, January 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Union City police and school officials have failed to protect African American students from a Latino gang, whose members killed a black youth in 2007 at a middle school and then shot at his friends last weekend in Hayward, according to attorneys who filed a class-action lawsuit Wednesday.</p>
<p>The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Oakland, accuses Union City police and officials with the New Haven Unified School District of doing nothing to prevent African American students from suffering &#8220;severe and pervasive racial harassment.&#8221; Gang members were responsible for many of the incidents on campus or near schools, according to the suit filed by 10 African American former students of the school district.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The most serious incident cited in the lawsuit happened in December 2007, when Vernon Eddins, 14, was shot and killed in front of Barnard-White Middle School on Whipple Road in Union City. No arrests have been made.</p>
<p>On Saturday, eight African American youths, one of whom was wearing a shirt with Eddins&rsquo; picture on it, were shot at while at the Southland Mall in Hayward, said the plaintiffs&rsquo; attorney, Pamela Price. No one was injured.</p>
<p>No arrests have been made, said Hayward police Sgt. Steve Brown.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hayward police responded quickly to the incident, while their counterparts in Union City have not moved fast enough to stem violence against black youths by Latino gang members, Price said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Price said her clients are not gang members but are treated as such by Union City police. Officers often ask them, &#8220;What did you do to start this?&#8221; when &#8220;they did nothing,&#8221; Price said. &#8220;To me, that&rsquo;s racial.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>African American students and their families have been told by police that if they don&rsquo;t like the situation, they should move, said attorney John Burris, who is also representing the plaintiffs.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve often wondered why more suits aren&rsquo;t brought against schools where there are numerous incidents of black on white attacks.  That would include a LOT of schools.  Just a while back Asians filed a similar law suit against blacks.  </p>
<p>Whites have got to start wising up or wind up as permanent punching bags who are diverted from getting an education from blacks who are jealous of them, because they can&rsquo;t learn due to low intellect.</p>

		<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. California is at the pinnacle of this race violence of Hispanics v. blacks. This has been going on for years, but now the blacks are seeing that they aren&rsquo;t the &#8220;chosen&#8221; ones anymore. They are no longer the favorite flavor for liberals. Mexicans, Guatemalans, and now Haitians will be the new toys for libs, and to a large extent, the corporate right wingers. They will work for next to nothing, they don&rsquo;t speak the native tongue, and they come from far worse (a foreign third world nation) than does a black guy living in the USA, even if it resembles Chernobyl after a nuclear disaster. That&rsquo;s like sleeping on a bed made of gold compared to the mestizos. How does it feel to know that your time is running out at the top of the hill? It happened to whitey, now it&rsquo;s happening to Jesse and Al. I call that Karma. </p>

		<p>Well, this is the way to go. Civil suit for dereliction of duty. The cops and the city are sued in CIVIL court for not doing what they are supposed to do. Helping to establish a climate that led to a crime being committed by NOT cracking down on gangs, illegals, etc.</p>
<p>Please recall the incident in SF from not so long ago where the man and his two sons were shot to death by the illegal alien gangbanger. SF has a policy of not cooperative with ICE and turning the illegals over. A policy that helped to establish a climate that led to a crime being committed. Sue the city, the police chief, the mayor personally for hundreds of millions of $ and make them take notice. </p>

		<p>I love it.  Blacks kill whites for years and when they are arrested, they scream racism.  Now hispanics are killing blacks just because they are blacks and blacks scream racism. Poetic and ironic.  But bet me the blacks WON&rsquo;T vote for candidates who will demand all illegals go home.  They&rsquo;ll continue to vote for candidates who push Amnesty.  If THAT isn&rsquo;t a pattern that proves racial stupidity and low IQ, I don&rsquo;t know what would be.  Because, after all, blacks think liberals love them, and conservatives hate them.  Right.  It was the liberals and the liberal-light RINOs that inflicted the illegals on the blacks, and us.  That&rsquo;s too deep for the average black to figure out though.</p>

		<p>I often wonder about this issue.  I live in a mostly black/Latino major urban area.  The two groups do not mix or socialize at all in any setting, anywhere.  Among Latinos themselves, there is a big divide by skin tone, as well.</p>
<p>Racial mixers never call the blacks and latinos out on this, indicting them for not integrating and such.  I think, with an ever dwindling number of whites everywhere, that the liberals and diversity boosters need to refocus their attention on harmony, diversity, multiculturalism and racial integration among the Blacks, Latinos and Asians.  Thats three huge groups that currently are very racist against each other.  (Have you noticed that Asians NEVER have anything to do with blacks? Though they will hire latinos for menial labor.) </p>
<p>We need to call the diversity liberals out on this one.  Leave white folks alone.  We&rsquo;re already receding and where will the government get the money for social welfare programs if whites are impoverished and diluted into a powerless minority?</p>
<p>Asians and latinos will not support welfare programs for blacks.  Every latino I know says that blacks get way too many priviledges, and they want more for the latino community.  How will black people fare when latinos are a majority of the electorate? There are fewer and fewer white areas for blacks to flee to.  We need the diversity activists to integrate blacks, latinos and asians NOW.  </p>

		<p>Legal precedent has already been set in the case of police &#8220;failing to protect&#8221; people; the Washington DC ruling was that police departments have no obligation at all to protect anyone.  For obvious reasons, policemen can not be everywhere, so their ability to actually prevent crimes is minimal.  What they do is investigate crimes after they have already been committed.</p>
<p>The suit against the school district might have a good chance of success, however, as the &#8220;in loco parentis&#8221; laws that cover minors while they are at school and travelling to and from school clearly imply a duty of care on the part of school officials.</p>

		<p> Both my parents were born in Union City and I was raised there, I am 40 years old now. The city was once a farming community and has always had a large percentage of Hispanics, mostly Mexicans. In the 80&rsquo;s blacks and asians really began moving in and many whites left. At the high school whites were a minority but the school had no real ethnic majority at least into the late 80&rsquo;s. Ironically the city/school brought in many blacks from the Oakland and Hayward area. As a side note, mexicans murdered the white police chief in the 70&rsquo;s and there has always been a gang presence there. I have left the area and moved my mother out too. </p>

		<p>Just how much hatred over the years (particularly in California with the appalling 1965 and 1992 LA riots), have blacks spewed on the heads of the police?<br>
 - The same organisation whom they hate and revile (eg the targeted &#8216;Black Panther&rsquo; murders of lone police officers) for &#8216;harrassing&rsquo; (ie attempting to control) them, they no cowardly and shamelessly call upon to for their defence.<br>
 - What a duplicitous and utterly, utterly shameless group of people!</p>
