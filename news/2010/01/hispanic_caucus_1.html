			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Legislative Update, Federation for American Immigration Reform, January 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As Congressional leaders return to Washington to negotiate a final health care bill, immigration-related differences between the House and Senate versions may be forcing the pro-amnesty Congressional Hispanic Caucus to reconsider its support for health care reform.</p>
<p>This was the news on Capitol Hill last week as House and Senate leaders agreed to bypass the formal conference committee and instead pass the health care bill back and forth between the Senate and House. Under this scenario, the House would take up the Senate bill and either adopt it wholesale or amend it and send it back to the Senate. This process would continue with the bill &#8220;ping ponging&#8221; back and forth between the House and the Senate until the two chambers pass an identical bill. (TPMDC, January 4, 2010).</p>
<p>This process, however, is immediately putting the CHC under pressure regarding the bill&rsquo;s immigration provisions. In November, when the House originally considered health care legislation (H.R.3962), the CHC insisted that illegal aliens have access to the health care exchange created in the bill.  On November 5, 2009  &mdash;  just two days before the House passed its bill  &mdash;  CHC Chairwoman Nydia Velazquez (D-NY) announced that her 20-member caucus would vote against the final House bill if it included the Senate language barring illegal aliens from participating in the exchange. After a meeting with President Obama, Velazquez told Roll Call that the CHC had &#8220;made it very clear that we support the language that is in the House. We expect that the current language will not change.&#8221; (Roll Call, November 5, 2009). Ultimately, the language did not change, and the bill passed by the slimmest of margins: 220 -215. (Roll Call Vote #887, November 7, 2009).</p>
<p>Despite the CHC&rsquo;s position, the Obama Administration said it would not support illegal alien participation in the health care exchange and the Senate followed suit, passing legislation prohibiting such access (H.R. 3590). (See FAIR&rsquo;s Legislative Update, November 23, 2009).  The negotiations in the Senate were so tense and the compromise so tenuous that Senators warned any changes would risk their support. Desperate to deliver on President Obama&rsquo;s domestic policy priority, Congressional leaders are pressuring House members to accept the Senate compromise.</p>
<p>Thus, the CHC must now decide whether to concede to the Senate language. Last week, Capitol Hill blogs indicated that the CHC was considering capitulating on its position in exchange for a promise from the Obama Administration that the White House would begin pushing amnesty legislation in early 2010. (TPMDC, January 4, 2010).  However, on January 5, The Atlantic reported that the CHC had not reached such an agreement. In fact, a spokesperson from the CHC stated that the caucus&rsquo; position &#8220;remains the same: it opposes provisions in the Senate health care bill that would negatively impact immigrants.&#8221; (The Atlantic, January 5, 2010).</p>
<p>Votes on health care legislation are expected to occur sometime over the course of the next three weeks. Stay tuned to FAIR for the latest developments.<br>

		<p>I think the issue of whether there is a formal ban on illegal aliens getting ObamaCare is a red herring.  Even if there is, there won&rsquo;t be a verification requirement, such as E-Verify and employees, so illegals will get in to the program.  Even if there is e-verify, illegals procure fake documents and fake SSNs, and they&rsquo;ll be able to get in.  But even if there weren&rsquo;t fake documents available, they would still be able to sign up for ObamaCare   &mdash;   Federal bureaucrats, especially of the variety that run social welfare programs, are either white liberals or minorities, and in Hispanic-heavy states, there are a lot of Hispanic Federal bureaucrats and state social workers.  Does anyone honestly think that Miss Ramos the HHS employee in Los Angeles coordinating with Miss Martinez the MediCal social worker in Los Angeles are going to tell Ma and Pa Obledo and all their children no when they come into apply for ObamaCare even if the Obledos have no legitimate paperwork? </p>
<p>Consider this:  It is illegal for illegal aliens to vote.  Yet, many do, and 3 million or more voted in November 2000&rsquo;s Presidential election.  The reason is obvious   &mdash;   The canvassing boards in Hispanic heavy states are run by libs or Hispanics, who won&rsquo;t check immigration status.  And the US DOJ that is supposed to punish such perfidy is always run by left-right Republocrats who want mass Hispanic immigration for disparate but concurring reasons.</p>

		<p>It won&rsquo;t matter one bit if the law passes and excludes illegal aliens from access to Obamacare.  An activist judge will simply legislate from the bench by ruling that illegal aliens are in fact entitled to free taxpayer-funded medical care.</p>

		<p>Many times here at AR, I think that most posters become overly pessimistic about the future. In this assessment, I include myself without hesitation. However, here we do have something to feel and interpret as potentially positive: Potentially Very Positive.</p>
<p>It is noted in the above article that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;CHC Chairwoman Nydia Velazquez (D-NY) announced that her 20-member caucus would vote against the final House bill if it included the Senate language barring illegal aliens from participating in the exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The negotiations in the Senate were so tense and the compromise so tenuous that Senators warned any changes would risk their support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These fools just haven&rsquo;t any idea how to &ldquo;compromise,&rdquo; simply because they &ldquo;think&rdquo; they no longer have to. Unfortunately, the &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; 15 to 30 million alien invaders, have exacerbated the idiocy that mantels their arrogance. Moreover, much like nitwitted and &ldquo;right-less&rdquo; fetuses, they are unable to sustain themselves and risk an abortion of sorts.</p>
<p>We are in an economic crisis, and unemployment continues to woefully advance; in these unfortunate circumstances, promises to all men, lead to nothing for any man!</p>
<p>That is the true &ldquo;strength&rdquo; of diversity, to the power of infinity!!!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!!</p>

		<p>I feel sorry for the Hispanics.  When just about everyone yaps at illegal immigration they &#8220;see&#8221; a latino face.  Not me.  I see East Asian, East Indian, African, and Arab faces - and I just hate it that those groups are even permitted to come to the USA.  I&rsquo;m against any illegal coming here period.  But many Mexicans and other Hispanics are somewhat like slaves here - not all but many.  And to see an East Asian owning a store in the middle of the boondocks just reeks of insanity that we girly Americans would let those inferior people do this to us.  Maybe we are inferior.  All I know is we are sovereign and if we are not a sovereign nation then let&rsquo;s sue for peaceful breakup of the nation.  Why?  Because to continue with the status quo will mean we will lose it all.  I&rsquo;m a savage on the blog sites and I scream louder than all for the foreigner to get out!  Insane you say?  Maybe but its what I do.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what is legislated or not.  As long as we fill our country with poor, third world types, they will get care one way or another.  It is actually more expensive to provide ER services to them than cover them with a government policy.  We lose either way.  Once inside a country, you are really dealing with layers of problems with no easy answers.  I view the entire issue as just another sign of the dysfunction of our government and its approach to complete breakdown.</p>

<p>Elrey, you must not live in the Southwest, or if you do, in a gated community.  Blame capitalists for their low wages, and them for their chronic poverty due to being Catholic and birthing more children than they can support.  They also have a fast generation time - i.e., early motherhood, as a rule.  Latinos do the greatest immediate damage of all immigrants everywhere they mass, partially due to their numbers.  In my case, they burglarized my residence twice, and my professional office to the point that I could not continue business.  I have two nieces who have been raped by Latinos.  I finally left California.  Now, they are moving in all directions.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that before, but you&rsquo;re absolutely right. In fact, the precedent has already been set with <i>Plyler v. Doe</i>.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;In fact, the precedent has already been set with Plyler v. Doe&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;   Simon Jester</p>
<p>Simon:</p>
<p>Although Plyler v. Doe was terrible legislation, forcing US taxpayers to fund the expensive educational expenses of foreign nationals (including college in some states), I&rsquo;d say it was California&rsquo;s Prop 187 that set the precedence:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;California Proposition 187 (also known as the Save Our State initiative) was a 1994 ballot initiative designed to prohibit illegal immigrants from using social services, health care, and public education in the U.S. State of California&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>It passed with 59% of the vote and signed into law by then governor Pete Wilson  &mdash;  but not for long:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Judge Mariana Pfaelzer&hellip; found the law to be unconstitutional. Governor Wilson appealed the ruling, which brought the case to the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1999, newly elected Democratic Governor Gray Davis had the case brought before mediation, and then dropped the appeals process before the courts, effectively killing the law&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This was one of California&rsquo;s death blows, guaranteeing skyrocketing taxes due to unfunded mandates, and led to White and business flight from the state and the huge budget deficit we &#8216;enjoy&rsquo; in California today.  I understand in California, we are 50/50  &mdash;  meaning 50% of the population supports the other 50% through government theft of their wages, wealth and property.</p>
<p>What was it Margaret Thatcher said about socialism eventually running out of other people&rsquo;s money?</p>
<p>This and government-employee unions whose &#8220;pay levels are soaring and reap unmatched benefits, remain largely immune from layoffs&#8221; have ruined the economy.  &#8220;To make matters worse, government employees &mdash; thanks largely to the power of their unions &mdash; have carved out special protections that exempt them from many of the rules that other working Americans must live by&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>A breakdown of the Rule of Law, activist judges, rich, powerful, unassailable unions  &mdash;  have led to high unemployment, exorbitant taxes and a hostile business environment.  </p>
<p>I figure it won&rsquo;t be long now until we have an Authoritarian, Police State Government.  </p>
<p>The Old Soviet Bosses would be proud.</p>
