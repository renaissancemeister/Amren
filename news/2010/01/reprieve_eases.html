<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/06/us/06grady.html">Reprieve Eases Medical Crisis for Illegal Immigrants</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Sack, New York Times, January 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In early October, when Grady, Atlanta&rsquo;s public hospital, closed its outpatient dialysis unit for budgetary reasons, it agreed to pay for three months of dialysis at private clinics for about 50 dislocated patients. The patients, mostly illegal immigrants with no access to insurance, signed documents stating they understood that Grady&rsquo;s payments would end on Jan. 3. {snip}</p>
<p>But only a few immigrants left, and many of those who remain acknowledge that they have done little to explore what they regard as untenable options at home. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} At Grady, where thrice-weekly dialysis treatments cost about $50,000 a year, the outpatient clinic ran a deficit of $3.5 million in 2008. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most of the seven patients interviewed said their plan was to stay put until Grady stopped paying, and then to present themselves at emergency rooms if necessary. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While recognizing that Grady is providing care they would not receive at home, some said it had been unfair to withdraw it. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many of the immigrants said they simply had no plan for when Grady stopped paying the bills.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>These &ldquo;dislocated&rdquo; individuals need to understand something, quite explicitly; as alien invaders, nothing that is taken from them is &ldquo;unfair.&rdquo; They are entitled to absolutely zilch, including, but not limited to: work, food, water, shelter, education, or even health care. It is absurd, criminally absurd, to say otherwise.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Atlanta is &#8220;generous&#8221; with taxpayer&rsquo;s money. Emphasis being on TAXPAYERS!</p>
<p>When are we going to end this insanity and take our nation back from the illegal invaders? The liberal fools stupidly welcome them   &mdash;   partly from their dogmatic belief that we Americans have no right to live better, feel superior to our neighbors&hellip; the greedy business owners and corporate entities welcome them as a source of cheap labor&hellip; people willing to work for starvation/slave-labor wages. Knowing that ultimately we taxpayers get called upon to make up the difference in their earnings potential versus what they need to survive.</p>

		<p> I myself cannot help but feel sorry for these poor unfortunates and certainly cannot fault them for trying to survive as that&rsquo;s the first duty of any organism. That said, We are to blame with our corporate hunger for cheap labor. (ok not you and me but there are certainly groups that love illegal immigrant labor.) By fostering entitlements to illegals though have we not allowed for the ruling elites of these respective peoples country is allowing their most ambitious underclasses to emigrate and not demand more responsive government. I think an approach against  the illegal squatters, invaders or immigrants call them what you prefer is reinforcing oppressive regimes without even the excuse of the cold war.</p>
