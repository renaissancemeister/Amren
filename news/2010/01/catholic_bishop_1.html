<h1>Catholic Bishops Launch New Push for Immigration Reform, Pathway to Citizenship</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christopher Neefus, Cybercast News Service, January 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) will push to get immigration-reform legislation enacted in 2010. The group has voiced support for one Democrat-sponsored bill that grants a pathway to citizenship for people who came to this country illegally.</p>
<p>In a conference call Wednesday with reporters, Salt Lake City Bishop John C. Wester said, &#8220;It is our view, and that of others, that the American public, including the Catholic and other faith communities, want a humane and comprehensive solution to the problems which beset our immigration system, and they want Congress to address this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wester, who chairs the USCCB Committee on Migration, said the church will prod lawmakers take action on the issue, beginning with a postcard campaign to members of Congress and prayer vigils across the country.</p>
<p>On Dec. 23, the Catholic bishops also wrote a letter of support to Rep. Luiz Gutierrez (D-Ill.) for a bill he co-sponsored  &mdash;  the Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America&rsquo;s Security and Prosperity Act of 2009 (H.R. 4321).  The bishops called the bill &#8220;an important first step in the legislative process.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nearly-700-page bill includes an &#8220;earned legalization&#8221; program, more often referred to as a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. It would allow about 100,000  unemployed immigrants into the country each year in an attempt to reduce the backlog of visa applications. It also would exempt immediate relatives from the annual cap on visas. Gutierrez said immigrants have born the brunt of blame for various domestic problems, especially unemployment, and he quoted the Bible to describe their plight.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the religious bent to the latest immigration-reform push, a recent poll from Zogby International shows that Catholics are largely out of step with the views of their leaders on the issue. Conducted in the last two weeks of November 2009 and released in December, the Zogby poll shows that Catholics believe there are too many illegal immigrants in the United States and oppose a pathway to citizenship.</p>
<p>Zogby asked: &#8220;Which approach do you prefer to deal with illegal immigrants in this country? Statement A: Enforcing the law and causing them to return home over time. Statement B: Granting legal status and a pathway to citizenship to most illegal immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>A majority  &mdash;  64 percent  &mdash;  of Catholic respondents preferred statement A, compared with the 24 percent who chose statement B.</p>
<p>In the same poll, Catholics were asked whether the 38 million legal and illegal immigrants and the 1.5 million more entering the U.S. were &#8220;too high, too low, or just right?&#8221; Sixty-nine percent said too high, while just 4 percent said too low, and 14 percent said just right.</p>
<p>Kevin Appleby, director of migration and refugee policy at USCCB, confirmed that the bishops thought the Gutierrez bill was a &#8220;good blueprint&#8221;  &mdash;  and they took issue with Zogby&rsquo;s methodology.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), a non-partisan policy group, contends that the Gutierrez bill is out of touch with prevailing public sentiment:</p>
<p>Asked where the bill in question fell on the political spectrum, CIS Director of Policy Studies Jessica Vaughan said, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think it even falls on the spectrum of bills that Americans would consider to be reasonable immigration reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a massive expansion of immigration  &mdash;  an amnesty for just about everyone, a decimation of immigration law enforcement, and creation of unnecessary temporary worker programs  &mdash;  um  &mdash;  did I miss anything?</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality is that this is not something that most Americans would support.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vaughan said the disparity was no surprise. &#8220;Some other studies in the past have shown that the leadership of not just the Catholic church but all the other mainstream religious groups hold very different views on immigration from those in the pews.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;For the bishops and the leaders, they tend to have a lot of empathy for illegal immigrants here and people who want to come in the future,&#8221; Camarota [CIS Director of Research Stephen Camarota] said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s where their humanitarian concerns are. The concerns of the people in the pews are much more in their community  &mdash;  fellow Americans who face the job competition, who have to send their kids to overcrowded schools and so-forth.</p>

		<p>As a theist, I believe that God wouldn&rsquo;t want religious leaders to get involved in politics. I would imagine that God would want all religious Christians, not just Christian leaders, to not be concerned with earthly affairs (which may detract from one&rsquo;s relationship with God), but instead focus on spirituality and divine matters.</p>
<p>The notion of separation of church and state is a very good principle. It&rsquo;s pathetic that all these bishops deliberately ignore it to force their agenda on society.</p>

		<p>  Unbelieveable!!!!   It was the Catholic church that saved Europe from the muslims roughly 1000 years ago. Charles &#8220;The Hammer&#8221; Martel and the Catholic church turned the tide of muslim invasion around. And now the church is trying to help the invaders. And as usual, its all about money. The &#8220;christian churches&#8221;, both protestant and catholic, have declared war on the white race. I&rsquo;ll ask the question, maybe somebody more intelligent than me can answer it. Must the white race revert to its pagan roots in order to survive?  Must we turn our backs on christian teachings to save ourselves? I don&rsquo;t know the answer, will somebody take a stab at answering this troubling question? </p>

		<p>Based on the way the Catholics Bishops protected pedophile priests,  refused to cooperate with law enforcement and threw up road blocks at every turn, they now have zero credibility.<br>
Now they want to embark on another outrage, AMNESTY<br>
The Gutierrez amnesty bill is AN OUTRAGE, especially at this troubling time in America.  HERE are a few of the bils provisions:<br>
Amnesty for everyone, no strings attached.  <br>
Abolishes all local and state level immigration enforcement.<br>
Weakens federal enforcement. Reduces border security.<br>
Increases legal immigration.<br>
ENDS E-Verify. And on and on and on.<br>
80% of Americans are opposed to giving health care to illegal aliens and this is a real deal breaker to passing Obamacare.<br>
The Catholic Bishops should forget the amnesty bill and start  concentrating on protecting the altar boys.</p>

		<p>In the past they sent missionaries, Priests and Nuns from overseas to bring the word of God to the natives.  Now they bring the natives home to rape and rob the people at home.  Is that what Jesus REALY meant.  What book is that in?</p>

		<p>I watched the sneaky, conniving, Catholic Church sell out its people all my life. They are the originators of letting the worst criminals and miscreants off the hook to act as though they were doing something saintly in the eyes of God. All they&rsquo;ve accomplished was to drive away the most thinking people from their fold. What they&rsquo;ve got left are the goody two shoes tattle tales of Catholic grade school who have not had an original thought in their lives. They will inherit the wind!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a Catholic and I know of nothing in my faith that tells me to want to turn my country into Mexico North. I think Catholic leaders are just hurting church attendance. Even if more Mexicans go to Catholic churches I think many regular American Catholics will stop supporting their church. Catholic are also Americans like me who don&rsquo;t want their country further destroyed by insane and unchecked immigration. My Catholic faith is still strong but I don&rsquo;t give to the church. Why should I support more destruction of traditional America. My church doesn&rsquo;t care. I do.</p>

		<p>As someone else posted on this site, if your religion is pushing this nonsense, prepare a note stating that you will no longer be giving your $$$ to a church that actively contributes to our destruction thru the importation of 3rd world parasites and will encourage my friends and neighbors to do like wise. Then put it on the collection plate - - EVERY Sunday. I imagine after a few Sundays thay might have someone watching to see who&rsquo;s putting that note on the plate and pull you aside later to have a &#8220;talk&#8221;. If they do, have a &#8220;nice&#8221; talk with them, for you will be literally be talking to the enemy within.  </p>

		<p> I think that churches have every right to comment and influence the societies they operate in. That said the congregation certainly should be protected from the abuses of goverment oppression and the church should not constantly try to do whatever is popular at the moment. The churches of all groups should support the rule of law to do otherwise suggests that law is muteable and of all groups christians should remember that God is the same always.</p>

		<p>Hey, y&rsquo;all, I&rsquo;m Catholic - and what I know is the Roman Catholic Church is NOT a democracy and never has been - ergo it does NOT represent the folks sitting in the pews here in the USA.  Most of us want the illegals to be sent home, and if they want to be here let them go through the legal process that ALREADY EXISTS.  Granting amnesty (what is this &#8220;earned citizenship&#8221; nonsense) to illegals is unfair to those who went through all the hassle of coming here legally.  It is also unfair to our legal citizens.  The Catholic leadership needs to butt out - they don&rsquo;t represent us!!!</p>

		<p>This is why Catholics, like myself, do not donate to Catholic Charities. Charity begins at home, and that means taking care of Americans first. I have told Catholic Charities, on the phone, specifically why I would not contribute to them. </p>
<p>Most, but not all, of the Bishops do not reflect what the average White Catholic believes, so there is a great strain on relations between Bishops and their flock. Far too many are too Liberal for me, which is a great turn around from what the Church was, when I was growing up: Extremely strict. </p>
<p>We can thank Vatican II for that, with the Liberalising of Church Doctrine, which never sat well at all, with my prarents, and Grandparents. That is why Traditional Masses are growing in attendance, because the Laity is telling the Church, that the &#8220;Reforms&#8221; are the very thing that is hurting it.</p>

		<p>  Honestly, we see the headlines surrounding the Catholic Church but really if we would like to be honest the various protestant churches are far worse on a great number of areas including immigration and tradition.</p>
<p>  I have witnessed so much left wing and right wing political banter masquerading as christianity in the various protestant churches over the years&hellip;and not just a few of them either.</p>
<p>  A good example would be Barack Obama&rsquo;s church which was explicitly communist and borderline racist to the core.</p>

		<p>What if the National Association of Atheists declared that the Bishops should sell all their worldly goods and use the money to pay for the upkeep of immigrants?  Not a single Bishop would follow that &ldquo;humane and comprehensive solution to the problems which beset our immigration system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is sad day for the Catholic Church in America when non-Catholic Jared Taylor is more Catholic than the American Bishops.</p>
<p>The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) has been on the wrong side of history in a number of crises in American history.  Most ignominiously in the Civil Rights / Sexual Revolution.  </p>
<p>In their craving to be accepted by the elites, the American Bishops have betrayed the faithful.  They should have condemned forced integration, which brought untold suffering to their flock by the complete destruction of the Catholic neighborhoods and the injured and dead that followed in its wake.  They also should have condemned the feminist and homosexual programs of the Sexual Revolution that broke apart families and resulted in the dreadful gay scandal, but they either assisted or remained silent. </p>
<p>As a Catholic I can only point out that the injustice they advocate should be opposed.  They do not have the authority to compel the faithful to obey their immoral stand on immigration.  The Pope should step in and order the Bishops to stop, but as usual Rome acts slowly and for the most part does not want to rock the boat.</p>
<p>The Bishops live in luxury.  The Bishop will not give up their luxury to benefit the immigrants or to improve conditions in the immigrants&rsquo; own country.  No the Bishop demand that others do what they will not; to sacrifice when they will not.  </p>
<p>The Bishops are only taking.  Christ did not come into the world, suffer and die on the cross, so men could become powerful and then take from those less powerful.  Taking what does not belong to you is a sin against the Seventh Commandment.  </p>

<p>That is historically false. To humble the powerful and defend the oppressed has always been an important part of the Church mindset. Today, they believe they are doing the same by defending immigrants because the identify the immigrants with &#8220;the poor&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I am a Catholic myself and am very angered at these bishops after reading this story. The country is in moral turmoil and they lobby for those engaged in immoral behavior i.e., for those unlawfully entering the USA. The Church is losing its white members and the generous financal donations that come with them. Policies like this will not bring them back to the pews. Bishops who support rewarding illegals are little better than liberal secular humanists who they pretend to decry. </p>

		<p>If the Catholic bishops want to bring &#8216;em in, let the Catholic bishops take care of &#8216;em.  As recent articles on AmRen have pointed out, the &#8220;leaders&#8221; of the major religious organizations (for lack of a better word), Catholic, Protestant, and off-brand, favor amnesty and immigration reform while the rest of us are opposed to amnesty, want to send the rabble home, and put up a wall on the border that would make Hadrian&rsquo;s wall look like so many tinker-toys.   </p>

<p>We must turn our backs on the mainstream and giant charismatic churches to save ourselves and our loved ones. Just as predicted in the bible, these institutions have become false churches that are really nothing more than tax exempt corporate entities designed to make money. How do you make money? (Real money, not the pittance wage that you or I earn) You make &#8220;real&#8221; money by being an integral part of the system of the Beast. All Seminaries have been infiltrated and undermined by Marxist ideologues, hence so have the churches that rely on graduates for ministers. This was actually one of their major plans of action right along with infiltrating the higher education system as a whole as well as the public schools across this nation. </p>

<p>I attended a catholic university. The instructor who taught my required course on religion was a lesbian feminist nun (and she wasn&rsquo;t the only one!) who frequently said and I quote, &#8220;All the problems of society are the fault of white men.&#8221; Now, this is where the story gets interesting. By coincidence, there was a minister who lived down the street from me who had attended a local theological seminary. Would you like to guess who taught there? Yep. That same lesbian feminist. We had a very interesting discussion concerning her and these are his own words, &#8220;It&rsquo;s disappointing to say this but if someone didn&rsquo;t know God before enrolling in that seminary then they sure wouldn&rsquo;t find Him there.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen several good catholics posting on this thread discussing how the leadership is out of touch with the parishoners. And has been since vatican 2 (which really was a nasty piece of work!) I&rsquo;m glad to see that you&rsquo;re fighting the good fight and hanging in there. as well as with-holding your money. If they&rsquo;re going to hold you hostage then the least you can do is give&rsquo;em a pay cut! And I think you should. But Catholic Charities has HUGE govmnt contracts to resettle refugees in the US so with-holding money won&rsquo;t stop them. (I wonder why the ACLU isn&rsquo;t suing them for violating church &amp; state???) Anway, with-holding money just means that YOUR money won&rsquo;t go to destroy the country.</p>
<p>Also, there were a couple of catholics who got defensive on this thread. And it&rsquo;s true that there are also protestant organizations who are pushing the same anti-american agenda as those bishops. But that&rsquo;s really no excuse and we have to face this head on. And we can&rsquo;t do that by hiding our heads in the sand. We have to be upfront and 1)admit that the leadership is WRONG! 2)admit that the leadership does NOT represent their parishoners 3)transfer our moral and financial support to leaders who do represent us while 4)trying to oust the ones who do not. There are plenty of traditional/conservative congregations and there is no excuse not to support them.</p>

		<p>The Catholic Church is just selling out Americans.  The Catholic church in Europe is in retreat and its not coming back.  Its over there.  What the white girly priests and their brown skinned sidekicks are doing in America is just to get more numbers.  They want the numbers.  In fact, the idiots probably believe their church can still turn back the tides of Hell.  They are idiots.  They may win the day, but they lose even what little respect I had for them.  If America is sovereign then foreigner out.  Keep shouting - foreigner out - foreigner out.  And keep having little American kids, use your brothers and sisters when you need something done, and keep &#8220;spitting&#8221; in the face our our oppressors.  </p>

		<p>The Catholic Church leadership was infiltrated by communists decades ago, so their support of illegals should come as no surprise&hellip;</p>

		<p>Some points to add:</p>
<p>The Pope is aware of the homosexuals that had infiltrated the seminaries.  That is being taken by removing those responsible. </p>
<p>The Pope is also aware of the secularization of many orders of nuns.  That is under investigation and will be addressed.</p>
<p>The US Conference of Catholic Bishops is undergoing an internal struggle, liberals (who are in control) versus conservatives.  Basicly, this is a battle of the socialists against the spiritualists.  There is an excellent Youtube channel of conservative Catholics leading the battle against immigration and socialism.  See RealCatholicTv.com</p>
<p>And yes, many Protestant churches are being taken over by the socialists/communists.  Just a generation or two ago these were the strongest links in the societal chain.  Now we must line up and fight our spiritual leaders as well.  God help us.</p>
