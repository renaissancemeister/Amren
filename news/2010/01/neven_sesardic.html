<h1><a href="http://philpapers.org/rec/SESRAS">Race: A Social Destruction of a Biological Concept</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Neven Sesardic, PhilPapers, January 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It is nowadays a dominant opinion in a number of disciplines (anthropology, genetics, psychology, philosophy of science) that the taxonomy of human races does not make much biological sense. My aim is to challenge the arguments that are usually thought to invalidate the biological concept of race. I will try to show that the way &#8220;race&#8221; was defined by biologists several decades ago (by Dobzhansky and others) is in no way discredited by conceptual criticisms that are now fashionable and widely regarded as cogent. These criticisms often arbitrarily burden the biological category of race with some implausible connotations, which then opens the path for a quick eliminative move. However, when properly understood, the biological notion of race proves remarkably resistant to these deconstructive attempts. Moreover, by analyzing statements of some leading contemporary scholars who support social constructivism about race, I hope to demonstrate that their eliminativist views are actually in conflict with what the best contemporary science tells us about human genetic variation.</p>

		<p>Claiming that race is no more than a social construction blaringly reveals the low intellect of those on the left, which includes their scientists.</p>
<p>However, I agree with Michael Savage that liberalism is a mental disorder also, but it is the philosophy of naive fools as well.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;theory&#8221; that race is a social construct as opposed to a biological reality is so bizarre and irrational that I would hope that any parent who has a student in any school teaching such sociological idiocy would immediately bring the kid home.</p>
<p>Only an academic, working in the protected environment of &#8220;higher learning&#8221; could invent and propagate such utter stupidity, and get paid for it in the bargain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see what becomes of all these useless drones when people wake up and realize that 4-8 years of what all too often passes for higher education won&rsquo;t even get them a job a WalMart.</p>

		<p><i>It is nowadays a dominant opinion in a number of disciplines (anthropology, genetics, psychology, philosophy of science) &hellip; </i></p>
<p>I disagree with the &#8220;dominant&#8221;.</p>
<p>Anthropology is a highly propagandized branch that does not deserve to be treated seriously, never mind contributing to the &#8220;dominant&#8221; scientific opinion. It&rsquo;s a joke that pretends to be what it is not.</p>
<p>Genetics provides ample evidence of biological differences between the races. Only the most primitive minds there are trying to &#8220;unify&#8221; races by counting genes - equally invalid methodology as an attempt to prove that any two executable computer programs are the same because each of them is but a string of bits. </p>
<p>Psychology is split on the issue: for instance, evolutionary psychology seems firmly entrenched in the traditional perspective on race.</p>
<p>Philosophy of science has about as much relevance to the subject of race as anthropology to &#8220;anthropogenic global warming&#8221; theory (which, as you can guess, several &#8220;leading&#8221; anthropologists are trying to grab as their turf).</p>
<p>&#8220;Race is a social construct&#8221; canard has never been a serious thesis in the mainstream science, with no serious evidence that would support it and quite a lot that contradicts it. It&rsquo;s a classic case of idelogue&rsquo;s fallacy (it&rsquo;s desired therfore it&rsquo;s true).</p>
<p>Although any valid argument that debunks that canard is certainly welcome, let&rsquo;s not lend that wishful thinking idiocy any credibility of a &#8220;dominant&#8221; opinion.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m too cheap to pay to read the original, but it sounds like FINALLY somebody is going to be validating Phillipe Rushton&rsquo;s work.  It&rsquo;s about time.  Race is REAL - just ask any white kid in a predominantly Mexican and black school&hellip;.</p>

		<p>The author is correct, race does exist and is not just a &#8220;social construct&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here are some other shocking revelations: water is wet, the earth is round and the moon is not really made of green cheese. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve often said it: race is real because it can be quantified. The real &#8220;social construct&#8221; is &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is where liberals get into trouble. In history, liberalism emerged in Europe after the scientific revolution. Without science and objective knowledge there can&rsquo;t be liberalism. So when science shows the reality of race, true liberals must modify their positions. This research should start a re-evaluation of all government race policies which assume no racial differences.</p>
<p>This ties in without another problem well known in sociology. It is a theme of sociology that modern societies have trouble setting values. There is a huge temptation to lie about facts in order to set desired values. Now that it&rsquo;s known that race is real, society will have to find another basis for setting racial policies. It will have to be more on a cost-benefit basis so that ignoring racial differences has costs and benefits. If liberals want say, for example, that world peace is achieved better by ignoring race, that might be valid but don&rsquo;t lie that race doesn&rsquo;t exist or that there might be costs associated with ignoring race. </p>

		<p>Life itself&hellip;is a social construct if your an advocate of (missing the forest for the trees). Life is a myth&hellip; if you believe in abstract divisions over common sense. Nihilism is the end result of confusing the mental tools of graphing the world ..for the world. Because breaking things up&hellip;.kills them. For instance, a fish out of water is not really a fish&hellip;WHICH NOT ACCIDENTALLY is likely what these advocates of race denial are in pursuit to effectuate* If these race de-constructionists can have their way they will, through the entertainment industry and other forms of contrivance,(thought crimes etc..)&hellip; constantly EMPHASIZE the grey areas of overlap between the races&hellip;pretending these grey areas constitute the majority of the human condition&hellip;and with enough propaganda&hellip;actually bring this GREY race into reality&hellip;Similar to the way Mao forbade the Chinese to study their ancient past in Confucius and other identity roots, so as to be able to remold them in the communist idealogy. Thus organic Identity must be destroyed before it can be remolded&hellip;Which is what the one worlders are trying to accomplish. As I see it, a proper course is the middle road, which realizes in all of creation, it is grey areas that differentiate the manifold species of organic and inorganic entity&rsquo;s not absolute difference&hellip;.YET these differences are what magnify the radiance of life.</p>

<p>Just today, I heard an interview with a black man talking about Haiti. He said, &#8216;white isn&rsquo;t a color. It&rsquo;s an attitude&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Does that mean there&rsquo;s a black attitude? Can a &#8216;black&rsquo; man become &#8216;white&rsquo; by adapting a &#8216;white&rsquo; attitude?</p>

		<p>The left has wanted to have it both ways. They tell us race &#8220;is a meaningless social construct&#8221; but are none the less obsessed with all things pertaining to race. They love talking about about racial disparities, racial diversity, racial profiling, racial everything. Would they support a society that totally stopped racial bean-counting when it came to academic acheivement, traffic stops, college admissions, criminal  convictions and the like? Of course not, because they would loose their favorite passtime of prattling endlessly about how  evil and racist whites are and how more &#8220;needs to be done&#8221; to correct all these inequities. </p>

		<p>I once heard a biologist say that race was not a scientifically valid concept, and then go on to use the phrase &#8220;population groups&#8221; as a synonym.  She knew the truth, about race and about what could be said about race.</p>
