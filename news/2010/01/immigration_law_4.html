			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicholas Riccardi, Los Angeles Times, Jan. 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Cristina, an illegal immigrant living in South Tucson, recently went to a government office to sign up her children for a state-run Medicaid program.</p>
<p>The boy and girl, ages 7 and 3, respectively, are U.S. citizens and entitled to the benefits. But Cristina, who spoke on condition her last name not be used, was fearful. She&rsquo;d heard of a new state law requiring public workers to alert Immigration and Customs Enforcement when illegal immigrants apply for benefits they are not legally entitled to.</p>
<p>So when workers asked Cristina, 32, for identification, she fled. She now says she has no way to treat her daughter&rsquo;s liver problems or her son&rsquo;s asthma and impacted tooth.</p>
<p>Cristina, a single mother and part-time house cleaner, is even reluctant to take her children to a hospital emergency room. &#8220;I feel so alone,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The new law has terrified the immigrant community here, leading to agonized discussions at schools, churches and community meetings about whether it is safe to get government help in Arizona. The author of the law, state Sen. Russell Pearce, is happy about that.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a hard time having compassion for criminals,&#8221; Pearce said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s about time people started being afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pearce contends that a large number of illegal immigrants improperly receive public benefits, and his law makes it a misdemeanor for a public worker to fail to report one. The law also allows citizens to sue public agencies if they believe immigrants are receiving improper benefits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The law took effect in late November, and it is not yet clear what government services it applies to. Some fear it could mean libraries and fire stations are obligated to report illegal immigrants, an interpretation Pearce said is silly. </p>
<p>He said the bill applies only to a range of welfare, Medicaid and other government aid programs that are not already guaranteed to illegal immigrants under federal law. </p>
<p>But many Arizonans are awaiting an opinion from the state&rsquo;s attorney general on the law&rsquo;s scope and which government workers are obligated to report illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Critics of the law say it creates fear and uncertainty over a problem that doesn&rsquo;t exist. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Experts on both sides of the immigration debate agree that illegal immigrants rarely receive government benefits illegally. Many economists have found that immigrants pay for benefits they receive through taxes, though some studies show a net loss to government. </p>
<p>The main cost to taxpayers comes from the use of public schools or emergency medical care  &mdash;  benefits guaranteed illegal immigrants under federal law.</p>
<p>Also, children of illegal immigrants who are U.S. citizens are eligible for the same benefits as those of any other citizen, such as food stamps.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2004, Pearce, a Republican, helped write a ballot initiative that required state workers to report illegal immigrants who receive benefits. But Arizona Atty. Gen. Terry Goddard, a Democrat, interpreted the measure narrowly so the law applied to only a couple of obscure programs.</p>
<p>This year, as the state struggled to address its budget deficit, Pearce inserted language in the budget bill reiterating those requirements. Many immigrant advocates and local officials were unaware of the move until the law took effect. Its impact was swift.</p>
<p>Jennifer Allen, executive director of the Border Action Network here, said the group has been swamped with calls from terrified parents, like Cristina, fearful of seeking benefits for their U.S. citizen children.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s sent a shock wave of fear through immigrant communities,&#8221; Allen said.</p>
<p>The state Department of Economic Services, which administers welfare benefits, has referred to federal authorities more than 750 people who applied for benefits without proof of legal residency. Officials at ICE have not said whether they have taken action on those cases, but stressed that their priorities in deportations lie with violent criminals. </p>

		<p>And what is the reaction to legitimate citizens of arizona?</p>
<p>Somehow I think it isn&rsquo;t &#8220;fear&#8221;.</p>
<p>And the &#8220;fear&#8221; instilled in immigrants isn&rsquo;t what the article pretends it is.  It&rsquo;s the fear of getting caught doing something really bad.  It&rsquo;s the fear a criminal feels when the police are called.</p>

		<p>Oh my Lord!!! Government workers are going to have to do something that will actually save the hardworking, stressed out, over-burdened American, some of our tax money to people that have no permission here to begin with!! This is an outrage I tell,you!!</p>
<p>The truth is, this is something that never should have even gotten to this point. Americans have dropped the ball for so long, that now, when the government does something that is the most rational thing in the world, indeed, even it&rsquo;s duty to do, then people act as if some miracle has occured.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re afraid now, eh?  Hiding in the shadows and all that?</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t it strange that the only time they voice their &#8220;fear&#8221; is when they&rsquo;re going to be cut off from freebies or ousted from jobs that should be employing citizens?</p>
<p>The rest of the time, when they think they have the upper hand, they run through the streets with the Mex flag raised high over their heads DEMANDING amnesty and talking about deporting all whites to Europe.  &#8220;This is our country,&#8221; their signs say.  &#8220;Go back to Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>But now that they see that such an offensive ploy angered more people than it intimidated, they now fall back as victims, rather than conquerers.  </p>
<p>More responsible for their bad behavior than they are themselves are all the white Democrats and the Republican neo-cons like John McCain and George Bush, who create these insulting attitudes within these moronic invaders.</p>
<p>Well, this year is the year that will make it plain to people who are perceptive enough to see it that the game is over.  We&rsquo;re in no recovery.  We&rsquo;re in a cover-up.  The only people making money are the banks and corporations who have received bailouts, but that will soon be coming to an end probably about Feb or March of this year.</p>
<p>A government reigning over the citizens of a nation that can&rsquo;t provide jobs for its own people is one that is in a VERY precarious position if it continues to encourage amnesty for those already here and encouragement to those waiting to sneak across the border.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised if the tea party crowd doesn&rsquo;t pressure ALL employers to hire only US citizens and punish those who do not, as conditions worsen.</p>
<p>We are on the cusp of changing times.  This time it will go the other way, only it might not be very peaceful.</p>

<p>If each one of those people would have received $2,000 in benefits, which is coinservative at best, this action alone saved the state and more importantly, U.S. taxpayers, 1.5 million dollars.</p>
<p>How can they not justify this?</p>

<p> I guess Cristina is just another one of those Hispanics known for their devotion to family values and Roman Catholicism that we keep hearing about. And wouldn&rsquo;t she make a wonderful limited-government Republican with her high paying job as a part-time cleaning lady!! Gee, if only they (the stupid party) weren&rsquo;t seen as being so dad-blamed anti-immigrant!!! </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m really tired of hearing that illegal aliens are &#8220;frightened&#8221; of getting caught. They need to be scared. They do not belong here. Birthright citizenship must be terminated. This is probably the biggest draw for the lawbreakers. They know they&rsquo;ve committed a crime by sneaking into our country and scream &#8220;discrimination&#8221; when they are caught. Unfortunantely, the PC mentality that runs this country is responsible. We need someone with a backbone, like Eisenhower, who will say &#8220;go home&#8221; and mean it. Follow that up with arrests and deportations for those who defy the order. I don&rsquo;t care what other countries think, this must be done for not only enforcing our laws but for our safety and the welfare of our country.</p>

		<p>One immediate solution is to heavily prosecute ANY employer who is found to have employed illegal aliens.  Couple that with black and minority citizen&rsquo;s &#8220;inability&#8221; to find jobs while on welfare&hellip;.instead of sending black US citizens packing back to Africa, send them PICKING out in Arizona, California, etc.  Replace the illegals with citizens on welfare or chronic unemployment as a condition.  It might help to also mandate that growers pay REASONABLE wages to their employees along with benefits while ensuring they hire NO illegals.  I&rsquo;d happily pay another dollar for a head of lettuce IF all the illegals were expelled and none could find jobs of any sort here.</p>

<p>For &#8220;Immigrant Communities&#8221; read &#8220;nests of illegal aliens&#8221; - taking jobs from unemployed US citizens, and misusing taxpayer resources in hospital emergency rooms and schools.</p>
<p>Any law extending taxpayer supported resources to illegal aliens should be repealed the day after we throw the supporters of those laws out of Congress. <br>

		<p>to #11 anonymous at 11:25 - </p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>I think the whole &#8220;Americans won&rsquo;t do the work that illegals do&#8221; line is a myth.</p>
<p>There have been plenty of recent examples of illegals getting fired from meat packing plants, for example, only to have the workforce entirely replaced by native born folks virtually overnight.</p>
<p>Restaurant cooks, dishwashers and busboys, janitors, landscapers etc. - 30 years ago all this work used to be done by white kids starting out in the workforce. When I was a teenager, I had jobs doing all of them - including meat processing plant work. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with manual labor, and there&rsquo;s nothing like hard manual labor to encourage one to do well in college! This model could easily become the norm again. Especially now that the official unemployment rate is 10%, and the unofficial one is almost twice that.</p>
<p>Even in agribusiness - vegetable picking - the illegal Mexican is replaceable. I&rsquo;ve heard that there is a lot of modernization in mechanization that could be done, but there&rsquo;s no incentive to do it with so much cheap labor available. </p>
<p>The Japanese are quite innovative when it comes to finding solutions through automation rather than importing cheap labor - this country could learn a thing or two from them.</p>

<p>Arizona&rsquo;s version of Prop. 187 had a divorcement clause that denied only &#8220;non-federally mandated services.&#8221; The courts had no choice but to leave much of it intact. </p>

		<p>The real problem is birthright citizenship, which should be ended.  Millions of illegal aliens have dropped their anchor babies and all we hear from the press is about how their legal citizen children are being denied benefits, and how heartless it would be to deport their parents.</p>

		<p>The 14th Amendment was never really ratified, and even if it were, it was never meant to give citizenship to anchor babies.  So no matter how you slice it, these anchor babies are NOT US citizens!</p>
<p>Deport them.  </p>
<p>Let them be afraid.  Let anyone who breaks a law be afraid.</p>
