			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shaila Dewan, New York Times, January 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The South has become the first region in the country where more than half of public school students are poor and more than half are members of minorities, according to a new report [to be released on Thursday by the Southern Education Foundation, a nonprofit group based here that supports education improvement in the region].</p>
<p>The shift was fueled {snip} [by] an influx of Latinos and other ethnic groups, the return of blacks to the South and higher birth rates among black and Latino families {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Four of the 15 states in the report  &mdash;  Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas  &mdash;  now have a majority of both low-income and minority pupils. Only one, Virginia, has neither.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More minority students in a district does not mean that classrooms are more integrated, said Richard Fry, a senior research associate with the Pew Hispanic Center, whose research shows that most white children in the South attend predominantly white schools and an even higher percentage of black and Hispanic children attend predominantly minority schools.</p>
<p>Southern schools are far more segregated now than they were at the height of integration in the &rsquo;70s and &rsquo;80s, a period that saw a narrowing of the achievement gap, said Gary Orfield, the co-director of The Civil Rights Project/Proyecto Derechos Civiles at U.C.L.A. {snip}</p>

		<p>Another reason why public schools in the South are getting more black is that a lot of whites are in private schools or are homeschooled.  </p>
<p>This is the inlet used to denounce the South   &mdash;   i.e. its lower education quality and its higher crime rate.  That&rsquo;s because it is so heavily black.</p>

<p>That would be because, most whites still love their children more than they do, or ever will, this nebulously &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; thing called diversity. Moreover, I would guess that certain schools are not just &ldquo;predominantly minority schools,&rdquo; but predominately black or Hispanic; if not, then there is probably an officially &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; level of racial tension and violence between these two groups of unquestionably &ldquo;peaceful&rdquo; innocents of color. </p>
<p>Integration, like all abnormal Marxist social engineering constructs, is not about bettering anyone; it is simply about destroying the obviously advanced and making it as miserable as, or &ldquo;equal&rdquo; with, the perpetually defective.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>When I was a child in Louisiana most of the kids in my middle class neighborhood went to some sort of private school. By the time that we all got to high school about half of the private school kids were in the mostly White public high school. It is also true that schools were still pretty segregated but it was more due to  neighborhood choice. What has happened now in the next town over is that a large mostly black high school was closed and the kids sent to the White high school close to the working class neighborhood, making it majority black.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe it.  Not unless &#8220;the South&#8221; includes California, Nevada, New Mexico, Hawaii, and the other states colored dark blue on the map in the article this page links to.  The article isn&rsquo;t even self-consistent, which leads me to believe their intended audience is people not smart enough to be able to think through what they read.  </p>
<p>View <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/states/" rel="nofollow">https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/states/</a> if you want more detailed information about the racial balance in public schools.  It&rsquo;s definitely true that there are some states where white students are less than 50% of the public school population even if they are well over 50% of the total state population, but we are nowhere near the day when &#8220;the South&#8221; by any reasonable definition of the term will have a nonwhite majority in its public schools.</p>

		<p>It will be interesting to see the reaction of these non-white families to the continuing decrease in the economic picture overall.  </p>
<p>The increase in the stock market tells us only that downsizing, temporary stimulous money/bailouts, and work force cutbacks have put several corporations in the black&hellip;.BUT ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE.  Take note that the temporary increase in the stock market has very little to do with the economy in its entirety.</p>
<p>How many of these &#8220;immigrant&#8221; families will be staying and how many will be returning home and taking their brats with them?  It&rsquo;s hard to say, but the situation will soon reach extremely serious concerns at all levels of the government, which will mean much of the social net will not be funded.</p>

<p><br>
Actually, a lot of low SAT scores in the South are due to the Southern school districts desperation policies (translation: fear of Federal Court) of social promotion of minorities to the 10th/11th grade where SAT exams are given. South Carolina, however is a notable exception to this political pathology.<br>

		<p>As a former teacher in 2 local public school districts, I can tell you that without question, both of these districts are primarily Hispanic and secondarily black.  White kids who attend public schools in my part of SoCA literally take their lives in their hands, and most white parents are not willing to take that risk.  Hence private schools (here, mostly Catholic) and home schooling!!  My nephew and his wife, who teaches on a shared job in a public school district in the Central Valley of CA, homeschool their 4 boys, each of whom is far above his grade level.  The oldest at age 11 tested out of the public high school exit exam in every subject except math.  So like it or not, home schooling does a MUCH better job than public schooling, provided the parents supplement their own efforts by hiring a college student to teach their kids a couple of days each week.  I suspect this article is 100% correct in its estimates of racial representation in schools in the various states.  To &#8220;Youth&#8221; - you may have energy, but us older folks have experience and wisdom.  Been there done that!</p>

		<p>Do not be fooled by stats. In the South more people homeschool or move to keep their children out of minority &#8220;run&#8221; schools. We moved our kid out of 1st grade when his school turned dark and suddenly had gangs, etc. Yes gangs in elementary school! Two years earlier the school was majority white and a stellar school. It changed that fast! We just moved in a case of &#8220;white flight&#8221; to protect our family. Say what you want but us &#8220;southerners&#8221; are not as stupid as we are portrayed! :)</p>

		<p>If I could know that my White child would be safe in an integrated school, I would send him there, but I know otherwise. If I could be assured that the curriculum would not be dumbed down for a population whose median IQ is around 85, I would send him there. So many families have opted out of the public school system, and at a tremendous expense, because they know that blacks are too dangerous to be around, and that there are no repercussions for bad behavior within the school. Unfortunately, too many White families don&rsquo;t make enough to send their kids to a private school, or get by on one income so that their kids can be homeschooled. </p>

		<p>More than anything, there&rsquo;s one thing we parents must do. We need to counter the constant propaganda pumped into our youngsters by the Public Brainwashing (School) System. To teach our offspring to give lip service; but not BELIEVE the racial unity, racial equality slop stuffed into them by liberal teachers. That the term &#8220;liberal&#8221; is tantamount to the term &#8220;fool&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Southern schools are the most segregated places on Earth except Protestant Churches.They are segregated by social class not race.If your kid has an IQ over 115, he will be placed in advanced classes. A few black kids or Hispanics make the grade but most will be Asians,the children of college educated Wasps, and Jews. These classes go to lunch at times different to the other kids and get out at different times so they are not exposed to the violence and brutality of white trash, 80 IQ blacks and Hispanics born in New York City. A smart white kid gets as good an education as most kids in fancy prep schools. College graduation rates are equal for both groups. Every body else swims in a multi-cultural sewer that resembles Dante`s 7th level of Hell. When these kids get out they are only good for wearing hair nets or Kevlar Helmets as they have been baby sat since the 8th grade. They achieve nothing because nothing is expected of them.<br>

		<p>The only genocide in history where the victims are complicit, or 90% of them are. We must separate now or we will be destroyed, forever. The amount of miscegenation that is going on today is impossibly high. I think within 10 years the true white population will be around 30-35%. Worldwide, it will dip, because of miscegenation and deliberate importation of non-whites.</p>

		<p>The most important skill we can teach our youth is how to survive in a tough world.  This skill overides our desire to fair and compassionate to other types of people.  I feel sorrow for the typical black child in a dysfuntional school but do I want to sacrifice my child in that environment.  No and most of my northern brethren think in similar terms.  </p>
<p>Here in the heart of Georgia a typical SAT score for the 3 part test (out of a perfect score of 2400) for a dysfuntional black school say in Macon Georgia is about 1100.  Heck they give you 600 points for signing your name.  At the prestigious and costly school of Westminister Academy in Atlanta the average SAT score for the SAT is about 1900 points.  Go figure.  That is why you will never see in the public newspapers a comparison of private school SAT scores vs public school SAT scores.  It is just too embarressing.</p>
<p>My northern brethren when not putting down the southern whites<br>
as being hillbillies and rednecks operate in the same way as I do.   They want their kids to survive in a tough world and when their schools get too dysfunctional they pull their kids out eventually.  Both the northern and southern whites has no illusions about what constistutes a dysfunctional school&hellip;&hellip;.If you have a lot of gangbangers there then not a whole lot of learning takes place.  </p>
<p>We will do whatever it takes to protect out children and their prospects for the future and then goes for many black parents who see the situation accurately and are able to pull their kids out of dysfunctional schools such as in Chicago and Washington D.C..<br>

		<p>Sometimes I wonder why there is so little information about the impact on white children when their school transform rapidly into &#8220;majority minority.&#8221;  I know there is a book entitled, &#8220;An Unexpected Minority.&#8221;  I bought it and read it and there were a few very thoughtful episodes in there.  It is, of course, a very rare book to find.  (It cost me something like $100)</p>
<p>The book did a case study in a school in which whites were an extreme minorty.  Here are some of the points from the book:</p>
<p>1.  The teachers, regardless of color, always preferred the white kids because they were the only ones who behaved in class.  The black teachers all had problems with the black kids.</p>
<p>2.  The white students in general were very cowed down and mostly kept to themselves.  They seemed to exist on the edges of school life and even spoke in lower tones for fear of attracting attention.</p>
<p>3.  The black and hispanic kids were lacking in self-control and insulted each other liberally.  A few white boys tried to act black, but were not taken seriously by the &#8220;majority minority&#8221; kids.  </p>
<p>4.  The whites outperformed the rest but remained low key.  White girls were particularly quiet.</p>
<p>5.  The white school staff kept waxing nostalgic on how good the school was in previous years.  Hint. Hint.</p>
<p>A dramatic scene in the book was a walk through the hall that showed class photos year to year.  Everything was white until something like five years ago when the color scheme of the students changed rapidly.</p>
<p>Funnt thing is, this book was written by a liberal and he tries to make excuses here and there, but the overall tone is inescapably sad.</p>

		<p>I believe that most families that say that they cannot home school have not made the sacrifices needed. For example if you have two late model cars with payments, a huge screen TV and all of the other toys and are making payments on all of them your priorities are skewed. Just paying cash for cheaper cars would give you enough for private school tuition or to homeschool. Is it worth it to have your kids beaten or otherwise abused and have the teachers not willing to do anything so as to appear racist. This sort of thing happened to my cousin in the early 70&rsquo;s, she was beaten viciously by a group of black boys that had hidden in the girls bathroom. Her parents immediatly removed her to the school that their church had started.  </p>

		<p>If you boil things down&hellip; there&rsquo;s two ways of failing in this world&hellip;Arrogance and Apathy. Humble dilligence is the road to satisfaction. The rules are not new&hellip; The Cains of this world will always be trying to drag down the Abels And Tyrants will repress the vulnerable. In the long of it these are the roads to failure but they are by no means what distinguish the races. All groups have those that take the middle road of Honor as well as  those that fall to the left or right. This being said I think we whites can see that we for most part should maintain our Identity because not only virtue but numbers matter in the practicle world. I think if we look closely at the difficult dilema&rsquo;s we find ourself in we will find somewhere we had our hand in it. As I see it we should take these lessons as a just chastisement, be grateful and learn from them. Just my thoughts.</p>

		<p>Can you blame the white parents for doing what they can to protect their children? Maybe they would like four, but can only afford two and be able to live in a decent area. How many of those white students who attended the fully integrated schools in the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s are now parents who don&rsquo;t want their kids to go through the idiocy they were forced to contend with? Southerners are not stupid as they are always portrayed on tv. </p>
<p>Here in the Indianapolis area, the differences between the &#8220;doughnut county&#8221; schools and the Indianapolis public schools gives you a pretty good idea of what can be in a predominantly white school. Few discipline problems, reasonably decent SAT/ACT scores, etc. Prior to Unigov, whenever the city if Indianapolis annexed an area, they took the school(s) in under the jurisdiction of IPS. In 1967, with the implementation of Unigov, that froze the borders of IPS. In that year they had about 100,000 students, mostly white. Now there are about 35,000 and less than 20% white. </p>
<p>The surrounding counties can thank or curse their growth due to a JFK appointee who determined that the Indianapolis public schools were operating in an unconstitutional manner. At first, everyone who could bailed out to the townships. Indianapolis has 11 public school districts for a 400 sq mile county. Then when busing was mandated, the surrounding counties began experiencing massive growth. </p>
<p>Once you are out of Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, and Gary, most of the state is pretty white. </p>
<p>This is from the local fish wrap, aka, the Indianapolis Star. They don&rsquo;t post demographic data, but you can pretty quickly get an idea and cross reference a city or area on wikipedia. </p>

At least 2 out of 5 white children in my county are being educated outside the public [welfare] school system. Soon, the only children in public schools will be the same ones on welfare in section 8 housing and on Medicaid. Public high school diplomas will be worth zilch.</p>

		<p>Hey it is me again, after not posting on here for a while.  Anyways, I am a Southerner and I am very proud to be a Southerner.  This article speaks volumes.  </p>
<p>I am sick of Northern liberal whites turning their noses down on the South while acting as if blacks are equal to whites. I am sick of white &#8220;hillbillies&#8221; and &#8220;rednecks&#8221; getting made fun of in the most hateful and vile ways imaginable by our media while Third World peoples are glorified. </p>
<p>I am sick of white Northerners telling us how to live down here while they stay up in their 100% white neighborhoods in Maine and elsewhere.  </p>
<p>I am sick of Northern liberal whites moving South and turning states such as North Carolina blue, and inflicting their socialist viewpoints on the rest of us down here. They are getting themselves into shaky territory, that is for sure. </p>
<p>Mind your own business and leave us alone!</p>
<p>No, I am not trying to be divisive, nor do I want to be.  I am sorry.  I have had enough from white Northern liberals.  They have shown more hatred towards my people than anyone can even imagine.  They have inflicted policies on the South that have destroyed the beloved region for good.  We were doing things just fine down here before Reconstruction and Integration.  </p>
<p>Please, go back to your coffee shops in New Hampshire and discuss how to be green, and let the rest of us down here go sit in our barbeque houses and discuss guns and God!</p>

<p>You and your sources are wrong.</p>
<p>Europe = 700 million + whites</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand = 22 million whites</p>
<p>South Africa = 4.5 million whites</p>
<p>Latin American = at least 100 million whites (of European descent).  That number is probably 150 million +, but let&rsquo;s be conservative.</p>
<p>United States = 190 million whites (after subtracting Arabs, etc.)</p>
<p>Canada = 25 million+ whites</p>
<p>Total white population of European descent is at a minimum 1.041 billion</p>
<p>World population = 6.7 billion, thus total world population of European ancestry (i.e. white) is at least 15.54 % of the world&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>What that helpful?</p>

		<p>&#8220;I think within 10 years the true white population will be around 30-35%.&#8221;</p>
<p>How is that even possible?  At a minimum, the current white population (of Euro descent) in the US is around 190 million.  If in 10 years the US population is around 325 million, then white % of the US pop will be at 58%.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how you come up with your numbers. </p>

<p>Only to the gullible.</p>
<p>For instance, your Latin American and U.S figures are substantially off. That happens when you rely on so-called &#8220;official&#8221; data. For example, Brazil is at best only one-third white. And the white population of the US (European descended only) is 175 million, not 190 million.<br>
 <br>
Furthermore, Europe is presently home to more than 50 million Muslims and that does not take into account huge numbers of non-Muslim Africans, Asians and increasing numbers of Latinos(Spain, Switzerland, et al). When Turkey joins the EU another 70 million non-whites will be added.</p>
<p>European descended whites represent well under 10% of the entire world population, which is now approaching 7 billion.<br>
Dont agree? Seriously research it.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Southern schools are the most segregated places on Earth except Protestant Churches.They are segregated by social class not race.If your kid has an IQ over 115, he will be placed in advanced classes. A few black kids or Hispanics make the grade but most will be Asians,the children of college educated Wasps, and Jews.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luckily for me, this is a true statement; at least it was true when I was a schoolboy, 1965-1976.  &#8220;Bussing&#8221; started when I was in eighth grade, yet due to testing etc. I never saw any blacks in any classes other than P.E. &amp; Health, except for some AA teachers.</p>
<p>Of course, back then, there were basically zero asians in Tennessee, or &#8220;hispanics&#8221;.  Jews were also rare &amp; not really a part of anyone&rsquo;s concern, one way or the other.</p>

<p>The current non-Hispanic white population of the US is 200 million.  At worse, there may be 10 million Arabs and other misc groups that are part of that 200 million, but not even close to 25 million.  But for argument&rsquo;s sake, I will use 175 million.</p>
<p>As far as Europe, I made an adjustment for Muslims, etc.  Europe&rsquo;s current population is close to 740 million.  For argument&rsquo;s sake, I will drop the white number down to 675 million.</p>
<p>As far as my 100 million # in Latin America, let&rsquo;s see if we can agree.  </p>
<p>Argentina = 25 million whites </p>
<p>Uruguay = Over 3 million whites</p>
<p>And using your Brazil data (not mine, but yours), then add another 60+ million whites.</p>
<p>Include white minorities in Chile, Columbia, Venezuela, etc. then we are over 100 million using YOUR strictest definition of white (those of European descent).</p>
<p>So using the current world population of 6.7 billion, the % is 14.8 after revising the total white population down to 991 million.</p>
<p>Now if you&rsquo;re using sub-groups (such as Nordic/northern European), then I would imagine the total population is around 500 million (around 7% of the world&rsquo;s population).</p>
<p>  But if you&rsquo;re going to use sub-groups (which would make everyone on the planet part of a small minority – even Africans are part of racial sub-groups), then using your definition of white (i.e. northern European), then the total white population in the US is probably around 150/160 million (not 175).  </p>
<p>Also, Turkey&rsquo;s population is not included in the current European population.</p>
<p>Do you not agree?</p>

		<p>This is off topic but will probably come as a big shock to all Southerners and Mid-Westerners but the highest achieving schools in California are only about 10-20 percent white and 80 percent minority or &#8220;children of color&#8221;. I know this sounds unbelievable but there are schools where &#8220;white kids&#8221; are seen as the &#8220;slow students&#8221; or &#8220;party kids&#8221; while the minority kids are seen as &#8220;studious&#8221; and &#8220;hard working&#8221; and &#8220;intense&#8221; and &#8220;goody-two shoes&#8221;.</p>
<p>The secret is the minorities are ALL ASIAN- BOTH SOUTH ASIAN AND EAST ASIAN- INDIANS (DOT NOT FEATHER), CHINESE, KOREANS, JAPANESE, VIETNAMESE</p>
<p>Please do a google search on &#8220;Cupertino School District&#8221; and stop lumping all &#8216;non-whites&rsquo; as low IQ criminals.</p>

<p>Very well put. There are quite a few of those arrogant Yankees on this site. They come down South because they have soiled their own nest with their socialist policies. It is because of them that Civil Rights was able to take a hold. If they cared about minorities as much, then they would have been welcoming them with open arms. Instead, Civil Rights was a defensive action, to give Blacks rights where they are so that Blacks would not leave the South and come up North to litter their coffee houses.</p>
