<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-latinamerica/20100109/LT.Mexico.US.Migration/">Mexico Says Immigration Reform Unlikely in 2010</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Stevenson, Comcast News, January 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mexico&rsquo;s ambassador to the United States said Friday he expects immigration reform is unlikely to pass in that country in 2010 because of unemployment and midterm elections.</p>
<p>In an unusually frank assessment, Ambassador Arturo Sarukhan said Mexico will continue its quiet, &#8220;under the radar&#8221; lobbying for a reform that would benefit the estimated 11.8 million Mexicans living in the United States. A large percentage are undocumented.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If the (U.S.) economy grows, but there continues to be the unemployment and the job losses that occurred in the United States in 2009, it is politically impossible for the Republicans or the Democrats, as much as they might be interested .&nbps;.&nbsp;. to put an integrated immigration reform on the table,&#8221; Sarukhan said.</p>
<p>Sarukhan also said past pronouncements on the issue by Mexico may have done more harm than good.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having spoken about it publicly at times in the past .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has done a great deal of damage to our countrymen and our allies in the United States,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Sarukhan said a general amnesty that would automatically legalize undocumented migrants &#8220;cannot be the solution,&#8221; because &#8220;the radical conservative wing in the United States would immediately mobilize to torpedo it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said a more realistic goal is a program of temporary work visas and a &#8220;regularization process&#8221;  &mdash;  presumably, what has been called &#8220;earned legalization&#8221; involving fines or other qualifying factors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Daniel Hernandez Joseph, director of overseas citizen protection services for Mexico&rsquo;s Foreign Relations Department, told reporters that anti-immigration rhetoric &#8220;has permeated in (U.S.) society&#8221; and that anti-immigration groups in the United States currently &#8220;feel empowered.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I read something a few years ago about the fact that the birthrate in Mexico dropped sharply about 18 or 20 years ago.I really hope that is true.It means that far fewer Mexicans will be entering the Mexican work force strarting in 2010, and less of them will have to come to Gringoland to get jobs, steal,collect recyclables, sell drugs, or collect welfare benefits.Does anyone else know anything about this?</p>

		<p>Amnesty?!?!? Illegal immigration is a federal crime!!!</p>
<p>Amnesty for illegal aliens should only mean that those who surrender peacefully to the authorities and leave the country may avoid a felony arrest, a felony conviction, and imprisonment under the law. Amnesty like the democrats and republicans are clamoring for would mean rewarding felons!</p>
<p>Of course, the politicians in Washington see the illegals as a vehicle to funnel more money from White Americans through the illegals and back to their personal bank accounts in Washington.</p>
<p>Everyone knows about the free education, free social benefits, property loan preferences, hiring preferences, housing preference, Social Security benefits, Medicare benefits, health care benefits, and voting rights given to illegals. So, not only do the Washington politicans look the other way, they encourage illegal alien rights before the rights of American citizens!</p>
<p>If that does enrage White Americans more than anything ever has in our adult lives, what will?</p>
<p>They are ILLEGAL ALIENS! They are committing a felony every second they are here! And the government REWARDS them with tons of free benefits and special protections under OUR laws?!?!?! WTH? This nation&rsquo;s government is corrupt to the max! </p>
<p>Under Title 8 Section 1325 of the U.S. Code, &#8220;Improper Entry by Alien,&#8221; any citizen of any country other than the United States who:</p>
<p>Enters or attempts to enter the United States at any time or place other than as designated by immigration officers; or </p>
<p>Eludes examination or inspection by immigration officers; or </p>
<p>Attempts to enter or obtains entry to the United States by a willfully false or misleading representation or the willful concealment of a material fact; <br>
has committed a federal crime.</p>
<p>Violations are punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment for up to six months. Repeat offenses can bring up to two years in prison. Additional civil fines may be imposed at the discretion of immigration judges, but civil fines do not negate the criminal sanctions or nature of the offense.</p>

		<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m sure Mexico will continue to push for amnesty, as they will continue to push drugs. As for Americans that won&rsquo;t lift a finger to fight this, &#8220;stupid is as stupid does&#8221;, or &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t&#8221;, in the case of many Americans.</p>

		<p>This is why, in spite of the links between the American Republican Party and Mexico&rsquo;s Partido Acción Nacional (PAN), translate:  National Action Party, (or maybe because of the links), I don&rsquo;t want the PAN to win elections.  I want leftist parties winning national elections all over Indoamerica.  With PAN&rsquo;s close links to Republicans, PAN wants to move disgruntled Mexicans to the United States for good.  Rs and its big business masters get cheap labor, while the PAN rids themselves of Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI, the main leftist party) voters.  It&rsquo;s a win win for both sides, and the new immigrants standard of living improve.  We&rsquo;re the big losers.</p>
<p>Mexican and Latin American leftist parties want their people to stay there, for just the same reason:  To keep them in power and the center-right parties out of power, and fodder for insurrection to topple the white (or white-ish) elite.  This is why I don&rsquo;t bash Hugo Chávez to the extent that most conservatives and neo-cons do.  At least he wants to keep Venezuelans in Venezuela.  If his opposition comes to power, then they&rsquo;d gang up with the Republicans just like PAN does, and we&rsquo;ll lose.  I know Chávez hearts AQ, China, et al., but I think it&rsquo;s only to spite the United States.  An American administration that either supports him or his neutral will satisfy him, and he&rsquo;ll stop supporting AQ and China.</p>

		<p>It is even less likely to pass in 2011, since many of the left-wing congresscritters in favor of amnesty are going to be voted out of office by the constituents they have infuriated.</p>

		<p>A &#8220;guest worker&#8221; program might, MIGHT, be acceptable, as long as it is clear that at the end of the day, Mexican migrant workers GO HOME and do not ever become US citizens (unless they take the normal path to legally immigrate, of course).</p>
<p>My fear is that Dems are going to come up with a &#8220;regularization process&#8221; with &#8220;earned legalization&#8221; that is nothing but amnesty with another name. I hope that the GOP and the anti-immigration groups are savvy to this and prepared to stop it all costs.</p>

		<p>Immigration amnesty is unlikely because this is an Election Year for our &#8220;honorable&#8221; senators and congressmen. Which translates to Congressional fatcat VOTING FOR AMNESTY would be committing political suicide. Instead, these shysters will try to back-door it in 2011 in hopes of the American voters &#8220;forgetting&#8221; this crime by the time of the 2012 Elections.</p>
<p>Not gonna happen, of course. We WILL keep the list naming the traitors ever in the public eye. That kind of treachery by our worthy politicians would not go unpunished. Even though the Dems are in control, Democrats would also take a massive &#8220;black eye&#8221; by any form of amnesty and would be hurting badly in the elections for a generation. </p>
<p>Come to think of it&hellip; why would MEXICO care? They make every effort to brainwash illegal immigrants into staying &#8220;Mexican.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what, if Mexico wants amnesty for their brethern we need to tell them ok, but only if Americans get the same. It means any gringo or Black person can cross the border and live in Mexico without going through immigration. It means any American can get free medical treatment at their hospitals, American children get free schooling with Spanish-as-a-second language classes paid for by the Mexican taxpayer. It means the Mexicans put up with any American who commits crimes and pays for it. Also, they pay for food stamps etc, housing and provide us with jobs. Agreed Mexico????</p>

		<p>Even if the R party makes a come back this year and in 2012 don&rsquo;t hold your breath waiting for them to reverse this alien invasion. I fear our worst nightmares will come to pass eventually via the traitorous colaberation of D&rsquo;s and R&rsquo;s. We need a viable 3rd party that truly represents US but I don&rsquo;t know how that can come about. Any ideas?</p>
