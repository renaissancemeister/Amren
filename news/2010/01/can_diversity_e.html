<h1><a href="/ar/2007/08/index.html#article1">Can &#8216;Diversity&rsquo; Ever Be Good?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, August 2007</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><cite>American Renaissance</cite> has always opposed racial diversity on the grounds that it threatens the long-term survival of whites and the civilization they created. AR opposes diversity so consistently that it would be easy to assume that it must be an unalloyed evil. But perhaps it is not. It is possible to imagine diversity that was good for a group, if the arrival of aliens improved its chances for survival. This would be the case if the newcomers were much more advanced than the natives, and bettered their living conditions and reproduction rates.</p>
<p>When the Europeans came, North American Indians were living in the Stone Age. The conquest of the continent by whites swept away their way of life, but it would be possible to argue that their descendants living today are better off because of it. Left to themselves, they would not have developed anything like the white man&rsquo;s medicine or technology.</p>
<p>But how many people would be convinced by this argument? Would it be more convincing if we were to imagine a benign European presence that left most of Indian society intact and shared only useful technology? Perhaps not even then.</p>
<p>Over the centuries, Europeans and European-influenced people have made contact with scores of South American jungle tribes that were barely into the tool-making stage, and the results were usually bad. The newcomers sometimes massacred or enslaved the primitives, or killed them unintentionally with diseases to which they had no immunity. It is hard to know whether today&rsquo;s full-blooded Indians of Bolivia or Peru would prefer that the white man had never come  &mdash;  it is virtually impossible to imagine how they would be living now if the Americas had remained undiscovered  &mdash;  but there are plenty of leftists who would argue that they <em>should</em> prefer the dignity of cultural integrity to subordination to Europeans and a few crumbs of Western technology.</p>
<p>Still, humans are glad to get running water, electricity, and Western medicine, and even if they don&rsquo;t have it themselves, like to think their children might have it some day. No primitive people has ever collectively turned its back on improvement and proudly shut itself up in the Stone Age. (The Japanese strictly limited contact with the outside world from about 1640 to 1854, but theirs was a sophisticated society that absorbed useful Western technology and learning even during this period of seclusion.)</p>
<p>The government of Brazil, however, has established an indigenous peoples policy on the assumption that contact and the resulting diversity are <em>never</em> good. Brazil is one of the few countries where there are still tribes deep in the jungle who live in a purely or mostly &#8220;pre-contact&#8221; state. Official policy now is to leave those peoples alone, and to prohibit loggers and developers from interfering with them. Why?</p>
<p>During the 20th century, even under what were thought to be the most sensitive and solicitous conditions, &#8220;contact&#8221; turned out badly. Once they saw tools and foods and trinkets from the outside, tribesmen were unsatisfied with their own. When they came out of the forest, they had no way to make a living, and if they got handouts, they quickly forgot how to live in the forest or simply refused to go back. Many became drunks. The Brazilians finally decided that the damage done by &#8220;contact&#8221; was so great that forest people should be left alone. Even if it meant death in childbirth, rampant disease, unpunished murder, and perpetual ignorance, this was better than the devastation of suddenly being drawn into a new and bewildering world.</p>
<p>Though this may, in the end, be the most humane policy, one hardly knows whether to call it &#8220;liberal&#8221; or &#8220;conservative.&#8221; But it does raise questions about the purpose and advisability of &#8220;diversity.&#8221; Contact offers to primitives an entire universe of possibilities and powers that are entirely beyond their reach. Potential for improvement is so great that this would appear to be the most obvious and perfect example of the benefits of &#8220;diversity.&#8221; And yet even when these powers and possibilities are introduced with the best of intentions, the Brazilians have decided it is best to withhold them because things are likely to go wrong. Even &#8220;diversity&#8221; of a kind that should theoretically bring incalculable benefits is too damaging.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that no one in Brazil complains that the &#8220;no contact&#8221; policy deprives the rest of the country of the wonderful gifts the forest people could bring. Brazilians understand that <em>they</em> are not giving up something in not trying to get the primitives out of the forest. Nor does one hear of even the most Third-World-besotted white leftists emigrating to the jungle to live the rest of their lives in natural, untainted authenticity. No. Everyone implicitly assumes that the primitives have nothing to offer us. We have a great deal to offer them, but they cannot absorb it, so we and they are all better off if they just stay where they are.</p>
<p>Why is it so difficult to see why this argument does not apply to the diversity of the kind white people all around the world are supposed to be celebrating? Brazilians have finally decided that no one benefits when newcomers try to bring the Nuclear Age or even the Age of Steam to people who are still living in the Stone Age. They realize that the reverse process  &mdash;  ambassadors from the Stone Age bringing their &#8220;civilization&#8221; to the 21st century  &mdash;  would be ridiculous. And yet, this is what Americans are officially supposed to promote. Think of the &#8220;diversity&#8221; that could be brought to an American university by someone who has never worn clothes or counted past three. Why even expect such a paragon to go to classes? Let him just walk around campus radiating diversity.</p>
<p>This is only a slight caricature of what we are required to believe. People from failed, hopelessly sclerotic societies who have nothing to offer us (except, perhaps, for a willingness to do manual labor at below-market wages) are a wonderful addition to our society, even though decades of failure have taught Brazilians that people who bring penicillin and pocket knives to people who never heard of them end up leaving their &#8220;beneficiaries&#8221; worse off than they were before.</p>
<p>Can we not get the same respect and consideration as Amazon savages?<br>

		<p>I remember a time, when a white person would talk about how many non-whites friends he had, comedians would make fun of this as a sign of racism. </p>
<p>But diversity need not be bad, it could actually be just great.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, blacks browns and yellows would all fumble over themselves bragging about how many white friends they have.</p>
<p>There would be neighborhoods where only whites could really go. But whites would be welcome in every neighborhood, and if a neighborhood didn&rsquo;t have a certain number of whites, that would be a sure sign of evil &#8216;racism&rsquo;. Diversity could be about what&rsquo;s best for whites. And about sanctions to make sure this is so. </p>
<p>In a perfect world, us true believer AmRen posters would all have an important role to play. We&rsquo;d be heads of university departments, or commissions on race and politics, all with the ear of government industry and the media. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;d all get together and make up a nasty word to use on our opponents. We&rsquo;d say, anyone who doesn&rsquo;t believe the way we do is a &#8216;hatemonger&rsquo;. We&rsquo;d make &#8216;hatemongering&rsquo; the worst crime in America. Then we&rsquo;d say, only whites couldn&rsquo;t be hatemongers. Hardened criminals would be drug off to jail, pleading, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not a hatemonger please believe me&#8221;.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be links to Aryan Nations, right on the main page of &#8216;White is Right.com&rsquo; the nations number 1 web site. </p>
<p>Every once in awhile, someone might ponder, whether or not whites could be hatemongers too, just to make it all seem fair.<br>
And when some poor hispanic lady sobs, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not a hatemonger, I have lots of white friends&#8221;. We would all pronounce, ah ha This is the proof. Whites are all victims of hatemongers.</p>
<p>In a perfect world. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;(The Japanese strictly limited contact with the outside world from about 1640 to 1854, but theirs was a sophisticated society that absorbed useful Western technology and learning even during this period of seclusion.)&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a highly interesting point by Mr. Taylor.</p>
<p>The Japanese were unified under the Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu after the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. After that battle, Westerners were more and more isolated in that country, until eventually the trading port of Nagasaki was where they were limited to living and trading in. Shogun Ieyasu, was particularly keen on expelling the Spanish and Portuguese who did not only come to trade in Japan, but were also seeking converts to Catholicism. The arrival of the British and the Dutch in 1600, was seen as an opportunity by him to use these two latter enemies of the former two useful, but equally troublesome &ldquo;barbarians,&rdquo; as their replacements. </p>
<p>The British and the Dutch, who were only interested in trade, really seemed to fit the bill for him.</p>
<p>While whites often have very little to learn from nonwhites, the Japanese approach to &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; is certainly a must. Be it from the Tokugawa Shogunate&rsquo;s approach or the modern Japanese one; it always changes, while also remaining the same!</p>

		<p>I agree with the article however American Indians are not better off today, and they didn&rsquo;t need medicine until Europeans brought disease over.  What kind of medicine did the Europeans bring with them?  Bloodletting and other kinds of ridiculous practices.  Medical techniques did not actually improve to where they could be considered beneficial until very recently.  Also without the agricultural techniques and the knowledge of the land the natives had, the Europeans more than likely would not have survived.  </p>
<p>Not to mention the destruction of the land itself.</p>
<p>So when you look at it, especially with what is happening today and the reason this website exists is that maybe the white man isn&rsquo;t as smart as he thinks he is.  The majority(who originally were voting, white, landowning males) did lead us down this path.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just sayin.</p>

		<p>This is a particularly insightful piece by Mr. Taylor, which oddly perhaps, reflects the thinking of the &#8220;great emancipator&#8221; Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>While Lincoln abhorred the institution of slavery, he had no illusions regarding the successful integration of former black African slaves into the population of the US at large.</p>
<p>It was Lincoln&rsquo;s intention to remove former slaves, to the extent that it was possible, from the US and return them to Africa or re-settle them in the Caribbean or Central America.</p>
<p>When delegations were sent to Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras to explore the latter possibility, these investigations provoked such alarm within these nascent countries that they threatened to resist such measures with armed force.</p>
<p>In any event, Lincoln was assassinated before these plans could be implemented or even be further explored.</p>
<p>How successful Lincoln might have been in these efforts had he lived is idle speculation at the point, and pretty much forbidden speculation at that, at least within polite company.</p>
<p>But it leaves little doubt that had he lived, Lincoln would have been, at the least, a confirmed segregationist.<br>

		<p>Mr. Taylor raises a salient point; Brazil has decided that multiculturalism/diversity/integration has done more harm than good to the primitive Amazonian tribes.</p>
<p>Whites should adopt the same policy w/other Third World types: let&rsquo;s stay separate from them. After all, they should be able to develop on their own without white technology since the races are all equal and race is merely a social construct. </p>

		<p>One of the more comical aspects of the diversity propagandists is that they will passionately argue that America has always been an amazingly diverse land, which is definitely true on the West Coast, since the Gold Rush drew in everyone and their aunt Hatty. On the other hand, 15 minutes later the same people will argue that our current mass immigration binge has brought wonderful scintillating diversity to our formerly boring uptight unjust oppressive racist &#8220;white-bread&#8221; Ozzie-and-Harriet America. So which is it?<br>

		<p>Well, this whole topic of contacting tribes in the Brazilian jungle that have &#8220;never experienced&#8221; the white man is most interesting. It should be noted that these tribes to some extent for a long time have had INDIRECT contact with the whites in various fashions. Illegal loggers, rubber tappers, collectors of brazil nuts accidentally run into these undiscovered tribes all the time.</p>
<p>The tools and implements of the white man are also traded among the various tribes in the jungle, one tribe that is already in contact bartering and obtaining &#8220;stuff&#8221; that is traded with other tribesmen that are undiscovered.</p>
<p>Most of these tribesmen too are very violent and liable to kill even those that have good intentions toward them. The tribes have been living in a state of low-intensity conflict for thousands of years and see no reason to stop now.</p>
<p>With regard to the Japanese and the arrivfal  of the British, Dutch, Spanish, Port, etc.:</p>
<p>The various western powers that arrived in Japan also brought firearms. Weapons that replaced the sword and were highly prized by the Japanese. So much so was the threat posed to the samurai order by the arrival of the white mans weapon that all guns were confiscated and destroyed as an attempt, successful, to maintain the ruling elite.</p>

		<p>Diversity is actually not the most critical thing that Whites should be concerned about. As Mr. Taylor has pointed out before, there are plenty of racially homogeneous places around the world that are neither prosperous nor stable at all. Just because a group of people are &#8216;alike&rsquo; does not guarantee that their collective efforts will bring about success&hellip;</p>
<p>What Whites should really be concerned with is the declining average White racial quality. Even if Whites today were somehow able to &#8216;re-homogenize&rsquo; their societies, by divine intervention or some other extraordinary means, they would still face enormous difficulties, because the average racial quality has fallen significantly since the middle-18th century. Whites today are less intelligent, less physically fit, less independent-minded, less spiritually healthy, less disciplined, less mentally-stable, etc. It is not too surprising why Whites in the 18th and early 19th century achieved such incredible success   &mdash;   we had a much higher average racial quality. It is a whole different ballgame today. </p>
<p>Races aren&rsquo;t stable; they change as different people reproduce more than others. At most, diversity can reduce &#8216;transaction costs&rsquo; within a society, and also allow for more open discussion on issues that would otherwise be &#8216;taboo&rsquo; in a heterogenous society. But that is it. Diversity doesn&rsquo;t do anything else. A homogeneous White society would still face the incredible competition coming from the East, and given the nature of Whites today   &mdash;   a nature that would still remain even AFTER the fantasy of removing diversity from White societies   &mdash;   it is doubtful that they would come out on top&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being pessimistic, I&rsquo;m just being honest. Look around you with honest eyes and you will see that most Whites are not the same as those who existed here 200 years ago&hellip;</p>

		<p>In a perfect world sexism would be an overriding national obsession.  There would be dialogues about it all the time.  Gloria Allred would be hated but feared because she would bring down anyone who called a woman a sexist slur to his knees.  He would lose his reputation and his job. Being sexist would be so thoroughly stigmatized that people wouldn&rsquo;t want to think of themselves as being sexist.</p>
<p>There would be a women&rsquo;s community and solidarity around all things great and small.  If one woman was called the c-word or the b-word or the h-word by a man, all the other women would feel offended and men would feel concerned.  No one would think the woman deserved it.</p>
<p>There would be a female president and no one would think that she shouldn&rsquo;t be a president simply because she&rsquo;s a woman.  Anyone who said that would be instantly fired.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s my rant.  But to stick to the topic.</p>
<p>If you say that diversity is weakness, you&rsquo;re basically saying you want black people to go back to Africa.  What do you want black people like me to do?  I don&rsquo;t want anything to do with black people or primitive cultures and their sexism along with their other many foibles.</p>
