<h1>Justice Sues Swim Club</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Annie Tasker, The Intelligencer  (Philadelphia), January 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Lower Moreland club, which is seeking bankruptcy, was accused of ousting a group of day campers because of their race.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice filed suit Wednesday against a Lower Moreland swim club accused of ousting black and Hispanic day campers this summer because of their race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks to bar the club from doing anything similar in the future, said Department of Justice spokesman Alejandro Miyar. The filing asks that the club&rsquo;s discriminatory policies and practices be declared a violation of Title II of the Civil Rights Act and that the club and its associates be kept from denying those rights in the future.</p>
<p>But the pool complex, now in the midst of Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings, doesn&rsquo;t appear to have much future left.</p>
<p>The Valley Club has closed its doors for good, said the club&rsquo;s bankruptcy attorney, Michael Cibik.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no intentions of opening,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Valley Club is closed from now until eternity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Valley Club still exists as a legal entity but is likely to dissolve once the bankruptcy proceedings wrap up, he said.</p>
<p>Miyar said the Department of Justice is suing the club as an entity. He declined to comment on how the proceedings might play out.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brian Mildenberg, an attorney representing Creative Steps families suing the club, said the bankruptcy proceedings have put a temporary hold on his clients&rsquo; suit  &mdash;  though they may ask the courts for permission to move forward.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Word came in late September that the Department of Justice was investigating the swim club, a probe requested by Sen. Arlen Specter, D-Pa. The news came just days after the release of a report from the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission that disclosed damning and previously unknown details about how largely white club members reacted to the group of black and Hispanic day campers.</p>
<p>The report concluded that race was a motivating factor in the Valley Club&rsquo;s decision to ask the campers not to return.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pool officials have maintained that the issue was never skin color, but safety. This summer was the first time day camps were admitted to the private swim club. The idea looked fine on paper, officials have said, but in reality created a safety issue because there weren&rsquo;t enough lifeguards on duty to properly supervise dozens of extra children.</p>

		<p>All this means is that since government fines, taxes and penalties get first bidding in bankruptcy procedures, that the club&rsquo;s other creditors probably aren&rsquo;t going to get much if anything.</p>

		<p>I see that commenter &#8220;rabfur13&#8221; at the Intelligencer website wants the Feds to pursue the individual club members, including a couple of teachers who made politically incorrect remarks about the dear little daycampers.  In other words, because members of a private club discriminated against minority children, their bank accounts should be emptied &amp; their lives ruined.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rabfur&rsquo;s&#8221; merciless righteousness reminds me of how several members of a discussion group I belong to reacted, when - during a discussion of political correctness - I described the public destruction of scientist James Watson (the co-discoverer of DNA) after he suggested that Africa&rsquo;s under-development might have something to do with the low IQ of much of its population.  EVERYone who responded to my description condemned Watson, and said he got what he deserved.  One person even challenged the idea that Africa WAS under-developed.  All of the four respondents were women, btw.  And all of them had proclaimed, earlier in the discussion, how much they abhorred political correctness.    </p>

<p>Take note right now.  Much anti-white harassment and action are going on behind the scene in this administration, especially the Justice Department.  If there were a bigger anti-white hater in the Obamanation&rsquo;s administration than himself, it would have to be Eric Holder, although there are many to choose from.</p>
<p>And it isn&rsquo;t just harassment suits by the corrupt EEOC for discrimination.</p>
<p>Does anyone know that the Obamanation&rsquo;s promise to let the second amendment alone was just another of his black lies and he is ordering the Justice Department to go after gun owners via the BATF?  It&rsquo;s true.  The BATF is sending out ORDERS&hellip;yes, that&rsquo;s the correct word&hellip;.ORDERS&hellip;for all gun shows to stop selling arms to private citizens and they are also pressing to stop the sale of weapons between private citizens, even though there is no law that such sales are illegal.  Texas and Illinois have letters from the BATF right now, placing onerous burdens on them so they will comply.</p>
<p>Much is quietly being done by these black miscreants and their mentally disturbed white cohorts, besides protecting Black Panther co-horts from legal action.</p>
<p>I seriously doubt that the Obamanation cares if he is re-elected or not as long as he can get the majority of his agenda in force in four years.  With this evil black hate-monger it is ideology first, last and always.</p>
<p>Rush Limbaugh believes Obama wants to destroy the country in order to remake it from the ground up.  &#8220;We are only five days away from fundementally transforming this nation,&#8221; he said at a rally five days prior to the election.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundementally transforming this nation,&#8221; has been mentioned by him many times as his chief goal&hellip;.on tape.  And he doesn&rsquo;t mean making this democracy better, but transforming it into one where blacks will have the same as everybody else the same way Cuba does.  He KNOWS blacks can&rsquo;t compete in a first world society, so he must remake it into one where the system is more in line with Cuba where they are &#8220;awarded&#8221; what they want and feel they need.</p>
<p>This mentally challenged black is going to bring the roof down on his own head, because there&rsquo;s a huge groundswell of opposition growing against him, and it will get more vocal and more physical with each passing month.  His natural black arrogance will not allow him to see this.</p>
<p>This country has never known such injustice and evil to the degree it is now.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many people belonged to the swim club, but I&rsquo;m guessing that all of them are racially aware of the situation in the U.S. relative to blacks and Whites now, so at least some good came of it&hellip;.A personal interview of some, or all of the members might be&hellip;.enlightening!</p>

		<p>Attorney Brian Mildenberg sounds like a white guy to me. I&rsquo;d bet on it.</p>
<p>A white guy who obviously won&rsquo;t hesitate for a moment to bury fellow whites any time he gets a chance. He and his colleagues probably practice competitive altruism with one another in their misdirected efforts to champion minority causes, no matter how frivolous. </p>
<p>All Mildenberg wants is the money and recognition. He also knew he couldn&rsquo;t lose given the political and social climate in regards to racial minorities. My my, how convenient.</p>
<p>And to add insult to injury to his white victims, litigation attorneys like Mildenberg, are largely subsidized with the money of producers in our society to give (some of it) to those who don&rsquo;t. Fortunately, because the club was incorporated, he couldn&rsquo;t sue anyone individually. </p>
<p> All this so he can probably practice his &#8220;own&#8221; form of implicit whiteness. Like living in an all- white community, joining an all- white country club where he can shmooze with fellow brown-stoner types and attend all white functions and social events. What audacity!</p>
<p>This kind of outright blend of arrogance/hypocrisy and &#8220;diversity for thee, but not for me&#8221; and &#8220;got mine Jack&#8221; attitude makes me want to puke,- ON HIM!</p>

		<p>Although I abhor white adult club members using disparaging remarks on minority school children (if this, in fact, truly happened), it is their constitutional RIGHT as U.S. citizens to express their honest feelings. It&rsquo;s called freedom of speech. As I understand it, no Creative Steps supervisor was immediately on hand when this army of children suddenly descended upon the Valley Club swimming pool, so there is at least some shared culpability here. The lasting effect of all this, I promise, is that no private suburban swim club in its collective right mind will EVER invite minority day campers to use its facilities again. The Valley Club got precisely what it deserved for its attempt at &#8220;bridging the racial gap.&#8221; I hope the bozo who extended the initial invitation loses his shirt for this. As for Arlen Specter, who sought to use this event to score brownie points with Pennsylvania voters, I hope you PA folks will show him the same warm welcome come election time that Massachusetts has just showed its Democratic senatorial candidate. It&rsquo;s up to you, PA, to toss this pc blockhead out on his ear&hellip;..Oh, by the way, I love your website and I am Hispanic.</p>

<p>Well, even so, you don&rsquo;t invite people in and then tell them to get out! (Especially when they&rsquo;re all black and you&rsquo;re all white!)  Management should have known better. There has to be more to it than is being told here.  The whole thing was handled very, very badly. </p>
<p>(I have to wonder if it could even have been set up by that very pro-integration manager who created this whole mess &hellip; perhaps on purpose?   It&rsquo;s hard to believe that anyone could have been that innocently stupid.)</p>
<p>Anyway, wasn&rsquo;t this all predicted right here on Amren when the story came out?  It&rsquo;s going just as predicted. So one more white swim club bites the dust. Chalk up another victory to integration.</p>

<p>There was a very interesting story on Holder, by Steve Sailer. It gives some useful insights into the background of Holder, insights which explain his mental orientation on these matters.  It must be understood that Holder is not an American black.  He&rsquo;s a Barbadian, from a West Indian family proud of its Barbadian heritage   &mdash;  -  a member of the mulatto aristocracy.   In Barbados, they wouldn&rsquo;t even be referred to as &#8220;black&#8221; at all. He must chafe a lot from being considered black in the States. He&rsquo;s probably resentful, angry, insulted, and looking for revenge on the society that has consigned him to blackness. In Barbados it would not have been so. I highly recommend the article.</p>
<p> <i>&#8220;Although 90 percent of Barbados&rsquo; population is said to be &ldquo;Afro-Bajan&rdquo;, Barbados has a fairly large mixed-race middle class who typically call themselves &ldquo;white&rdquo; (for example, the Barbadian pop singer Rihanna, who is considered black in America) &hellip; Ironically, more than few of these West Indians who call themselves white in the Islands have gone into the civil rights business as &#8220;black&#8221; leaders in the U.S. For example, President Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;African-American&rdquo; Attorney General Eric Holder &hellip;&#8221; </i><br/>

<p>   Can&rsquo;t people have a private club and admit only members they want? Maybe, I want a club of only red-haired Zoroastrians, who are also MENSA members. I guess I could expect a federal lawsuit (under the bogus &ldquo;Commerce Clause&rdquo;) and a debilitating financial settlement. </p>

		<p>You wait and see, the goverment is going to end up taking control of the facilities with goverment power and dollars.Then give it to the blacks. It might be a public pool but after a lot of blacks go there just how many whites will go there. None, because the white girls will be sexually harassed and the goverment will do nothing to protect them.If no white girls show up the white boys will not have incentive to show up.<br/>
We see it all the time&hellip;.whites make a nice place to live or enjoy and the blacks demand the right to attend. They ruin it for whites and the blacks destroy it &hellip;then want admission to the new white organization that was built&hellip;deja vu all over again. </p>

		<p>I have followed these events via AMREN from the beginning as I immediately smelled a very big black rat. It is obvious that, once again, anything successful, White, and well run will be coveted by the non-White &#8216;community&rsquo; and every means possible be used to gain control. Using the flimsiest of &#8216;racist&rsquo; excuses to bring this club to bankruptcy will then be followed by city hall buying the property for a nominal dollar and then re-opening it for the exclusive use of disadvantaged non-White children. Ah, but these little innocents will require well-trained, responsible supervision so in will pour an unlimited number of &#8216;adults&rsquo; and break the very same health and safety rules that led to the problem in the first place. To leave a fully functioning facility to be seized in this fashion will be a travesty. If vandals had broke into the premises a year ago, emptied the pool, poured Portland cement into the outlet drains, totally destroyed the circulation pumping and chlorination system then wrecked any lighting, the club members at the time would have been denied any further use of the facilities but no one else would have blinked an eyelid.</p>

		<p>I dont think this lawsuit will get anywhere since it seems to bar someone from doing something in the future. I would not put money on that though since all of the crazy liberal judges out there would love to punish someone for alleged &#8220;racism&#8221; where none really exists. </p>

<p>ranger:  I wasn&rsquo;t aware of his background.  Your explanation sheds a bit more light on him, and I have no doubt you&rsquo;re right.

<p>ranger:  For certain those you mentioned are the real force behind this troubled man.   However, in spite of that, he&rsquo;s going forward because he passionately believes in what they want him to do, so he, therefore is a target for criticism.  That they could get someone else to replace him doesn&rsquo;t exonerate him from guilt for his devious designs, nor does it lessen his importance, because without any of them he would constitue just as great a danger now that he is in office.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a matter of deciding who is more culpable.  Criticizing Obama is the same as criticizing them all. </p>
<p>The entire administration is filled with malcontents, Marxist revolutionaries and white haters, both black and white.  It&rsquo;s a conglomeration of the country&rsquo;s flakes, oddballs and misfits all under one roof.<br/>

The flotsam and the jetsam.<br/>
Obama and Holder are two rage-filled mulattos out to get even with the world that calls them black.  As has been discussed here elsewhere, the angry, disaffected mulatto is the worst of the worst. Just take the Rev. Wright, Malcolm X,  Julian Bond, Elijah Muhammed, for examples&hellip;among many. Getting even with white society becomes their life&rsquo;s mission. Their obsession. The lighter they are, the more resentful they are.  How dare you be white, and they&rsquo;re not!</p>
