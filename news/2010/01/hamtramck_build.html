<h1><a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MICHIGAN_HOUSING_DISCRIMINATION?SITE=FLTAM&amp;SECTION=US">Hamtramck Builds Homes to Atone for Discrimination</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ed White, AP, January 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 40 years after her family was forced from their home because they were black, Sallie Sanders received the keys to a new house built to settle one of the longest-running cases of housing discrimination in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;My parents would be ecstatic that their offspring would be able to enjoy the things they couldn&rsquo;t,&#8221; the 60-year-old Sanders said Monday before a ceremony to celebrate the milestone on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.</p>
<p>Hamtramck agreed in 1980 to develop 200 family housing units to make up for violating the civil rights of blacks whose neighborhoods were targeted by white officials to make way for urban renewal projects in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Hamtramck still hasn&rsquo;t met that goal, although officials predict it will by next year. The city of 23,000 is now extremely diverse, with immigrants from the Middle East, Africa and Bangladesh passing by a statue of Pope John Paul II in the historically Polish community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 2000 census found 41 percent of residents were born in another country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t always true. In 1971, after a three-week trial, a federal judge said Hamtramck had a clear strategy when it demolished housing in poor neighborhoods. Blacks were 14.5 percent of Hamtramck&rsquo;s population in 1960, but only 8.5 percent six years later, noted Damon Keith, now a judge on the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>It took until 1980 for all sides to agree to a solution: Two hundred family housing units, as well as 150 units for senior citizens, would be offered at below-market rates to black plaintiffs in the lawsuit. It didn&rsquo;t take long to build the senior housing, but construction on the rest didn&rsquo;t start until 2004.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s current lawyer, James Allen Sr., agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;This litigation was used as a political wedge issue. The us-versus-them mentality kept people in political office,&#8221; he [James Allen Sr., the city&rsquo;s current lawyer] said.</p>
<p>That changed when Gary Zych became mayor in the late 1990s. He said resolving the discrimination case was a moral issue as well as a practical one. Hamtramck couldn&rsquo;t develop vacant land for other purposes until it built the subsidized housing.</p>
<p>Half of the 200 units have been completed, and the rest could be finished by 2011. The homes are a mix of new construction and renovated units to be sold or rented, Barnhart said. The federal government, state of Michigan and Wayne County are helping Hamtramck with money or properties.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since many of the 500 plaintiffs in the lawsuit have died or moved away from the Detroit area, the housing has been offered to their children or grandchildren. If they aren&rsquo;t interested, units will be offered to others.</p>

		<p>Urban Removal in the Fillmore district in San Francisco in the 1960s is what rescued the city from becoming a high crime semi ghetto.  I am extremely grateful that it did happen.  Justin Herman, its architect, is San Francisco&rsquo;s greatest hero.  </p>

		<p>#1, good point.  Do blacks stop and think, &#8220;Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;places where we don&rsquo;t live and only whites do, it&rsquo;s clean and safe and very liveable.  Places were WE live and are in control, it&rsquo;s dirty, a ghetto, full of crime and all other bad things&#8221;?  They never seem to wonder why most whites don&rsquo;t wnt to be around them.</p>

		<p>There is some awareness on the part of blacks that neighborhoods that are desirable (lower crime, quieter, clean and orderly) are predominantly White. Areas that are mostly non-White are less safe, etc. For this reason, blacks want to move from the less liveable neighborhoods to nicer neighborhoods. The problem is that more diverse the neighborhood, the less anyone wants to live there. </p>

		<p>The liberals/socialists in control of Florida&rsquo;s Capital City, Tallahassee, have tried for years to &#8220;rehabilitate&#8221; an urban core of black businesses and residential structures.  Periodically, large sums of taxpayer dollars are thrown at the area to destroy crack houses, rundown homes, and to sweep up the garbage and broken whiskey bottles.  And like clockwork, sometimes within just months, the pool halls reopen and the prostitutes are out trolling.  Not once have these people any inclination to help themselves.  Any volunteer help mostly comes from white kids, high school and college, earning required &#8220;volunteer&#8221; hours to graduate.</p>
