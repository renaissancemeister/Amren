<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8438865.stm">US Lifts HIV/Aids Immigration Ban</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, January 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The US has lifted a 22-year immigration ban which has stopped anyone with HIV/Aids from entering the country.</p>
<p>President Obama said the ban was not compatible with US plans to be a leader in the fight against the disease.</p>
<p>The new rules come into force on Monday and the US plans to host a global HIV/Aids summit for the first time in 2012.</p>
<p>The ban was imposed at the height of a global panic about the disease at the end of the 1980s.</p>
<p>It put the US in a group of just 12 countries, also including Libya and Saudi Arabia, that excluded anyone suffering from HIV/Aids.</p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Charles Scanlon, in Miami, says that improving treatments and evolving public perceptions have helped to bring about the change.</p>
<p>Rachel Tiven, head of the campaign group Immigration Equality, told the BBC that the step was long overdue.</p>
<p>&#8220;The 2012 World Aids Conference, due to be held in the United States, was in jeopardy as a result of the restrictions. It&rsquo;s now likely to go ahead as planned,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In October, President Obama said the entry ban had been &#8220;rooted in fear rather than fact&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We lead the world when it comes to helping stem the Aids pandemic  &mdash;  yet we are one of only a dozen countries that still bar people with HIV from entering our own country.&#8221;<br>

		<p>We import terrorists and people with incurable, drug resistant TB.  Why not also import people with AIDS?  It can cost over a million $$ to treat each AIDS patient. But thank God that we will now have free health care.  Now anyone with AIDS from anywhere in the World can come and be cared for for life, by the generosity of American Taxpayers.  </p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t the best way to stem the pandemic not to let people in who have the disease?</p>

		<p>That ban was observed in the breach, if at all.  There were so many special exemptions granted it was meaningless.  Same goes for any other restrictions we used to have in place - hey, send us your tubercular, bedbug-infested, indigent sex workers yearning to breath free.  I wish people would get over this totally false image of the wise DOS bureaucrat soberly considering visa requests.  I worked among them, and they&rsquo;re pinhead liberal elitists who can&rsquo;t reason their way out of a paper bag and are more than happy to issue a visa to whomever asks.  HIV positive?  Muslim bomber wannabe?  Sure, come on in!  Don&rsquo;t people understand?  There is NO ONE guarding the gates.</p>

		<p>Another example of liberal insanity.  This will cost the U.S. more money and will spread more AIDS in the country.  </p>
<p>Plus, they can stay in the country illegally and help destroy the already burdened health care system.</p>

		<p>The liberal gambit is that we are all hopelessly ignorant rednecks who believe that we will catch AIDS from a handshake<br>
or a public toilet seat. Thats what Obama says we &#8220;fear&#8221;.<br>
Let me suggest what we fear is the $500,000 hospital bill passed off on the public when Kenyan AIDS patient ends up in a American hospital..where by law medical treatment cannot be denied. This is the real world that no liberal will go near. Instead reality is going to come to them in the form of total defeat at the polls. <br>

		<p>My state is bankrupt, and the entire nation is on the verge of bankruptcy - and this jerque who calls himself a president opens the doors to immigrants who have the disease called AIDS?  We obviously are not having a lot of success paying the bills we already have; we don&rsquo;t need immigrants coming here to grab free healthcare and use up more of the resources that belong to legal Americans.  But what else can we expect from a man who places loyalty to race (Africans have by far the greatest number of AIDS patients) above loyalty to our nation and its best interests?</p>

		<p>The first responsibility of a national government is to protect its citizens. That was the reason for banning HIV/AIDs carriers. But that idea is old hat.  Now, our President is running our country in the interests of the whole world, not in our best interests. He doesn&rsquo;t care what we think of him; he sees himself as a global leader and he&rsquo;s out to impress foreigners with what a generous fellow he is.   What am I paying taxes for? </p>

<p>If I recall, it seems that between Bush leaving and Obamaster taking over, the two of them signed off on $130 BILLION dollars to give to AFRICAN despots for &#8220;AIDS research&#8221; I guess because we in the U.S. have no competent researchers.</p>

<p>So in other words, no good deed goes unpunished.</p>
<p>So how about if we stop sending our taxpayer&rsquo;s money to other countries to help them deal with their AIDS problem? Does that mean we will then no longer be obligated to allow AIDS carriers into ours?</p>

IF you ever find yourself confronted by an African rapist, keep in mind if you don&rsquo;t fight to the death you will probably will probably contract this wonderful disease and wish you were dead. </p>

<p>He said: &#8220;We lead the world when it comes to helping stem the Aids pandemic - &#8220;</p>
<p>Does he not even realize that what he said was contradictory?  We lead the world, but we plan to lead the world, which presumably means we don&rsquo;t now, but he then says that we do.  Truly, words mean nothing to him, they are merely tools of power.</p>

		<p>I a quick and inconclusive search of the diseases that allow for denial of a visa, of the nine I found only HIV is incurable.    <br>
The study I would like to see is of those that know they have HIV, what is the likelihood of them infecting another in the course of their lifetimes?  Further what are the lifetime costs of medical support for those HIV immigrants?<br>
I can&rsquo;t imagine a worse policy that to let people with known incurable infectious diseases into this country.</p>

<p>One contracts HIV and then MAYBE it develops into AIDS.  If you don&rsquo;t have risky sex, you shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of anything.  The best course, if you are young and a race realist is to find a white female race realist, get married and have two or three white babies and raise them with pride in themselves and their heritage.  Further, I would advise you to not lie to them about anything; teach white religion not middle eastern myths.</p>

		<p>Do people really think that immigrants with HIV are going to come here and keep their hands to themselves???? Of course they&rsquo;re not. It also costs about a million to treat one with HIV over the course of a lifetime. This policy will do nothing but increase HIV in the US as well as further burden the beleagered American taxpayer. Political correctness once again comes before the welfare of the citizens.</p>
