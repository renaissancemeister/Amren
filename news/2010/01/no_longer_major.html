<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Since 2000, the proportion of whites living there [in central Harlem] has more than doubled, to more than one in 10 residents  &mdash;  the highest since the 1940s. The Hispanic population, which was concentrated in East Harlem, is now at an all-time high in central Harlem, up 27 percent since 2000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The 1990 census counted only 672 whites in central Harlem. By 2000, there were 2,200. The latest count, in 2008, recorded nearly 13,800.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 15 percent of Harlem&rsquo;s black population is foreign-born, mostly from the Caribbean, with a growing number from Africa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other analysts point to the outflow of some blacks and the influx of others as positive evidence that barriers to integration have fallen in other neighborhoods and that Harlem has become a more attractive place to live.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Geneva Bain, the district manager of Community Board 10, {snip} acknowledged, though, that white newcomers have sometimes been greeted ambivalently. &#8220;Integration is very subjective,&#8221; Ms. Bain said. &#8220;One person&rsquo;s fellowship is another person&rsquo;s antagonism. I am one who thinks that central Harlem has become a better place because of integration.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What happened to the Harlem of the West(The Fill-moe) in San Francisco is happening to the original Harlem.But,beware, Whitey. Don&rsquo;t go there yet(remember the white woman who was raped for 20 hours and then burned in the face with acid about a year ago)? </p>

		<p> Why is Whites moving in and blacks moving out called &#8220;displacement,&#8221; while Whites moving out of neighborhoods that are becoming increasingly black is called &#8220;White flight&#8221;? In other words, it&rsquo;s always the White folks&rsquo; fault, right?</p>
<p> Anyway, I hope the movement of increasing numbers of we of the Caucasian persuasion into Harlem helps blacks to see how WE feel when one of &#8220;our&#8221; neighborhoods is taken over by them.</p>

		<p>White newcomers are sometimes treated &#8220;ambivalently&#8221; huh? So let me get this straight. When blacks move into a majorty white neighborhood and are less than welcome, we whites are called racists bigots that should be ashamed of ourselves, but when the situation is reversed, the blacks are just &#8220;ambivalent&#8221;? OH THAT&rsquo;S RIGHT! My mistake. I forgot that ONLY whites can be racists. Silly me&hellip;.  </p>

		<p>One hundred years ago Harlem was almost exclusively white with a lot of prestige accorded to owning a residence in that part of NYC?</p>
<p>Then became almost all black and now becoming more &#8220;diverse&#8221;?</p>
<p>NOT so long ago it would have been mortally physcially dangerous for a white to show their face in Harlem?</p>
<p>I recall reading this article a long time ago about these two brothers that lived in a four story walk-up in Harlem. One brother was invalided, the other was found dead caught in a home-made booby trap of his own devising. The booby trap was one of many the home owner had put in place to dissuade intruders. You had to read between the lines to realize these two were the last whites living in the area and had been for some time. Were obvious targets for vandalism and home invasion.<br/>

		<p>When Harlem was a 99.9% Bantu enclave, there were no community improvement programs going on. The neighborhood remained mired in crime, blight, declining property values and hopelessness.</p>
<p>Now that a few thousand whites have moved into the Harlem neighborhood (for which they should be awarded a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award), Bantus, who did absolutely nothing positive for the neighborhood in all the time they lived there, are suddenly foaming at the mouth, about being displaced. They simply cannot stand to see white people actually making improvements in a neighborhood for which they did nothing, but run it down.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, that&rsquo;s what happened in the old South Africa. A group of Dutch settlers trekked into previously uninhabited southern Africa, and built up a nation that became the most powerful (economically) in Africa. Shaka Zulu, Xavier Xhosa and Bushman Bob licked their chops and decided to crash the party. Soon, they became the majority population, but the country was still maintained by Whitey. The Bantus were embarrassed by it, and started their anti-apartheid agitations, until they finally gained complete control in 1994. Now, they are running it into the ground.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Timbuktu, the seat of the old &#8220;Mali Empire&#8221;, is slowly being swallowed up by the Sahara Desert. The Bantus are doing absolutely nothing in the way of &#8220;urban renewal&#8221; there.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? </p>

		<p>Rev. Manning (please youtube his sermons, especially the one &#8220;her name is Ms Ann&#8221;) accused blacks of being so lazy and worthless that they &#8220;can&rsquo;t even keep Harlem!&#8221; he is a black preacher of exceptional truthfulness and honesty and is openly critical and derisive of the black thug culture.</p>
