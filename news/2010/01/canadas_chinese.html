<h1>Canada&rsquo;s Chinese Immigrants Assimilate Quickly, Easily</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michel Viatteau, AFP, January 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a cafe in this western Canadian town, a customer orders a soda from his server. Though both customer and waitress are Chinese, the pair converse easily and comfortably in English.</p>
<p>The waitress speaks both Mandarin and Cantonese, so she would have no difficulty understanding the order in either of China&rsquo;s main languages.</p>
<p>So why speak in English? &#8220;That&rsquo;s what we speak here,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The interaction is not an anomaly in this town, where nearly half the 188,000 residents are of Chinese origin, nor in Vancouver, the nearest city, where some 381,500 people  &mdash;  one in five residents  &mdash;  are originally from China.</p>
<p>It is an example of the way the majority of Chinese immigrants to Canada have assimilated quickly and easily into the country&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>Immigration from China has grown rapidly in recent years, with the number of newcomers swelling the Chinese population in Vancouver by 22.8 percent between 1996 and 2001, and 11.3 percent from 2001 to 2006, according to government agency Statistics Canada.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, economic opportunity is not always the primary motive for those who choose to move from China to Canada and those who emigrate may even seek funds from family back home rather than sending remittances.</p>
<p>That was the case for Eileen Lao, 43, who left Guangzhou for Vancouver in February 2007.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our level of living is worse,&#8221; she told AFP. &#8220;We had no financial problems in China,&#8221; Lao added. But to buy a house in Richmond, she and her husband  &mdash;  an engineer who has only been able to find part-time work  &mdash;  had to borrow money from family back home.</p>
<p>So why cross the ocean and move?</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to change my life,&#8221; she said, adding that despite a few lifestyle changes she is &#8220;quite happy&#8221; with her new life in Canada.</p>
<p>Lao had visited Canada four times before emigrating with her husband and their daughter Huang.</p>
<p>The family speaks Cantonese at home, but Huang, 17, attends a school where only English is spoken.</p>
<p>Eileen Lao speaks the language with ease and has a hard time pinpointing any difficulties adapting to life in her new home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mailboxes are green in China, they are red here,&#8221; she said finally. &#8220;Because of the color it took a while before we knew these were mailboxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also acknowledged finding it tough to accept the approach of Canada&rsquo;s media, which she deals with in her capacity as a public relations person for SUCCESS, an NGO that helps new immigrants to Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;Media is different here. In China it is propaganda, promotion of things well done. Here they speak of disasters or human rights, look for negative sides,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Despite the differences, Lao hopes to one day acquire Canadian citizenship, expressing a comfort with her new country that is echoed by many Chinese immigrants.</p>
<p>According to a 2002 study by Statistics Canada, 76 percent of Chinese immigrants felt strongly attached to Canada and 58 percent said they also strongly identified with their own ethnic and cultural group.</p>
<p>For Lao, there&rsquo;s no reason to pick one side or the other, whether the issue is identity, language or even sporting events like the Winter Olympics that Vancouver will host in February.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter who wins, I will give my wholehearted congratulations to him. That is also the beauty of the Olympics, isn&rsquo;t it?&#8221;<br>

		<p>This article does not reflect the true attitudes and behaviours of Chinese immigrants to the Vancouver area. I can&rsquo;t remember when I&rsquo;ve read such nonsense.</p>
<p><em>So why speak in English? &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we speak here,&rdquo; she said.</em></p>
<p>Really? Even the casual observer will note that Chinese speak only Chinese in public or private exclusively unless they&rsquo;re forced to speak English. On the rare occasion when they do speak English it is with a heavy Chinese accent and almost unintelligible to native speakers.</p>
<p><em>&hellip;the majority of Chinese immigrants to Canada have assimilated quickly and easily into the country&rsquo;s population.</em></p>
<p>In fact the Chinese in Vancouver have the numbers, the neighbourhoods, and the economic wherewithall to disregard any kind of assimilation. In fact Canadian immigration policies encourage diversity rather than assimilation (read Daniel Stoffman&rsquo;s book &#8220;Who Gets In&#8221;).</p>
<p><em>According to a 2002 study by Statistics Canada, 76 percent of Chinese immigrants felt strongly attached to Canada&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Yes, I can see this attachment. But it&rsquo;s not an attachment of national and cultural pride rather it&rsquo;s an attachment of investments and wealth. I&rsquo;m very attached to my house and my savings and financial investments.</p>
<p>I could go on and on, but this article is an utter misrepresentation of the facts and climate of recent Chinese immigration to Canada, and more specifically, the Vancouver area.</p>

		<p>One day here in Las Vegas a Chinese couple came in and if they had been wearing masks I would have thought they were White. They spoke perfect &#8220;Canadian&#8221; saying &#8220;eh&#8221; at the end of every sentence. My jaw hit the floor. They were even wearing flannel. They were the Whitest Chinese Canadians in the world. True story!</p>

		<p>Many white people who live in these cities would disagree with this assessment.  White Nationalism, first and foremost, is about opposition to race replacement.  We don&rsquo;t want to be displaced by anyone, even if some alien races are better behaved than others.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Most Chinese immigrants say they feel strongly attached to Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>No doubt, no doubt. It seems most non-western immigrants seem &#8220;strongly attached&#8221; to the Western nations they go to. Is this a good thing? Who knows? China is extremely ambitious to become a world power. Does having Chinese in a Western nation like Canada make Canada safer in light of this? Does it make the U.S. safer, (considering all the homegrown traitors on Wall Street and elsewhere that we already have) having Canada, right next door, filled with Chinese? These are some of the questions that the elite and the so-called elected leaders in Canada and the U.S. never ask themselves. They all live in a rose-colored glasses kind of world. Government servants should be watched like hawks, by both Canadians and Americans, if they really cared about their respective nations. </p>

		<p>My comment is loosely related to this story. I own a franchise restaurant, part of a very large chain which prudence tells me should be left nameless.  The chain has a monthly newsletter which contains several group photos of restaurant crews in the US and Canada.  Most restaurants in the chain are owned by whites and the crews are mainly white with some blacks and Mexicans.  There are lots of Asian Indian owners, too.  Some Indians hire only other Indians, but most put Indians in charge and fill their staffs with whites and Mexicans.  Few East Asians are franchisees, but they are the only ones who hire only their own people if they can manage it.<br>
Here is how this relates: I saw a picture of a large restaurant crew.  The crew numbered about 20 or 25 people and every member was Chinese.  They weren&rsquo;t obviously American-born types with names like Jimmy Chang, Anna Wong and so forth; these were people with three character names rendered in pinyin. I assumed it was a photo of a store in Asia, but the caption said E</p>

		<p>I find it hard to believe that the Chinese/Japanese/Koreans have higher AVERAGE IQ&rsquo;s than White people.  It&rsquo;s true that the people from those ethnic groups who migrate to the US, Canada, etc. are very intelligent (they have the brains, the money, etc. to succeed in Western societies), but I have a hard time believing that the AVERAGE person in Korea, Japan, China, etc. has a higher IQ than European Whites.  I just find it hard to believe.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget, either, that in Lynn&rsquo;s &#8216;IQ and the Wealth of Nations&rsquo;, he found several widely different IQ&rsquo;s of China (some were in the early 90&rsquo;s), yet he based it on 100 for&hellip;who knows what reason.  AND, those were the IQ&rsquo;s of Chinese IN CHINA&rsquo;S MAJOR CITIES (Beijing, Shanghai, etc.).  Go to the rural areas of China (where most Chinese live) and measure the IQ there&hellip;I won&rsquo;t bet that it will be any higher than even Balkan Europeans/Turkish people (who have the lowest IQ&rsquo;s in Europe).</p>

		<p>This article, like so many others, is published to lull us into a state of complacency with the Asian invasion. </p>
<p>The accompanying photo contradicts the article - a &#8216;Chinese mall&rsquo; in Canada, where the signs are in Chinese and the language of commerce is Chinese.  </p>
<p>Rather than &#8216;assimilating&rsquo;, Chinese in Canada seem to be biding their time, while maintaining their Chinese-ness in suspension.  As they grow more powerful in numbers, mirroring their motherland&rsquo;s ascending the world stage, the pushier they become.</p>

		<p>I would never go back to live in Vancouver (where I once lived), largely on account of the Hong Kong immigration invasion. These people were rather smart, prosperous, and didn&rsquo;t drag down the neighborhoods per se. But their contempt for white people and western culture was appalling, to say the least. It was my exposure to Chinese immigrants to Canada that resulted in my white racial awakening. Need I say more?</p>

		<p>Canada should look to Malaysia to get a glimpse of its future.</p>
<p>The Chinese have been migrating to Malaysia since the fifteenth century, retaining their Chinese political, cultural and linguistic distinctness.  They make up some 25 - 30 percent of the population of Malaysia.</p>
<p>If Canada doesn&rsquo;t halt Chinese migration, it will face a serious challenge to its sovereignty from mainland China. Chinese in Canada are loyal to their race (as evidenced by their obsequious deference to visiting Chinese officials from the motherland). </p>
<p>The culture that invented kowtowing commands that all Chinese, regardless of geographic home on the globe, submit unquestioningly to the national cause.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never read such absolute rubbish as this article.  Chinese would have to be one of the worst groups regarding assimilation into a host country. </p>
<p>If that article is true (and according to Canadians who have posted comments here, it&rsquo;s totally false), then the behaviour of Chinese in Canada is directly opposite to those here in Australia. </p>

		<p>I think 1- Richard hit the nail on the head. When I take public transport, which on the routes I travel is usually at least 1/2 full with Asians, I often can&rsquo;t hear myself think under the din of Mandarin and Cantonese being spoken (they have a cultural habit of speaking very loudly), and I know many people who feel the same way. I would agree that most people living in areas with a large Chinese population would dismiss this article as multicultural feel-good rubbish.</p>

		<p>And then throw East Indians into the mix, who battle viciously with the Chinese in Malaysia as witnessed by savage riots in Singapore during the 1960s.</p>
<p>So we whites are merely transforming Vancouver into a veritable Singapore, where we sit back and arrange a functional Western infrastructure while the modern-day equivalent of coolies fight it out in backalleys until they make the city unliveable for Chinese&hellip;</p>
<p>Or you go back further in time to the plains of Siberia that stretched above North India into China, where the roving Aryans once decamped&hellip;the Indians intermarried with them, but the Chinese murdered them, after absorbing Indo-European technologies&hellip;and that, my friends, is the future of the past.</p>

<p>How convenient for a newly-arrived Chinese immigrant who doesn&rsquo;t work in a &#8220;real job&#8221;, but is employed in a role funded by Canadian taxpayers to displace even more Canadians in their own country. </p>
<p>How does a country composed of only 33,000,000 people compete with the likes of a mega-populated nation like China?</p>
<p>Note the number of China&rsquo;s new births, <i>just in the last five years</i>, are equal to the entire population of Canada!</p>

		<p>I definitely agree with Asians not having the same average IQ. I taught adults in South Korea - most of my students were &#8216;university graduates&rsquo;, many from universities in the U.S., England, Australia, etc. </p>
<p>I was totally blown away by their lack of common sense, understanding of logic and reason, world knowledge (Koreans are incredibly insular and have no interest in any countries but their own), and creativity. Ask them to think independently and you will get nothing but blank stares. I&rsquo;ve taught high school students in the U.S. and I can say with experience that the average high school student in America is far more intelligent than the average college graduate in Korea, and it is not because of a language barrier - many of my students were nearly fluent in English. </p>
<p>Just to give you an idea, I once had a student insist with such vehemency that Korea was bigger than Japan that he quit the class after I rightfully proved him wrong in front of everyone. This was a &#8216;university&rsquo; student.  </p>

<p>I have never ever met any Korean person or Japanese person or Chinese person who thought Korea was bigger than Japan, regardless of age.  When Korean kids enter elementary schools, there is a map of Asia and a map of the entire world in every classroom in South Korea and the kids have to look at the map all the time and it does not take more than two seconds to realize Japan is bigger than Korea&hellip;.  </p>
<p>I have a thorough interest in Western Europe, such as German cars and Neo-Gothic architecture.  My favourite architectural work on the planet is the Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, Germany.  A few of my white friends were surprised when I was able to correctly spell and pronounce the German castle&rsquo;s name while my English language skills weren&rsquo;t perfect.</p>
<p>A few more of the architectural works I really admire and located in Europe&hellip;.</p>
<p>Brandenburg Gate (Berlin)<br>
Notre Dame Cathedral (Paris)<br>
Eiffel Tower (looks especially unbelievable at night)<br>
Charlottenburg Palace (Germany, do not remember which city)<br>
Schloss Schonbrunn (Vienna, Austria I have to put a couple of dots on top of the letter o on Schonbrunn.  Schloss means &#8220;palace&#8221;)<br>
Parliament building (Vienna, Austria)<br>
Opera house (Vienna, Austria.  yeah, I know there&rsquo;s one in Australia as well)</p>
<p>I am sure a few AmRen members paid visits to a few of those places. </p>
<p>The architectural works I love most in Canada are&hellip; both are in Ottawa.  The Parliament Building and the National Gallery of Canada.  </p>
<p>When I went to San Francisco a few years ago, I met a beautiful German girl on a ferry.  I asked her what BMW stood for and she told me Bayerische Motoren Werks.  </p>
<p>This is&hellip;  a picture of Strasbourg, France I modified slightly with Adobe Photoshop 7.0</p>
<p><a href="https://img3.imageshack.us/img3/9838/ft50pwbdbta5.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://img3.imageshack.us/img3/9838/ft50pwbdbta5.jpg</a></p>
<p>(if graduates from colleges in US, Australia, England lack common sense, aren&rsquo;t those colleges partially responsible?)</p>
<p>and I also spent a weekend in Orangeville (outside of Toronto in Ontario) riding horses and noticed it was very beautiful there as well.  </p>
<p>I have never ever measured my IQ, nor do I have any interest to know what my IQ is.  The human brain is too complicated to use a three digit number to describe its value.  It is more than 500 times more complicated than the latest Intel mobile CPU.  If somebody says Robert(my name) your IQ must be a two digit number then be my guest I guess it is a two digit number I don&rsquo;t care the human brain is too complicated to describe using a number anyways.  </p>

		<p>I live in California and there are many Asians here. I don&rsquo;t believe in immigration because i don&rsquo;t want to be overpopulated, but I am often impressed with these communities. Most Chinese and Vietnamese I&rsquo;ve met abhor communism, and only want their children to learn English. Many are Christian. Even the non-Christians will celebrate Christmas because they enjoy the American tradition. I drove by a Vietnamese supermarket in Little Saigon. There was a huge mural of an American Eagle with an American Flag.It read &#8220;God Bless America&#8221;. You would NEVER see that on a Mexican supermarket. Come to think of it, you would not often see that in a White area either. In Little Saigon, they fly American Flags and South Vietnamese flags. A shop owner once tried to display a communist North Vietnamese flag&hellip;a riot of Vietnamese people assembled outside of his door. They broke his windows and threatened to kill him. The police were needed to safely evacuate him. The white liberals in LA were screaming at how horrible this was&hellip;America is a free country and we appease and apologize to communist Vietnam. The actual Vietnamese people feel differently.</p>
<p>Asian communities aren&rsquo;t perfect. Organized crime exists, they aren&rsquo;t always clean, and they are often bad drivers.  Generally speaking they  are fairly decent people and even patriotic to the U.S.. Other large immigrant groups are generally not patriotic to the U.S.. White liberals are actually the worst of the group&hellip;traitors and the enemy from within.</p>
