<h1>Suspects in Deputy Slaying Nabbed, Asleep in Beaver County Shed</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Havnes, Salt Lake Tribune, January 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 37-hour manhunt through several counties ended swiftly and peacefully Wednesday morning when a tip led Beaver County deputies to two men wanted in the death of a Millard County sheriff&rsquo;s deputy.</p>
<p>Roberto Miramontes Roman and Ruben Chavez Reyes were sleeping in a shed in northern Beaver about 8:15 a.m. when SWAT officers rushed in and arrested the pair.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Roman, 37, is suspected of fatally shooting Millard County sheriff&rsquo;s Deputy Josie Fox after she stopped his vehicle at 1 a.m. Tuesday on U.S. Highway 50 in Delta.</p>
<p>Roman has been charged with capital murder and tampering with evidence and could face the death penalty if convicted. He was taken to the Millard County jail in anticipation of an arraignment today in Fillmore&rsquo;s 4th District Court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Millard County Sheriff Robert Dekker said Chavez Reyes would be interviewed but did not know if any charges would be sought against him. He said police are looking for others who may have aided Roman.</p>
<p>Chavez Reyes, 36, was in custody on an immigration hold, according to Lindsay Mitchell, public information officer for the Millard County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. Both men are Mexican nationals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fox, a 37-year-old mother of two, was gunned down about 1 a.m. Tuesday about one mile east of Delta, shortly after she pulled over a 1995 gray Cadillac Deville driven by Roman. Sheriff&rsquo;s investigators say Roman shot and killed her with a bullet that entered her chest just above her protective vest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration officials said Wednesday that both Roman and Chavez Reyes are Mexican nationals who are in the United States illegally.</p>
<p>According to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Roman was admitted to the United States legally in 1990, but was deported in 1998 to his native country because of criminal convictions.</p>
<p>He was arrested twice after that for illegally re-entering the United States and prosecuted in 2005 in U.S. District Court in Arizona for that offense, according to ICE. Court records show he was sentenced to 150 days in prison.</p>
<p>Utah state court records show that Roman has a significant criminal history, beginning in 1992 with a misdemeanor drug distribution charge to which he pleaded guilty in Fillmore. In 1996 and 1997, Roman was charged in Millard County in two different cases with a handful of felonies, including drug charges, receiving stolen property and a weapons count.</p>
<p>He was sent to prison for up to 15 years after pleading guilty to one count of second-degree felony drug possession with intent to distribute and one count of third-degree felony drug possession.</p>
<p>In the 1996 case, an informant told police he had been selling drugs for Roman for about a year, according to a search warrant affidavit filed in 4th District Court. The informant also told police he had traded a Tech 9 mm semi-automatic pistol to Roman for drugs, and that he believed Roman kept the weapon and a cache of illegal drugs in a back bedroom of his Delta area trailer home.</p>
<p>On Sept. 15, 1998, Roman was released from prison into the custody of immigration authorities and deported.</p>

		<p>So in a 1996 case that resulted in an &#8220;up to 15 year sentence&#8221; Roman was released to immigration in Sept. 1998 and deported. Sounds like a deal that wouldn&rsquo;t be available to a US citizen felon convict on the same charges. Chalk it up to &#8220;equal protection&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Arrested TWICE for illegally re-entering the US. Just goes to show what a freaking JOKE our border security is. Someone with the Federal Government should be made to personally explain to these two children why they no longer have a mother.</p>
<p>Finish building that wall and place the military there and allow them to shoot to kill anything that tries to cross it. Period. </p>

		<p>I would not be opposed to repatriation of criminals to their country of origin if there was some assurance that they would not be able to re-enter so easily, and, that if found, were subjected to harsh and brutal treatment. Unfortunately, illegals see us as patsys who let them out from prison early, and then do nothing that would make them think twice about coming back.</p>
<p>There is no percentage in rehabilitating or being fair towards illegals. By their coming here illegally, and by their disregard for our laws, they deserve none of our sympathy.</p>

		<p>On last night&rsquo;s newscast here in Salt Lake, the news reader said that this case was sparking a debate on immigration in Utah.  I thought &#8220;Can the MSN finally be picking up on the immigration disaster?&#8221;  Alas, the story instantly cut to the head of the local Hispanic pressure group, who spouted the usual PC garbage.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In May, Roman set up a page on the social networking site MySpace that shows numerous pictures of him holding firearms. Among the weapons are two .45 caliber handguns and an AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifle. Roman, of Delta, posted his last entry there Sunday, characterizing his mood as &#8220;crazy&#8221; and saying he was &#8220;ready for whatever is next.&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p><br>
They are supposedly &#8220;living in the shadows&#8221;, yet they have MySpace pages?</p>

		<p>It breaks my heart to know that Utah is a screwed up as the rest of us.  I always counted Utah and Idaho as part of my escape plan, but I spent some time north of St. George over the holiday and was shocked to see Latino markets, restaurants, and signage in Spanish.  And don&rsquo;t get me started on my trip to Tennessee last year, as it was the same story there.</p>
<p>I know there is a lot of resistance to counting illegals during the 2010 census, but I say let &#8216;em be counted.  I believe that citizens will be shocked at how quickly this country was invaded.  And if hell breaks loose in Mexico as a result of the drug wars there, the refugees pouring in will be the end of us.</p>

		<p>Caught the story (link below) on MSN NEWS. The perp exposing himself to children and women   &mdash;   is described as &#8220;WHITE&#8221;, but his features spell Mexican to me. This seems like a textbook example of how crime stats are deliberately skewed to make Mexican illegals appear NOT to be doing the many crimes we&rsquo;re aware they&rsquo;re committing.</p>
