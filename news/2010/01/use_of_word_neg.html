			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Katie McFadden and Larry McShane, New York Daily News, January 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The census form for 2010 features a word more often heard in 1966: Negro.</p>
<p>For many New York blacks, the word conjures visions of Jim Crow and segregation  &mdash;  even if the Census Bureau says it&rsquo;s included to ensure an accurate count of the nation&rsquo;s minority residents.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a bad vibe word,&#8221; said Kevin Bishop, 45, a Brooklyn salesman. &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t agree with me, doesn&rsquo;t agree with my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pamela Reese Smith, visiting the city yesterday from Rochester, said the term was outdated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think my ancestors would appreciate it in 2010,&#8221; said Smith, 56. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want my grandchildren being called Negroes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Question No. 9 on this year&rsquo;s census form asks about race, with one of the answers listed as &#8220;black, African-Am. or Negro.&#8221;</p>
<p>Census Bureau spokesman Jack Martin said the use of &#8220;Negro&#8221; was intended as a term of inclusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many older African-Americans identified themselves that way, and many still do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those who identify themselves as Negroes need to be included.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The N-word branched out of Negro.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. These days, African-Americans wouldn&rsquo;t like the term.&#8221;</p>

		<p>ANY word that means &#8220;black person&#8221; eventually comes to have bad connotations, and approaches the status of a cuss word.  That is because of what the word is associated with - black people.</p>

<p>And this was not in the 1950&rsquo;s or even now deemed as a term that was disrespectful in any manner.</p>

		<p>1 WR the elder has it right: any word that means Black will eventually become a slur, because it will be used as one.  People need a word to describe what they see, and if AfAm is the only word permitted, it will come to mean the same thing that now forbidden words do.  </p>

		<p>Comment #1, WD, hit it on the mark. Any name associated with them eventually becomes tarnished.  They keep changing their designation with every generation, running away from who they are.  You&rsquo;ll NEVER please them.</p>

		<p>Another absurd image of a black I caught was in some sort of commercial featuring American farmers. When I first saw this commercial several weeks ago there were only white farmers and farm families out in their fields with alternating clips of them working and smiling for the camera. Recently, they inserted a five second clip toward the end of the spot of a middle aged black guy&rsquo;s face. It&rsquo;s just a close up of his face looking out into the distance - nothing more. The little background that can be seen is completely blurred out but it is a light earth tone to imply he&rsquo;s a farmer but he could be standing in a city park for all we know or on the edge of the parking lot outside the ad agency&rsquo;s building. I thought it was pretty pathetic.</p>

		<p>My understanding is that the offending word is merely Spanish for &#8220;black&#8221;.  Other racial descriptors we get from Spanish are &#8220;Mestizo&#8221;, &#8220;Mulattto&#8221; and &#8220;Zambo&#8221;.</p>
<p>I suspect the individuals who are bothered by the term are simply folks who are unhappy whenever they don&rsquo;t have something to complain about.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never gotten used to the word African-American as it sounds ridiculous coming out of the mouth of anyone of any color.  I so rarely hear it anywhere but on the MSM that it makes me bite my tongue to keep from smiling when I actually do hear it in the presence of someone.  In another ten years that word will become a racial slur being replaced with something else like Royal Nubians or MEPS (Melanin Enhanced Persons).  </p>

I even get the feeling that the White people who use it feel awkward.<br>
We should insist on being called Euro-Americans. Indians (from India) should be called Sub-Continental Asian Americans.<br>

		<p>I agree that &#8220;African American&#8221; is absolutely ridiculous. Black people know little if anything about Africa and their culture in the United States doesn&rsquo;t really come from Africa. Upon arriving in the Western Hemisphere, black Africans were forcibly stripped of their names, culture, language, as well as their racial purity. The vast majority of black Americans wouldn&rsquo;t be considered black in most other nations around the world due to the fact that the vast majority of them have a substantial percentage of white blood. Much of what we think of as &#8220;black culture&#8221; was partially shaped by poor southern whites and their unique experience in the United States. They lost whatever African heritage they had. I could also go on a tirade against the term &#8220;people of color,&#8221; but that&rsquo;s for another time!</p>

<p>You have it backwards.  A white with as little as one drop of black blood is considered to be a black (damaged goods).  Obama himself is half white and he rightly defines himself as black.</p>
<p>Very few white slave owners mated with their unappetizing female black slaves.  The black slave&rsquo;s racial and cultural purity has remained intact to this day as evidenced by the fact that American blacks have always committed a grossly disproportionate percentage (the majority) of crimes in America&hellip;<br>
