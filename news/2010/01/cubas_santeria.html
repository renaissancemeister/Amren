<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-latinamerica/20100102/CB.Cuba.New.Year_s.Prediction/">Cuba&rsquo;s Santeria Priests See Unrest in 2010</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Haven, Comcast News, Jan. 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A panel of Afro-Cuban priests are predicting a year of social and political unrest, struggles for power, treachery and coups d&rsquo;etat, and they say the world will see the death of an inordinate number of political leaders in 2010.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The older generations should pass their experience on to young people because times change, and the younger generation is better prepared,&#8221; said Victor Bentancourt, one of the island&rsquo;s leading Santeria priests, or babalawos. &#8220;Time is growing short&#8221; for such a change.</p>
<p>The priests announced their forecast following a secretive New Year&rsquo;s Eve ritual in which they performed religious chants and sacrificed chickens, goats and other animals.</p>
<p>A rival Santeria group, which enjoys official sanction from the government, came out with its own predictions later Saturday, saying 2010 would be a year of improving health.</p>
<p>Santeria, which mixes Catholicism with the traditional African Yoruba faith, is followed by many people in Cuba, where about a third of the 11.2 million population is of African descent.</p>
<p>The ceremony in Cuba is one of several New Year&rsquo;s religious traditions in Latin America. Indigenous shamans in Peru last week performed good-luck rituals for peace in 2010, asking for eased tensions between Venezuela and Colombia and for President Barack Obama to normalize U.S.-Cuba relations.</p>
<p>Mexico&rsquo;s &#8220;Brujo Mayor&#8221; or &#8220;Great Witch&#8221; is scheduled to announce his predictions on world events and celebrity affairs on Monday, and Venezuela&rsquo;s Santeria priests are expected to make their own New Year&rsquo;s predictions.</p>
<p>Cuba&rsquo;s communist government has tolerated Santeria and other religious practices for years, though it long denied religious leaders official recognition. In the 1990s the government began to allow greater religious freedoms, and today even some members of the Communist Party openly practice Santeria.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The priests said their religious ceremony revealed 2010 to be the year of Baba Eyiobe, a Santeria sign that means &#8220;double salvation,&#8221; as well as the divinities Obatala and Oya.</p>
<p>According to Santeria teachings, Obatala is a female divinity responsible for the creation of human beings, as well as the patron of reason and intelligence. Oya is the goddess of storms and wind, as well as ancestral spirits.</p>
<p>In 2009, the priests predicted a year of conflict between neighboring countries and warned of the necessity to foment respect within families.</p>
<p>Another priest, Lazaro Cuesta, stressed that Santeria does not teach that the year end predictions are fated to occur, and that there is still time for the world to avoid the unrest and conflict forecast in the ceremony.</p>
<p>&#8220;The future is in all of our hands, from the youngest child to the most powerful leaders,&#8221; he said.<br>

		<p>I was hoping to predict the major events of 2010 by sacrificing a turkey.  Can anyone tell me if I should make the predictions with the stuffing in the bird or out?  </p>
<p>It is amazing that there are still so many primitives in the 21st century.</p>

<p>That these mental defects are not prosecuted harshly for cruelty to animals is the clearest indication we have of how much this despicable empire has deteriorated.</p>

		<p>When the little boy Elian was the subject of controversy, the whole episode had something to in part with a prediction made by one of these priests of the Santeria movement? Rickey Ricardo [Desi Arnaz] when he sang to &#8220;Babulu&#8221; was talking to the god of the Santeria practitioners.</p>

		<p>  You don&rsquo;t need to know your Hoodoo from Voodoo to believe these Santeria predictions. It&rsquo;s just common sense. We are in tough times and I don&rsquo;t see us coming out of them for the next few years&hellip;if ever. Funny, black folks down South have been practicing &#8220;root&#8221; since slave days. Sometimes they chalk grave stones or leave plates with coins in the graveyard, or put knives under their beds, etc. Ju-Ju is widely believed among the black folks in the rural (and even urban) South. I don&rsquo;t mess with it and I don&rsquo;t see it changing anytime soon. </p>

<p>Right. Root medicine. You take two small draw string bags. Fill them with earth from a graveyard, put a fresh piece of root from a plant in the bag with the dirt and also place in the bag a piece of paper with the cursed persons name on. Place one bag where the person can find it, and hide the other bag. As the root withers, so shall that person wither.</p>
<p>Juju!</p>
