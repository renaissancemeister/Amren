<h1>Interest Soars on Adopting Haitian Orphans</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Orkin Emmanuel, Dallas Morning News, January 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tammy Gage of Stanberry, Mo., cries every time she turns on the TV and sees the devastation in Haiti. And though she already has three daughters, she didn&rsquo;t hesitate when her husband suggested that they adopt from Haiti.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s all he needed to say,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Gage and her husband, Brad, are among many Americans expressing interest in adopting children who have been left orphans from the quake last week. Adoption advocacy groups are reporting dozens of calls a day.</p>
<p>&#8220;The agencies are being flooded with phone calls and e-mails,&#8221; said Tom Difilipo, president and chief executive of the advocacy group Joint Council on International Children&rsquo;s Services. &#8220;The response is &#8216;Can we help with these children by adopting them?&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>The need is vast. Even before the magnitude-7.0 earthquake, Haiti, one of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries, had 380,000 orphans, according to UNICEF. There is no counting of children newly orphaned by the quake, but aid groups estimate that they number in the tens of thousands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody here and in the world wants to do something. I think it&rsquo;s a way that people are opening up their heads and their hearts,&#8221; said Mary Ross Agosta, spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of Miami, which has offered temporary housing for children until they are either placed with extended family, put in foster care or adopted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The orphans coming to the U.S. now are children who either had already established a relationship with potential parents in the country or who were certified as orphans before the quake but hadn&rsquo;t been placed with parents, said Chris Bentley, a U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services spokesman.</p>
<p>Before new adoptions can occur, officials need to establish that the children are identified by the Haitian government as orphans, and potential families need to be cleared, too.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security has set up an e-mail address for information on Haitian adoptions, haitianadoptions@dhs.gov, where people can get questions answered about ongoing adoptions. Bentley also said there will be a task force to help Haitian children come into the U.S. for adoption.</p>

								<h2>Orphans Soon to Arrive in Canada</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Trish Audette and Andrea Sands, Edmonton Journal, January 24, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>After a week-and-a-half wondering when her new little girl would finally arrive from Haiti, Bonnie Winarski of Fort Saskatchewan got the news she has been waiting for.</p>
<p>Winarski&rsquo;s adopted daughter, 22-month-old Sarah-Marie, is expected to fly into Montreal on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t quite know the time yet on Monday. All I know is she&rsquo;s coming in on Monday,&#8221; Winarski said Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m feeling way better than I have in days because this is the most firm information that I&rsquo;ve had in two weeks, just about, since the earthquake  &mdash;  that my daughter, for sure, is coming home and there is actually a flight that is planned for her. I&rsquo;m elated, in that regard.&#8221;</p>
<p>A liaison with God&rsquo;s Littlest Angels orphanage in Haiti contacted Winarski on Saturday to tell her Sarah-Marie will be on the Montreal-bound flight carrying about 20 children from the orphanage to their adoptive families in Canada.</p>
<p>Winarski and her fiance plan to fly to Montreal today so they are in the city when their little girl arrives.</p>
<p>Winarski said she doesn&rsquo;t know how things will unfold once her daughter&rsquo;s flight gets in to Montreal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that, from what happened in the States, the kids had to be processed through immigration before they were allowed to see their parents, and so I know a lot of the parents were at the airport at the same time as their kids, but it took about 10 hours before they let the parents see their children,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no idea what the immigration process is going to be like in Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>Winarski started trying to adopt a child from Haiti three and a half years ago. Nearly two years ago, she was matched with Sarah-Marie, who was a month old.</p>
<p>Winarski was in the final stages of the adoption process and getting packed to go to Haiti when the earthquake hit Jan. 12.</p>
<p>As many as 24 Haitian orphans destined to join their Albertan families are expected to arrive in Canada this weekend.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we know is that this weekend, families in Alberta will begin to see their children,&#8221; Children&rsquo;s Services Minister Yvonne Fritz said Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that parents have been very anxious.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It&rsquo;s been very traumatic for parents, for their children to be in a country that&rsquo;s had such devastation with this earthquake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twenty-one Alberta families expect their children to arrive in Canada in the days to come, some as soon as Sunday.</p>
<p>The families involved have been waiting for their children for as long as two years, as adoption documents were being finalized in Haiti.</p>
<p>Each year, Alberta families welcome an average 20 Haitian orphans. There has been a renewed emphasis, however, on speeding up the process since the earthquake in the ravaged developing nation. Alberta Justice and Alberta Children&rsquo;s Services are working with the families and federal government.</p>
<p>&#8220;They want their children home as soon as possible,&#8221; Fritz said of the Alberta families. &#8220;There&rsquo;s a lot of excitement in the air now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s such good news that our children are being united with their families and their loved ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are 154 chi ldren who were in the final stages of adoption by Canadian families prior to the earthquake, which is now estimated to have killed as many as 200,000 people. At least 18 Canadians are among the dead, the federal government said Saturday.</p>
<p>Ottawa has been reviewing these pending adoptions &#8220;to determine what steps may be taken to process the cases while respecting Haitian laws,&#8221; Citizenship and Immigration spokeswoman Kelli Fraser said.</p>
<p>Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has directed officials to issue temporary resident permits so Haitian children can live with their adoptive Canadian parents before all legal steps for adoption are completed, Fraser said. However, she said, the ministry is avoiding shortcuts &#8220;that could enable unscrupulous people to obtain children for the purpose of human trafficking.&#8221;</p>
<p>A first planeload of Haitian children will arrive in Ottawa at 6:30 a.m. local time today, Kenney said Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our ministry is working at getting as many of the adopted children out of Haiti as quickly as possible,&#8221; he said.<br>

		<p> The Haitian government   &mdash;   what there is left of it, that is   &mdash;   can&rsquo;t police the streets, bury the dead, or even give more than a vague guess at how many ARE dead; but yet it&rsquo;s going to tell these adoption agencies which children really are orphans? Would anyone but a bleeding-heart liberal reporter accept that without just a touch of cynicism?</p>
<p> And by the way, did anyone notice how careful the reporter was not to give any hint at the race of the couple that is so eager to adopt these cute, helpless little orphaned Haitians? Rest assured, they were White   &mdash;   along with the vast majority of the other couples who want to throw open their homes to these kids. What ever happened to those black adoption advocates of a few years ago who insisted that only black couples be allowed to adopt black children? Nowhere to be seen when we need them.</p>

		<p>Mental illness among whites is rampent.  Donate money but please do not bring them into your home or my country.  And if you are so fired up about adopting a black baby there are tons of American black children sitting, unwanted, in foster care.  Black kids that BLACKS do not want.  Even paying blacks to take black babies doesn&rsquo;t work (most states have subsidized adoption programs so that low-income folks can adopt).</p>

<p>And I am sure, that the fashionably maudlin fools will adopt an adolescent Haitian boy who might rape one, or all three, of their daughters if given half the chance. Of course (hopefully) they won&rsquo;t, even though this hypothetical teenaged orphan is in about as great a need as a newborn Haitian baby. So too, might not a 40-year-old Haitian criminal, freshly escaped from a<br>
collapsed prison, be considered needful enough for &ldquo;adoption,&rdquo; if you were just able to open your: home, hearts, and daughters, up to such an unfortunate as well, right?</p>
<p>I know, it wouldn&rsquo;t have the same quality of warm fuzziness as does the newborn, but hey what difference does that make, if Christian &ldquo;charity&rdquo; and not casual social sanctimony are what you really seek?</p>
<p>In fact, why not solve this altruistic dilemma by taking in one Haitian of every age and sex possible into your home? </p>
<p>Of course you won&rsquo;t; once they hit 18 you expect the American taxpayers to fund such efforts, right?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is&hellip;why turn Canada Haitian a little at a time through scattered adoptions? Why not invite whole Haitian families to move in? Heck, you could send a fleet of cruise ships to Haiti, show Haitians pictures of how beautiful Ottawa is (now) and have boatloads of Haitians in Ottawa by next week! They even speak a type of (creole) French, which is sure to please Quebecois!</p>
<p>If turning Ottawa Haitian in dribs and drabs is a good idea, why not turn it Haitian all at once? If Canadians can see how stupid that idea is, why can they not see how stupid their current policy is?</p>
<p><i>Haiti, one of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries, had 380,000 orphans</i></p>
<p>I wonder if this includes those children of poor Haitian families who are sold as slaves to wealthier Haitians, a common practice in that miserable country?</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t this just great. I am so tired of hearing about Haiti and how it is ALWAYS the White sheeple who are there aiding them and pouring in the $$$$ and now adopting these Haitian kids. I believe these Whites who adopt nonwhite kids have some sort of mental disorder and want to &#8220;feel good&#8221; about themselves for some stupid reason or else they HATE their own Whiteness and feel guilty about being White. </p>
<p>On our local talk show today of course they talked about this and EVERY caller  said it was wonderful and they are thinking of adopting one or two of them themselves! Even the host of the show said they have 2 small daughters and he and wife started talking about adopting a Haitian boy. Isn&rsquo;t that sweet? </p>
<p> To top it off the mother-in-law heard about what they may do and is pushing them to adopt one so that she can have a GRANDSON! A black grandson, not of her own blood, and have him as a &#8220;brother&#8221; to her two little White grandaughters? Something id definitely wrong with this thinking!</p>
<p> Even a black caller called and said how great it is, yet I notice that he did not mention adopting one himself!  Ever notice that? It is ALWAYS Whites who adopt nonwhites and never a minority who ever adopts one of their own?  My blood pressure was going through the roof so I had to turn that station off!</p>

		<p>How come there are no mass adoptions for Orphaned children from the Balkans War, in the early to mid 1990s? </p>
<p>I see no lines of anxious Upper Middle Class Liberal Whites waiting to adopt White children from Serbia, and Kosovo. Why?</p>

		<p>When natural disasters hit countries like the United States and Canada, I don&rsquo;t notice people clamoring to leave those countries as soon as possible, nor other nations stepping up to provide assistance. When a nasty ice storm stuck eastern Canada in 1998 and left some people deprived of electricity for nearly a month, as well as causing severe economic disruption, people coped and got on with their lives. And the damage was repaired as effectively and as soon as possible. That was because white people know how to step up to the plate. The same does not seem true of blacks (New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina being a prime example). As was seen when blacks from New Orleans were relocated in Houston or Atlanta, they simply brought all their crime and related problems with them. Does anybody think that it&rsquo;s going to be different with Haitians, including little black babies? You can raise a lion cub among a bunch of peaceful sheep, but the lion&rsquo;s DNA and basic instincts won&rsquo;t change, and when it grows up, it&rsquo;ll be a ferocious carnivore that may very well turn on, and devour, the sheep it grew up among. That&rsquo;s the analogy I see as being most appropriate when I hear of white people clamoring to adopt black babies.<br>

		<p>These people are foolish, disgusting, and deeply stupid.  Foolish for making a life-changing decision on the basis of TV pictures.  Disgusting for choosing a Black foreigner when there are White kids in their own state who need homes.  Deeply stupid for bringing Haitian chaos into their lives.  It&rsquo;s pure moral posturing, vanity wearing a mask of charity.  Nobody notices you when you go out in public with your White adopted kid, but if you&rsquo;ve got a Black pet, everyone can see that you&rsquo;re one of those saintly liberals.  It&rsquo;s even better than an Obama sticker on your car for displaying your moral virtue, because it&rsquo;s much more exclusive.  Anyone can get a sticker for a few bucks, but there are only 380,000 lucky and virtuous White Americans who will have the opportunity to get their own Haitian.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll bet that nearly all the teary eyed people lining up to adopt a Haitian child are white.  You could probably fit all the blacks doing this in my bathroom.</p>
<p>Well, this could make for another opportunity to do a nature-nurture study.  Let&rsquo;s see how those Haitian kids do academically relative to the biological children of the adopting parents.</p>

		<p>I was watching CNN and saw a segment on children from Haiti and their (white) adoptive parents.  There was something disturbingly unnatural about it.  These whites seemed to be over the top with their &#8220;love&#8221; for these children they had never met.  I couldn&rsquo;t help but think they were putting on a show.  It makes no sense for anyone to adopt a child from Haiti.  If you want to adopt a black child, there are plenty here in America who are in desperate need of a family, considering blacks won&rsquo;t even take care of their own.  </p>
<p>My guess is that these pathetic, white adoptive parents get some sort of self-gratification from walking down the street with a black child in their arms.  It shows the world that they are &#8220;tolerant,&#8221; progressive,&#8221; and it makes it obvious that they have adopted, which I guess makes them feel like good people.  The fact that the child came from somewhere &#8220;exotic&#8221; like Haiti is bonus points because it gives them something else to talk about with strangers while they are at Gymboree or Baby Gap buying expensive clothes to wrap around their exotic pet. </p>
<p>No doubt, in a few years they will be spending thousands on private tutors and still not understanding why the kid can&rsquo;t keep up with the other kids at his private school.  When the kid grows into a teenager and starts getting into trouble and sexually assaulting the white girls at school, the parents will insist that their child is innocent and the accusers are just being &#8220;racist.&#8221;  Either that or some hidden trauma from living through an earthquake as an infant is causing them to act out.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s right.  </p>
<p>Hey liberal White women, now&rsquo;s your chance.  Oh those poor Haitian babies.  If ever they needed a mama, they need one now.  Liberal White women who don&rsquo;t have any children of your own because you don&rsquo;t want to burden the world with any more people, here&rsquo;s your opportunity to assist those poor Black Haitians.  Please have a little sympathy, oh won&rsquo;t you?  Please adopt as many as you can.  Please raise them and give them everything you would have given to your own biological children.  If ever they needed you, they need you now.  Simply forsake your own race so that they can partake of the good things in life - At our expense of course.<br>

		<p>It isn&rsquo;t liberals who are doing this to us,not to mention to there own children. No, it is overwhelmingly evangelical christians. This &#8220;religion&#8221; has degenerated into a third world adoption cult and the preachers, most of whom are gay, are behind it. These sheeple are not our friends. Do yourself a favor and aquaint yourself with the pagan ethos of the Greeks, Romans, Vikings, and the American Founding Fathers. Become a hero and despise these losers.</p>

Either that or some hidden trauma from living through an earthquake as an infant is causing them to act out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well stated.  Now, why can&rsquo;t people think rationally and learn from anecdote and experience, rather than giving into a momentary whim?  Can&rsquo;t they foresee the disaster and disappointment that lies ahead?  This constant need for some whites to adopt children from places like Africa and Asia is something I can never wrap my mind around.  When was the last time we&rsquo;ve heard of someone from Japan adopting a Serbian?<br>
 <br>
Even blacks in America don&rsquo;t want to adopt Haitian babies.  They would rather amuse themselves watching whites make this sad mistake.  Who can blame them for laughing at this spectacle?</p>

		<p>   I&rsquo;ve never understood this. If an ultra liberal couple wants a black child, there are plenty of black American children waiting to be adopted. Most of these potential white adopters are trend-following nitwits.</p>

<p>I was watching CNN and saw a segment on children from Haiti and their (white) adoptive parents. There was something disturbingly unnatural about it. These whites seemed to be over the top with their &ldquo;love&rdquo; for these children they had never met. I couldn&rsquo;t help but think they were putting on a show. It makes no sense for anyone to adopt a child from Haiti. If you want to adopt a black child, there are plenty here in America who are in desperate need of a family, considering blacks won&rsquo;t even take care of their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>To my fellow AR readers and pro-white friends, male or female, no matter what age - it is time to accept the sobering fact that whites like those who are described above, whites who care not a whit about their own people&rsquo;s survival - whites who miscegenate and who work against the interests of their fellow white brothers and sisters - these whites cannot be included or allowed to reside inside, whatever &#8216;New America&rsquo; or &#8216;whitopia&rsquo; that may arise from this miserable, degenerate racial mess of a<br>
rapidly decomposing nation.    </p>
<p>That includes, unfortunately, any of our own family members who&rsquo;ve engaged in this sort of behavior - and this reality, I am sure, will be very difficult for many whites to accept.   But we must.   </p>
<p>This poisonous lust for self-destruction, this sickness that has been deviously planted inside so many of our people&rsquo;s heads that motivates them to work tirelessly to help destroy their own race and nation, we CANNOT allow those seeds to be planted in the soil of a new White America.</p>
<p>Because, if we allow it - this process will start all over again in a few short years - and those defective white people will be adopting more Haitians and more Chinese and more whatever non-white off-spring happens to be plentiful and available, due to the lack of sexual restraint and lack of self-discipline of our ethnic competitors.</p>

		<p>strange&hellip;.the same privileged whites who go to extraordinary lengths to bear high IQ children will adopt children from a society with average IQ around 72.</p>
<p>would these elite whites adopt WHITE children with IQs of 70? I doubt it - and they would probably abort any fetus likely to be born with such low intellectual potential. </p>
<p>would you want to be adopted into a society where ther average IQ is ca 135?? </p>
<p>where you are doomed to look like a dummy no matter how hard you try?</p>
<p>these people actually believe they can make haitian children into succesful americans by giving them lots of vitamins &amp; hugs &amp; reading to them. </p>
<p>that is because they have been systematically lied to about race and IQ for 3 generations now.</p>
<p>Haitians belong in Haiti, and we should help them there. </p>

<p>It is not the evangelical Christians who are mostly gay and celebrating a social gospel, it is the mainline Protestants such as the United Methodist, Lutheran, Episcopal and Presbyterian who have mostly gay clergy and are encouraging such adoptions. The churches that are considered &#8220;fundamentalist&#8221; by detractors are not preaching such a social gospel.</p>
<p>This Haitan adoption frenzy reminds me of that horrible movie with Sacha Baron Cohen where he plays a gay man who adopts a black baby because it is the &#8220;trendy&#8221; thing to do. The baby even comes down the luggage chute in a pet type carrier. As revolting as the movie is it shows that these kids are basically little more than pets to the celebs and other libs who adopt them. I am sure that when the new wears off they are shuffled off to boarding schools or taken care of by nannies and au pairs.  </p>

		<p>This is a chance for white racial masochists to appear virtuous. As well a chance to destroy the social harmony of others they secretly despise, while appearing to exhibit a higher form of love. Again and again it is the jealousy of the Carl Marx types&hellip;that camoflage envy behind a mask of other wordliness. Its always about destroying natures best, prompted by the realization that they cannot arrive in this category honorably, abiding natural law. If anything,..an honorable, reasonable solution would be to line up black women of whatever nation, that desired to adopt and give these women some funds to do so&hellip;as no matter,&hellip;money will be spent, so at least this way.. the lines of nature are respected.</p>

<p>whenever the state raids one of these sleezy puppy mills here in missouri, the media runs stories for days showing these sick and malnourished dogs. people line up to adopt these pitiful animals. is this any different?</p>
<p>Yes, there is a big difference. Those four legged animals from the puppy mills will grow up to be loving, faithful, and domestic companions for the people who adopt them. When those bipeds from Haiti grow up, that&rsquo;s different story.</p>

<p>&#8220;These people are foolish, disgusting, and deeply stupid. Foolish for making a life-changing decision on the basis of TV pictures. Disgusting for choosing a Black foreigner when there are White kids in their own state who need homes. Deeply stupid for bringing Haitian chaos into their lives. It&rsquo;s pure moral posturing, vanity wearing a mask of charity. Nobody notices you when you go out in public with your White adopted kid, but if you&rsquo;ve got a Black pet, everyone can see that you&rsquo;re one of those saintly liberals. It&rsquo;s even better than an Obama sticker on your car for displaying your moral virtue, because it&rsquo;s much more exclusive. Anyone can get a sticker for a few bucks, but there are only 380,000 lucky and virtuous White Americans who will have the opportunity to get their own Haitian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well stated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to add that such acts inflate the condescending racism of these adopters amidst all of those acts of &#8220;charity&#8221;. There&rsquo;s nothing better for such people than boosting their grandiose sense of &#8220;superiority&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I propose that instead of White Americans adopting Haitians, Haitians should be encouraged to adopt American Blacks.  We can provide some financial incentives and free shipping.  Heck, we can even throw in a few thousand Mexicans as part of the deal.  It would be a win-win for all concerned.  Haiti gets to replace the folks it lost, and we get to sleep a little better at night. </p>

		<p>It never ceases to amaze me why whites will go all over the world to adopt a child but will ignore the children who have been cleared for adoption and currently living in foster care. These children need homes too. I personally get disgusted when I see an Asian, probably Chinese child with white adoptive families. This child would be a lot happier with a Chinese family. In fact, the Chinese government has been giving overseas Chinese first preference in adopting children. This also has been true for adoptions from India. Those who were born in India or have parents that were born in India, get first preference in adopting Indian children. I personally believe that Black children belong with Black families. Can you imagine these white mothers having to do their Haitian childs hair and not have a clue how to do it?</p>
