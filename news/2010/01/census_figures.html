<p>{snip} .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. according to the report from American Community Survey data, which was released Wednesday {snip} Africa now accounts for one in three foreign-born blacks in this country, another modern record.</p>
<p>{snip} The foreign born are more likely to list their nation of origin when identifying race or ethnicity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} As a result of intermarriage with native-born Americans, a growing number of American children  &mdash;  now more than one in four under the age of 6  &mdash;  are being raised by at least one foreign-born parent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the nation&rsquo;s 37.3 million blacks, more than 8 percent are now foreign born, compared with 1 percent in 1960. Of those, more than half came from the Caribbean. Some 34 percent emigrated from Africa, compared with 1 percent in 1960.</p>
<p>{snip} .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in 2008, the number of African-born Americans topped one million for the first time.</p>
<p>Seventy-eight percent of native-born Americans reported their race as white, followed by 13 percent who said they were black. Among the foreign born, 46 percent identified themselves as white and 23 percent as Asian.</p>

		<p>Sorry, my previous post contained a link to a very abreviated version from the Atlantic City Press of the story of the Muslim in Buffalo who beheaded his wife.<br>
The following link is right from Buffalo News and contains the irony vis a vis the mission of the TV station that the &#8220;accused&#8221; and his wife started. I hope that you&rsquo;ll post this correction.</p>
<p>This is a short URL.</p>

<p>If those Census numbers are to be believed, which they&rsquo;re not, we would have 2.9 million less blacks in this country if it weren&rsquo;t for immigration.  I pay very close attention to Census Bureau statistics and I know for a fact the number of blacks in this country was listed as over 40 million on their website last year.  Are we to believe the black population is shrinking?  I wonder how many blacks really are in this country.  Fifty million, sixty million, maybe?</p>
<p>&#8220;Seventy-eight percent of native-born Americans reported their race as white, followed by 13 percent who said they were black. Among the foreign born, 46 percent identified themselves as white and 23 percent as Asian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost have of the foreign born are White?  What rubbish.  In 2008 the the top ten sources of legal immigration into this country have been Mexico, India, China, Phillipines, Vietnam, Dominican Republic, Pakistan, Haiti, South Korea and El Salvador.   </p>

		<p>It is indeed interesting, is it not, that when African countries were under European colonial rule, very few Africans sought to relocate outside the continent. Africa has long since been &#8220;liberated&#8221; of colonialism, and yet we are witnessing an unprecedented rise in African immigration to the United States. </p>

		<p><i>an unprecedented rise in African immigration to the United States.</i><br>
when a hostile elite offers them welfare, scholarship money, housing, and a country where they can play the race card to their heart&rsquo;s content, what do you expect?</p>
