<h1>Civil Rights Hero Caught in Corruption Probe to Begin Serving Sentence</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Wayne Drash, CNN, Jan. 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Bobby DeLaughter  &mdash;  the prosecutor who secured the conviction in the infamous Medgar Evers Mississippi murder case  &mdash;  is himself now headed to prison.</p>
<p>It was DeLaughter&rsquo;s dogged 1994 prosecution and the subsequent conviction of Ku Klux Klan member Byron De La Beckwith that helped trigger the reopening of dozens of civil rights cold cases.</p>
<p>DeLaughter became an instant hero of the civil rights movement. Alec Baldwin portrayed him in the 1996 movie, &#8220;Ghosts of Mississippi,&#8221; and his closing statement was once dubbed one of the greatest closing arguments in modern law.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it ever too late to do the right thing?&#8221; DeLaughter told the jury of eight blacks and four whites. &#8220;For the sake of justice and the hope of us as a civilized society, I sincerely hope and pray that it&rsquo;s not.&#8221;</p>
<p>DeLaughter would go on to become a state judge in 2002. His years in the robe came to an end in 2009, when DeLaughter pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for lying to an FBI agent in a far-reaching corruption probe that has rocked Mississippi&rsquo;s judicial system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>DeLaughter is to begin serving his 18-month prison sentence today at a facility in Kentucky.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The story of DeLaughter going from civil rights hero to convicted felon is complicated, involving years of contentious litigation in his courtroom.</p>
<p>At the heart of the case is Dickie Scruggs, a high-powered lawyer who made tens of millions of dollars in tobacco and asbestos litigation. Scruggs is the brother-in-law of former Sen. Trent Lott and is now serving seven years in prison for trying to influence Mississippi judges, including DeLaughter.</p>
<p>According to prosecutors, Scruggs wanted to get to DeLaughter through his mentor, Peters, to try to influence DeLaughter&rsquo;s ruling in a high stakes case, potentially worth $15 million. Peters received $1 million in illicit payments as compensation for his actions, prosecutors say. Peters was granted immunity in exchange for his cooperation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mississippi would like to shake its image of being tied to civil rights crimes and the good ole boy network, and we see these two things overlap here,&#8221; Steffey said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s enormously unfortunate for a person like Judge DeLaughter who, at the very least, accomplished heroic things with bringing Byron De La Beckwith to justice. And it&rsquo;s tragic for the people of Mississippi  &mdash;  that the end story here is that he is a corrupt judge in prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>DeLaughter has denied taking any money in the case or that he was improperly influenced. In his guilty plea, he admits to only obstruction of justice; the more serious charges of involvement in a bribery scheme and mail fraud conspiracy were dismissed as part of the deal.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, he is a tragic figure because he had a good career and he threw it away,&#8221; said attorney Bill Kirksey. &#8220;He became an embarrassment to the legal community, to the judicial community and, I would hope, to himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Morris Dees, the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, represented Myrlie Evers, the widow of Medgar Evers  &mdash;  the NAACP leader who was gunned down in his driveway on June 12, 1963.</p>
<p>He says only one man had the guts to seek prosecution in the case when two previous trials years before ended without convictions.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Bobby DeLaughter hadn&rsquo;t been around, it would never have happened. I can guarantee you that,&#8221; Dees said. &#8220;It was the first modern-day prosecution of one of these old civil rights-era murders, and it resulted in the prosecution and convictions of a large number later.&#8221;</p>
<p>DeLaughter&rsquo;s bravery in seeking justice in the Evers case, Dees said, makes it tough to swallow his more recent failings as a judge. &#8220;Certainly, when a judge is put in prison and pleads guilty,&#8221; Dees said, &#8220;it certainly tarnishes his legal and judicial reputation.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wonder who&rsquo;s going to portray him as an inmate in the next movie?</p>
<p>&#8220;DeLaughter is to begin serving his 18-month prison sentence today at a facility in Kentucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those places are nowhere near the chaotic conditions of regular prisons, but they&rsquo;re not country clubs either.  There are still several blacks in the minimum security institutes, so there&rsquo;s a good chance he will get to see the fruits of his labor up close and personal and wind up as some black&rsquo;s &#8216;ho.</p>
<p>I wonder if the wedding ceremonies will take place in the chapel or the shower?</p>

		<p>This is the type of traitorous white I despise the most.  He didn&rsquo;t do it for justice.  He did it as a vehicle to get to the top - fast - like all good liberals do.  &#8220;Right or wrong&#8221; is never part of their equation.  You notice how &#8220;they&#8221; say his closing argument was the greatest?  Right.  He didn&rsquo;t have to say one word and he would have gotten the same praise.  He&rsquo;s of the same caliber as that *%*((%! in North Carolina, Mike Nifong!  Ugh, my stomach is churning&hellip;.</p>
<p>I hope he enjoys his showers!<br>

		<p>Perhaps the crime should be &#8220;knowingly lying to a FBI agent while knowing that it is likely to obstruct justice&#8221; and have the penalty dependent on How much just you believed it would obstruct&#8221;</p>

		<p>Yes Bobby DeLaughter prosecuted De La Beckwith and got a conviction, but it was by perjuring himself and hiding key witnesses. DeLaughter, Ed Peters, and their investigator all lied under oath when asked if they knew the whereabouts of a key witness, the carhop who saw the gunman that killed Evers, and if they had been in contact with her. All three denied contact and knowledge of her whereabouts. De La&rsquo;s lawyer then dropped a bomb by disclosing that he had been contacted by the ex carhop and she was wondering why she had not been contacted by the defense. She stated that she had been in contact with DeLaughter/Peters on numerous occasions. The reason they didn&rsquo;t want her to testify is that she stated that the person that got out of the car that looked like Mr. Beckwith&rsquo;s was tall, young and handsome, three traits that De La Beckwith did not possess in 1963. They both should have been arrested then and there for perjury, the Judge never blinked an eye and went on as if nothing had happened. <br>
Also after the jury had been out for awhile the judge called them back in, one white lady was in tears an very upset, she had voted not guilty and was set upon by the blacks on the jury.<br>
The whole trial was a sham and the only object was to advance the career of Bobby DeLaughter on the back of an old man who loved his country and his people. DeLaughter didn&rsquo;t make the closing statement that was supposed to be so great, it was that devil Ed Peters who made the statement.<br>
 I only regret that DeLaughter didn&rsquo;t receive life and have to serve it in Parchman Penitentiary where he stuck Mr. Beckwith after his conviction. <br>
I knew Mr. Beckwith personally from the time I was five years old and everyone from our hometown knows it wasn&rsquo;t he who killed Evers no more than Oswald killed Kennedy or James Earl Ray Killed Martin Luther King. <br>
DeLaughter in prison just proves that sooner or later what goes around comes around, he got what was coming to him.</p>

		<p>As an investigative reporter, I covered that Beckwith trial in Jackson in 1994 and can report here that it was a sham in which defense witnesses were shut out, exculpatory evidence denied and even the judge appeared to be part of the prosecution.<br>
Yes, the case was initiated by DeLaughter   &mdash;   only because his father-in-law happened to have the alleged murder weapon at home in his closet   &mdash;   but contrary to the movie&rsquo;s fiction, DeLaughter was clumsy and incompetent as a prosecutor and DID NOT even make the closing statement, as portrayed by Baldwin. Agreed, the closing was the best I remember ever hearing   &mdash;   and I have covered a lot of trials   &mdash;   but it was done by District Attorney Ed Peters, not his assistant Bobby DeLaughter, who they feared was about to blow the case.</p>

		<p>I knew it, I KNEW IT when that sham trial concluded that this judge was a liar.  GLad to see that now he&rsquo;ll get to rub, um, shoulders with some of his people.</p>
<p>GetBackJack said it best: DeLaughter is the kind of white person (I WON&rsquo;T call him a man) we on AR despise the most. </p>

		<p>Hooray!  DeLaughter&rsquo;s willingness to lie in De La Beckwith&rsquo;s trial finally caught up with him.  My wife always says that it is habits that will save you or sink you.  Anyone who doubts her is free to ask O.J. Simpson.<br>

		<p>Notice that last weasel quote from Dees.  Had it been one of De La&rsquo;s defense attorneys going to Club Fed for obstruction, then the SPLC would have a million money beg letters circulating right now.</p>
<p>It is my understanding that Dees wasn&rsquo;t as involved with the 1990s trial of De La as much as he would like to think.</p>
<p>4 and 5:  I know that within the last year of his admin, Kirk Fordice was thinking about pardoning De La, and now your posts tell me that he would have been on solid ground doing so.  Ironically, Fordice appointed DeLaughter as a state judge.  Perhaps that part was greasing the skids for a pardon.</p>

		<p>As usual, the cart was put before the horse. The white liberal prosecuter doing what ever it takes to obtain the conviction in order to right the so called wrongs of the past. You did what you did, and now you must pay the price. You bad mouth us as die hard unreconstructe  southerners then you break the law to prove your point.

		<p>BdlB fans take note: He was a two-time loser. His first conviction was for a bomb plot against the B&rsquo;nai B&rsquo;rith, for which he served three years.</p>
