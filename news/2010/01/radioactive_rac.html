<h1>Radioactive Racism at Tennessee Nuclear Waste Processing Company</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sue Sturgis, Institute for Southern Studies, January 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A radioactive waste processing company in Memphis, Tenn. recently agreed to pay $650,000 to settle a race discrimination lawsuit charging it with exposing African-American workers to higher radiation levels than white workers.</p>
<p>The legal action was brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against RACE, which stands for Radiological Assistance, Consulting and Engineering. The company, which processes radioactive waste from hospitals, laboratories and nuclear power plants, was purchased in 2006 by the Swedish waste processor Studsvik, which points out that alleged incidents occurred prior to the sale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the discrimination alleged in this case is unusually extreme because of the physical danger it created for African American employees,&#8221; said EEOC Acting Chair Stuart J. Ishimaru. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the EEOC lawsuit, white managers at RACE subjected African-American employees to excessive radiation exposure  &mdash;  more than their white co-workers. The company allegedly assigned black workers to the shop with radioactive waste while white employees worked elsewhere, and it manipulated the dosimeters that measure radiation exposure to mask the actual levels that black workers received.</p>
<p>Courtney Britton, the lead worker in the shop, and other African-American employees were also subjected to racist comments by white supervisors. The complaint said that Britton&rsquo;s boss referred to him and other black employees with the N-word and other derogatory slurs such as &#8220;boy.&#8221; When he finally complained about the racial harassment, Britton was suspended for 15 days and then laid off.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Besides providing for the payment of $650,000 to 23 African-American employees {snip} Studsvik agreed to adopt an anti-discrimination policy and provide mandatory training about the policy to employees.<br>

		<p>Same old song and dance. In the town where I grew up there was a huge lawsuit a few years ago about a black neighborhood being exposed to undue amounts of dioxin among other pollutants from a local refinery. Never mind that there was a White neighborhood a mile or so away that was just about as close. The blacks got their houses moved to refinery paid land and all of their medical bills paid, even Je$$e Jackson paid a visit so that these poor benighted blacks could have better freeway access. </p>

		<p>This reminds me of what happened in San Francisco.The black &#8220;community&#8221; complained endlessly about the &#8220;dirty&#8221; power plant on Pot-trero Hill, and how much pollutants it put out.It ran on natural gas. The byproducts of burning natural gas are carbon dioxide and water vapor.Two things that all of us expel continously. </p>

		<p>The greater injustice is sending primarily young women including young black women into many of these radiation zones. The world&rsquo;s gone mad.  </p>

		<p>These factories that manufacture/process nuclear fuels employ more women than do most industries. Young black women, especially. It doesn&rsquo;t take experience or training as a machinist to stand all day in a radiation hazard zone. At one time &#8216;feminists&rsquo; must have sued for &#8216;equal&rsquo; treatment. </p>
<p>It boarders on abomination. Certainly it&rsquo;s terribly short sighted and stupid. Another abominable roadstop paved with &#8216;good intentions&rsquo;? </p>

		<p>How appropriate that the lawsuit be against &#8216;RACE&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s finally boiled down to the meat of the issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier and less costly for companies to just pay up in any racially based lawsuit; thus it&rsquo;s set a precedent for a virtually guaranteed win for the blacks.</p>

		<p>This article was published by the &#8220;Institute for Southern Studies&#8221;.  Yeah, that&rsquo;s what they do&hellip;..study the south.  I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re interested in the history and culture of southern whites and their folk heros, like Robert E. Lee.  Right.</p>
<p>They study the south in the same spirit that the CDC studies the small pox virus - as a pathogen to be exterminated.</p>

		<p>In Chapel Hill, North Carolina, an incredibly liberal place, blacks sued for being too close to a landfill or something. In Chapel Hill of all places.</p>
