<h1><a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE60J1H020100120?sp=true">Muslim-Christian Clashes Kill 460 in Nigerian City</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kingsley Igwe and Shuaibu Mohammed, Reuters, January 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The death toll after four days of clashes between Muslim and Christian gangs in the Nigerian city of Jos and nearby communities has topped 460, according to a mosque official and human rights activists.</p>
<p>Six military units and hundreds of police were stationed throughout Plateau state&rsquo;s capital city in central Nigeria to enforce a 24-hour curfew Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The relative calm has allowed mosque officials to retrieve more bodies from neighbourhoods just outside Jos.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found more than 200 bodies gathered at the mosque in Kuru Gada Biu and 22 more at Mai Adiko,&#8221; said Muhammad Tanko Shittu, a senior mosque official organising mass burials, who had earlier estimated the death toll among Muslims at 177.</p>
<p>U.S.-based Human Rights Watch put the number of Christian dead at 65.</p>
<p>Official police figures were significantly lower with 35 people dead, 40 injured and 168 arrested since Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;More troops have come in and the situation is now under control. But there are still many hoodlums dressed in fake police and military outfits causing havoc,&#8221; said Gregory Yenlong, spokesman for the Plateau state government.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This week&rsquo;s violence erupted after an argument between Muslim and Christian neighbors over the rebuilding of homes destroyed in the 2008 clashes.</p>
<p>The fighting is unlikely to have a big impact on sub-Saharan Africa&rsquo;s second biggest economy. Its oil industry is in the south and its banking sector mainly in the commercial capital Lagos.</p>
<p>BURNT BODIES</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s main hospital, Jos University Teaching Hospital, was forced to turn away some patients late Tuesday because doctors were too overwhelmed. &#8220;Ninety percent of the casualties were from gunshot injuries with a few from knives and bows and arrows,&#8221; said Dr. Dabit Joseph, who works at the hospital.</p>
<p>The Red Cross has 40 staff workers and several volunteers at seven centres in Jos to help thousands of displaced residents, an agency spokesman said.</p>
<p>Nigeria has roughly equal numbers of Christians and Muslims, although traditional animist beliefs underpin many people&rsquo;s faiths.</p>

		<p>Haiti, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Somalia, Rwanda, Liberia, Darfur, Sudan, Zimbabwe &hellip;&hellip; on and on. I could include even New Orleans.  I am getting so tired of hearing about the latest African catastrophe (yes, I include N.O. and Haiti, because Africa is wherever you have Blacks).  Africa is just one huge on-going crisis.  And most of these are man-made, while many of the rest could have been avoided  (as with responsible building codes).  These  needless tragedies all get to read the same after awhile. They are not even &#8220;news&#8221; anymore.</p>
<p>And they will all be followed by the same appeals for money   &mdash;   Western money, always more money   &mdash;   with the inevitable posters and magazine pictures of the pathetic, sad-eyed child holding out the empty bowl (for YOU to fill).  It could be a stock photo by now.</p>

		<p>I just discovered a great website regarding how the media is manipulating the image of Muslims and minorities.  Journalists actually have guidlines for pulling the wool over our eyes.</p>

		<p>What always astounds me is the number of casualties in these &#8220;clashes&#8221;, what they call them.</p>
<p>Hundreds sometimes thousands dead in just a few days. Makes the number of lynchings in the U.S. over a FIFTY YEAR PERIOD a trifling by comparison.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&rsquo;t we all just get along?&#8221; NO, we can&rsquo;t!</p>

		<p>Nigeria is a bit like Haiti but with oil. No one seems to be in control, including the black president. Yes, many officials have impressive sounding titles and a government salary which shows how they vote in state governor elections but they don&rsquo;t actually do anything. It&rsquo;s amazing that Nigeria is the worlds 4th largest oil producer but there are constant fuel shortages, power cuts, lousy roads, filthy cities, total corruption and massive unemployment. Virtually no oil money goes to the general population or infrastructure so civil/religious unrest is perennial. They have also flared off ALL their natural gas for the past 70 years without attempting to use any, so next time you hear about the west paying africa compensation to offset your carbon footprint and you are charged extra in fuel taxes for your air trip, just remember to quote that fact because no climate control delegates from africa ever mentions it.<br>

		<p>Ah, the benefits of diversity! Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful that all the Muslims and Christians are living in the same place? I&rsquo;m sure they all are more creative people for it, just as our friends in Europe are(or at least  think up more creative ways to kill each other). </p>

		<p>Sounds like we need to get some Diversity Trainers to Nigeria real quick before it gets really out of hand.  Everybody knows that Diversity is our Strength.  With a just a few effective seminars we will have everybody there holding hands and sing Kum-Bye-Ya.  </p>

		<p>   Nigeria and Ghana have a reputation of being full of con artists and Internet scammers. I can&rsquo;t say that Nigerians are well liked by other Africans. However, I&rsquo;ve know some Nigerian students that I have liked. This Nigerian Christian Muslim conflict may have a tribal element that the controlled media is ignoring.</p>

<p>There is no tribal element here. It&rsquo;s primarily religious conflict. I still blame the British for amalgamating the Muslim North with the more Christian South. Maybe this is why Europe is so open to welcoming radical Arabic Muslims with open arms. That said, Africa&rsquo;s biggest problem is corruption  &mdash;  nothing else.</p>
