	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The initiative  &mdash;  One Chicago, One Nation  &mdash;  is intended to engage Muslims with broader local communities; it was unveiled Thursday night at the Cultural Center. With a Republican investment mogul and a young interfaith superstar among its strategists, the initiative seeks to deflate caricature and bigotry by melding an online film contest with community organizing and grants for multicultural partnerships.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There will be $50,000 in prizes for short videos that tell Chicago stories on diversity. Those will be broadcast on Link TV, with winners announced on June 17 at Millennium Park. {snip} Entries can be submitted to www.linktv.org/onechicago through April 23.</p>

		<p>I bet this &#8220;street level campaign&#8221; won&rsquo;t actually &#8220;campaign&#8221; on any diverse South Side &#8220;streets&#8221; after dark, or even before dark.</p>
<p>I looked at the original article, and the Republican sugar daddy is George F. Russell, Jr.  The reason that is important is that, if my memory serves, Russell likes to dump bags of money on political groups that employ Grover Norquist, and Norquist, like Russell, is an Islamophile.  As a matter of fact, Norquist thought that the Republican Party&rsquo;s next great minority constituency would be Muslims, (because appealing to blacks and Hispanics has worked out so well, or rather, not), and his advice influenced George W. Bush&rsquo;s 2000 Presidential election campaign strategy, especially in Michigan (which worked out so well, or rather, not).  Even after the loss of MI and then 9/11, either Bush nor Norquist disposed of that insanity.</p>
<p>The point being that because Russell/Norquist/Bush wanted Muslim votes, they failed to scrutinize suspicious Muslims at airports.  That allowed 9/11 to happen.  Russell has the blood of some 3,000 people, plus all the Americans sent to Iraq and Afghanistan in reaction, on his hands.</p>

		<p>Has anybody read &#8220;The Politically Incorrect Guide (PIG) to Islam?&#8221;  I have and boy did I learn a lot.  F&rsquo;r instance, the doctrine of &#8220;abrogation:&#8221;  it seems that the PEACEful verses in the Quran are from the Meccan or early period; the more warlike verses are from the later Medina period, and the later verses abrogate (trump!) the earlier ones, according to a number of noted imams.  Hence, &#8220;there is no coercion in Islam to convert&#8221; becomes &#8220;if they won&rsquo;t convert or live as second class citizens, go to war with them and kill them.&#8221;  There&rsquo;s also something called the Hadith, which is a compliation of sayings by the Prophet to witnesses who wrote them down, and this body of material is considered as holy as the Quran.  The Hadith (or Ahadith, the plural) contains much more advocacy of violence and war against unbelievers (us!) than even the Medinan sections of the Quran.  So just what cariacatures and myths of Islam are these people trying to eradicate?  Read the book above and find out the truth!!!</p>

		<p>Muslims engaging with broader local communities won&rsquo;t solve the problem because it IS the problem.</p>
<p>Islam contradicts the values on which this nation was founded, so the only solution is to remove them from our soil before they can further infiltrate, subvert or destroy us. All Muslims, whether born in this country or not, need to be deported and the immigration of Muslims should be permanently forbidden.<br>

		<p>Reply to I like my Muslims Sunni Side Up:</p>
<p>I realize there is the growing threat of incoming Muslims who want to take over America and kill those of us who do not want to convert to Islam.</p>
<p>Should natural-born American citizens who convert to Islam also be deported to Muslim countries, as well as being stripped of their American citizenship?</p>
<p>I am a member of the Freedom from Religion Foundation, myself, so I have no intention of ever converting to any religion.  Even if it means being beheaded by Muslims for refusing to convert to Islam!  </p>
<p>But a growing number of Americans are converting to Islam.  For example, there is a mosque on the Navajo Indian reservation in the southwest United States.  Are American converts to Islam also part the Islamo-facist jihad to tear down America?  This is an important aspect of the Muslim threat to consider.</p>

		<p>They don&rsquo;t mean the bigotry directed against Jews and Christians. That&rsquo;s OK in their minds. They are targeting the Christians and Jews who are afraid that their heads will be separated from their bodies by those wonderful, tolerant, kind, loving &#8220;religion of peace&#8221; people.</p>

		<p>I believe it was HL Mencken who first observed that &#8220;all stereotypes are basically true.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, we have good reason to be wary of Muslims, or blacks, or Hispanics, or any group whose behavioral norms include violence, crime, and overt threats against their neighbors. </p>

		<p>This is so stupid. No one doubts that there are examples from all races, religions, etc. of fine people doing fine things. The thing is that it is the average ability and behaviors that make the overall situation and these averages among the diverse groups differ greatly. </p>
<p>So with all that the news and web sites have shown you about all the threats, distrust, race card playing, shakedowns, violent demonstrations, terrorism, etc., that &#8220;diversity&#8221; brings, who are you going to believe? These proposed videos or you lying eyes? </p>

		<p>Question Diversity- I find your comments about Norquist and Bush well, crazy but probably accurate. I always thought Norquist was a slime because he claimed that trial lawyers and labor unions were &#8220;parasite groups&#8221;. Yeah, unlike his big oil buddies who were charging a king&rsquo;s ransom for gas prices the past 8 years, and another joker in the deck: Phil Gramm, another Texas oil tycoon who claimed that less Wall Street regulation is just what we needed to fix the next Great Depression. Well I got news for ya. I live in Ohio where unemployment is over 10%, and our neighbors to the North, Michigan, is over 18%. But I don&rsquo;t look for handouts like some of the lazy liberals or spoon fed scam artists. Get out and work. </p>

		<p>9 whiteguysrevenge:</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right to catch on to the Norquist/GOP hypocrisy.  Remember this Latin phrase:  Cui bono?  It means &#8220;who benefits?&#8221; (You can ask this question about a lot of Democrats as well.  You&rsquo;ll find Big Oil behind people like Al Gore.  Why do you think Gore&rsquo;s for &#8220;global warming?&#8221;  That&rsquo;s b/c Big Oil is gonna benefit somehow.)   When Norquist and most of the GOP bash &#8220;trial lawyers,&#8221; ask yourself:  Cui bono?  Who benefits from handcuffing the legal profession?  Hint:  The industry that benefits has essentially bought the Republican Party.  Answer:  The insurance industry.  This has always been one of the worst features of the GOP in my lifetime.  Whenever you hear a Republican politician say &#8220;tort reform&#8221; or &#8220;medical malpractice reform,&#8221; there&rsquo;s an insurance company in the background looking to swim in money.  And check out said Republican politician&rsquo;s campaign finance reports   &mdash;   there will be insurance company PAC money listed.  </p>
<p>They are pushing for &#8220;medical malpractice reform&#8221; a lot in the current health care debate, but medical malpractice suits have never been that big of a problem outside a few isolated areas, such as Madison County, Illinois.  Doctors are paying out the rump for malpractice insurance, but it&rsquo;s not lawsuits doing it, it&rsquo;s the diabolical insurance industry.  I wasn&rsquo;t ordinarily a big fan of Missouri&rsquo;s slimy Democrat Governor from 2000-2004, Bob Holden, but one thing he said was right, and he was trying to say it above the insurance company financed Republican noise machine demanding tort reform:  It&rsquo;s the insurance industry lousing around with physicians.  Holden wanted to make all medical malpractice insurance public, i.e. state-run, and in that, I agree.  I think whatever &#8220;medical malpractice reform&#8221; that was enacted needs to be reversed, because of all the H-1B doctors and affirmative action nurses and other health care workers that have entered the system in recent years.  You can bet there will be gross negligence resulting in tragic medical mistakes.  When that happens, they need to be sued for as much as they can.</p>
<p>Not that I&rsquo;m fond of a lot of all lawyers and everything, but given the Hobson&rsquo;s choice, I&rsquo;d rather have lawyers than insurance companies.  Lawyers and lawsuits are the reason why corporations behave to the extent that they do   &mdash;   if not for their lawsuits, and corporations behaving in fear of lawsuits, then government regulations would have to be so many that you&rsquo;d have to cut down every tree in the country to print them.  My beaux ideal of public policy would be in the middle, with a slight preference for the legal profession versus the insurance cabal.  And I&rsquo;m not a lawyer, so everything I say are things that I have learned or discerned just through the powers of observation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Whiteplight a few other posters here are trying to teach us about the lost art of moderation in public affairs when it comes to certain things.  Yes, I do know that a government big enough to do everything for you can also take everything from you, but the converse is also true   &mdash;   a government not strong enough to take anything from you (hint:  Ron Paul) is also not big enough to do anything for you, including some very basic fundamental purposes of government.  The answer is moderation   &mdash;   government should be middle-sized and do a moderate amount of things, social welfare, regulatory powers, and otherwise.  And it should take a moderate amount of taxation from you.  And of course race should come into to   &mdash;   no moderation there   &mdash;   pro-white all the way.<br>
