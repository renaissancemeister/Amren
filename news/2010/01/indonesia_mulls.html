<h1>Indonesia Mulls Tearing Down Obama Statue</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, January 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Indonesian authorities said Monday they are considering a petition to tear down a statue of US President Barack Obama as a boy, only a month after the bronze was unveiled in Jakarta.</p>
<p>The statue of &#8220;Little Barry&#8221;  &mdash;  as Obama was known when he lived in the capital in the late 1960s  &mdash;  stands in central Jakarta&rsquo;s Menteng Park, a short walk from the US president&rsquo;s former elementary school.</p>
<p>Critics say the site should have been used to honour an Indonesian and 55,000 people have joined a page on social networking website Facebook calling for the statue to be removed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve been discussing for the past two weeks what to do with the statue .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whether to take it down, move it elsewhere or retain it. We&rsquo;re finding the best solution,&#8221; Jakarta parks agency official Dwi Bintarto said.</p>
<p>Obama, who was born in Hawaii, lived for four years as a child in Jakarta from 1967 after his divorced mother married an Indonesian.</p>
<p>The bronze was designed by Indonesian artists and depicts the boy Obama dressed in shorts and a T-shirt with a butterfly perched on his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The statue is of Obama as a child, not as the US president. His relatives and friends who erected it said it&rsquo;s meant to motivate children to study hard and dream big,&#8221; Bintarto said.</p>
<p>Members of the &#8220;Take Down the Barack Obama Statue in Menteng Park&#8221; group on Facebook say Obama has done nothing for Indonesia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Barack Obama has yet to make a significant contribution to the Indonesian nation. We could say Obama only ate and s (expletive) in Menteng. He spent his subsequent days living as an American,&#8221; the web page says.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the dignity of a sovereign nation, Barack Obama&rsquo;s monument in Menteng Park must be removed immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>The childhood connection and his knowledge of a few words of Indonesian made Obama popular in the mainly Muslim country of 234 million people.</p>
<p>Obama said in November he would visit Indonesia this year along with First Lady Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha.<br>

<p>Now if we had some pride and dignity as Americans in America.  I respect the Indonesians for not bowing before the false prophet BHO.</p>

		<p>It seems that Indonesia is ahead of the curve in evaluating the accomplishments of BHO.  Perhaps such evaluations are easier if your criteria are simple: &#8220;What has he done for us?&#8221;</p>

		<p>It would be highly symbolic if they tossed the statue into a swamp. After all, that&rsquo;s what Barry&rsquo;s Indonesian classmates did to him on a nearly daily basis. </p>

		<p>All these people going hog-wild naming schools and so on after Obama better think again. Nobody should have anything named after them, or stamps issued, or whatever until after the person is dead. Then you have time to assess what that person&rsquo;s accomplishments are, if any. The statue of &#8220;Little Barry&#8221; should go in the school&rsquo;s playground and leave it at that. </p>

		<p>They should leave the statue up. If I am not mistaken, Indonesia is the country where the young Obama was beaten up and pushed in the water by Indonesian &#8220;youths.&#8221; And yet he never accused them of racism in his autobiography. It takes a heroic level of denial to pull off that omission.</p>

		<p>They want to take it down already?  I never understood why they put it up. BHO was hated when he lived there. Older boys use to beat him up. If he had not been sent to the grandparents, he would have been beaten to death. Indonesians hate black people. Note that BHO has forgotten this and sees only white people as racist.</p>

		<p>Hey why not ship the statue somewhere. </p>
<p>The French sent America the Statue of Liberty.</p>
<p>Lets send the &#8216;Little Barry&rsquo; statue to Haiti!  After all when General Secretary Obama is done with America it will probably resemble Haiti&hellip; after the earth quake!!</p>

Obama hasn&rsquo;t even done anything for the US which elected him. Why should he do something for a country that doesn&rsquo;t pay him big bucks to ruin it?</p>

		<p>Though Keith Olbermann will probably accuse the Indonesians of hating blacks, in reality they&rsquo;re showing national pride and would object to a statue honoring any US president.</p>
<p>I agree 100% w/the poster who said we should wait until public figures are dead before honoring them (or not) so we can assess their legacies more thoughtfully.  </p>

<p>Ah such a man of peace that the world has been waiting for, one day when he grows up little Barry may even win the Noble peace prize like Mother Teresa or the 14TH Dalai Lama&hellip;.&#8221;sorry what&rsquo;s that? Already, Oh OK.&#8221; <br>
Where does he go from here?</p>
<p><i>We could say Obama only ate and s (expletive) in Menteng</i><br>
Sounds like what he&rsquo;s doing the US economy right now.</p>
<p>This story is quite metaphoric really in how quickly this statue has been erected and how quickly there is talk of tearing it down.<br>
More and more people are starting to sober up from their  intoxicated state of self-gratulation to see that the emperor has no clothes and all that they left is a nasty hangover.</p>
