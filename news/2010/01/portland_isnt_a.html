<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Portland is known as the nation&rsquo;s greenest city, the most bicycle-friendly and also the whitest. </p>
<p>With a white population of 74 percent, Portland tops the list as the whitest major city in the country and the fourth whitest among metro areas, according to the U.S. Census. </p>
<p>But a group representing people of color in Multnomah County says Portland isn&rsquo;t nearly as white as we think because government tallies consistently undercount racial minorities. </p>
<p>Though the Census acknowledges a nationwide problem, the group says the discrepancy especially matters here: The sense that Portland has little diversity masks statistical evidence that Asian, black, Latino and Native American residents in one of the touted &#8220;most livable cities&#8221; do worse here than their counterparts across the country. </p>
<p>The population counts are doubly important because they determine, from the federal level to the local, from the public sector to the private, which people get money for services and how much. </p>
<p>The Coalition of Communities of Color has $330,000 in city, county and private grants and is partnering with Portland State University on a three-year project to come up with a more accurate count. </p>
<p>&#8220;We trick ourselves and say, &#8216;We&rsquo;re such a white city, we don&rsquo;t have to talk about race and these issues,&rsquo;&#8221; said Nichole Maher, the coalition&rsquo;s co-chair. &#8220;It allows us to keep acting like everyone is white and no one feels responsibility to challenge the role of race here.&#8221; </p>
<p>The coalition was born eight years ago when groups representing the African American, African immigrant, Latino, Slavik, Asian and Native American communities realized they could better fight their battles together. Often when asking for help to specifically address communities of color, they said, they were told their numbers were too small. </p>
<p>According to the most recent Census data, people of color account for 28 percent of Multnomah County&rsquo;s population. </p>
<p>&#8220;We dispute that number and think the populations of communities of color are significantly higher,&#8221; said Ann Curry-Stevens, professor and community-based research expert at Portland State University&rsquo;s School of Social Work who is working on the project. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>People of color go uncounted for a number of reasons. They tend to be lower income and therefore more transient and hard to find. Some distrust or fear giving information to the government. Others don&rsquo;t receive Census forms in their native language. Some simply live off the grid  &mdash;  they may be new immigrants or homeless  &mdash;  and never come in contact with government agencies. </p>
<p>George Hough, director of the Population Research Center at Portland State, gives the example of how estimates of black men in Portland ballooned between the 1990 and 2000 Census. </p>
<p>&#8220;Either a whole lot of black males moved to Oregon in that time, which we don&rsquo;t believe to be true,&#8221; he said, &#8220;or they were better counted or more chose to be counted.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ever changing rules about ethnicity also make it hard to truly measure certain populations, Hough said. </p>
<p>For instance, before 2000, Hispanic was listed as a racial category. Now people must choose whether they are Hispanic or not and then a race. Many Native Americans want to acknowledge their mixed ancestry, but this skews the Census rolls, said Maher, executive director of the Native American Youth and Family Center. </p>

<p>White Americans are losing the country. There will soon be no white majority metropolitan areas in the country. The pro-immigration politicians and business owners are to blame for this.</p>

		<p>Lord, a while back the local paper across the river in Vancouver WA. was lamenting the fact as to how Portland metro area was so un-diverse and what a crime that was. The tone of the article was pretty much IMHO, a collective accusation of racism on the whole. No matter how hard I try to wrack my brain and understand the logic of people who write/say stuff like this I cant understand it.</p>
<p>We have been off the map in Oregon and Portland for years as far as major crime compared to other large cities. There is a reason for that. A lack of diversity. 90+ percent of the shootings that happen in Portland are done by minorities.</p>

<p>Word gets out that there are a lot of naive white females in a certain city and&hellip; suddenly a whole lot of black males move there.  </p>
<p>It makes a lot of us angry that tax dollars support an organization that specifically serves &#8220;people of color&#8221; but any organization that specifically serves whites is branded a &#8220;hate group&#8221;.  I would go door to door asking whites to commit to join a group just for whites - but I already know what the reaction would be.  Still, if any other white person in the Portland area wishes to join me, just email me and we&rsquo;ll do it.</p>

		<p>People of color go uncounted for a number of reasons. They tend to be lower income and therefore more transient (they skip rent) and hard to find (no forwarding address). Some distrust or fear giving information to the government (outstanding warrants). Others don&rsquo;t receive Census forms in their native language (Ebonics). </p>

		<p>As a Portlander I take every opportunity I can here to shout out what a delightfully white city Portland is.  Even if every person in this article is an educated white person working as hard as they can to create diversity where there is none, it&rsquo;s still a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p>What cracks me up is the idea that the black population can&rsquo;t get it together, even in as smooth a ride as Portland.  If you can&rsquo;t make it here you can&rsquo;t make it anywhere.  Why don&rsquo;t you leave the seven block radius you call your North Portland existence and go see some nature?  Go climb a mountain, go pick blueberries.  Go see the ocean.</p>

		<p>It is remarkable that every time a discussion about race and population is underway, it is only moments before the theme veers into the unique &#8220;issues&#8221; and &#8220;needs&#8221; of these &#8220;people of color,&#8221; and into how much more &#8220;funding&#8221; is necessary. Thus we can easily conclude that without all these &#8220;people of color&#8221; we would have far fewer &#8220;issues&#8221; and &#8220;needs&#8221; and of course save a ton of money! Simple&hellip;  </p>

Apparently The Orgonian has a full time paid staffer who refers to herself as the &#8216;papers race blogger&rsquo; - Nokole Hannah-Jones.  It seems like her job is to IMMEDIATELY respond to those posts that go against the leftist multi-cultural dogma; dutifully quoting Noel Ignatiev, Time Wise. et al.</p>

		<p>Glad to hear from the anonymous poster that my beloved Portland is still so very white. I grew up in West Linn and have missed it every day since my father&rsquo;s job took the family here to Houston twenty years ago. At the time, I knew only one Pacific Islander, and my middle school had but three black children out of nearly four hundred students. &#8220;Crime&#8221; as it was consisted of John Bunnell (yes, he was - as was my father - a member of the Multnomah County PD) seizing the occasional home grown marijuana operation. Murder?  On TV. Race riots? In the history books. </p>
<p> I miss it every day, but think that all Oregonians owe it to themselves to spend a few years in a place like Houston. My &#8221; racial awakening&#8221;  might never have occurred had I not moved to Houston&hellip;</p>
<p>I do so very wish to get back to the Pacific NW sometime. The ultimate white flight&hellip;</p>

		<p>This is a growing urban trend.  </p>
<p>As one commenter noted, its all about getting better organized to shake down the white taxpayer and charity contributor.</p>
<p>The truly ambitious among the looters are those who want to run the umbrella organizations.  They want a seat at the table with elected officials, so they can present their &#8216;gimme list&rsquo; at budget time.  They also want the power and prestige to have their asses kissed by others who want to climb the ladder of the hand-out bureaucracy.</p>

		<p>I think the premise is correct, that Portland has more minorities than the official census counts put on.  The reasons given, transiency, language, suspicion, are correct, IMHO.  </p>
<p>This is why I think blacks are more than 13% of the American population.  Think about it   &mdash;   blacks predominate almost every major city in the country.  So few are the big cities where they don&rsquo;t dominate that I can only think of two, Portland here, and Phoenix.  And big cities are where the people are.  So if you have blacks dominating cities, and cities being a big percentage of the population, then why are we to believe they&rsquo;re only 13%?  Add to that the rural Deep South.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it were more like 20%.</p>

		<p>I saw a PBS show a few months ago on Portland and how green it was, how urban friendly it was to farmers. Also on the city trying to control sprawl. The developers were also given their side, and it seemed to show a nice, together city. When &#8216;the poor&rsquo; were brought and how they &#8216;can&rsquo;t afford&rsquo; to live in this city, the one example was a white woman with a mulatto child (no father, of course), and yes, she was skipping on the rent.<br>
Minorities and their fellow travelers are always a drain.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s impossible over 20 million blacks have been missed.  Sixty percent of all blacks live in the south (approx. 24 million).  The rest (16 million) live mainly in large urban areas in the NE and midwest (very few live out west).   </p>

<p>The paper is The Columbian.  For reasons or for a really pathetic explanation of why this is, would take too long.  But it is basically some white people, and especially abreviated feminists who control most of the government and education in Vancouver.  As much as it seems to not make sense, a sort of Christian feminism is what rules Vancouver.  The community college panders to &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; as if it were a religion and teaches it as policy.  But of course, the city cannot see that it is ruining itself.  Vancouver is a smaller, but clearer example of how a town ruins itself with the mismash of leftist policies.  The same paper featured a story  a couple days ago about the arraigment of 18 year old pretty blonde, white girl who committed a fraud by holding a car wash for the victim of her Mexican boyfriend&rsquo;s vehicular manslaugther - a 50 year old and beloved teacher.  She announced the carwash to the victim&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s church and many of the congregation came and had their cars washed.  She then took more than half the proceeds and bailed her boyfriend out of jail.  This is the state of youth in the Northwest.  And it is a result of the combination of naivity, feminism, and a shortcircuting of ethics for the ideal taught to girls like this; that a non-white is so intrinsically good or cool, that everyone will understand why she used some of the money to free him.  Not the remotest notion of reality.  Even her photo, taken in court seemed to show her as an idiot who was just figuring out that she did something illegal.</p>

<p>The only explanation I can offer is that this is a reflection of the truly amateur nature of government in Oregon and Washington.  I have known a great many slavs here and they don&rsquo;t care too much for blacks and hispanics.  In fact, they pretty much keep to themselves.  Can&rsquo;t blame them.  Whites here are pretty poor specimens as well.  Mush for brains.  (Oregon is the meth capital of the U.S. remember).  How this idiot could make a statement as above is explaned in the really vivid imagination of unqualified people who think they can create reality by pronouncing things like this.<br>

<p>There is always a big fight going on in Oregon over taxes.  They are floating a proposition now to tax corporations and individual making over $250,000.00 to pay for services for the poor, schools, etc.  They are trying to create a state&rsquo;s version of Obama&rsquo;s federal revenuing proposal.  That seems completely idiotic to me, since such a state law would invite the wealth and successful to leave the state.  Their ace in the hole is the fact that Oregon IS a really beautiful state.  Between the rednecks who would like to clearcut the entire state and pinkos that would like to give it all away to minorities, the poor land hasn&rsquo;t got much of a future.  The reason so many minorities have flooded in Portland and Oregon in general is a combination of its sleepiness and naivity, as well as a healthy and only slightly less recently gain of liberal whites from the East Coast. The women are really loose too.  Portland has always had a disproportional number of nude dance clubs and porn shops than usual. <br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think of Slavic people as a &#8220;community of color&#8221;, and no one else does either. They are a &#8220;minority&#8221; in the broadest sense of the word, being culturally and linguistically different from native-born whites. However, no one conceives of Russians and Ukrainians, most of whom have typical Northern European looks, as anything other than white.<br>

You&rsquo;ve never been to Oakland, Watts, Compton or any of a  number of other Western cities that most AR readers can name. And personally, since I travel around the world AND ride my motorcycle ALL OVER THE U.S. I too believe the  black population of the U.S. is more like 40+% and all, nothing but trouble and muslims waiting to be converted.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m moving to the southern Washington area (Vancouver or Camus, not sure which) this summer. My wife and I recently had a little girl so we&rsquo;re fleeing LA to a less dangerous area. When I move up I will email you. I would be interested in helping you anyway I can including going door to door.</p>

<p>If blacks were 40% of the population (120 million), then how do you explain that there are just over 600,000 black births (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr57/nvsr57_12.pdf) per year (which would be an extremely low birth rate based on a population of 120 million) in the US?    </p>
<p>By the way, hospitals are required to report all birth numbers, so no conspiracy there.</p>
