<h1>Fourth Malaysian Church Attacked in &#8216;Allah&rsquo; Feud</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AP, January 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A fourth church in Malaysia was hit by firebombs Saturday, stoking concern among Christians as a dispute rages over the use of the word &#8220;Allah&#8221; by non-Muslims.</p>
<p>The latest incident occurred after three other churches were firebombed Friday, just days after a Kuala Lumpur court ruled non-Muslims to use the word &#8220;Allah&#8221; to refer to God in their literature.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Dec. 31 court decision incensed many Muslims, who see it as a threat to their religion. Hateful comments and threats against Christians have been posted widely on the Internet, but this is the first time the controversy has turned destructive.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The court ruling followed a petition by Malaysia&rsquo;s Roman Catholic Church, whose main publication, the Herald, uses the word &#8220;Allah&#8221; in its Malay-language edition. The ruling also applies to the ban&rsquo;s broader applications such as Malay-language Bibles, more than 10,000 copies which were seized last year by authorities because they translated God as Allah.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the government contends that making Allah synonymous with God may confuse Muslims and ultimately mislead to them into converting to Christianity, a punishable offense in Malaysia despite a constitution that guarantees freedom of religion.</p>
<p>It suggests using &#8220;Tuhan,&#8221; but Christians say Tuhan is more like &#8220;Lord,&#8221; and can&rsquo;t replace &#8220;Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p>The debate has split the Muslim community. Hundreds of Muslims held peaceful protests in mosques nationwide Friday but some leading Muslim scholars, activists and opposition politicians have supported the Christians&rsquo; right to call God Allah.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Allah ban is unusual in the Muslim world. The Arabic word is commonly used by Christians to describe God in such countries as Egypt and Syria. The confiscated Bibles came from neighboring Indonesia, an overwhelmingly Muslim country.</p>

		<p>Arab Christians have used Allah in worship from their beginning, centuries before Mohammed. Islam is the thief here! </p>

		<p>Coptic Christians in Egypt use the term &#8216;Allah&rsquo; to refer to the Christian God, too. Oddly enough, the issue of this possible impeity has never been raised in Egypt, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p>Compared to most of the comparable states in the neighborhood, Malaysia is a success story.</p>
<p>Malaysia is a success story, but the cruelty, bigotry and ignorance of Islam is just under the surface.</p>
<p>The Muslim-dominated Government is trying to calm things down and even the supposedly-more-extremist PAS, the main oppositionist party, has condemned attacks on churches.</p>
<p>Apart from anything else, the coalition running the country know that any sort of racial strife might be as bad for business as the tragic events of 1969, when Malays ran amok [a Malay word, by the way] and many Chinese fled the country, taking their capital and their brains with them.</p>
