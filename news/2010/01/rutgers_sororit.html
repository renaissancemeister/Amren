<h1><a href="https://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/01/rutgers_sorority_members_hazin.html">Rutgers Sorority Members Are Accused of Beating Pledges During Hazing</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sue Epstein and Tom Haydon, Star-Ledger (Newark), January 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today, Rutgers police said they had arrested six members of the sorority on charges of aggravated hazing, alleging they repeatedly beat at least three pledges between Jan. 18 and Jan. 25. A university official, vice president of student affairs Greg Blimling, and the pledge who spoke to The Star-Ledger put the number of victims at seven.</p>
<p>The university immediately suspended the Rutgers chapter of Sigma Gamma Rho, as did the sorority&rsquo;s national organization, headquartered in North Carolina.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Authorities said the beatings took place at Rockoff Hall, a student apartment building on George Street, and at private homes in Newark and West Orange. In addition to the paddling, police said, the pledges were in some cases denied food.</p>
<p>The pledge who spoke to The Star-Ledger did so on condition of anonymity, saying she feared retaliation. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The pledge said she was eager to join Sigma Gamma Rho, an African-American sorority founded in 1922, because of its history of community service. On Jan. 18, eight pledges gathered in an apartment in Rockoff Hall, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Then the paddles came out. The pledges, clad in sweat pants, were instructed to wrap blue and gold tape around the wooden paddles, each a foot long and 6 inches wide, she said.</p>
<p>She was struck 19 times that night, she said. Four sorority members delivered the blows, the pledge said, while two others supervised. She said the group was told the beatings would &#8220;humble&#8221; them and would get them to rely upon one another.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end, we were supposed to be helping each other,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>One pledge stopped attending after a few nights, she said. Another began to bleed freely at one point. The pain, she said, grew worse by the day. By Monday, unable even to lie down without pain, she called her cousin and mother and went to the hospital.</p>

		<p>Hazing is a perennial problem in AA fraternities/sororities. Trace it back to slavery: the pressing need of all young AA&rsquo;s to wiggle  out from the bottom of the heap, unto the top. What better way to do that then to whale to tar out of some other human being  &mdash;  it could be some whitey who wanders into the hood, or it could be some &#8220;sister&#8221; in the ole sorority  &mdash;  both are equally satisfying.</p>

		<p>I remember when I was at The University of Tennessee there was a black fraternity that would burn a horseshoe shaped brand onto their pledges. This had to cause great pain. I think the brand was sybolic of Omega but I am not certain.</p>
<p>Anyway this type of self mutilation is evident in black culture everywhere. Just look at the Nubange and the blacks who stretch their necks to unimaginable legnths. Point is it&rsquo;s in the DNA and whitey can preach and teach all he wants but they are gonna do what their gonna do. Then blame whitey for the casualties. </p>

		<p>The MSM in my area failed to mention that the hazings took place in a black sorority. If it had been white girls paddling black girls, it would been the lead story, with the reporters screaming racism at the top of their lungs.</p>

		<p>The problem here is that blacks often mindlessly emulate whites without understanding why whites do what they do.</p>
<p>Of course it must be noted that whites often go too far, but in my experience, blacks aren&rsquo;t simply going too far, they are just proceeding blindly down the same path that they see white people going down without understanding where the path leads.</p>
<p>The point of hazing (and no I&rsquo;m not defending it) is to create a since of shared trauma that helps bond people together.  This is the point of basic training in the military to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Blacks, mindlessly aping whites, aren&rsquo;t as social as whites are to begin with, so they don&rsquo;t get the social aspect of what we do.  Beyond that, all they see is the violence, and being more violent than whites, they take to the hazing with greater enthusiasm.</p>

		<p>This is the perfect example, of you can teach any one, or any animal, all sorts of things, but you can&rsquo;t make them intelligent, only learned. This makes one wonder what other unrevealed atrocities may have happened, at the hands of these semi intelligent perps. </p>

		<p>Fraternities and sororities are usually portrayed in the mainstream media as enclaves of <i>white privilege</i> run amok.</p>
<p>In this case, it is fair to see that an African American sorority is subject to the same pitfalls.  Hazing isn&rsquo;t just a white thing.</p>

		<p>This made my local paper all the way out here on the West Coast.</p>
<p>Race was omitted, of course, giving the impression that the sorority is White.  </p>
<p>You can bet if it were a White sorority or fraternity, the story would not have been buried on the back pages, but rather a front page feature with the words &#8216;White&rsquo; (non-capitalized), &#8216;privilege&rsquo; and &#8216;wealthy&rsquo;  prominently mentioned in the first paragraph.</p>
<p>On another note:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Los Angeles Times print edition will shrink again Monday, victim of a severe recession and changing readership habits. </p>
<p>Like all newspapers, the print edition&rsquo;s readership has declined more than 30 percent in the Internet era. A stand-alone daily California-local news section has already evaporated, as have the book review, Sunday opinion section, real estate section, and other longstanding features&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t be linked with the disappearance of White California, could it  &mdash;  or the fact that the LA Times continues to debase and insult those few of us Whites who are left? </p>
<p>There will soon be no daily newspapers left in S. Cal because the replacement population can neither read nor write.</p>

		<p>Somehow, somewhere, there&rsquo;s a White that will be blamed.</p>

		<p>I know a lot about fraternity and sorority hazing because I went to a school with a huge Greek scene.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just another example of the same: inferiority complex, crabs in a barrel syndrome, claw each other down to make themselves feel good.  Black people get away with it everyday, all over the country.  The more aggressive ones are the most powerful in the community because:</p>
<p>1. Everyone else is afraid of them<br>
2. It&rsquo;s seen as a personal issue (in the black community, only political issues matter, namely racism).<br>
3. It&rsquo;s seen as trivial (in the face of racism everything else becomes trivial).</p>
