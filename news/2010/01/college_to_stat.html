<h1>College to State Rep: Give Us Our $25,000 Statue Back</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Sneed, Chicago Sun-Times, January 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Is state Rep. Monique Davis (D-Chicago) one brick short of a load? Sneed has learned Davis, who already is in hot water for a $500,000 bill allegedly owed to the Chicago Board of Education, is now refusing to return a $25,000 sculpture of an African slave, which is owned by Chicago State University!</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sneed is told the life-sized bronze by Colorado-based sculptor David Parvin was purchased five years ago using a segment of state funds appropriated for a student financial aid center at CSU.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* The backshot: The sculpture originally occupied several campus sites before it disappeared.</p>
<p>* The buckshot: It was during a recent audit of the school, which was fiscally mismanaged for years, that the statue was discovered missing.</p>
<p>* The upshot: New CSU President Wayne Watson, who is trying to install better top-to-bottom management, procurement and educational standards, insisted on the statue being returned because it is school property.</p>
<p>* The errant shot: How did the sculpture, titled &#8220;Defiance,&#8221; wind up in Davis&rsquo; possession? Who knows? But Davis, a graduate of CSU, did admit she had the statue when CSU contacted her, according to a school source.</p>
<p>Sneed is told CSU police visited Davis&rsquo; office several times to retrieve the 400-pound sculpture  &mdash;  only to be turned away.</p>
<p>* The slingshot: When Sneed contacted Davis Thursday and asked if she had an explanation for how the statue wound up in her office, she retorted: &#8220;Nope, don&rsquo;t have any explanation. I&rsquo;ve got a call on the other line. Can I call you back?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We showed her the documents proving it was Chicago State&rsquo;s property. But she just refused to let us have the statue.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* The ultimate slap: &#8220;She called last Tuesday [Jan. 12] at 4 p.m. and said we could come pick up the statue. I asked if I could come the next day because I needed the movers  &mdash;  and she said &#8216;fine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she called the president&rsquo;s office about two hours later and changed her mind and said we can&rsquo;t pick up the statue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* The final shot: Parvin, who created 21 &#8220;Defiance&#8221; statues, says: &#8220;Black people, especially black women, love this piece. I&rsquo;ve had women cry over this piece. They are usually surprised when they find out I&rsquo;m not black.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is a blatant example of the overwhelming hubris of the elite of this crumbling empire, especially among the nouveau third-world office-holders.<br>
It&rsquo;s really the final circle of the bowl for the whole lousy structure.<br>
Such arrogance, such grasping, venal rapaciousness.<br>
It would be a miracle if anyone could recognize the USA in 30 years.</p>

		<p>Why isn&rsquo;t she in jail?</p>
<p>I once worked for a black woman that lost her job in DC when Clinton left office.  She was given a nice management job in Florida State Gov&rsquo;t.  When she arrived she brought her own office furniture.  We had to move it in for her and I remember her telling us to be careful because it cost over $20,000. We are talking one pair of shelves, a desk, a credenza and a chair. BTW, all bought on a federal grant that somehow now belonged to this woman.</p>
<p>Can you just imagine the thievery going on in DC now.</p>

		<p>I am supposing that this is supposed to be some sort of comment on the white master wanting this black slave and she&rsquo;s refusing. If this ever did happen which I am certain it did on rare occasions it hasn&rsquo;t happened in over 100 years. What is far more prevalent is the rape and abuse of white women by black men all over the world. Can anyone say Shannon Christian. </p>

		<p>Won&rsquo;t give it back? Why are they asking her? They should just go and take it back. It doesn&rsquo;t belong to her. Blacks know a secret about liberals of which everyone should be aware. Just tell them &#8220;No&#8221; and mean it. Then watch as they wet themselves and blubber about what&rsquo;s fair.</p>

		<p>That statue does appear to be a pretty good work of art.</p>
<p>Question! Was it intended to be dressed or is that someone having a notion to show the statue in a more respectful manner.?</p>
<p>Over a century ago there was a statue of a young naked Greek woman in chains I believe, highlighting the Turkish slave trade.</p>
<p>The statue toured the U.S. and some folks wanted to display the statue dressed, but the sculpture said NO, so the statue toward naked, as was intended.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am supposing that this is supposed to be some sort of comment on the white master wanting this black slave and she&rsquo;s refusing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chicago State is an almost totally all-black school that was set up for blacks primarily. Supposed to provide a cadre of trained blacks to teach in the Chi schools, but never seems to provide that cadre. The schools validation is in trouble too? A mess!</p>

		<p>I think it is amusing that the statue itself hasn&rsquo;t come under criticism by feminists and others for indecency via upper body nudity.  It&rsquo;s not as if it is being displayed in an art gallery.</p>

		<p>I am quite surprised that police were willing to ASK PERMISSION to go pick up evidence in a case of grand theft.  A white male in possession of $25,000 worth of stolen property would have been arrested immediately.  </p>

		<p>Tim Kennerly(#3), this is a bit off-topic, but it is mostly a myth that America&rsquo;s part-white blacks are descended from Plantation Owners who &#8216;bred&rsquo; their slave women.</p>
<p>Whites were being thrown off their commonly-held lands in Scotland and Ireland, and sent, basically as slaves, to the New World.  The men frequently &#8220;died of exertion&#8221; (were worked to death in the fields), leaving women who could be bred to black males (who did not die, as readily, in the horrific heat of the American South).  The resulting hybrids, it was hoped, would be more docile and intelligent than Africans, yet possess the great physical strength and heat-resistance of Blacks.  Today, of course, we can see about how well that breeding program worked.</p>
<p>I can only imagine how horrible it must have been for those poor women.  Simply in a gynecological sense, it must have been pure torture.  And what must it have been like, to raise black children?  And to have a black &#8216;husband&rsquo;?   </p>
<p>The black women who actually were impregnated by white plantation owners usually had the status of mistresses: many being regarded almost as wives.  Their progeny became freemen of color&hellip;many owning plantations and slaves.  But this sort of thing happened in the earliest days of colonization (mostly in Louisiana): before so many white slave women were available to plantation owners.</p>

Huh?   I just don&rsquo;t get this!   How do you &#8220;turn the police away&#8221; and refuse to give back property that is not yours?   </p>
<p>So now compliance with the law is voluntary?  At least if you&rsquo;re black.</p>
