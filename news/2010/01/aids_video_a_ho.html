<h1>AIDS Video a Hoax, Woman Admits</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Oralandar Brand-Williams, Detroit News, January 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The woman who caused a stir on the Internet this week with a video in which she says she has infected more than 500 people with HIV told The Detroit News today that she does not have the virus.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t have AIDS,&#8221; Jackie Braxton, 23, said in an interview. &#8220;I made the tape because I wanted to raise awareness about AIDS.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police picked up Braxton at a college she attends downtown and immediately took her to the city&rsquo;s health department to be tested for the virus that causes AIDS. The test results are confidential, but Braxton said she does not have HIV.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Braxton said she feels &#8220;bad&#8221; about making the video that has spread panic among Metro Detroiters and others around the country. But, she said she felt her tape served its purpose when she went to the city&rsquo;s health department this morning and saw people waiting to get tested for AIDS.</p>
<p>Braxton, who uses the stage name &#8220;Fame&#8221; and has a 5-year-old daughter, admitted she made the videotape to market her own porn site, which she says she operates with her husband. Braxton&rsquo;s video on the Mediatakeout.com site had recorded more than 430,000 hits by Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Braxton also told The Detroit News she makes porn videos with her husband.</p>

		<p>Couldn&rsquo;t she have washed her neck before the photo was taken.  Really, any man who goes to bed with such a trollope deserves all he gets.  Let us hope she is quickly consigned to the trash can of history.</p>

		<p>According to HER she doesn&rsquo;t have AIDS. I wouldn&rsquo;t trust her any farther than I could throw her.</p>

		<p>Sorry, Mr. Deller - that is not dirt on her neck, but a tattoo.  Almost as grotesque is the notion that some people would actually pay to watch video of this woman in action.  Ick.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Why no Doctor, there&rsquo;s no possible way I have AIDS,&hellip; I mean, sure, there was this black woman who slept with hundreds of men, had some sort of trashy tattoo on her neck, makes porn videos, and once posted a video saying she did have AIDS&hellip;. but then she said she doesn&rsquo;t have AIDS&hellip; a woman like that wouldn&rsquo;t lie so I had sex with her&hellip;. I can&rsquo;t possibly have AIDS&hellip; you&rsquo;re test must be wrong&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

<p>What do you mean exactly?  Running an adult entertainment website or telling everyone that she is HIV positive?  </p>
<p>Well, I have never personally met anyone who publicly and proudly stated that he or she is HIV +.  I am sure I have had chances to meet several HIV positive people in my life, but they never ever stated it publicly.  and I have never personally met anyone who built and ran an adult entertainment website.  </p>
<p>Maybe I have not lived long enough or met enough people yet!</p>
<p>Maybe some blacks like to do this?  Create a hoax (I agree HIV-related hoaxes are not a tiny bit funny) and scare everyone?  </p>
