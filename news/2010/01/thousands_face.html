			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robin McKie, Guardian (London), January 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Health campaigners say the traditional manhood ritual, which carries HIV risks, should be replaced by operations in hospital</p>
<p>An edict by the king of the Zulus to bring back circumcision for thousands of teenage boys is causing alarm in South Africa, amid record numbers of deaths from the traditional manhood ritual.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, at a meeting called in Durban by the government of KwaZulu-Natal, traditional leaders in the province will outline how they wish to implement King Goodwill Zwelithini&rsquo;s decision to reintroduce circumcision 200 years after it was scrapped by King Shaka. But health officials working with South Africa&rsquo;s second largest tribe, the Xhosa  &mdash;  who never gave up the practice  &mdash;  say the move could put thousands of lives at risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have had a disastrous year, with 80 deaths, including two suicides,&#8221; said Sizwe Kupela, a Xhosa who is health spokesman for the Eastern Cape. Each year, 50,000 Xhosa boys descend on the vast province to undergo the secretive ritual  &mdash;  including circumcision by a &#8220;traditional surgeon&#8221; and one month&rsquo;s seclusion in nakedness. &#8220;We see horrific cases of rotting penises, septicaemia and inadvertent castrations,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Others die from dehydration and hypothermia. HIV is spread because the same knife is used on large groups of boys. My personal view is that if the Zulus go back to circumcision, they must do it the western way, in hospital.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last Saturday, wrapped in a blanket, 19-year-old Andile Ngcolomba ended his month in seclusion by walking off the aloe-covered slopes of Peddie into his mother&rsquo;s impoverished village in Qamini Location.</p>
<p>He remembered very little about the visit he received in his mountain shelter on 7 December from the traditional surgeon: &#8220;He arrives covered in clay and animal pelts. He is so ugly you don&rsquo;t want to look at him. I never even saw the knife. You just black out. When you wake up, it is done, and there is some powder there to help the healing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not sleep for seven nights for the pain. To help the pain and healing, they gave me dagga [marijuana] to smoke and I was not allowed to drink water or have salt in my food for a week after the cutting.&#8221;</p>
<p>During his time &#8220;on the mountain&#8221;, Ngcolomba and other initiates in adjacent shelters received visits every other day from an ikangata (teacher), Mazinyanwana Mkhongi. The teacher, in his 70s, said: &#8220;My role is to check that the wound is healing and to explain the duties and responsibilities of a man. He must be able to survive in the wild, fight, but also resolve conflicts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ngcolomba, who lives with his mother and elder sister in the Cape township of Khayelitsha, had gained a warrior name, Nasayi, and been briefed by his teacher on the terrible dangers of the witches of Peddie, said to be among the most fearsome anywhere.</p>
<p>After enduring the process, he was more convinced than ever of its virtues: &#8220;To us Xhosas, circumcision is what makes you a man. All my friends are doing it. Without it you are inkwenkwe  &mdash;  a boy  &mdash;  and you are not allowed to mix with men. Hospital circumcision does not count. You are not a man unless you have survived what I went through. No man can be a leader without it. To me, now, President Jacob Zuma is a boy because he is an uncircumcised Zulu.&#8221;</p>
<p>Former presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki and Archbishop Desmond Tutu are all circumcised Xhosas. Whenever prominent South African figures misbehave, Xhosa title-tattle centres on whether they have been circumcised.</p>
<p>Xhosas frequently denigrate Julius Malema  &mdash;  the outspoken leader of the African National Congress Youth League  &mdash;  because he is an uncircumcised Zulu. In 2008, ANC politician Fikile Mbalula succumbed to peer pressure and, aged 37, entered an initiation school. He later became deputy minister of police.</p>
<p>King Zwelithini claims to be reintroducing circumcision for Zulu boys because there is evidence that the practice sharply reduces HIV transmission. However, with a Zulu president in power, it is likely that the king is equally motivated by a desire to bolster his nation.</p>
<p>Critics of initiation say traditional leaders have failed to update their teachings from the times when the ritual was put in place to select and grade warriors. Despite undergoing government training courses, teachers largely do not address burning South African concerns such as HIV prevention or sexual violence.</p>
<p>The tradition also places a tremendous financial burden on poor families. Goats, blankets and bottles of Viceroy brandy and Smirnoff vodka must be bought. After initiation, a young man must be bought a suit and cap and must throw away his entire wardrobe, including underwear, shoes, school uniform and school bag from his boyhood. Even his mobile phone must go.</p>
<p>During Ngcolomba&rsquo;s seclusion, he was not allowed to see women. His aunt, Nobhukulu, cooked him two meals a day on her hearth and they were taken to him by local boys. Only on emerging from seclusion were women&rsquo;s concerns briefly addressed. Ngcolomba sat in a hut to which his aunts were invited, to present him with gifts and impart views such as &#8220;please do not spend all your time in the shebeen [illicit beer hall]&#8221;.</p>
<p>Aids campaigner Vuyiseka Dubula, secretary general of the Treatment Action Campaign, is concerned that the Zulu king&rsquo;s decision to reintroduce circumcision could put thousands more lives in danger. But she said it was not too late for King Zwelithini to use his decree to mark a revolutionary step forward for both Zulu and Xhosa men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most new incidences of HIV are among women,&#8221; said Dubula, secretary general of the Treatment Action _Campaign. &#8220;Initiation should be about education, including respecting women. I am a Xhosa woman and I know the initiates are taught how to use their power, not how to control it. If this could be changed, while not alienating the traditional leaders, we could see a new generation of men emerge, circumcised and more responsible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sizwe Kupela was less optimistic. &#8220;I have a two-year-old son and I will never allow him to go through what I endured,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am talking to his mother about a hospital circumcision now. My personal view is that the king needs to order Zulu infants to be circumcised under sterile conditions. If the king wants to reduce HIV, it is no good waiting until boys are 18 and already sexually active.&#8221;</p>
<p>A member of the KwaZulu-Natal health department, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the department hoped to convince Zulu traditional leaders of the virtues of medical circumcision over the Xhosa approach.</p>
<p><b>Circumcision and health</b></p>
<p>A key factor in the decision by King Goodwill Zwelithini to bring back circumcision has been the disproportionate impact of HIV on the Zulu people. &#8220;Bacteria can linger under the foreskin and the resulting infections can make glands more susceptible to the transmission of HIV,&#8221; says Tim Oliver, an emeritus professor at Queen Mary University, London. &#8220;Statistics indicate that circumcision has helped to halt the spread of HIV in southern Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other health benefits linked to circumcision include reduced rates for penile, cervical and possibly prostate cancer. In people of Jewish and Arab origin, who traditionally circumcise their boys and young men, rates of the first two diseases are generally very low.</p>
<p>However, the connection between circumcision and disease prevention is not straightforward. &#8220;Studies that have compared disease rates in circumcised and uncircumcised men have not fully teased out the possible roles of other variables,&#8221; adds Oliver. &#8220;Instead of circumcising, it may be just as effective to provide good sexual education and make sure fresh water is available to communities so good hygiene can be practised.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly the risks of circumcision as practised by people such as the Xhosa are substantial and include the danger of developing septicaemia and other infections. In his autobiography, Nelson Mandela says his circumcision, part of his coming-of-age ceremony, left him feeling &#8220;as if fire was shooting&#8221; through his veins. &#8220;Today with modern local anaesthetic this need not be the case,&#8221; says Oliver. &#8220;It worries me that the Zulu king intends this to be a test of courage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus the question facing Africa is whether more circumcision is needed, or whether the same investment  &mdash;  spent on improving access to running water and on education at puberty about foreskin and general sexual hygiene  &mdash;  would provide a greater all-round health gain.<br>

		<p>so? Zulus can see that they are much more affected by HIV than Xhosa because Xhosa circumcise and they don&rsquo;t. Here they are doing the smart thing by adopting a useful custom. If they do it in a hygienic manner in the hospital, so much the better.</p>

Circumcision, whether done as a religious ritual or tradition or done under sterile hospital conditions is barbaric.</p>
<p>If an adult decides to have it done, as an adult, he has that right. To do it to newborns is unconscionable.</p>

<p>A lot of authorities have voiced their opinion about the various practices of the Bantu tribes that seem to precipitate and foster the transmission of AIDS. Tribal scarification for one thing. Done with the same blade, used over and over, from person to person heedless of any disinfectant or sterilization! Even the most microscopic amount of tainted blood passed from one person to another can give a recipient AIDS! And you can NEVER clean those blades to the desired degree.</p>

		<p>The list of African horrors (and what is it about their perverse, super-evil predellection for genital mutilation and hacking off body parts, raping dogs and tiny babies, cannibalism&hellip;ad nauseam) is just beyond description. Their ignorance burns like the fires of hell, their violence is more  heated than the fury of the sun, their creative sadism is unparalelled. And these things, they unleash on their own family and friends. They are psychosis incarnate. The most extreme manifestation of madness and hiddeous perversion known to man.<br>
Let them ALL be avoided at all costs, for evermore. <br>
Please, let us never have ANY contact.</p>

		<p>Circumcision does a man about as much good as having his teeth filed or getting a tatoo. Every culture needs a right of passage from boyhood to manhood but whittling on a man&rsquo;s johnson has never been a good idea. </p>
<p>Those that have had their genitals mutilated seem to want others to do so, historically.  I guess if a King were dumb enough to cut off his right hand he would brag about what a man it makes him feel like. It&rsquo;s to bad the King didn&rsquo;t get castrated that would really do some good. </p>
<p>If man were ment to be circumcised he would be born circumcised. </p>

		<p>Personally, if this procedure would turn the channel flipping White American couch potato away from the NFL and NBA, and toward camping, shooting, and carpentry, I&rsquo;m for it.  Far too many White males are inkwenkwe, and if circumcision with a broken beer bottle will change that, let the foreskins fly.  </p>

		<p>When blacks in the United States call themselves &#8220;African-Americans,&#8221; they are associating themselves with just these sorts of primitive, barbaric practices. </p>
<p>Frankly, although I do see strong parallels between these kinds of activities and certain traits of black culture in the U.S., I have to ask why American blacks are not being true to their African heritage and visiting &#8220;traditional surgeons&#8221; covered in clay and animal pelts for operations on their genitals using unsterilized communal knives, followed by a month in solitary confinement &#8220;on the mountain,&#8221; interrupted only by visits from the ikangata and warnings to beware the witches of Peddie and not to loaf at the shebeen. </p>
<p>Come on, &#8220;African-Americans&#8221;! Be <i>authentic.</i> If you forsake &#8220;traditional surgery&#8221; and the related rituals in favor of undergoing an operation in a hospital where things such as anesthetic and sterilized implements are used, you are acting white; you&rsquo;re merely a poseur. <br>

<p>Likewise, removing breast tissue would prevent breast cancer. Early removal of the prostate would ensure you never get prostate cancer.</p>

		<p>I dont care what color my president is just as long as he isnt a black. I would rather have a bad non black president than a good black president. I would rather live in a mostly non white nation with a small white population than live in a mostly white country with current black population. </p>
<p>This not an extreme mindset. But this is wow militant they are towards us while we give them welfare checks. We need to be militant towards them in the same manner because they do nothing that benefits us. Unless you watch the NBA.</p>

<p>No, STDs in the United States are far more spread than in Europe, China and India. </p>
<p>People in the US believed circumcision could prevent masturbation and heal epilepsy, some decades ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ancient barbaric tradition (Ancient Egyptians performed it on slaves), overtaken by the Jews, Coptic Christians in North and East Africa (some also perform female circumcision) and Muslims. Even some Jews are against it nowadays.</p>

		<p>Hey, the Jews have practiced circumcision for CENTURIES with no ill effects.  And it DOES cut down on STD&rsquo;s in adults.  It is also a lot more pleasant for a woman to have sex with a circumcised guy - uncircumcised guys are not very often as clean as they should be.  I gave up sleeping with uncircumcised guys after a bout with chlamidya - that was enough to convince me!  </p>

<p>Maybe instead of looking for guys whose ignorant parents had them mutilated at birth, you could try using condoms or even something old-fashioned, like monogamy, to prevent the spread of disease. Just a thought.</p>
<p>The studies that &#8220;proved&#8221; infant circumcision prevents STDs are of dubious value and haven&rsquo;t been convincingly replicated by objective researchers. American hospitals make enormous profits off of selling infant foreskins to cosmetics companies, so it&rsquo;s no wonder they push circumcision as medically necessary.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that a foreskin isn&rsquo;t a birth defect, and such a permanent and life-altering decision is not up to the parents. If a grown man wants to be circumcised, more power to him. Doing it to a helpless child is disgusting and evil and smacks of barbarity.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s true. For what reason do they need them?</p>
<p>Slightly off the topic: Why are parents allowing this? I was circumcised at the age of 12, I still hate my parents because of this. Its psychological effects are lifelong, you can never feel &#8220;100%&#8221;. And yes, I was told at that time that I would be a real man! Seems there is the same lie everywhere&hellip;</p>
