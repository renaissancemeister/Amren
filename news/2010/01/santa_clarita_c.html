<h1>Santa Clarita Councilman Calls Himself &#8216;Proud Racist&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Abram, Los Angeles Daily News, January 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a heated speech at an anti-illegal-immigration rally, a Santa Clarita city councilman called himself a &#8220;proud racist&#8221;  &mdash;  a comment that has outraged some residents and political opponents.</p>
<p>Bob Kellar, who has served on the Santa Clarita council for 10 years, made the remarks at a Jan. 16 rally in Santa Clarita, attended by anti-illegal immigration groups and posted on YouTube.</p>
<p>Kellar stood by his remarks in an interview, saying they reflected his frustration with illegal immigration, but weren&rsquo;t intended to express animosity against nonwhites.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m going to saddle up the horses at midnight,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>At the rally, Kellar first referred to a statement from President Theodore Roosevelt that says the United States only has room for one flag and one language. He said he had quoted it at a past City Council meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing I heard back from a couple of people was &#8216;Bob, you sound like a racist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;That&rsquo;s good. If that&rsquo;s what you think I am because I happen to believe in America, then I&rsquo;m a proud racist. You&rsquo;re darn right I am.&#8221;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some Democrats seized on Kellar&rsquo;s remarks as symbolic of the Republican Party&rsquo;s attitudes toward immigration in general.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The rally, held at the corner of Magic Mountain Parkway and Valencia Boulevard, was attended by members of several groups that are against illegal immigration, including the Santa Clarita Valley Independent Minutemen.</p>
<p>Kellar said he went not as a councilman, but as a resident of Santa Clarita and a concerned American.</p>
<p>In the interview, he said government officials need to stand strong on immigration and good people have been hurt by those who cross the border illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also speaking at the rally was Jamiel Shaw Sr., an African-American whose 17-year-old son was gunned down two years ago allegedly by a 19-year-old illegal immigrant and gang member.</p>
<p>Shaw said he felt as Kellar does.</p>
<p>His son, Jamiel Shaw Jr., was a football player and honor student on his way to UCLA, when he was slain near his Arlington Heights home in 2008. A member of the 18th Street Gang and convicted felon, allegedly in the country illegally, is awaiting trial for the slaying.</p>
<p>&#8220;My son was murdered by an illegal alien that was released from L.A. County jail on a Saturday night and on Sunday night, he had murdered my son,&#8221; Shaw said during the rally. &#8220;No one called (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). No one cared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If this makes me a racist, then hey, I&rsquo;m going to be the best one I can. It&rsquo;s not racist to be pissed off, and I&rsquo;m a pissed-off dad. I miss my son.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such rallies against illegal immigration  &mdash;  as well as those on the other side seeking amnesty and immigration reform  &mdash;  are expected to increase in frequency in coming months as a new reform bill is debated in Congress.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Raymond Herrera, a former spokesman for the Minuteman Project and founder of his own anti-illegal-immigration group, said he opposes amnesty for the undocumented {snip}.</p>
<p>Still Herrera, whose group is called We the People, California&rsquo;s Crusader, agrees with Kellar&rsquo;s views.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Herrera, who said his grandfather came to the United States from Mexico and was a legal citizen, said other Latinos sometimes call him offensive names. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m called a racist and a coconut for saying this,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but we are invaded by illegal aliens that are Hispanic.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t hard to figure out.  Racism doesn&rsquo;t mean anything anymore, so everybody is a racist, or nobody is a racist, pick your poison.  &#8220;Racism&#8221; includes a white politician driving a truck, criticism of John Edwards&rsquo;s morals (or lack thereof), and other things.</p>

		<p>Finally somebody has the huevos to say what we&rsquo;ve all been writing about for ages!!  And I&rsquo;m glad to see the black dude and the Hispanic dude agreeing - WE ARE BEING INVADED by Hispanic people who are illegal, AND a sizeable number of whom are criminals.  This is one reason why we need to get them OUT of California.  Another reason is, we&rsquo;re broke - we used to say &#8220;flat busted!&#8221;  We&rsquo;ve got no money to waste on illegals, as we have been doing up until now.  We need these bozos GONE.  We have enough home-grown criminals, and we need our State services for our LEGAL residents.</p>

		<p>Liberals and hispanic &#8220;activists&#8221; will label Mr. Kellar a racist, nativist,etc.,anyway, I guess he&rsquo;s just anticipating their reaction to his belief that U.S. Immigration Law is valid, and that, therefore, their behavior is utterly criminal. This is the way it always turns out. The real racists that are violating U.S. immigration laws, and those who support them for their own greedy reasons, always label the average taxpaying American that doesn&rsquo;t want to support this subsidized labor, racists. Ho, hum,.ZZZZZnoore&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Of course a nation needs one language and flag, a house divided cannot stand and a country with more than one flag/language is a divided country. Would Mexico fly the American flag alongside theirs or have the English language alongside Spanish? No way, it wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue. </p>

		<p>Look for this sort of thing to only increase in the coming years: people refusing to back down simply because they&rsquo;re called &#8220;racist,&#8221; people refusing to dodge the &#8220;racism&#8221; charge because they just don&rsquo;t fear it any more.  This is quite distinct from actual ethnocentrism, but it&rsquo;s still a welcome change.</p>

		<p>Not only is Mr. Kellar a racist, he is also politically incorrect.  The term &#8216;illegal aliens&rsquo; is highly offensive.  I suggest that he replace it with &#8216;Undocumented Democrats.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>My hat is off to Bob Kellar. I don&rsquo;t know much about his career, but it sounds like here&rsquo;s a rare Republican who is not afraid to stand up and state a clear, unequivocal anti-immigration position. Well done. </p>
<p>Immigration is a fight where those with a pro-white point of view, whether they be registered Republicans or independents can unite in a strong coalition. We have the majority of whites with us. It just takes not being afraid to stand up and be counted. Kellar is only saying something that most whites are thinking.</p>

		<p>Immigration 2010-2011 is supposed to come to a screeching halt, according to some experts who study the situation.</p>
<p>They expect what occurred in Italy the other day, where the townspeople threatened to kill all the black illegals if they didn&rsquo;t get out, to be the norm throughout the West, rather than the exception.</p>
<p>In the Italy situation, the police had to physically remove the blacks for their own safety.</p>

		<p>If a racist is simply someone who is against illegal immigration and mass immigration, then I&rsquo;m a racist, and proud of it.</p>
<p>If a racist is simply someone who recognizes that there are consistent statistical differences in IQ and behavior among the races, and that these differences have consequences, then I&rsquo;m a racist, and proud of it.  I also believe that the earth is round and orbits the sun, which at one time could get you burned as a heretic.</p>
<p>If a racist is someone who threatens or carries out violence against other people because of their race, that would not be me at all, but the Latin Kings or MS-13.<br>

		<p>The interesting point to the mess of California is that no matter how bad off they are fiscally, they won&rsquo;t address cutting off full benefits to illegal aliens. All the mayhem caused by the mexicans is just a biproduct of their receiving handouts.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter now. California will implode and the entire country will see what legalizing illegal aliens will do to their own states.</p>

		<p>Actually, the definition of &#8220;racist&#8221; is nothing more than one who believe in differences between the races, though the term has more recently morphed into one who believes that there are qualitative or substantive differences between races.</p>
<p>In either event, anyone who claims not to be a racist is either a liar, delusional, stupid, willfully in denial, or all four.</p>
