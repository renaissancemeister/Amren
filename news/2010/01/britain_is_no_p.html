			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>London Telegraph, January 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>John Denham is one of the more impressive members of a largely undistinguished Cabinet, and his speech yesterday on race and discrimination was characteristically thoughtful, if disingenuous. Mr Denham is the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, head of a department whose very title signifies the multiculturalist patchwork the country has become. The word &#8220;communities&#8221; is often used as a euphemistic shorthand for ethnic minorities, on whose advancement the Government has concentrated in recent years. So successfully has it done so, said Mr Denham, that &#8220;being black or Asian no longer means being automatically disadvantaged&#8221;. He effectively declared the war on racism over, and claimed it was Labour that won it.</p>
<p>We are not convinced that disadvantage was ever &#8220;automatic&#8221;; many people from ethnic minorities were held back not simply by discrimination, but because they were, by and large, less well-off and poorly educated. Mr Denham traces the improvements to the Race Relations Amendment Act introduced in 2000, after Sir William Macpherson&rsquo;s inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence. But the truth is that things have been getting better for 30 years or more, as a tolerant country has come to terms with being more racially diverse than it once was. As Trevor Phillips, the chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, has observed: &#8220;Britain is by far the best place to live in Europe if you are not white.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is that if you are white  &mdash;  and working-class and male  &mdash;  Britain is not necessarily such a pleasant land. Whereas ethnic minorities, especially those who have arrived relatively recently, tend to have high aspirations, stable homes and make great sacrifices to ensure the best education for their children, the same culture does not pervade white working-class families. Their children, particularly the boys, have for many years been out-performed at school by virtually every other social group, and the decline in heavy industrial jobs that once offered a livelihood to young men with no qualifications has compounded their disadvantages.</p>
<p>It is impossible, however, not to take a cynical view of Mr Denham&rsquo;s somewhat belated recognition of the parlous position of this group. These are the traditional supporters of Labour&rsquo;s heartland, the &#8220;core vote&#8221; that Gordon Brown is desperate to retain, who feel badly let down by the Government and are turning to the BNP.</p>
<p>It will rank as one of the greatest stains on his premiership that such extremists were able to gain an electoral foothold in our country. For all Mr Denham&rsquo;s self-congratulation, that is the true legacy of Labour&rsquo;s years in power.<br>

		<p>This is yet another one in the long series of &#8220;We&rsquo;re&#8221; (and by &#8220;we,&#8221; I mean the major British political party that the newspaper is biased towards   &mdash;   Usually, the Telegraph hearts Tories, but in this case, it&rsquo;s about not-so-New Labour) &#8220;not doing a good enough job in addressing the concerns of the white working class&#8221; or &#8220;addressing terrorism,&#8221; so &#8220;this gives an outlet to &#8216;extremists&rsquo; like the BNP.&#8221;  (Though, like the dog that didn&rsquo;t bark in the Hound of the Baskervilles, they never list the UKIP as such an abhorrent party.  Prima facie evidence, IMHO, that the UKIP is a paid distraction to haul votes away from the BNP.)</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been singing this tune for eight and a half years.  Don&rsquo;t you think that either one of the major parties could have, at least once in that time, actually cared about the white working class?  Or rather, when are they going to stop complaining about how they don&rsquo;t care about the white working class, and actually start caring about the white working class?  All they need to do, by their own admission, is copy the BNP.</p>

		<p>The BNP is at a critical stage right now.  They could stand to make some important gains in their upcoming general election.  They gained a foot hold last year during the election to the EU Parliament.  They&rsquo;re gaining steam fast and are doing a good job of keeping a record much cleaner than the other parties.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a British resident or ex-pat, so I can only donate 200 pounds per year.  But I have, and did last year too.  Even if you don&rsquo;t have too much to give, consider giving them just a little.  (For those who wonder, it shows up on your credit card as a payment to British Heritage.)</p>

		<p>Now we should see democracy at work provided the immoral &amp; devious socialists don&rsquo;t start to &#8216;fix&rsquo; the elections.<br>
If you turn your back on the electorate they will surely throw you out of office.</p>
<p>Lets hope the workers of England get rid of the current &#8220;circus&#8221; as well as the so called conservatives who are just another bunch of blood sucking socialists under a different name.</p>
<p>Give the BNP a fair go England &amp; if they screw it up vote them out as well.  At least do something to save what&rsquo;s left of Great Britain.</p>

		<p>&#8220;the &ldquo;core vote&rdquo; (working class whites) that Gordon Brown is desperate to retain, who feel badly let down by the Government and are turning to the BNP&#8221;.</p>
<p>Other ethnic groups maintain a great deal of solidarity and empathy with their own. Steven Sailor talks about this when examining whites in our own country. Well-to-do and &#8216;upwardly mobile&rsquo; whites often vote for immigration and &#8216;minority&rsquo; rights. There just aren&rsquo;t enough low income whites (and where they exist they must always be helped with &#8216;integration&rsquo;) to put the BNP over the top and into complete power. For this, working class whites need the help of the middle and uppermiddle class. The sympathy of these groups&hellip; Something tells me when this article discusses the importance of the murder of Stephen Lawrence, Stephen Lawrence is not a member of the light colored race. Which is a shame because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really going on in multicult paradise, and that&rsquo;s the way it really works for most of it&rsquo;s citizens. </p>

		<p>   I was watching some news program on TV and there was this lady on there stating, &#8221; If you find yourself umemployed,don&rsquo;t blame the new immigrants, blame your personal computer.&#8221; And I thought, this is so absurd . Computers are great etc. but they are not required . What is required by all civilized nations, even some who are not so civilized, are manufactured goods . China understands this and so does India .Manufacturing is what produces jobs and stability . Not some bizarre notion of a, &#8221; service oriented economy,&#8221; that our government and media has been pushing since the early eighties .One has to wonder sometimes if there is a method to their madness . There have been charges all the way back to the sixties of an effort to eradicate the American middleclass .Bringing our poplace down to the level of the third world . Just today I was flipping through a &#8216;65 news magazine and one of the articles was titled,&#8221; Plenty of Jobs but No One to Fill Them.&#8221; Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a good problem to have these days ? I couldn&rsquo;t help but think that this article was written about the same time that liberals pushed through the Immigration Bill of 1965 along with a host of other bills from that era that have irreparably damaged our nation .     </p>

		<p>Strange but nearly all the children discovered in Britain  over the last few years as &#8216;prodigies&rsquo; or geniuses and measured with the highest IQs,  have all been White and British - bar one Asian child)and as an added  bonus to our country - Englsh too. Even more remarkably these children have often come from working class backgrounds too. Otherwise these liars and media manipulators are going by the stats collected from inner city schools where  the white children  of the more affluent parents  have white flighted out  leaving the few poorer working class children behind  to mingle with the morass of third worlders whom in turn get most of all the available help and resources  in helping them to succeed. (So do ignore these liars.) I did in fact have  a link where this very problem was being discussed on a blogsite and where it was shown that in certain local authorities schools over run with E/M s were being offered generous incentives in helping these newly arrived &#8216;Britons&rsquo;   to achieve. </p>

		<p>If you ever visit London and go shopping along Oxford Street&rsquo;s many large department stores, don&rsquo;t expect to be waited upon by white English citizens, especially young white males.  You will see Nigerians, Asians, Indians, etc. holding many of these positions.  The experience like watching the successful TV show, &#8220;Are You Being Waiting On.&#8221;  I was really surprised on my first visit there.  I stayed at a nearby hotel that is subsidized by the government for active members of their armed forces, veterans, and their allies which of course includes the USA.  Even there the office help, hotel staff, and wait staff in the restaurants were mostly immigrants.  Some like the Nigerian woman employee I met had a huge attitude problem.  There are many Arab owned businesses in the immediate area which borders on the Mayfair district.  There are still English cab drivers about but I rarely met or saw English workmen about.  Maybe it is different in the smaller towns throughout England but I&rsquo;m not sure about that as I haven&rsquo;t gotten around that much.  Their economy does depend upon the tourist trade to a great extent, but even places as the British Museum you&rsquo;ll see lots of non-English employees.  I&rsquo;m sure the average young Engloish male could handle such jobs but either they are not applying for them, or the elites would rather they be filled by immigrants from the third world countries.</p>

<p>  May this quote turn into a prophesy! The BNP is not ideal but they will stop Third World immigration to Britain, which is something the Conservative Party will never do. I wish the BNP had a different political history but it is the only party that represents the indigenous people of Great Britain today.</p>

		<p>For all these do-gooders that love to be liberal because they&rsquo;re saving everything&hellip; minorities, environment, animals, etc. yet they rally around the most rabid namecallers on the planet.  Even if I towed the Liberal line, I would be totally turned off by the neverending personal attacks so frequent in Liberal/Marxist circles.  There is no diplomacy whatsoever with them!!!  They&rsquo;re the biggest fearmongers of us all!<br>

		<p>Lakeview Senior:<br>
Made some very interesting observations on his trip to London,not least the over-representation of aliens in the workforce.It should be pointed out that native born candidates for any prospective job/career must supply evidence of qualifications,a full employment record,a CV,and at least two character references to even make the interview stage.No such conditions seem to apply to the third-world interlopers,many of whom barely understand English,most of whom have entered here illegally.</p>

		<p>What is wrong with parents having high aspirations for their children? These are the parents that monitor their children&rsquo;s education and are willing to sacrifice to make sure that their children do better than they do. I wonder if the white working class families value education like many immigrant families do? If they did, there would be no complaints about the immigrants because they can compete on a level playing field that they cannot do now. I think that the government should encourge and fund Ph.D degrees for those Americans who are majoring in math and sciences. This would limit the need for visas for international students who get the majority of Ph.d&rsquo;s in this country.</p>
