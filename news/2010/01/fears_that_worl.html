<h1>Fears That World Cup Could Increase Spread of HIV</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Tutton, CNN, January 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Advocates for sex workers in South Africa have warned that this summer&rsquo;s World Cup could be a public health disaster.</p>
<p>With up to half a million football fans expected to visit South Africa for the World Cup, and up to half of South Africa&rsquo;s prostitutes carrying the HIV virus, there have been calls for the country to decriminalize prostitution to help tackle the spread of HIV.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The UN estimates that in South Africa 5.7 million people are HIV positive, more than in any other country. A 2005 University of Michigan study found that 46 percent of female sex workers in Johannesburg had HIV.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Harper [Eric Harper, director of the Cape Town-based Sex Worker Education and Advocacy Taskforce (SWEAT),] said HIV is just one of the dangers faced by South Africa&rsquo;s sex workers. As well as the risk of contracting other STIs, there is the chance of unwanted pregnancies and the ever-present threat of violence and rape.</p>
<p>Prostitution is illegal in South Africa, but the law is currently being reviewed as part of a larger assessment of all sexual offenses. Harper believes decriminalizing prostitution can help control the spread of HIV.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Harper argued that criminalization drives prostitution underground. He said that removing the threat of prosecution would make it easier to provide sex workers with condoms and make it easier for sex workers to turn down clients who refuse to use condoms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Julian Seedat of the South African National AIDS Council, which advises the government on HIV and AIDS, is also expecting an increase in prostitution during the World Cup, but he is more optimistic about the health implications.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think the World Cup will necessarily bring an increased risk of the spread of HIV,&#8221; he told CNN.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the years there has been an incredible amount of education and awareness work done among sex workers. Years ago the high-risk groups were thought to be homosexuals and sex workers, but there has been such a focus on education for these groups that their behavior has really changed. It&rsquo;s quite the norm for a commercial sex worker to have a bag full of condoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Harper said most sex workers do practice safe sex, but many clients don&rsquo;t want to use a condom. He added that as long as prostitution remains illegal, protecting sex workers and their clients during the World Cup would be problematic.</p>
<p>He told CNN, &#8220;We have to make condoms freely available and we have to make it possible for sex workers to report human rights violations like child prostitution and people trafficking.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I find it hard to believe that white men, after all that is who the overwhelming majority of the fans will be, will have sex with diseased African prostitutes.</p>
<p>The odds of catching AIDS from a prostitute, even if not using a condom, are very low.</p>
<p>Violence against fans is however very likely. AR highlighted the case of the Irish actress who was shot by a gang yesterday.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s only a disaster if people sleep with them.  Frankly I can&rsquo;t imagine any White man or any man of any race (except black) that would travel all the way to South Africa to sleep with a disease infected hoochie.  I can however picture one of our African diaspora here in America doing just that.  Oh well.  C&rsquo;est la vie.</p>

		<p>This is a valid concern. Any non-Black foolish enough to attend the football championships would be foolish enough to have unprotected with a SA prostitute. <br>
Also, do not assume that these prostitutes are all female; many are male who service men and women in a wide variety of ways, some of which transmit HIV.</p>

		<p>Of course, they&rsquo;re not mentioning all the female (and possibly, male) visitors who WILL BE violently raped during the World Cup.  Frankly, I see that as a more likely vector for the disease than prostitution.  It&rsquo;s a safe assumption that most European visitors will&hellip;ahem&hellip;&rsquo;take precautions&rsquo; when patronizing South African prostitutes.  Rape victims don&rsquo;t have that option.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Half of South Africa&rsquo;s prostitutes are infected with the HIV virus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anybody that attends that event is a fool, pure and simple.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t catch aids, they&rsquo;ll very likely be mugged, murdered, or both. <br>

		<p>I hope the blacks in S.A won&rsquo;t let us down by behaving themselves. I&rsquo;m sure they won&rsquo;t though. And hopefully the White liberals that will be there [ I may be wrong, but I can&rsquo;t imagine a White realist going there ] will get a good dose of diversity training up close and personal. </p>

		<p>That the rate of HIV and other STDs is high in South Africa has nothing to do with the legal status of prostitution.  It will be high if prostitution is legal, and it will be (in fact, it is) high in the present state of prostitution being illegal.  </p>
<p>The main reason why South Africa&rsquo;s STD rate is high is because of black sexual promiscuity.</p>
<p>As for the World Cup, those that go would be lucky to leave only with an STD, because they would be leaving South Africa alive at least.  Violent crime is the most acute danger.</p>

		<p>The UN figures for HIV positive infection are way off the truth.<br>
+- 35% of the population are HIV +.<br>
35% of 45 million = 15.75 million.</p>
<p>UN numbers are based on South African census numbers which have been doctored as are their crime statistics. In fact the crime statisitics are not released by the so called police authorities.<br>
After all the policing is so screwed up that private security companies are hired to protect police stations from burglary &amp; attack.</p>

		<p>A sex worker by any other name is still a prostitute.</p>
<p>I fear for the safety of the Caucasians who will be going to the World Cup. I honestly believe that they think the new South Africa is like that portrayed in the the 1960&rsquo;s television series &#8220;Daktari&#8221;. Heck, some Europeans especially, will think South Africa is a pleasant place to be in, since the fall of apartheid. They&rsquo;ll be in for a rude awakening.</p>
<p>FIFA, please change the venue, it&rsquo;s not too late. </p>

		<p>It is hard to believe that a White man (or an East Asian man) will find taking the services of an African prostitute appealing. Yuck, the thought of it is disgusting to me. Media propaganda has made us mad. Such desperate men of poor taste deserve what they get.</p>

		<p>  I bet it&rsquo;s the same rate of HIV for black prostitutes in the United States or Canada. Many of these prostitutes are drug addicted and that&rsquo;s where the infection comes from. I believe that any white would be foolish to attend the World Cup in South Africa  &mdash;  its crime rates are some of the highest in the world. </p>

		<p>I live in South Africa. To those who question whether white tourists would want to use black prostitutes: you bet! It is embarrassing to see especially German male tourists in Cape Town openly consorting with black prostitutes when my family and I go there on holiday. (No, I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s particularly the Germans who like the dark ones so much either.) </p>
<p>You will typically spot them at pricy restaurants with one and often two of these ladies of the night, whom you can recognize by the latter being obviously out of place. It&rsquo;s often European men past their sell-by date with very young black prostitutes that you&rsquo;d see.</p>
<p>Never underestimate the moral depravity of some of your fellow whites, especially those of a liberal persuasion. Remember: the main sponsors and biggest fans of South Africa&rsquo;s current black Marxist ANC government, even during the ANC&rsquo;s campaign of terror it waged against us, the Afrikaners, were liberal northern and western Europeans, especially the Scandinavians.<br>

		<p>Maybe the stories coming back to Europe from the visiting soccer/football fans will be rewarding.  Some here have mentioned how Europeans tend to believe the hype about post-Apatheid South Africa being a utopia of peaceful diversity, so maybe this is exactly what some of the Europeans need to see up close and personal.  I do not wish danger or violence on any visitors, but I hope they at least get to see the reality of how South Africa is now.</p>

		<p>I am totally with Anton (Post #14). Living here in Cape Town, when we see a European with a black lady (or two), we instantly say &#8220;must be a German&#8221;.  Dont know why, but generally it is the older German males that pick them up.  One Scandanavian bloke married one (a black, not neccesarily a prostitute), lived in Somerset West.  She got her brothers to murder him.<br>
And please, I am not anti German.  They make the best cars, best F1 drivers etc. I love them to bits, especially their &#8220;frauleins&#8221; at he beerfest.  But why, oh why, must they go for the darker race?<br>
Anyway, my advice to SWC spectators coming out here, be afraid, be very afraid.  LOL.</p>
