<h1>Desperate Somalis Seek &#8216;Back-Door&rsquo; Route to US</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Taxin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Jan. 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The asylum seeker from Somalia hung his head as an immigration judge grilled him about his treacherous journey from the Horn of Africa. By air, sea and land he finally made it to Mexico, and then a taxi delivered him into the arms of U.S. border agents at San Diego.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kheire is one of hundreds of desperate Somalis in the last two years to have staked everything on a wild asylum gamble by following immigration routes to the United States traditionally traveled by Latinos.</p>
<p>With the suspension of a U.S. refugee program and stepped-up security in the Gulf of Aden and along Mediterranean smuggling routes, more overseas migrants from Somalia are pursuing asylum through what one expert calls the &#8220;back door.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 1,500 people from around the world showed up in U.S. airports and on the borders seeking asylum during the 2009 fiscal year, according to statistics from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p>
<p>Somalis were the biggest group to make the journey, with most arriving in San Diego. More than 240 Somalis arrived during that period  &mdash;  more than twice the number from the year before.</p>
<p>Like Kheire, they have been shuttled to immigration detention centers in California while legal advocates have scurried to find lawyers and translators to help them navigate the country&rsquo;s immigration courts.</p>
<p>Many end up defending themselves. Those who lose may remain temporarily. Somalis may be deported, but immigrant advocates say authorities often do not send them back immediately because of difficulties making the trip.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most Somalis have reached the United States  &mdash;  there are some 87,000 here  &mdash;  through U.S.-sponsored refugee resettlement programs. But the State Department in 2008 suspended a family reunification program for refugees over fraud concerns. The number of Somalis admitted by refugee programs dwindled to about 4,000 last year.</p>
<p>Those now traveling through Latin America are taking a path well-worn by asylum seekers from other countries. Immigration attorneys say they have worked with clients from Ethiopia and Iraq who also reached the United States via Mexico.</p>
<p>Ronald Smith, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said most asylum seekers arrive in U.S. airports  &mdash;  not on the southern border. However, asylum experts said more people may now be seeking to come here by land due to tighter travel restrictions.</p>
<p>&#8220;To get a flight from Africa to Europe is very hard. The easiest place to go is America,&#8221; said Yahya Idardon, an asylum seeker who fled Somalia last year after his father and brother were killed. &#8220;Africa to Latin America is easy &hellip; when you are going to Latin America, no one is concerned about you, no one is asking, so it is easy to go there and cross all these countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once reaching the U.S. border in San Diego, Somalis are frisked and fingerprinted and screened by an asylum officer to gauge whether they have a credible fear of returning home.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several Somalis said they never expected to be detained  &mdash;  especially since they didn&rsquo;t try to sneak across the border.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re coming to the United States, which is a symbol of freedom and democracy around the world,&#8221; said immigration attorney Lyall, who represented Kheire. &#8220;They&rsquo;re not expecting to go to jail and be fed bologna sandwiches.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Jan. 4, the government plans to start releasing many asylum seekers while they wait for their immigration cases to be heard. It is unclear how many Somalis will be let out as they must prove their identity and many don&rsquo;t have documents. And still others say they have nowhere to go even if they were freed, their attorneys said.</p>

		<p>Under strict interpretation of the relevant treaties, the USA is fully entitled to dismiss their &#8216;asylum&rsquo; applications on the grounds that the swindlers actually have gained entry into a safe transit country.<br>
 But of course, such a logical, clear-cut, simple and correct judegement holds no water with the elite that runs the USA.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s 80,000 refugees admitted into the US every year and they&rsquo;re contributing to the displacement whites as the majority group using taxes from the white majority.</p>

		<p>As as they&rsquo;re caught these invaders should be returned to Somalia by slow freighter and in chains.  And we should drop leaflets over the Somali countryside to warn would-be illegals that they&rsquo;ll be turned back upon arrival and returned under most unpleasant conditions.</p>

		<p>Like many Hispanics and Muslims, the Somalis are inspired to come to the United States because the United States government has sent a clear signal to the world that it refuses to enforce its own immigration laws or protect its own borders. Illegal immigrants are quite welcomed by the United States government.</p>
<p>In fact, not only does the U.S. government ignore its own federal immigration laws, but it castigates American citizens who question why the immigration laws are not enforced. Plus, the government ensures that illegal immigrants are given drivers licenses, work and business permits, free housing, free health benefits, free education, asolcial security benefits, voting rights, special protections, and tax exemptions! Why in God&rsquo;s name wouldn&rsquo;t they come here? The government has made it quite clear that they are valued more than American citizens!</p>

		<p>Here is the end of the article, which I read in the LA Times (and only because it was thrown on my driveway by accident and my neighbors refused to claim it):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The attorneys for Kheire and the government sat quietly in the courtroom, listening to the judge read the ruling as Kheire prayed.</p>
<p>A Somali interpreter whispered urgently into Kheire&rsquo;s ear. He broke into a hesitant smile. He would be allowed to stay.</p>
<p>&#8216;They said, &#8216;This is America. Welcome to the United States of America,&rsquo; Kheire said&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Great.  One more welfare parasite added to California&rsquo;s out of control welfare rolls.  How soon before he to imports the rest of his family and start the daisy chain of endless &#8216;family&rsquo; migration?</p>
<p>Unskilled, uneducated welfare liabilities are allowed to remain despite huge unemployment rates and shrinking state budgets  &mdash;  yet White South Africans who are being systematically killed by black africans are denied asylum or refugee status in the US.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d cite my source but sasucks.com has been taken down due threats against the moderator and his family.  Here&rsquo;s an older post:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Brandon Huntley is the South African who was granted asylum in Canada because of the violent persecution he claims he faced for being white.</p>
<p>He claimed he was attacked seven times - including three stabbings - by blacks during attempted robberies and muggings when he lived in the country.</p>
<p>During the alleged attacks, Huntley told the refugee board, he was called &#8216;a white dog&rsquo; and &#8216;a settler&rsquo; he tells of innocent people having their land taken away, being murdered, raped, babies tortured and left for dead, while the government turns a blind eye.</p>
<p>South African authorities and human rights groups have slammed a Canadian decision to grant asylum to Huntley&hellip;.chairman of the refugee lobby group Passop  called the decision &#8216;amazing, outstanding and insulting.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yl2llk4" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yl2llk4</a></p>
<p>Yet any black African can tell a similar story and his picture is plastered on the front pages, a sympathetic portrait is written about him and the &#8216;fear&rsquo; he feels about returning to his own home country and the US government and human rights groups fall all over themselves to admit these worthless parasites into the US as asylees.   </p>
<p>You can bet if a black african were denied asylum, the msm and every human rights group on earth would have called the judge a racist Nazi. </p>
<p>If this is not an outright war on Whites, I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>

<p>Oh, why oh why is this country supposed to be the dumping ground for the rest of the world&rsquo;s misfits, when those said misfits come from an alien culture and religion to most Americans?  What is it they expect?  To just be able to walk in and enjoy the benefits they had no part in making, that they have no birthright to enjoy?  </p>
<p>Actually, it isn&rsquo;t the fault of the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; so much as it is the lawyers such as Lyall who want to turn our country into some third-world banana republic, Leftist dictatorial dump, like a large version of Nicaragua.</p>

<p>What difference does that make? They <i>all</i> have a credible fear of returning home. Somalia is a pesthole, and a dangerous one to boot. If we let one in, we&rsquo;d have to let them all in. Then, they will make our streets and neighborhoods the same deadly places they&rsquo;ve made their own country.</p>

<p>I totally agree. In a sane world, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect these leeches would be laying around in jail eating bologna sandwiches on my dime either. I would expect they&rsquo;d be booted back to Mexico to retrace their way back home.   </p>

		<p>They all want to come here, since it is the symbol of freedom and democracy. It is in fact still a land of opportunity. But when they get here, it usually doesn&rsquo;t suit them. They want to change it to bend it more to their ways. They think that the place, the land, is somehow magic, and it will make them prosper even if they don&rsquo;t earn it. When they are disappointed they try to make changes, and they are often successful. What few of them realize is that there is no magic in the land. The place itself is just a place - like so many others on earth. It is the freedoms that our founders put in place that make this place so &#8216;magic&rsquo;. What they don&rsquo;t realize is that when they make &#8216;there&rsquo; bend to suit them&hellip; there will be no &#8216;there&rsquo; there! And there will be no place left to run!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;To get a flight from Africa to Europe is very hard. The easiest place to go is America,&rdquo; said Yahya Idardon</p>
<p>Oh really?  Why do they always choose white countries in the Dar-Al-Harb (home of the unbelievers) as a place to flee to; why do they not seek shelter in Dar-Al-Islam and go to their religious brothers in Sudan, Egypt, Iran, Turkey, Jordan or Saudi Arabia - countries that are much closer geographically and culturally to their screwed homeland?<br>
The answer: Although both are Muslims, Arabs despise blacks with passion and treat them like dirt.</p>
<p>So it is indeed a smart choice for Somalis to enter the nations of cowards (and by that I mean Europe, US and the rest of the white world) where they are received and treated with open arms.<br>
Now after the attempted bombing of the Delta flight to Detroit and the attempted murder of the Danish Mohammed cartoonist by a Somali, the CIA, FBI, Obama et al. would be better off focusing and spending money on border protection in San Diego instead of putting their nose in Yemen. Expect that some of the Somalian refugees are sympathizers or even members of the Quaida-related Al-Shabaab group who seek to commit terrorist attacks on US soil.</p>

		<p>Why can&rsquo;t black people create a government that doesn&rsquo;t promote its citizens to flee to white nations? Is this what is called the white mans burden? Several hundred years ago the black slavers prostituted their fellow blacks to us, which led up to the war between north and south with bitternes still remaining. The freed and free blacks after emancipation, for the most part did not want to go back to Africa and still blacks do all they can to live amongst whites,with law suits, marches, violence etc.. If the white and black race were truly equal.. why would these patterns exist. I do care for the dignity of all humans as well as the earth but isn&rsquo;t freedom about self reliance and isn&rsquo;t slavery the surrender of your freedom in exchange for being taken care of?</p>

		<p>NONwhites were never suppose to be included in our form of &#8220;democracy&#8221;, rather a REPUBLIC. They are NOT self-governing to begin with, nor Christian, as we see the proof in all their nations. </p>
<p>The Founders NEVER meant this nation to be a calling to all 3rd world peoples and most of us here know that, don&rsquo;t we? We were meant to be a White Christian nation and a BEACON as to what other 3rd worlds should emulate, period! We were never meant to entangle ourselves and bear their burdens.

		<p>Somalis are pirates, kidnappers, Jihadists, fraudsters, khat-chewers, welfare-cheats, illegal border jumpers, street gang members, drug dealers, suicide bombers, warlords, smugglers, and general adversaries of the West.</p>
<p>They are nomads in search of easy pickings. It&rsquo;s too easy for them to get on welfare, and then use wire transfers to send money back to their clan so that more of their people can fly here from the airports of Kenya.  </p>

<p>There is a thing about Saudi that many don&rsquo;t know. In Kuwait, first class citizens (there are 8 classes) get a stipend from national revenue along with a job and schooling for free. In SAUDI ALL of the wealth stays with the &#8220;royal&#8221; family, NONE is apportioned to other citizens in any form. There are Arab Saudis citizens that live in poverty to rival Detroit or chiCONGO! In general, the Kuwaitis look down on people and the Saudi &#8220;royals&#8221; look down in the Kuwaitis. And TRUE! the Arab muslims hate  blacks and consider them good only for slave labor, and they&rsquo;re right!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;SAN DIEGO, CA  &mdash;  (Marketwire - November 11, 2009) - Abdi Farah and Amran Abdi finally have a place of their own to call home, thanks to the National Association of Realtors® and San Diego Habitat for Humanity. The family was presented with the keys to their new home during a dedication ceremony today.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;The future homeowners, Abdi and Amran are natives of Somalia and spent their early years in refugee camps. They are now U.S. citizens and are very excited for the opportunity to own their own home.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;The family   &mdash;   which includes Amran&rsquo;s 21-year-old brother Abdijaber, a college student   &mdash;   previously lived in a small two-bedroom apartment in a crime-ridden area. The apartment leaked, had poor water quality and was often cold in winter. Their new Habitat house will offer the family more space and a small backyard for the children to play.&#8221; </p>
