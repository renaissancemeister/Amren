			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pat Buchanan, Townhall, January 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama defeated John McCain by winning the black vote 24 to one, the Hispanic vote two to one and taking a larger share of the white vote, 44 percent, than did John Kerry or Al Gore. As the white vote was three-fourths of the national turnout, Obama coasted to victory.</p>
<p>Now consider Massachusetts. In the 2008 election, no less than 79 percent of the voters were white, and Obama carried them by 20 points, winning the state 62 to 36.</p>
<p>How did Scott Brown turn that 26-point deficit into a six-point victory? By winning the white vote as massively as did Obama. {snip}</p>
<p>Bob McDonnell won the Virginia governor&rsquo;s race by 17, while McCain lost Virginia by six. As McDonnell did equally poorly with African-Americans, losing the black vote 90 to nine, while McCain&rsquo;s lost it 92 to eight, what explains his Virginia landslide?</p>
<p>The white vote. McDonnell won Virginia&rsquo;s white vote 68 to 32, though his opponent was a downstate Democrat more conservative than the Northern Virginia candidates he beat in the primary.</p>
<p>In New Jersey, same story. McCain won 8 percent of the black vote. Gov. Chris Christie won 8 percent of the black vote. How did Christie turn a McCain loss of New Jersey by 16 points into a five-point victory?</p>
<p>The white vote. McCain won the white vote in New Jersey 50 to 49, but Christie won the white vote 59 to 34, almost two to one.</p>
<p>Republicans have won three major races  &mdash;  two of them upsets and one a Massachusetts miracle  &mdash;  because the white share of the vote in all three rose as a share of the total vote, and Republicans swept the white vote in Reagan-like landslides.</p>
<p>What explains the white surge to the GOP?</p>
<p>First, sinking white support for Obama, seen as ineffectual in ending the recession and stopping the loss of jobs.</p>
<p>Second, a growing perception that Obama is biased. When the president blurted that the Cambridge cops and Sgt. James Crowley &#8220;acted stupidly&#8221; in arresting black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates  &mdash;  a rush to judgment that proved wrong  &mdash;  his support sank in white America {snip}.</p>
<p>Then there was Obama&rsquo;s appointment of Puerto Rican American Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. Her militant support for race and ethnic preferences and her decision to deny Frank Ricci and the white firefighters of New Haven a hearing on their case that they were denied promotions they won in competitive exams because they were white caused 31 GOP senators to vote against her.</p>
<p>While Massachusetts is Democrat over Republican three to one, Reagan carried the state in 1984 and Hillary Clinton clobbered Obama in the 2008 primary, though the Kennedys were in Obama&rsquo;s corner. The Scott Brown Democrats were the Hillary Democrats were the Reagan Democrats.</p>
<p>But {snip} why did McCain lose all three?</p>
<p>Answer: In 2008, the working and middle class had had a bellyful of the Bush-McCain Republicans. They were seen as pro-amnesty for illegal aliens and pro-NAFTA, when U.S. workers had watched 5 million manufacturing jobs disappear in a decade  &mdash;  and reappear in China. They were willing to give Obama a chance because Obama had persuaded them by November he was not just another big-spending utopian liberal.</p>
<p>So what have Obama and Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi been doing for a year? Crafting a federal takeover of health care with a vast plan that provides coverage for the uninsured  &mdash;  most of whom are minorities  &mdash;  while sticking it to Medicare recipients, 80 percent to 90 percent of whom are white.</p>
<p>Immigrants are 21 percent of the uninsured, but only 7 percent of the population. This means white folks on Medicare or headed there will see benefits curtailed, while new arrivals from the Third World, whence almost all immigrants come, get taxpayer-subsidized health insurance. {snip}</p>
<p>What the McDonnell, Christie and Brown victories teach is that the GOP should stop listening to the Wall Street Journal and start listening to these forgotten Americans.</p>
<p>An end to affirmative action and ethnic preferences, an end to bailouts of Wall Street bankers, a moratorium on immigration until unemployment falls to 6 percent, an industrial policy that creates jobs here and stops shipping them to China appear a winning hand in 2012.<br>

		<p>I read this article this morning on Vdare.com. I fully agree with it.</p>
<p>The author makes the point that the reason for the recent GOP winnings was due to actually representing their base: white, middle class Americans.</p>
<p>Scott Brown won the election in Massachusettes for senator because voters recognized that, unlike his opponent, he wasn&rsquo;t a stuck-up elitist and had the people&rsquo;s best interests in mind.</p>
<p>The exact opposite happened with John McCain.</p>
<p>John McCain betrayed his base by supporting amnesty for illegal aliens. He reluctantly and grudgingly supported secure borders, but I doubt he was sincere. Basically, he didn&rsquo;t represent the interests of his base. As a result, he lost the election by a lot.</p>
<p>I certainly hope the Republicans have learned their lesson now. Hopefully the GOP will be wise enough to nominate a presidential candidate for the 2012 elections who has the people&rsquo;s best interest in mind, unlike John McCain.</p>
<p>I think Obama is just a one-term president. His support, especially among whites, who comprise three quarters of all voters, is falling rapidly. If the GOP is smart, it will nominate a good politician to run for president.</p>

		<p>The problem is the two party system; had we a third party which could have disowned the Wall Street Republicans and embraced white working class concerns the decades we have lost wouldn&rsquo;t have been so. How many more years can be lost? It is rather academic now. By obscuring the cause Mr Buchanan makes his points seem powerful. Actually the reason for his rhetorical power is not a program which can win but a despair which won&rsquo;t go away. The oligarchs in control of the country have controlling votes in both parties.<br>
Imagine: &#8220;our&#8221; country importing millions of immigrants for decades and then wondering where the white vote went. A lot of it stays home. But it needn&rsquo;t be this way.<br>
Sooner or later, as Peter Brimelow has stated, the country cannot hold together. Too many linguistic,ethnic,and cultural divisions to handle, and an established history of separatist movements mean secession is not only likely, it is inevitable.The pain will be great for a decade or longer but the alternative is lifetimes worth of poverty, and long slow dysfunction leading to a sinister South African-type state. <br>
 The federal government is in bankruptcy court. Conceivably how is the government of the USA going to &#8220;get the nation going again&#8221;?</p>

		<p>A perceptive article, and I would only add other revealing Obama moves such as &#8216;green czar&rsquo; Van Jones or the Napolitano report equating returned vets, 911 skeptics, and anti-immigration activists with terrorists. </p>
<p>Obama wants Whites to believe that he sat in Rev. Wright&rsquo;s church for 20+ years and never absorbed the anti-White rhetoric spewed from the pulpit. B.H.O. is a perfect illustration of my maxim &#8216;never expect gratitude&rsquo;. B.H.O. was given everything by  his White grandparents, affirmative action, and a largely White electorate, but he does not feel grateful-quite the contrary.</p>

		<p>Did Obama ever have White America?  Obama only got 43% of the White vote, and much of that was driven by revulsion against lying Republicans, a despicable John McCain, and an incompetent Bush. (I&rsquo;m gonna civilize the Afghans, daddy, just watch me!!)</p>
<p>Obama is the leader of the democrats.  His administration is really Clinton II, just without the Clintons.  The democrats fired the Clintons, a story no one seems to have picked up on, any more than anyone has picked up upon the fact that all of Obama&rsquo;s inner circle is White.  He has appointed token representatives from all the deviant groups to various symbolic but irrelevant outposts, yet he is the face of White marxism, not black anger.</p>
<p>Whites must reject the sick minded religion of marxism or face oblivion.  But what is the racially conscious political alternative?  It sure isn&rsquo;t the pusillanimous republicans.</p>

		<p>In the Massachusetts Senate race, no exit polls are necessary to confirm that a voter&rsquo;s race was the critical factor in determining how that person would vote.  Anyone familiar with the demographics of the state could confirm this with a cursory glance at the town/precinct results.      </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see Republicans as evil, but I do see them as spineless. That&rsquo;s why they won&rsquo;t take the huge plum of the white vote which is just hanging there waiting to be picked. More important, more important by far to be in the good graces of all the safe, protected, right thinking, inside the beltway, gated community, proper whites than to save unprotected ordinary whites from racial and cultural assault. It would be so simple. A Republican pledge to overturn the 1964 Immigration Act and genuinely seal the borders and the party would sweep back intro power. But it won&rsquo;t do it. The terror, the absolute terror of not being seen as respectable freezes Republicans in their tracks.   </p>

		<p>Buchanan is right on the money and things are only going to get worst for Obama. Allowing Holder to try terrorists in NYC and giving the Xmas bomber Miranda rights have OUTRAGED <br>
Americans.  (This was also Holder&rsquo;s decision.)<br>
The goal now is to shut Obama down before he causes more damage to America.  On top of everything, Obama is still blaming Bush for all his problems.  We can also thank the MSM for its complete support of Obama.</p>

		<p>Buchanan is right of course, but the turn to Republicanism wont help Whites. They&rsquo;re going to the wrong place. Scott Brown is a perfect example: the man who claims no secret alliances is obviously already the darling of the Republicans. And he must have already taken their money to win in Massachusetts. He had alot of TV ads and that isn&rsquo;t cheap And last but not least, his mentor is McCain. That about says it all I think.</p>

		<p>The Mass. election results stunned and even more, infuriated the big O. But since it was the voters who made the choice there was no one he could take to task over it and bully &amp; bribe into changing their vote. So, as appears to be his habit, when he didn&rsquo;t get his way he made a quick turn to another issue to divert the attention and took his anger out on the banking industry. (Ever notice how the government&rsquo;s obsession with the H1N1 flu shot came to a screeching halt and hasn&rsquo;t been mentioned again?)</p>
<p>All but the most radical leftists are noticing the administration of the big O is imploding.</p>

		<p>Not to be a party pooper or the arbiter of gloom and doom but I am not as sanguine about the Massachusetts election as some of you posters seem to be nor am I convinced that Obama is a one term president.</p>
<p>While I admire Pat Buchanan and he is right on many issues, the fact is that the &#8220;supposedly conservative &#8221; Scott Brown is not all that conservative as he is being portrayed by the media. First, he is pro-choice. He supports limited affirmative action, he consistently praised Ted Kennedy. The fact is that he is a Massachusetts republican in the William Weld, Edward Brooke, Jane Swift mold. Republicans in Massachusetts are RINOs! They are democrat lite.</p>
<p>Secondly, in his victory speech he spoke about maintaining the legacy of Ted Kennedy. His nude centerfold profile in the 1980 should draw suspicion as well. I am not a prude, but this is not the sort of person that would be a true, red blooded conservative, at least organically. Quite frankly, his conservatism seems contrived, ingenuous and opportunistic. It is probably safe to say that after a few weeks, no one will be discussing Senator elect Brown.</p>
<p>In regards to President Obama, I believe that the media is currently throwing out the gloom and doom scenario in an effort to mislead the public. I can guarantee you by late 2010 or early next year, the supposedly &#8220;in trouble&#8221; Obama will be resurrected by the supposedly &#8220;objective&#8221; media and if he economy improves with many leading economists saying it will, he will be their darling and they will be even more overt about it. Trust me, some form of health care will be passed by Congress (corporate and lobbyist favored) and the Obama loving media will spin it as major victory.   </p>
<p>Given the short tension spans of the majority of the American public, his current situation will be a distant memory and largely forgotten and he will probably be on the road (I hope not) to reelection in 2012. The media will demonize who ever the republican nominee is</p>
<p>This is how I see it.</p>

So, so true!<br>
One can tell instantly that Mr. Brown isn&rsquo;t going to buck any traditions, is he?<br>
He&rsquo;s going to settle in and ride that gravy train. He is NOT our friend. (Who are WE?) Americans.<br>
He&rsquo;s an opportunist, a careerist. And the poster just before you, mentioned that farse, ATTY GENERAL Eric Holder, deciding on regular criminal trials for Jihaddists. Insane, for sure. But recall who called Holder to the carpet so sarcastically in Congressional hearings? Why, our own traitor, South Carolina Republican Senator, Lindsey Graham. He nearly licked the boots of La Raza last year. Man, what a squirming, pathetic, venal performance THAT was. Just disgusting. And McInsane&hellip;&rsquo;nuff said.</p>
<p>We have few, if any representatives at all. We are without any friends in the establishment. Americans stand as they did in Colonial times&hellip;alone.</p>

		<p>Remember that it was the neoconservatives who drove Buchanan and anyone else with the slightest shred of white racial consciousness out of the GOP and mainstream conservatism.  If the GOP is ever going to be a vehicle to advance white interests, the neoconservatives and their allies will have to be purged from the party completely.  They are the main force on the political right that is opposed to white interests.  </p>

		<p>I honestly believe a populist could end up as GOP nominee,   though he/she would not be the ideal choice of the Republican establishment.  In 2008, Huckabee came within a hair of winning.  The powers that be sent Thompson to SC to tear him down, and Fred was seemingly successful in doing so, but it was very close.  And did the party big wigs want McCain?  Hardly, I think.  They would have much preferred Rudy or Romney, but primary voters thwarted their plans.  <br>
When Obama runs again, he will have the advantage of incumbency, and the Repubs will need a very popular candidate.  They&rsquo;re already trying to co-opt the Tea Party movement.  And if Scott Brown morphs into a typical Repub, he&rsquo;ll likely lose reelection in MA.  Chris Matthews and Buchanan both think he&rsquo;s a sure bet for Presidential contention.  <br>
Let&rsquo;s be plain about it.  Most white people want a Prez who will look to their concerns, which includes control over immigration  &mdash;  which both major parties now avoid like the plague.  But one of them must pick up this issue or face a third-party movement, and the GOP had better seize it to keep from splitting the conservative vote.    </p>

<p>You do make a valid point, about Brown being about as conservative as the &#8220;two ladies from Maine&#8221; (another PJB term). Here in Idaho, a Dem, Walt Minnick, won the last election after the incumbent GOP rep ran a totally incompetent campaign   &mdash;   yet, since this district is deep red, he votes just like a GOP congressman anyway, and doesn&rsquo;t dare do otherwise. In fact, I&rsquo;ve overheard liberal eggheads complain about him quite a bit.</p>

		<p>Huckabee is as far from being pro-white as you can get.  He supports open borders, white guilt and a neocon foreign policy.  </p>
<p>This new brand of pseudo-populist conservatism represented by people like Huckabee and Sarah Palin is not in any way, shape or form good for white people.  It&rsquo;s sad that so many people get suckered by this act.  </p>

		<p>Right now. Unfortunately, I do not see anyone that can defeat Obama in 2012. This new guy certainly cannot. Once the Democrats start going after his flip flopping on issues, traditional conservatives attack him for his support of affirmative action and gun control, and conservative evangelicals denounce his more secular views on abortion and his past as a nude model etc&hellip;. He will be badly damaged. He might even have trouble winning Massachusetts.</p>

		<p>Scott Brown is not very bright. I doubt he has any idea who elected him. He will drink the neo-con cool aid. Like most upper class New England whites, he has had little contact with blacks and probably has the usual delusions about them.</p>
<p>BTW, can anyone remember the last time a Republican has said anything about getting rid of quotas? The only thing I&rsquo;ve heard lately is Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor renewing her proclamation of another 25 yrs of them.</p>

		<p>It is way too early to consider BHO a one termer. However this guy Brown just maybe a start in the right direction. People have to realize this is the best we can do in a state like Mass. But there is no excuse for a Mc Cain from Arizona or a Graham from SC. The best feature about Brown is that he is a handsome, athletic looking, military man, much like the manly leader&rsquo;s that I remember from my long ago chilhood, not the broken down, moronic, effiminate wreck&rsquo;s we have been getting for all these year&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>On Scott Brown:</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s hardly our savior.  His politics are probably not even totally square with lamestream conservatives.  I would guess that he&rsquo;ll be somewhat more conservative than Olympia Snowe, but not as conservative as Jeff Sessions.  A Kit Bond/George Voinovich type.  However, this is Massachusetts we&rsquo;re talking about here   &mdash;   The best is the enemy of the good, and when you&rsquo;re an AmRenner, and thinking about that state, the best is even the enemy of the fair.</p>
<p>For sure, would I like a lot better?  Yes.  But we don&rsquo;t have that luxury now.  You have to admit, just because the very man some of you deride as a &#8220;nude centerfold&#8221; won an election, ObamaCare is pretty much toast   &mdash;   If there is an HCR bill passed this year, it&rsquo;ll be an expansion of existing Federal health care programs (which isn&rsquo;t entirely a bad thing), instead of a new nightmare bureaucracy and FBI agents taking you off to Federal prison to be raped every day for five years for not signing up for PelosiCare.  Cap-and-tax is DOA.  Brown is even against amnesty/CIR, and the pundits now say that it&rsquo;s DOA, too.  If 55,000 Massachusetts voters had changed their minds before voting, Coakley would have won, and it would have been full ObamaCare, Cap-and-Tax and Amnesty Ahead.  All we can do is slow liberalism down.  That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m glad he won, and would haven&rsquo;t given a second thought in voting for him if I lived in MA. </p>
<p>Now, for President, I am hoping that, if he runs, I have a few better options.  However, at the moment, assuming he does run for President in 2012, he is the least bad of many worse options that are talking about running on the Republican side.  Sarah Palin has been on the wrong side of the immigration issue thus far.</p>
<p>As for his vote for RomneyCare, which I&rsquo;m surprised the Democrats didn&rsquo;t bring up at all in the campaign, while RomneyCare has turned out to be a flop, I am willing to give a person a chance to live and learn.  I certainly make mistakes all the time, and I&rsquo;m not willing to believe that I&rsquo;ll ever really know it all, (even though I actually did as a teenager). </p>

<p>I have to respectfully disagree with you. While it will not be the sole issue of discomfort among religous and social conservatives, many of them will be disturbed by the fact that he engaged in this sort of behavior at all. This is hardly the behavior of a &#8220;family values&#8221; man. His age will be irrelevant to them.</p>
<p>In fact, several posters have made comments about him posing in his birthday suit.</p>
<p>Great White Observer:</p>
<p>The traits you mention - handsome, athletic looking, military man<br>
are useles if he turns out to be a (to use antoher posters term) &#8220;wishy washy&#8221; politician. As far as I am concerned, give the the frail, weak looking, possibly even effeminine type of White politican that is genuinely concerned about the future of our race and works to promote our rights over mantinee idle, marlboro man looking, race traitor men any day.  </p>

		<p>Obama never had White America in the first place.  I think what&rsquo;s really happened has to with schisms that have been forming in the Democratic Party between the pro-war and anti-war factions.  There is also another unrelated one between blacks and hispanics.  You have a Democrat Party that fancies itself the anti-war party, the majority party in both houses of Congress, in addition to a President who ran on an anti-war platform and yet placed neocons in his cabinet.  Is Obama really anti-war?  Well, the troops are still over there and they&rsquo;re staying there.  Go figure?  This should open a few people&rsquo;s eyes as to who is really controlling this government.  The real truth is no matter how the media is spinning it is that Obama has lost those anti-war White voters.  </p>

What we in this country have is a democratic fascist government, whereby the populace votes for the fascist of their choice.

<p>I&rsquo;m with you.  But never underestimate the superficiality of the average voter, even the average white voter.  You and I might want substance, but that&rsquo;s just us with our developed frontal lobes and all.  A recent UCLA study shows that most people vote their pocketbooks, and they formulate their permanent opinions about a politician only after one-tenth of a second of the first visual sight of him or her.  Anecdotal observations I have made of people I know have pretty much confirmed this.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m afraid the situation is FAR, FAR worse than Mr. Buchanan realizes (or is even capable of understanding). </p>
<p>Whites in America will not be &#8216;saved&rsquo; by conservatives, and the reason is not simply because the ranks of conservative organizations are filled almost entirely with dolts. The reasons are various, but perhaps the most important   &mdash;   and, paradoxically, the least discussed   &mdash;   is the disgusting state of White America itself. </p>
<p>As bad as the physical condition of the White population is, the MORAL condition is even worse. The fact that such a large share of the White population, of their own free will, cast their vote for Obama is clear evidence that the &#8216;ship&rsquo; is not even WORTH saving, regardless of whether it CAN be saved or not. One can talk all about the disgusting, unprecedented degree of partisanship by the mainstream media, but there can really be no excuse for purposefully selecting such a person. Outside of being compelled at gun point, I don&rsquo;t see how such a sad picture can lead to any other conclusion.</p>
<p>REMEMBER this: the essential thing that is happening to the West today is SPIRITUAL. The West is morally corrupt, plain and simple. And, unfortunately for conservatives, there will be no &#8216;clever trick&rsquo; that saves the day, no &#8216;backdoor route&rsquo; that allows the comfortable, decadent White population to preserve their race but also maintain their current diet of TV and trendy Hollywood films at the same time. </p>
<p>The only thing that will really &#8216;save&rsquo; the West will be a complete revolution   &mdash;   not just in the upper-level political ranks, but throughout the entire society at every level. This may seem &#8216;radical&rsquo; for conservatives, but the preservation of the West calls for nothing less&hellip;</p>

		<p>We must remember that in 2008, even with the economy in a tail-spin, a disastorous Bush neocon legacy and John McCain, one of the most pathetic candidates in recent memory, Obama was still only able to get 51% of the vote.  Fortunately for BHO, his biggest asset is the fact that Republicans never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.  My prediction is that in 2012 they will pick a presidential candidate who is pro-open borders, pro-bailouts and pro-foreign entanglements, an almost carbon copy of Obama.  Only until the white population stops supporting these counterfeit conservatives will the party begin to wake up.</p>

		<p>Joe Kennedy was the better conservative candidate but I submit this: Scott Brown will vote party-line to kill the gov&rsquo;t takeover of healthcare, which is his only function.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to Ron Paul by an amren poster and he is the ONLY candidate who has a history of voting who can save America. He is not pro-white nationalism but he is pro free-market and competition. In America, true free-market economics will kill minorities. My only problem with Ron Paul: he is supportive of changing immigration law to allow expanding guest worker programs. I do feel confident that he WOULD secure the borders though and I don&rsquo;t feel any other current heir-apparent Republican would.</p>
<p>#16 &amp; 24- ATBOTL- I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with you about Huckabee. He had been catering the Hispanic vote since he became Governor and it was sickening to here him try to distance himself from his pro-illegal stance in 2008. You are also right about Palin and the neo-con agenda. You sound like a Campaign for Liberty member&hellip;</p>

		<p> If the election of Scott Brown shows anything, it is that white people feel a general sense of unease about where the country is heading. Most white people are aware that their standard of living is declining and the ethnic composition of their country is changing. They distrust big government and fear for the future. The vote for Scott Brown was a protest vote not a vote for Republicanism.  Unfortunately, the Republican Party, with a few exceptions, supports the multicultural agenda, big government, and pro-immigration policies of the Democrats.</p>
