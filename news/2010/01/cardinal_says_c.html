			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Simon Caldwell, London Telegraph, January 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A leading Catholic cardinal has said Europeans only have themselves to blame for allowing Islam to &#8220;conquer&#8221; the continent.</p>
<p>Czech Cardinal Miloslav Vlk, the Archbishop of Prague, said Muslims were well placed to fill the spiritual void &#8220;created as Europeans systematically empty the Christian content of their lives&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Europe will pay dear for having left its spiritual foundations and that this is the last period that will not continue for decades when it may still have a chance to do something about it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Muslims definitely have many reasons to be heading here. They also have a religious one  &mdash;  to bring the spiritual values of faith in God to the pagan environment of Europe, to its atheistic style of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless the Christians wake up, life may be Islamised and Christianity will not have the strength to imprint its character on the life of people, not to say society.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 77-year-old cardinal made his remarks in an interview to mark his retirement after spending 19 years as the leader of the Czech Church.</p>
<p>He said he did not blame Muslims for the crisis as Europeans had brought it upon themselves by exchanging their Christian culture for an aggressive secularism that embraced atheism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Europe has denied its Christian roots from which it has risen and which could give it the strength to fend off the danger that it will be conquered by Muslims, which is actually happening gradually,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the Middle Ages and in the early modern age, Islam failed to conquer Europe with arms. The Christians beat them then.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, when the fighting is done with spiritual weapons which Europe lacks while Muslims are perfectly armed, the fall of Europe is looming.&#8221;</p>
<p>He called on Christians to respond to the threat of Islamisation by living their own religious faith more observantly.</p>
<p>Last year Cardinal Jose Policarpo, the Patriarch of Lisbon, warned Catholic women against marrying Muslims.</p>
<p>Italian Cardinal Giacomo Biffi also urged the Italian government to give priority to Catholic migrants over Muslims in order to protect his country&rsquo;s religious identity.</p>
<p>The Vatican has also opposed Turkey joining the European Union partly because the Muslim country does not share the continent&rsquo;s Christian heritage.<br>

		<p>It is good to hear a representative of Christianity warning against the islamization of Europe. However, the main reason why Europe is being islamized is not primarily because Europeans are &#8220;exchanging their Christian culture for an aggressive secularism that embraced atheism.&#8221;, but because European politicians allowed the massive immigration of Muslims into the continent and because the birth rate of native Europeans has become low. Retrieving Christianity won&rsquo;t solve Europe&rsquo;s Islam problem; only the stop of immigration and repatriation will in the long-run.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m no real fan of the Catholic church as a whole, but at least they will stand publicly for some type of traditional western values.  They hit the nail right on the head here.  The vast majority of our people will deserve what they have coming if they don&rsquo;t change their heathen ways.</p>

		<p>There is a big difference between the two religions in terms of government support. The leading Christian countries are offically neutral on religion. The leading Muslim countries are officially Islamic. Muslims, both in their own countries and in Western countries, are supported by governments. Christians have to do it all on their own and in many ways, such as the war on Christmas or school prayer, it is considered progress to de-Christianize society.  </p>

		<p>The only religion that supports nationalism is Christian Orthodox, most of Eastern Europe is Orthodox, maybe we have the best chance to survive in the long run.</p>
<p>I bet if you would listen to Orthodox priests, you would really like it, they are like they used to be hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>Orthodoxy is all about nationalism, at least this is how I see it.<br>

		<p>Europe is being overrun with Muslims as punishment for turning their backs on Christ, and embracing secular, and even perverted, lifestyles, that go against our Western traditions, and Christian Faith. </p>
<p>This secularism took hold after World War II, and also saw growth of the Communist Party in France, Italy, Greece, Spain, and other very Religious, and staunchly Catholic or Orthodox Christian Countries, prior to the War. </p>
<p>The Spanish Civil War was a Campaign to drive Communism completely out of Spain.</p>
<p>Likewise, The Netherlands, Britain, and Scandanavia were centers for open drug use, Homosexual lifestyles, Prostitution, and Sex Change operations. </p>
<p>Can anyone doubt that GOD is punishing HIS people for disobeying HIS laws, by using HIS enemies, and ours, to destroy us? Only a true return to Faith will rid Europe, and the White Race, of this scourge.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;d have to respectfully disagree.<br>
True politicians allow it to happen.<br>
but&hellip;<br>
The root of the problem lies in the education system which of course is controlled by the Liberal establishment.<br>
So long as society is &#8220;educated&#8221; from kindergarten all the way through college to hate white culture guess what happens?<br>
answer:<br>
You end up with a society that votes for politicians to make the country commit cultural suicide.</p>

		<p>We do not fight Islam with spiritual weapons. His Emminence Cardinal Vlk should visit our forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Every victory gained by the west against Islam, or any non-western force, was gained by superior western force. </p>
<p>Our presnt crisis is not spiritual, it is physical. The west lacks a future because western men will NOT be men! Our women sense this, and hence have contempt for us. That accounts for dismal fertility. Women will not bear children for men who have nothing of the bear in them. Cardinal Policarpo is closer to the right track, telling Catholic women to stay  &mdash;  not stray.</p>

		<p>religion is a part of community. </p>
<p>christianity is integral to the heritage of european civilization, not a detachable component.</p>
<p>as europeans rediscover their own culture in the wake of the gigantic trainwreck that is multiculturalism, christian culture will be rediscovered too.</p>
<p>a healthy society does not invite in its disposessors, and the muslim &#8220;invasion&#8221; is only metaphorically an invasion, because they were invited in, given free housing &amp; food &amp; health care &amp; education, and told that anything the natives do to offend them would be criminalized.</p>
<p>considering the dyfunctional tribal hellholes most of these people come from, a hard deal to turn down.</p>
<p>the latest muslim &#8220;invasion&#8221; of europe was actually an open invitation, and the main proponents were ONE) the moneyed elite, who are afraid that shrinking populations will mean negative economic growth, and TWO) the psychotic left, who would like to see european civilization erased.</p>
<p>caught between the two psychotic and criminal entities are ordinary working people, who would cheerfully saw off their left arms with butter knifes to restore europe to the way it was 25 years ago.</p>

		<p>It gets my gander hearing these religious leaders always blaming  Christians for not filling the churches. Other then what some of these &#8216;new progressive church leaders&rsquo; have become  to cause much of the disilusionment,the churches have fallen  into decay and ruin because of the states often deliberate intentions of flooding specific  areas  with immigrants consisting of  malevolent Muslims and bellicoste tribes of Africans with the predictable  outcome that many Christians and/oe Whites will sell up and  move out very quickly and  hence with them the flock which once filled the churches in the first place.</p>
<p> Ethnic cleansing in fact. A bloodless genocide. </p>
<p>On you tube btw  is  video of Manchester (Marxist Run) Council allowing demolition of a church and Christian burial ground so in its place a mosque  can be erected. </p>

As an Atheist and also a Race Realist, I call on Europeans to respond to the threat of Islamisation by KICKING OUT THE MUSLIMS and living by their own race/culture/civilization more observantly.</p>

		<p>In Holland a vote for the Christian Democrats is a vote for Islam and I think this is true across europe.  They seem to prefer any theology over secularism. Looks like we are going to go from not being able to buy beer on Sunday to not being able to buy beer at all.  Thanks guys.</p>

		<p>conservative-Gen Xer,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to respectfully agree that the controlled, self-hate-inflicting education of whites is the original cause of them voting for politicians who brought in the Muslims and other unassimilable immigrants into our lands. This caused the symptom of islamization, to which I refered to without mentioning it explicitly.<br>
However, I don&rsquo;t see how reembracing Christanity would solve either the cause or the symptoms. Religion and race (or ethnicity) are two different things. Unfortunately, it is the many churches and Christian leaders who call upon welcoming non-white immigrants (Muslims included) on behalf of Christian tolerance and charity. It is some churches who allowed themselves to be converted into mosques without resistance. Any parties and leaders who vow to kick out unassimilable immigrants or halt immigration are condemned by representatives of Christianity on a regular basis. All they care about is religion in the best case (for why they don&rsquo;t oppose the immigration of Christians in general, regardless of whether they are white or non-white) and they don&rsquo;t seem to be concerned about the preservation of the racial/ethnic integrity of the country. It looks like liberalism has transformed Christanity into a common alignment, thus I can&rsquo;t see how Christianity is able to get rid of its liberal elements by itself.</p>

		<p>Did you notice that it wasn&rsquo;t a French cardinal or a German cardinal or a Spnaish cardianl or an irish cardinal that braved these words?  Of course not.  Those tend to be pansy-like when it comes to defending their people, their lands, or their beliefs.  The Slavs are a different breed.  They have spines of steel and the will to fight.  And, a very good fight they will give I might add!</p>

		<p>I beg to differ with the cardinal.  At one time Christianity was a militant, intolerant and fighting faith.  Now, it is an effete religion and many of its followers spineless and cowardly in the extreme.  Contemporary Christianity isn&rsquo;t a bulwark against anything that ails Western Civilization and it forfeited its role as our protector long ago.</p>
<p>When the Catholic Pope champions the cause of illegal Mexicans to invade the U.S. then I fail to see how Catholicism/Christianity is the white man&rsquo;s ally.  The raceless, cosmopolitan, &#8220;turn the other cheek&#8221; message that it preaches is quickly leading to our demise.      </p>
