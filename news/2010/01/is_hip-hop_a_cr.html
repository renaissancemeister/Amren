<h1><a href="https://rawstory.com/2010/01/army-imprisoned-soldier-violent-hiphop/">Is Hip-Hop A Crime? Army Imprisoned Soldier Over Lyrical &#8216;Threats&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen C. Webster,* The Raw Story, January 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The United States Army certainly believes it can be, and that&rsquo;s just what landed Spc. Marc Hall, of Fort Stewart, Georgia, behind bars on December 11, 2009.</p>
<p>The Army&rsquo;s reason: Hall&rsquo;s track &#8220;Stop Loss&#8221; was determined to contain &#8220;threats&#8221; against fellow soldiers.</p>
<p>Under the name &#8220;Marc Watercus,&#8221; Hall rhymed:<blockquote>Like Obama says somebody be held responsible<br>
But some of you all gonna be held in the hospitals, whenever possible<br>
I&rsquo;m gonna round up all eventually, easily, walk right up peacefully<br>
And surprise them all<br>
Yes, yes y&rsquo;all, up against the wall, turn around<br>
I got a m*****f****** magazine with 30 rounds, on a three round burst<br>
Ready to fire down, spray and watch the bodies all hit the floor<br>
I bet you don&rsquo;t stop-loss nobody no more,<br>
in your next lifetime of course<br>
</blockquote>Hall is in an Arlington, Virginia jail after being charged with a violation of Article 134, which governs &#8220;all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces, and crimes and offenses not capital,&#8221; according to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another count accuses him of distributing &#8216;original songs wrongfully threatening acts of violence against members of his unit,&rsquo;&#8221; military publication Stars and Stripes added. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Hall planned to leave the military at the end of his contract on February 27, before his commander, Captain Cross at Fort Stewart, moved to have him incarcerated for the song,&#8221; Dahr Jamail wrote on the political blog t r u t h o u t. &#8220;The military currently intends to keep Hall in pre-trial confinement until he is court-martialed, which is expected to be several months from now.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Klimaski [James Klimaski, Hall&rsquo;s attorney] also claimed his client &#8220;[understands] the Army&rsquo;s concerns, particularly in light of the shooting at Fort Hood in November, but stressed [Hall] was merely exercising his right to freedom of speech,&#8221; according to Georgia newspaper The Coastal Courrier.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hall and his supporters have raised a Web site to promote his advocacy against the stop-loss policy [&#8220;the involuntary extension of a service member&rsquo;s active duty service under the enlistment contract in order to retain them beyond their initial end of term of service (ETS) date&#8221;   &mdash;  Wikipedia]. AWOL soldier support group Courage to Resist is raising funds for Hall&rsquo;s legal defense and activist group Iraq Veterans Against the War is also urging its members to support Hall with calls and letters of protest against his imprisonment.</p>

		<p>I think these kinds of threats have been going on for a long time, especially black on white.  But now, the Armed Forces is taking it seriously after Fort Hood.  </p>
<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t already know, there is a link on the right side of this very webpage, entitled &#8220;Kill Whitey, Lethal Garbage:  Anti-White Rap Lyrics.&#8221;  It will make the hair on your head stand straight up.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right about that #1, I work with the military here in the middle east and the military appears to be 50-60% black in any unit with which I have worked, notwithstanding SF and SOU/Gs (and I&rsquo;ve worked with many in 6 years) and they all appear to have brought the ghetto and that sort of &#8220;music&#8221; with them. Any white commander that makes a move against the protected species, we all know that it could be, and most likely WOULD be, a career ending decision. My hats&rsquo; off and a sharp salute to the commander who brought charges against the &#8220;man&#8221; and I hope he isn&rsquo;t vilified for it though I KNOW &#8220;racisssss&#8221; charges will be brought up if not actually filed.</p>

<p>Thank you Comrade Hall, for that bracing dose of bitter and barbaric contempt!</p>
<p>Once, at a carnival in Windsor, Ontario, I noticed that they fast-forwarded over this on display portion of Pink Floyd&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Wall:&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, why might that be?</p>
<p>Moreover, we must accept that if we ever disrupt our multicultural enemies&rsquo; plans, we must never stop, even for a second, moving from disruption toward their deserved destruction!</p>

		<p>Hip-hop is for people who are incapable of hearing melody or harmony; all these folks can hear is pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse.  I would LOVE to incarcerate every little wannabe gang banger who drives down the street at 2 in the morning with the &#8220;boom, boom   &mdash;   ta boom&#8221; playing at FULL VOLUME.  As soon as you hear that garbage you know it&rsquo;s being played by a young, ill educated, dropout, unemployed, victim/entitlement consciousness &#8220;person&#8221; (I use the term loosely)&hellip;.  So they put this Army guy away?  Good.  The lyrics these creeps get away with are in fact criminal.  Loser &#8216;music,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s all it is.</p>

		<p>Guilty! A suggestion to all soldiers. After the fort hood massacre, talk softly and hold in your anger. Otherwise they will come for you, especially if you are a non-moslem. </p>

		<p>When one enlists in the armed forces, some of one&rsquo;s rights go away or are attenuated, and one of those is freedom of speech.  If Hall had waited until his February 27 out-date to publish this &#8220;music&#8221;, he would have been completely free to do so, and not subject to any punishment from the army (because he would be a civilian again) or civilian authorities (because his full constitutional rights would have returned.)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which is the more glaring flaw in Hall; the contempt for fellow service members he expressed in these lyrics, or the gross stupidity in publishing them before he had safely exited the military.  If he gets a dishonorable discharge, this will count exactly the same on his record as a felony conviction.</p>

		<p>Notice the obfuscation in the headline.  It&rsquo;s just an innocent little music lyric, NBD.  But Toby Keith&rsquo;s &#8220;Courtesy of the Red White and Blue&#8221; is evil hate music part of a vast right wing conspiracy, don&rsquo;t ya know   &mdash;   Send Morris Dees a bag of money.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s going to get any serious time for these lyrics.  The most likely punishment is that he will finish his enlistment in the stockade, and be booted out on February 27 with either a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge.  Whether he wrote the lyrics before or after the Ft. Hood massacre will probably help determine which of those discharges he receives.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m relieved that the armed forces are not taking the chances they were before the Ft. Hood massacre; they ignored repeated indications that the shooter there was very unstable.</p>
