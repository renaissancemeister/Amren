<h1><a href="https://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/01/09/bill-clinton-to-teddy-kennedy-in-new-campaign-book-obama-should/">New Campaign Book: Bill Clinton&rsquo;s Remark About Obama Angered Teddy Kennedy</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carl M. Cannon, Politics Daily, January 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The forceful 2008 endorsement of Barack Obama by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy  &mdash;  and Kennedy&rsquo;s sudden break with the Clintons  &mdash;  was caused in part by a racist comment made by Bill Clinton to Kennedy over the telephone, according to a new campaign book.</p>
<p>The book, Game Change, by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, asserts on page 218 that after Obama won the Iowa caucuses, Clinton called Kennedy to press for an endorsement from the influential Massachusetts liberal. But the call backfired, according to the authors, and left Kennedy deeply offended.</p>
<p>The day after Iowa, he phoned Kennedy and pressed for an endorsement, making the case for his wife. But Bill then went on, belittling Obama in a manner that deeply offended Kennedy. Recounting the conversation later to a friend, Teddy fumed that Clinton had said, A few years ago, this guy would have been getting us coffee.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton, once lauded by African-American admirers as the &#8220;first black president,&#8221; got in trouble later in the campaign when he came across as dismissive of Obama&rsquo;s South Carolina victory by noting that Jesse Jackson had also carried the state when he ran in 1988. But this is the first time the &#8220;coffee&#8221; remark has been reported, and it is likely to reopen all old wounds  &mdash;  and cause some new ones.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the Halperin/Heilemann book, however, this remark was not an isolated instance. On Page 161 Hillary Clinton is depicted as being tickled when her New Hampshire campaign chairman Bill Shaheen mentions Obama&rsquo;s use of drugs as a young man. &#8220;Good for him,&#8221; Hillary is quoted as saying. &#8220;Let&rsquo;s push it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sounds like one of those comments designed to make us feel sympathy for the &#8216;plight&rsquo; of African Americans. Liberals especially make these kind of comments. It&rsquo;s just the kind of thing we&rsquo;ve come to expect from someone like Bill Clinton, too. He&rsquo;s about the right demographic for it. When he&rsquo;s not praising Moscow. Sometimes in our own day and age liberals can be punished for this. Who says there&rsquo;s no justice in the world? </p>

		<p>Komrade Klinton?  Amazing.  The old adage is obviously true   &mdash;   there&rsquo;s some good in everyone, no matter how unlikely.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we&rsquo;re apparently supposed to feel horror that Hillary actually had the gall to run a legitimate campaign against the Mulatto Messiah.</p>
<p>The only thing at all remarkable about this article is that it was considered important enough by the governmedia to print it at all.  The Klintons   &mdash;   who have plenty of legitimate crimes on their tarnished souls   &mdash;   are essentially being accused of nothing more substantial than heresy. </p>
<p> It seems that disapproving of the Messiah is even taboo for the most pathetic of the marxist rabble.  It is, at least, amusing to watch them being forced to eat their own dog food.<br>

<p>Laughably, as I have observed in the past, Comrade Hillary was probably the &ldquo;best&rdquo; chance this country had at &ldquo;stability,&rdquo; once Comrade McCain had secured the Republican nomination. Moreover, it is unfortunate that both Comrades Billy and Hillary are only &ldquo;reverse Nixon&rdquo; political strategists and not really on our side. Had they both been vindictive &ldquo;reverse Nixon&rdquo; policy pragmatists, they might be back in the White House now; and with a US Senate puppet Comrade BO, mindlessly reading their dictates ever so &ldquo;comfortingly&rdquo; through teleprompters that they almost exclusively controlled.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they really do believe in their religion of multiculturalism and never seem to fully grasp how this has hurt them. </p>

		<p> When I first heard about the &#8220;getting us coffee&#8221; comment by Bill Clinton, I automatically took it as his praise of &#8220;racial progress&#8221;   &mdash;   not as a &#8220;racist&#8221; slam at Obama. If that&rsquo;s the main reason Ted Kennedy endorsed Obama over Hillary Clinton, it was a very poor one and showed bad judgment on his part. The brain cancer already interfering with his thought processes, perhaps.</p>
<p> It will be interesting to see what &#8220;Mr. Bill&#8221; has to say about his alleged remark. Bet he won&rsquo;t let it go unanswered.</p>

		<p>I am not a fan of the Clintons, but I think this might be a case of selling a book.  I mean Kennedy is dead, and so it is easy to attribute charges from Kennedy towards Clinton.</p>
<p>As for Hillary&rsquo;s remark, what do they expect?  If reports surface about hard drug use by Obama, why wouldn&rsquo;t an opponent (in this case Hillary) push it?  </p>
<p>Unless, Obamam is suppose to get preferential treatment, even by his opponents?</p>
<p>It is amusing watching liberals turn on each other, fight, and play the race card on each other.</p>

		<p>President Clinton is two-faced on quasi-racial issues in another way   &mdash;   Late in his 2nd term, he came out against Confederate Battle Flags on public property.  While he was Governor of Arkansas, he signed Confederate Flag Day for the state.</p>
<p>I think the reason Ted Kennedy endorsed Obama over HRC early in the primaries is that the Kennedy&rsquo;s fashion themselves as the premier family within the Democrat Party.  In spite of that, only one Kennedy was actually President, and not even for three years.  If HRC would have won the White House, or even as much as the nomination, the Clintons would have become instantly more prominent within the party than the Kennedys.  It was all Kennedy self-preservation.</p>

<p>is it possible that what Bill Clinton meant, was that Barack Obama was not a very good candidate, int the first place. That the man didn&rsquo;t do much aside from soeaking about hope and unity, etc, etc, but actually had very few good ideas on how to solve America&rsquo;s problems?</p>
<p>The way I see it, Hillary had everything to become the first woman president of the United States, but suddenly this Black guy of little acomplishment, and with very little experience, came out of nowhere; and thanks to some well-written speeches (by David Axelrod) and the fact that he was a young, good-looking candidate, more or less stole what should have been Hillary&rsquo;s presidency.</p>
<p>I think the Democrats who elected him should seriously ask themselves why they chose a Black man who,s all image, devoid of substance, over a Hillary Clinton.</p>

I wonder what Ted Kennedy said about black Americans in his many inebriated moments. I doubt it was &#8220;the dream shall never die&#8221;.

They bought the black vote in big cities by promising to file lawsuits against banks that refused to lend money to certain minorities that invest in malt liquor, rock cocaine and prison tattoos. </p>

		<p>And like with Reid, Clinton was speaking truthfully. The metaphor about getting coffee speaks to credentials and experience, not servile behavior.</p>
<p>I do find it odd that a man who was an unknown State Senator from IL. could go to the Presidency in four years, and began running only after two years in the Senate, and do so well.</p>
<p>I hate to think the fix, as orchestrated by Ted was in the works, but I must conclude it was and is so.</p>

<p>Thank you for noticing that.  I&rsquo;ve always contended that Obama is an empty suit, as a front for the evil genius of Axelrod, Rahm and Valerie Jarrett.  When Axelrod came to prominence with every Obama primary and caucus win in early 2008, the media told us that he managed John Edwards&rsquo;s campaign for President in 2004, and Deval Patrick&rsquo;s for Governor of Massachusetts in 2006.  My response was this:  So, this is Axelrod&rsquo;s hustle?  He writes a speech full of hope change hope change, and every two years he finds some sucker to read it in public.  And it evidently works   &mdash;   John Edwards didn&rsquo;t get the nomination in 2004, but John Kerry did choose him as his running mate.  And obviously both Patrick and Obama won.  So call Edwards a half a win, and Axelrod is 2.5 for 3, which is an 0.833 batting average.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re welcome. I think that it&rsquo;s obvious that Barack owes his presidency to the people behind him, to those who are pulling the strings&hellip; and to his teleprompter!</p>
<p>Yes, his teleprompter; when he has to answer questions, rather than read a speech written for him, using that machine, it becomes so obvious that he is nothing like the great orator people think he is&hellip;</p>
<p>So yes, it&rsquo;s Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod who made the Mulatto Messiah president. And it&rsquo;s pretty much like they are running things, now. I don&rsquo;t think Handsome Barack really decides many things&hellip;</p>
