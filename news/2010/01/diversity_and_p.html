<h1>Diversity and Perversity</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marian Evans, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> January 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On January 6, President Obama appointed Amanda Simpson, 49, as a senior technical advisor in the Commerce Department&rsquo;s Bureau of Industry and Security, where she will monitor weapons export technology. Until about 10 years ago, Amanda Simpson was a man  &mdash;  Michael Simpson  &mdash;  but she spent about six years &#8220;transitioning&#8221; to Amanda. She has worked in defense industries for nearly 30 years and in her Michael days was even a test pilot at Hughes Aircraft for executive jets. The now Miss Simpson, a former board member of the National Center for Transgender Equality and a current board member of an organization called Out and Equal, is very much an activist for trasnssexuals. She recognized the symbolic importance of her presidential appointment as a transsexual, saying, &#8220;I hope that I will soon be one of hundreds and that this appointment opens future opportunities for many others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the details of Miss Simpson&rsquo;s &#8220;transition&#8221; are not public, a complete male-to-female sex change involves surgical removal of the testicles, construction of an artificial vagina using penis tissue, breast augmentation, hormone treatments, laser removal of body hair, and &#8220;feminization&#8221; of the face through plastic surgery. Most Americans can be forgiven for thinking that this is a startling, even shocking price to pay for sexual fulfillment. If such a radical, unnatural procedure, which also eliminates any possibility of reproduction cannot be called perversion, the word has no meaning. Moreover, one would not ordinarily expect someone who was driven to go through such a &#8220;transition&#8221; to be a balanced, reliable person in whom national trust should be placed. This process should hardly be highlighted or encouraged through the attention that comes through presidential appointments.</p>
<p>It is true that the human mammal goes to great lengths in search of sexual fulfillment. In 2008, Eliot Spitzer resigned as governor of New York when it was discovered that over the years he had spent an estimated $80,000 on $1,000-an-hour call girls. It would not be clear to most Americans why this was unforgivable if Miss Simpson&rsquo;s exertions are laudable. </p>
<p>However, what strikes us about this appointment is this: Miss Simpson  &mdash;  artificial vagina and all  &mdash;  has apparently sailed through the appointment process, and looks forward to the day when hundreds like her have positions of political power. We can be sure that she would never have been appointed if she had ever said she liked being white, that she wanted her grandchildren to be white, and that she hoped her descendants would live in a nation with a white majority. </p>
<p>It would be hard to think of a more striking example of how the abnormal has become normal and the normal abnormal.</p>

		<p>If I decided one day to eat lots of rice, get certified in accounting, and surgically alter my facial features, it wouldn&rsquo;t make me Asian. Similarly, taking hormones and getting surgery to mimic the most obvious female characteristics don&rsquo;t make you a woman.</p>

		<p>The messiah despises whites and the America created by whites so much his greatest desire is to &#8220;fundementally transform America, as we know it,&#8221; as he explained in his own words dozens of times.</p>
<p>I made note of that at the time.  Did you?</p>
<p>His loathing is so great he appoints white-hating people to posts, like Sotomayor, Van Jones, Mark Lloyd, Valerie Jarret, etc., which is his way of thumbing his nose at all of us, while his main pursuits involve giving more wealth and power to blacks via outrageous bills like healthcare, cap and trade, etc. </p>
<p>This community organizer, as I wrote BEFORE he was elected, wanted to be president in order to pursue the same black agenda he was involved with for over twenty years with his friend and mentor Jeremiah Wright, and his idol, Saul Alinsky. </p>
<p>Well, he was elected and he&rsquo;s pursuing exactly what should have been obvious to everyone at the time, but it wasn&rsquo;t.  But, to many it&rsquo;s not obvious right now even after he has given us numerous examples of his pro-black agenda.</p>
<p>Many different negative factors are converging on this man right now all at once, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he were forced out of office, although I realize the chances of that are slim.</p>
<p>However, the over riding impression I get from his attitude and the agenda he is following is that he doesn&rsquo;t care if he gets re-elected in 2012 or not&hellip;if he makes it that far&hellip;so long as he can &#8220;fundementally change the system,&#8221; in the amount of time he serves in his first term.</p>
<p>Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and John McCain&hellip;plus many others&hellip;. have all stated that Obama wants to collapse the system in a Cloward-Piven maneuver that will allow him and his pro-black friends to build another&hellip;more to his liking&hellip;.from the ground up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I agree that he wants to collapse the systen, but there&rsquo;s no doubt that he&rsquo;s going to do everything in his power to change things so that blacks have more power and wealth than they do now.  But, don&rsquo;t worry.  Any position of wealth or power they get&hellip;.no matter how extensive&hellip;. will be bungled by them, and they&rsquo;ll return to their position at the bottom of society&rsquo;s  totem pole.  These people are born losers.  Nothing will EVER change that.</p>

		<p>Amanda Simpson may look female on the outside, but its XY chromosomes proclaim it to be a male. It is no more female than Chastity Bono, now undergoing a sex change operation into male as &#8220;Chaz Bono&#8221;, is a male.</p>

		<p>Why worry about his/her previous gender?  She&rsquo;s White.  The origin of &#8220;poltical correctness&#8221; was &#8220;Critical Theory&#8221; which sought to substitute tensions based around gender, homosexuality, sex, ethnicticity for the class tensions that was not promoting social revolution.  Effectively gays and women are promoted an ideology of victimisation and coopted into helping the pro-immigration movement that is seeking to minoritise Whites and tax us to death to support their affirmitive action programs.   Critical theory seemingly worked!</p>
<p>By pointlessly railing aginst gays or transgenders we drive these people into the the arms of our opponents.  Whether nature or nurture such people will always exist.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be best if they&rsquo;re on our side or at least not compelled to activism against us?  We need not promote but we can remain neutral even if at a personal level it &#8216;creeps us out&rsquo;.   One of the most effective anti-immigration activists was Pym Furtuyn of Holland and he was openly gay.</p>

		<p>I have to wholeheartedly disagree with the author.<br>
Gay folks don&rsquo;t wish to be gay, they ARE gay.<br>
People don&rsquo;t go through such intense, (horrible) surgery on some whim, or for &#8220;sexual fulfillment,&#8221; as the idiotic author states.<br>
Like it or not, homosexuality is a fact of nature. Anyone who has the sense to think of their childhood, can remember numerous classmates, boys and girls, who were gay as can be, without any socialization to encourage it. Later on, they grew up to be-surprise!&hellip;gay. Duh.<br>
I sometimes get impatient with gays, and I really tire of the whole super-butch lesbian thing, or the ultra-effeminate gay guy theme, because it&rsquo;s so gauche, so lame. (Can&rsquo;t they just act normal, and gay?)<br>
 But for the most part I know they are in a hell of a pickle, born to one gender, but oriented psychologically and biologically-to varying degrees- to the opposite gender. I&rsquo;d NEVER want to take on their burden.<br>
Plus, I don&rsquo;t begrudge them their right to live as they see fit, because it&rsquo;s their life, not mine. They have a natural right to live their private lives as they see fit, though I draw the line at adoption, because I think it would burden kids unfairly, for the selfish fulfillment of a gay couple. And no, I&rsquo;m not a libertarian. I&rsquo;m even a Christian. <br>
I just can&rsquo;t deny the obvious. It&rsquo;s as obvious as the plain fact that the third world is a largely backward, hellish place with largely less intelligent and compotent people, than in the West. <br>
Just common sense. Centuries of performance prove it beyond any reasonable doubt. <br>
Science fairly screams the obvious facts of racial difference, but they are supressed. Science also hints strongly at real differences between gays and straights, though, curiously, such facts are well received by some gays&hellip;odd. <br>
The truth is plain, but not always easy to accept. Race realists should not fall prey to the same sort of fuzzy logic and emotional decision making that marxists, multicults and liberals do.<br>
Just as real and very important racial differences exist (Am Renners seem to be on a mission to open the stupid world&rsquo;s eyes to the fact), Gayness is real, biological, and it isn&rsquo;t going away.<br>
Wake up.</p>

<p>I agree with very much of what you say, and what you have to say is more important than what I&rsquo;m about to say&hellip; but in the end you&rsquo;re position is similar to the &#8216;PC&rsquo; position: &#8216;Race is a social construct, but Gayness is real, biological, and isn&rsquo;t going away&rsquo;. Frankly I don&rsquo;t believe it. Seems backwards to me. Everything is backwards, isn&rsquo;t it? </p>

		<p>Commenting on a recent article dealing with the transgender issue, posted on AR (12/22/09) &ldquo;Cheerless: The Real Reason Lincoln High No Longer Has Spirit,&rdquo;  I noted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have worked in a variety of clinical settings (from hospitals to prisons, to be exact) and I will tell you from over 12 years of experience, that it is rather rare to meet an individual that has undergone the full surgery/gender &ldquo;reassignment&rdquo; and is satisfied with the outcome. It does happen, but less frequently then you might think; &lsquo;sexual minorities&rsquo; of questionably stability are often allowed this &lsquo;ordered complex surgery,&rsquo; without the proper controls and screenings of the past. Thus, a disordered personality with sexual confusion that has been mutilated, is the result about 90% of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>See this AR link:</p>
<p><a href="/news/2009/12/cheerless_the_r.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2009/12/cheerless_the_r.php</a></p>
<p>This was in response to being denounced as &ldquo;sick&rdquo; and &ldquo;hateful,&rdquo; by some drive-by entity calling itself &ldquo;Foo.&rdquo; My crime was pointing out that this surgery has become far too commonplace and that often a homosexual with borderline personality traits, is granted it without any attempt to have them simply accept their sexual orientation and reject the surgery option. My point being that homosexuality and gender identity are two different circumstances and should not be confused with each other. If they are, the results are often unfortunate and unpleasant for the mistakenly categorized individual.</p>
<p>This is where the situation of Comrade Amanda Simpson becomes complicated; if the surgery was in response to true transgender issues and she is comfortable with what has been done, no problem. However, if Comrade Simpson remains psychologically conflicted and grappling with &ldquo;her&rdquo; sexuality and its relation to &ldquo;her&rdquo; former gender, that changes everything. </p>
<p>I cannot judge such things from this distance; however, I can say with some confidence, that this line of questioning should have been a component of the confirmation process. It evidently was not, as the author notes: &ldquo;&hellip;Miss Simpson &mdash; artificial vagina and all &mdash; has apparently sailed through the appointment process&hellip;&rdquo; If such a line of questioning had been taken, there would have been the typical Marxstream Media circus of outrage and accusations, that always follows from a reasonable questioning of their multicultural and here multi-sexual dogmas. </p>
<p>Given the sensitive and critical nature of the appointment, this is most unfortunate to say the very least.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t find this article cohesive in making any single point, but it does raise a few questions.  </p>
<p>If this person hadn&rsquo;t been transsexual, would she have gotten this appointment? </p>
<p>Her statement that she hoped she would be &#8216;one of hundreds&rsquo; was bizarre:  how many transsexuals are there, and how many appointments are available? </p>

		<p>There was an episode on the funny, perverted TV show South Park, which I watch regularly, in which gender dysphoria was made to look stupid.</p>
<p>In the episode, one of the boys wants to be a basketball player. He says that he feels black on the inside because he listens to hip hop music. He visits a cosmetic surgeon who makes his skin black and his legs taller. Even funnier is when the boy&rsquo;s dad gets cosmetic surgery to make him look like a dolphin, thinking that he was born a dolphin on the inside.</p>
<p>Disaster ensues at the end of the episode, and the cosmetic surgeon makes everyone normal again &mdash; except for the very regretful &#8220;woman&#8221; who was given a permanent sex change.</p>
<p>The point of the episode was trying to make was that you&rsquo;re basically born as you&rsquo;re born, even if you feel differently on the inside.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t buy into gender dysphoria. If you&rsquo;re born as a man, you&rsquo;re a man. If you&rsquo;re born as a woman, you&rsquo;re a woman. Feeling otherwise doesn&rsquo;t change anything.</p>

<p>Good points. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how this is inherently a racial issue. Obviously the victim ideology you point out is anti-white but it&rsquo;s possible to be genuinely tolerant without descending into insanity. </p>
<p>Sexual reassignment surgery is legal and even subsidized by the state in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Not that I have any affection for that regime, but I&rsquo;ll go on a short limb and guess that they didn&rsquo;t set that policy due to the influence of New York Intellectuals or the Frankfurt School. </p>
<p>Like you say it&rsquo;s a fact of life and nationalism doesn&rsquo;t require dismissing such unfortunate people simply as perverts. </p>

<p>The latest thing in the GLTB community is gay men, or &#8216;transgenders&rsquo;, identifying as &#8216;lesbian&rsquo;. That is, they have the operation (or just dress up) but they want to be with a female partner, or another man that&rsquo;s dresses up as a substitute. Believe it or not. Honestly many of these gay men or whatever identify themselves as &#8216;lesbian&rsquo;.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just a money scam ran by psychiatrists and plastic surgeons, what&rsquo;s sickening is that they&rsquo;re actually allowed to take advantage of people like Michael Simpson, who clearly have mental issues to which the cure is not playing dress up and make believe.</p>

<p>This is racial in the sense that it is an attack on white Christian mores.</p>
<p>Toleration of these unfortunates is fine.  Appointment of such people to high office - is nuts. Promotion of this lifestyle as just one choice among many lifestyle choices is insane.  Alcoholics are saddled with a genetic predisposition to their malady as well.  That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s okay for them to appear drunk in public cursing in front of children.</p>
<p>As for Iran, you&rsquo;d be surprised at the influences there.  Isn&rsquo;t it peculiar that they have a student uprising much like we had in the 60&rsquo;s with many of the same demands.  Isn&rsquo;t it worth a closer look? </p>

<p>&ldquo;The latest thing in the GLTB community is gay men, or &lsquo;transgenders&rsquo;, identifying as &lsquo;lesbian&rsquo;.

<p>Not only do I believe it, I recall recently (about 4 or 5 months ago) seeing a television news blurb on this topic. I can&rsquo;t remember what the full circumstances were, but this &ldquo;lesbian&rdquo; trapped in a man&rsquo;s body was demanding that the state he lived in help fund his sexual reassignment. If I am remembering this correctly, he was halfway through his &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; into a &ldquo;lesbian,&rdquo; and somehow couldn&rsquo;t finish it because he had run out of money.</p>
<p>To say the least, I was appalled and disgusted. Not so much with the individual himself (though, I must note his pleas for taxpayer money found a less than sympathetic ear with me,) but with the psychological and medical personnel who had cleared this guy for the procedure in the first place. This is exactly what I was explaining above, regarding the issue of this surgery becoming far too commonplace and lacking a comprehensive screening process, as it once had. In the end, it is quite clear to me that a man making such sadly absurd claims as this fantasized &ldquo;lesbianism,&rdquo; is in need of some serious psychological/psychiatric care, but not a transsexual surgical &ldquo;solution&rdquo; to his problems. </p>
<p>All the best to you Anonymous #12,</p>

		<p>Personally, I feel uninterested in what consenting adults do in their personal lives. What enrages me is not gays&rsquo; or transgenders&rsquo; sexual orientation but the fact that they almost all seem part of the &#8220;Rainbow Coalition,&rdquo; i.e. Leftist Democrats. The &ldquo;Gay Agenda&rdquo; goes far beyond toleration of private behavior. I simply oppose &ldquo;sexual minorities&rdquo; becoming like blacks: on a pedestal, with everyone forced to celebrate them, hire them by quotas and turn a blind eye to any negative behavior on their part.</p>
<p>Are gays really oppressed? Who is more likely to be fired, assaulted or worse just for peacefully stating their views: gays or white nationalists? Gays have higher than average incomes. Who really concerns themselves with what others do in the bedroom? </p>
<p>&ldquo;Gay rights&rdquo; like all political correctness won&rsquo;t survive Western civilization. Post-apartheid South Africa was hailed for its &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; constitution which enshrined &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; rights. Why aren&rsquo;t gays flocking to South Africa? Is it the same reason South African whites are so desperate to get out? </p>
<p>What will happen to gays (or any liberals) once whites are a minority in this country? How do blacks, hispanics and muslims treat gays, transgenders, feminists, Jews or whites in general? The hated straight white man invented human rights, and only whites uphold them.<br>

		<p>I wasn&rsquo;t going to comment until I read the comments already posted.  I do not believe this is a gay issue.  I do not understand why gay organizations have taken up for transsexuals.  Gays are homosexuals, people who are physically and romantically attracted to members of the same sex.  Transsexuals have body dimorphic.</p>
<p>A transsexual is more akin to an anorexic than a homosexual.  A bag of bones looks in the mirror and see a fat woman, she has body dimorphic.  A man looks in a mirror and thinks he is in the wrong body and should be a female.  This is body dimorphic.  I do not understand either.  I have sympathy for people who are so troubled that they would disfigure their bodies through radical surgery.  But I do not need to know about it.  The big problem with our society is the total lack of discretion on everyone&rsquo;s part.  Why do we have to air all our business out on the line for all to see?  Why are we now such a vulgar society.</p>
<p>If sex change surgery makes this person content, well, that is a good thing.  But it should also have the decencies to keep this information to itself.  Obviously some people will know but the world doesn&rsquo;t need to.  And what about not embarrassing your child, your siblings, your parents, your ex-spouse?  I feel sorry for a 15 year old boy whose father could not wait until he was grown before becoming a &#8220;chick&#8221;.  That man chose to get married, chose to have a child.  He should taken responsibility for those decisions and waited until the boy was grown.  Selfish.</p>
<p>I have no problems with this person holding any job they are qualified for.  But I suppose when you live in a nation in which every other TV commercial is for either ED cures or incontinence then nothing is off limits.  Our society is truly course.<br>

<p>Seriously, I would have no problem with &#8220;Amanda&#8221; being hired if &#8220;she&#8221; were the most qualified applicant. Instead, this is probably just another affirmative action hire so the Messiah can &#8220;make history&#8221; and appease gay activists. </p>

		<p>Well, women competing with her are obvipusly at a disadvantage and the fact that s/he can now benefit from gender minority status disadvantages men competing with her.</p>
<p>Apart from that, anyone who is that much of an open activist on any controversial issue should not be given important security jobs in the government. It reeks of instability.</p>

		<p>A quick point to all,</p>
<p>Gay and other homosexual issues are just those; they are Gay and other homosexual issues, period. The co-opting of transgender issues into that dynamic, is simply another Marxist ploy at &ldquo;expanding&rdquo; the &ldquo;oppressed proletariat.&rdquo; And at the expense, of the transgender crowd in that kaleidoscopically &ldquo;expanded proletariat.&rdquo; </p>
<p>For the love of God, what have we come to?</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a &ldquo;lesbian trapped in a man&rsquo;s body,&rdquo; anymore than there is such a thing as a &ldquo;gay man trapped in a woman&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is really called, confused heterosexuality with a unfathomably bizarre multicultural twist!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!<br>

		<p>Let me say up front that I am someone who has had this surgery, and I am happy that I did it. What I am not happy about is the fact that I had this disorder. I loath the fact that I am not &#8216;normal&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I continue to live as a male and only a very people trusted friends know of my situation. I agree with many of the comments here and there are many so-called transgender people who are simply pathetic males who have no social skills to interact with people in a normal way, and they either live as females or some are able to have sex change surgery. I have known of at least 2 who had surgery to be prostitutes. Such people make me sick.</p>
<p>I hope this person Amanda Simpson has been appointed because of her skills and not because she is transgendered. I totally disagree with any appointment for any reason other than the persons skills and qualifications.</p>

<p>In the years that I have read American Renaissance, they have been very disciplined in avoiding controversies that are unrelated to race. They have avoided the gay issue, the transgender issue, free enterprise, and whether one identifies as a Christian or not.</p>
<p>They have strenously tried to build a big tent of white people, that includes pro-white conservatives, pro-white liberals, pro-white gays, pro-white Jews, pro-white capitalists, pro-white environmentalists, and any other pro-white person who is concerned about the threat of non-white immigration to America, especially that posed by hispanics and blacks.</p>
<p>I do not agree with American Renaissance&rsquo;s agenda, but I have marvelled at their rigid discipline in focusing on the race issue, something that other white nationalist groups fail to do. A gay friend from Los Angeles loves this website, because of his concern with Mexican take-over of the city, and its subsequent decline from being formerly one of the loveliest cities in America.</p>
<p>Ms. Evan&rsquo;s article may cause factionalism in Amren, which may split pro-white atheists from pro-white Christians, and pro-white conservatives from pro-white liberals. Amren was supposed to be a place where an elitist ivy-league educated pro-white person from Boston, could feel equally at home with a redneck pro-white mechanic from West Virginia. Now, we may face a culture war within Amren.     <br>

Gays have co-opted transgendered and others because gays know their numbers are smaller than they would like them to be. This is akin to blacks talking about the mythical &#8216;black/brown/people of color&rsquo; coalition they desperately want to believe in; it inflates their numbers giving them a sense of greater numbers and power.</p>
<p>BTW, I don&rsquo;t know of any openly bisexual organizations or advocacy groups. These people seem to have the advantage that they can hide their alternative sexual practices. I don&rsquo;t know any bisexuals who actually stand out or take a stand on any issue. They seem to only be included in the gay list of associates while not active participants.</p>
<p>We have clearly become a much more vulgar culture. I believe this is largely the result of need to stand out as unique and different. Individuals, the &#8216;arts&rsquo;, entertainment, advertising all depend on cutting through the din of popular culture. Hence the need to &#8220;shock&#8221; the public. It works. Do something shocking, and you make entertainment and eventually mainstream news.<br>

		<p>I have no problem with anyone with any sort of sexual identity problem living a normal life and that would include have a job like the one described. My real problem is when individuals like these as well as gays try to foist their situation off on innocent children. Most people would not want a heterosexual person describing sexual acts in graphic detail to a class of kindergarteners but this seems to be happening more and more in the name of &#8220;diversity&#8221;. I do think there is some biological component of homosexuality but lets let kids be kids and keep the sex out of it until later. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;shocking price to pay for sexual fulfillment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Has this author bothered to read anything written by the subjects of her article before she sat down to write?</p>
<p>I assume the author is a woman and feels like she&rsquo;s a woman. I wonder how content she&rsquo;d be if she woke up tomorrow with a man&rsquo;s body, while still feeling that she&rsquo;s a woman.</p>
<p>These gender changes are generally only very secondarily about sexual fulfillment. They&rsquo;re primarily about identity, about a person wanting to be who they feel they are, and not some weird creature who&rsquo;s one gender on the inside and another on the outside.</p>
<p>Valid discussion can be had about the proper place for such people in our society, but it should start with an understanding of what&rsquo;s being discussed.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in denying anyone the right to participate in society but I don&rsquo;t like anyone being given a post based on something that is artificially induced and then using their position to promote it among a populace that finds it repulsive.  If Mr./Mrs. Simpson had been a pedophile or pictures were circulated on the internet showing he/she/its fetish for waste products, he/she/it would never have made it throught the confirmation process.  What makes one perversion more acceptable than the other?  As a taxpayer, I do not want my hard earned money being used to support the salary of such a person.  If he/she/it wants to participate in society, he/she/it can do it off the dole.  Perhaps Simpson can go don a sequin dress and sing in a cabaret or become one of those drag celebrities impersonating Cher.</p>
<p>The majority of people in the White Nationalist movement are Christians and it&rsquo;s not helping the movement at all by courting a couple of thousand trannies.</p>

		<p>If it were still the 1950s, with our families and other institutions as strong as they were then, and existing in the much less toxic environment of back then, I think gayness, lesbianism, transgenderism, and the entire sexual smorgasbord could have been accommodated by society to a greater extent than it was then with no real injury to society.</p>
<p>But in today&rsquo;s world, it all becomes part of the lefty struggle to undo everything. So what to support and not support becomes more complex.</p>

<p>There is a consensus among a number of people that the present system is unworkable and the best thing to do is let it collapse in on itself.  No more welfare, no more government checks, no more social security, disability, affirmative action, etc.  These liberal progressive types will be trapped in their multicultural paradises when the race riots start.  No one is going to be worrying about sex changes and gay marriage when there&rsquo;s no electricity and no food to be found and the constant threat of violence from their former black allies.  Amid the chaos people will be looking for strong leadership and that&rsquo;s when strong men of good character step in and take over.  </p>

		<p>In response to #30:</p>
<p>It would be in the interest of non-Liberal heterosexual White men to ally with homosexual White men. The situation for White men is so grave that matters of personal taste in these matters are insignificant. Homosexual men can make valuable allies in this conflict. </p>
<p>Homosexual White men are White men who have effective networking for security and employment. Homosexual men cannot be sexually manipulated by women. Thus homosexuals can only be manipulated politically. In this regard, heterosexual men have made it easy for their enemies. For example, not opposing same sex marriage would be a good move for White men. It would cost us nothing, and marriage has become anything but a sacred institution. Nor do many of them have children or families that can be threatened with injury or poverty. This is a weapon often used against heterosexeual White men.</p>
<p>To respond to the second part: It&rsquo;s is not a matter of saving Liberal society; it&rsquo;s about personal and racial survival.<br>

		<p>My goodness&hellip; Where did all these mismatched components come from? I still can&rsquo;t help but postulate that outside of external chemical influences&hellip; a great deal of the rest of this stuff comes from deformed thinking that eventually translates into deformed body chemistry/hormones&hellip;.perhaps in the pregnant woman or later in a developing child. Well no matter the origin I do feel sorry for any unlucky soul born into a situation with hellish torments attatched. Still I suggest to all&hellip; first off&hellip; put the world on hold&hellip;Its not your judge..and secondly theirs some good thinking by guys like Carl Jung and other more modern psychoanylists easily available in books which may help you to release yourself from deeply imbeded mental traps that were inoccently lodged there by loved ones..parents etc. People can become very damaged by powerful role models.. especially when the role models were in other things good. Largely because an injured person can&rsquo;t dare bring themselves to offiliate something twisted in themselves with someone they have as a cherrished figure. Edward Gein&hellip;the lovely monster that was known as buffalo Bill or something in silence of the lambs was a horrid criminal. He was raised by a smothering christian mother that never ceased to warn him about sin and evil women.. etc. Not knocking Christianity but rather its misuse.  </p>

<b> &#8220;Is the White race so paralyzed, impotent and debased that it must forge alliances with homosexuals and transvestites?&#8221;   </b></p>
<p><br>
Excuse me, sir, your prejudice is showing.  What is this &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;they&#8221; mentality? You speak of these people as if they are another race&hellip; or an alien species!   They are just as white as you are. They should have no need to forge alliances with  <i>their own kind</i>to protect what are THEIR OWN interests. </p>
<p>Let me ask Reality some questions:  Are whites not already virtually &#8220;paralyzed and impotent&#8221;?  Are whites today in a position where they can afford to be picky?  Can losers be choosers?</p>
<p>On the other hand, has the white race, thus far, been so successful in defending and promoting its own interests, and is it in such a secure position today that it can afford to alienate  talented &amp; useful  people whom some individuals may dislike   &mdash;   simply for issues that are irrelevant to the topic of race?</p>
<p>These people, if rejected by such as you, will be forced into the waiting and gleeful arms of the Left, which has been cultivating them for many decades.  And people like you wonder why!</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t like some ethnic group, or some religious persuasion,  or some sexual orientation, shall we alienate/eject  them all, because we are already so successful that we don&rsquo;t need their support?  Have we learned nothing at all - yet - about the importance of solidarity, or shall we continue practicing the politics of divisiveness &hellip; which have had us on the path to nowhere for the past century?</p>
<p>It seems to me that sex is a hot potato,  another area -  like vegetarianism, or religion   &mdash;   that  race realists would do best to stay out of.</p>
