<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Murray [Edwin R. Murray, a state senator and until recently the front-running black candidate for mayor of New Orleans] also said in a statement that he had dropped out to avoid a racially divisive campaign. {snip}</p>
<p>The New Orleans Tribune, an African-American newsmagazine, called Mr. Murray&rsquo;s decision &#8220;a betrayal of the black community.&#8221; At a news conference, Mr. Henry castigated the news media for having &#8220;prematurely crowned the next mayor as a white mayor.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black professionals refer to the office [of mayor] as &#8220;the franchise,&#8221; the counterweight to the economic power of New Orleans&rsquo;s white elite. For the past three decades, the black private sector  &mdash;  the lawyers, businessmen and architects  &mdash;  has relied on the franchise: they may not always be able to become board members at the city&rsquo;s white-owned firms, but black professionals turned to the city government for contracts and jobs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The critical thing for the African-American community is to be much more focused on a clear agenda,&#8221; [Bill Rouselle, owner of a public relations and consulting firm, who helped engineer Ray Nagin&rsquo;s re-election in 2006 and who had been working for Mr. Murray&rsquo;s campaign] {snip} said, &#8220;the agenda being followed became a secondary concern to getting a black person elected.&#8221;</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Black professionals refer to the office [of mayor] as &ldquo;the franchise,&rdquo; the counterweight to the economic power of New Orleans&rsquo;s white elite. For the past three decades, the black private sector &mdash; the lawyers, businessmen and architects &mdash; has relied on the franchise: they may not always be able to become board members at the city&rsquo;s white-owned firms, but black professionals turned to the city government for contracts and jobs.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This kind of tortuous rationalization nauseates me.  So blacks regard the office of Mayor as their exclusive property, but we mustn&rsquo;t begrudge them because they&rsquo;re so poor and victimized and excluded from &#8220;the economic power of New Orleans&rsquo; White elite.&#8221;  And of course, blacks can <i>never </i>be Racists.  </p>
<p>Could it possibly be that blacks <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> be &#8220;excluded&#8221; from all that power if they were intelligent and hard-working enough to make themselves part of it?  No, it&rsquo;s so much easier to ride the coattails of &#8220;the franchise,&#8221; knowing that <i>no</i> one will ever be permitted to publicly call them out on it.</p>

		<p>So blacks in New Orleans believe that it is the purpose of the mayor&rsquo;s office is to take taxes from predominately white people and hand them over to black owners of second rate businesses that apparently can&rsquo;t win a bid on their own merits.  So this country <i>does</i> have institutional racism - by black people.</p>
<p>Just imagine if anywhere in the USA the white residents of a city said they had to elect a white mayor so they could preserve &#8220;the franchise&#8221; in which city contracts are steered to white owned businesses when at all possible.  This would be national news.  It would be the lead story on all the network news shows   &mdash;   all about the wicked white people trying to steer government money to whites.  The SPLC would fire up another multimillion dollar fund raising campaign, with this story in the lead fear mongering article.  And of course there would be lawsuits and federal agents sent in to set things right.</p>
<p>But as always, blacks get a pass.</p>

<p>      It&rsquo;s possible, but not very likely. Mitch Landrieu isn&rsquo;t exactly a Conservative. He&rsquo;s more like a home grown/local scalawag, who isn&rsquo;t particularly well liked by most Cajuns or whites outside NOLA. However, compared to the others&hellip;</p>
