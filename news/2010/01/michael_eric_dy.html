			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Boyce Watkins, Black Voices, January 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Georgetown University Professor Michael Eric Dyson criticized President Barack Obama for avoiding racial issues last night on MSNBC:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that we should push the president. This president runs from race like a black man runs from a cop. What we have to do is ask Mr. Obama to stand up and use his bully pulpit to help us. He is loathe to speak about race.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear on the following facts:</p>
<p>1) Yes, Obama is afraid to talk about race, for good reason. Dyson is right, but to be clear, President Obama doesn&rsquo;t run from race like a black man runs from the police. He runs from race like a black politician running from angry white voters. The only exception to Obama&rsquo;s race-neutral strategy was the &#8220;debacle heard around the world,&#8221; otherwise known as the Henry Louis Gates Case. In that situation, Obama&rsquo;s desire to protect his Harvard homeboy exposed some very disturbing elitism on the part of the president (he never would have spoken up for a poor black man shot in the street, but would yell and scream for a Harvard professor who was inconvenienced). It also wasted a valuable opportunity to intelligently and respectfully address race. By saying that the police &#8220;acted stupidly,&#8221; even though he didn&rsquo;t know all the facts and that he was &#8220;admittedly biased&#8221; about this otherwise insignificant occurrence, Obama not only insulted every fair-minded American watching the press conference, he blew his right to talk about race for at least another year. In other words, white people put Barack Obama on punishment. The president doesn&rsquo;t address race because HE CAN&rsquo;T address race and still keep his job. His license of racial trust has been revoked and he must now become a president who just happens to be black. America will have it no other way.</p>
<p>2) {snip}I don&rsquo;t expect, nor do I even want Barack Obama contributing to the National Conversation on race, because when politicians are too heavily involved in anything, they end up mangling the critical issues. This debate belongs to the American people.</p>
<p>3) {snip} Barack has his own sense of blackness, but that must be balanced with the fact that the whiteness in his blood needs to be acknowledged and respected as well. Additionally, the brother has to keep his job, and he&rsquo;s not going to be able to do that by wearing a dashiki to work  &mdash;  nor would he be willing to sacrifice his political power for African-American causes. At the same time, Barack Obama must realize that many African Americans are not going to patiently allow him to dismantle and undermine meaningful struggles for civil rights to open the door for him to play politics with those who hate us. So, Mr. President, if you are going to throw black men under the bus with condescending church speeches upholding racial stereotypes, then don&rsquo;t be surprised if we throw you under the bus as well.</p>
<p>The National Conversation on Race has begun. The President and other politicians are not invited until they are willing and able to do what&rsquo;s best for the American people. {snip}  The conversation on race starts and ends with the citizens, and we aren&rsquo;t running away from anything.</p>

This from a man who believes rap is a vital, socially relevant expression for blacks.</p>
<p>Read the lyrics to Jay-zs&rsquo; &#8220;99 Problems&#8221; (which has a subheading that won&rsquo;t make it past the filter) and keep in mind that 60 Minutes did a fawning expose of Mr. Z and Oprah has had him on her show:</p>

		<p>Blacks, be they professors or common street thugs, don&rsquo;t want a conversation about anything - they want spoils, money, power(in short, what many white people have)and they don&rsquo;t want to have to do a damned thing to get it, instead relying on the same tired claptrap about &#8220;oppression,&#8221; &#8220;discrimination,&#8221; slavery, and what have you. That is the whole issue in a nutshell. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve missed any serious &#8216;punishments&rsquo; the president has suffered for ethical lapses, inconsistencies and raging contradiction.  He surrenders the  moral high ground like it&rsquo;s kryptonite and is never truly taken to task for so doing.  Most politicians are treated the same.  Free Blago!</p>

		<p>Dyson is simply championing the blacks as victims mantra. He&rsquo;s in a position to do that any way he can. I suspect liberals understand that if Obama were to try and play the game too it might be the beginning of a backlash they all know is coming and really would like to stave off as long as demonly possible. </p>
<p>Dyson can say he&rsquo;s angry at Obama all he wants it doesn&rsquo;t make it true. </p>

		<p>If a White professor made the analogy that Obama runs away from race issues &#8220;like a Black man runs from the police&#8221;, it&rsquo;d be a headline news story and Al Sharpton would be on every cable news show flapping his maw about &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Are we supposed to believe that Michael Eric Dyson and all the other black &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; supposedly showing frustration with President Obama will vote for the Republican in 2012?  They out to put their money where their mouths are.  Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll just have to sit here and believe it&rsquo;s all a scam, an effort to make Obama appear &#8220;moderate&#8221; by having his extremist supporters denounce his moderation.  </p>

		<p>Dyson is one of the biggest black malcontents in the country today on a par with Jeremiah &#8220;The White Hatemonger&#8221; wright.</p>
<p>As is the case with almost every black who works for a university, he isn&rsquo;t qualified beyond a high school level.</p>
<p>He was raling on t.v. a few weeks back that whites treated &#8220;people of color&#8221; atrociously throughout history.  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t blacks like him just love to include themselves in with other non-whites?  Note that he&rsquo;s careful NEVER to ramble off into a subject that would lead to somebody pointing out that ALL the races do better than blacks mentally, which leaves blacks lagging behind the whole world all by themselves.</p>

		<p>blacks are so naive that they even thought Obama was going to pay their mortgage and all their other bills so that they wouldn&rsquo;t have to work.  Sorry people, but if you are entitled to something, then someone&rsquo;s rights have to be given up so you can have it. </p>

		<p>Now why would black men be running from the cops if they&rsquo;d done nothing wrong?</p>
<p>Dyson must be thinking of his brother Everett, a drug dealer doing life for murder. Of course the Prof. claims his brother is an innocent victim of a racist justice system.</p>

		<p>Black &#8220;scholars&#8221; such as Michael Eric Dyson are insufferable. He spends most of his time whining about whites while appearing on major networks. He is simply a self-promoter who wants to gain exposure and make some good money, just like Tim Wise, whom he deeply admires. Despite constantly railing against Capitalism, those two will charge ridiculous speaker fees (at least Tim Wise does). </p>
<p>I find it amusing the way blacks always say &#8220;people of color.&#8221; Sorry, but DeShawn from Oakland has little in common with a well-educated Asian American. &#8220;People of color&#8221; is really an attempt to unite all non-whites in order to annihilate whites. Fortunately, for now, that rainbow has never flourished.</p>

A &#8220;conversation about race&#8221; means a black person chiding whites for racism and blaming us for all the failures of the black race in an effort to acquire power and money.  Oh, and some white women, too.</p>

		<p>Obama has no doubt figured out that within a generation blacks will no longer be the &#8220;favored minority.&#8221; That status will be occupied by Hispanics, who do not display the unwarranted guilt or tolerance of whites. Hispanics do not even like blacks. Obama knows that currying favor with Hispanics is essential for the future political success of both parties. This will come as a great surprise to blacks and will be thhe cause of infighting and even violence between blacks and Hispanics over access to such goodies as affirmative action. Another reason why we should close the floodgates and evict the burglars in our home.</p>

		<p>The &#8221; Beer Summit &#8221; debacle and Jeremiah Wright are the least of the Great Pontificator&rsquo;s race offenses. If Whites had any sense they would take him to task over Eric Holder at the Justice Dept. If Obama wants to get his &#8221; race card&#8221; reinstated putting Holder on the chopping block for obstruction of justice over the Black Panther incident would be a great start and would ease the minds of many whites in regards to fair and equal protection under the law. His appointment of the &#8221; wise Latina&#8221; is not appreciated either.</p>

That&rsquo;s the problem with black bigots.  Other non-whites get along with whites more and even lots of non-blacks don&rsquo;t care for blacks.</p>
