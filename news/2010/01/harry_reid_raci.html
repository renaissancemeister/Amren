			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Sappenfield, Christian Science Monitor, January 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Critics of President Obama  &mdash;  Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele foremost among them  &mdash;  see no small amount of hypocrisy in Mr. Obama&rsquo;s forgiveness of Senate majority leader Harry Reid.</p>
<p>Senator Reid is quoted in a new book by two journalists about the 2008 campaign, &#8220;Game Change,&#8221; as saying privately that the US would be &#8220;ready to embrace a black presidential candidate, especially one such as Obama  &mdash;  a &#8216;light-skinned&rsquo; African American &#8216;with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one.&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>When the quotes came to light Saturday, Reid apologized to Obama, and Obama accepted. Mr. Steele and other say that is political relativism, with Democrats evading punishment for comments that would have sunk Republicans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The Lott precedent</b></p>
<p>But what about 2002, asked Mr. Steele on Sunday morning talk shows?</p>
<p>Then, a Republican Senate majority leader (Trent Lott) was ousted because he, too, made insensitive racial remarks: The nation would have been much better off if Strom Thurmond had won his presidential bid in 1948, Senator Lott told Mr. Thurmond at Thurmond&rsquo;s 100th birthday celebration. Thurmond&rsquo;s 1948 platform backed racial segregation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Democratic Committee Chairman Timothy Kaine sought to explain the discrepancy on the Sunday morning talk shows. Reid&rsquo;s comments were in a positive context  &mdash;  supporting Obama&rsquo;s candidacy  &mdash;  whereas Lott&rsquo;s appeared to suggest that segregation of black Americans was a good thing, Mr. Kaine said.<br>

		<p>I saw this on &#8216;The View&rsquo; today. The girls on the show completely controlled the context of the argument. What a slap to the face of Strom Thurmond, even on your 100th birthday celebration&hellip;</p>
<p>I have no idea if Thrumond was good or bad (he was probably a &#8216;yellow-dog&rsquo; democrat), I&rsquo;m too young to know, but what a slap to the face. I guess when it comes to concern about &#8216;sensitivity&rsquo; Strom Thurmond doesn&rsquo;t count. And some folks are more important than others. </p>

		<p>Trent Lott said nice things to a 100 year old at his bithday bash.  That is called good manners.  You do not bash someone at their birthday party.  Plus he said nothing wrong, maybe he would have in fact been a better president than LBJ.</p>
<p>Harry Reid made an observation.  An observation that was in fact spot on.  He said nothing ofensive.  I do not like him but punsihing people for speach is very soviet.</p>

I&rsquo;m torn by this one.</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t like tit-for-tat, the Democrats ripped Senator Lott to shreds so I can see the Republicans demanding the same zero tolerance. However, I believe everyone should be allowed to speak freely and without political consequences.</p>
<p>The only good I see coming from this is that if Senator Reid is given a pass, the Democrats would lose some of their power to attack the next time a Republican speaks his mind.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see how forgiving they&rsquo;ll be next time.<br>

		<p>&ldquo;When the quotes came to light Saturday, Reid apologized to Obama, and Obama accepted. Mr. Steele and other say that is political relativism, with Democrats evading punishment for comments that would have sunk Republicans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course had Comrade Reid been a Republican, he would have been &ldquo;sunk;&rdquo; this is simply because, if he were a Republican, he would have groveled at the feet of his enemies and not his Comrades!</p>
<p>Indeed, it might be &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; that Comrade Reid is going to sail through this, but that is because the Democrats are always willing to unscrupulously twist a situation to their advantage. Already the Tingler (aka, Comrade Matthews) and Upchuck Todd on MSNBC, are aiding in this venture, just as the propagandists in the White House want them to. It all boils down to turning Comrade Reid into a slightly befuddled, but also &ldquo;honest,&rdquo; observer of America&rsquo;s &ldquo;racist&rdquo; underpinnings. He was simply noting the &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; according to the party line and no harm was meant; in fact, he was really being hopeful that because Comrade BO wasn&rsquo;t too black, that he had a realistic chance of winning. Thus, accentuating the overall &ldquo;racism&rdquo; of whites and how he would overcome it through both birthright luck and political &ldquo;mastery.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This is never the case with Republicans, who always seek to capitalize on coherent white majority support, while paradoxically wallowing in multicultural &ldquo;white guilt.&rdquo; The example of Comrade Lott, is a case in point. He was quite correct in observing that: &ldquo;The nation would have been much better off if Strom Thurmond had won his presidential bid in 1948.&rdquo; Moreover, in admitting as much, he was acknowledging that this horrible tsunami of Marxism and genocidal anti-white dogma that encompasses current mature multiculturalism, would have been smothered in its cradle.  </p>
<p>Nothing wrong with that, it is the plain truth!</p>
<p>However, he never said as much, never defended himself, and found his fellow Republicans all too eager to &ldquo;tolerantly&rdquo; lynch him on grounds of diversity worship. He witlessly and gutlessly obliged them, and repeatedly self-immolated at the alter of multiculturalism and in the temples of his and his party&rsquo;s most vociferous opponents.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>The sickening part of this story is that Lott and Reid were both telling the truth and speaking from the heart and soul when they made those comments.However in this Orwellian age they must grovel and apologize because putting on a smiley face and lying to their party bosses and voters is what counts rather than the truth.We should get angry when these politicians lie instead of when they tell the uncomfortable truth.This is why we deserve what we get from our so called leaders.</p>

		<p>What scares me the most about the Reid-Obama non-controversy is that it reminds a lot of people of the Lott-Thurmond non-controversy of late 2002, and then, it was actually Republicans and neo-cons who took the lead in demanding Trent Lott&rsquo;s ouster:</p>

		<p>Although I&rsquo;m no fan of either Reid or lily-livered Lott, neither one of them said anything that wasn&rsquo;t TRUE. I thought I was the only one that noticed that Obama had a White voice and a black voice. And as usual, our White &#8220;leaders&#8221; are falling all over themselves to prove they&rsquo;re not &#8220;racisss&#8221;. See, that&rsquo;s where they &#8220;mess&#8221; up. They need to stand up and say &#8220;yes that&rsquo;s what I said, and unless you can prove me wrong, shut the hell up.&#8221; Don&rsquo;t you just know the NAACP and the CBC are laughing their behinds off about getting White folks to argue amongst themselves over who kisses black behind better. That&rsquo;s why I could never be in politics, I couldn&rsquo;t do this. My limo would have to be a Brinks truck with special forces and missiles surrounding it for my safety.  </p>

		<p>This whole controversy is simply ridiculous.  Harry Reid made a couple of truthful observations that were in no way meant to express racial hatred towards anyone.  It is really sad to see &#8220;conservatives&#8221; sell out in order to score political points.</p>

		<p>The MSM, both left and right, has yet to stop blabbering non-stop about this.  Reid should have just shrugged and told the press he sees nothing wrong or incorrect about his statements.  Apologizing does absolutely nothing except to establish that someone did something wrong.  And, as usual, blacks make themselves look even worse in the eyes of whites by behaving as though there&rsquo;s something wrong with being black.</p>

		<p>Seems that book &#8220;Game Change&#8221; has caused quite a stir  &mdash;  and I haven&rsquo;t read one report yet of any of those quotes or actions being denied.</p>
<p>Given what we know about black crime and in particular the fact that blacks specifically target Whites, especially White women, for rape, torture, assault and murder, Trent Lott was correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonder Whites don&rsquo;t march on black communities screaming &#8216;No Justice, No Peace!&rsquo; until black crime against the White community is stopped.  This is indicative of the reign of tyranny, War on Whites and break down of the Rule of Law Whites are forced to live under, imposed by the media, government and academia.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Reid apologized to Obama, and Obama accepted&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet, for Rush, Lott, Palin and Imus, no mercy:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Wednesday afternoon, Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., called for the firing of talk radio host Don Imus&hellip;.&rsquo;nobody on my staff who would still be working for me if they made a comment like that about anybody of any ethnic group. And I would hope that NBC ends up having that same attitude.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hopefully, Talk Radio and the Internet will keep this going because as far as the government and media are concerned this is over (but not for Imus, Rush, Zoeller, Palin..).</p>

		<p>Check out this great site http://raceandethnicity.tk/ to see get a bird&rsquo;s eye view om the debate. You won&rsquo;t believe some of the remarks!</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet all expressions of racism are not equivalent.  Republicans have made hay of Reid&rsquo;s remark and the Democrats&rsquo; responses to it.  If Trent Lott had to resign as Senate Majority Leader because of his unseemly remarks about black people, they argue, so too should Reid.  However, where Reid and Biden revealed the extent to which they had absorbed white supremacy in the form of images, assumptions, and expectations, Lott expressed regret for the passing of white supremacy as a political and economic program.  In celebrating Strom Thurmond&rsquo;s 100th birthday, Lott commented that Mississippi had voted for the Thurmond in 1948, the year he broke off from the Democrats and ran for president as a Dixiecrat in order to protect Jim Crow.  &ldquo;And if the rest of the country had followed our lead,&rdquo; Lott added, &ldquo;we wouldn&rsquo;t have had all these problems over all these years, either.&rdquo;&#8221; HNN </p>

		<p>When Reid says something &#8220;inartful,&#8221; according to Obummer, he gets a pass, but when Imus says something similar, he gets pilloried. What a hypocritical double standard! At any rate, what Reid said was accurate and everyone knows it&hellip;</p>

		<p>It won&rsquo;t be long that this nonsense about racist this and racist that will be coming to an end.</p>
<p>Why?  Because economics will replace the concentration on nonsensical matters of race.  In other words, the entire country will be so engrossed in trying to climb out of the economic abyss we&rsquo;re slowly slipping into the media driven racial highlighting will be replaced by sordid accounts of states going bankrupt causing chaos in every quarter due to job losses and falling revenues.</p>
<p>Whether Harry Reid might color his language that black paranoids will deem offensive or not will give way to concern about surviving economically and physically.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written many times that the country will be forced to legalize drugs, because local jurisdictions and the feds will  need the revenue from the sale of them to bolster the shortfalls in their budgets, even more desperately than when they legalized gambling.  Well, here&rsquo;s the beginning of legalizing marijuana by California which itself is looking at bankruptcy:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/politics/Planting-the-Seed-for-Legal-Pot-81222877.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/politics/Planting-the-Seed-for-Legal-Pot-81222877.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The mere fact that there will be votes in the Assembly to regulate and control the sale and distribution of marijuana would have been unthinkable even one year ago.&#8221; Retired Orange County California Supreme Court Judge Jim Gray said in a press release. &#8220;And if the bill doesn&rsquo;t pass this year, it will soon. Or, the bill will be irrelevant because the voters will have passed the measure to regulate and tax marijuana that will be on the ballot this November.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marijuana will be first, other drugs will follow suit.</p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t to say, however, that the legalization of drugs in itself is going to divert attention away from similar statements by those like Harry Reid, nor will the revenue from their sale solve our financial situuation.  What will happen, however is that statements deemed racially offensive won&rsquo;t be given much consideration, and I, for one, will be glad to see the change take place.</p>
<p>This business of trying to regulate everybody&rsquo;s thinking has gotten so far out of hand it has reached the realm of absurdity.</p>

		<p>How is this going to harm Reid in Nevada. The state is less than 2% black. Reid should be in the joint for his dealings with Jack Abramoff but the sacred Statute of Limitations has run out.Most republicans, over 50% of all voters, only wish he used the term uppity.The unions will help in steal the vote like they did last time. maybe this time he will use the N bomb,let`s all hope so.<br>

<p>That was my point.  It&rsquo;s nonsense for the Republicans for wanting Reid&rsquo;s head as a matter of &#8220;tit-for-tat&#8221; for what the Democrats did to Trent Lott, b/c the Democrats didn&rsquo;t do anything to Trent Lott in late 2002.  It&rsquo;s sometimes good to have a long memory, and one of the things I most acutely remember about the Lott-Thurmond non-scandal is that the loudest mouths for Lott&rsquo;s head were other Republicans, mainly neo-con talking heads and columnists, Peggy Noonan, Colin Powell (Who would so graciously reward the Republican Party 6 years later), and eventually President Bush.  A liberal newspaper writer, I think it was Tom Edsall in the WaPo, thanked the Republicans for &#8220;taking the lead against bigotry,&#8221; and chided his own party for being non-existent.  The Democrats were mostly silent, I think mainly b/c election day had already passed, and therefore it was of no use to them to complain about Lott.</p>

		<p>What is really killer about this whole afair is that there are appear to be more Whites that are offended than blacks.  It is quite interesting seeing some of the PC Whites (Hannity and the gang) attacking Reid&rsquo;s character over his &#8216;insensitive&rsquo; obummer comments.</p>
<p>I have written this in the past, but I have much more comtempt for Whites that attack their own because they believe them to be racist than I do the black that capitlize on it.  How on earth did perferring you own kind and recognizing that we are not all equal become such an issue?  There is forgiveness for every horid crime imaginable except for being racist.  The word seems to change meaning daily.  Frankly, I believe many of us to be quite sick of it.  I will note however that the word seems to have lost some of punch.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s on fire and like many have said in the past, I am for a third party with a platform to based on the interests of WHITES ONLY!</p>

		<p>What I find most interesting about this is that the reaction is not breaking down along political or racial lines. Some Dems are offended at how non-PC Reid was, others excuse him because he is a lib. Some Reps agree with Reid for the first time in their life while others don&rsquo;t like the Lott double standard. </p>
<p>I have seen blacks disagree with each other on this as well on different forums. Some are offended while others say Reid told it like it is.<br>

And let us not forget in the Trent Lott fiasco that it was Karl Rove and George Bush that trumpted the loudest for Lott to step down as the majority leader.</p>
<p>What is sickening is the apology tour? It makes you want to cringe.</p>
<p>I was finishing up my undergraduate work then when Lott got in trouble and this was the exact time I had stumbled onto American Renaissance.  It took me two elections and looking back on this event to see how worthless the Republican Party was for real conservative and real Western and pro-white values.  That&rsquo;s why I won&rsquo;t vote for a Republican again.</p>

		<p>The one thing that is so clear about all the after affects is the support that Democrats give to each other no matter what they do or say.  As soon as the Trent Lott birthday speech reached the airwaves, the Republicans were calling for him to resign.  That&rsquo;s another similarity amongst Democrats and blacks, they stick together no matter what.  This guy could have said the N word and they would forgive him.</p>
