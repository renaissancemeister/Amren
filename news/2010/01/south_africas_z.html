			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Franz Wild, Business Week, January 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>South African President Jacob Zuma, a Zulu traditionalist who practices polygamy, married his third wife today.</p>
<p>Zuma, who has 19 children, married Thobeka Madiba, according to the state-owned South African Broadcasting Corp. The president, 67, is also engaged to Gloria Bongi Ngema, the South African Press Association reported, without saying where it got the information.</p>
<p>Zuma&rsquo;s openness about his polygamy has triggered a debate on the role of traditional values in a modern South Africa, said Adam Habib, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s sending a signal that he&rsquo;s not ashamed of the cultural value systems that he subscribes to and he shares this with a significant portion of the population,&#8221; Habib said in a phone interview from Durban. Last month Zuma attended the Zulu Ukweshwama ritual, where a bull is killed by a crowd with their bare hands to celebrate the coming harvest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Private Ceremony</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Zuma is South Africa&rsquo;s first Zulu president and the first polygamist president. While Nelson Mandela, South Africa&rsquo;s first black president, is now married to his third wife he divorced his first two. Thabo Mbeki has only married once.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he is able to look after his family, any man can do that,&#8221; McCloud Vanqa, a 72-year-old with six wives, said as he smoked a cigarette at a bar in Alexandra, a township in northern Johannesburg. &#8220;It&rsquo;s better to marry the women than to make them concubines.&#8221;</p>
<p>The presidency declined to comment on the marriage details, saying the wedding was &#8220;a private family ceremony.&#8221;</p>

		<p>They had a picture of Jacob in the paper doing the foot stomping dance that is part of the marriage ritual. The man is 67 and looked to be having a hard time? Well, the Zulu are a people with rugged constitutions and are noted for their physcial adeptness, so they can probably handle it.</p>

		<p>Good for Jacob! I&rsquo;m glad to see Africans sticking with their roots. Us trying to make them Western has only brought further misery to this branch of humanity. Let these folks be themselves&hellip;</p>

		<p>I want Zuma to travel to America for a brief visit, and his whole family is welcome.  Liberalism is a white mental disorder and Mr. Zuma can help to put it down.</p>

		<p>Upon reading this article and watching the video so generously provided by 4 Anonymous, I see this marriage as being wrong on so many levels. The celebratory dance looked like something out of a National Geographic Special rather than the wedding of a modern head of state. All the animals that were slaughtered so the participants could adorn themselves is a travesty. Where are the conservationists and the feminists?</p>
<p>Who is paying to support all these wives and children? The South African taxpayer, which is a mostly white contribution, that&rsquo;s who.</p>
<p>I was glad to see the bride and groom had matching, white running shoes. Perhaps this adornment was symbolic of South Africa&rsquo;s mission to stamp out the white race in its pursuit of white genocide.</p>

<p>Which are  becoming as rare and hard pressed as we White taxpaying slaves here in the U.S. both from the same malaise.</p>

		<p>Five wives?<br>
Concubines?<br>
Dancing in animal pelts with a spear?<br>
And their leader having a shower to protect himself from possible HIV infection?<br>
What century are these people from?<br>
Is it even an &#8216;Anno Domini&rsquo; year or century?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad that we live in a world where it&rsquo;s only on sites such as Amren where we are free to comment on such oddities without consequence.  </p>

		<p>There is another issue here. When a society has polygamy, it means that powerful men gain something of a monopoly on nubile females. This creates a large pool of young single men who compete ruthlessly for the remaining females. Inevitably, this leads to communal conflict and bloodshed. Given the continual scapegoating of Whites in the new South Africa, one suspects that this violence will be turned against those same Whites. One might even ask if the current high rates of murder, rape and farm attacks directed against Whites in the &#8220;rainbow nation&#8221; are a manifestation of this phenomenon. </p>
