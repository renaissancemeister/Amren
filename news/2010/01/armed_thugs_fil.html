<h1>Armed Thugs Filling Haiti&rsquo;s Security Void</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan M. Katz, AP, January 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If you don&rsquo;t kill the criminals, they will all come back,&#8221; a Haitian police officer shouts over a loudspeaker in the country&rsquo;s most notorious slum, imploring citizens to take justice into their own hands.</p>
<p>The call for vigilantes comes as influential gang leaders who escaped from a heavily damaged prison during the country&rsquo;s killer earthquake are taking advantage of a void left by police and peacekeepers focused on disaster relief.</p>
<p>In the sprawling Cite Soleil slum, gangsters are settling into the haunts they dominated before being locked up and resuming struggles for control that never really ended once they were inside the walls of the city&rsquo;s notorious main penitentiary.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There is the potential for violence in any disaster zone where food and medical aid are unable to keep up with fast-growing hunger and mass casualties. But the danger is multiplied in Haiti, where self-designated rebels and freedom fighters  &mdash;  or simply neighborhood toughs  &mdash;  have consistently threatened the country&rsquo;s fragile stability with a few weapons, some spare money for handouts and the ire of disaffected throngs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even as we are digging bodies out of buildings, they are trying to attack our officers,&#8221; Cite Soleil police inspector Aristide Rosemond said, surrounded by officers wielding automatic weapons.</p>
<p>Neighborhood residents say three people died and several women were raped in a small-scale turf war that gangsters nicknamed &#8220;Belony&#8221; and &#8220;Bled&#8221; launched in the seaside slum in the days after last Tuesday&rsquo;s quake.</p>
<p>People who live here have been told not to count on security forces for help.</p>

		<p> The citizens are most likely unarmed civilians that can only throw rocks at the criminals so what are they to do? The country is also ruled by thugs that are on top at the moment and the citizens know that yesterdays thug could easily be tommorrows president so they will hunker down and simply protect their own as best than can.</p>

		<p>No offense but that is actually very good advice.</p>
<p>If the Haitians weren&rsquo;t incredibly insane villains, their men would basically ban together and enforce a lawful society that actively and aggressively hunted down the anti-social and gave them a swift execution.  The rest of their effort would be geared toward providing for their community, families and love ones.</p>
<p>The problem with this is those listening to what is being said over the loudspeaker are roughly 90% anti-social.</p>
<p>There will be a lot of killing in Haiti.  But it won&rsquo;t be toward the purpose of protecting their society (such that it is) from evil doers.  It will basically be a large scale opportunity for the general populace to join in the mayhem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to become harder and harder to cover up what is going on there.</p>

		<p>This is the type of apocalypse that is shown in the movies. A road warrior type of genre where the &#8220;champion&#8221; gives the bad guy or guys their just due.</p>
<p>In the case of a nuclear attack upon a U.S. city by terrorists, street gangs would be come the force, the law, the governing body, in lieu of the police and other governmental agencies becoming helpless in the face of casualties. Look at New Orleans. The police, 1/5th of which just took off, the remainder quickly becoming mentally and physically broken down, unable to function as a unit, etc.</p>
<p>The villains in Haiti pose such a threat that lethal force can be used to combat them? Kill on sight becoming acceptable in self defense.?</p>

		<p>Some of these good citizens are simply too weak(and there are many) will not be either armed or assertive enough to defend themselves from the thugs who true to their violent,criminalistic predatory ways will prey on the weak,injured,the women,girls and the kids-above poster was right about this disaster being a &#8220;golden opportunity&#8221; for real men to band together,rise above fear and danger and meet this crisis head-on to protect,provide and rescue their families,communities  neighbours,and themselves.Unfortuneately most of these Haitian &#8220;men&#8221;(thug-males see this as &#8220;golden opportunity &#8220;for wholesale rapine,looting and murder. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not buying the MSM argument that most of the looting and violence is being organized by escaped prisoners.  That prison housed 4,000 felons before the earthquake, but how many survived the prison collapse uninjured?  A few hundred?  Maybe a thousand at most?  </p>
<p>In a city with millions of volatile people, a few hundred lightly armed gangsters can&rsquo;t be realistically blamed for the grotesque social chaos in Haiti.  It wasn&rsquo;t the escaped prisoners who built roadblocks out of dead bodies, stomped free food into the ground and looted everything in sight.  </p>
