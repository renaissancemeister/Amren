	<p>Milk from nursing mothers in Ohio and around the country is on its way to nourish sick babies in earthquake-ravished Haiti.</p>
<p>The Mothers&rsquo; Milk Bank of Ohio answered the call from a Navy doctor treating ailing infants on the USNS Comfort, a floating hospital docked off the Haitian coast.</p>
<p>The doctor requested the milk because it can help save lives, says Georgia Morrow, coordinator of the milk bank operated by Grant Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Breast milk contains antibodies that will help the babies fight infections, a common problem children face after a disaster, she explains. Breast milk also is safer option because, unlike some types of formula, it does not have to be mixed with water, she says. Clean drinking water is in short supply in Haiti.</p>
<p>The 500 ounces of frozen milk, which were donated by mothers from 12 states, will be transported by plane and helicopter to the ship. Morrow says she&rsquo;s not sure how long the milk will last, but says her organization will work with the other nine North American milk banks to keep the floating hospital stocked. Babies consume a teaspoon to a few ounces per feeding depending on their size, she says.</p>
<p>The banks typically provide breast milk, which can be frozen for up to a year, to babies in neonatal units in U.S. hospitals.</p>

		<p>I wonder how many cases there will be of this milk being rejected as &#8220;impure,&#8221; &#8220;spoiled,&#8221; &#8220;unfit,&#8221; etc.?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a video from CNN where Haitians are pushing and shoving women and children out of the way to get at an aid truck, then rejecting packets of biscuits because they think they are &#8220;too old!&#8221; (They were mistaking the manufacture date for the expiration date.) Even the black CNN reporter was getting disgusted.</p>

		<p> Would all these conscience-stricken White liberal women have been so quick to want their breast milk shipped off to, say, Argentina if it had suffered a natural disaster of the magnitude that Haiti did? No, of course not; the Argentines are White, so their problems are just their problems.</p>
<p> But when problems hit blacks, like in Haiti, ohhhh, they&rsquo;re OUR problems because we&rsquo;re to blame for all the Haitians&rsquo; troubles, yada, yada, yada &hellip;</p>
<p> In other words, this relief business works kind of like our welfare system. If you&rsquo;ve worked and made your own way, been prudent, provided for your old age, etc., you can&rsquo;t get federal assistance. But if you&rsquo;ve lived for the moment, squandered your money frivolously, racked up a criminal record, etc., then you are &#8220;the less fortunate&#8221; who have to be &#8220;helped&#8221; by the taxpayers.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of an article I read concerning the famine in Niger a few years ago. Aid workers were appalled to find the reasons for the extremely high infant mortality rates were due to: 1. New mothers were expressing their breast milk the first couple of days after birth and THROWING IT AWAY because they thought it was &#8220;bad&#8221; for the baby! The first milk produced has all the colostrum in it! That&rsquo;s where the anti-bodies are! 2. They refused to feed their children the fairly abundant chicken eggs lying around because eating eggs will make the children &#8220;grow up to be thieves&#8221;. 3. They didn&rsquo;t know how to grow or eat anything besides millet, 4. The men were hoarding all the food, leaving their wives and children to starve. The aid workers concluded their was no way they could &#8220;fix stupid&#8221;.  I feel terribly un-Christian for saying this, but White people should not help Blacks. It&rsquo;s a losing battle. </p>

		<p>I have no doubt anymore, that Multiculturalism is the state Religion: indeed, the one supreme religion of the Western World.<br>
Forget about Islam, or Christianity, as practiced by those of the Inquisitions. They are/were not as controlling or tyrannical.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism is a flat-out fire-and brimstone religion, and political correctness is it&rsquo;s &#8220;enforcer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ergo, we have idiotic white women giving their own body&rsquo;s milk (as an act of multicult piety and goodness) to black orphans abroad, whereas the  idea would never occur to them to do the same for a dying white kid down the block. No points in multicultural paradise for that, you see. No one to praise them, no way to feel holy or safe. <br>
I just had some Doritos&hellip;I glanced at the &#8220;Doritos recognizes people who DO SOMETHING&#8221; pablum blurb on the bag. I KNEW before I read it, that it would be about DIVERSITY. Sure enough, it&rsquo;s about a 22 yr old white girl who went to Asia to start an orphanage. If she did it in Arkansas or Connecticut, it wouldn&rsquo;t fit the state religion line, and would never be considered for a DORITOS ad&hellip;Frito-Lay wants to prove how holy it is. I&rsquo;m not joking at all. They know where the power is.<br>
 You see, you could swing a dead cat at random, and be sure to hit a sign, moniker, talisman, or proverb of Multiculturalism. It&rsquo;s everywhere. It is far, far more pervasive than any religious dogma ever was. I&rsquo;m serious&hellip;glance at the front page of every newspaper when you&rsquo;re at the grocery store.<br>
You&rsquo;ll either see pictures of Guatemalans, Mexicans or Blacks, or stories about them. Every story about schools is about closing despicable achievement gaps, and the head-scratching impossibility of the task. You&rsquo;ll see stories about immigrant crime, murder, drunk driving, with little or no mention of &#8220;immigrants.&#8221;  <br>
Every economic woe and societal blight in the Western world is directly  or indirectly connected to an exploding third world population in our midst -as indeed, our population grows almost entirely from their ranks- but &#8220;minorities (who actually make up 93% of the world&rsquo;s population), must NEVER be implicated. </p>
<p>We worship them, as saints of the religion, you see. Amazing, save for the fact that this is a Theocracy, and such inconsistencies in reporting and thought are NOT to be questioned. There are penalties to pay, like being, fired, ostracized, sued, jailed. Mark my words, one day the Catholic Church will excommunicate whites for racism.<br>
There is nothing in the world, but multiculturalism, the new great God.<br>
Again, I&rsquo;m not being facetious. <br>
Anyone else agree? Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Wrong. Colostrum contains antibodies, the first two days of milk, and even then it only contains antibodies for diseases the mother currently has a high antibody level for. I recently rescued a pregnant stray dog and had all these discussions with my vet. If this were about disease prevention they would solicit colostrum from third world countries that have similar diseases.</p>
<p>Saying breast milk is better because of contaminated water is silly, obviously it has to be refrigerated, screened and stored, the expense is outrageous and if they can refrigerate it they certainly would have access to clean water.</p>

<p>Not true. Breast milk can be frozen in special packages and stored for at last 60 days (could be longer, I&rsquo;m not sure) before use.  My daughter is the breast-feeding coorindator for a health dept. here in Tennessee and a strong advocate for breastfeeding.  </p>
<p>Those babies in Haiti will fair much better on breast milk than they will being fed formula.  Premmies, sick, malnourished and low-birth weight babies are prime candidates for breastfeeding.  </p>
<p>However, I will also add that when we send breast milk, we should also be sending shipments of reliable birth control.</p>

		<p>#3, I think the milk is usually compatible between races since slaves used to nurse the master&rsquo;s children.  I wondered, however, if any tests were being done to detect drugs, etc. in the milk sent to Haiti.  I thought too that it would be much more expedient to send formula.  No doubt, poor countries are accustomed to getting along with what they have.  Silly Soledad O&rsquo;Brien did a segment where she stood before an orphanage holding a can of powdered milk and declared that babies cannot drink milk reconstituted from it or they would all die.  Of course, some very young babies would not tolerate it, but how does anyone think the hardscrabble masses of Haiti survive?  </p>

		<p>There IS pre-mixed, or ready-to-feed formula on the market. It is more expensive than the concentrated or powdered formula, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be mixed with water. There is no earthly reason why this cannot be used in an emergency. The WHO has made it&rsquo;s mission to promote breastfeeding in third-world countries, up to the age of three years. Because of the water-quality issue, this is usually extremely good advice. However in the case of the disaster in Haiti, which has resulted in an extremely high number of infants being orphaned, it would seem preferable to give them pre-mixed formula them rather than let them starve. <br>
By the way, in actual fact, breastmilk is far less likely to cause allergies or colic. Human breastmilk is the food nature intended for human babies  &mdash;  no argument there. Is the high rate of HIV infection and AIDS the reason they aren&rsquo;t using already lactating mothers who are actually IN Haiti to wet nurse these  orphans? After a few weeks building up her supply, a good wet nurse can feed 3-4 infants apiece. If the surviving Haitian mothers aren&rsquo;t even willing to suckle their country&rsquo;s orphaned babies, maybe the U.S. needs to re-think this whole rescue effort. </p>

		<p>Milk from milk banks is screened for viruses and bacteria, so it should be hygienic.  Human milk is far less likely to cause an allergic reaction than a cow or soy protein formula would.  Sure it&rsquo;s safe.  A mixed race child has no problem nursing from its mother.  A different race child has no problem nursing from an unrelated women - just think of all the white babies fed by black wet nurses in times past.</p>
<p>What you think of this white on black altruism is a whole other issue.</p>

<p>I am as amazed as any at the lengths white females will go to feel the rush of psuedo-virtuousity through symbolically (at least) denying milk to their own babies to ship it off to nuture third world babies, who will also need more help later.  However, your medical alert in unfounded.  Wet nursing has been a practice since ancient times and no baby (to my knowledge) has ever died of the practice.</p>

<p>Because money and class has always divided peoples, including whites.  Also, it seems to be more exciting to people to rescue people in far away places that seem exotic (even Haiti) than to take care of our own.  Many a Pentecostal or Baptist mission can be found in third world countries, headed by evnagelist preachers who like to travel to exotic locales to preach to non-whites.  Also, I have always noticed the harshness of attitude toward the white working poor in this country.  It is even reflected in a current subtitle here on Amren.  This is why I often write that any whites who wish to organize for white racial survival are going to have to learn how to apply SOME of the principles of socialism to save the race.  All the others are doing it, whites had better wise up.<br>

		<p>500 ozs. milk will keep a dozen babies fed for less than a day and a half. The cost of sending it out by chopper whilst keeping it frozen would have paid for enough formula to feed them for a few months. Being constructive and realistic does not unfortunately generate  the feelings of heroic self-sacrifice the donors have managed to generate (for themselves only).</p>

<p>Yes, I think you pretty much have put your finger on it, Whiteplight. It,s &#8220;hip&#8221; to care about non-Whites in far-flung places, I suppose. Showing compassion to &#8220;White trash&#8221; (sic) would be too old-fashioned, and very politically incorrect, I guess&hellip;</p>
<p>You are also right when you say that Whites need to unite, and learn to equitably share some of our resources, instead of remaining a group of isolated individualists, before the Colored menace. We need to build new things together, rather than just compete for the biggest salaries and the flashiest muscle cars.</p>

<p>Fully agree!  Believe it or not quite a few babies are born allergic to milk!  This is a fairly common condition.  I was one of them and had to be put in a hospital for a month upon birth!</p>
<p>Nutty liberal Whites, in a frenzy of multi-cultural hysteria,  forcefully pouring milk down a black new-borns throat could actually end up killing them if they are allergic!  Nutty liberal Whites obsessed with diversity RUIN EVERYTHING and end up hurting Blacks and eventually in the long, Whites as well!</p>
