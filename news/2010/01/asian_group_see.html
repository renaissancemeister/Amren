<h1>Asian Group Seeks Federal Help</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dafney Tales, Philadelphia Daily News, January 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Asian civil-rights group filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice yesterday alleging that the school district acted with &#8220;deliberate indifference&#8221; to numerous complaints of harassment made by Asian students at South Philadelphia High.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, alleged that regular harassment preceded a series of attacks on 30 Asian students at the school on Dec. 3 and have continued even after the district instituted reforms in response to the incident.</p>
<p>Cecilia Chen, a staff attorney with the AALDEF representing eight of the victims, said that the events that day could have been avoided if school and district staff had responded effectively to previous pleas for help.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The complaint also states that the district and school failed to provide parents of bilingual students with pertinent information. In addition, the organization accused administrators of intimidation, saying that they ordered a student not to report discrimination and prevented teachers &#8220;from speaking out about the school&rsquo;s failure to address the harassment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The complaint asks the Justice Department to investigate the incident in the hopes that the department will recommend reforms on the school.</p>
<p>Chen noted that violence against immigrant students dates back more than a year. In 2008, a series of meetings between school-district officials, students and community groups followed a spate of violence against Asian students at the school, at Broad Street and Snyder Avenue. Chen said that promises made by the district to address the issue were never realized.</p>
<p>Throughout the day on Dec. 3, groups of Asian immigrant students were assaulted in and around the school by African-American students. In all, 13 students  &mdash;  six Chinese, seven Vietnamese  &mdash;  were treated for minor injuries. After the incident, 60 students staged an eight-day boycott of the school to protest what they said was the school&rsquo;s lackluster response to their harassment.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;&hellip;the district added security personnel and surveillance cameras, and began diversity training for staff and students as well as a conflict-resolution program. The district vowed to investigate; a report is expected to be released next week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Giving conflict resolution classes and diversity training to a black and expecting him to improve is a lot like expecting an alligator to stop attacking by yelling &#8220;BOO!&#8221;</p>
<p>I just imagine the corrupt media printed this story, because it was a non-white group and not whites who were victims of these blacks.</p>
<p>But, whatever, Asians are doing the right thing, because no one will lift a finger to try to prevent black harassment and violence unless it&rsquo;s going to cost them some big bucks or result in physical action against themselves.  I imagine that many of the administrators and teachers in this mostly black school are black and I&rsquo;ve never seen a single instance where they&rsquo;ve ever taken a black attack on any group seriously.  The Hispanics fight back, but no other group does.</p>
<p>Just having blacks around is distracting to other students&hellip;.white and non-white&hellip;who want to concentrate on learning.  Even without bullying and violence blacks are so disruptive they have no place with other races.</p>
<p>Blacks should only be among other blacks.  I&rsquo;m looking for some serious fighting to occur between blacks and other groups late this year or the first of 2011.  The economy will be in terrible shape by then, and there will be considerable tension between ALL the races in this failed empire.<br>

		<p>Blacks do not get along with any other race.  In California, Blacks have attacked, in turn, Whites, Jews, Mexicans, Central Americans, Lebanese, Palestinians, Arabs, Koreans, Chinese, Indians, Pakastani, and Iranians.  American Blacks also don&rsquo;t like Black Africans and Black West Indians.  At one-time-or-another, I have read news reports about each of the above ethnic students, shop-keepers, or immigrants being targeted by American Blacks.  In the case of shop-keepers, Blacks claim that the ethnic shop-keepers are &#8220;taking advantage of them,&#8221; by owing stores in or adjacent to Black neighborhoods.  During the L.A. riots, many of these stores were looted and burned.  Afterwords,the shop-keepers moved elsewhere, whereupon the Blacks complained that there were no stores in their neighborhood.   </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a step in the right direction but, if Asians have a &#8220;civil rights group&#8221; that represents their interests, then where is the civil rights group that represents the interests of the thousands of white children who are harassed, threatened and beaten by blacks every year?</p>

		<p>A physically aggressive generally non cerebral human specie attacking a more cerebral introspective human specie&hellip;.what would you expect putting them in the same environment? The ones who feel insecure in such a learning environment, physically attack the ones genetically designed to prosper in a learning environment,(Primitive Sociology 101). This is an interesting development because white students wouldn&rsquo;t have the privilege of legal representation in such a case of being systematically violated by blacks. Whites are only allowed to assist in their own replacement by non whites&hellip;.OR be compared to Good ol Adolf. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure making this statement is a necessary part of this attorney&rsquo;s strategy. But she is sorely mistaken if she believes what she said, which I doubt. Telling these blacks to behave and stop attacking these Asians would have had little, if any effect. They still would have attacked them.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;After the incident, 60 students staged an eight-day boycott of the school to protest what they said was the school&rsquo;s lackluster response to their harassment.&#8221;</p>
<p>How about a huge $$$ lawsuit against this school district, the school board, the school principal and the rest of the faculty? Being non Whites, these students would have a good chance at winning a big judgment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a step in the right direction but, if Asians have a &ldquo;civil rights group&rdquo; that represents their interests, then where is the civil rights group that represents the interests of the thousands of white children who are harassed, threatened and beaten by blacks every year?&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ole racist Whitey cant have an organization representing his interest. That would be racist. Until Whites as a whole grow a set, there is little that can be done. That is, little through LEGAL channels.</p>

		<p>The most amazing thing about this whole business is that the story was actually in the Miami Herald this morning. Usually the Herald would only print a  story where a black kid got beaten up by whites. These are very rare stories, but they get massive coverage. I expect to see this story in Amren, but to see it in a so-called mainstream media outlet is sort of interesting. </p>

		<p>  It should be up to local authorities to protect these students. Barring that, I think the East Asian students will have to form groups/organizations to defend themselves. I don&rsquo;t like it, but I don&rsquo;t like the Federal Government butting in either.</p>

		<p>I feel for the Asian students who are suffering from this.  I&rsquo;ve known many Asians for most of my life and the overwhelming majority are really nice and focused on career and stability.  I can just imagine some little Chinese kids or tiny Vietnamese kids suddenly put in a dangerous school full of ghetto thug types.  Imagine how you would feel in a similar circumstance.</p>
<p>Because the parents don&rsquo;t know how things work in America, having gotten their view of our country from TV shows full of white, suburban civilized people, they don&rsquo;t know that the cities they imigrate to are devoid of whites save for a few stragglers and some rural people (like me) who came for the good jobs that the cities cannot fill with unqualified locals.</p>
<p>There are a lot of Asians in my neck of the (concrete covered) woods, and they have clustered together for safety.  They have literally built a &#8216;fortress Asia&rsquo; section of this county where you see no blacks at all, save for those who come to the various public schools here and then go home at 3:00pm.</p>
<p>It is strange, however, that for most of my day, I am the only white, American Anglo Saxon male anywhere I go.  I am the extreme minority in a city of 7-8 million people!  I see many more white women that white males, and I never, ever see more than three whites together in one place, and that is a rarity.</p>
<p>Our future is of balkanized cities made up of latino, black and asian fiefdoms.  The whites will retreat to the extreme rural and cold areas that others don&rsquo;t like to go to.  I myself am thinking of buying some &#8216;refuge&rsquo; land out on the backwoods somewhere just in case.</p>

<p>Right. Such a large number of attacks all on the same day would suggest a racketeering conspiracy. Two or more persons conspiring to commit a crime. A mass attack against a group such as the Asian students by those of another race is grounds for a huge civil suit. And the damages would be three times those awarded for a similar crime that does not involve racketeering.</p>

		<p>Whatever we may think of Asians, they are doing the right thing here and forming groups that promote thier racial interests. </p>
<p>Heck, if their numbers grow they may even start fighting back physically against the black racists. Hispanics also tend to be physically small but they fight back against blacks when they have decent numbers.</p>
<p>Ever heard of white students staging a boycott or walkout over daily attacks by blacks? </p>
<p>There are a few pro-white (and non-Nazi) activist groups. Have they ever filed a complaint with the Dept. of Justice and started a media campaign to highlight black-on-white racism?</p>
<p>Face it - we do not even know how to play the race game in the new Amerika. Yes, the establishment is entirely against us. But it would be nice to have at least one white group or activist who at least tries to create something like the Asians - and all other races - have.</p>

<p>I agree. </p>
<p>And the reason blacks are treated as if they can do no wrong, when it is only them&hellip;mostly&hellip;.who do so much wrong, is because blacks represent a tribe in the empire that is on the verge of rioting at all times. </p>
<p>If whites were taking to the streets every time they perceived an injustice to them, I have no doubt there would be measures taken to try to prevent that and such measures would include chastizing blacks and placating whites.</p>
<p>Blacks, as a group, are the low tribe on the intellectual totem pole; however, they have the common sense to know that misbehavior and the threat of it reaps handsome rewards.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, as Angry Young Man said, most east Asians in the US do vote Democrat, even though it should be apparent that is not where their interests rest.  Also unfortunately, most whites in the US vote Republican, even though the GOP has repeatedly made it clear - through illegal alien amnesty votes and the like - that they despise us.</p>
<p>Voting is a strange phenomenon, and it doesn&rsquo;t look like a whole lot of logic goes into it, even from the groups whom one would expect to be the most sensible about these matters: whites and Asians.</p>

		<p>If these students were back in Asia they wouldn&rsquo;t be having these problems.   Mass immigration is the death of the native culture, people are fooling themselves when they believe that there are &#8220;good&#8221; mass migrations (the Chinese) and &#8220;bad&#8221; mass migrations (Haitians), both mean our death, even if the &#8220;good&#8221; migration puts a (very) few dollars in your pocket while you&rsquo;re waiting to die.  Both mass migration and black violence don&rsquo;t happen in a social and political vacuum,  they are both policies of the ruling liberal elite, both are designed to cow and ultimately eliminate first the political power of whites and then the physical existence of whites, and of the two the first program is by far the most destructive.   You can&rsquo;t blame the Asians for being ticked off,  but the spectacle of Asians organizing politically doesn&rsquo;t thrill me, and as several posters have already pointed out,  the ice-cold indifference of the system to us when we face similar situations just highlights our status as conquered natives in a colonial situation.  </p>
<p>Obama lost the white vote, even though we live in a country where no racial matters can be honestly debated and the concept of white interests is prohibited; it was indeed the immigrant vote that put him over the top.   As I said,  far more destructive.  </p>

<p>I think you have a point. This is a glimpse at the &#8220;new Amerika,&#8221; or of America as it will become.</p>
<p>As whites step off center stage as the majority in terms of numbers and in terms of being the prevailing culture, we will see what &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; really means.The leftist anti-racists imagine a post-white world full of racial harmony. They&rsquo;re in for a shock.</p>
<p>Imagine a future Multicultural America with large groups of very distinct ethnic and racial groups who have less and less in common with each other all competing for a share of the dwindling economic pie&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be ugly. There will be more of this interracial violence. Much more.</p>

		<p>I grew up in South Philadelphia.  I went to a Catholic primary and secondary school because the public schools were always and always will be dangerous and chaotic.  My mother worked for the public schools as a secretary and this did nothing but strengthen her conviction that her children would attend Catholic school.  The Vietnamese boat people started to arrive in the 70&rsquo;s, especially into our part of South Philly.  There were many small children and those who were unfortunate enough to go to public school soon faced the menace of &#8220;inner city youths&#8221;.  However, the vast majority of the Vietnamese just came from a brutal environment and in short order, the streets outside the school resembled a Bruce Lee movie.  It doesn&rsquo;t take much fighting back to keep these bullies from coming back.</p>

		<p>If blacks would stop shoplifting, looting and otherwise destroying property in major supermarkets there would be fewer reasons for Asian shopkeepers to &#8220;take advantage&#8221; of them. Better yet the Blacks could get the gumption together to open their own stores. </p>
<p>I think that just about every other ethnic group has found out what it is like to be around a majority of blacks. That is except Whites. When Blacks get around a 20% majority of a school there is going to be trouble. Personally I would get any child of mine out of a school where there was any more than 5% black. </p>

		<p>The real question is why are only White groups vilified in the mainstream media when they try to organize?</p>
<p>Without stocking the mainstream media with pro-Whites or creating our own mass media, there is no way the average White will know that he is not alone in the struggle.  </p>
<p>If he feels he is alone, he will not act.</p>
<p>In the case of the Asians, they may be able to organize a fierce defense of themselves.  The mainstream media does not jump all over them for standing up for themselves.</p>
