<h1>Haitian Siblings Survive Earthquake, Meet Their New Family</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<blockquote>
<i>[We urge readers to view the remarkable video accompanying this story below.]</i>
</blockquote>
<p>Dayana and Moise smile as they shovel chips, with a mix of sand, into their mouths on a beach in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p>
<p>They dig in the sand and run from the waves.</p>
<p>The Haehre family looks like any other family on vacation, but this unplanned trip to Florida was where their brood grew from two children to four.</p>
<p>Mindy and Oyvind Haehre started the process to adopt siblings Dayana, now 7 years old, and Moise, 5, from a Haitian orphanage in 2008. The adoption was to be completed next month when the family expected to move the children from a Port-au-Prince, Haiti, orphanage to their home in Loveland, Colorado.</p>
<p>But that orphanage partially collapsed in last week&rsquo;s devastating earthquake. All 25 children there survived, but they had to move out onto the street.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Haehres heard that Dayana and Moise might be among a small group of Haitian children whose adoptions were set that the U.S. military would fly to Florida. So they packed up their other two children, Silje and Jakob, and caught a flight to Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>On Sunday as they checked into their hotel, the phone rang. It was the call they were hoping for. Their children were indeed among the small group of children from the orphanage being evacuated to the United States.</p>
<p>The flight was heading for an airport in central Florida. The Haehres jumped in their rental car and drove about four hours north.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Big brother Jakob admitted he didn&rsquo;t enjoy the drive but said: &#8220;I was pretty excited. It was really fun to know that I can bring them home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dayana and Moise were already familiar with their new family. They had met in Haiti several times while the adoption process was slowly moving along.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Within probably 10 minutes all four kids were running around the customs area of the airport, playing and being noisy and acting like kids,&#8221; Mindy Haehre said.</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/world/americas/20orphans.html?hp">53 Haitian Orphans Are Airlifted to U.S.</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>James C. Mckinley Jr. and Sean D. Hamill, New York Times, January 20, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A group of 53 Haitian orphans landed in Pittsburgh on Tuesday morning, the first wave to arrive after the United States loosened its policy on visa requirements to expedite Americans&rsquo; adoptions of parentless children living in the post-earthquake ruins.</p>
<p>But the new policy, announced late Monday, affects only 900 children whom the Haitian government had already identified as orphans, and whom adoption agencies had matched with couples in the United States.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of children are believed to have been orphaned in the quake, and their fate remains unclear, aid groups and United Nations officials say.</p>
<p>Catholic leaders in Miami are pushing both governments to have children who appear to be orphaned airlifted to temporary group homes in South Florida. Several aid groups who focus on children, however, say every effort should be made to reunite them with relatives.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under the new policy, announced Monday night by the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, the United States is waiving visa requirements on humanitarian grounds for Haitian children already in the pipeline for adoption. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Homeland Security Department officials said they were walking a fine line, trying to let in bona fide orphans without opening the floodgates to all children who have been separated from their parents.</p>

If these children are being adopted by white parents, and we all know they are, there&rsquo;s going to be an angry backlash by blacks when the dust settles.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s evident to me is that these well-meaning people have never been exposed to race realism.  In their lifetime, they&rsquo;ve likely never heard of race realism. Any exposure to race issues they&rsquo;ve had was probably just sufficient and biased to convince them they are on God&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>Had they not been prevented from hearing contradictory argument, they would surely have had second thoughts.</p>
<p>Poor fools. </p>

		<p>Look for thousands of White couples to adopt these black kids now&hellip;it is the new trend&hellip;..brainwashed fools that they are.</p>
<p>Odd, that we never see a middle class or rich black adopt any of their own kind, isn&rsquo;t it? How about Oprah, Al Sharpton and the Obama&rsquo;s for starters? </p>

		<p>As horrible as this may sound I truly feel that whites who adopt black children are subconsciously the most racist.  These are probably the same people who refer to their dogs and &#8220;our children&#8221;.  I have always thought that to be a demented view.  A dog can be pet, a companion, a protector and a herder, but it can never be your child.  These demented souls who adopt black children are basically taking on a pet who can talk.  I am sure that is what goes on in the deepest recesses of their minds.  A normal person wants a child that is &#8220;theirs&#8221; genetically.  Which is why IVF services are such big business.  But these whites want a pet they can teach to speak.  I really think that there is something missing in their emotional makeup.<br>

		<p>Ever heard of a non-White person adopting a White child?  Whether or not &#8220;progressive&#8221; Whites care to admit it, the thought is disturbing.  Why is this cross-racial adoption phenomena endemic to Whites?  Are non-Whites to forever be our charge?  In all seriousness, do we think they are two-legged pets?  </p>

		<p>Their natural children will soon resent it as the parents tend to show preference for the adopted dark children inadvertently over compensating.<br>
Th National Association of Black Social Workers has made statements in opposition to whites adopting black children from U.S. and internationally. However they are keeping silent on this one.<br>
yes, lady, they are yours forever but they won&rsquo;t be children forever.</p>

		<p>These &#8220;adoptions&#8221; remind me so much of the word CUCKOLD and it is of course the Whites that are being cuckolded. ISTVAN is probably correct too, surmising that the deluded Whites want a pet they can show off and teach to talk. A cub male lion, no matter how well you treat it as it grows..it WILL become a 500 pound carnivore&hellip;it&rsquo;s in it&rsquo;s nature as becoming a criminal is in the Haitian&rsquo;s nature.</p>

		<p>7) Yes, we do.  However the smarter members of our race also realize they happen to be the kind of pet that bites the hand that feeds it.  The kind of pet you should have never adopted in the first place, and should rid yourself of at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>it seems pretty tragic and pretty typical. A guilt-ridden college-educated white girl pursued feminism and a career for years. She finally snags a nice white guy, a foreign engineering guy from Norway and gets married. She puts off childbearing until her eggs are almost all shrivelled up and dead. Lucky her, she manages to conceive twice, but the cost of treatment is huge and the toll on her dying womb is massive.  So she gets the bright idea to buy a baby to nurture and talks her white husband into it by playing on white liberal guilt (evil white folks are destroyers of the earth and must atone by raising brown babies, you know the drill).</p>
<p>So now she applies to adopt some Haitian kids (average IQ 70 or &#8220;mildly retarded&#8221;) and take then back to the nest, where they will become the big money sink year after year as they spend money on tutors and coaches in an ever fruitless attempt to get them performing above the pimp and piledancer level. The Norwegian grandparents are already disappointed, feeling no connection to the little cuckoo&rsquo;s planted in their son&rsquo;s nest, yet they will have to pretend for the rest of their lives. The two natural children will now get way less than half their parent&rsquo;s attention and will resent it, although their baby-hungry mom will dump a load of guilt on them if they so much as grumble, so they will learn to suppress their anger and resentment.</p>
<p>And the adoptees? With their limited IQ&rsquo;s, they will be lucky to pass for &#8220;dull normal&#8221; and more likely will wind up in special ed.  With luck, they will become completely oblivious to their inadequacies and limp through life living on perennial handouts from their adoptive &#8220;parents&#8221;. Worst case, they will develop a grudge against their white family and cultivate an outer attitude of sullen resentment, poisoning every family holiday for generations as a hell on earth of anger resentment and complaints.</p>
<p>So how far off do you think I am? </p>

		<p>13 Big bill: I think you are spot on.  Whites who are sick enough to adopt Haitians are abusing their own kids.  Luckily, the couple&rsquo;s real children are old enough to carry memories of how life was before the Africans came.  It&rsquo;s common for kids to resent a new baby that takes up mama&rsquo;s time, so they&rsquo;ll have no trouble discerning the obvious deficiencies of their new, genetically distinct, cellmates, regardless of what they&rsquo;re told to think.  How many posters here have only been awakened when they met Blacks eye-to-eye?  The real children be race realists from the start.  </p>

		<p>I would like to know what goes on in the minds of the children who have no choice in their adoption.  Whilst I commend the families for adopting a child, and helping a child from a foreign country who would never have such opportunity or freedom in their home country, I also wonder how it might feel for the children.</p>
<p>To come from utter poverty, in a country that has just collapsed, to arrive into a country where everything around you is different - cars, buildings, shops, TV&rsquo;s, etc, and then to be housed with 2 people that look nothing like you must be quite an alienating feeling.</p>
<p>No matter how loving and welcoming the new white families are, it will never replace the feeling or question of &#8220;beloning&#8221; to a family that looks like them.  Personally I don&rsquo;t really have  anything against intermarriage, but bringing in a child who looks utterly nothing like either parent must be quite strange. How would you feel if you were adopted by a couple who were a totally different race to you, no matter how loving they are? Would that ever lull the feeling of alienation? I can only hope that it is not an issue for these poor children. God bless them, and the people that families that adopted them.</p>

<p>Nicole Richie <br>
 <br>
Birth Date: September 21, 1981 / Age: 28<br>
Birth Place: Berkeley, California, USA</p>
<p>Biography: Nicole Richie (born Nicole Camilla Escovedo on September 21, 1981 in Berkeley, California, USA) is a socialite best known for her sometimes troubled friendship with heiress Paris Hilton. Richie is of mixed Caucasian, Black, and Puerto Rican heritage although Nicole has always been refered to as Black. </p>
<p>She is the biological daughter of percussionist Peter Escovedo III, (who himself is the brother of Sheila E), and a Black woman identified only as an assistant on African American Lionel Richie&rsquo;s 1980 world tour; Escovedo was a member of Richie&rsquo;s band. Apparently, Nicole&rsquo;s mother was never a factor in her life, and Escovedo raised her alone. <br>
