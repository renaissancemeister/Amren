			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maryclaire Dale, Los Angeles Times, January 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Supreme Court on Tuesday threw out a ruling that had set aside the death sentence of Mumia Abu-Jamal, convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer in a racially tinged case that has made the former Black Panther an international cause celebre.</p>
<p>The justices ordered the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia to revisit its 2008 ruling that Abu-Jamal deserved a new sentencing hearing because of flawed jury instructions at his 1982 trial. The Supreme Court pointed to its ruling in an Ohio case last week, when it said a neo-Nazi killer did not deserve a new sentencing hearing on those grounds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 3rd Circuit could still order a federal trial court to consider Abu-Jamal&rsquo;s case anew on other still-pending defense claims.</p>
<p>A mostly white Philadelphia jury convicted Abu-Jamal of killing white Officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981 after the patrolman pulled over Abu-Jamal&rsquo;s brother in an overnight traffic stop.</p>
<p>Prosecutors believe the 25-year-old Faulkner managed to shoot Abu-Jamal during the confrontation. A wounded Abu-Jamal, his own gun lying nearby, was still at the scene when police arrived, and authorities consider the evidence against him overwhelming.</p>
<p>Since Abu-Jamal&rsquo;s conviction, activists in the United States and Europe have rallied in support of his claims that he was the victim of a racist justice system. Abu-Jamal has kept his case in the spotlight through books and radio broadcasts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Abu-Jamal, a former radio reporter born Wesley Cook, has been on Pennsylvania&rsquo;s death row for about 28 years. Hundreds of supporters gathered outside the federal courthouse in Philadelphia when his latest appeal was argued in May 2007.</p>
<p>Bryan unsuccessfully argued for a new trial on grounds the prosecution improperly excluded blacks from the jury, made up of 10 whites and two blacks.</p>
<p>In March 2008, the 3rd U.S. Circuit upheld the first-degree murder conviction but found the jury instructions and verdict form flawed and agreed Abu-Jamal deserved a new sentencing hearing. The Supreme Court rejected Abu-Jamal&rsquo;s appeal of his conviction.</p>
<p>The issue over the instructions relates to whether jurors understood how to weigh mitigating circumstances that might have kept Abu-Jamal off death row. Under the law, jurors did not have to agree unanimously on a mitigating circumstance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But last week, the Supreme Court reversed a similar ruling from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. That case dealt with Frank Spisak, the neo-Nazi who killed three people in 1982.</p>

		<p>Whoa! This really surprises me. Usually when a death sentence is overturned, it is rarely reinstated. </p>
<p>This is such a travesty that this evil-doer Wesley Cook has been given the chances that he has. Such an open and shut case and yet it continues to draw &#8220;supporters&#8221; maintining that Cook is &#8220;innocent&#8221;. Even the brother of Cook who was at the scene of the crime will NOT support the man.</p>
<p>Justice delayed is justice denied is the adage. And HOW true. Officer Faulkner deserves much better.</p>
<p>And THERE WAS NOT A CONFRONTATION! The policeman was shot in the back coward-style by the C[r]ook. And none of this Abu this and Abu that stuff either. To me, the man is just plain ordinary Wesley Cook and always will be.</p>

		<p>So the death penalty was upheld! NOW this criminal gets to spend ANOTHER 278 years on death row!! What a joke! as much as I dislike the muslim world, I have to admit that I admire their immigration policies and the fact that one doesn&rsquo;t spend 30 years on death row, usually no more than 10 days after the death warrant is signed&hellip;seen it happen, wish it was so in the U.S.</p>

		<p>I always like the way Abu-Jamal is always referred to a &#8220;cop killer,&#8221; as though killing a cop is somehow more reprehensible than killing some unarmed joe-blow.</p>
<p>And if Jamal had killed the afore-mentioned &#8220;joe-blow&#8221; nobody&rsquo;d be yelling for his head, presumably because the cops &#8220;lay their lives on the line for us every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, please.  Being a cop is statistically far safer than most other outdoor jobs, such as roofer, painter, miner, sanitation worker, fisherman, electrician, construction worker, ag or bush-pilot, etc.  With over a million sworn officers of all types in the US, something like 130 died in the &#8220;line of duty&#8221; in the last year, which could mean anything from suffering a heart attack, being killed in a car crash, falling down stairs, choking on a donut, etc.  Only about 40-50 are actually killed in altercations with an assailant annually, probably making being a cop rather less dangerous than being just any civilian.</p>
<p>So if we want to string up this guttersnipe Jamal for murder, fine by me, but the fact that he&rsquo;s a &#8220;cop-killer&#8221; should be irrelevant.</p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve posted here before, Jamal acted as his own laywer during jury selection and removed two blacks from the jury pool. Now he wants a retrial based on the fact that there were &#8220;only&#8221; two black jurors at his trial.</p>
<p>One other thing: the Free Mumia movement has really jumped the shark. At one time he was supported by celebs like Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, the Beastie Boys, etc. Now all he has left are 1960&rsquo;s leftovers like Ramona Africa of MOVE and even Michael Moore admitted he was guilty.   </p>

		<p>Since the murder, this killer has now seen more years of life (all the while being the darling and toast of our enemies), for longer (28 years) than the entire total lifespan of his victim (25 years).  What an enraging injustice, even if the death penalty is finally properly carried out by the authorities.</p>

		<p>The main problem with the death penalty in the United States is that the perps die of old age before they get it.<br>
