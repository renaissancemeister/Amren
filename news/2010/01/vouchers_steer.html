			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Katy Reckdahl, Times Picayune, December 26, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While housing officials have for years touted the demolition of the public housing complexes as a way to &#8220;deconcentrate&#8221; poverty in New Orleans, a study released this week by the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center shows that public housing residents who use Section 8 vouchers are still likely to live in the city&rsquo;s most troubled neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Leaders in New Orleans had expressed hope that clearing most of the vast brick public housing communities would put an end to what a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development fact sheet described as &#8220;the old paradigm of concentrating families in islands of poverty.&#8221; Researchers believe that concentrated poverty isolates poor residents from opportunity and services, leading to higher crime rates, joblessness, failing schools and ill health. Brookings Institution analysts call this a &#8220;double burden&#8221;: Families with little money find their struggles exacerbated when they live in areas of concentrated poverty.</p>
<p>But whether former public housing residents find expanded opportunity in their new homes depends largely on the Housing Authority of New Orleans&rsquo; Section 8 program, because most of the city&rsquo;s former public housing residents either moved into remaining public-housing complexes or received Section 8 vouchers, which helps families pay rent for apartments secured on the private market.</p>
<p>HANO, which has been under the management of a new HUD &#8220;fix-it&#8221; team didn&rsquo;t attempt to defend itself, but instead said through new director David Gilmore that the voucher program at HANO &#8220;is, without question, broken.&#8221; The new team hasn&rsquo;t had a chance to fully examine the report, Gilmore said, but &#8220;if it is accurate, then it is further evidence of the problems within the (Section 8 voucher) program and the need to correct them.&#8221;</p>
<p>At HANO, like other housing authorities across the country, Section 8 vouchers have become the dominant form of housing assistance, taking the place of public housing. Twenty years ago, HANO&rsquo;s inventory included more than 10,000 public housing apartments in traditional complexes like the Desire, Florida, Fischer, St. Thomas and the recently demolished &#8220;Big Four&#8221;: B.W. Cooper, C.J. Peete, Lafitte and St. Bernard. HANO now has only one large traditional development left, the Iberville, where more than 300 of the 852 apartments are mothballed while a citizens committee weighs the complex&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>Instead, HANO now oversees 16,000 vouchers, nearly double its pre-Katrina totals.</p>
<p>This dramatic shift from public housing apartments to vouchers &#8220;put heavier emphasis on the Section 8 program,&#8221; making it more important to evaluate how well it&rsquo;s working and what can be done to make it better, said Kate Scott, interim co-director of the Fair Housing Action Center.</p>
<p>In an August report, the Fair Housing Action Center found that many New Orleans landlords refuse to rent to families with Section 8 vouchers. As an extension of those findings, the center, along with the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University, mapped two-bedroom apartments owned by &#8220;Section 8 friendly&#8221; landlords, which offered the rentals to voucher holders through listings maintained on the Housing Authority of New Orleans Web site.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The result: More than 60 percent of Section 8 apartments were in the two lowest-opportunity tracts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This is not a problem unique to New Orleans. Researchers and housing advocates have asked HUD to pay more attention to families who leave public housing and to modify Section 8 policies to more effectively help families move to better areas and to reach out to landlords with properties in better areas and maintaining their participation through efficient programs.</p>
<p>Scott believes that some of this can be placed on HANO&rsquo;s shoulders, because of its poor administration of the program. Landlords with better options have shied away from the program because it&rsquo;s been slow to pay rent and has a Section 8 staff that is &#8220;hard-to-reach, discourteous, slow and unhelpful,&#8221; according to the center&rsquo;s August report.</p>
<p>This makes it less likely for voucher holders to find decent housing in nice neighborhoods, Scott said, defeating the purpose of vouchers, which were designed to help low-income tenants rent property in safer, more moderate-income, racially diverse neighborhoods.</p>

		<p>I am not surprised because section 8 housing is usually located in poor neighborhoods. Most landlords do not want section 8 residents on their properties in better neighborhoods. They would be subject to inspections by HUD and make repairs that HUD demanded before they can rent their properties to a Section 8 tenant. Also they fear that renting to Section 8 tenants would lower property values in their community.</p>

<p>Where ever there&rsquo;s section 8, there&rsquo;s &#8220;islands of poverty.&#8221;</p>
<p>leading to higher crime rates, joblessness, failing schools and ill health. </p>
<p>Yep, that&rsquo;s what happens when sec. 8 comes to a &#8220;nice neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>isolates poor residents from opportunity and services.</p>
<p>opportunity = to rape, rob, assault, murder White folks.<br>
services = all the free stuff given to them by guilt ridden White folks in their new &#8220;hoods&#8221; to prove they&rsquo;re not &#8220;racisss.&#8221;</p>

		<p> Gee if I rent my nice apartments to section 8 housing I&rsquo;ll get a more diverse group of renters right up until I lose my current renters and end up a minority housing project with people who pay slowly and tear up my units. Hmmmm? No I think I&rsquo;ll just muddle through with my current renters thanks anyway.</p>

		<p>Housing policy has always been about jamming minorities into white neighborhoods (read E. Michael Jones&rsquo; &#8216;Slaughter of Cities&rsquo;). This was done by building tenements in white neighborhoods then telling blacks if they wanted free housing they had to live in one. </p>
<p>When Reagan came in he did not have enough muscle to do away with public housing entirely but he was able to convert much of the money to vouchers, so the tenants had some latitude about where to live. Not surprisingly most of them wound up living with people who looked like them. </p>
<p>Now some enterprising libtards want to &#8220;fix&#8221; it. </p>

		<p>I had a friend who landlorded for a time. He rented to anyone who seemed a potentially responsible tenant. White, black, or other, the criteria were about paying rent, and maintaining properties well.<br>
He got hammered by a lot of tenants (the ration of truly good to bad tenants is about 50/50, IF you do a reasonable job of screening-which consists of reading people well). <br>
 But the minorities were worse. Sad but true, they inflicted the worse damage, and never completed a lease without a dispute, trouble, suit/countersuit/etc. <br>
He tried hard to attract section 8 renters on the (partially faulty) premise that he could get the highest market rent for providing a great apartment. He found that section 8 recipients rarely had any understanding of how their rent was paid, so his higher rents scared them off. They didn&rsquo;t understand that the government footed most of that bill.  He had to explain the system to them, and their section 8 caseworkers always said the renters didn&rsquo;t understand how it all worked.<br>
Furthermore, he was scared off real quickly when he finally got a chance to interview section 8 renters; they were appallingly dumb, irresponsible liars who could not take care of themselves. Several of them admitted to having criminal/misdemeanor records for shoplifting, or stealing for employers. They rarely showed up for appointments to meet with him to see the apartments, and disappeared for days, without a call.  I&rsquo;m talking about able-bodied folks who were of at least normal intelligence. Well, relatively normal. <br>
He was so glad  that these prospective tenants blew it left and right, so he never had to consider them seriously. He never got skewered by them, or the government system that would have chained him down.<br>
It&rsquo;s a sucker&rsquo;s bet.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m white and have lived in section 8 housing. These areas were actually very nice, calm and peaceful. The landlords were intelligent enough to actively segregate. Across the street at another building - same complex, it looked like WWIII just started, abandoned, firebombed cars, all night parties with bass filled thumping music, cars tearing through their lot all night long. Fights, screaming and yelling. Our building, on the other hand, was always a very nice place to live. Section 8 has nothing to do with the issue, it&rsquo;s like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. When we hear stories like this, we need to be intelligent enough to discern reality from fiction.<br>
True not all poor people are scamming the government, many are. I&rsquo;ve met many minorities who are/ were, all of them whom I&rsquo;ve met as a matter of fact.<br>
If you&rsquo;re a minority, the welfare doors open.<br>
I personally know of one family, the mother gets her free welfare, housing, food, etc. Her husband works full time making nearly $20 an hour, her daughter and two sons work full time, all contributing to the household. They are quite wealthy, they have all new cars - 4 all together and two brand new motorcycles. The sons are now nearly 30 and were born and raised there. I&rsquo;m sure they will continue their free ride until the mother dies. They have a 3 bedroom apartment.<br>
In my experience section 8 means blacks, which means all of the above. Violence, a lack of police law enforcement, etc. In short, I wouldn&rsquo;t rent to blacks. When they cause a problem, kick them out, have monthly inspections. Have an on site resident manager - obviously not black - or they will be running some scam through the complex immediately.<br>

		<p>Not one word about the fact that the people who recieve section 8 specifically ask to live in those neighborhoods.  Why?  Two reasons.  The first is they hate whites.  The second is they want easy access to drugs and prostitution (either of these for consumption or to make extra money on the supply side).</p>
<p>And this is the real issue with regard to welfare.  Most welfare goes to fund a black market economy in drugs, guns, gangs and human trafficking.  Not some.  Not alot.  MOST.</p>
<p>Remember that the next time your politicians demand higher taxes to support social programs. What is that money really being spent on. Literally, the local gang organizes people to go get as much out of welfare as they can to provide&hellip;..rent, food, whole communities that serve them&hellip;.drugs, slaves etc.</p>
<p>The only way to really stop this is to make welfare illegal except for people who can&rsquo;t physically move around anymore (ie the elderly, bed ridden patients sipping meals through a straw).</p>
<p>Giving away free money has always been a bad idea.  Reform helped some but corruption makes sure the lions share still goes towards this and NOT toward taking care of &#8220;the poor&#8221;.</p>

<p>This is why I don&rsquo;t get worked up about the notion that the CIA is importing illicit drugs.  Even if it&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s no bother to me.  As you said, many users of these substances got the money to buy the drugs from welfare viva taxpayers.  Therefore, all the CIA is doing is recouping some of the government&rsquo;s own money to fund its black hat black budget secret projects.  Better that than the DoD hiding the CIA black budget behind $700 latrine seats.</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s all assuming that the original reports are true about the CIA and drugs, which they might not be.  I also noted that when they hit the papers, black groups had a villain to blame.  Rush Limbaugh&rsquo;s point was that this was the easiest conspiracy in the history of the world to defeat   &mdash;   All one had to do is to refuse illicit substances.  The CIA was an easy exculpatory target.</p>

		<p>Section 8 tennants usually inhabit a home for 10-24 months.  That is about the amount of time it takes for an adequate rental unit to become a pit of squallor. They know they can then move to another adequate home and repeat the process of squallorization.  The damage they cause in a matter of months is equal to fifty years of normal wear.  The front doors are always kicked in at some point within the first few months.  Ovens last maybe a year mostly due to excessive grease fowling the burners and being used as a heater.  Utility payments are often double a normal rate due to taking no measures to conserve.  Window screens, bifold doors and ceiling fans are immediately destroyed and discared within the first week. Every Section 8 tennant has a live in (usually the parent of the youngest illigitimate child and virtually never employed). The initial Section 8 inspection is so &#8220;white glove&#8221; than virtually no house can pass which requires waiting 1-4 weeks for a reinspection. If every white person in this country were forced to own and manage a section 8 property at some point in their early adulthood the welfare policies of this country would be vastly different.  You just have no idea until you see it up close. NO IDEA! </p>

<p>If he is making $20 an hour and if the entire family is &#8216;quite wealthy&rsquo;, than none of them needs to be on any form of government assistance.  That&rsquo;s like when I go shopping and see some poor, welfare client buying steaks and good quality meat while the hardworking person behind them can only afford cheap quality foods.</p>

		<p>I used to work with a woman who lived in a once upper-middle-class white neighborhood in a half white/half black city.  Naturally, there were similar neighborhoods that were black and integrated.  But this black woman who had won a large legal settlement chose to move into this all-white neighborhood.  She and her two grown sons often left the grass unmown and allowed a fallen gutter to lie where it fell.  She refused to pay the city for garbage collection and finally just stowed it in her garage, where rats soon gathered.  There&rsquo;s simply no denying the obvious when there are thousands more stories like this one.</p>

		<p>and has a Section 8 staff that is &ldquo;hard-to-reach, discourteous, slow and unhelpful,&rdquo; AND THIS!&#8221;, defeating the purpose of vouchers, which were designed to help low-income tenants rent property in safer, more moderate-income, racially diverse neighborhoods&#8221;</p>
<p>To begin with, the first statement would, in my experience, mean the staff is probably all black. The second statement would mean<br>
allowing the, mostly black, voucher carriers to move into those safer, racially diverse areas and turn them into ghettos. My experience suggests that &#8220;SAFER&#8221; and &#8220;RACIALLY DIVERSE&#8221; are mutually exclusive terms relative to anywhere blacks infest. </p>

		<p>Just as Section 8 &#8220;housing vouchers&#8221; are designed to use your tax $ to move ghetto thugs into white neighborhoods, so too are &#8220;school vouchers&#8221; designed for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Always remember this. Too many conservatives and libertarians support school vouchers. </p>
