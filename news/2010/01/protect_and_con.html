<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Our approach to bring protective clothing to the masses is unique. By enabling your protective vest to communicate with each other through messages like &#8220;Enjoy the game&#8221; or &#8220;Fair Play&#8221; we hope we can bring a new dimension to body armour. Our vest can be decorated with badges of your choice and we are open to your creativity. Design your vest now</p>
<p>We are seeing a high demand in personal protective clothing and there is no doubt that the risk is increasing at big events like the World Cup 2010 especially if you are travelling in areas where you are unsure about your personal safety. Read more in our security facts</p>
<p>PROTEKTORVEST will donate $1 per order to charities fighting against knife crime. Read more about our Charity Promise</p>

		<p>WHERE IN AMERICA CAN THESE VESTS BE PERCHASED?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Do they come in  children sizes too.  With the deterioration of American schools, workplace, and neighborhoods, every family needs a supply of these vests.   If they stop knives, they may also be good against sharp schrapnel from car bombs.  I want to buy several before they are outlawed.</p>
<p>Will Obama&rsquo;s Hitler Health Care pay for car bomb injuries?</p>

		<p>To repel knife attacks protective vests used in<br>
some sports might be suitable.  You can find them for sale by<br>
googling the term.  Also, try body armor. </p>

<p>Looks like they are going through with this madness after all. They deserve all that they are going to get. The ambush of Togo&rsquo;s soccer team in Angola last week has taught them nothing. (These Africans take their soccer seriously; and they play rough).</p>
<p>I live in South Africa. I have a strategy for the World Cup which I recommend to all.</p>

		<p>Like they won&rsquo;t just go for your face or neck?  And is this maybe  to be used in conjunction with groin-protectors and kneepads?  And don&rsquo;t forget the Achilles Tendons.  Otherwise, I don&rsquo;t see much point.  But then, pointlessness seems to be the hallmark of this millennium.  </p>
<p>Twenty years ago, you&rsquo;d only see something like this as a parody. </p>

		<p>One of the more popular &#8216;do your own designs&rsquo; is the one that has &#8216;free hugs&rsquo; written on it.<br>
A bit of ironic black humor or perhaps it&rsquo;s for the realist who hopes for the best?</p>
<p>I love Rugby union, but I would never risk my life or the possibility of my children being fatherless to go watch &#8216;a game.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I remember when there was those stories on the street clashes in Birmingham, England with Pakistani Muslims and the UDL(?) and when it was asked where are all the young White guys who should be there, standing up for the Veterans?<br>
The answer was that they were at a football game.</p>

		<p>Oh my goodness! The white visitors think they going to get stabbed! Noooooo! They are going to get shot, necklaced or going to become muti. (Necklacing is a petrol drenched tyre around the neck, victim set alight alive. Muti is when body parts are used to make medicine by the savage witchdoctors).<br>
We whites in this cuntry are giving you good advice: Stay away!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad someone from South Africa brought up the subject of necklacing. Will the media finally report it when hapless visitors, thinking South Africa is finally &#8220;all right,&#8221; go to the games and get burned alive?</p>

		<p>@ AnalogMan - glad to see a fellow Saffa on Amren, although I&rsquo;ve introduced quite a few of my friends to the site.</p>
<p>Since the WC2010 was handed to SA, we whites have been told in no uncertain terms that it is a black thing, with few or no opportunities for whites to gain anything from.</p>
<p>The Cup bid was based on infra-structure built by whites, and with our history of successsfully hosting the Rugby- and Cricket World Cups.</p>
<p>When Raymond Hack was sacked from Safa last week, any white involvement in the WCup was severed.</p>
<p>But mark my words : during the WCup, we whites will be accused of being unpatriotic for not attending these matches, and the white tax payers will have to foot the bill for this failure for many years to come.</p>

		<p>Remember what P.J. O&rsquo;Rourke once wrote about body armor.  Once you put on a bullet proof vest it is then you realize how much goes unprotected (such as your head, groin etc.).  Shame that the RSA has gone down the toilet with the rest of Africa.</p>

		<p>Reply to Fed Up:</p>
<p>You have no sympathy for any white person who visits any part of<br>
Sub-Saharan Africa?</p>
<p>But what about sincere white people who want to travel to Sub-Saharan Africa for a safari to see what remains of African wildlife?  Maybe you are saying this because you really wish you could travel to Kenya, Tanzania, and Botswana, but you do not have the time and money to do so.  In other words, maybe the real reason you are saying you have no sympathy for any white person who travels to Sub-Saharan Africa, is because you cannot afford to go on a safari, yourself.</p>
<p>However, I am well aware that most of Africa is not the safari wonderland the tourists go to see.</p>

		<p>I live in South Africa. The racist ANC &#8216;government&rsquo; largely ignores black on white violence, and it is violent. Rapes, murders and attacks merely because the victims are white and where nothing is stolen are common. </p>
<p>There should be no sporting contact with South Africa until the ANC drops its repugnant racist policies.</p>
<p>And, anyway, it&rsquo;s very unsafe to be a white here.</p>
