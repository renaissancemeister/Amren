<h1>Another Bad Idea: &#8220;Diversifying&#8221; Science Faculties</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Roger Clegg, Minding the Campus, January 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Should universities weigh race and ethnicity in deciding whom to hire for their science departments?</p>
<p>The American Association for the Advancement of Science thinks so, according to a recent National Journal article. &#8220;Science and engineering should look like the rest of the population,&#8221; says AAAS&rsquo;s Daryl Chubin, and if hiring decisions don&rsquo;t yield the right numbers, &#8220;somebody needs to pull the plug and say this has not been an open and fair search.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s clear that nondiscrimination is exactly what AAAS does not have in mind. The National Journal article says that it wants to &#8220;allocate additional slots to U.S. racial and ethnic minorities&#8221; and to protect universities from &#8220;likely lawsuits by groups seeking color-blind admissions policies.&#8221; As the quotes above suggest, it is demanding that schools get their numbers right. It wants quotas, it wants race and ethnicity to be weighed when hiring decisions are made.</p>
<p>And if race or ethnicity is weighed, then racial and ethnic discrimination is taking place. Let&rsquo;s have no nonsense about this not being so, since skin color or national origin is &#8220;only one factor.&#8221; Either that factor makes a difference sometimes in who gets picked or it doesn&rsquo;t. If it never makes a difference, then there&rsquo;s no point in considering it. If it does make a difference on occasion, then on those occasions someone is getting or not getting the job because of skin color or national origin. That&rsquo;s discrimination. Since we are dealing with scientists and not English majors, this kind of logic ought to be understandable.</p>
<p>{snip} The AAAS makes two arguments in favor of discrimination: that diverse &#8220;perspectives and backgrounds&#8221; are desirable, and that minority students need role models (&#8220;Students are helped by seeing teachers who are similar to them&#8221;).</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ll discuss, neither of these arguments is very persuasive, as a matter of law or policy. But even if there was something to them, is there enough to them to be worth all the costs? Here&rsquo;s the tab: Racial and ethnic discrimination is personally unfair, passes over better qualified candidates, and sets a disturbing legal, political, and moral precedent that such discrimination is no big deal; it creates resentment; it stigmatizes the so-called beneficiaries in the eyes of their students, colleagues, and themselves; it compromises the academic mission of the university and lowers the overall academic quality of the faculty, with predictable results in the quality of teaching and research; it breeds hypocrisy within the school; it encourages a scofflaw attitude among college officials; it mismatches professors and institutions, guaranteeing failure for many of the former; and it gets states and schools involved in unsavory activities like deciding which racial and ethnic minorities will be favored and which ones not, and how much blood is needed to establish group membership.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s predictable that the AAAS would try to justify faculty discrimination on the basis of &#8220;diversity,&#8221; since that&rsquo;s the justification for any academic sin nowadays and, as the National Journal article indicates, the AAAS believes that the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 2003 University of Michigan decisions have left the door open to this justification. {snip}</p>
<p>Nor have the federal courts done so. In the leading appellate case on the matter, Taxman v. Piscataway Township Board of Education, the en banc U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit refused to carve out a diversity exception for faculty employment discrimination under Title VII. The Fifth Circuit has ruled the same way, and there is no federal decision to the contrary.</p>
<p>{snip} The New Haven decision now further suggests that a university&rsquo;s track record of discrimination against, say, Latinos has to be so bad and so recent that, if it did not provide them a preference, there is a &#8220;strong basis in evidence&#8221; that it could be successfully sued for that failure  &mdash;  a very high bar.</p>
<p>So much for the law. Does discrimination in the name of diversity make sense as a matter of policy, in order to ensure a variety of &#8220;perspectives and backgrounds&#8221;?</p>
<p>Making the dubious assumption that one can and should make good guesses about life history and viewpoints based on an applicant&rsquo;s skin color and what country his or her ancestors came from  &mdash;  what in other, politically incorrect contexts is called &#8220;stereotyping&#8221;  &mdash;  it remains obvious that those are likely to be irrelevant in most jobs, and especially in the sciences. Perhaps being African American might give one insight into some subfields of, say, sociology  &mdash;  but inorganic chemistry or quarks or calculus?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another good answer to the claim that, all other things being equal, it&rsquo;s nice to have a diversity of backgrounds and experiences is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that all other things are never equal. That is, the choice is unlikely to be between two identically qualified candidates, one with a similar background to everyone else who&rsquo;s already on the faculty and the other with a dissimilar background. Rather, what the AAAS wants is someone to be picked even if they are less qualified (even if not completely unqualified).</p>
<p>We are always led to believe that race and ethnicity are simply being used as tiebreakers, but that&rsquo;s not true. It&rsquo;s demonstrably untrue in university student admissions, and there&rsquo;s little doubt that it&rsquo;s untrue with respect to hiring as well.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Why not pick the best qualified person, and teach them the cultural competence you think he or she may need, if you really think that your Puerto Rican physics and biology students will have a hard time understanding and dealing with non-Puerto Rican professors? Cultural competence, after all, is neither brain surgery nor rocket science. Rocket science, on the other hand, is rocket science, and brain surgery is brain surgery.</p>
<p>Turning to the role model argument, as a legal matter it is also a nonstarter. {snip} As Justice Powell wrote in Wygant [Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education], &#8220;Carried to its logical extreme, the idea that black students are better off with black teachers could lead to the very system the Court rejected in Brown v. Board of Education.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The law aside, it is ugly indeed to presuppose that one can admire  &mdash;  one can adopt as a role model  &mdash;  only someone who shares your skin color. Can a white student never look up to a black professor, or a black student to a white professor, or either one to an Asian or Latino or American Indian? Does this also mean that men cannot admire women, or a Christians admire a Jew, or the able-bodied admire someone in a wheelchair?</p>

		<p>Some years ago, the University of Regina (in Canada) enthusiastically hired a non-white woman for an engineering professorship position and fast-tracked her to tenure status. The administrators must have felt so proud of themselves, elevating a woman to the status of a tenured professor in a faculty where men predominate (and being non-white really helped her chances too).</p>
<p>Anyhow, to make a long story short, after all the students in her classes started complaining that she didn&rsquo;t know what she was talking about, the university finally researched her credentials a little more thoroughly and - surprise, surprise! - she didn&rsquo;t have any! Apparently, she had referred to holding the degrees and credentials held by her divorced husband!</p>
<p>This is what can happen when the desire to promote &#8216;minorities&rsquo; into prominent positions trumps any willingness to determine if the said candidates even have any idea of what they&rsquo;ll be doing and/or specializing in.<br/>

		<p>AAAS has to take this stance regardless of how preposterous and irrational it is, because they are rapidly running out of excuses for the &#8220;gap&#8221;. Sooner or later they, along with all the other backers of diversity and equality will have to acknowledge the obvious truth. </p>

		<p>Even the Soviets were sane enough to recruit the most qualified and pursue the winning ideas in their science faculties (except the life sciences, where Genetics was deemed politically incorrect). It would seem our society&rsquo;s degenerative PC disease must run it&rsquo;s course before we are cured. Ergo: expect planes and buildings to be destroyed not only because of third world terrorists, but also Affirmative Action engineers and scientists. Why not? America has already entrusted it&rsquo;s economy &amp; national security to a Frankenstein regime created by White Guilt. And what about computer technology &amp; the future safety of our pharmaceuticals? At least when stuff is made in China, one may assume Han Chinese did the work &amp; someone will be swiftly executed when a product is too glaringly defective. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Association wants less qualified, non-whites to be hired for university science departments.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s necessary to do this, because without policies like these the US will not reach third world status. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re moving nicely right now, but not &#8220;diversifying&#8221; under somne kind of AA where race and not qualifications are the most important factor, we might not be able to reach the goal of complete destruction of our first rate civilization.</p>
<p>Not implementing these kinds of unjust programs means it will take much longer for us to break apart into ethno/racial states.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Science and engineering should look like the rest of the population,&rdquo; says the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>
<p>That statement is suggestive of gross incompetence. Perhaps the most succinct definition of the large &#8220;achievement gap&#8221;   &mdash;  - that forbids such a result   &mdash;  - is furnished by Education Trust:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time [minority students] reach grade 12, if they do so at all, minority students are about four years behind other young people. Indeed, 17 year-old African American and Latino students have skills in English, mathematics and science similar to those of 13-year-old white students.&rdquo; (Closing the Achievement Gap, National Governors Association Clearinghouse, 2002, 9th paragraph) http://www.subnet.nga.org/educlear/achievement/index.html</p>

		<p>This is a red herring, because many high schools are going to take out their science labs, because minority students can&rsquo;t use them, as is happening in Berkeley, California.  Better to devote those resources in teaching 17-year olds how to read, write and do arithmetic so that they might go on to &#8220;college&#8221; and increase the school&rsquo;s tertiary matriculation stats.  </p>

		<p>Post-1965 immigration policy is radically changing the racial composition of AMERICA. Why should NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS be in favor of this. Of course,  when LEGAL IMMIGRATION changes the racial composition of AMERICA non-whites will  have the political power to drive NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS out of high-skill occupations. So the the obvious question arises:Why reduce NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of AMERICA? </p>
<p>As I write this post, I am watching a rebroadcast on the Science channel of the history of the American space program. This is a ten part series. The American space program was completely WHITE-the engineers,rocket scientists and technicians.As you all know, the foriegn rocket scientists were German immigrants. There were no hindus and chinese in the NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN SPACE PROGRAM.</p>
<p>Daryl Chubin is a bold-face liar. He is an immigration enthusiast who harbors malignant intentions towards the NATIVE BORN WHITE MAJORITY.</p>
<p>Immigration Enthusaist despise NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS because&hellip;NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERIANS put twelve Alpha WHITE MALES on the moon. </p>
<p>DO NOT ACCEPT THESE BOLD-FACE LIES ABOUT NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS.</p>

		<p>Comrade Chubin notes in the above article:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody needs to pull the plug and say this has not been an open and fair search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughing hysterically in utter abject disgust!</p>
<p>Indeed Comrade Chubin, the plug should be pulled, but not on the current levels of whites in sciences and engineering; it needs to be pulled to drain away the fallacious swamp of multiculturalism. After that, the basin should be meticulously disinfected of all traces of this psychedelic vestry that remains. Including fools like you, Comrade Chubin.</p>
<p>As the author of this piece observes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps being African American might give one insight into some subfields of, say, sociology &mdash; but inorganic chemistry or quarks or calculus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t and in fact, even in the &ldquo;social sciences&rdquo; or behavioral sciences, &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; only offers a twisted politicized perspective. How much worse is this when applied to hard science, where research leads to technological innovations and developments that can put an entire society at risk in terms of losses and benefits? I would hold that it is an abomination against reason, not seen since troglodytes would throw rocks at the moon &ldquo;demons&rdquo; to please their sun &ldquo;god,&rdquo; so as to have an increased harvest. </p>
<p>Or put another way, there is no Afro-centric or Muslim-oriented way to split an atom, or calculate the time-space continuum. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>The standard leftist answer to such criticism of affirmative action is to bring up &#8220;historically disadvantaged groups&#8221;.  What they fail to consider is that we&rsquo;ve now had at least 50 years that white males have been the primary disadvantaged group.  Most Americans are not even old enough to remember a time when white males were not disadvantaged; the anti-white status quo is all they&rsquo;ve ever known.  The fact that there still are many white males in important positions is not evidence that whites have the upper hand; whites continue to achieve IN SPITE of a system rigged against them.  Not BECAUSE of a (non-existent) system rigged in their favor.</p>

		<p>J. Philippe Rushton could easily explain why there are so few black scientists but of course no one in the politically correct AAAS will be willing to concede to his arguments, or for that matter, even permit him to state his case in a public forum.</p>
<p>They are also hypocrites.  You cannot deliberately increase the proportional representation of one group without also deliberately decreasing the representation of some other group.  So which group will it be?  If the advocates of diversity were consistent they&rsquo;d try to reduce whichever group is most severely overrepresented relative to its percentage in the overall population.  That group would be Jews.  Anyone who has ever worked in physics, mathematics, or other hard sciences knows that a great many of the people in those professions are Jewish, far more than their 2% proportion of the population.  (News flash, there are many smart Jews.)  So the good liberals of the AAAS should insist upon imposing quotas on Jews.  But they won&rsquo;t.  They&rsquo;ll just squeeze out the white gentiles, as usual.</p>
<p>As others have pointed out, innumerable Indians, Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans have had no problems surmounting the vast sea of &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; that supposedly keeps non-white people away from research careers.<br/>

		<p>as a former lifelong race difference denier, I can testify that all white intellectuals secretly know the truth.</p>
<p>as wave after wave of immigrants arrived penniless in the US and struggled toward success, blacks &amp; hispanics have remained stationary or regressed. </p>
<p>we all know why, we have all always known why, but denial is a powerful force. </p>
<p>someone should do a survey: how man rich white families who trumpet race quotas &amp; lib causes actually hire black/hispanic architects to build their homes, send their kinds to black/hispanic doctors, hire black/hispanic lawyers to handle their estates, black/hispanic investors to handle their portfolios??</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, the dumbing down of science faculty in the US won&rsquo;t really matter.  White, US-born students know full well that high-tech industry has been refusing to hire white, US born scientists and engineers so long as congress has made cheaper H-1bs available, so there is no incentive for them to study these fields in college.</p>
<p>What the US is doing via the H-1b visa program is already permanently destroying its scientific and engineering lead; turning university science departments into sandboxes for unqualified Diversitoids to play in won&rsquo;t make things worse.<br/>

		<p>What Matt, in comment 2, related regarding a woman who was expressed into tenured status in an Engineering department<br/>
despite bogus credentials rang a bell. I was for some<br/>
years on the faculty of an urban university that<br/>
hired a black woman to join one of the Humanities departments.<br/>
After a year or so, complaints about her vagueness as a teacher<br/>
inspired investigation of her qualifications. It turned out that<br/>
she had falsified her CV. Properly, she should have been fired.<br/>
She was given tenure.</p>

		<p>The almost total absence of multi-culti names in the scientific literature is keenly felt by those propagating the changes outlined here.</p>
<p>South Africa is more advanced in this deceit, and white scientists are asked to &#8220;collaborate&#8221; more with unqualified underlings.  The idea, of course, being that their names will at last appear in peer reviewed articles.</p>
<p>Just another dishonest short-cut to achievement that is so seriously lacking.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The AAAS makes two arguments in favor of discrimination: that diverse &ldquo;perspectives and backgrounds&rdquo; are desirable, and that minority students need role models (&ldquo;Students are helped by seeing teachers who are similar to them&rdquo;).&#8221;</p>
<p>1. &#8220;Diverse perspectives and backgrounds&#8221; make little difference in the natural sciences, mathematics or computer science. 2 + 2 = 4 no matter what your skin color is or how difficult your upbringing was.</p>
<p>2. One could make an equally strong argument that minority students can benefit most by having white science teachers as their role models.</p>
<p>After all, if millions of white kids are encouraged to idolize Michael Jordan, then what exactly is wrong with black science students being encouraged to emulate their white teachers? If we want them to succeed, shouldn&rsquo;t we encourage them to follow the example of successful whites?</p>

		<p>Wherever I go in the States, I see the most outrageous examples of the most blatant discrimination. Despite the most stringent legislation to prevent discrimination against the handicapped, not a single member of this poor maligned community has ever been signed up for any of the major NBA teams. I feel this could well be the tipping point, once they are admitted I am sure academia will be only to eager to follow suit. At least the government is in the lead in this area, they have admitted an unduly large proportion of the mentally handicapped into the house and senate.</p>

		<p>To Bobster:</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, those buildings in Haiti were designed by Afro-Haitians. Remember, Dessalines evicted all the whites in Haiti by 1804. So, these buildings are an example of black urban cosmopolitanism, in Haiti.</p>
