<h1>MIT Lags in Hiring, Promoting Black, Hispanic Faculty, Internal Report Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tracy Jan, Boston Globe, January 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MIT must do a better job recruiting and retaining black and Hispanic faculty, who have a significantly more difficult time getting promoted than white and Asian colleagues, according to a frank internal study released today by the university.</p>
<p>In some departments, such as chemistry, mathematics, and nuclear science and engineering, no minorities have been hired in the last two decades, according to the report, which was more than two years in the making.</p>
<p>MIT&rsquo;s first comprehensive study of faculty racial diversity and the experiences of underrepresented minority professors highlights a national problem across academia: the need to improve the pipeline of black and Hispanic scholars.</p>
<p>Blacks and Hispanics make up only 6 percent of MIT faculty, an increase of 4.5 percent since 2000 but far below the university&rsquo;s goal of achieving parity with the nation, where underrepresented minorities make up 30 percent of the population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hockfield [President Susan Hockfield] plans to share the report over the next several days with peer research institutions in the hopes of establishing closer ties that will help with producing a greater number of minority engineers and scientists.</p>
<p>The report recommends that MIT expand its recruitment efforts beyond the small number of schools such as MIT, Harvard and Stanford from which it tends to draw many of its faculty.</p>
<p>Senior professors from underrepresented groups told researchers that they feel less satisfied with MIT than their white colleagues and expressed greater concerns about objectivity in tenure and promotion decisions. In many cases, they also expressed frustration with regard to isolation and climate, the report said.</p>
<p>The report suggests that MIT address the issues of climate with more open discussion about diversity and its connection to excellence  &mdash;  something faculty surveys indicate that many white professors do not believe.</p>
<p>&#8220;These issues become difficult to address because of a general discomfort in openly discussing matters of race in the academic setting of MIT,&#8221; the report said.</p>

<p>I got my PhD from a major research university.  If a job candidate was white, his or her university and academic record (peer review publications in top journals) were relentlessly scrutinized.  If it was a black, they could get to give a job talk having gone to a second rate university and they could have a lack of publications.  The professors  &mdash;  almost all liberal and in the social sciences  &mdash;  did not like that, but they were under university dictate. </p>
<p>&#8220;The report suggests that MIT address the issues of climate with more open discussion about diversity and its connection to excellence &mdash; something faculty surveys indicate that many white professors do not believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>I absolutely believe white faculty do not think there is a connection between diversity and excellence.  They think it&rsquo;s an inverse relationship&hellip;and they&rsquo;re right.</p>

		<p>What MIT needs are departments of sociology, African-American studies, critical race theory and education.  Then, they can have more blacks on the faculty.  It might seem weird to have those departments at a school whose focus is hard sciences, math and engineering, but you gotta do what you gotta do for diversity, right?  </p>
<p>What they must not realize at the Globe is that MIT, Harvard and Tufts have cross-registration.  Therefore, if an MIT student needs his or her diversity, then he can sign up for one of Cornell West&rsquo;s classes at Harvard.</p>

<p>I just read a news story that said they were trying desperately to keep from cutting people and subjects on account of a lack of funds.</p>
<p>Where are they going to get the money for this extra curricula activity, especially since they will be in a worse financial bind next year and the year after&hellip;.and the year after that&hellip;.and&hellip;.?</p>

<p>Not a surprise given the taboos against honest discussion of race in public in our society.  Given the latest Harry Reid incident, it appears that the taboo now extends even to private discussions.</p>

<p>At one school of my acquaintance, an African applied for a position for which he lacked the qualifications. The academic dean then created a special position just to hire him (we had a choice  &mdash;  hire him or not hire anyone, the latter would make us look racist  &mdash;  and we still got to hire someone for the original position who was qualified). Interestingly, there was no opening of the position to get the BB (Best Black).<br>

		<p>CAPITAL IDEA!  I think it brilliant that the report recommends expanding recruitment beyond Harvard, Stanford, and MIT.  In fact I just did a search, hoping to see whether Tuskeegee offers doctorates in such things as Nuclear Science. That was inconclusive.  But I did notice that The University of Phoenix, as well as other respected institutions of higher online learning, seem to be offering doctoral degrees, these days.  </p>
<p>Perhaps President Susan Hockfield can share the report with The University of Phoenix, in order that they and MIT might &#8220;establish closer ties that will help with producing a greater number of minority engineers and scientists&#8221;.</p>

		<p>MIT just needs to do what all the other major universities have done, i.e. create a &#8220;black studies&#8221; of science chair, install some noisy blaggards (like Henry Gates and Cornel West) in a half dozen sinecures, and tada!</p>
<p>Then these newly minted professors can all discuss with great seriousness how blacks invented the cell phone, taught us how to use the peanut and performed the first open heart surgery. https://www33.brinkster.com/iiiii/inventions/</p>

		<p>I wonder what the ethnic composition of India Institute of Technology (IIT)is compared to MIT, the university at issue.  How many white, African, Chinese and Japanese are full-time professors at IIT.  I&rsquo;ll bet the Indian students at MIT are quietly giggling up their sleeves at their host diversified institution compared to their IIT that is churning out top-rate technology grads.  They have their cake and are eating it too.</p>

<p>Recruiting is one thing. Retaining is another.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the problem with retaining? Are they leaving because they get better offers from better universities or are they found to be unqualified to teach?</p>

		<p>I have posted this before, but why does the Hispanic segment require special care and feeding? I do not support special treatment for Women and Blacks; however it is a fact that that these two groups can claim a long history of legal discrimination. Hispanics have not been subjected to these conditions. I don&rsquo;t remember any discussion about giving Hispanics preferencial treatment. I do remember such discussions concerning granting these benefits to  Blacks and Women. </p>
<p>Perhaps, it&rsquo;s part of the transition from Affirmative Action to Diversity. First it was temporary help for groups who had suffered past injury; now it has become permanent benefits to everybody not a rich White man. </p>

		<p>Chemistry, mathematics, nuclear science and engineering are disciplines which require a lot of logical thought and problem solving skills, of course. Is anyone here surprised that in all 50 states and D.C., Bantus and mestizos lag in reading, science and mathematics test scores? And they expect more faculty in these disciplines to be hired?</p>

		<p>Question Diversity is correct: high-profile universities quarantine incompetent blacks in &ldquo;African American Studies departments&rdquo; (the Cornel West syndrome) in exchange for the right not to hire and teach incompetents in other departments. I earned my Ph.D. at an Ivy, and there were zero blacks or Hispanics in my department. Once in awhile, we scolded ourselves ever critically and halfheartedly for not recruiting blacks and then went back to business as usual (meaning cutthroat competition based on cognitive ability). In many humanities departments at my university, high caste and often incredibly wealthy Bengali and Indian elites served as token &ldquo;people of color&rdquo; – which was ironic, because they were essentially the Rockefellers and Mellons of their home countries, and could barely bring themselves to look at or speak to upper-middle-class white Americans, whom they regarded as almost less than human (just try to imagine what they thought about black people).</p>
<p>MIT has long been crammed full of talented Indians and Pakistanis, so they too have benefited from an elastic definition of &ldquo;people of color.&rdquo;<br>
When the rubber hits the road and blacks demand inclusion, the real problems began, because the number of qualified blacks is infinitesimally small – I&rsquo;m pretty sure there are more Korean concert pianists living in the United States than blacks with SAT scores to qualify for Harvard.</p>
<p>Having survived this cynical charade, all I can say is: <br>
no matter how much they protest, gasp in horror and fainted away when you mention racial differences in IQ, etc., <br>
EVERY SINGLE PERSON WITHOUT EXCEPTION who participates in this mockery is deliberately and consciously lying every minute of every day. </p>

<p>Meaningless statistics since underrepresented minorities probably make up about 0.06 percent of the qualified pool of applicants seeking professorships at MIT. How many blacks even actually acquire PHDs in the maths and hard sciences every year? The number can&rsquo;t exceed the low hundreds.</p>

<p>Yeah, the private sector is doing all the can to hire any available minority, too.</p>
<p>Reminds me of universities fumbling over themselves fretting about the lack of non-whites while ignoring Historical Black colleges and Their recruiting drives going on at the same time. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s funny.  I always had this strange idea that getting and keeping a job of any kind was the responsibility of the person who <i>wanted</i> the job, not of the institution doing the hiring.</p>
<p>Just how &#8220;frank&#8221; <i>was</i> this &#8220;internal study,&#8221; anyway?  Oh, wait   &mdash;   &#8220;frank internal study&#8221; is the latest Newspeak neologism for &#8220;PC hand-wringing manifesto,&#8221; isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>If blacks and mestizos are having &#8220;ignificantly more difficult time getting promoted,&#8221; at such a flagrantly PC university, it can only be because they haven&rsquo;t <i>earned</i> promotions, as their White and Oriental colleagues have.</p>
<p>Of course, only a Racist would dare to suggest that the emperor isn&rsquo;t wearing any clothes, and being called a Racist is the worst thing in the world, isn&rsquo;t it?  </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it?<br>
