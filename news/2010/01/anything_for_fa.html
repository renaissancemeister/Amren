<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The desire of Saudi women to have fair skin, a basic parameter often used to decide levels of beauty in these parts of the world, drives many women to purchase skin-lightening cosmetics.</p>
<p>It is with the aim of looking beautiful that Saudi women have recently, through SMS messages and the Internet, begun promoting placenta injections which can cost around SR30,000 per session.</p>
<p>While the US Food &amp; Drugs Agency (FDA) has forbidden the sale of capsules and herbs made from placentas, Jahid Al-Hashshan, director of licenses at the Saudi Food and Drugs Authority, did not dismiss the possibility that products made from placentas might be on sale in the Kingdom. &#8220;Material containing elements of placentas might be registered for other uses,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Although cosmetics entering the Kingdom are subject to strict controls and checking to ensure they are according to Saudi specifications, smuggling them into the Kingdom is not impossible,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Having a fair complexion is a sign of beauty for many people in this parts of the world, even though many international icons of beauty  &mdash;  such as the supermodel Naomi Campbell and singer Beyonce  &mdash;  are not white. Traditional Arabic proverbs demonstrate how the idea that beauty lies in being fair is entrenched in the psyche of many people. &#8220;I wish I was white and crippled because white is something to see,&#8221; goes one famous Saudi saying.</p>
<p>According to psychiatrist Fawziya Ashmakh the above saying is far from accurate but also &#8220;shameful.&#8221; &#8220;It is an exaggeration,&#8221; she said, adding that she believes a change in culture has greatly contributed in changing the stereotypical view of what beauty is.</p>
<p>&#8220;The passing of generations and change in tastes have led to a reshaping in how beauty is measured,&#8221; she said, adding that the media  &mdash;  both Western and Arab  &mdash;  have been instrumental in constructing the idea that fair equals beauty.<br>

								<h2><a href="https://www.stylelist.com/2010/01/18/lightening-creams-could-be-dangerous/">Skin Lightening Creams Could Be Dangerous</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Grace Gold, StyleList, January 18, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>If you&rsquo;re smoothing on lightening creams regularly, you could be risking the health of your skin.</p>
<p>The New York Times profiled 45 year-old Brooklynite Allison Ross, who has used lightening creams like Fair &amp; White and Hyprogel for years to brighten the shade of her face, neck and hands.</p>
<p>But in addition to being lighter, Ross&rsquo;s skin now bruises at the slightest touch and is etched with persistent acne and red capillaries  &mdash;  all of which her doctor attributes to the side effects of undisclosed prescription-strength steroids found in the over-the-counter creams she has used.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In countries running the gamut from the Philippines to India to South America, lightening your entire face or large areas of your body is a common goal, where people often see it as a way to climb up in social standing. And in these countries, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for women in the marriage market to be valued more &#8220;highly&#8221; because of a lighter complexion.</p>
<p>Just this past Fall, Dominican-born Chicago Cubs baseball player Sammy Sosa showed up at the Latin Grammies with skin lightened by several shades. Sosa admitted to using creams to lighten his skin as well as getting bleaching treatments.</p>
<p>But now doctors across the United States are seeing an increase in the number of patients suffering from unsightly skin lightening side effects.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s happening more because the Internet has been a great source for these patients to get physician-strength or prescription-strength products,&#8221; says Washington D.C. Dermatologist Eliot F. Battle Jr. &#8220;The patients are Ph.D.&rsquo;s to women from corporate America, teachers to engineers  &mdash;  the entire broad spectrum of women of color,&#8221; Dr. Battle added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The best way to protect yourself? Don&rsquo;t purchase skin lightening creams without the detailed instructions of a board-certified doctor who will be able to safely guide you on exactly what you should buy and how you should use it.</p>

		<p>The quest for and high value placed upon white skin has been noted throughout the centuries and cultures by many historians, including a more recent book by Thomas Sowell.  It is not a creation of racist white society, but a feature of each country and culture, and India&rsquo;s caste system and skin color code long predates English colonialism.  The whole concept of light vs. dark is culturally based; for an interesting insight into this phenomenon in the Caribbean, there&rsquo;s a link in today&rsquo;s Steve Sailor post at VDare regarding the deliberate &#8220;lightening&#8221; of the population of the Dominican Republic.  From there there&rsquo;s a link to a thread about Rihanna, with many chiming in that those who consider themselves white in the islands are described as black in the U.S.  But then, isn&rsquo;t that what they all want?  Aren&rsquo;t we all supposed to be some shade of brown and then we&rsquo;ll all be equal the way the liberals and cultural diversity mavens so devoutly hope against all history and reason?  I guess I&rsquo;m just too ornery to go along with their plans, and will continue to use SPF 75 to prevent sunburns endemic to my socially-constructed (as opposed to scientifically real) race.</p>

		<p>I know I have said this before but so called &#8220;people of color&#8221; are about the most racist people on Earth. The lighter your skin is the more beautiful you are considered and these beliefs predate much of the contact with Europeans. Many Whites still damage their skin horribly with tanning, both indoor and outdoor, I have sun damage to both my face and neckline from constant sun tanning as a young person. </p>

		<p>I hadn&rsquo;t known anything about the Sammy Sosa skin thing.<br>
Upon checking it out, I find it is getting quite a lot of attention.  <br>
<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/07/sammy-sosas-skin-photos-p_n_349602.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/07/sammy-sosas-skin-photos-p_n_349602.html</a></p>
<p>Let me point out this particular delightful tidbit from the article, something that is always de rigueur   &mdash;   from white people at least, so I guess that makes Sammy now white:</p>
<p>ESPN notes that Sosa also remarked, <i>&#8220;I am not a racist.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Of course you&rsquo;re not Sammy. You just think white is better, that&rsquo;s all.</p>

		<p>You need light and dark tones existing together to create contrast, which makes highlights that draw the eye.<br>
When you&rsquo;re looking an object devoid of illumination, which consists of nothing but the same harsh flat shade.<br>
There is nothing to look at but the shape(s) of the silhouette, which is a whole different aesthetic in masculine and feminine form.<br>
Less detailed visual information is conveyed and &#8216;you are left in the dark.&rsquo;<br>
In other words, the shadier, blacker or more opaque something gets it becomes dimmer, duller and more is concealed (less trustworthy?), which of course is less attractive to most. <br>
&hellip;.Erh, visually speaking of course.  </p>

<p>It is the equivalent of saying &#8220;I would give my right arm to be white&#8221;. Better to be white and crippled than dark and ambulatory.</p>
<p>Anglokraut wrote: <i>Why? Women have to be covered head to foot in public, so who is going to see it?</i></p>
<p>They have private social lives where they dress in western clothes and wear makeup and such, they just don&rsquo;t do it in public. Clothing, makeup, and accessories are a big deal over there especially for middle and upper class women.</p>

		<p>I guess being White and somehow disabled is preferable to being dark skinned. In Saudi culture any disability, especially among women, is immediatly a disqualifyer for marriage, a decent job or anything other than begging. Also in Saudi Arabia the official executioner is a black man who is a former slave. </p>

		<p>Amazing!  To the darker hued people of the world, the white race is most evil, filthy, and vile.  The white race is responsible for the vast majority of civilization in the world, not to mention abolishing slavery.  Other cultures are touted as equal or better to that of Caucasians.  In many instances, the darker ones would love to annihilate us and our culture altogether.  Yet, if we disappeared from the face of the world, what would they have?  All this hatred, yet they want to look more like us.  It is nothing but deep seated envy and jealousy.</p>

They hate us because they want to look like us, become as capable as us, but are not and that makes them angry. They cannot become us, they do not have our genes.<br>
I sometimes believe that the best and ultimate solution to the racial problem is the complete isolation of the White world from the non-White world (except maybe some contact with native Americans in North America. Maoris in New Zealand and some East Asians). So much isolation, that the common people in both the &#8216;worlds&rsquo; would not even be aware of each other&rsquo;s existence. </p>

		<p>Want to be white?  Paint and creams won&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;s a genetic mutation that gives those with it a survival advantage by allowing them to make more Vitamin D. More Vitamin D means less of the bone softening disease rickets among other things.</p>
<p>Scientists now believe that a tiny mutation in gene slc24a5, located on the long leg of chromosome 15 at position 21.1, started in the few people who left Africa and headed into Europe about 20,000  &mdash;  50,000 years ago was a major reason for the emergence of white skin.</p>
<p>This mutation became the norm in Europe 5,300 to 12,000 years ago. This gene has primary alleles that differ in only one nucleotide, changing the 111th amino acid from alanine to threonine. In White European descended peoples, the threonine form is found in from 98.7% to 100% of the population while in Africans, East Asians and American Indians from 93% to 100% of the populations have the alanine form.</p>
<p>Thank God (and nature) that I&rsquo;m White.</p>

<p>  And why not? Learned Imams have told us that the houris or wish-maidens of Islamic heaven are &#8220;light-skinned&#8221; dark eyed beauties. Why wouldn&rsquo;t Saudi women wish to be the same?  Who am I to contradict the Prophet &mdash; may his name be blessed. <br>

Well, at one time before jet travel became so common, it was a status thing. A way of showing off.   It proclaimed that they had been in Florida or the Bahamas, or had just come back from a winter cruise.  Now, it doesn&rsquo;t mean so much.</p>
<p>And we know now that it&rsquo;s not healthy either.</p>

		<p>I may have mentioned this on this blog before, let me reiterate. It has nothing to do with race, it is a strictly social construct.<br>
Before the industrial revolution the predominant labouring classes, be it in Europe or in Asia, worked outside in the fields.<br>
Working in the sun all day darkens your skin regardless of whether you are European or Asian. This darker skin automatically identified you as a member of the labouring classes. In Victorian times the only acceptable exception were the military officers who when in mufti made sure to wear their regimental tie to mark them.<br>
This is still the predominant trait in Asia which is why you will always see many elderly Chinese women carrying umbrellas against the sun.</p>

Acording  to your theory  then,  a  black dog or  horse is  intrinsically  less  aesthetically pleasing  than a  white or  light  haired counterpart.  Well, not so  for many  people. Everything  boils  down to  subjective, socially  derived  tastes, it seems.</p>
