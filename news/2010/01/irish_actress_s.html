			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Antoinette Kelly, Irish Central (New York), January 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Victoria Smurfit, star of the BBC drama set in Ireland, &#8220;Ballykissangel,&#8221; was driving with he husband Doug and other family members to a party to ring in the New Year in Cape Town when a bullet whizzed through the car.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 35-year-old Dublin-born actress has since learned that the episode was probably part of a gang initiation in which young men kill tourists to gain admission to gangs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently what happened to us was a gang initiation,&#8221; she states. &#8220;A young man wants to feel he belongs to something, tries to attach himself to a group but has to prove his mettle.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Kill a Tourist Day,&#8221; she explains. &#8220;And we were in the way. It is frustrating not knowing who the shooter was. Not as frustrating as it must be for him, unsure if he is now a murderer. Maybe he is only 12.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smurfit was at first too scared to look around to see whether her loved ones were hurt. If the bullet had been half-an-inch closer to her sister-in-law, the woman would have died, Smurfit says.</p>
<p>Yet when they called South African police to report the incident, the officer just said &#8220;yes, thank you,&#8221; and hung up. It was only when a member of the family later met someone who had police connections that the investigation went further, although Smurfit has not found out who was responsible for the attack.</p>

<p>This woman is so utterly naive that it&rsquo;s painful to read her statements. What will it take for her to wake up? The death of a loved one? Or would even that fail? I shudder to think of what it will take &hellip;</p>

Can you believe these people?!!!! What has happend to these White people. Is she being sarcastic? Doesn&rsquo;t she realize that this primitive will be disappointed when he finds out that he ISN&rsquo;t a murderer?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently what happened to us was a gang initiation,&rdquo; she states. &ldquo;A young man wants to feel he belongs to something, tries to attach himself to a group but has to prove his mettle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is this a show of sympathy for this &#8221; young man&#8221;? Somebody please tell me that she isn&rsquo;t serious!!!!!!</p>
<p>They destroyed what was the most well off country in that God forsaken continent. The tourist industry is the only thing that they have left and now they&rsquo;ve instituted &#8220;Kill a tourist day&#8221;!!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had similar experiences as a landlord in East Cleveland, Ohio. When tenants and myself complained of &#8220;yuffs&#8221; drinking beer and threatening the tenants on my property the police hung up every time we called. They refused to respond or even talk about it. They actually said they weren&rsquo;t interested in our problems. Another time I called to complain of gunfire and they responded that they were sure it was firecrackers.</p>
<p>This is the road we are headed down under black rule. Unless one personally experiences the effects of blacks upon any organization, it is hard to fathom how corrupt and inept they are,and what a debilitating effect they have on society at large.</p>

<p>This is truly frightening. Can you believe this abject drivel is coming from the mouth of an obviously intelligent 35 year old white female? You couldn&rsquo;t possibly make this stuff up without a lifetime of intensive indoctrination. Up is down, wrong is right, and black is white. If we found a team of (unindoctrinated) psychologists to study this womans statement they would immediately recommend incarceration in an asylum.</p>

		<p>I am almost speechless.  It seems like Mrs. Smurfit is really stretching to sympathize for whoever it is that almost killed her or a member of her family.</p>
<p>How can it be that South Africa, a country that has devolved into one of the murder capitals of the world, continues to be a tourist Mecca for white Europeans?  I apologize for sounding strident but if this was not an enlightening experience for her, and apparently it was not, then she deserves what she gets.</p>

<p>Welcome to the &ldquo;New South Africa,&rdquo; Comrade Smurfit!</p>
<p>Given that you work for the BBC as an &ldquo;actress,&rdquo; you probably wanted &ldquo;wicked&rdquo; and &ldquo;hateful&rdquo; Apartheid to end, and worked for such in the 1990s. Also, you would have probably chortled with glee if the ANC had done this to a &ldquo;racist&rdquo; Afrikaner actress at that time. Now, you have a realistic end to Apartheid, to base your childishly egalitarian fantasies on.</p>
<p>How do you like the reality of your anti-racist &ldquo;dreams&rdquo; now, Comrade Smurfit?</p>
<p>Better still, maybe you should channel through an ANC psychic and &#8220;speak&#8221; with Amy Biehl, if you if you have any lingering doubts? </p>

There&rsquo;s a joke they tell in Africa. &#8216;What&rsquo;s the difference between a tourist and a racist? One week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Even if Ms. Smurfit did become racially aware over the incident (highly unlikely) speaking out would ruin her career.</p>
<p><i>Smurfit has not found out who was responsible for the attack.</i></p>
<p>And she never will. Heck, it could have been a police officer.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear she&rsquo;s learned nothing  &mdash;  or maybe she&rsquo;s just playing the PC game for the press.  At any rate, she is excusing this thug&rsquo;s behavior by interpreting his actions according to the standard liberal narrative. You see, he&rsquo;s a good little 12-year-old boy who just wants to fit in.  Yes, I&rsquo;m sure he lies awake at night wondering if he&rsquo;s killed someone &hellip;  I wonder how she rationalizes the behavior of the police officer who hung up on her?</p>

 This is unbelievable. She actually sympathizes with the shooter. Worried that this poor lad must be frustrated over not knowing if he killed somebody or not. Typical liberal thinking. Maybe if the bullet was 1/2 an inch from her head she&rsquo;d be singing a different tune. Let&rsquo;s hope so. Pray for this poor woman. </p>

		<p>Whites from all over the world go to South Africa to view the blacks there like the rest of us go to the zoo and see the animals.Many of them have been killed.They are unaware of the danger because of the politicaly  correct media that tells them that blacks really dont hate their white gutz.Many of the tourguides that run these sightseeing operations are black South Africans, and they are making lots of moolah doing it.</p>

South Africa is hell on earth, not because it is the most violent place but because within living memory it was a beautiful place.

<p>O.K, but what advice would you have for any white American or any white European, who sincerely wants to travel to Africa for a safari to see African wildlife?  </p>
<p>Do you suggest that any white person who wants to go on a wildlfe watching safari, travel to Botswana, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, or Zambia, instead of South Africa?</p>
<p>Maybe Tanzania would be safer for a white tourist than South Africa?  I heard that Americans are popular in Tanzania.</p>

		<p>Even what passes for a police force today in SA exists only because of the whites still there. When the last of the whites leave, so will the final trappings of civilization.</p>
<p>Reminds me of an old saying in my hometown, &#8220;Will the last white who leaves Gary please turn out the lights?&#8221;  (sometimes sanitized as &#8220;will the last <i>person</i> please turn out the lights?&#8221;)</p>
<p>The funny thing is, deluded whites no doubt think the troubles in SA are just  &#8220;temporary growing pains&#8221; as the country adjusts&#8221; to it&rsquo;s new &#8220;freedom from apartheid.&#8221; They actually still believe SA will pull itself out of this mess. Those of us in the know understand it is really the screams of a nation in its final death throes. </p>
<p>Of course, as usual the liberals will never learn anything from this. When SA collapses they will blithely ignore it and turn their attention to the next &#8220;cause.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Dear Friends and Neighbors,</p>
<p>You now have a chance to give a once-in-a-lifetime gift to a poor, undernourished South African youth.  You can personally help a young man achieve his dream of joining a neighborhood club   &mdash;   an exclusive social organization.  It&rsquo;s easy   &mdash;   just go to South Africa, attend the World Cup, and drive around slowly. Honk your horn and wave.  Keep your window rolled down. </p>
<p>You will be giving straight from the heart   &mdash;   the greatest gift.  </p>

		<p>Firstly, I find the Irish to be the most left wing liberals I have ever met.  I lived there for a year and couldnt believe the hand wringing apologists, always collecting for some or other fund to uplift Africans.<br>
Anyway, having lived in SA for 45 years (still living here), and as an ex SA Police officer, I can categorically state that there is no such thing as kill a tourist day.  Every day is kill a person day, but whites are targeted purely because they have the money, and tourists tend to be white, so inevitably they will be targeted.  But as a gang ritual, kill a tourist day is absolute hogwash.  If you are white, you are are fair game.  Check out news24.com today.  83 year old granny tortured, murdered, burnt, nothing stolen.  She wasnt a tourist, she lived in her house for 45 years.<br>
John PM, spot on about Amy Biehl.  Her parents now employ the person that murdered their child, he works for the Amy Biehl foundation. Go figure.</p>

		<p>Cape Town Tourism has no knowledge of any gang-related campaign singling out visitors and no other attempts of this nature have been reported. The perpetrator could in fact not have known that the passengers inside the taxi were tourists as there was nothing to distinguish them from the hundreds of people (locals and visitors) in cabs that evening. </p>
<p>SAPS have refuted the claim that a member of their service speculated that the incident might have been a gang-related hit. Cape Town Tourism would like to verify that the South African Police have always been highly professional and attentive in matters relating to tourism - acutely so ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. </p>
<p>Whilst there is no doubt that Ms Smurfit and family experienced a violent and frightening occurrence (and we do not seek to undermine the trauma they experienced), the &lsquo;bullet&rsquo; in question was not proven to be a bullet as no evidence was collected. There were also no other reports of shooting incidents on New Year&rsquo;s Eve in this area.  The area in which Ms Smurfit was traveling was highly policed at the time. It is also under CCTV (closed circuit television) protection, and by the time the 2010 FIFA World Cup is underway there will be 27 additional CCTV surveillance cameras installed in the city at a cost of R10m. This will bring the total number of CCTV cameras installed in the City and along the Atlantic Seaboard strip to 280. <br>

		<p>There is something amiss here. Even the most PC of Liberals are allowed to express outrage at being shot at, as long as they don&rsquo;t point out the race of their attacker or if they manage to blame Whitey for it. What this woman is saying sounds like something she was told to say by someone who didn&rsquo;t grow up speaking English. If this is actually what she thinks and feels, well, it may be callous to say so, but too bad they missed. </p>

They think ANY white person who is afraid of blacks is &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;paranoid.&#8221;  Even if you explain to them a bad experience you&rsquo;ve had with a black organization, they STILL won&rsquo;t take your thoughts into consideration.

		<p>All of South Africa is now like a giant black ghetto.  Shootings are treated like jaywalking or vandalism.  It takes murder, )preferably mass murder, or armed robbery, (preferably with machine guns) to get a serious police response. Most of their technical crime fighting expertise has left the country&#8221; DNA fingerprinting, fingerprinting, criminal database management and data entry, police schools, forensic training for detectives, etc.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t such a bad thing.  Certainly South Africans need to adjust to diminished expectations for the future.  White people who are looking for a first world existence for their children (i.e.clean water, electricity, schools, hospitals, police protection) should transition to white countries. If Africans want white help there are certainly white companies they could pay to provide it, but they would, of course, have to be exempt from Affirmative Action in South Africa.</p>

		<p>Apparently the leftist, out of touch entertainers from Ireland are as PC and clueless as those from the US, GB, Germany, Iceland, Sweden &hellip; you get the idea. Or maybe they just have to give that appearance to keep working. Either way, they&rsquo;re buffoons. </p>
<p>The flip side is it seems the only white men in the US with any nerve are white men of Irish or Italian background. Seemingly without exception, the rest seem to be big talkers, especially on the internet, but immediately back down under physical threat from non-whites. Of course, there&rsquo;s still that irritating percentage of Irish in the US who still cling to leftist thinking, even at their own expense. Kind of like the woman above. A lot of whites are thoroughly brainwashed. </p>

		<p>   Same thing was going on in Savannah Ga in the mid to late eighties . A black gang had the initiation right of having to kill a white . There were two victims as I remember, both of them out of staters . One was a lady who was killed on River Front and I think a guy in the same area . River Front is where the scene where Forrest Gump was sitting on the park bench was filmed . A great place, good restaurants, shops, cobblestones from the 1700&rsquo;s but it is not a good place to be after dark as it is mostly in a non-white area . It was largely covered up by the city government and still is . My wife and I carried our kids there about that time and stayed out at Tybee Island . My old &#8216;79 Vista Cruiser died at Chu&rsquo;s Convenience Store and we had to walk a couple of miles to the hotel . I carried my daughter the whole way. Had we known what was going on, there&rsquo;s no way we would&rsquo;ve have even been there .  </p>

		<p>Estelle (Post #50).  Puhleeeeez.  Did you rub your hands in glee when you found an article that a person had been murdered in another country so you can gloat and say, &#8220;I told you so, there is crime everywhere&#8221;.<br>
I am so sick of that line here in SA from the self loathing white liberals. Yes, there is crime everywhere.  I kid you not, my cousin Ted, he lives outside St Austell in Cornwall, reported to me that the worst crime in his village (called Sticker) in the year 2000 (that is the year I was there with him on holiday) was a bicycle stolen outside the post office.<br>
The chap shot in the pub was lucky wasnt in that shop yesterday in Pietermaritzburg where the guys arm was almost chopped off with a panga (machette) while they where robbing him.  Or having boiling plastic poured on him before his throat is slit.<br>
Is that the reason for you posting that link?  To show there is crime everywhere.  That is why I always urge fellow Amreners to look at sites such as news24.com or just google our national newspapers to see the viciousness and brutality of the thugs in this country.</p>
<p>JohnPM, as always, thanks for the kind words.  You have always had a good word to say about us pale male South Africans, we appreciate it.<br>
