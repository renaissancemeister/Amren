<h1><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60J2I720100120">Dutch Far-Right MP on Trial Over Anti-Islam Remarks</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aaron Gray-Block, Reuters, January 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Right-wing Dutch MP Geert Wilders said on Wednesday that freedom of speech in his country was threatened, as he went on trial in Amsterdam charged with inciting hatred and discrimination against Muslims.</p>
<p>The Freedom Party leader, who has faced death threats over his political views, made the film &#8220;Fitna&#8221; in 2008 which accused the Koran of inciting violence and mixed images of terrorist attacks with quotations from the Islamic holy book.</p>
<p>He was also charged because of his outspoken remarks in the media, such as an opinion piece in a Dutch daily in which he compared Islam to fascism and the Koran to Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s book &#8220;Mein Kampf&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe in my heart and soul that freedom in the Netherlands is being threatened,&#8221; Wilders told the court. &#8220;It is not only our right, but our obligation as free people to speak out against every ideology that restricts freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>COMBATIVE</p>
<p>A fierce opponent of Islam in European culture, Wilders  &mdash;  with his trademark blonde hair  &mdash;  is popular among Dutch voters worried about immigration and its impact on Dutch society.</p>
<p>The Freedom Party became the second-largest Dutch party in the European Parliament last year, and recent polls indicated it could become the biggest party in the Dutch parliament in national elections due in May 2011.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remain combative and still convinced that this political process will only lead to an acquittal,&#8221; Wilders has said.</p>
<p>Outside the court, a crowd of protesters gathered behind police barriers to voice support for Wilders, carrying banners saying &#8220;Freedom Yes&#8221; and &#8220;Wilders trial, a political trial&#8221;.</p>
<p>An anti-racism group placed 100 comments by Wilders online at www.watwilwilders.nl to back its allegation that he is responsible for xenophobia and discrimination and that his remarks are not only criticism of a religion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Besides expert witnesses, Moszkowicz [defense lawyer Bram Moszkowicz] plans to call Mohammed Bouyeri, the convicted killer of Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh. Wilders has said Bouyeri is &#8220;living proof&#8221; that Islam inspires violence, but the prosecution is opposed to Bouyeri giving evidence.</p>

		<p>It is inaccurate to say that this case represents a &#8220;threat&#8221; to freedom of speech.  Since the man is on trial for something he said, speech is clearly not unfettered in that country.  </p>
<p>The &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221; to which the defendant refers, obviously does not exist.</p>
<p>One certainly hopes that those Dutch citizens who are rallying around the banner of freedom will be successful in their cause.  </p>

		<p>So, the idea words may be used to &#8216;incite racial discrimination&rsquo; is a punishable offense. But actually discriminating against someone, that&rsquo;s just great, and enlightenment, as long as the someones are white. </p>

<p>What is this stuff about &#8220;free people&#8221;?   Whatever gives you the notion that you&rsquo;re free people?  Your present circumstances contradict it.</p>
<p>If you truly were &#8220;free people&#8221;, you wouldn&rsquo;t be in this court, on trial for nothing more than your words and opinions!  </p>

		<p>The murder of Pym Fortuyn had as important an impact on the cause of Dutch liberty as the assasination of William of Orange had in the 16th century. Martyrs are a powerful symbol, Geert wins either way and to be honest he harps on about Islam too much rather than immigration for me.</p>

		<p>   It&rsquo;s very likely that this trial will get little or no coverage from our controlled media here in America. I bet it gets back page treatment in Great Britain as well. It is also possible that Mr. Wilders will serve some jail time.  </p>

		<p>Inciting violence used to mean that you led the people who thought like you into violence. Now, in Europe Inciting Violence means that what you say offends your political opposites so much that they engage in violence.<br>
In effect you have no right to say something that violent people may find offensive.<br>
Now, your rights are curtailed to the sesitivity of your violent classes. Also, the more sensitive they get the less free speech you have. Of course this begins a ever shrinking cycle of your free speech rights as they get more and more sesitive and more and more violent.  <br>
The post modern age of irrational thought is indeed in full swing.</p>

		<p>Wilder&rsquo;s success and the success of the Freedom Party is very inspiring. I hope pro-white leaders in the US take a long look at the formula he and his party have used to achieve that success. Good luck to Wilders and the Freedom Party.</p>
<p>As a distant observer who admittedly doesn&rsquo;t know the details of Dutch politics, it looks like this is shaping up into a classic battle where a populist leader or legislation gets the strong support of the majority, only to be thwarted by activists in the legal system, whether they be judges or lawyers. We&rsquo;ve seen similar battles in this country, for example Prop 187 and Prop 8 in California - very popular, conservative measures passed by strong majorities, only to be overturned by liberals ensconced in the legal system.</p>
<p>It would be a shame if the awakening of the Dutch white majority were stifled by authoritarian leftists using the courts to the thwart the popular will. Same thing is happening in Switzerland too, over the minaret ban issue. When the left loses at the ballot box they try to use the legal system. Cowardly and manipulative, if you ask me.</p>

<p>I suspect that you do not live in Europe.</p>
<p>In Europe the issues of mass immigration and Islam are utterly inseparable. The bulk of immigration to Europe is from Muslim countries, and it is Muslims who are overwhelmingly either demanding upfront and/or pre-emptively being ceded enormous concessions (including the abridgement of free speech for their critics, such as Wilders) by our treacherous national and EU governments.</p>

		<p>I think Wilders is neocon-leaning.  He wouldn&rsquo;t mind if Netherlands become 100% black or Chinese. Immigration is OK for him as long as the newcomers aren&rsquo;t muslims.</p>

<p>In regards to Europe, while I agree that 3rd world immigration as a whole, regardless of where it&rsquo;s from is the problem, Muslim immigration is one of  the most sizable there so IS one of the major issues and can&rsquo;t be totally separated. I also don&rsquo;t agree with the term &#8220;prejudice&#8221; here. Islam is  completely different and incompatable with Western thoughts and views, that&rsquo;s a fact not some baseless prejudice.</p>
