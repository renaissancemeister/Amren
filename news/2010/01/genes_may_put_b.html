<h1>Genes May Put Black Americans at Risk for Diabetes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yahoo! News, January 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Inherited genetic variations could explain why blacks develop type 2 diabetes at a higher rate than whites, new research suggests.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found gene expression profiles that suggest that carbohydrate metabolism should be different in the African-Americans in our population compared to Caucasians,&#8221; Dr. Cam Patterson, chief of cardiology and director of the McAllister Heart Institute at the University of North Carolina, said in a university news release.</p>
<p>That, in turn, could lead to higher rates of diabetes in blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black people may have developed a different way of metabolizing glucose  &mdash;  sugars  &mdash;  long ago in history, Patterson noted, perhaps when they were living in an environment where there was little food or when diets were very different than they are now.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Stable Patterns of Gene Expression Regulating Carbohydrate Metabolism Determined by Geographic Ancestry</p>
<p>Individuals of African descent in the United States suffer disproportionately from diseases with a metabolic etiology (obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes), and from the pathological consequences of these disorders (hypertension and cardiovascular disease).</p>
<p>Using a combination of genetic/genomic and bioinformatics approaches, we identified a large number of genes that were both differentially expressed between American subjects self-identified to be of either African or European ancestry and that also contained single nucleotide polymorphisms that distinguish distantly related ancestral populations. Several of these genes control the metabolism of simple carbohydrates and are direct targets for the SREBP1, a metabolic transcription factor also differentially expressed between our study populations.</p>
<p>These data support the concept of stable patterns of gene transcription unique to a geographic ancestral lineage. Differences in expression of several carbohydrate metabolism genes suggest both genetic and transcriptional mechanisms contribute to these patterns and may play a role in exacerbating the disproportionate levels of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease observed in Americans with African ancestry.</p>

		<p>For decades it was claimed blacks had higher rates of hypertension due to living under the stress of discrimination. So it&rsquo;s nice to see the truth of genetic racial differences slowly catching on.</p>
<p>Of course blacks also suffer from higher rates of diabetes due to their being less likely to exercise and more likely to adopt a junk-food diet than whites. </p>

		<p>Taking people out of their natural environment where they have been living for untold thousands of years, and relocating them to an alien environment has got to be destructive for them generally.  </p>
<p>Also, just as much harm is done to them by expecting them to mentally perform to the norm of a higher evolved people.</p>
<p>Political correctness refuses to recognize a difference and therein lies the basis for numerous lies and manipulations that have brought the American Empire to ruin.<br>

		<p>These researchers had better be quiet or they may get into trouble. Doesn&rsquo;t the sickening dogma of multiculturism lie that all races are the same, that no race is superior to another or different from another. Its all cultural influence you know. We are constantly told blacks and Hispanics don&rsquo;t test as well as whites because of enviornmental factors and not racial ones. Remember when the sportscaster Jimmy The Greek was banished from his job for saying blacks have greater strength in the thighs than whites? Remember when Rush was pilloried for implying that blacks may not make good quarterbacks? Saying blacks are predisposed to anything whites aren&rsquo;t is a big no no these days and facts be damned. Facts in today&rsquo;s America must be PC or they are attacked. These researchers had better keep their mouths shut befor they lose their grants. </p>

		<p>OK, but now can we discuss the genetic causes for cognitive differences between Whites and blacks?  I guess that&rsquo;s still off-limits due to the thought police&hellip;</p>

		<p>It may well be that blacks as a group are more prone to diabetes than whites.  However, once that diabetic gene is in your family tree, even if you&rsquo;re white, you are very probably going to end up with the disease.  My best friend, half Italian half Irish, just found out she&rsquo;s diabetic.  But her mother was, and her two younger siblings both are - so she didn&rsquo;t have much chance of avoiding it.  Ergo - if it&rsquo;s in your genetic heritage, no matter what your race, BE CAREFUL - you are MUCH more prone to getting diabetes.</p>

		<p>I think I have commented about this before. Whites have the genetics to metabolize stuff from their diet that non-whites cannot. Primarily any dairy based product. Whiteys are the ancestors of hundreds of generations of cattle raising, cattle herding folks. 80 % of the persons on this planet are unable to digest milk and milk products.</p>
<p>We can metabolize milk products in a way others cannot. Others trying to eat the dairy based diet run the risk of all sorts of physical infirmity. Blacks, American Indians, Hawaiian islanders,etc. </p>
<p>And just plain ordinary bad eating habits too. As Michael Savage once said: &#8220;anytime you sit down and eat a dozen Big Macs, six orders of fries, and three milk shakes, all at one sitting, you are going to have a problem!!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Jedderman,</p>
<p>Africans in may parts  of  Africa  have reared  cattle  for  thousands of  years(do the  research) and  as a  result those  from  the  cattle  rearing areas  of  Africa  are  lactose  tolerant.  Examples: Kenyans, West  Africans from the  Savanah  areas.  Indigenous  South  Africans  have  reared  cattle for  a  very  long time but I am  not sure  of their  lactose  tolerance  levels.</p>

		<p>The liberals don&rsquo;t have a problem pointing out bad things about blacks at all.  They just don&rsquo;t want whites to come to the conclusion that black problems are based on anything other than whites or &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>
