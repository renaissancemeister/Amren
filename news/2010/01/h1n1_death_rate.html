			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Molly Hennessy-Fiske, Los Angeles Times, January 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>California Latinos have been nearly twice as likely as whites to die of H1N1 flu since the pandemic began last spring, according to statewide figures released Thursday by the California Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>Over the same months, blacks in the state have been 50% more likely to die of H1N1 flu than whites, the report said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chavez [Dr. Gilberto Chavez, an epidemiologist] said blacks were three times as likely as whites to be hospitalized with H1N1 flu, and Latinos twice as likely. Native Americans, who make up most of the &#8220;other&#8221; category in state H1N1 data, are also more likely to be hospitalized and die of H1N1 flu than whites, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are several reasons for the higher mortality and hospitalization rates among some minorities, Chavez said. Blacks and Latinos have high rates of chronic health conditions, such as diabetes and obesity, that studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate put them at greater risk for flu, he said. They also tend to have less access to healthcare and wait longer to seek help, he said, which reduces the chances for successful treatment with antiviral medication.</p>
<p>&#8220;For cultural reasons, they may be waiting too long to seek care,&#8221; Chavez said. &#8220;This gives us an idea of who we need to target for outreach and immunizations.&#8221;</p>
<p>More difficult to explain, Chavez said, is why Asians were more likely than whites to be hospitalized with H1N1, yet are less likely to die of it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 55% of patients hospitalized with H1N1 flu in L.A. County were Latino, 130 of 237 patients as of Aug. 3, the most recent data available from the county Department of Public Health. Of the total, 17% were white, 8% black, 4% Asian, 2% other and 14% unknown (meaning hospital staff failed to determine and report a patient&rsquo;s ethnicity to the county), records show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those hospitalizations occurred before the county sponsored 109 public vaccination clinics in the fall. Of those vaccinated at the clinics, 29% were Asian, 44% Latino, 3% black and 19% white as of Nov. 25, the most recent information available, county health officials said.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County is 47% Latino, 29% white, 13% Asian and 8% black, according to the most recent census figures.</p>

		<p>I suspect this was known or anticipated all along. It would have been impossible in these ultra-egalitarian times to openly state that certain racial groups were in greater danger than others, so the officials just over-hyped the whole thing(not unlike the CDC did with AIDS years ago). Obviously, all the scare-mongering and media-fueled hysteria has fizzled like a soggy firecracker. </p>

<p>Please note that the possibility of genetic predisposition is not mentioned. Certain groups such as American Indians, Hawaiian islanders, etc., groups that lived in isolation from the rest of mankind for thousands of years, are very susceptible to contracting and dying from all sorts of oddball illnesses that normally bother but do not KILL whitey. The common cold, measles, mumps, influenza were historically and are now major killers of aboriginal peoples. Swine flu is just one more variant on a common theme.</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever seen what Blacks and Hispanics put into their shopping carts, you wouldn&rsquo;t need wonder why they drop like flies, when a virus comes around.  Everything is Sugar-laden, and everything is processed to the hilt.  At least, that&rsquo;s how it is where I shop.  Maybe they read the contents lists on labels, and fail to understand that &#8216;Sucrose&rsquo; and &#8216;Maltose&rsquo; basically mean &#8216;Sugar&rsquo;.  However, I doubt many of them read labels.</p>
<p>The daughter of an unusually enlightened physician told me, once, that refined Sugar is an immunosuppressant.  The more Sugar, the more pronounced the effect.  By the time a person has ingested twenty teaspoons of Sugar, his immune system is in near-total dysfunction. It&rsquo;s not as hard as one would imagine, to ingest that much, in a day.</p>
<p>Whites and Asians are smart enough to know what contains the most Sugar (if only for weight-control and dental reasons).  And have, to some degree, taken Sugar Avoidance up as part of our everyday lives.  We may not even think of the issue, beyond &#8220;healthy&#8221; and &#8220;unhealthy&#8221; designations for the foods we consider.</p>
<p>Blacks and Hispanics, I suspect, are unaware that the Sugar-coated cereals, soft drinks, frozen Sugarwater-on-a-stick &#8216;treats&rsquo;, Sugarwater masquerading as Soup, Spaghetti sauces that are not much more than Sugar + Onion Powder + Salt, Pasteurized Orange Juice, Condensed Milk &hellip;.are adding up to a horrendous suppression of their immune systems.</p>
<p>I suspect that the deadly Influenza epidemic following WWI was largely the result of newly-introduced sugar-laden foods, coupled with wartime stress, and other deficiencies inherent in that era&rsquo;s sudden change to over-processed foods.</p>
<p>So, add Sugar Poisoning to a disdain for fresh produce (unless it&rsquo;s cooked into a brown mush&hellip;and heaven forbid you should try to serve Broccoli to Black friends&hellip;you might as well set live snakes in front of them), and you have a vulnerable population.</p>
<p>&#8220;Access&#8221; to health care, and &#8220;inequities&#8221;, have nothing to do with it.  But yes, there is a genetic component.  That component has to do with intelligence.  </p>
