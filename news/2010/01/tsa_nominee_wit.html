<h1>TSA Nominee Withdraws Amid &#8216;Political Agenda&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julie Pace, AP, January 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama&rsquo;s choice to lead the Transportation Security Administration withdrew his name Wednesday, a setback for an administration still trying to explain how a man could attempt to blow up a commercial airliner on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Erroll Southers said he was pulling out because his nomination had become a lightning rod for those with a political agenda. Obama had tapped Southers, a top official with the Los Angeles Airport Police Department, to lead the TSA in September but his confirmation has been blocked by Republican Sen. Jim DeMint, who says he was worried that Southers would allow TSA employees to have collective bargaining rights.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Associated Press, Southers said the confirmation process made him question his willingness to participate in public service.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not a politician. I&rsquo;m a counterrrorism expert,&#8221; Southers said Wednesday. &#8220;They took an apolitical person and politicized my career.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Questions have also been raised about a reprimand that Southers received for running background checks on his then-estranged wife&rsquo;s boyfriend two decades ago. Southers, a former FBI agent, wrote a letter to lawmakers earlier this month acknowledging that he had given inconsistent answers to Congress on that issue.</p>
<p>In an October affidavit for the Senate Homeland Security committee, Southers initially said he asked a San Diego police employee to run a background check on his then-estranged wife&rsquo;s boyfriend and was censured by his FBI superiors 20 years ago for what he said was an isolated instance.</p>
<p>But a day after the committee approved his nomination and sent it to the full Senate, he wrote to the senators and told them that he was incorrect, that he had twice run background checks himself.</p>

		<p>In addition to all his other problems, Southers is also two-faced.  On the one hand, he pronounced adherents of Christian Identity as the real domestic terrorist threats.  On the other hand, he blamed the Jews for our foreign policy conflagrations with the Arab world, thereby making the same contention of the CI &#8220;domestic terrorists&#8221; he hates so much.  What was most discomforting about the latter is that his attitude seemed to be that we had to check in our foreign policy with Al Qaeda.  In other words, OBL says jump, Erroll Southers asks how high?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Erroll Southers said he was pulling out because his nomination had become a lightning rod for those with a political agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation:  Too much shady, illegal activities, as well as a decided bias against other groups, which would show up if anyone were to REALLY check him out.</p>
<p>This is just another unqualified black this pro-black community organizer is trying to secure in order to blacken his administration as much as he can get away with without one of them being the cause of some catastrophe, like the crotch bomber getting through security or having a radical Muslim shooting people.</p>
<p>The self-described communist Van Jones is out, thanks to Glenn Beck, but the rest of the community organizer&rsquo;s administration amount to radicals, revolutionaries, kooks, oddballs and geeks as strange as the aliens in the space bar in the Star Wars movie.</p>

<p>How laughable!</p>
<p>One wonders, what more insightful information he might have provided the full Senate had he run two background checks ON himself, prior to writing them with that revelation? </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I love that photo too. The three stars, the egg-salad on the hat, etc. An airport policeman! Well, he did have some credentials, yes he did. Better than what I thought he would have had. Those background checks are something that J. Edgar used to do all the time for Shirley Temple Black. OH WELL, no position now.</p>

		<p>Another two-faced unqualified affirmative action black person.  After you have dumbed down your society for fifty years this is what you select from&hellip;shame, shame.</p>
<p>And the Senate approved him, what does that say about the Senate?</p>
<p>Vote them all out, begin anew.</p>
