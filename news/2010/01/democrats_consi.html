			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christina Bellantoni, Talking Points Memo, January 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Lawmakers who want to extend health coverage to illegal immigrants will not block the passage of the final health care reform bill so long as the White House offers a substantive promise to start pushing comprehensive immigration legislation this year.</p>
<p>Democrats who want a comprehensive bill that reforms immigration law but also offers a pathway to citizenship have threatened to vote against health care if illegal immigrants aren&rsquo;t included in the new system, making immigration one of the sticking points as Democratic leaders negotiate the final details.</p>
<p>Democratic leadership aides believe that a firm White House promise of a comprehensive immigration bill will be enough to quell any House dissent.</p>
<p>TPMDC sources have been telling us that members won&rsquo;t admit it publicly but they are ready to concede on immigration in the health care bill. {snip}</p>
<p>A source familiar with the negotiations between Congress and the White House told TPMDC the Congressional Hispanic Caucus will demand an agreement from Obama that health care coverage for illegals who earn a path to citizenship will be addressed in an immigration bill.</p>
<p>The Senate&rsquo;s health care bill bars illegal immigrants from any sort of coverage {snip}/</p>
<p>Those familiar with the talks say any immigration legislation will include various amnesty provisions to allow for health care coverage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A source told us that members who have championed immigration reform &#8220;aren&rsquo;t actually conceding, just changing tactics&#8221; to secure coverage for illegal immigrants whatever way they came.<br>

		<p>Even if Obama and the Democrats don&rsquo;t push a formal amnesty bill in 2010, which they may not, b/c it&rsquo;s an election year, I don&rsquo;t think it will matter.  Illegals will still get HCR benefits, because there will be no verification of immigration status, even if there were, many illegals get fake IDs, and barring that, Federal programs are run by liberal xenophile bureaucrats, many of those are Hispanic in Hispanic-heavy states, who won&rsquo;t tell illegal aliens no.</p>
<p>Look at it this way:  Illegal aliens aren&rsquo;t allowed to vote, but several million actually do.  The reason for that is that the canvassing boards are run by liberals or Hispanics in states like CA.  They won&rsquo;t bother to check.</p>

<p>As is typical of the ever scrounging and duplicitous Hispanics and their treasonous homegrown Comrades, they will lose a battle simply to win the war. Never mind that winning the war will ultimately see them back in Third World &ldquo;splendor,&rdquo; only that they &ldquo;triumph&rdquo; is of concern. </p>
<p>And here, all this time what I was taught about Marxists, was that they are the most admirably long term planners? </p>
<p>Well, that is where we must always beat them back for now and in due course punish them later, should we ever get the chance. They so very much love the retroactively comprehensive, do they not?</p>
<p>I say, if the day ever comes, let&rsquo;s give it to them in spades! </p>
<p>May God let it be so!!!<br>

		<p>This was obviously cooking on the back burner all along. All those utterly unconvincing proclamations about illegals NOT receiving govt. healthcare, etc&hellip;of course not, there will be NO illegals when the Amnesty storm blows over. </p>
<p>In the upcoming weeks, I believe this is going to become the major new push for 2010, as the healthcare deal is pretty much done. </p>

		<p>I believe it is gradually beginning to dawn on the Democrats (I mean, the marxists)- that in 2010 and probably in 2012 also, they are going to be tarred, feathered, and rid&rsquo; outa town on a rail via the ballot box   &mdash;   so they are frantically trying to make any kind of deal to get as much as their garbage in place before they&rsquo;re thrown out.  Of course, when the conservatives get back in where they belong, we can redo all the legislation that the marxists put in.  It is also true that the Democrats tend to ignore the fact that the MAJORITY of Americans are furious with them over immigration, healthcare, and a number of other issues; those that are seeing the light are worried, as they should be.  November isn&rsquo;t that far off, folks - cheer up!</p>

		<p>A complete non-issue as far as I am concerned.</p>
<p>The democrats are finished&hellip;.kaput&hellip;.DONE.  They all know it too.  That&rsquo;s why so many of them are abandoning ship&hellip;.choosing to retire rather than seek re-election etc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that the republicans will take back control of both houses this year.  That is if a single democrat wins ANY election this year.  That they will not is actually possible considering the mood of the country.</p>
<p>But what will come next?  It is expected that the republicans will kill cap and trade, kill Obamacare and kill amnesty and work toward fiscal responsibility.  The very barest minimum of what is expected of them.  Will they do it?  That is in doubt.  If they don&rsquo;t, what then?  Revolution is a distinct possibility.  Civil war&hellip;..as it becomes clear to even the stupid that our government does not do what the people want&hellip;..ever.</p>
<p>There is still the possibility of a political solution to these problems including race issues by basically defunding the federal government, raising state militias, currencies and economies, and bending certain of these to de facto white nationalism.</p>
<p>Will it happen?  I think it will.  We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

		<p>First, I heard an interview with a writer from Human Events who made the point that we have a government that is at war with the American People. What is happening in this country is what would be if we were taken over by a foreign power. </p>
<p>More specifically to this article, what angers me the most is that not only are illegals being granted amnesty, all those people who wish to come to this country legally languish while the illegals jump the line, and are rewarded for it.</p>
<p>Our country is being invaded and politicians from both sides of the political spectrum are aiding and abetting. The 2010 election must be decisive in getting rid of most of the politicians currently in office. </p>

		<p>I want every politician at national, state and local levels who wants illegal immigrants to be here and profit from their lawbreaking, to have to stand before us on nationwide TV and tell us why. It should be pretty revealing. If they told the truth (a novel idea), they would have to admit their push for rewarding illegals was for payoffs, votes or just because they want to turn this country into the third  world mess these people come from. There are many countries much poorer than Mexico. Can one imagine what would happen if we were completely surrounded by these places? We&rsquo;re experiencing a taste of that now and it will only get worse unless we vote out those who aid and abet the criminals!</p>

<p>Obama IS a liar; as are most of the &#8220;honorable&#8221; senators and congressmen holding office. They&rsquo;re determined to screw the voters once again, by defying the will of the American people.</p>

		<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t matter what is done publicly. Most of the severely damaging bills are sneaked through on the tails of a larger, less intrusive bills. We never hear about those, and the public has no idea they&rsquo;re in place until they get riled up enough from the results to question how it got that way.</p>

 Yeah but the Republicrats want immigration amnesty for the illegal labor in the corporate plantation. The thing they will do is rail about how they cannot overide a presidential veto after the Demicans are ousted We will be played as fools like always,</p>

<p>Not going to happen. Things don&rsquo;t usually get much worse for us under Republican rule, but they don&rsquo;t get any better, either. Remember the Republican revolution of &#8216;94? The Republicans largely prevented Clinton from passing any more liberal garbage, but they didn&rsquo;t get rid of any of his liberal garbage that was already in place. </p>
<p>As G.K. Chesterton noted many years ago, the job of liberals is to go on making all of history&rsquo;s mistakes, and the job of conservatives is to make sure those mistakes are never corrected. This is how the political systems in most Western nations operate. They just keep going &#8220;click, click, click&#8221; like a ratchet, towards a place no one wants to go. </p>
