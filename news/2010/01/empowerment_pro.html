<h1><a href="http://www.indypressny.org/nycma/voices/405/news/news_1/">Empowerment Project Aims to Harness Black Buying Power, Community Strength</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>La Risa Lynch, Carib News, December 30, 2009.</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Chicago area couple [John and Maggie Anderson] {snip} decided to forgo shopping at the Walmarts and Targets of the world and buy all their necessities from food, clothing, to furniture from quality Black-owned businesses or professional service providers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Andersons wanted to change Black Americans&rsquo; mindset from just being consumers to being more conscious of how they spent their money and with whom. It wasn&rsquo;t too long ago that Blacks largely patronized Black businesses, said Mrs. Anderson, formerly a business consultant who now heads the Empowerment Experiment full-time. Before the fight for integration in this country, Blacks had little choice but to support their own. She said integration was a good thing, but for Blacks &#8220;integration was bad economically .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  because we lost that sense of duty to shop with our own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Integration, economically, was just permission for us to shop with everyone else, and opportunity for everyone else to make money off of us,&#8221; said Maggie, a mother of two daughters, Cara, 4, and Cori, 3. Blacks are a distant third in entrepreneur success rates compared to Latinos and Asians, a stark contrast from 20 years ago, when Black businesses were first, she said. Black communities now subsist on the usual suspects of chicken shacks, barbershops and braid salons, and are still poor and rundown, Maggie added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Anderson&rsquo;s push for self-help economics has been criticized as racist, a notion Maggie finds absurd. She said other ethnic groups &#8220;openly and proactively support their own,&#8221; but critics call it racist when Blacks want thriving business communities comparable to Little Italy or Chinatown.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They did the ground work of their experiment, which will end this year, in an academic study to monitor the potential and economic impact of buying Black. They plan to use their website EEforTomorrow.com to track spending habits.</p>
<p>Supporters can register at the site and will be able to log what they&rsquo;ve spent with Black business.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The goal is to determine if a concerted effort to buy Black would reduce unemployment, spur job creation, increase an area&rsquo;s tax base or reduce crime. Maggie Anderson noted that only five percent of African-American&rsquo;s purchasing dollar stays in the Black community. She wants that number to rise into the double digits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, we just want people to support quality Black businesses and professionals and buy Black-made products that are already out there,&#8221; she said. The couple has established a foundation to solicit donations for their endeavors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While Black purchasing power nears $1 trillion, revenues from Black businesses only equaled $88 billion in 2002, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. James Clingman, an advisor with the experiment who has a syndicated column called Blackonomics, said those figures show Blacks are not patronizing their own.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not easy begging my own people to keep supporting one another when all they do is complain about poor goods and services .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like they never had a bad experience at a White-owned, Arab-owned, Asian-owned or Indian-owned business,&#8221; Maggie said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That misconception of the White man&rsquo;s ice is always colder felled Karriem Beyah&rsquo;s grocery store, the only Black-owned full-service grocery store in Chicago. The store closed because of lack of support from the Black community. The Andersons routinely shopped there.</p>
<p>Mr. Beyah retooled the store for his Latino customers, which he said, supported his businesses more than Black consumers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>I was saying the exact same thing when the &#8216;Empowerment Experiment&rsquo; was featured on AmRen last year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an &#8216;experiment&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>Why White people should do the same. Avoid buying from businesses staffing and being owned by non-Whites. Prefer small White owned business-white staffed businesses over non-white owned White staffed/ White owned non White staffed and big corporations. Never shop at non-White owned-non-White staffed businesses, they do not help the White community in any way.<br>
Avoid buying from companies who actively discriminate against White people. There is a list of the big 50 offenders right here.<br>

Research these companies on the internet and avoid all their brands if you can.</p>

		<p>I think all companies now discriminate against the Euro Whites in this country. It is in vogue. McDonalds and Walmart are two that come to mind. I don&rsquo;t go to either to shop or eat. Johnson and Johnson, Proctor and Gamble are two more that come to mind. But, has anyone EVER seen Whites protest and march against these companies and businesses? Nope. Maybe it is time! The squeaky wheel gets the grease.</p>

		<p>Jasper is right, buy white.  There is a hardward store in our town that has been family owned and operated for over 100 years.  It has an all-white staff who are very knowledgeable; some of those guys have been working there for 40 years.  Their prices are fair and there&rsquo;s no junk, it&rsquo;s all good quality.  I have never seen a non-white customer in there, but the store is thriving due its strong white base.</p>
<p>We also have a Home Depot where you can get treated to blaring announcements in Spanish and employees who give you that glazed-over look if you ask them a question.  You all know the look I mean.  Needless to say, we never go there.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem at all with her premise or her program.  Let blacks buy only from blacks.  Let whites buy only from whites.  But let&rsquo;s take it to it&rsquo;s logical extension then, and return our country back to when it was prosperous, relatively peaceful, and without pandemic crime and wealth distribution.  Let blacks LIVE only around blacks, let whites LIVE only around whites, let employers hire ONLY those they wish regardless of color and only as they see fit, let people be hired ONLY on merit, let folks vote ONLY if they have a stake in the outcome as to property ownership, or ONLY if they pay taxes from gainful employment.  Let only whites police white neighborhoods and only blacks police black neighborhoods.  In other words, if this woman wants to return to segregation economically, let&rsquo;s go the whole way and return to segregation in EVERY way.  If her argument makes sense economically, it ALSO makes sense socially.</p>

		<p>When you buy a car, make sure to get a white salesman.  When I call my local utilities I always make sure I&rsquo;m dealing with a white person to lessen the likelihood of a screw-up.</p>
<p>When dining out make sure you properly relate to your black waiter/waitress by tipping in accordance with black standards - true multicultural skills at work.</p>
<p>How come your order is never wrong at a Chinese restaurant and almost never right at a fast food place staffed by blacks?</p>
<p>I think they would benefit the most from an all black car company.  Look at the billions they give to whites and Asians in car sales.  What is more racist than forcing blacks into cars with the color preferences of whites?<br>

		<p>One more thing, for those in the U.K (any other country where this applies) avoid the racist mobile network company Vodafone, who actively discriminate aginst Whites in South Africa.<br>

		<p>Great idea!</p>
<p>Boycott whitey. Do not rent a house owned by a white. Do not take a job at a firm owned by a white. Do not read any books written by a white. Do not attend classes taught by whites.</p>
<p>Excellent idea.<br>
