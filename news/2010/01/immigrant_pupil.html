<h1>Immigrant Pupils Need New State Schools, Says OECD</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Walshe, Independent (Dublin), January 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A LEADING international think-tank has proposed that the Government set up new state-run primary schools to better cater for the new multi-ethnic pupil population.</p>
<p>The new state schools could even take over some existing primary schools, the majority of which are run by the Catholic Church. The radical proposals are contained in a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), which suggests that the present system of individual patron bodies running 3,300 primary schools is out of date.</p>
<p>At present, one in 10 primary school students are immigrants. The report says that the current patronage model has started to show strains, as immigration adds to the diversity of Irish society.</p>
<p>One alternative is to increase the diversity of patron bodies. The number of multi-denominational and interdenominational primary schools has increased from 39 to 67 from 2005 to 2008. But the number of non-Catholic schools is still small. The number of schools under the patronage of Catholic bishops has only dropped slightly  &mdash;  from 3,039 to 3,027  &mdash;  over the same period, says the report.</p>
<p>Schools in areas where the numbers of immigrants would be too small to justify the setting up of additional establishments could have difficulty in preserving their ethos while accommodating diversity. &#8220;A more radical option would be to channel expansion, and even transfer the authority over existing institutions away from the system of education provision by patron bodies,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>The OECD&rsquo;s report quotes a study from the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) which shows that one-fifth of students in Ireland may not be able to enrol in their school of choice. The OECD says it would be useful to explore the feasibility of establishing state schools, separate from the structure of patron bodies. The Community National School is being piloted in two schools under the patronage of Co Dublin Vocational Education Committee.</p>
<p><b>Enrolment</b></p>
<p>&#8220;These new schools are multi-denominational. If they prove to be effective, the Irish authorities should consider creating net new capacity and re-deploying existing capacity through this channel,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>The OECD also recommends that existing schools should network and co-operate to ensure a more even distribution in the enrolment of immigrant students. Integration Minister John Curran said the report would help the development of the new Intercultural Education Strategy which will be finalised shortly.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Department of Education said that a joint department-VEC steering group was overseeing the development of the new Co Dublin schools including arrangements for the delivery of religious education and evaluation of the pilot phase.<br>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe this!  Catholic schools have provided the best education to their students for hundreds of years - and this inept stupid guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t is now going to come in and tell them how to do it???  They should recognize their indebtedness to the Catholic Church for educating Ireland&rsquo;s kids for millenia, and if they want to start some state schools for non-Catholics, let&rsquo;em.  Just leave the Catholic schools alone, fools - they don&rsquo;t need ANY guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t interference.  Let the state do the diversity and see how they like it!!</p>

I remember a lifetime ago how the Nuns told us to run past the public school kids clutching our lunches like the little Roman marytr boy who refused to let go of the Holy Eucharist&hellip; Now my guess would be that whoever is dumping all these people on the West, the last thing they want for their minions, is a good old Catholic school education. It dulls the wedge they`re whacking us with!</p>

		<p>I only went to Catholic schools for the first 4 or 5 years of my achool life. My dad was in the military and we moved a lot and spent a lot of time overseas, so he gave up on keeping me in Catholic schools. I hated the Catholic schools. I was so glad to get into a public school. </p>
<p>But, guess what? I finally appreciated them when I got older. Those nuns may have been tough, but I learned how to diagram a sentence, read, and write a coherent sentence. I also learned penmanship and how to spell (which seems to to be out of favor nowadays.) They taught math and the times tables. The nuns weren&rsquo;t mean, they were just strict.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go to college until I was in my late thirties. I was a biology major. I sincerely believe that without that foundation I had when I was young I would never have made it. </p>

		<p>What goes around comes around&hellip;..they are reaping what they have sowed for eons. Is it not the Catholic Church (among many Protestant churches) that are in the forefront of bringing in all these &#8220;immigrants&#8221; into our nations and are now having to enjoy the &#8220;fruits of their labor&#8221;?  Quit balking and enjoy!</p>

		<p>  Why Ireland a country of four million souls thought it necessary to have immigration is beyond me. They country had existed for a thousand years without it. Why was it needed today?</p>

		<p>I have an idea. Since Ireland is hustling the US to give amnesty to the 10,000 or more illegal Irish here, why not send the illegals who&rsquo;ve broken into Ireland home and take back their own?<br>
This whole illegal immigration problem is horrifying. I can just see, in the next decade, many countries standing empty because their citizens felt it their right to invade another country. We are already overwhelmed with Hispanic illegals, we don&rsquo;t need the Irish too. And before I&rsquo;m accused of being anti-Irish, three of my four maternal g-grandparents came from Ireland. I just am anti-anyone who comes here illegally.</p>
