<h1><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/ci_14176531">DPS Menu for MLK Birthday Hard for Some to Digest</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeremy P. Meyer, Denver Post, January 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Denver Public Schools apologized Tuesday for what it called a &#8220;well-intentioned but highly insensitive&#8221; attempt to honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>Friday&rsquo;s DPS lunch menu, headlined &#8220;In Honor Of M.L. King,&#8221; offered students &#8220;Southern Style&#8221; chicken and collard greens  &mdash;  a meal that some say is an offensive caricature of black culture.</p>
<p>In a statement issued Tuesday night and posted on the school district&rsquo;s website, DPS spokesman Michael Vaughn said the meal was &#8220;highly insensitive in light of certain hurtful cultural stereotypes still harbored in parts of our society.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Denver Public Schools are great because they are so diverse, but this sort of thing undermines the positive things that kids can get in school,&#8221; said Holladay, who is white but whose husband is black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, Lecia Brooks, interim director at the Civil Rights Memorial Center in Montgomery, Ala., said reducing the honor for King to a chicken lunch is offensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, it&rsquo;s heartbreaking for Dr. King and all he did and what he is about is now reduced to the &#8216;I Have a Dream&rsquo; speech and now chicken,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s very upsetting. If that is the message young people are receiving, then why have a holiday?&#8221;<br>

		<p>I am growing weary of the fried chicken outrage. This is twice in one week we have had to read about some poor blacks feeling outraged because of fried chicken. MLK grew up in Atlanta. I would bet he loved fried chicken, watermelon, BBQ ribs, etc. Everyone here does. Blacks do not have a corner on fried chicken. <br>
By the way, I am sick to death the MLK is the only man in America honored with a holiday using his name. I will thank the country for MLK Blvd since it is clear sign for whites of what street to avoid in any city.</p>

		<p>If they&rsquo;re not going to serve the fried chicken and the collard greens, then I&rsquo;ll take them for a Robert E. Lee Day dinner I&rsquo;m planning on Monday.  After all, his birthday, also observed on the same day as Martin Luther King&rsquo;s, is a state holiday in many Southern states.</p>
<p>I noticed that this reporter got a rebuttal quote from Montgomery, Alabama, but it&rsquo;s not from the Southern Poverty Law Center.  There&rsquo;s a first time for everything, I suppose.</p>

		<p> The writer got a good, sensible comment from the school board president (I only wish he&rsquo;d been White, and had said the same thing), and that should have been the end of the article.</p>
<p> But, no, the common-sense side couldn&rsquo;t be allowed to win this argument! The writer ranged all the way to Montgomery, Ala., to find a &#8220;civil rights spokesman&#8221; who would do the &#8220;heart-broken&#8221; handwringing he wanted at the end of the story. Reporters often give the side they agree with the last word; that is exactly what Mr. Meyer did.</p>

		<p>Personally, I love southern food and would eat it all the time if it weren&rsquo;t so damn unhealthy.</p>
<p>Why are blacks rejecting their culinary heritage? Yes, their foods have been negatively stereotyped in the past, but it seems like an equally valid way to overcome that history is to embrace those foods, rather than reject them. After all, it&rsquo;s good stuff! </p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m hungry.</p>

		<p>The real story here is the fact that blacks are offended at there own behavior and likes. No other culture on Earth would be offended at someone else associating them w/ there own heritage. You can&rsquo;t offend a German by wearing lederhosen!!<br>

		<p>The DPS also referred to MLK&rsquo;s famous speech as &#8220;I Have a Drumstick&#8221; so I can see why they became confused. Seriously, it&rsquo;s no-win situation. If they served filet mignon they would be accused of promoting &#8220;white food&#8221; and if they served nothing at all they would be accused of &#8220;reminding people of the days when slaves were starved.&#8221; If they offered milkshakes there would be outrage because insensitive whites &#8220;purposely overlooked the high-rate of lactose intolerance among African-Americans.&#8221; The lesson: there never should have been an MLK holiday in the first place.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to disagree and say that just for this year, we should devote the entire week to a study of Martin Luther King Jr. By Friday, students should demonstrate a clear grasp the racial double standard as it pertains to such noble undertakings as PLAGIARISM, involvement with the COMMUNIST PARTY, and how &#8220;borrowing&#8221; from those more learned than yourself may someday get you your very own holiday&hellip;.  </p>

		<p>Stories like this further reinforce the idea that segregation was, and still is, efficient.  Guaranteed if on that phony excuse for a day off called &#8220;Martin Luther&#8221; King Day the public schools were serving what they normally serve on a Friday in January it would be called &#8220;racist&#8221; because it wasn&rsquo;t honoring American black culture in reference to King.  So what do you serve?  You got it; fried chicken, collard greens, okra, black-eyed peas and yams.  I am convinced America will never grasp the fact that stereotypes and stereotyping is showing reality for what it is.       </p>

Well, if you&rsquo;re a spineless worm, or a group of spineless worms (DPS), you can neither mention blackness, or fail to mention it.<br>
There is no language, no matter how elloquent, or any rant, no matter how virulent, than can describe the scope of the madness, cawardice, and intense, debased stupidity of these DPS jackasses, and their ilk, wherever they may be.<br>
Truly, Marxist whites are not able to survive the rigors of everyday life. Their minds are melted like cheese. They are too mad to survive, and they&rsquo;ll destroy everything.</p>

Why should be offensive for blacks mentioning dishes (and quite tasty ones) that are typical for their cuisine? <br>
Are people from Alsace offended, when talking about them and choucroute (&#8220;Sauerkraut&#8221; done with white wine and sausages) in one sentence? <br>
They even make it one of the region symbols, for - and celebrate choucroute festivities!</p>

		<p>Sometimes stereotypes aren&rsquo;t far off.  When I was in college I had a part-time job at a seafood restaurant that&rsquo;s part of a well-known chain.  There was a black university nearby and whenever they had homecoming or graduation the restaurant was packed and despite being a seafood place we would sell alot of chicken that night.</p>

<p>I was under the assumption that him being black was the only reason we have MLK Day.  Just think, if it weren&rsquo;t for that unfortunate event at the Lorraine Motel, MLK was have died a nobody about a decade ago.  <br>

<p>  &mdash;  knuckledragger</p>
<p>I despise this time of year as the entire school district turns itself inside and out to honor this fraud  &mdash;  while the Founding Fathers are debased, mocked and dismissed as &#8216;irrelevant, dead White slaver holders.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>After all, according to government-mandated textbooks, the US Constitution was based on the Iroquois League (from Wiki):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The United States Congress passed a resolution in October 1988, specifically recognizing the influence of the Iroquois League upon the US Constitution and Bill of Rights&hellip;&#8221;  </p>
<p>And yes he did plagiarize and consult/consort with Communists, but there&rsquo;s also the following, which says a lot about this &#8216;man of the cloth&rsquo; revered as a &#8216;moral icon&rsquo; (from the late, great Sam Francis):  </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Mr. Brennan&hellip;stated that he had personally been involved in the FBI surveillance of King and knew from first-hand observation the truth about King&rsquo;s sexual conduct &mdash; conduct that Mr. Brennan characterized as  &#8216;orgiastic and adulterous escapades, some of which indicated that King could be bestial in his sexual abuse of women.&rsquo; He also stated that &#8216;King frequently drank to excess&rsquo;&hellip; FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover described King as &#8216;a tom cat with obsessive degenerate sexual urges.&rsquo;  President Lyndon Johnson called King a &#8216;hypocrite preacher.&rsquo; &hellip;There are volumes of material labeled &lsquo;obscene.&rsquo; </p>
<p>According to Assistant FBI director Sullivan:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; King spent his last night on Earth having sex with two women at the motel and physically beating and abusing a third&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p> It is precisely this material that is sealed under court order until the year 2027 and to which the Senate was denied access prior to the vote on the King holiday&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/3yfot</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/yan2rk3</p>
<p>I expect those tapes will never see the light of day and have probably by now been destroyed or erased  &mdash;  the government, of course will claim the tapes are &#8216;have deteriorated and are inaudible&rsquo; and that will be the end of it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a &#8216;memorial&rsquo; is being raised in his honor on the National Mall in Washington DC and king is the only American to have a holiday named after him.</p>
<p>Let the truth be known, all of it  &mdash;  before it becomes heavily-punished Hate Speech.</p>

		<p>The fool named Holladay quoted in the story is an &#8216;anti-bias educator&rsquo; who apparently spent several days on the phone harassing school administrators about this. Sounds like they ignored her as best the could. What are the odds they she will approach the schools to hire her to give her scam &#8216;Teaching Tolerance&rsquo; presentation. Being offended on behalf of blacks is a great business opportunity for an &#8216;anti-bias&rsquo; educator.</p>
