<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20100104/US.Census.Indigenous.Immigrants/">Indigenous Immigrants to Be Counted in 2010 Census</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Juliana Barbassa and Manuel Valdes, Comcast News, January 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For most people, describing themselves on the U.S. Census form will be as easy as checking a box: White. Black. American Indian.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not so simple for indigenous immigrants  &mdash;  the Native Americans of Mexico and Central America. They often need more than one box because their ancestry can cover multiple Census categories, and they must also overcome a significant language barrier and a mistrust of government.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau wants to change that in the 2010 count as it tallies immigrant indigenous groups for the first time ever, hoping to get a more complete snapshot of a growing segment of the immigrant population.</p>
<p>In the 2010 Census, the bureau will tabulate handwritten entries specifying that the respondent belongs to a Central American indigenous group such Maya, Nahua, Mixtec, or Purepecha. The list of different populations that end up being counted will be made public when results are released in 2011, said Michele Lowe, spokeswoman for the Census Bureau.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An accurate count is important to the indigenous groups themselves, and to the federal government, which allocates resources to state and local government according to the results.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Labor estimates indigenous migrants make up about 17 percent of the country&rsquo;s farm workers, and may represent up to 30 percent of California&rsquo;s farm worker population. Florida also has a large indigenous immigrant population.</p>
<p>Indigenous organizations are independently working within their own communities to dispel apprehension and encourage participation in the federal survey. They speak many different languages, making a single educational campaign impossible. Some speak Spanish; some not at all.</p>
<p>Many have encountered discrimination in their home countries because of their indigenous origin, and in this country for their immigrant status. All this makes them less likely to volunteer sensitive personal information to a government agency.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be counted as we are  &mdash;  as Mixtecos, Zapotecos, Triques,&#8221; said Rufino Dominguez, executive director of the organization [Binational Center for the Development of Oaxacan Indigenous Communities]. &#8220;It&rsquo;s important so everyone knows we are here, and that there are many of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Question 8 asks whether they consider themselves to be &#8220;of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin.&#8221; The next question asks their race. The Census recommends indigenous immigrants from Latin America choose &#8220;American Indian or Alaska Native&#8221; as their race, then write in the name of their community.</p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t have a problem with this. IMHO, the more categories, the better. At its root, the Census is means of data collection, and specific is always better than general.</p>
<p>But from a practical standpoint as this country moves toward a majority minority population, the wider people&rsquo;s ethnic allegiances are spread, the less of a threat any one minority group will be to the status quo.</p>

		<p>Suddenly, everyone wants their own category on the census.</p>
<p>Arabs want one, &#8220;indigenous immigrants&#8221; want one. Etc. They all want one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many have encountered discrimination in their home countries because of their indigenous origin&#8221;</p>
<p>YES, this is so? And if so, I hope they appreciate that even as mostly illegal aliens, they are treated better here than in their &#8220;home countries&#8221;.</p>

It seems to me as guests here in someone else&rsquo;s home, they should be glad for whatever they get; and it&rsquo;s for US to be telling THEM what WE want.</p>

		<p> I&rsquo;m sure there are wonderful unique things these particular natives have to cherish and preserve, pride in ones culture &hellip;is a good thing. A world where everyone was the same would be monotone. I have seen some of these Indigenous people in Mexico, I thought they had a dignified bearing.</p>

<p>These people are NOT indigenous to the United States and should not be referred to as such.  They are indigenous to Mexico and Central America.  They are &#8220;migrants&#8221; to the US. </p>
<p>Mr. Dominguez should pester the governments of the countries his people really belong in.  It is not our fault that their own nations do not want them and I feel no obligation to make room for the non-indigenous Indians.</p>

		<p>How about adding<br>

<p>So we can stop feeling guilt for being &#8220;white&#8221; and adopt our real heritage with pride. White is a color not a heritage. </p>
<p>While we are at it lets add a real minority<br>
    Italian American</p>
<p>only 9 million of us, vs. 15 million blacks and 50 million hispanics. </p>

<p>Exactly.  This is a cunning, slick propaganda term designed to convey the impression that they belong here and were here first. Before this term gets established, we should not let them slip it past us and get away with it.</p>
<p>Oh, and incidentally, I&rsquo;ll bet you anything that they didn&rsquo;t come up with this propaganda term all by themselves. No way. I&rsquo;m sure they had coaching from the Usual Suspects.</p>

<p> - - Why should they leave us alone when they can cross our borders illegally, get free medical care, jobs in construction and the service industry, get an apartment in a nice neighborhood and play music and make noise at all hours of the night and the neighbors are too afraid of saying anything for fear of looking &#8220;racist&#8221; or just fear of the illegals themselves, and even buy a house with little or no credit history?</p>
<p>Why should they leave us alone?  They know they&rsquo;ve got White people on the run.  They know it.</p>

		<p>As to poster #6, I too have met many native indians from mexico and south america and found them to be earnest, honest and more noble than the typical urban &#8216;latinos.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I also think the census should be expanded to allow every possible racial group to have a category (within reason) because how else are we going to know for sure how many whites are left?  I don&rsquo;t like that Arabs, turks, Afghans, North Africans, Central Asians and a lot of Latinos are counted as &#8220;white&#8221; by our government.  It makes them invisible and they don&rsquo;t like it and it also fools us into thinking we still have our country.</p>
<p>If the true number of whites would be known and officialy recognized, I think we would be much closer to only 50% of the population right now, and in many more areas, whites would be a minority.  </p>
<p>What are the benefits?  We can then claim minority status and fight for the civil rights of our people in this &#8216;multicultural&rsquo; (read: disfunctional) country.  Everyone else came in and took the spoils of our civilization while we were sleeping.  The only way we will ever get back our fair share is if we become a minority-conscious group, as well.  Then we can have our euro-centirc clubs in schools, out set-asides, our parades, etc&hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8216;&hellip;We want to be counted as we are &mdash; as Mixtecos, Zapotecos, Triques,&rsquo;&hellip; &#8216;It&rsquo;s important so everyone knows we are here, and that there are many of us&hellip;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My satanic California state tax bill let me know that you&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>You are welfare parasites, demanding that others like me pay for you, your children and the lifestyle you see on TV, in perpetuity.  You wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to call me a White, racist Nazis if I object  &mdash;  but I won&rsquo;t have to, soon, when the money dries up. </p>
<p>I must pay for translators when you are hauled into court because of your backwards ways  &mdash;  such as selling your 14-year old daughter to an 18-year old neighbor for 160 cases of beer.  Or when you insist on driving a car, something you have never done before, either drunk or high on drugs, and maim or kill someone.  </p>
<p>These things are a reflection of the culture your people created for you  &mdash;  they are abhorrent to us and we despise your Third World ways and your simplistic socialist views.  We resent your presence here, the fact that the US government allows you to be here and live amongst us  &mdash;  you are merely government pawns in a larger plan to displace NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS and steal their wealth.  But I don&rsquo;t expect you to understand this, it&rsquo;s too complicated for those of low IQ to comprehend.</p>
<p>I am forced to pay for, against my wishes and at the expense of my own children, the futility of an extremely expensive, first-world education for your many low IQ&rsquo;d children, many of whom will need &#8216;special ed&rsquo; and &#8216;special services&rsquo; at twice the cost; the rest will not succeed due to the limits of their low IQs.</p>
<p>I must pay the hospital bill for your 13-year old daughter when she drops her first anchor baby and the expensive hospital treatments her premature &#8216;American&rsquo; child will need, probably for life.  I also must pay the exorbitant bill when you bring your children to the emergency room with a stuffy nose or a slight fever.</p>
<p>I also am also forced to pay for your welfare, food stamps, housing, and high rates of crime because you do not fit into the First World. This civilization (well, what&rsquo;s left of it) was built by my White ancestors for their progeny as a reflection of our heritage, our values and our vision, not yours. </p>
<p>You arrogantly believe the entitlements you receive from the US government are free, but they are not.  Overburdened taxpayers of the US and the failed state of California pay for your lifestyle.  You are stealing my earnings, which belong to me and my children, not you.</p>
<p>And because of your insistence on living here and sponging off of us, the tax base is fleeing and the economy of California is on the verge of collapse. I doubt you understand any of this as economic literacy (or any other kind of literacy) is beyond your capabilities.</p>
<p>But you will understand when your welfare check, food stamps, AFDC, TANF and any other program that is based on Free White Money is cut off because there aren&rsquo;t any producers left  &mdash;  just government parasites like you who live off of the labor of others.</p>
<p>I hope this sham of an economy collapses, the sooner the better and let&rsquo;s get on with it.</p>
<p>Bon of Babble    <br>
