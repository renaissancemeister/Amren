			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dana DiFilippo and Ted Silary, Philadelphia Daily News, January 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Any seasoned high-school sports coach expects a few jeers and gibes from the stands, where many spectators are so young, their passion outweighs their politeness.</p>
<p>But the trash talk turned bloody outside Olney High School Thursday afternoon after sour fans of Olney&rsquo;s boys&rsquo; basketball team attacked the victorious Frankford players and coach in the parking lot after the game.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we came out as a team [to board the bus home], it was crazy. One of our [adult] fans got jumped right away; he got beat up pretty bad,&#8221; Frankford coach Ben Dubin said. &#8220;Everywhere you looked, there were fights going on, six to eight at a time. I got hit three times, [including] once to the face, but they didn&rsquo;t catch me flush.&#8221;</p>
<p>Player Omar Askia was hit so hard in the face his eye swelled shut, Dubin said. Player Harold Hicks went home with a bloody mouth after catching a sucker-punch, Dubin said. Olney fans even appeared to be fighting each other, he added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The violence came after escalating tension inside the gymnasium, where many spectators refused to sit in the stands, witnesses said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When a Frankford player dunked a ball, Dubin said, an Olney fan standing behind that basket growled at him: &#8220;Stop trying to disrespect our team. We&rsquo;re gonna f  &mdash;  - you up after the game!&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Refs finally ended the game with more than a minute left on the clock because unruly fans wouldn&rsquo;t cooperate, witnesses said. Frankford won, 74-51.</p>
<p>Police reported several disorderly-conduct arrests.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Witnesses agreed most of the misbehaving fans appeared to be Olney alumni and young adults from the neighborhood, and not current students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;My team and Frankford&rsquo;s team are all friends with each other. The kids for both teams played hard and acted like gentlemen,&#8221; said McKenna [Olney Coach Jeff McKenna], who also teaches history at Olney. &#8220;This was young adults from the neighborhood acting badly. It&rsquo;s not a basketball or even a school issue. It&rsquo;s just sad that they make us look bad.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This article has a good point.  When these kinds of fights break out after or during basketball games, it&rsquo;s never among or between players, it&rsquo;s the fools in the stands.  I think the reason is that basketball players know that hard fouls or dunks are all in the game, so they&rsquo;re used to it, even if the players are otherwise ghetto thugs.  The fans in the stands don&rsquo;t know better.</p>

		<p>Many decades ago, in Chicago, circa early 1960&rsquo;s, basketball game between Calumet high school [predominantly white at the time] and Dunbar high school [all-black]. Calumet wins. Fight starts after the game at the school [Calumet]. When I say &#8220;fight&#8221; what I mean is that blacks in the crowd of &#8220;fans&#8221; from Dunbar start beating the white kids in the crowd from Calumet. Finally the crowds are dispersed and all is &#8220;well&#8221;!</p>
<p>NOT exactly so. A carload of blacks, driving home, see two boys, brothers, walking along, wearing Calumet warm-up jackets. These two boys, brothers, are attacked without warning and stabbed to DEATH! Those two white boys were not at the game AND DID NOT EVEN HAVE AN INKLING OF WHAT WAS OCCURRING OR WHY!!</p>
<p>This from the early 1960&rsquo;s now!!</p>
<p>Later in the same day, someone calls into the radio WLS popular disc jockey Dick Biondi with a dedication to the two boys from Calumet from all the guys at Dunbar.</p>
<p>I have often wondered over the years if any of the perps were ever caught or punished. </p>
<p>Anyone else ever hear of this before?</p>

		<p>To Jeddermann (re post # 3):</p>
<p>I never heard of the incident you described. However, it wasn&rsquo;t just basketball games where Bantus would riot, if their teams lost. Football post -games could be ugly.</p>
<p>In the late 1960&rsquo;s, my brother and three of his friends were jumped by Mau Maus from Lindblom (all-Bantu school), after my brother&rsquo;s school team (Lane, mostly white) beat Lindblom in a city playoff game. My brother and his friends fought back against the Mau Maus (who were arrested), and appeared in court against them.</p>
<p>Jeddermann, I used to think that Bantus fought against whites whenever a Bantu team lost to a white team, in response to some taunting from the victors&rsquo; fans that must have taken place post-game. Now, I think it&rsquo;s because of an inferiority complex that Bantus have - they can&rsquo;t stand the &#8220;humiliation&#8221; of losing to whitey, ESPECIALLY in a sporting event, where they&rsquo;ve been told over and over again, how great the Bantu athlete is supposed to be. In their minds, if they lose to whitey in sports, then where in life do they have a &#8220;chance&#8221;?</p>
<p>Remember the howl raised by Bantus a few years ago when the &#8220;Survivor&#8221; program was going to segregate the teams into white, Asian, Hispanic and Bantu squads? Bantus screamed because they didn&rsquo;t want the world to see how they would fare against the other teams.</p>
<p>Just like the world is seeing how Haitians react to an earthquake. I saw stories on the MSM on the Net, where Haitian looters are actually cutting each other up with broken bottles, in disputes over rum and whiskey bottles they&rsquo;ve looted.     </p>

		<p>When the inferior are empowered, when the thugs are empowered, when courtesy and sportsmanship are abandoned and ridiculed, when values are taught by hip-hop lyrics, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN?  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to regain the high ground and beat down anyone lying about the benefit of regressive behavior and low intelligence.</p>
<p>Its time to teach morals, ethics, values, and stop the false self-esteem lifestyle founded on lies.  Get real.</p>
<p>It really is no different from the nba or the nfl on down.</p>

		<p>Check out that infamous Ohio State-Minnesota NCAA in 1972.  The white Buckeye team defeated the largely black Gopher team (at Minnesota) and wound up being assaulted on the court.  These were players, not fans.  It was a disgusting mass mugging.  The guilty Minnesota players should have prosecuted, not simply reprimanded by the NCAA. </p>

		<p>Just for the record, I am 99% certain that both teams are 100% black at this point.  Frankford probably still has a good number of white students but not on the basketball team.  It wasn&rsquo;t a race issue.</p>

		<p>The appropriate response to this incident would be for the school district to simply stop allowing Olney to play other teams in the area.  Of course this won&rsquo;t happen, as school district officials in the US have no backbone at all, except when it comes to expelling teenage girls for giving Tylenol to other teenage girls suffering from cramps, demanding warrantless urine tests from students for drugs, or demanding high school students perform unpaid community service as a prerequisite for graduation, as if being a teenager was somehow a crime that must be expunged in this fashion.  The actual safety of students at school events is not a priority at all.</p>

		<p>I recall when I played basketball in junior high and high school that it was the black teams who were the least sportsman-like of any of the teams we played. Also, if our team (a parochial school with no black team members) either won or lost by a few points that the black teams would throw rocks at us while we filed onto the bus to go home or invade our locker room for a free-for-all. Anything other than a one-sided victory would bring out their rage against us. I don&rsquo;t remember the fans ever being an issue.</p>

<p>And in many cases it is NOT EVEN STUDENTS OR PLAYERS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THESE &#8220;ALTERCATIONS&#8221;!! Blacks, not even students that attend the games with the intent JUST TO FIGHT [ATTACK] WHITEY!! And invade schools during school hours also to rob and attack whitey. Back a long time ago there was no such thing as badges and ID for students and such. The amount of mindless hate on the part of the Bantu is just so overwhelming!!</p>
