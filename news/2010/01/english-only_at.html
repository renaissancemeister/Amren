			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Newsmax, January 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A popular bookstore and cafe near Yale University wants its many Hispanic employees to speak only English around customers, sparking controversy in immigrant-friendly New Haven, where students fight for immigrant rights.</p>
<p>Atticus Bookstore and Cafe recently issued a policy stating that English should be the only language spoken on the floor and behind the counter. &#8220;Spanish is allowed in the prep area, the dishwasher area and the lower level. Let&rsquo;s make our customers feel welcome and comfortable,&#8221; the policy states, according to New Haven Workers Association, a group of activists who said employees gave them a copy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m really appalled,&#8221; said Tim Stewart-Winter, a Yale lecturer. &#8220;As a New Haven resident and member of the Yale community, I think diversity is a strength of this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stewart-Winter said he likes to take out-of-town guests to Atticus, but may not now because of the policy.</p>
<p>Bridget Pierpont, a 40-year-old New Haven resident, said she was texting a friend as she passed Atticus on Thursday suggesting they no longer go to the bookstore because of the language policy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Atticus owner Charles Negaro issued a statement saying his business appreciates and accepts all languages and offers free English language classes to employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;We encourage the use of English because it&rsquo;s an appropriate way to be most helpful to our customers,&#8221; Negaro said. &#8220;To continue to provide the best service possible, we try to help those employees who speak English as a second language by helping them improve their use of English.&#8221;</p>
<p>Negaro said news reports about the policy have been inaccurate and &#8220;if these news reports have offended anyone, I am sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most of those interviewed outside the bookstore disagreed with the policy. But Peter Indorf, who owns a jewelry store nearby, defended Negaro.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s a solid member of the community,&#8221; Indorf said. &#8220;He&rsquo;s entitled to do what he wants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deborah Malatesta, a member of the New Haven Workers Association, said the group plans to demonstrate Saturday in front of the bookstore. She said the policy is discriminatory.</p>
<p>The move comes in a city that was the first in the nation to offer identification cards to illegal immigrants. Yale Law School has been active fighting for immigrant rights, filing lawsuits over immigration raids conducted by federal authorities.</p>
<p>Employers are allowed to enact an English-only policy if it is needed to promote the safe or efficient operation of their business, according to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Examples include communications with customers, co-workers or supervisors who only speak English, emergency situations in which workers must speak a common language to promote safety and cooperative work assignments in which a common language is needed to promote efficiency.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>Well Tim, if &#8220;diversity is a strength to this country&#8221;, why this tempest in a teapot? I doubt that at this moment Mr. Negaro thinks that some of your legendary &#8220;strength&#8221; has inured to the Atticus where he was generous and broad minded enough to provide emplyment (a short supply commodity these days) to a critical mass of immigrants that have made this recent series of negative publicity events possible in the first place.</p>

		<p>Diversity as a construct has never been proven to have ANY intrinsic value and the fact it serves as the ultimate watchword of the radical crowd says all we need to know about the emptiness of policy pursuits which play to &#8220;diversity.&#8221;</p>

<p>As opposed to helping people find jobs&hellip;.?</p>
<p>There is a big difference between diversity (being different than on another) and requesting employees speak one language. Diversification is not contingent upon the latter. A Yale lecturer should know that.</p>

		<p>Just today I was shopping someplace and a question came up about my purchase.  The two employees conversed in Spanish in front of me, which I thought was rather rude - because I had no idea what they were saying.  What if I needed to interject important information?</p>

		<p>  Demand English only because you need to know what the employees are saying. <br>
  I do understand Spanish and have repeatedly had to deal with employees in businesses who were not doing their jobs but stalling because they thought it was funny, or making insulting comments about my companions or me, or obscene comments about the women with me, some of whom did understand and quickly got apologies and sometimes even sudden marriage proposals.<br>
  We should be able to know if the employees are trying to help us or are discussing robbing us.<br>

		<p>Well, this is my old home turf, New Haven county!  I have been waiting for the people of New Haven to ride that traitor mayor DeStefano out of town, tarred and feathered, on a rail.  Last I knew this city was heavily Italian, (great pizza) WHAT HAPPENED???  </p>
<p>If this man hired only english speaking employees, there would be no problem now.  If traitor DeStefano didn&rsquo;t make illegals so welcome there, there would not be so many.  The illegals have no intention of assimilating or becoming good citizens, they are here just to get all the freebies.  </p>
<p>As far as the Yalies are concerned.  They are from every corner of the world, spoiled, typical college kids who think they know everything.  Home of Skull &amp; Bones.  I remember seeing that building with no windows and wondering how odd it was.  If they think so much of these illegals, maybe they should offer to pay for their needs.  I wonder how they&rsquo;d like that idea.  These same people will eventually hire these illegals as nannies and lawn people and house cleaners.  What I have heard from a former client in Fairfield whose daughter is a stay-at-home mom, these people who hire these nannies who don&rsquo;t speak english are finding that their childrens&rsquo; english skills are sorely lacking when they start school.  How wonderful diversity is!  </p>

		<p>An employer should be able to institute any rules he wishes unless they create an unsafe working environment or break a contractual agreement.  Time in/time out, how to dress, how to treat customers, and what language to speak during working hours should all be the employers prerogative.  Employers have to spend so much money on nonsense and lawyers it is amazing anyone tries to be an entrepreneur.<br>

		<p>Spanish in the U.S. is not a mark of friendly and informed service.  It is vulgar, slang-ridden and ungrammatical.  It sounds hostile and insulting largely because its speakers are hostile and insulting, attributes which remain when they deign to speak English.  Desirable customers have a superabundance of choices.  They make the effort to visit retail stores for an experience which employees can enhance or degrade.</p>
<p>Have you been called &#8216;guy&rsquo; by a Spanish-speaking retail clerk?  If so, he or she was very likely calling you a homosexual, as &#8216;guy&rsquo; is the super secret code term for a homosexual.  The shelves are dusted, the products are competitively priced, the lighting is expertly arranged, and the clerk happily insults you.   </p>

		<p>Well, Tim baby, if diversity is a strength for this nation, why is it that the public schools are almost all Hispanic and black?  The smart folks - whites and Asians - go to private schools and do homeschooling.  If diversity is so great, why do people VOLUNTARILY segregate themselves BY RACE in public restaurants and cafeterias in Atlanta?  If diversity is so fabulous, why is the majority of crime committed by people of color?  (No it is NOT unfair police practice - people of color REALLY DO commit the majority of violent crimes!)  If diversity is such a wonderful reality in this country, why is it that in TV commercials, you see people of all races mingling together happily at private parties   &mdash;   but at REAL private parties, the guests are almost always of the same racial background?  Time for YOU to get real, Timmie; the world is not an Ivy-League theoretical concept.  People out here in reality want to pretty much stick to their own, and we want ALL the violent perpetrators, of ANY race, to be caught and punished by the law.</p>

		<p>Many Whites are not assertive enough when clerks or salespeople retreat into speaking Spanish with their co-workers. If you sense that they are not spending the time resolving your problem, don&rsquo;t hesitate to cut in. Make known that you don&rsquo;t have all day to listen to their babble. If it seems like it is taking longer than it should, then demand their attention. When you are done (either have transacted your business or gotten sick of being stalled), find the manager and explain to them that his staff just wasted &#8216;n&rsquo; minutes of your time. Suggest to them that they need to restrict their staff to speaking English in front of customers to assure respectful service.</p>
