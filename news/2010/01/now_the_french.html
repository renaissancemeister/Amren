<h1>Now the French Must Prove They&rsquo;re French</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bruce Crumley, Time, January 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Like his father before him, French publisher, author and political commentator Eric Naulleau was born into a military family assigned to a temporary foreign posting. But because his birth happened abroad, where his father  &mdash;  himself born in Lebanon to a French army father  &mdash;  was serving France&rsquo;s national interests, Naulleau has had to wage a long and surreal battle with the government to prove that he&rsquo;s actually a French citizen. Naulleau is just one of a growing number of French people born outside France or in the country to foreign parents who are now being told they must present documents supporting their nationality if they want to keep it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Why is this happening? For years, applicants for new passports and ID cards relied on their expiring documents to prove their identities and French nationality. But in the mid-1990s, the country started strengthening the verification requirements on suspicions that significant numbers of foreigners had made bogus claims of citizenship to obtain French passports. In the past few years, the rules have become even more stringent. According to the Justice Ministry, about 18,000 people, or 12% of all those who tried to renew their passports or ID cards, were rebuffed in 2007 because they didn&rsquo;t have irrefutable proof of nationality  &mdash;  up from 8,000 people, or 5%, in 2002.</p>
<p>Authorities say they are merely making necessary updates to the nationality verification process  &mdash;  not an illogical move, they note, in a world where terrorism and identity theft has become more commonplace. Perhaps, detractors say, but those French citizens born overseas or in France to foreign-born parents are facing a trial that their peers are not. While the latter group can often rely on the French state to check official records to prove their citizenship, people born in former French colonies to naturalized immigrant parents or to French families abroad are being subjected to a paper chase that often leads to dead ends. Many fear they may lose their French nationality altogether.</p>
<p>Concern has reached such a level that the French media are now sounding alarm bells. The daily Libération, for instance, ran a story on the issue Monday under the headline: &#8220;The French People That France Rejects.&#8221; Some reports have detailed the incredible lengths that these &#8220;rejects&#8221; have had to go through to obtain the required certificates of nationality for themselves, their parents and, at times, their grandparents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many pundits have denounced the dramatic stiffening of rules, saying it has coincided with the conservative-led government&rsquo;s recent obsession with immigration, the place of Islam in French society and the current state of French national identity. Critics argue that conservatives are trying to stoke nationalist sentiment to gain the support of right-wing voters. &#8220;In recent years, France has stopped its offensive of exporting its universal values globally, and shrunk into a defensive position that views everything outside it as threatening and corrupting,&#8221; Naulleau says. &#8220;That now even includes most foreign-born French people, though clearly not the big shots like [former president] Valéry Giscard d&rsquo;Estaing, who hasn&rsquo;t faced the same problems I have despite having been born in Germany, too.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>Note the deceptive headline of this story. They are trying to fearmonger French into dropping procedures to root out illegals and terrorists. So a few real French have to go through the hassle of proving their citizenship. Big deal.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sort of wondering if the &#8220;questionable&#8221; French citizens just happen to be Black Moroccans, Algerians, Sudanese and such from various and sundry former French African colonies who are anxious, NAY, DESPERATE to remain on the French Welfare tit.</p>

		<p>Do note that Libération is a leftist, &#8220;progressive&#8221; newspaper, generally associated with communist views, &#8216;though not specifically  with the Communist Party itself.  Oddly, it is under the financial control of  Édouard de Rothschild, but is still very much a radical left-wing publication, supporting such leftist causes as anti-racism, feminism, and immigrant rights.</p>
<p>Therefore, given that   &mdash;   it is hardly surprising that they have run a headline story on this  nationality issue,  &#8220;sounding bells&#8221; as the article puts it, and decrying the right-wing/conservative  &#8220;obsession with immigration&#8221;.  Hardly surprising at all.  What else would one expect from such a newspaper?</p>

		<p>Interesting the way they portray these measures as harming the ethnic French. They don&rsquo;t in reality but they do help stop bogus claims. A bit more form filling is a price worth paying, as the lengthy process involved in getting a Russian visa showed me when I saw the streets of Russia, don&rsquo;t let this article fool you.</p>

		<p>It seems strange to Americans that other nations do not accept or allow anchor babies. In fact, the US is alone among the nations of the world in allowing location of birth to determine nationality.</p>
<p>The more common case is Mexico. Article 30 of the Mexican Constitution states that persons born outside of Mexico are Mexican citizens if one or more of their parents are Mexican. (This would automatically make every anchor baby a Mexican citizen.)</p>
<p>We need a practical and wise rule&hellip;..that someone born in the US is a citizen of this country ONLY if one or more of their parents are ALSO (and ALREADY) an American citizen. No doubt this simple rule would save hundreds of millions in tax dollars in the years that follow.<br/>

<p>Yes!  Excellent idea.  And I take note of the interesting fact that those anchor babies are ALL considered Mexican citizens as well. </p>
<p>Therefore, a further clause should stipulate that American citizenship will not apply in cases where the baby already has another citizenship claim&hellip; that it must be either one or the other.  And if American citizenship is to be granted, then the parents must formally and legally renounce the other.</p>
<p>This whole dual-citizenship thing must be done away with.</p>
<p>Of course, this will get certain influential groups very upset and they&rsquo;ll fight it tooth and nail. Guaranteed!</p>

<p>I believe England has an anchor baby thing too, hence the impatience of Pakistanis to get into the Emerald Isles while in the later stages of pregnancy (or litter birthing) to get on the welfare tit.</p>
