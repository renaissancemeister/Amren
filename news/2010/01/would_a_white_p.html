<h1><a href="../../../../opinion/times/oped/index-ssf_/base/news-0/126440193377830.xml">Would a White President Better Serve Black America?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Donald Roscoe Brown, New Jersey On-Line, January 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} I&rsquo;m writing today to posit the question of whether  &mdash;  through the first year of the Obama presidential term  &mdash;  black Americans would have been more effectively served by having an individual in the Oval Office who was white. {snip}</p>
<p>Before I am accused of any black-on-black &#8220;crime&#8221; for even raising such a question (I am black), consider that in a Jan. 15 New York Times op-ed by Clyde Haberman, &#8220;For These Three, the Audacity of Nope,&#8221; the focus was on President Obama&rsquo;s reticence in supporting three black men who are/were contemplating their candidacies for mayor of New York City, governor of New York State, and U.S. senator from New York. (Those candidates are, respectively, William Thompson, who lost his bid in the November 2009 election; David Paterson, who was encouraged by the Obama administration not to run again; and Harold Ford Jr., who was also urged not to run.) {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} It&rsquo;s my postulation that black Americans are unjustifiably (perhaps even irreparably) compromised by not being able to politely engage the White House in public conversations about problems sometimes unique to Black America, because the top dog there is a black guy who seemingly thinks it would be impolitic to discuss such matters. Among those issues would be the unabated national epidemic of racial profiling of black men by law-enforcement personnel. The publicity attached to, for example, the unwarranted stops of black drivers by the New Jersey State Police and, most recently, the baseless arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates have brought additional focus on a practice that continues to unnerve black communities throughout America.</p>
<p>Next for consideration by the president could be the phenomenon by which, for example, black New Yorkers are seven times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession notwithstanding surveys that have demonstrated whites to be heavier users. Equally troubling is that in New Jersey, almost 80 percent of incarcerated men are black even though blacks don&rsquo;t commit that large a percentage of New Jersey&rsquo;s crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Problems such as these [including unemployment and economic vitality] could require substantial governmental response. And if prospective governmental response can&rsquo;t even get to the drawing board because the head man won&rsquo;t publicly discuss the underlying problems, why support having him in office?</p>

<p>And isn&rsquo;t His health plan just a transfer of benefits from Whites to other minorities?</p>
<p>No, I think Obama is doing exactly as He has wanted to  &mdash;  and many blacks are not able to see His subtle hand, or the results of His long-range goals.  </p>

<p>Indeed they would have, had it been the mindless race traitor Comrade McCain!</p>
<p>Of Comrade Hillary, I have my doubts. Given that she is said to be a vindictively seething individual, she may have turned on them like a supersonic viper. Remember, blacks overwhelmingly voted for him and against her in the primaries, and had there just been one or two more states swinging her way then, she would be the President of the USA now. If she and her appallingly superficial husband had not been so avidly mesmerized by the &ldquo;riches&rdquo; multiculturalism &ldquo;offered&rdquo; them politically earlier in 2008 and before that in the 90&lsquo;s, they may very well have destroyed the mulatto &ldquo;messiah&rdquo; with ease. Alas for them, they believed their own nonsense, until it was to late to stop it from becoming a &ldquo;dreamlike&rdquo; reality.</p>
<p>However, unlike Comrade McCain, when they sensed the danger they had conjured up, they were at least willing to attempt to manipulatively reverse it through moderately covert racial appeals to whites. Had it been done sooner and perhaps more overtly, Comrade Hillary may have had the chance to inflict some retribution on those &ldquo;communities of color&rdquo; who had opposed her so fervently, from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>
<p>In the end, we can ruefully only speculate about this now, in terms of what might have been.</p>
<p>General Secretary Obama&rsquo;s future on the other hand, remains fair game for the what might yet be speculations. Personally, I feel some oddly mixed portions of glee and grudging sympathy when doing so. He is in way over his head, there is no question of that; he is learning that rainbow symbolisms and fanciful speeches do not metaphysically transform reality, particularly in a crisis, the way they did excite greedy &ldquo;hope&rdquo; in the abscessed &ldquo;minds&rdquo; of the foolish and indolent voting blocks who elected him. </p>
<p>This absurd rant of Mau Mau Comrade Brown above illustrates this, all too plainly. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Astute members will recall that, during the election, people were wondering what the likes of al sharpton and jesse jackson would do if a black reached the highest office in the land. I think we have the answer. All they have done is complain and complain and then complain some more. Certain entities rely 100% on blacks being kept down and not even a black man in the white house is gonna slow them down.</p>

		<p>Black politicians traditionally cheat and steal from their black constituents.  They never really help them, other than to extort money from white state governments.  To do other wise would make the black ploitician an &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221;.</p>
<p>White politicians give them goodies to avoid charges of &#8220;racism&#8221; but do not actually help them in any meaningful way.  A white politician wouldn&rsquo;t dare address the real problems in the black community.</p>
<p>Hmmmm&hellip;.sounds like politicians are not the key to black success.<br/>

		<p>Note that it is not even permissible to ask which president would better serve white America.  Simply to ask that question would bring charges of white supremacy, neo-Nazism, and racial hatred.</p>
<p><i>Among those issues would be the unabated national epidemic of racial profiling of black men by law-enforcement personnel.</i></p>
<p>This &#8220;epidemic&#8221; exists solely in the minds of the white hating mass media.  Blacks get arrested more often because they commit crimes more often.  It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>
<p><i>The publicity attached to, for example, the unwarranted stops of black drivers by the New Jersey State Police </i></p>
<p>Another media myth.  Some academic did a study and found that blacks were stopped more often than whites simply because they did in fact commit traffic violations more often than whites.  On the highway a cop usually can&rsquo;t even tell the race of the driver before stopping the car anyway.</p>
<p><i>&hellip; the baseless arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates</i></p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a baseless arrest.  Somebody saw Gates break into his own home, thought he was a burglar, and called the cops.  When the police arrived Gates could have calmly and politely showed them his driver&rsquo;s license to show that he lived there.  Instead, Gates, Professor of Black Studies at Harvard, finally had a chance to prove how Black he is&hellip; he dissed the cops, ensuring that the confrontation would escalate into an arrest.</p>
<p><i>Problems such as these [including unemployment and economic vitality] could require substantial governmental response&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Nobody is stopping blacks from starting businesses in their own neighborhoods.  (And if any non-black tries that, he is hated as an interloper and a leech on the community.)  But as always black people think it&rsquo;s the government&rsquo;s job to solve their problems.  (If I waited for the government to solve my problems I&rsquo;d die of old age first.)  The one thing the government could do to improve the employment opportunities for black people would be to enforce the immigration laws.  But that would be racist.</p>

		<p>I have to admit that I am surprised that Obama does not act in a far more racially conscious manner than he does, judging by the extreme race consciousness of his autobiography. As Jared Taylor has said, it&rsquo;s hard to see any difference between Obama&rsquo;s policies and those of any other liberal in the White House. It must be the fact that he is surrounded by white advisers. If he had a black cabinet and a majority-black Congress, I&rsquo;m sure he would feel he could get away with a lot more than he currently does.</p>

		<p>&#8220;black New Yorkers are seven times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession notwithstanding surveys that have demonstrated whites to be heavier users.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because black New Yorkers are dumb enough to smoke it openly on street corners, while Whites stick to blazin inside.  Furthermore, you don&rsquo;t have to be a marijuana user to be arrested for possession.  There are people called dealers, a lot of whom happen to be black, unless Brownie let it slip his mind.</p>

		<p>While I do not agree with much of what the writer wrote, he does make one good point. If Obama wants to use our tax money to rebuild a country for his fellow &#8220;Blacks&#8221;, he might begin by rebuilding his own. After all, he is president of the US, not  president of Haiti.</p>

		<p>As the British cousins say: bollocks!</p>
<p>General Secretary Obamas entire agenda is designed to empower coloreds, especially Blacks, at the expense of Whites.</p>
<p>Obama is just doing this IMPLICITLY but it is clear that anytime there is a wealth transfer occurring (Health Care being the largest proposed one ever) it is always from Productive Whites to Parasitic Blacks!  </p>

<p>A: None of the above, because no how matter how much he did for them, they&rsquo;d still endlessly complain. </p>
<p>If you gave every black in the US a million $ they&rsquo;d whine that they should&rsquo;ve received a billion. </p>

		<p>What universe is this man living in? He thinks racial profiling is one of the biggest woes of black America? Is he SERIOUS!!?? If Obama needs to focus on anything it would be gang violence, drug dealing, the AIDS epidemic, the high school drop out rate, and absent fathers among black children. </p>
<p>Then he has the gall to say black men are incarcerated at a higher percentage than whites, even though they don&rsquo;t commit that large a percentage of crimes? So they are locked up for the hell of it?</p>
<p>Who is he to blame Obama for not addressing underlying problems, when HE can&rsquo;t even be honest about what they are?</p>

		<p>This writer trots out the same bromide of &#8220;government action&#8221; in response to the high Bantu unemployment rates. Throwing more government money after a problem that&rsquo;s largely the result of the collapse of the private sector in the economy.</p>
<p>Then too, he claims that 80% of prisoners in New Jersey cans are Bantus, even though they don&rsquo;t commit that large a percentage of New Jersey&rsquo;s crimes. How would he know? He offers no evidence to back his claims. I&rsquo;ll bet most of the Bantus in the can come from Newark and Camden, with some even from Philadelphia. These cities are mainly Bantu. </p>

		<p>This writer begins with the premise that U.S. blacks might be better served with a non-black Prez and then goes, knee-jerk, into the same old whine about racial profiling, etc.  I suppose he would prefer a white, bleeding-heart, far-left loon who blames everything on whitey and racism.  This will not solve the problems &#8220;unique to blacks&#8221; anymore than anything else ever has.  The real problem American blacks have is that 20% of them have IQ&rsquo;s of 70 or below and practically no one with power or influence is willing to say so.  People keep spouting the same old, tired nonsense about why so many languish in ghettos.  Barack the Messiah cannot change this, Bill Clinton couldn&rsquo;t, and that&rsquo;s that.  But blacks like this writer continue to blame one thing and then another, when the only thing that blacks can do to even alter their unique problem is to gain more respect from other ethnic groups by admitting the truth.</p>
