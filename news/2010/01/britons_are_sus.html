			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Wynne-Jones, London Telegraph, January 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than half the population would be strongly opposed to a mosque being built in their neighbourhood, the study found.</p>
<p>A large proportion of the country believes that the multicultural experiment has failed, with 52 per cent considering that Britain is deeply divided along religious lines and 45 per cent saying that religious diversity has had a negative impact.</p>
<p>Only a quarter of Britons feel positive towards Muslims, while more than a third report feeling &#8220;cool&#8221; towards them.</p>
<p>The findings, to be published later this month in the respected British Social Attitudes Survey, show that far greater opposition to Islam than to any other faith and reveal that most people are willing to limit freedom of speech in an attempt to silence religious extremists.</p>
<p>David Voas, professor of population studies at Manchester University, who analysed the data, said that people were becoming intolerant towards all religions because of &#8220;the degree to which Islam is perceived as a threat to social cohesion&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Muslims deserve to be the focus of policy on social cohesion, because no other group elicits so much disquiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;size and visibility&#8221; of Islamic communities has led to serious concerns about their impact on British society, Prof Voas concludes.</p>
<p>&#8220;This apparent threat to national identity (or even, some fear, to security) reduces the willingness to accommodate free expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Opinion is divided, and many people remain tolerant of unpopular speech as well as distinctive dress and religious behaviour, but a large segment of the British population is unhappy about these subcultures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Researchers interviewed 4,486 people for the survey, which is published annually by the National Centre for Social Research. They found that respondents with no qualifications were twice as likely to have negative attitudes towards Muslims as with those who had degrees.</p>
<p>The report describes a high level of unease regarding the UK&rsquo;s Muslim population, estimated at around two million, with many people considering that it poses a threat to the nation&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>While 55 per cent say that they would be &#8220;bothered&#8221; by the construction of a large mosque in their community, only 15 per cent would be similarly concerned by a large church.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the research found considerable suspicion towards those of any faith who hold deeply religious views, while there was a widespread reluctance to see matters of faith intruding into the public sphere.</p>
<p>Nearly half (45 per cent) of Britons believe that laws and policy decisions would be worse if more politicians were deeply religious  &mdash;  almost double the number who think that they would be better.<br/>

<p><br/>
It is no surprise to me that the attitude of (white) Britons toward Muslims is shifting toward suspicion, yet when I read articles like this I&rsquo;m always baffled why Britons don&rsquo;t turn their concerns into a vote for the only party that is willing to stand against the causes and side effects of multiculturalism, namely the British National Party. (If, according to the statistics, most of those who are suspicious toward Muslims voted for the BNP, the party would quickly become a leading political power). Is it because people are reluctant to face the process of change, or because there still persists the notion of BNP being &#8220;fascist&#8221; and &#8220;extrimist&#8221; despite their agenda that is focused on preservation of Britain and her culture?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Many Brits believe that multiculturalism has failed.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder if they reached that conclusion because it so obviously has failed.</p>
<p>And, I wonder how many whites realized that it wouldn&rsquo;t work to begin with?</p>
<p>Only mentally challenged airheads and those among the mentally disturbed ever thought it was a good idea.</p>
<p>But, just remember, failure is no reason for a leftist loony to reject a pipe dream.  I mean, the entire concept was probably arrived at by many of them in an altered state of consciousness anyway, under the influence of drugs.</p>

		<p>Did the Brits ever VOTE for a multiculural/racial society in the first place? Of course not. So how can the media now say the people believe it isn&rsquo;t working? Of course it isn&rsquo;t. Never was intended to work to begin with.</p>
<p> It was pushed on them through sheer government FORCE, just like in the USA and in all White nations. The only solution for any of us to survive the onslaught is full deportation since keeping the millions they were forced to take in and all of their offspring will never work. How can it? We all see what has happened to all of our nations because of this and nothing short of massive expulsion will save the White race in any of these nations.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;The report describes a high level of unease regarding the UK&rsquo;s Muslim population, estimated at around two million, with many people considering that it poses a threat to the nation&rsquo;s identity.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And, of course, the Muslims presently occupying United Kingdom territory have done nothing at all to invite this high level of unease amongst other citizens in the Country.  Jihadists are the real victims and their terrorist activities and hate-filled and murderous rantings are entirely misunderstood by the <i>racist</i> white host nation!!!!</p>
<p>As for the <i>2 million</i> Muslim population estimation, just how dumb and stupid do the ruling elite think the general public are!!</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Researchers interviewed 4,486 people for the survey, which is published annually by the National Centre for Social Research. They found that respondents with no qualifications were twice as likely to have negative attitudes towards Muslims as with those who had degrees.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Those with degrees would be them who consider themselves Middle Class, who tend to be overwhelmingly Marxist Liberal by political persuasion and, therefore, witless followers of the multi-cult rainbow nation utopia fantasy.  No surprises there then!  In fact, their ilk is half the reason the United Kingdom is in such dire straits in the first place with Civil War now fast becoming a looming reality.<br/>

		<p>So the Brits have decided to not believe in multiculturalism any more?  Is that like finding out the Tooth Fairy isn&rsquo;t real, or Santa Claus either?

<p><br/>
The wording here is unforgivably ambiguous. Limit WHOSE freedom of speech? Just the extremist Muslims? Or ALL Britons? The distinction is crucial. I&rsquo;ve got no problem with limiting freedom of speech for hostile, conquest-minded invaders who shouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed entrance in the first place   &mdash;   but NOT for everybody. </p>
<p>Does that mean I&rsquo;m advocating one set of rules for an indigenous European population; and a second, harsher set of rules for immigrants? Yes, I suppose it does. </p>

		<p>When anyone tells you multiculturalism is a success, ask them what a FAILED multicultural society would look like. They will invariably reel off a bunch of outcomes that already exist in society.</p>
<p>Next, ask them to provide a single report or study conducted anywhere in the world that proves multiculturalism works, or that diversity is a &#8216;strength&rsquo;. They won&rsquo;t be able to, of course, despite the fact that universities and governments have been pushing this ideology for decades and have had ample time and resources to prove it. Then point to thousands of studies about racism and discrimination and ask them why this doesn&rsquo;t count as evidence AGAINST the validity of multiculturalism.</p>

<p>It is very frightening that even now so many British people are &#8216;cool&rsquo; about the menace of pagan Islam.</p>
<p>It is noticeable, too, what a good job the atheistic Left has done in using Islam to smear the Christian faith upon which western civilisation is based:</p>
<p>&#8216;Nevertheless, the research found considerable suspicion towards those of any faith who hold deeply religious views, while there was a widespread reluctance to see matters of faith intruding into the public sphere.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Like the Brits were willing to accept more gun-control? Look how that turned out.</p>
<p>I thought freedom of speech was already severely limited in Britain. Just ask Nick Griffin and Mark Collett. They spoke the truth and were arrested for it.</p>

		<p>It is a good thing that the MSM in Britain has started to write such articles. Things are bad in Britain yes, %30 vote turnout, fast breeding Muslims, and anti white employment laws are bringing us down. On the other hand, average Joe public has had some serious eye openers over the past 3 years, the BNP is virtually mainstream now, people in general are fed up with Muslims, high crime rates from blacks, and being put to the back of the housing que. It&rsquo;s not too late. <a href="http://northfieldpatriot.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://northfieldpatriot.blogspot.com/</a></p>

		<p>And this suspiciousness is healthy and natural. Nothing to feel guilty about. These non-European islamic invaders (along with all other non-White invaders) have no right to stay in the U.K. or for that matter anywhere in Europe. Removing them all from Europe (incl. Russia) and removing European troops in return from Afghanistan and Iraq will solve a huge load of unnecessary problems. No more &lsquo;invade the world, invite the world&rsquo; stupidity, it should be keep the world out and stay out of the (brown-black) world as much as possible.</p>

		<p>It looks like average, middle class Brits are waking up to the fact that the future they want for their country doesn&rsquo;t matter. </p>
<p>The Labour Party&rsquo;s hold on power was long enough to import a mass of third worlders - a new voting bloc that guarantees Labour&rsquo;s majority status for a generation, at which point indigenous Brits will just be one minority among others.</p>
<p>Labour betrayed England. It&rsquo;s difficult to see a way back for white indigenous England except through forcible expulsion of non-indigenous groups, an unlikely scenario.</p>

		<p>Same as in Spain: a town in central Catalonia (Vic) which passed from nearly 0% immigration in 1995 to 20% in 2005 is now the major center of attention in the country. The council tries to pass a bill that would not let domicile illegal immigrants in town. In Spain, if you domicile yourself in town you have access to health insurance, school, etc.. and it is SO EASY to domicile in some towns (you only need a gas, telephone bill). So the council says: if you don&rsquo;t have papers, that is, you come here as an illegal, we can&rsquo;t provide you with free health, school, etc AND the major parties are stating that such a legislation is unconstitutional and bla bla, media is almost lynching the council. However, polls reflect that people support such measures. Seems that something is changing towards immigration policies&hellip;</p>
