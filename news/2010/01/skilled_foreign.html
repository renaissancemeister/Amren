<h1><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9D2CN2G0.htm">Skilled Foreigners Must Get UK Identity Cards</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Business Week, January 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New regulations that took effect Wednesday require skilled foreign workers who extend their stay in Britain to obtain identity cards containing biometric data, including finger prints and photographs.</p>
<p>The UK Border Agency rules are part of the extended rollout of a 2008 program that will require all foreign workers who plan to stay in Britain six months or longer to obtain an ID card by April 2011.</p>
<p>The rules apply only to workers from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland.</p>
<p>British officials say the ID cards for foreign workers will help combat illegal workers and illegal immigration and allow cardholders to establish their identity and immigration status, making it easier for them to access various benefits they are entitled to.</p>

		<p>As I read it, unskilled laborers and the like will not be subject to these regulations. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a step in the right direction.  However, skilled workers are the immigrants we WANT to attract.  We gotta do the same for the unskilled ILLEGAL immigrants that we don&rsquo;t want or need.  My bumper sticker says, &#8220;BUILD A WALL and DEPORT THEM ALL!!&#8221;  Of course it isn&rsquo;t on my car - it&rsquo;s on the bulletin board in my bedroom; I am not suicidal.</p>

		<p>Almost any white person has the propensity to become a &#8220;skilled worker&#8221;.</p>
<p>Most non-white &#8220;skilled workers&#8221; are frauds&hellip;..unable to do the job, no matter what it is. There are a handful of exceptions (any lie requires a grain of truth)&hellip;.but only a handful.</p>
<p>Basically what is going on here is INSTEAD of stopping ALL immigration and kicking most immigrants, especially criminal ones, out of the country, unqualified non-whites are being brought in with various phony, unearned credentials and given affirmative action jobs.  Doctors who have no idea even about the basics of medicine.  Programmers who can&rsquo;t write code.  Professors who can&rsquo;t speak english and know little about their subject, even if they did&hellip;.on and on and on.</p>
<p>Qualified whites are then fired from their jobs and replaced by these chuckleheads.  And the government and point at their &#8220;papers&#8221; and say everything is on the up and up.</p>

		<p>If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, the UK already routinely fingerprints anyone, foreign or not, arrested for anything. In Italy, all immigrants must submit fingerprints to obtain a residence visa, and in most European countries everyone has to produce ID if the police ask for it. The difference between the feared &#8220;identity card&#8221; and its American proxy, the driver&rsquo;s licence, seems mostly semantics to me.</p>
