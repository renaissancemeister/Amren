<h1><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article6974036.ece">Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s Tribe Threatens President Jacob Zuma</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Times of London, January 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The king of Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s tribe is threatening to secede from South Africa after being convicted of manslaughter, kidnap and assault.</p>
<p>King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, who is Mandela&rsquo;s nephew, says he will declare independence and lay claim to 60% of the country&rsquo;s territory unless President Jacob Zuma withdraws the charges for which he faces a 15-year jail sentence.</p>
<p>The threat is deeply embarrassing to the ruling African National Congress because the king&rsquo;s Thembu tribe are one of the largest constituents of the Xhosa group  &mdash;  from which many ANC leaders have come. Mandela&rsquo;s grandson, Mandla, a Thembu chief, is one of the king&rsquo;s strongest supporters.</p>
<p>The king is on bail pending an appeal against his sentence on charges stemming from violence against his subjects in the early 1990s, during which a woman and children were kidnapped, homes burnt and youths assaulted, one of whom died.</p>
<p>He says his relationship with the Zuma government has &#8220;irretrievably broken down&#8221; and is demanding an apology and damages of Â£6.75 billion for his tribe, to be paid by Wednesday.</p>
<p>His territorial claims include Cape Town, the Eastern Cape, Johannesburg and the whole of KwaZulu-Natal, including Durban. This last is a deliberate insult to Zuma and his Zulu tribe. The king has had a controversial career since he took the crown in 1992. Mandela, when president, told him that he was &#8220;not fit to rule&#8221; and, according to the king, tried to have him overthrown. However, Mandela, who was brought up as a ward of the Thembu royal court, is respectful of traditional institutions and was in proud attendance when Mandla was made a chief.</p>
<p>While Zuma will probably ignore the king&rsquo;s threat  &mdash;  the president is due to marry a fifth wife this week  &mdash;  the king&rsquo;s imprisonment could inflame Xhosa resentment against the dominance of Zulus under Zuma.</p>
<p>&#8220;Modern, urbanised Thembu are fed up with the king,&#8221; said Gavin Stuart, former editor of the East London Daily Dispatch, &#8220;but rural Thembu will see the prosecution of the king as a case of political persecution by a Zulu-led cabal.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Wait till the civil war and it is all blamed on whites. It&rsquo;s important not to hurt anyone&rsquo;s feeling. At least, anyone who counts as a person. Not hurting anyone&rsquo;s feelings is much more important than the truth. </p>

<p>And just remember, it is all because of &ldquo;the legacy of&rdquo; Apartheid.</p>
<p>The stupidest thing the West overall and the USA in particular ever did, was to demand one &ldquo;man&rdquo; one vote in South Africa. If they, our wretchedly feckless &ldquo;leaders,&rdquo; had only allowed for a  restrained racially quadri-cameral parliamentary system, and ongoing white judicial and executive control over that country, things would be different. </p>
<p>Alas, Babylon of the Bantus!</p>

		<p>Actually this might be a good thing.  Multi-cultral societies break up anyway so why not SA?  If the Xhosa get their independence the Afrikaners would have a stronger argument for independence.</p>
<p>I am surprised, however, at the sentence of only 15 years for manslaughter, kidnapping and assault.  Those seem to be rather serious crimes.</p>

Why!! blacks that commit the same crimes here in the U.S. don&rsquo;t get proportional sentences, IF they are sentenced at all.</p>

		<p>I hope the Xhosa-Zulu dispute escalates into open warfare like the Hutu-Tutsi fighting in Rwanda and Burundi, or the Congolese fighting during the 1960&rsquo;s. What we could be seeing is South Africa&rsquo;s version of the Crips v. the Bloods. The deplorable part is, pundits will blame the &#8220;legacy of apartheid&#8221;, or &#8220;the West&#8221; for the conflict.</p>
<p>FIFA should no longer delay, and move the World Cup to another country. It can cite security concerns and a deteriorating political situation. FIFA can&rsquo;t guarantee the safety of the foreign visitors, the new South Africa certainly won&rsquo;t and it would be ludicrous for foreign visitors to go to South Africa, only to find themselves in a country plunged into civil war.</p>
<p>Let the festivities begin!</p>

		<p>The black people in South Africa are the tribes that were driven the furtherest South by the stronger Nigerian tribes.  The stronger Zulu tribe has driven other smaller tribes into mountains and further South-which are the Xhosa&rsquo;s.  It can be rightfully pointed out that they were the weakest of all the black tribes. During apartheid the Zulus most often did not adhere to stay aways and marches.  They are a very hard working tribe in contrast to the Xhosas. Geographically in the latest South African Atlas the Zulu speaking people are the largest group in SA followed by the Afrikaans speaking people (which include people of mixed race)</p>
<p>I personally think the Zulu rule in SA is far more pro -Afrikaner <br>
than the Mbeki- Xhosa rule.  I have to smile because we witnessed the frantic swing in support by  liberal whites who `bought favors` for their businesses from the Mbeki-crowd to try and switch to the Zuma crowd!</p>

		<p>The solution to the problems in South Africa is actually quite simple really.</p>
<p>Whites need to separate themselves out from the population of blacks.  All move to one area of the country and deny blacks any access to that part of the country whatsoever.</p>
<p>If they simply choose to do this, there is literally no one to stop them.  The government is a joke with no real power to do anything.  They lack even the most basic ability to act cohesively is the issue.</p>
<p>One simple basic rule is all it takes to return &#8220;south africa&#8221; to normalcy and prosperity&hellip;..no blacks allowed.</p>
<p>The whites of south africa MUST learn from their past mistakes.  They built a society and half imposed it and half gave it away to blacks out of a misguided belief that they could live together.</p>
<p>It took incredible amounts of effort and, let&rsquo;s be honest here, FORCE, to make the situation work.  When whites lost interest in that, blacks quickly took over and destroyed everything.  Whites are builders.  Blacks are destroyers.  It has NEVER been any different.</p>
<p>Or perhaps a better way to look at it is blacks are not capable of living with civilization unless forced into it.  They never built one.  They never even really joined another.  They were coerced.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to stop forcing them to do something that is against their nature.  It&rsquo;s wrong&hellip;.and that has consequences for the ones attempting it.  it simply isn&rsquo;t their way of being in the world.</p>

		<p>&#8220;His territorial claims include Cape Town, the Eastern Cape, Johannesburg, and the whole of KwaZulul Nata, including Durban.&#8221;</p>
<p>If this idiot ever read a history book (and a doubt that he can even read) he would know that NO blacks were native to those regions at any point in history.  They migrated down from the north after, as is always the case, the whites cultivated these areas into hospitable living spaces.  His (Dalindyebo&rsquo;s) attitude is just textbook African  &mdash;  they see something that is nicer than what they have, and regardless of who it actually belongs to, unconcerned with anything but their own immediate urges, they &#8220;claim&#8221; it by intimidation or outright force.  They have absolutely no natural sense of right and wrong.  They behave like permanent children and never grow out of it.  This simply cannot last much longer.  No social engineering, however clever or concentrated, can break the ultimate laws of nature.  Whites and blacks evolved separately and were meant to live separately and nature decides who is fight to survive.  This is natural genetic destiny.        </p>

		<p>I would not get too excited about this. Just more posturing by a clown.  There will be no secession, and no civil war. Not yet, and not about this.</p>
<p>#11 Anon, that &#8220;simple solution&#8221; was called Apartheid, and was opposed by literally the whole world until it became unsustainable.  </p>
<p>Even on a limited scale, it is not practicable. There has been talk about an Afrikaner homeland in the Western Cape. Historically there were few Africans in that region.  Since the fall of civilization, however, they have been pouring in, encouraged by the government who would like to establish ANC voting majorities there in order to take over the local government structures.</p>
<p>A group of Afrikaners established a new town called Orania in a desert region, where they could live with their own culture. A black squatter camp (shantytown) sprang up 25 miles away. The government then proclaimed the two settlements a single municipality (with a majority of voters in the squatter camp). The local government minister explained that &#8220;it&rsquo;s a matter of making the best use of the available resources&#8221;. In other words, the white taxpayers are a resource that the black majority can exploit to build houses for themselves.</p>
<p>That is the fatal flaw of democracy. That is why I fear for America. </p>

<p>Istvan (commenter #5), that is actually a rather brilliant analysis, and one I can&rsquo;t believe hasn&rsquo;t gained traction. It&rsquo;s so obvious when you think about it! It both encompasses a historical fact (multiculturalism always results in conflict, and if you know anything about Africa, it&rsquo;s that the tribe comes first) and a plausible way for us whites to exploit it. This really is the only plausible hope whites have in South Africa. They won&rsquo;t break off on their own - they&rsquo;ve already gone from being over half of the population to 9%. South African whites are the boiled frog that will die out unless they are jolted to action. The only thing that can do that at this point is war, and they are too content with slow extinction to bring this on themselves. So: if the Xhosa and Zulus start a civil war and there is a push for separatism, whites will be forced to act. They could make the right move and make their own free state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long shot, but it is also their only hope (apart from simply expatriating entirely).</p>

<p>True, but without the Whites, the ANC would face economic disaster. They can see what happened when blacks ethnically cleansed Whites from Zimbabwe. I suspect the ANC would rather plunge the new SA into civil war and/or dictatorship rather than let the Whites go. </p>
