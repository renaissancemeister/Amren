<h1><a href="http://www.dolanmedia.com/view.cfm?recID=552049">Williamsburg County Schools Settle With Students Over Same-Race Discrimination</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fred Horlbeck, Dolan Media, December 28, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two Williamsburg County students and members of their family have reached a $150,000 settlement in what may be the first Title VI lawsuit based on claims of intra-racial discrimination in South Carolina public schools.</p>
<p>Lawrence &#8220;Larry&#8221; Kobrovsky, a Charleston attorney who focuses his practice on constitutional law and school issues, said the parties settled after a female student&rsquo;s claims of sexual and racial harassment at a Salters school went to trial in U.S. District Court in Florence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Both students were members of an African-American family that shared a home in rural Williamsburg County. Both attended public schools at the time of the alleged harassment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The cases were Gasque, et al. v. Williamsburg County School District et al., Civil Action No. 4:07-CV-01757-RBH; and Gasque v. Williamsburg County School District, et al., Civil Action No. 4:07-CV-1765-RBH.</p>
<p>&#8220;What made this unique is that this, as far as I know, is the only Title VI case ever brought in federal court when it&rsquo;s an intra-racial hostile environment,&#8221; Kobrovsky said.</p>
<p>Title VI prohibits allowing a racially hostile educational environment in schools and programs receiving federal financial assistance and provides for a private cause of action for violations.</p>
<p>The younger student {snip} claimed she suffered emotional trauma because she was subjected to racial and sexual slurs at an elementary school in Salters during September and November 2006. She had to receive home instruction for the rest of the school year, according to an amended complaint.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Acting white&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Proving intra-racial discrimination was a matter of portraying the environment cultural and racial at the students&rsquo; respective schools, Kobrovsky said.</p>
<p>Both students were African-American, and so was most of the elementary school&rsquo;s student body, according to Kobrovsky. Most students were also black at the high school that her uncle attended.</p>
<p>The problem was the culture of rural Williamsburg County, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a culture where to act like you want to do well in school is considered acting white. And that is part of why we&rsquo;re saying that it was racial, even though the students were all of the same race because they weren&rsquo;t acting how the others thought they should be acting as members of that race,&#8221; Kobrovsky said.</p>
<p>The uncle testified that racial separation in the county generally meant white students attended private schools while black students attended public schools.</p>
<p>At the public schools, he said, fitting in meant not being what his family was: &#8220;churchy,&#8221; &#8220;upright&#8221; and wanting education, as another witness put it, according to a trial transcript.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, it&rsquo;s a crime to act white, or it&rsquo;s a crime to be white,&#8221; the uncle testified.</p>
<p>Harassment, he testified, made him feel that &#8220;we are just dumb, we&rsquo;re just not people, we&rsquo;re undergraded, we&rsquo;re degraded, and we&rsquo;re not even supposed to be in this world.&#8221;</p>
<p>That testimony was the key to the settlement, Kobrovsky said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the most compelling part was his, and that&rsquo;s, frankly, why it&rsquo;s settled after he testified,&#8221; Kobrovsky said.</p>

		<p>Surreal. As bizarre as the story is, it inadvertently confirms the notion that many black families are actively hostile towards education. It&rsquo;s not going too far to say that black American culture intentionally resists formal education. </p>
<p>As good as their intentions might be, liberal white pols will never be able to change these attitudes - the change must come from within that culture. Until that happens, throwing more and more money after a population that hates education is nothing but a waste and a burden on middle class white taxpayers.</p>

		<p>Underclass blacks are fiercly anti-intellectual, violent and hostile, yet white liberals and black apologists will still insist that white &#8220;racism&#8221; is reason why blacks cannot achieve in academics.  One day people will realize that the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement did more damage to black culture than anything else.</p>

		<p>So white taxpayers had to pay a black family $150,000 because a black kid picked on a black kid?  Shouldn&rsquo;t the miscreant&rsquo;s family pay?</p>

<p>You could also argue that black culture had done more damage to black culture than anything else. I&rsquo;d be content to leave blacks alone to self destruct,but a bunch of tax collectors with a bunch of guns don&rsquo;t seem to share my point of view.</p>

		<p>When I was teaching 1st grade in a largely-black school, an angry black father came to me and said a girl who was darker than his son called his boy a &#8220;N&#8221;-word.  He demanded to know what I would tell the kid if he were mine (I&rsquo;m white).  I said, &#8220;I&rsquo;d teach him to deal with it - these things do happen, we can&rsquo;t control what other people say, so it&rsquo;s important for him to know that he didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong - it was the fault of the other kid, and she would be punished.&#8221;  The father came unglued when I said &#8220;deal with it&#8221; - he told the principal I was racist and had his kid taken out of my class.  I told the principal that if that was the man&rsquo;s mind-set, I was glad he was gone.  She wasn&rsquo;t too happy either - but it was black-on-black offense, so there wasn&rsquo;t much of anything else to be said.  I still contend I was right; that the father was a jerk and only wanted someone to blame, which he proceeded to do.  But I bet his kid DID in fact have to learn to deal with it - if it happened in grade 1, well, it was a long time until grade 12, and SOMEWHERE along there somebody was going to let loose with an N-word at this &#8220;light-skinned&#8221; black kid.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s funny is that this &#8216;education&rsquo; pretty much consists of highlighting the great things blacks have done despite the constant adversity they face, and of course doing the same, highlighting white greed and evil. The old &#8216;black = good, white = bad&rsquo;.  </p>

		<p>So, now that blacks - with the threat of lawsuits - have cowered whitey into avoiding any situation in which they could be accused of discrimination, they are now suing each other for racial discrimination.  Unbelievable.  And white taxpayers will be footing the bill.</p>

		<p>I believe that most underclass blacks do realize their status as to intelligence and drive, and they know that the rest of society, including other blacks, look down on them.  Half a century ago, they dealt with this just as any of us deal with deficiencies.  But, for decades now, they&rsquo;ve been told they can be anything they want to be.  They&rsquo;ve been told that all their problems are due to racism, but that now a messianic black Prez can cure all ills. <br>
I read recently that an old black woman in SA, on election day, swept off an area of ground for the new house Mandela would build her.  She was sitting there waiting.  A young woman in Harlem said much the same about Obama.  Such folks are subject to magical thinking, and when their dreams don&rsquo;t materalize, we get more and more violence.</p>

		<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s actually pretty funny, that now that we have those &#8220;reverse&#8221; discrimination lawsuits, that whites are being discriminated against, that blacks have to jump on that bandwagon, and get rich off someone discriminating against them because they say they ACT white!  Is there no end to their scheming to get unearned money?</p>
<p>I wonder if a &#8220;wigger&#8221; can sue the school system if another white kid calls him a honky.</p>

		<p>In things like this.. the white race is held hostage by blacks. First blacks prostituted themselves to us century&rsquo;s ago (black slavers)&hellip;then the civil war&hellip; and since then the national strife.. of trying to cohabit two people not meant to be on the same continent. Since the civil rights thing some whites have been ghettoized in immitation of the rythmic race others have chewed their economic paws off trying to escape the loss of realestate devaluation of blacks coupled with their lawyers, coming into the area. With forced busing whites again flew like the wind to recreate new enviroments where their children could be raised amongst others of their own kind.  There are of course good black people&hellip; but I think whites better get some spine and realize that they will be debased by cohabiting with what nature seperated. The old testament is a large contrast to the new in (subject matter)&hellip;. And I think this needs to be taken into account&hellip;Redemption is I think, open to all&hellip; and in this (spiritual) sense there is neither male nor female..slave or free&hellip;It would follow nor black or white.. Outside of this however&hellip;the old testament was perfectly fine with advocaying seperation between different races (biologically) in order to preserve particular seed*</p>

		<p>To expand on what Istvan wrote:</p>
<p>First the white taxpayers had to shell out for public schools for blacks w/no interest in learning.</p>
<p>Then the white families in Williamsburg had to pay for expensive, segregated private schools to protect their children.</p>
<p>Now they have to pick up the $150,000 tab for a frivolous lawsuit where blacks claim that other blacks are prejudiced against them!</p>
<p>These people sure are living beyond our means! <br>

		<p>In the future, I wonder if it would be cheaper for the state of South Carolina to test the IQ&rsquo;s these kids who are &#8220;acting white&#8221;. If they are above 100, maybe it would be in the taxpayers best interest to send them off to a private boarding school (out of state or at least out of the area). $150,000 could have put these kids through a good high school and college. </p>
<p>The state of South Carolina is having a heck of a time trying to recruit and retain qualified teachers in rural areas. Unlike a lot of the country, in SC there are a large percentage of blacks in rural areas. I&rsquo;m sure that lawsuits like this will just make it so much easier to get those highly qualified teachers to come on down and teach in Podunk. </p>
