			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Spencer S. Hsu, Washington Post, January 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Obama administration announced Friday evening that it will allow an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Haitians living in the United States illegally to stay and work in the country for 18 months as part of its response to Tuesday&rsquo;s earthquake. But officials warned Haitians that leaving their country now &#8220;will only bring more hardship to the Haitian people and nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said the decision to grant Temporary Protected Status  &mdash;  to illegal immigrants from Haiti who were living in the United States as of Jan. 12  &mdash;  was a gesture of compassion and an attempt to ensure that the immigrants can continue to send money to their devastated homeland.</p>

		<p>If anyone in the White Nationalist and American Renaissance community harbors any thought in their heads that these Haitians will ever be sent back to Haiti, then it is time for us to sit down and start negotiating on a bridge that I happen to own and wish to sell.</p>
<p>The objective, if I need to remind anybody - is the reduction of white people of European descent to a minority status - in their OWN native homelands.   That is the goal, and anything that can be leveraged (like this earthquake disaster) to speed that goal along, will be seized upon by our mortal enemies to accelerate the final climax of that goal.</p>
<p>Once again, people.  The question persists:  What are we going to do about this?   Genocide is a crime that is both well defined and it fits what is happening to whites in EVERY dominant White nation.   </p>
<p>News Flash:  This frozen, deer in the headlights expression that far too many of us have plastered on our faces - is not cutting the mustard.   </p>

<p>No it is not; it is simply the typical gesture of abysmal stupidity, that anyone with a brain has come to expect from this &ldquo;racially transcendent&rdquo; administration!</p>
<p>Frankly, I do not care in the least that Haiti has been &ldquo;devastated.&rdquo; In fact, I would see it as a fitting punishment to send these 100,000 to 200,000 Haitians (and if that is the federal &ldquo;estimate,&rdquo; it is probably closer to 500,000 to 1,000,000 of them)  back to this paradise of incompetence now that it is in a shambles, simply to emphasize their crime of breaking and entering into our country. </p>
<p>Enough said!</p>

		<p>I doubt anyone believes Obama providing refuge for his fellow &#8220;Blacks&#8221; will be &#8220;temporary&#8221;. Reportedly, there are only about 9 millions Haitians left who are not already here. Perhaps the best solution would for Obama to bring them all in. White expatriates, fleeing the violence, chaos and social disorder that is sure to follow could then colonize Haiti and establish  a White Republic. </p>

		<p>I care for the victims down there, I really do.  But I think it is in our best interest and theirs to spend whatever is necessary to rebuild Haiti or help them assimilate into neighboring islands such as Jamaica or Cuba.  Bringing them to the USA is obviously not going to make a lot of us happy, and we all know we would still have to pay as much for them being here as we would if we spent the money rebuilding their nation.  Seriously, I think this would be the most reasonable approach to stop the already out of control immigration in the USA.  Rebuilding or relocating Haitians to surrounding islands is well worth risking than the alternative of taking them all into Western nations.</p>

		<p>What people fail to understand is that words and phrases have different meanings depending on the context.  Cool can be &#8220;chilly&#8221; or &#8220;hip&#8221;.  Gay can mean &#8220;homosexual&#8221; or &#8220;cheerful&#8221;.  CD can mean &#8220;Certificate of Deposit&#8221; or &#8220;Compact Disc&#8221;.  This is very common in English.  Why people are surprised that temporary can mean either &#8220;briefly&#8221; or &#8220;permanent&#8221;.   I mean look at all the meanings &#8220;record&#8221; has, would the word &#8220;record&#8221; confuse anyone?</p>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t agree more with you Luke..I have asked this question on several forums and there is no satisfactory answer forthcoming.</p>
<p>You are correct in saying this is genocide and if Whites cannot/will not see that by now,( it is right in front of their faces) then something is terribly wrong in their thinking and false reality. I hate to say they are mentally unstable but what else can you call it? One would have to be, not to have a clue that this is all DELIBERATE, all happening at the same time and in ALL White nations at the same time&hellip;and they are that dense not to notice?  </p>

		<p>Part of me understands that it would lack compassion to return 200000 criminals to Haiti at this point in time in light of recent events. But they are still criminals. At the very least they should be retained in prison until a suitable time in the near future when it would be appropriate to deport them. It is wrong that our government is encouraging criminal activity   &mdash;   working without a valid work visa   &mdash;   in the name of the &#8220;relief effort&#8221;. It is no less justifiable than encouraging people to commit robbery or burglary in order to raise funds to send to Haiti.  They are still crimes, regardless of the ends to which the ill-gotten funds are put. </p>

		<p>If you look into the history of Haiti, the United Staes has been throwing incredible amounts of money at it since the 1950s. I&rsquo;m not kidding. Look into it!</p>
<p>At one point our ambassador presented Papa Doc with an aid check for millions of dollars, while the military band marched past and played a song in honor of the occasion&hellip;If the ambassador had spoken Haitian he would have realized the song was entitled, &#8220;We Hate White People&#8221;</p>
<p>Incredible, but true.</p>
<p>If that money had gone to the infrastructure and citizens rather than into the pockets of the ruling elite, Haiti could have easily been the most state of the art, richest society on the planet&hellip;.But that was never the agenda.</p>
<p>The agenda is unbeknownst to us, but well known to those in power who continue to milk the White American working man of every last penny they can squeeze out&hellip;.</p>
<p>And the saddest part of all is these men, the descendents of American Patriot Revolutionaries and The Pioneers sit back like the scared, lame brain, apathetic doofusses they are and simply let it happen.<br>

		<p>You should go to youtube and look at those comments.  So many bleeding hearts, and dont dare say anything negative because the word &#8220;hater&#8221;, along with obscenities comes out of the mouths of those bleeding hearts.  At the grocery store I overheard two women saying they wouldn&rsquo;t send a single cent!   Both older white ladies, here in bible belt North Carolina!  I agreed with them and told them I was tired of all the handouts this country gives out and the cashier said they come in and buy groceries with food stamps and then pull out $100.00 bills for the beer and wine.  When is this insanity going to end?  We need to vote every last incumbent out of office if we are going to try and do it by peaceful means.  We all know the alternative.</p>

<p>It frustrates me to talk to some white friends and acquaintances about these same topics we discuss here. Unless you start making yourself aware, like what we are doing here, whites really are naive. I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m alone in noticing this. I use to be naive myself. It just takes some longer than others to wake up. And even when whites do realize there being screwed, how do they react? Some flee, some fight. I&rsquo;m willing to fight and I know many here feel the same way. We need unity. I think most, if not all of the people who visit and agree with the forum of this website are decent people who are not motivated by hate for other races, just love for their own. Nobody owes me anything, but I don&rsquo;t owe anybody else anything either. I&rsquo;m tired of the government getting in my face and in my pockets and lecturing me and forcing me to pay for those who have no problem taking a free ride through life on my back. </p>

		<p>Luke and Anonymous (9:14 PM post) hit on issues that totally baffle me too.  I can&rsquo;t speak about other Western nations with any real certainty, however, here in Australia the materialistic nature of (what seems to be) an overwhelming majority of whites is one huge factor in them being apparently blind to the destruction of their own race.  They are too absorbed in obtaining the latest item of technology and &#8216;keeping up with the Joneses&rsquo; to notice the multitude of ethnic tribes roaming (and causing trouble) around our major cities (and now even some smaller regional cities).  Unfortunately, I believe Australians will not wake from their materialistic stupidity until their possessions are taken from them.  Then, they might come out fighting. </p>

		<p>These illegal Haitians don&rsquo;t care whether the feds allow them to stay and work or not.  The government has no control over these people so any edict they issue is nothing but empty words.  </p>
<p>If they wanted them gone they would be powerless to remove them, except for the ones who get caught committing crimes.  Once in custody, they can be turned over to ICE, but don&rsquo;t count on that.  They&rsquo;ll more than likely refuse to pick them up from the jurisdiction reporting they have them in custody.</p>
<p>There are allegedly 50,000 Irish immigrants in the US illegally.  Too bad we can&rsquo;t encourage about another 5 million more European immigrants to emigrate here so they can benefit from the amnesty that&rsquo;s sure to be coming.  It&rsquo;s a drop in the bucket compared to the brown skin hordes, but at least it would be something instead of the inundation we&rsquo;re getting criminals from the third world.</p>

<p>Harvesting the disasters.  Is this going to be a new ploy that will in time become a precedent?  From now on, every time Mexico has a volcanic tremor, or Jamaica has a hurricane, or Guatemala has a revolution, will they all be given &#8220;Protected Status&#8221; and authorized to remain?  Will additional tens of thousands be flown in, out of compassion?  Will we adopt all the orphans and take in all the injured and sick?  </p>
<p>Of course, we all know they will <i> never </i> go back again.  Since these disasters happen regularly   &mdash;   and will continue to happen   &mdash;   eventually the whole world will end up here!</p>
<p>Harvesting the disasters: How clever! Who would dare object? Is this a new weapon in the Diversitarians&rsquo; arsenal, in their unending campaign to dis-establish us and un-whiten the USA?  In their hatred for us, what will they think up next?</p>
<p>And naively working along with them, hand in hand, the maudlin religious groups will be eager to get right in there too and display their superior virtue, hopefully scoring some special credits with Heaven. All at the expense of the rest of us, needless to say.</p>
<p>And we are not fighting back; we are not resisting! Hardly anyone one dares say a word in protest.  At a time like this, when emotions rule, it is extremely difficult to speak out cooly and rationally on such a matter, or you will be met with the inevitable accusations of &#8220;racism&#8221;.   But, while we are not without compassion for the rest of the world, and we are willing to help, we must also have some concern for ourselves and for our own. Bringing the unfortunates HERE is not the same as helping them THERE.  Giving away your country is like a farmer giving away his farm. What will he have then?  What about his own posterity and their future? </p>
<p>Well, it occurs to me that perhaps a visit to the trendy yuppy districts of any urban center such as Boston or San Francisco or Washington would quickly explain this. Where are the children?  Young urban professionals and unmarried career women have dogs instead. As a result of the scary preaching 20-30 years ago about the population bomb and impending ecological disaster,  children (except imported foreign orphans) are very much out of fashion. Among whites, that is (non-whites were unaffected by the scare books and continued to reproduce as ever.)  For a country whose young (and middle-aged) white professionals now raise dogs instead of children, maybe it all fits together. Maybe it was designed to fit? </p>

<p>What I find equally frightening, besides the genocide of Whites in their homelands, is the usurpation and willful dismissal by the government of the Rule of Law. </p>
<p>Black Panthers brought weapons to a voting venue, threatened White voters using racial slurs and the Justice Department dismisses and ignores this clear violation of Federal Law claiming &#8216;proper&rsquo; punishment was meted out:  </p>
<p>&#8220;New Black Panther Party member who carried a nightstick barred from carrying weapons at polling places in the future!&#8221;</p>
<p>You can bet if the races were reversed, all hell would have broken loose.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Haitian (and other Third World) illegal colonists, in violation of Federal Immigration Laws, are ignored as well in the name of &#8216;compassion&rsquo; by the odious Director of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Our country was FOUNDED on the Rule of Law, which the government refuses to enforce, (especially if White are involved) and is rapidly sending the Bill of Rights and the American Constitution down the memory hole.  Whites have little to no redress in Courts of Law in the country they founded and are dismissed as a &#8216;hate group&rsquo; or called &#8216;homegrown terrorists&rsquo; by the government or put on &#8216;watch lists&rsquo; by the Department of Homeland Security (on advice from the $PLC and ADL).  </p>
<p>As we head into an era where there is No Rule Of Law (except what the government says it is), it will be Open Season on Whites and anarchy, mayhem, and untold violence are sure to follow, especially as the economy collapses and welfare entitlements dry up.</p>
<p>Get a good look at Haiti right now, this could be an American city after the collapse of the dollar.</p>
<p>On another side note:  You can bet Harry Reid is jumping for joy.</p>

		<p>Wouldnt now be an excellent time to send these illegal Haitians back?  They could be part of the US relief effort, 200,000 extra bodies to help clear rubble,and distribute aid.  Instead, thousands of Americans and Europeans will risk their lives trying to help people in a country that means nothing to them,and to which they owe nothing. And when they leave, the natives will resume machete-ing and barbecue-ing each other.  </p>

Loathsome leftie Naomi Klein invented the smear &#8220;Disaster Capitalism&#8221; to describe what she sees as the corporate exploitation of Third World natural disasters. What ghw describes above might be termed &#8220;Disaster Socialism&#8221;, by which the int&rsquo;l multicultists pounce upon every tremor in the Caribbean or tsunami in Southeast Asia or famine in Africa as an opportunity to rush the disaster victims to safety in the First World. (As other posters have pointed out, &#8220;Temporarily&#8221; in Bureaucratese translates as &#8220;Permanently&#8221;.)</p>
<p>And the general public throughout the First World is either oblivious to this backdoor immigration <i>from some of the worst places on earth</i>; or, in an act of suicidal altruism, endorses it. </p>

Exactly.  That is a good point.  <br>
It&rsquo;s nothing but a publicity gesture, meant  to look &#8220;compassionate&#8221;.  Giving these people permission to be in the country is nonsense.

<p>Obama&rsquo;s Haitian Aid: Amnesty - and more immigration?</p>
<p>Posted By Patrick Cleburne On 16 January 2010 @ 12:01 </p>
<p>True to the war-cry of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, the Obama administration is not letting the Haitian crisis go to waste. It has seized the opportunity to grant amnesty to the substantial quantity of illegal Haitian immigrants in this country, including those already caught and slated for deportation.</p>
<p>Technically, they have been granted Temporary Protected Status – TPS. As Juan Mann demonstrated for VDARE.com readers years ago, this program is essentially a fraud. As Mark Krikorian is quoted as saying in The Christian Science Monitor this evening:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;ve been able to determine, not a single person who has ever been granted this &lsquo;temporary&rsquo; status has later been deported.&rdquo;<br>

<p>Indeed they are!    Here is an article which is almost unbelievable. Not only are dewy-eyed American whites seeking to import Haitian orphans, but ones with AIDS seem to be especially preferred.  It&rsquo;s a way of demonstrating one&rsquo;s superior virtue, I suppose.  But the taxpayer will end up with the enormous bill. That means we all will pay for some unfulfilled person&rsquo;s craving to feel saintly.  Saintly  at our expense!<br>

<p>&#8220;Breems, whose agency has five families matched or waiting to travel, including a single mother who was supposed to leave this weekend to bring home her HIV-positive daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brett Schlenbaker and his wife, Kendra, of Bellingham, Wash., are in the process of adopting two children, an 8-year-old daughter, Dejennika, and her 6-year-old brother, Djouvensky. </p>
<p>&#8220;Tom DiFilipo, president of the Joint Council on International Children&rsquo;s Services, said his group would be setting up a Web-based registry through which families could try to get information about the Haitian children they hoped to adopt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lewen, 40, of Willowbrook, Ill., knows the two young sisters she is adopting are safe - for now.   The single parent-to-be started the adoption process in September and visited 1-year-old Sandina and 3-year-old Benciana in October.<br>
&#8220;I felt like the luckiest person in the world,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I got there on a Monday and Wednesday night I was so in love with them that I couldn&rsquo;t sleep.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Has there ever been a single case in recorded history where a White nation/state/city/town was severely impacted from a natural disaster, a deadly disease outbreak, or chronic starvation and the Whites had to be rescued or saved by intervention by a Black, Hispanic, or Muslim nation/state/city/town?</p>
<p>Furthermore, has a Black, Hispanic, or Muslim nation ever had the ability, knowledge, technical skills, and/or resources to offer assistance and solve complex problems to organize and facilitate such a rescue, independently?</p>
<p>If you are sane, you answered &#8220;no&#8221; and &#8220;no&#8221; to those two questions. </p>
<p>With that rational knowledge, one must further ask why the United States government wants to erase all White people and replace them with Blacks, Hispanics, and Muslims?</p>
<p>I suspect it is because Whites pose a threat to other Whites, and this is there way of mitigating a threat to the elite-White power structure. It is easier to control and pacify a dumbed-down group of mongrels.</p>
<p>I only hope I know their true motive before I die someday. I suspect multiple reasons.</p>

		<p>Given the severity of the earthquake for humanitarian reasons I would not object to this if it really was for 18 months.  But we all know that after the 18 months is up there will be an extension, and then another, and in fact they will <i>never</i> be sent home.</p>
<p>We know this because years ago there was an earthquake in Central America (I think it was El Salvador) and we took in a large number of &#8220;temporary&#8221; refugees.  They were never sent home.  What we got for our generosity was a large influx of MS-13 members. </p>

		<p>On the topic of Haitians getting TPS, Hilary Clinton said &ldquo;Well, we have, as you know, many Haitian Americans. Most are here legally. Some are not documented.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now they have legal status! TA DA! Stroke of the pen&hellip;ain&rsquo;t it great?  </p>
<p>Just divy out the &#8220;documents&#8221;&hellip; Amnesty by piecemeal.</p>
<p>Not to mention the millions more allowed in as they will sponsor their claimed &#8220;relatives&#8221; thru &#8220;family reunification&#8221; chain migration.</p>
<p><br>
Not to mention &#8220;The US government halted the deportation of non-criminal Haitians living in the US nearly a year ago and is not currently deporting illegal Haitian immigrants in the aftermath of this week&rsquo;s earthquake.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://www.alternet.org/rss/breaking_news/102734/shield_urged_for_thousands_of_haitian_immigrants_in_us/</p>
<p>Where the hell is my &#8220;shield&#8221; from all these TPS recipients and their advocates?</p>
<p><br>
Napolitano ADMITS there are as many as 200,000 illegal alien Haitians in the US. And now they all get to stay. I say cancel the diversity lottery entirely until the temporary protected status of all TPS groups  &mdash;  Haitians, Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, Hondurans, Somalis, Sudanese  &mdash;  has been resolved, that is, until they are no longer protected and have to go home. Why is every natural disaster in the world our responsibility?</p>
<p><br>
The presence of an illegal in America unchallenged IS already a de-facto temporary citizenship. </p>
<p>This is quietly going to become an open-door policy for Haitians, who are just about the most ignorant, hysterical and easily manipulated Marxist-leaning people in this hemisphere and will make great Dem voters. </p>
<p>The Dominican Republic, which shares the same island with Haiti, is fighting hard against letting them in because Dominicans realize that Haitians are nuts and will be nothing but a destabilizing force.</p>

		<p>Disaster harvesting has been going on in the USA for at least 50 years. Virtually every time America gets involved in a Third World nation, it results in massive immigration   &mdash;   Korea, Viet Nam, Cuba, Panama, Kosovo, Iran, Palestine, Somalia, Iran, Iraq, Kurdistan, etc., etc.  I shudder every time we invade or send &#8220;peace-keepers&#8221; to any foreign country, because I know that within 6 months the planes and boats will be disgorging tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of immigrant refugees.   </p>

		<p>For years our government has told us that not only were diversity and immigration keys to our  economic growth, but absolutely essential for economic and national viability.  I can now understand why Haiti has been mired in poverty for 200 years – low diversity and high emigration out of Haiti!</p>
<p>If we love Haiti and truly want to help those people, we must increase both their diversity and population immediately.  Did you know that there are virtually no Arabs, Bangladeshi or Tibetans living in Haiti?   I strongly recommend that we not only return to Haiti all Haitians currently residing in America, but that we also aid their diversity by henceforth sending all Mexican, Arab, Somalian, Albanians, etc., etc., immigrants from America to Haiti.  </p>
<p>Yes, it may reduce our diversity and economic growth.  But during this crisis, we need to think of others for a change.  <br>

		<p>You know what I dont understand.  Here in South Africa, and elsewhere, it is fashionable to knock America.  I doesnt matter who you ask, they will say America this, America that, all derogatory statements.  It is just so &#8220;in&#8221; to knock America, on TV, newspapers etc.<br>
But I ask you with tears in my eyes, please show me another country in the world, any country, that comes close to America in times like these.  Kudos to the UK and other western countries, but honestly, the US sets the bar.  If there is a problem, disaster etc anywhere in the world, they are there.<br>
And where may I ask, are the rich Arab nations in this?<br>

<p>The person that wrote this is obviously overlooking the clear strengths of a multi-cultural society.  Black societies excel, not in organizing relief efforts, but rather in providing the needed critical review feedback to identify the weaknesses and failures of the white dissaster response effort.  Furthermore, blacks excel not in cleaning up rubble and reorganizing destroyed areas, but in marching in the streets, singing, and otherwise providing a festive environment that is conducive towards attracting positive media reporting as to the bravery and resilliance of these noble people.</p>

<p><b>Julie  asks:   &#8220;How can we get the immigration bureaucracy out of the hands of the Democrats? &#8220;</b><br>
It&rsquo;s not just the Democrats. It goes way beyond that.  Make no mistake  (as SL Cain already pointed out above),   if McCain had won and the Repubs were in control  (as when Bush was in control), US immigration policy would still be essentially the same.  Invade the world, invite the world.   </p>
<p>Those in control play both parties. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by inter-party bickering.  You&rsquo;re given the impression of a choice.  It&rsquo;s like asking you if you prefer your KoolAid flavored either raspberry or strawberry.  Don&rsquo;t swallow either one!</p>
<p><b>S.L.Cain says:  &#8220;Our immigration policy was not made by us, and it does not work for us.  It is a transparent fraud.&#8221; </b></p>
<p>So true!   Ever since that misleading Emma Lazarus poem was tacked onto the Statue of Liberty, inviting the &#8220;huddled masses&#8221; and  &#8220;wretched refuse&#8221; of the world&rsquo;s &#8220;teeming shores&#8221;  to all come here, we have lost control of our immigration policy&hellip; and of our country.   </p>
<p>This situation has been long in the making.  (The poem was added to the statue in 1903, 16 yrs. after Lazarus&rsquo; death, and  20 years  <i>after </i> the statue was given to the US, commemorating American independence in 1783.)  That deceptive poem completely transformed the oiginal meaning of the statue from being a monument to liberty and independence  into a monument to immigration.  So it has been ever since.<br>

		<p>To KevinSA (re post # 37):</p>
<p>Kevin, you say &#8220;here in South Africa and elsewhere, it is fashionable to knock America&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>KevinSA, who in the new South Africa is knocking America, exactly? Is it the ANC, the press, liberal whites like Nadine Gordimer and Helen Suzman, the Afrikaner population, or someone else? If it is the ANC, don&rsquo;t they realize they owe their ascendancy to power to American support?</p>
<p>I too, note that no Muslim nation has offered even a scintilla of support. I believe that&rsquo;s because many Haitians practice and believe in voodoo, which, to a Muslim is akin to the work of the devil. Most Haitians are Catholic, which also does not find much favor in the Islamic world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said this on other sites, so I&rsquo;ll say it here: I believe that earthquakes are by far, the best ways of bringing the peoples of the world together; certainly more so than the Olympics, rock music or global warming symposiums. Differences tend to be put aside to tend to the matter at hand.</p>
<p>Your last couple of sentences were telling. The Lord does work in mysterious ways, and New Orleans - which also has a large voodoo-worshipping population - and Haiti could have been targeted because of their people&rsquo;s beliefs. Hey, Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by fire, due to the evil people therein, so who&rsquo;s to say that New Orleans and Haiti weren&rsquo;t socked for a similar reason?</p>
<p>And how did many Haitians respond? By looting and setting up road blocks.</p>
<p>I note that some news reports say that up to 200,000 Haitians were killed in the quake. That&rsquo;s a high, raw number, but it&rsquo;s less than 3% of Haiti&rsquo;s population of 9 million. </p>
