<h1>State Department Using &#8216;Diversity Visas&rsquo; to Encourage Immigration to U.S. from Terror-Ridden Yemen</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matt Cover, Cybercast News Service, January 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The State Department has awarded 1,011 special &#8220;diversity visas&#8221; allowing Yemeni nationals to immigrate to the United States since 2000, the year 17 U.S. sailors were killed when the USS Cole was attacked by terrorists in the Yemeni port of Aden.</p>
<p>The &#8220;diversity visas&#8221; are designed to encourage immigration from countries that do not otherwise send significant numbers of immigrants to the United States.</p>
<p>The State Department roster of all countries whose nationals have received &#8220;diversity visas&#8221; to immigrate to the United States in 2010, for example, shows that 2 of these immigrants will be from Luxembourg, 3 from the Solomon Islands, 4 from French Guiana,  5 from Reunion, 6 from Cape Verde, 7 from Malta, 8 from Guinea-Bissau, 9 from Comoros, 10 from Suriname  &mdash;  and 72 from Yemen.  Nationals of the four states listed by the State Department as state sponsors of terrorism  &mdash;  Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria  &mdash;  also received &#8220;diversity visas&#8221; from the State Department to immigrate to the United States in 2010.  These include 98 from Syria, 298 from Cuba, 1,084 from Sudan, and 2,773 from Iran.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The State Department&rsquo;s Diversity Visa Program was created by a provision in an immigration bill signed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990. The first diversity visas were granted under the program in 1995. The purpose of the program is to expand immigration to the United States from countries that do not typically sending large numbers of immigrants here.  Under the program, to be eligible for a diversity visa a prospective immigrant must be a citizen of a country that has sent less than 50,000 immigrants to the United States during the preceding five-year period. This critieria effectively leaves nationals from the vast majority of nations eligible to receive diversity visas.</p>
<p>Currently, the only countries excluded from the program are: Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, South Korea, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Approximately 50,000 diversity visas are distributed each year by lottery to applicants who sign up with the State Department during an annual registration period. The applicants must have a high school education or at least two years of work experience in certain jobs. Applicants can fill out the lottery registration forms themselves or have a lawyer or private organization do it for them.</p>
<p>Winning applicants are selected at random by computer and sent a notification letter. They are given an interview date at the U.S. embassy or consulate in their country, and, if they pass the interview, are allowed to enter the United States as legal permanent residents.</p>

<p>Many are the times that I ask myself, what will future generations of whites, if there are any of us left, have to say about the current 75 years of our history? Will it be that we were simply soft hearted fools; or that we were bizarrely self-destructively arrogant abominations, who had no concept of, or empathy for, a future?</p>
<p>In my heart of hearts, I know it must and will be the latter charge!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diversity visas,&rdquo; indeed; it sounds like something concocted in a particularly surreal Far Side comic strip or Simpsons&rsquo; episode.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!<br>

		<p>Empire America seems to be doing exactly the right thing to guarantee its demise.</p>
<p>What better why is there, short of overwhelming military action, to destroy a nation by importing its enemies, and those who offer nothing, but come here in order to be cared for? </p>
<p>Diversity is not only dumb, it is a very decided weakness.</p>

		<p>Yorkshire is a county in England which is part of Britain which, in, turn forms part of Great Britain (&#8216;Great&rsquo; is a political-geographical term) and the whole is the United Kingdom. I&rsquo;ve just discovered I&rsquo;m not diverse enough to qualify! Oh golly gosh!!<br>

<p>If a bleeping liberal tries telling you his line &#8220;all people, all races are the same&#8221;, tell him where to get off. The liberal dogma pushed at Whites from every direction is slowly but surely destroying our race and culture, thanks to self-hating White liberal crackpots.</p>

		<p>What exactly is the idea behind this? How about a new idea? Let&rsquo;s have a 10-year moratorium on ALL people coming her, legal, illegal, the alphabet of visa workers, refugess, just anyone who wants to come. Take this time to assimilate the last groups who&rsquo;ve come legally. Many seem to think they don&rsquo;t need to honor the oath of citizenship by wanting to keep their own languages and refusing to assimilate at all - except to learn the way to the &#8220;giveaway&#8221; offices. Then, sharply reduce the numbers coming and accept only those who will add to our nation, not unskilled, uneducated people who will be a burden on this country. And, please! I&rsquo;m so sick of hearing this is a nation of immigrants. I&rsquo;ll wager most people reading this are native-born. My family came in 1699. All nations were once made up of people who came from elsewhere, but they conviently forget that we now have LAWS against just walking in. Let&rsquo;s remind our government of that too.</p>

		<p>Nothing, but nothing gives me a bigger laugh, than that hackneyed &#8220;America is a melting pot.&#8221; Because invariably, ethnic or racial groups prefer to live amongst their own type. That is, until it&rsquo;s time to &#8220;integrate&#8221; another White (previously low-crime White neighborhood). Then Blacks and Latinos move in, and the crime rate starts climbing.</p>
<p>Even churches are heavily segregated along racial lines. Something liberal fools bemoan to no end. You bring Muslims(including Africans) here, they tend to group with other Muslims. Latinos tend to stubbornly see themselves as Mexicans as opposed to assimilating into our culture. What in the name of hell is WRONG with liberal fools. That they can neither see, understand nor admit that multi-cultural diversity is and always will be but an utter fraud!</p>

		<p>The diversity lottery system was another one of Ted Kennedy&rsquo;s immigration reform measures.  Can anyone see if these wonderful Yemini immigrants could be resettled in Hyannis Massachusetts? <br>
I&rsquo;m sure the white liberals in town will be delighted with having their community &#8216;enriched&rsquo; by these folks. </p>

		<p>The liberals in charge do not care about regular middle class white Americans. They encourage the dregs of all societies to come to America, as long as they vote democrat. These liberals live in all white gated communities and are out of touch with normal (white middle class) citizens. The sad part is these new Americans are being used by the ones in power to retain their power and are not assimilating to American society.They expect normal citizens to just embrace diversity and continue paying everyone&rsquo;s way, while we are buckling under the pressure. The only solution..vote out all the liberals!</p>

		<p>The Diversity Visa Lottery program allows up to 50,000 persons from &#8220;underrepresented&#8221; nations into this country each year.  Typically, in a given year the State Department sifts through millions of applications.  Created as part of the 1990 immigration reform package, it is a major reason for the changing racial composition of the U.S.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a big surprise:  Senator Ted Kennedy was the driving force behind the legislation.  Even in death, he&rsquo;s the gift that keeps on giving.       </p>

		<p>Encouraging immigration from Yemen - when the Big O [reluctantly] announces that Yemen is one of the countries which suddenly is suspicious enough and dangerous enough to require more extensive body searches of airline passengers from there? After one immigrant from the Middle East, nonsensically allowed in our own military, blows up an Air Force Base on American soil, immigration from there is still ENCOURAGED? It shows you the train wreck that is America.</p>
