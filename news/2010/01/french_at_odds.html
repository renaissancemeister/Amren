<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-europe/20100106/EU.France.Elite.Schools/">French at Odds Over Putting Poor Into Top Schools</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Angela Charlton, Comcast News, January 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Government ministers, intellectuals and activists clashed this week over whether to set quotas to ensure more low-income students can attend a handful of &#8220;grandes ecoles,&#8221; university-level institutions seen as the country&rsquo;s premier path to prosperity and power.</p>
<p>The government, pressed to ease social tensions and persistent class divides in a country whose motto includes the word &#8220;equality,&#8221; proposed that the schools give 30 percent of spots to students on financial aid.</p>
<p>The body that oversees the publicly funded schools, the Conference des grandes ecoles, shot the plan down. Quotas, they said, would dumb the system down, threatening its whole raison d&rsquo;etre by crippling the competitiveness of top French schools and their graduates in the international marketplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think we could improve the level of our world champion handball team if we required that there were a certain percentage of people with a particular characteristic? The answer is no, of course,&#8221; wrote the conference&rsquo;s president, Pierre Tapie.</p>
<p>Education Minister Luc Chatel said he was &#8220;shocked&#8221; by the schools&rsquo; rejection of quotas and said he was determined to see the measure through. He said the current system &#8220;produces only social inequality.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 6 percent of post-secondary students go to France&rsquo;s 220 grandes ecoles, which include the HEC business school and the Ecole Polytechnique engineering school. The system was born in 1747 to train top engineers, and today access is meant to be based purely on merit.</p>
<p>Yet passing the demanding entrance exams require years of preparation and knowledge of the French education system that students from working class or immigrant families often lack.</p>
<p>At the grandes ecoles, the student body is &#8220;very, very white&#8221; and many students already know each other before they are admitted, said Arnaud Riegert, who tutors high school students from disadvantaged neighborhoods. His pupils include white, Arab and black youth from around the country trying to get into top universities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But he says quotas are not the answer. He says the tough exams and admission process are the biggest problem, and that the grandes ecoles should reach out beyond the handful of prep schools that traditionally provide most recruits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>President Nicolas Sarkozy, who did not attend a &#8220;grande ecole&#8221; himself and is the son of a Hungarian immigrant, has encouraged more diversity in top political levels.</p>
<p>But quotas make many in France bristle.</p>
<p>The FIDL, a federation of high school student unions, said Wednesday that quotas would &#8220;cast suspicion on graduates of the top schools who come from poor neighborhoods, as soon as one could imagine that they were recruited because of their social origin and not their abilities.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I attended the Ecole Polytechnique in 1980. Yes, I am a graduate of the &#8220;X&#8221;! This is very prestigious, but I was called back to my native Natal to  be a sangoma (shaman).</p>
<p>I will give you my impressions of what is happening in La France, and, by extension, America. You are giving up all  excellence. Why? Why would anyone give up excellence? Because you don&rsquo;t believe that it really exists, just as you don&rsquo;t really believe that the spirit world exists. I see a relationship between the two of these.</p>
<p>That relationship is this:  the hierarchy. There is a hierarchy of spirits. If you give that up, you do not see the hierarch of humans. This is not based on race; it is based on excellence. If it so happens that blacks do not achieve excellence in the academic, or whites do not achieve excellence in the ball sport, then so be it. But it is not that easy. Many whites are excellent at the ball sport, and many blacks are good at the academic. </p>
<p>Let us all reach for excellence, and trust God (Mkumbe-mumbe) for the results. If a person does not achieve excellence in one area, God will leads him to another. If a person cannot achieve excellence at all, God will give him  the other gifts, such as empathy, or psychic abilities.</p>
<p>As a sunusi (lore-master) of the Zulu people, I can assure you that the Zulu cherish their identity, and do not want to be European, or go where they are not to be wanted.</p>
<p>So the European must let us be what we are. We would like the European to be what he is and not encroach upon us with monkey<br>
talk about love and helping us.</p>
<p>Why do you want our love so much? This is not manlike.</p>

		<p>First Neocon Nick Sarkozy brings affirmative action to France, now quotas and busing.</p>
<p>AFAIK France&rsquo;s previous Socialist premiers never pushed this garbage but a &#8220;conservative&#8221; supports it. </p>

		<p>&#8216;quotas would &ldquo;cast suspicion on graduates of the top schools who come from poor neighborhoods, as soon as one could imagine that they were recruited because of their social origin and not their abilities.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t he mean quotas would cast suspicion on people of color? After all, &#8216;positive action&rsquo; was never granted to the proletariat, even after blood spilled in the French Revolution and after Centuries of serfdom. But it&rsquo;s to the front of the line for the interlopers. Just who is it the aristocrats are really concerned with keeping down? <br>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be fooled into believing that the obvious outcome of this is anything but inevitable. At some point, the usage of such euphemisms as &ldquo;reaching beyond&rdquo; and &#8220;reaching out to disadvantaged communities&#8221; (translation: dumbing things down to their level to sustain the illusion that they can compete) will just tug at the heartstrings of the general public and inspire future public demonstrations in favor of inclusiveness. I applaud the French, however, for at least demonstrating some level of common sense regarding the outcome of quota systems. </p>
<p><br><br>Quotation from article:<br><i><br>
&ldquo;Do you think we could improve the level of our world champion handball team if we required that there were a certain percentage of people with a particular characteristic? The answer is no, of course,&rdquo; wrote the conference&rsquo;s president, Pierre Tapie.</i><br><br></p>
<p>This is reminiscent of one of Jared Taylor&rsquo;s older articles, emphasizing the difference between functional diversity and non-functional diversity. Tapie is naïve, however, if he genuinely thinks that diversity proponents truly believe their own hogwash about the benefits of diversity. That belief may be what diversity proponents use to justify discrimination in their own minds, of course. What Tapie fails to realize is that diversity initiatives are not truly based on the premise that diversity is an improvement to the institutions which foster it. They&rsquo;re actually based on the prospect of enabling more minority presence, regardless of the qualifications of the minority beneficiaries. It is dubiously claimed that diversity, in and of itself, is a necessary trait for competency in an increasingly diverse market/culture. In other words, Affirmative Action proponents attempt to persuade their critics (which, in some cases, are institutions that are skeptical about diversity initiatives) that they, themselves, are the true beneficiaries of diversity. That is just a transparent incentive to embrace their self-serving diversity doctrine. This is as humorous and transparent as when a job-seeker says at an interview, &#8220;Actually, I&rsquo;m seeking this position because I believe I can be a great asset to this company&#8221;&hellip;<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m an American in Europe, and the euros love to lecture me on our race problems: <br>
why have we made so little progress in the US???? </p>
<p>then I tell them about race quotas &amp; disparate impact. </p>
<p>Then their mouths drop open: &#8220;We would never accept such madness here!&#8221; </p>

		<p>Even if they were selected for their abilities, the non-White and even the poor would bring down standards because of the way poverty effects ethics, even with whites.  Unfortunately, there is some sense to the idea that an elite is required to maintain a society.  It is when that elite looses its own sense of priorities that the order is again harmed.  Since we are humans, these things always come up again and again.  But nothing guarantees a quick decline like actually planting people from desperate and alien groups into your upper echalons.  If people rise, it is best for that rise to occur over several generations rather than overnight, as is so common in America.  We are expert in turning the world upside-down.  The really terrible thing is that other Western nations have seemed to copy our mistakes because it makes them feel righteous and makes fpr appealing press in the short term.</p>
