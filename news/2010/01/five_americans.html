<h1><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6030UM20100104">Five Americans Say No Plan to Attack Inside Pakistan</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kamran Haider, Reuters, January 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Five Americans suspected of using the Internet to contact militant groups to carry out terrorist attacks told a Pakistani court on Monday they had only wanted to give fellow Muslims financial and medical aid.</p>
<p>The students, in their 20s and from the U.S. state of Virginia, were detained last month. Police officials said emails showed they had contacted the Taliban, and that the group had planned to use them for attacks in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The suspects appeared at an anti-terrorism court and were remanded until January 18, said defense lawyer Mohammad Amir Khan.</p>
<p>&#8220;The five men denied having been in contact with al Qaeda, Jaish-e-Mohammad (a Pakistani militant group) or any other militant group,&#8221; he told Reuters after the hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;They told the court they wanted to go to Afghanistan to help their Muslim brothers, like those needing medical or financial assistance, and had no plans to carry out any activity in Pakistan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police told the court the five men were in contact with an al Qaeda operative identified as Saifullah, Khan told Reuters. Police have said they would seek a life sentence for the men.</p>
<p>&#8220;They had deep interest in the religion and they were of the opinion that a Jihad must be waged against the infidels for the atrocities committed by them against Muslims around the world,&#8221; said a police interrogation report last month.</p>

		<p>Possible terrorists telling lies, impossible.  At least in a Pakistani court they have a chance of being convicted, here in the states they could just pull the racism card and get out of trouble.  Hopefully all five rot to death in Pakistan.</p>

		<p>These young men were doing EXACTLY what we would expect them to do.  They are Muslims and they love their people and their ancestral countries.  It is their duty to fight back against those who are killing Muslims.  </p>
<p>We are the same as they: we would expect American men to defend America.  Why would Obama think that these Muslims would not defend their home, their people, their nation, and their religion?  </p>
<p>Obama and his fellow travelers actually think that the moment a foreigner steps off of the plane and onto American soil that they suddenly no longer have any allegiance to their family or religion, back in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan or Yemen.  Yet, 9-11 and dozens of other examples show us that these &#8220;Muslim patriots&#8221; are very willing to fight, and if necessary, die for their people and religion.     </p>
<p>This is why it is insanity to keep importing (via immigration and student visas) hundreds of thousands of Muslims.  Folks, these people hate us and want to do us harm.  We have killed their brothers and sisters, sons and daughters   &mdash;   we have invaded thier lands, and they want revenge.  STOP IMPORTING MUSLIMS!  STOP IMPORTING TERRORISM! There is no benefit to bringing millions of Muslims into the USA. </p>

<p>Just looking at the photo, demonstrates that this an Oreo Cookie operation of sorts; that white idiot amongst the four blacks, is doubtlessly as Red as a rotting tomato in the July sun. He was also probably, the &ldquo;brains&rdquo; in this fools&rsquo; errand of terrorism.</p>
<p>I hope this collection of  Muslim and Communist &ldquo;revolutionaries&rdquo; are executed, and given Pakistani &ldquo;sensibilities&rdquo; on this issue, they will likely wish they had been if they are not!</p>

		<p>This is why we will have another 9/11, if not from jets; our government insists on importing populations from cultures that clash completely with the West.  Yet, our leaders our stubborn, they refuse to accept the obvious.  They are out to prove that they can form the international multicultural state and it will work.  It didn&rsquo;t work for Rome, and it did not work for any of the empires that attempted to mimick it.  The amazing thing to me is at the speed of the turnover of history.  </p>
<p>Saying &#8220;Yes, we can.&#8221; in the face of blantant proof of the contrary is nothing but tragically arrogant.</p>

		<p>Now these SOBs are going to experience sharia law firsthand. I&rsquo;d like to see them sentenced to life imprisonment, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the Obama regime cuts some sort of deal with Pakistan to have them sent to the USA; in exchange for more military aid to Pakistan.</p>

<p>I agree with your entire post with the exception that &#8220;we&#8221; are killing Muslims.  To my way of thinking &#8220;we&#8221; are as much victims of US policy as Muslims in other countries.</p>
<p>This government is not only dysfunctional and represents a  deteriorating empire it is dangerous to those of us who oppose them and their policies.</p>
<p>Remember!  They killed dozens of us in Waco and Ruby Ridge as easily as they&rsquo;re killing Muslims right now, and they would have continued with their heavy-handed tactics had not the militias risen up and threatened to fight back.  Government bureaucrats  are now embarking on the same overbearing course the were on in the mid nineties.</p>

		<p>  With so much turmoil in Pakistan and so many unassimilated Pakistani immigrants in the United States, what do you think the likely result will be?  Would the United States Govenment be willing to cut back on immigration from these troubled areas? There&rsquo;s more chance of finding Blackbeard&rsquo;s treasure in Kansas.  </p>

		<p>This notion apparently escapes a lot of people, but there is much more to being an American than legally being a citizen. </p>
<p>Waqar Hussain Khan, Ramy Zamzam, Umar Farooq, Ahmed Abdulah Minni, and Aman Hassan Yemer are sure proof of that. </p>

		<p>Several things are equally certain: 1. These clowns had every intention of carrying out attacks in Pakistan - or worse - India, which if damaging enough could provoke a nuclear exchange between the two countries; they could have sent money and medical supplies from the Virginia without actually having to travel any further than a local bank, a local Walgreens, and a local FedEx.  Note: sending money and medical supplies to Al Qaida from Virginia would have violated US laws prohibiting providing &#8220;material support&#8221; to terrorist groups.  2. Whining the various buzzwords the US left has taught them, like &#8220;hard childhoods&#8221;, &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;lack of opportunity&#8221; will not avail them one iota in a court in Pakistan, where the government there is fighting literally for its own survival.  3. They&rsquo;re going to get convicted.</p>
<p>A recent Scientific American article covered a possible nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan involving 50 weapons on each side.  The expected result is 20 million people killed in the immediate exchange, plus an additional 100 million deaths from the famine that would result after 5 million tons of smoke and dust created by the explosions was blown into the atmosphere, cooling temperatures and reducing crop yields (this is exactly what happened after the explosion of Tambora volcano in 1815).<br>
As tense as the old Cold War was at times, there were some mitigating factors which doubtless helped prevent actual US-Soviet conflict: The US and USSR had never gone to war before,  Americans and Russians harbor no ethnic or religious hatred for each other, and neither country occupied territory claimed by the other.  Unfortunately, none of these apply to the India/Pakistan situation.  By involving themselves in conflict in the part of the world where such conflict is more likely than anywhere else to go nuclear, these five goofball criminals were doing anything but &#8220;helping their Muslim brothers&#8221;.  What they were doing was more akin to pumping gasoline onto a housefire.</p>

<p>Another dissimilarity between USA-USSR and Pakistan-India nuclear conflict is that both the Americans and Russians were intelligent white people who grokked MAD.  I can&rsquo;t say the same for either the Pakistanis or Indians.</p>
