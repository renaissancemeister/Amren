			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henrik Holappa, Google Groups, January 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Finnish Department of Justice is planning on suppressing the freedom of speech in Finland  &mdash;  now even more. The special legal group of the Department of Justice is now planning the new blueprints of the law that would especially focus on so called &#8220;Internet Racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>The major newspaper in Finland, Helsingin Sanomat, reported of the suggested plan on their websites <b>here.</b> </p>
<p>According to the new law suggestion, just clicking yourself on the alleged &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; website (whether it is David Duke&rsquo;s, the Resistance Movement&rsquo;s websites or any other prominent white&rsquo;s civil rights movement&rsquo;s website) that would be enough to sentence a Finnish citizen to 4 years in prison. I emphasize  &mdash;  just visiting a racist website would be enough to sentence someone to 4 years in prison.</p>
<p>According to the Department of Justice  &mdash;  this new law would tremendously prevent racism in Finland, as it was mentioned, especially on Internet.</p>
<p>Probably one reason behind the new law suggestion leads to the shooting rampage in Espoo, a city near Helsinki, that took place on the New Year&rsquo;s eve. The suspected shooter, Ibrahim Shkupolli,  &mdash;  originated from Kosovo, shot 4 at the shopping mall and later on that day Shkupolli shot himself. Before the shooting took place at the shopping mall, he had shot his former Finnish girlfriend. The event stimulated among the Finnish citizens the discussion about the uncontrolled mass-immigration, which the Finnish government considered racist.</p>
<p>The special legal group of the Finnish government&rsquo;s Department of Justice would like to add a new paragraph to the law in their struggle against the racism. The law would carry a name of &#8220;Aggravated incitement for Racial Hatred&#8221;, and the maximum sentence of the crime would be 4 years in prison. The law could be used in various cases  &mdash;  as an additional charge  &mdash;  such as; &#8220;incitement for mass-destruction&#8221; and for a slaying made on a terrorist purpose.</p>
<p>One can only guess what &#8220;incitement for mass-destruction&#8221; may really mean. In Spain, for example, just denying the Holocaust  &mdash;  or simply questioning it  &mdash;  it is considered as &#8220;incitement for mass-destruction.&#8221; The Holocaust denial law does not exist in Finland, but several other existing anti-racist laws could be used in a way that an individual could be sentenced of an alleged Holocaust denial.</p>
<p>The current law of incitement for racial hatred allows a person to be sentenced to maximum of 2 years in prison. Of course the government and the legal system may use both legal paragraphs  &mdash;  incitement for racial hatred and aggravated incitement for racial hatred  &mdash;  to sentence an individual to a maximum sentence of 6 years in prison, including using several other legal paragraphs  &mdash;  such as violation of freedom of speech and in some cases even aggravated defamation  &mdash;  combined together in one sentence.</p>
<p>However, if the law is being executed as such, it would literally mean the following; an individual visits on a racist website and leaves a comment on the discussion board  &mdash;  he has already committed two serious crimes; incitement for racial hatred and possibly violation of freedom of speech.</p>
<p>However, always when a foreigner is being a victim of any crime, the police investigation leaves from the allegation it was racially motivated crime. This explains the statistical growth of the racist crimes in Finland, but it does not prove that all crimes in which a foreign individual has been a victim of a crime would have been committed on a racist purpose.</p>
<p>The new law would also make it possible to punish certain groups of individuals that may share a common racialist view, whether they share it publicly or in different discussion forums on Internet. If the law would be taken in use in that way, it may possibly mean the arrests and convictions of hundreds or even thousands of Finns in the near future.</p>
<p>The Freedom of Speech in Finland would be tremendously restricted, just in a next few months. This would force the Finnish nationals to be silent about the harms of the multicultural society. That what will be the new definition of racism, may only be guessed, but the every-day racism, violence and even deaths committed against the Finns will not probably be recognized by the new law exchange.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading through Mark Steyn&rsquo;s book, America Alone. This latest travesty from Finland exemplifies the trend he outlines: a decadent, shrinking, aging secular European playboy culture intent on destroying itself, and being forced in the process to come to terms with a growing, intolerant and increasingly aggressive Islamic invasion which is capitalizing on Europe&rsquo;s dumb mistakes over the past century.</p>
<p>In my opinion, European civilization reached its zenith around 1910 and has been in a state of massive decline and retreat ever since. One of the features of that erstwhile civilization was the ability to engage in some modicum of free expression, discussion and exchange. It looks like another light is going out in Europe, and I seriously doubt that it will ever be lit again, whether in our lifetimes or those of anyone else. The radical Islamic state that will be built on Europe&rsquo;s ruins will be even less tolerant than what obtains now.</p>
<p>America alone? Looks like it to me.</p>

<p>We should arrange free transportation for any Haitians wishing to emigrate to Finland.</p>
<p>The Finns are now powerless to object, under pain prosecution and imprisonment by their own government.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s damned decent of their government to take the lead in this stellar humanitarian gesture.  Our hats should be off to them.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m in the minority, but the way I see it, free speech is not the problem. What is designated as &#8216;restricted speech&rsquo; and hate speech is the problem. It wouldn&rsquo;t bother me to restrict the speech and indeed the very existence of non-white racial interest groups, and indeed their mention in our schools, media and government. It&rsquo;s time non-whites got the &#8216;racist nazi&rsquo; treatment, and whites be allowed to advance whatever cockamamy ideas they may have. Call it, making up for past injustice. And lets be angry about it.  </p>

		<p>The racial situation in America is much, much worse than in any country in Europe.  Mark Steyn is a neocon who couldn&rsquo;t care less if Europe became 100% black, as long as the blacks weren&rsquo;t Muslim.  Radical Islam is not the real problem, non-whites living in white societies is the real problem.  </p>

<p>Reminds me of a group that petitioned to keep Jared Taylor from speaking on campus. A university in Florida I believe, one where there are endless non-white special interest groups on campus, in an act basically denying Jared Taylor freedom of speech. Their reasoning? If the speech were held it would be possible at some future date that someone&rsquo;s freedom of speech might be infringed upon. They kind of ignored the fact, too, that everything Taylor has said on the subject has been in favor of free speech, and Mr Taylor it&rsquo;s major champion. </p>

		<p>I wonder just how many people who are so ready to flush Europe down the toilet have actually been there?  Lived there?  Been outside a major city there? </p>
<p>Having traveled extensively throughout large portions of continental Europe all I can say is the East Coast of America is visible more diverse than most of the Europe I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>I must say that I haven&rsquo;t seen France or Britain, but I just wonder what some people are talking about when they talk about Europe?  Just guesses made from statistics?  Certainly the big cities have visible minority groups, but the surrounding towns are not diverse.  I wish I could say the same for where I live.</p>
<p>I mean whole portions of the south are over %50 black.  It doesn&rsquo;t get much more diverse than that&hellip;  </p>
<p>The people who make such statements must be living in a trailer on a mountain in Idaho. I wish the America I encounter everyday was as monocultural as many places I&rsquo;ve lived in in Europe. </p>

		<p>A daring and anarchic way to subvert such a draconian law, would to organize a protest where on a certain day hundreds of Finnish patriots would log on and visit every racialist website and forum. Maybe leave a generic &#8216;Greetings from Finland!&rsquo;. The authorities could then chase themselves trying to hunt down and prosecute everyone that clicked on a site. The courts would be tied up for months at least. Also no one pay any fines. Demand jail time! </p>

		<p>Reading this sort of thing is so upsetting, it almost makes me physically ill. I worry for Europe.  </p>
<p>Like Anonymous #3, I too completely agree with &#8220;Liberate Europe&#8221;(#1).  However, I take exception to the idea about America standing alone.  We are all inextricably intertwined, and we are ALL sliding down the same slippery slope together. (Or being led down it!)  In fact, the similarity in the predicaments facing ALL the white countries today, around the world, is extraordinarily similar, and it is absolutely astounding to observe.  It simply CAN&rsquo;T be a mere coincidence.</p>
<p>As SKIP said,  what you see in the area  around Paris&rsquo; DeGaulle airport are largely Africans, whether they are Moslems or not. In truth, many of the nominal &#8220;Moslems&#8221; living in France today are non-religious and are non-practicing. They eat pork and drink wine.  But being less Moslem does not make them more white. It will never make them more French (nor more European).</p>
<p>And, like ATBOTYL, I also agree about America&rsquo;s perilous racial situation, and that  <i> &#8220;Mark Steyn is a neocon who couldn&rsquo;t care less if Europe becomes 100% black, as long as the blacks aren&rsquo;t Muslim&#8221;</i>&hellip; and that Islam itself is not so much the problem as the non-whites living in white societies.  While religion is not exempt from valid concern, and Steyn has part of the picture, this is essentially a racial confrontation. Those who try to define it as solely religious are serving to distract us from the real menace that we face.</p>

		<p>as an american in europe, I can only hope that this fascist, totalitarian law triggers a backlash: the election of a new, anti-immigration government in Finland. </p>
<p>That is the trend in the EU nowadays, and it is precisely the popularity of the new white civil rights movement here that has caused this hysterical reaction by the government.</p>
<p>I have watched for 15 years as popular opinion in europe has turned decisively against muslim and 3rd world immigration. </p>
<p>the minaret referendum in switzerland, and the new militancy found among italians: all of this points toward a new assertivenes among whites here.   </p>
<p>the only q. is: is it too late?</p>

<p>What is pathetically interesting is that every country has it&rsquo;s own parasitic immigrant group.  Pakistanis in UK, Moroccans in Holland, Congolese and other French speaking africans and Algerians in France, Turks in Germany.  It seems all EU countries went into self destruct mode independently.</p>

<p>  I assume that American Renaissance would be included in the prohibited &#8220;white civil rights&#8221; websites? This would mean any visit to AR by a Finn  could lead to a four year prison sentence.  Why did Finnish patriots waste so much blood fighting communism, if Finland will now adopt communist thought control?</p>

The Hate Crime Bill got attached to military funding and is now law.

		<p>16) is right.  My Finnish friend told me that watching crime reports on the news is much like watching it here.  Whenever race of the perp. is mentioned, they&rsquo;re always black.</p>
<p>If Finns are becoming more racist, that is both their fault for letting in blacks and the fault of blacks for proving every stereotype about them accurate. </p>

<p>This is why I&rsquo;m suspicious of anyone who views the issue of immigration to Europe from an Islamic perspective.  There are many European countries where the non-muslim nonwhites outnumber the muslim ones like Britain or Spain and yet the spectre of the Islamic boogeyman is constantly being raised. Why?  Only a neocon would think that America will be the last nation standing.  We are 60% White and the least Western of all the industrial nations and we are in sharp decline.  There is no mistake that we will be the first to go!!!!<br>

		<p>AR had a great article (sorry for the redundancy) in its printed edition a few years ago about race politics in Finland.  Its point is that ethnic Swedes, a small but powerful minority, do everything they can to district (real) Finns from Swedish power.  So I bet there is ethnic Swedish influence behind this law.  For if real Finns start recognizing race, then it follows they will also recognize ethnicity, and therefore recognize disproportionate Swedish influence.</p>
<p>To answer Lex Concord, yes, the Finns did fight the Russians valiantly.  However, Finland suffered for decades from an internal fifth column of political communists, and it was almost entirely Swedes doing it.  NOT because the Swedes actually believed in communism, but the Swedes wanted to distract Finns with an external enemy to &#8220;combat&#8221; and &#8220;fight,&#8221; so that they don&rsquo;t combat the Swedes.  Finns would be more likely to fight the big bad Russians if an overtly &#8220;communist&#8221; party or &#8220;communist&#8221; sympathizer held power, which they/it did in Finland for quite a long time.  When the USSR collapsed, the Swedish Finns lost its useful external bogeyman.  So now they&rsquo;re dwelling on criminalizing racially nationalist thought and expression.  And I predict Finland&rsquo;s laws will be worst of all.  Linus Torvalds&rsquo;s (Finnish of Swedish ethnicity) parents were both soi-distant communists, as an example. </p>

While I don&rsquo;t think the racial situation is better or worse in Europe, just different according to the particular country,&#8221;</p>
<p>Europe is worse.  The US non-white immigrants are better assimilated and less hostile to the country that took them in.  Not to say it is not a bad situation, just better than europe which is terminal.  Violence in the US is dropping while violence in europe is skyrocketing (for example).</p>

<p>&#8220;Europe is worse. The US non-white immigrants are better assimilated and less hostile to the country that took them in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now apart from EU or US (I want to avoid a discussion of the pathetic question of which continent is the better)</p>
<p>Its a ridiculous statement you made. The more assimilated the immigration is the worse for the future of the original people, because:</p>
<p>As with a living body (your country, your nation) you only can extract the parts (people, groups etc) which are affected if these parts have a clear boarder line to the healthy parts. Things should not be mixed as one must be able to distinguish those who must go from those who have to stay.</p>
<p>Thinks will change with time, people will change politics will change, I am sure there will sometime come a time frame when liberals will not anymore maintain total control over politics, because its evident that as the chaos rises it will be harder to control the &#8220;sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>The question is, that will at that future time remain enough healthy and cohesive block of white people remain to save themselves, and eventually make that surgery I was talking about or will we go the way of the Romans, the ancient Greeks, Egypt, and I don&rsquo;t know who else&hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8220;In my opinion, European civilization reached its zenith around 1910 and has been in a state of massive decline and retreat ever since.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would have to disagree.  The EU is already the world&rsquo;s largest economy and in ten years, maybe less, the euro will become the world&rsquo;s reserve currency.  London has replaced New York as the financial capital of the world while the standard of living in many parts of Europe has surpassed that of the US.  Europe produces the majority of scientific papers in the world and is beginning to surge ahead of the US in technology.  Look at the impressive Hadron Collider they built in Switzerland.  If anything it looks to me as if this Mexihaiti third world nation that I used to call America is dying and Europe is in ascendancy.  </p>
