			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Schmidt, Chronicle of Higher Education, January 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Having held in a landmark 2003 Supreme Court ruling that diverse college enrollments have proven educational benefits but that colleges should not need race-conscious admissions policies 25 years down the road, a retired associate justice  &mdash;  Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor  &mdash;  is now singing what some hear as a different tune.</p>
<p>In an essay written with Stewart J. Schwab, who had served as one of her Supreme Court clerks and is now dean of the Cornell Law School, Justice O&rsquo;Connor argues that the majority opinion she wrote in the 2003 affirmative-action case should not be seen as imposing a deadline on the use of race-conscious policies or as relieving the need for more research showing such policies have educational benefits.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the time comes to reassess the constitutionality of considering race in higher-education admissions,&#8221; the essay says, &#8220;we will need social scientists to clearly demonstrate the educational benefits of diverse student bodies, and to better understand the links between role models in one generation and aspirations and achievements of succeeding generations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The essay, contained in the new book The Next 25 Years: Affirmative Action in Higher Education in the United States and South Africa, has struck a raw nerve among critics of affirmative action who were frustrated by the pivotal role Justice O&rsquo;Connor played in preserving race-conscious admissions policies in the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger decision, involving the University of Michigan Law School. Seen as the court&rsquo;s swing vote on the affirmative-action issue, she ended up siding with its liberal wing in a 5-to-4 ruling holding that race-conscious admissions policies are constitutional because they serve the compelling state interest of promoting diversity and its associated educational benefits.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad she is no longer on the Supreme Court,&#8221; said Roger B. Clegg, president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, which opposes racial and ethnic preferences and had submitted a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of Barbara Grutter, the rejected white applicant to Michigan&rsquo;s law school who was the plaintiff in the case.</p>
<p>Justice O&rsquo;Connor, Mr. Clegg [Roger B. Clegg, president of the Center for Equal Opportunity] said, &#8220;is not a social scientist by training, and the problem with her jurisprudence is that she would too often try to be a social scientist rather than a justice. She tried to make policy rather than interpret laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Terence J. Pell, president of the Center for Individual Rights, which provided legal assistance to Ms. Grutter, said, &#8220;I think the fact Justice O&rsquo;Connor is doing this reflects the fundamental weakness of the opinion she offered: It failed to offer a principled basis for limiting  &mdash;  or even judging the effectiveness of  &mdash;  these practices.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Everyone&rsquo;s Worst Fears&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>In her majority opinion in the Grutter case, Justice O&rsquo;Connor wrote: &#8220;We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.&#8221; That sentence was widely regarded as a prediction that the Supreme Court would be less willing to give its blessing to race-conscious admissions policies a quarter century down the road, and as giving the nation&rsquo;s educational institutions an informal deadline for finding alternatives to race-conscious admissions policies and closing race-linked gaps in educational achievement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In her new essay, Justice O&rsquo;Connor says, &#8220;That 25-year expectation is, of course, far from binding on any justices who may be responsible for entertaining a challenge to an affirmative-action program in 2028.&#8221; The task before those justices will be the same as the task before others who previously took up the issue, &#8220;applying abstract constitutional principles to concrete educational endeavors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Pell {snip} [Terence J. Pell, president of the Center for Individual Rights] said Justice O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s essay reflects &#8220;a significant change of posture&#8221; from the Grutter decision&rsquo;s language. &#8220;What I found surprising was the extent to which the authors confirmed everyone&rsquo;s worst fears about this 25-year limit  &mdash;  namely, that is not a limit at all, but rather an opening bid in an effort to justify the use of race preferences in perpetuity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Studies by &#8216;Scholars of All Stripes&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The essay she wrote with Dean Schwab similarly argues that campus diversity provides several educational benefits. But it then says: &#8220;We hesitate to cite scholarly work to back our speculations in this part. Certainly useful studies have already been conducted on the benefits from diverse student bodies, but in our view more needs to be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The essay speaks approvingly of research by Robert D. Putnam, a professor of public policy at Harvard University, who has found that ethnically diverse neighborhoods tend to have less trust and cooperation. &#8220;The importance of the topic should not prevent us from asking questions whose answers might disappoint us,&#8221; the essay says.</p>
<p>{snip} Mr. Clegg said, &#8220;She seems to think that social science can give definitive answers, and of course it cannot. Social science is so malleable and so political that you can find social scientists who will give you whatever answer you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Succinct account of Putnam&rsquo;s findings on diversity&rsquo;s toll on trust, social cohesion:</p>
<p>Harvard study paints bleak picture of ethnic diversity<br>

<p>For recent insights  &mdash;  including Putnam&rsquo;s struggle in presenting his findings to a Harvard seminar on public policy, see &#8220;A Smart Solution to the Diversity Dilemma,&#8221;<br>
Jason Richwine, The American, August 12, 2009<br>
https://www.american.com/archive/2009/august/dealing-with-diversity-the-smart-way </p>
<p>Excerpt: &#8220;After finishing his presentation of the data, Putnam began a class discussion. He asked us whether we thought that all relevant scientific findings, no matter how disagreeable, deserve a public airing. Perhaps he was just trying to get us to think about difficult issues, but Putnam seemed genuinely conflicted himself. His concerns were rooted, understandably, in his personal politics. A man of the Left, he told us that he was deeply worried about being seen as advocating some form of &lsquo;ethnic cleansing,&rsquo; or being associated with the far Right in general.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Affirmative action and racial quotas are here to stay. Maybe 100 years from now the Hispanics and Asians will end quotas for blacks, but in our lifetime it will be &#8220;Affirmative Action Today, Affirmative Action Tomorrow, Affirmative Action Forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>On this issue there is absolutely no difference between the Democrats and the GOP.</p>
<p>This is yet another racial misfortune that whites will just have to live with.</p>

		<p>Human beings are active strategizers. If we are told a fact, such as Putnam&rsquo;s findings, we&rsquo;ll modify our actions. If you tell us that diverse neighborhoods are less trusting and cooperative then we react and make our neighborhoods even more so. Those of us who are opposed to increasing diversity will make extra efforts to make our neighborhoods unpleasant so as to stop the increase in diversity. </p>

<p>Yes, of course you do - for no genuine scholarly work exists that can even remotely prove any tangible, academic benefit of campus &#8220;diversity.&#8221; And no serious work of this kind ever will surface, as no such benefit exists - the very idea is so utterly absurd, that apprently for that reason alone very smart people seem compelled to believe it.   </p>

<p>I would tend to disagree with that statement. The statement at the end of the article is more interesting, &#8220;Social science is so malleable and so political that you can find social scientists who will give you whatever answer you like&#8221;. That&rsquo;s seems more accurate. We&rsquo;ve had 100 years or more of social science concerned with what is happening and what is good for non-whites, and blacks in particular, at the exclusion of all else. And what do you know, what they set out and set up to investigate is what they find; Nothing more.  <br>

		<p>What is she saying? That for the next 25 years the black illegitimacy rate is going to stay above 70% and society is going to have to discriminate against white men to make up for the disadvantage?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s &#8216;worked&rsquo; for 40 years why not another 25?</p>

		<p>I remember this betrayal of O&rsquo;Connor toward conservative principles. However, I could swear that she at the time, stated that 25 years might not be long enough, so her &#8220;essay&#8221; comes as no surprise to me. She was appointed by the so-called great conservative Ronald Reagan.</p>

		<p>Well, don&rsquo;t expect the Republican party to do anything about ending Affirmative Action programs.  Their candidates may run their campaigns with promises to the contrary, remember George H.W. Bush&rsquo;s remarks that &#8220;this country will not be run by the numbers&#8221; if he was elected President.  Well, he was and that was the last you ever heard of it.  Republican politicians whether running for local, state or national office, will use this issue to dupe White males into supporting them and voting them into office, but once that is accomplished, it&rsquo;s &#8220;see you later.&#8221;  They are quite comfortable with the quotas, racial set-asides, and other affirmative action policies that are in use in this country and they will not do anything to change them.  They won&rsquo;t even broach the subject, nor will so called &#8216;Right Wing&rsquo; think tnaks such as the Heritage Foundation.  They steer clear of that subject as it is opening a Pandora&rsquo;s Box for them.</p>
<p>Consevatives, especially White males, should demand to know a political candidate&rsquo;s position on affirmative action and other policies that impact negatively on whites before even thinking about voting them into office.  Get it in writing is the best way.  The point is that neither the Democrat or Republican parites will stop this evil.  We need a third party in this country that is totally against it.</p>

		<p>In my earlier post I forgot to include the boost that President Rhard M. Nixon gave to affirmative action policies back in 1970.  They are as follows:</p>
<p>1970 - The Labor Department, under President Richard M. Nixon, issued Order No. 4, authorizing flexible goals and timetables to correct &#8220;underutilization of minorities by federal contractors.&#8221;</p>
<p>1971 - Order No. 4 was revised to include women.</p>
<p>1971 - President Nixon issued E.O. 11625, directing federal agencies to develop comprehensive plans and specific program goals for a Minority Business Enterprise(MBE) contracting program.</p>
<p>1973 - The Nixon administration issued &#8220;Memorandum Permissable Goals and Timetables in State and Local Government Employment Practices,&#8221;describing between proper goals and timetables and impermissable quotas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, you have to remember that he also promised to end the Viet Nam &#8220;war&#8221; if elected but he kept it going for another seven years.  As I wrote earlier, you cannot trust any politician to keep their word, especially those trying to get the white male vote.  Nixon did more than any other President to further the reaches of affirmative action policies that contue to discriminate against white males.</p>

I&rsquo;ve said it before. We have endless theories to explain black failure which requires special programs to implement. However, the special programs never work. So they have to come up with new theories to explain why the old theory didn&rsquo;t work and then find yet another theory to replace the failed theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an endless cycle theory, new theory, revised theory, and on and on.  </p>

<p>Much better would be to take the power to nullify unconstitutional laws out of the hands of judges altogether and give it to juries. This, I believe, was what the Founding Fathers intended. For more information, visit fija.org.</p>

<p>Social scientists?  Now that&rsquo;s an oxymoron.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as social scientists.  But there are social activists posing as scientists, and there are scientists that ignore science and instead spout PC dogma out of primal fear.</p>

		<p>While I would never discourage someone from posting on this site, I would like to mention that posting on the site of the original article can be elucidating to those who have not found this font of free thinking regarding racial matters. </p>
<p>In case they decide to take it down, here is what I posted on their site: </p>
<p>11328626&rsquo;s comments above give an explanation for Black underachievement and contrast it with the relative achievement of Jews in America. She/he gives an explanation for why Blacks underachieve in America relative to Whites (and presumably Jews). I however disagree with her/his assertions of the cause for relative Black underachievement. </p>
<p>The &#8220;generational effects&#8221; he/she claims are difficult to substanitiate when one considers that those of African Ancestry in other Western countries are not any better off. Blacks in Britain and other Western countries generally underachieve academically and financially even though they have not experienced &#8220;generational effects&#8221; such as slavery. Additionally North East Asians and Indians (those from India) in America continue to experience greater success in the two aforementioned areas compared to Whites even though they are typically easily distinguishable from Whites; and in the case of North East Asians, have experienced protracted discrimination themselves.</p>
<p>If it were the case that physical differences in appearance were the main cause of the racial disparities of interest we would see that North East Asians were somewhere between Whites and Blacks - This is not the case. </p>
<p>The views espoused by 11328626 are those of multiculturists that cannot stand the more parsimonious idea that Blacks&rsquo; underachievement is because of less cognitive ability, a propensity toward Psychological disorders and a general lack of inhibition. In my opinion North East Asians prosper in America because they have the very opposite characteristics (Major Depression being an exception). Similarly Indians prosper because those that come to this country have many of the same qualities as North East Asians and more importantly perhaps, are the product of massive brain drain - as is evidenced by studies showing the Indian IQ being around 90 and the general disfunctionality of their society when compared to the West. </p>
<p>I believe that such a view is devoid of the tortured rationalizations that come with believing that culture arises from nothing and that a people are in no way responsible for their own condition.</p>
<p>Sandra and supporters&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the time comes to reassess the constitutionality of considering race in higher-education admissions,&#8221; the essay says, &#8220;we will need social scientists to clearly demonstrate the educational benefits of diverse student bodies, and to better understand the links between role models in one generation and aspirations and achievements of succeeding generations.&#8221;</p>
<p>If we need those conclusions to be more certain in the future, what explains your decision? Did it matter less then?  </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;holding that race-conscious admissions policies are constitutional because they serve the compelling state interest of promoting diversity and its associated educational benefits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many like to ballyhoo about the benefits of diversity, but I am still waiting for the benefits that it is supposed to have. If social science is inconclusive on the matter, as the previous quote had suggested, why would we assume it was in the national interest?</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Payton of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund interpreted the essay mainly as a call for social scientists to better defend educational diversity in the political arena, to counter efforts to curtail affirmative action through legislation and referenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is antithetical for scientists to defend anything other than objective truth. It is inevitable that scientists would have certain political views, but it is unacceptable that they let their views color their conclusions. If they can come to the conclusion that diversity is beneficial in general, then so be it. I am doubtful to say the least. If it were up to Mr. Payton I wonder if we would have anything that truly qualifies as science at all. </p>
<p>&#8220;unless substantial progress is made, higher education will continue to face the dilemma of choosing between educational achievement and diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a way, this is the most reasonable quote attributed to her in the article. She still however seems to be juxtaposing the real world where you have more of what she calls diversity (more Hispanics and Blacks), where a &#8220;diversified&#8221; student population almost always means dumbing down the curriculum and her fantasy where we can finally hold hands as we stroll through the field of candy canes and gum drops that is our world. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I might point out that the Jewish community was for some time one of the biggest allies of African Americans in the struggle for civil rights. This was often in the form of members of the community who, despite their own ability to escape a particular racial discrimination like blacks, still knew, remembered, and refused to silently allow the horror of ruthless discrimination to go unchallenged on their watch. They also recognized that the educational and economic success of the Jewish community in the U.S. was owed in part to their ability to eventually racially assimilate, as the longstanding stereotypes of physical Jewishness faded in the Anglo population. They were able to pass or at least were admitted to whiteness in some measure. Italian Americans, Irish, and Slavic populations in the U.S. should remember this as well, because that have all endured a brief, racist holdup before being admitted to whiteness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poster 11328626 confused racism with sectarianism.  The only Jews that have ever stood out like a sore thumb in this country are the Hasidic Orthodox Jews and that is because of the unusual way they dress &hellip; much like Orthodox Muslims do, especially the women.  In conventional clothing, the Ashkenazi Jews don&rsquo;t look any different from most Northern or Central  Caucasians and the darkest Sephardic Jews wouldn&rsquo;t stand out from Mediterranean Caucasians.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;brief, racist holdup&rdquo; to whiteness for Jews, Catholics like the Irish and Italians, and Eastern Orthodox  like the Greeks and the Slavs only lasted as long as their strongly cohesive, ethnic neighborhoods did.  Those were deliberately shattered by school desegregation, forced busing, block-busting and low-income &ldquo;housing&rdquo; in order to effect &ldquo;white flight&rdquo; - interesting how they entered The Hallowed Halls of Whiteness only then which diffused their power by scattering them all over hell&rsquo;s half acre.  Only their areas were affected by this.  Otherwise, direct me to the Scandinavian and German areas of the country the WASPoliticians felt needed more &ldquo;diversity.&ldquo;  It&rsquo;s a testament to their phenomenal ethnic cohesion, that Jews were the least impacted by this, but they were still affected none the same.   Having the same, intact neighborhoods would have made it much easier for young Jewish males to find nice Jewish girls to wed, that&rsquo;s for sure.  </p>
<p>Some may point out to the Cuomos, the Kennedys, various Jews, the Black Caucus, etc. as examples that belie my theory about WASPoliticians, but they have voted for so many measures that actively hurt and endanger their own people that they might as well be WASPs as well. <br>

		<p>Whatever the excuses are for black &#8216;underachievement&rsquo;, by focusing on the experiences of blacks (whatever the opinion might be), isn&rsquo;t this pretty much playing into the hands of the media, and playing the game pretty much the way they would like it played? </p>

		<p>These justices are so out of tune with the general population its ridiculous.  They&rsquo;re useless, power hungry, parasitic, influence merchants and - YES - their own personal views are the basis of their rulings.  Let&rsquo;s start electing honest people to the bench - all benches - where they have to answer directly to the American people.</p>
<p>Nice talk but let&rsquo;s face it, we&rsquo;re not too good at electing honest politicians&hellip;. we&rsquo;re fools all the way around.<br>
