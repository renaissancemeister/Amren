<h1>Democrats Protest Proposed School Standards</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gary Scharrer, Express-News (San Antonio), January 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Conservative rallying points like the Heritage Foundation, Moral Majority and National Rifle Association made it into a preliminary set of new curriculum standards for Texas public school students, but an effort to include other groups in the political arena  &mdash;  like ones that fight discrimination  &mdash;  failed Friday, causing some to question the effect of the partisan balance on the State Board of Education.</p>
<p>After two days of wrestling over what to teach lower grades, the board postponed a first-round vote until March because it could not finish a review of proposed social studies standards for high school students. The March vote will produce curriculum standards for a public hearing in May, when final action is expected.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So far, conservative groups are generally pleased with the early look at the new standards that will influence a decade of school textbooks for more than 4.7 million Texas public school children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The board restored Christmas as an example of a significant religious celebration, overturning a much-criticized expert recommendation, and explorer Christopher Columbus is slated for more mention than businesswoman Mary Kay Ash.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But board member Mary Helen Berlanga, D-Corpus Christi, was not happy after colleagues rejected her amendment that would have exposed students to the historic significance of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, League of United Latin American Citizens, GI Forum and Raza Unida.</p>
<p>&#8220;They obviously had the votes, so even if I protested, it wasn&rsquo;t going to do much good,&#8221; Berlanga said later. &#8220;It is very obvious that they were carrying forward a political agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Berlanga also failed to get U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonya Sotomayor listed as an example of someone with significant historical accomplishment and achievement. Republican members offered the late Supreme Justice Benjamin Cardozo, who was of Portuguese descent.</p>
<p>&#8220;That didn&rsquo;t satisfy her agenda,&#8221; Bradley said. &#8220;She rejected him. The other guy was not a liberal Hispanic. He&rsquo;s Portuguese. That wasn&rsquo;t brown enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hispanic children now make up the majority of students in the public school early elementary grades and soon will become the majority of the entire K-12 enrollment. White children make up 34 percent of the public school enrollment.</p>
<p>Social studies experts last year recommended that high school students evaluate the contributions and significance of political and social leaders such as Andrew Carnegie, Billy Graham, Barry Goldwater, Hector P. Garcia, and Thurgood Marshall among others.</p>
<p>Don McLeroy, R-Bryan, wanted to add: Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Oveta Culp Hobby, Newt Gingrich, William Buckley, Hillary Clinton and Clair Booth Luce to the list. The addition of such Republican conservatives as Kirkpatrick, Gingrich, Buckley and Luce influenced Democratic members to push for the inclusion of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy. The board voted down Kennedy and also an effort to include the entire Kennedy family.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McLeroy also lost an effort to replace &#8220;hip hop&#8221; with country music on a list of significant examples of cultural movements in art, music and literature for Texas high school students to study.</p>
<p>The experts last year recommended such examples as Tin Pan Alley, the Harlem Renaissance, the Beat Generation, Rock and Roll, the Chicano mural movement and hip hop.</p>
<p>McLeroy tried to replace hip hop with country music, arguing with other social conservatives that hip-hop and related &#8220;gangsta rap&#8221; uses foul language and often denigrates women.</p>
<p>&#8220;The words are degrading,&#8221; Terri Leo, R-Spring, said. &#8220;We don&rsquo;t have to use words that students cannot use in school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lawrence Allen Jr., D-Houston, said hip-hop is a major form of communication in the black community and should remain an option for teachers to use.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do think hip-hop is? Maybe you are deleting something that you know nothing about?&#8221; he suggested to his colleagues.</p>
<p>McLeroy&rsquo;s country music-for-hip-hop amendment failed, 7-7, but could survive later along with many amendments that failed on tie votes when Lowe casts a vote.</p>
<p>The Texas Freedom Network, an Austin-based group that monitors the State Board of Education in support of religious and civil liberties, complained about &#8220;blatant politicization of social studies curriculum.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Miller&rsquo;s group [Kathy Miller, president of the Texas Freedom Network], in particular, objected to the board:</p>
<p>* Approving an amendment suggesting that 1950s McCarthyism had been justified.</p>
<p>* Adopting a standard that specifically promotes the views of conservative icons, groups or concepts  &mdash;  included by name were Phyllis Schlafly, the Contract with America, the Heritage Foundation, the Moral Majority and the National Rifle Association  &mdash;  while ignoring liberal politics and political figures.</p>
<p>* Removing a specific requirement that students learn about the efforts of women and ethnic minorities to gain equal rights, replacing it with vague language about &#8220;various groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>It would be a gross exaggeration to say these changes are even a preliminary step to restoring any historical accuracy or cultural legitimacy to what Texas public school students learn.  More than a decade ago, when I first perused our local Texas school&rsquo;s first grade social studies textbook, I saw only three individuals mentioned:  George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King (so sorry, but in my humble opinion MLK is nowhere near George Washington&rsquo;s standing to be so honored).  This was when my then six-year old son had already memorized, of his own volition, all of the presidents and was methodically reading various biographies of his favorites.  However, the social studies books are merely one thread in the jarring multicultural tapestry that is public education today.  Last year&rsquo;s reading textbook contained Hmong fairy tales, stories about the African American Museum, Puerto Rico, and diversity stories ad nauseam; nary a mention, however, of Pecos Bill and genuine American folk tales.  My younger son  was constantly pausing, in his reading book, to decipher the various black and latino names deliberately and liberally sprinkled throughout.  I have since moved him, like his older brother, to a private Christian school where he will read books with a more varied and advanced Latin/Greek root vocabulary, greater truly American content, and overall superior literacy.  Even a liberal like Dorothy Rabinvitch (can&rsquo;t remember the name of her book about social studies and literature textbooks)has compared textbooks and confirmed the vast superiority of Christian school textbooks, particularly those from Bob Jones University (oh, the horror!).  </p>

<p>And, of course, she isn&rsquo;t. In fact she isn&rsquo;t only pursuing a political agenda, she&rsquo;s pursuing an anti-American one.</p>
<p>What a shame to see the country deteriorate so dramatically.  The American empire is cracking badly, and like all empires it is doomed to expire&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.soon.</p>

		<p>I think moderation is the key here.  Definitely Christmas should be in - but why Phyllis Schafly?  And who is Olveta Culp Hobby?  And who cares?  The fact is, MAJOR influential figures should be included, NOT for their race or political agenda, but because their efforts have withstood the test of time to determine worthiness.  To put contemporaries such as Hillary Clinton on the list makes a mockery of &#8220;history,&#8221; since by definition what history is, is what happened in the PAST, not the present.  My personal opinion is that if a worthy candidate&rsquo;s works are 25 or more years old, then include them; if not, then wait until they HAVE that quarter-century to validate the worth of their contribution(s).  And with music particularly, you need AT LEAST 25 years to determine whether it will withstand the test of time.  Hip-hop is popular today; but it uses filthy language and degrades women, so for me these things would automatically disqualify it.  I don&rsquo;t care what kind of communication tool for its constituents it is - if it&rsquo;s filthy and degrading it has no place in children&rsquo;s history books.  The women&rsquo;s movement IS over 25 years old and should be included, as is the civil rights movement as carried forward by Dr. Martin Luther King.  Common sense and moderation should be the criteria here - can we all grow up a little here, people?  </p>

		<p>After reading this article, I&rsquo;m once again compelled to ask the question, &#8220;why on earth would any American that is satisfied with the European inherited culture we have had for over two-hundred years vote for a political party(Democ-RATS)that is fanatical, ABSOLUTELY FANATICAL, about eliminating that culture? Some people have argued that the Republicans don&rsquo;t care about European-American culture either. That may be true, but for them it almost seems to be an incidental thing. Not for the Democrats, they are deadly serious in their zeal to eliminate/replace it.</p>

		<p>The political correctness in history books is truly laughable.  Bill Gates is worth a mention since he has had a very significant impact on America but Mary Kay?  What does the founder of the Amway of the cosmetic world have to do with anything?  They are merely stretching it to find female role models.</p>

		<p>The conservatives are celebrating the fact that some pseudo-American culture will be taught to a mostly Mexican student body in the hopes that they will assimiliate into the American mainstream and probably miscegenate with Whites?  This is a victory?  A real victory would be deporting them back to their own country where they can learn their history.</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Hispanic children now make up the majority of students in the public school early elementary grades and soon will become the majority of the entire K-12 enrollment&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This portends the future of school text books in Texas, and probably the rest of the US eventually as well.  Once Hispanics form a large enough voting bloc, they WILL be the majority of the school board and the racist, ethno-centric views of Berlanga will prevail.</p>
<p>Textbooks will reflect not only the  &#8220;historic significance of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, League of United Latin American Citizens, GI Forum and Raza Unida&#8221; but Hispanic &#8216;freedom fighters&rsquo; will be given credit for wresting this country away from genocidal Whites in order to form &#8216;a more perfect union&rsquo;  &mdash;  a Third World union, which is the only one they&rsquo;re capable of forming. </p>
<p>Statues will be raised to Sonia Sotomayor, Che Guevara, Castro, Hugo Chavez and other Hispanic heroes, White statues torn down, history will be (is being) rewritten and our heritage, culture and innovations will be sent down the memory hole.  Whites will be (are being) marginalized, debased and hated, our history and culture considered one of slavery, genocide and mass murder against non-Whites.</p>
<p>Just for fun, I pulled out an old History/Literature high school text from the early 60s.  </p>
<p>Here is a sample of some of the required reading for that time (when the US was 90% White):</p>
<p>under poetry:</p>
<p>Edna St. Vincent Millay&rsquo;s &#8220;God&rsquo;s World&#8221;, Carl Sandburg &#8220;The Copperfaces, the Red Men&#8221;</p>
<p>under Colonial Times: &#8220;The First Psalm&#8221;, &#8220;On the Creation&#8221;, &#8220;The Alphabet&#8221;  (&#8216;In Adam&rsquo;s Fall, We Sinned All&rsquo;, &#8216;Heaven to Find, the Bible Mind&rsquo;).</p>
<p>From The Making of a Nation:  selections from Patrick Henry, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and George Washington&rsquo;s &#8216;Farewell Address.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From The War Between the States (yes, that is the title of the section, not the &#8216;Civil War&rsquo;:  Glimpses of Lee:  Robert E. Lee Reader, &#8220;Letter to his Son&#8221;, &#8220;Lee&rsquo;s Return to Richmond&#8221;, &#8220;Lee in Later Life.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a mandated California State high school textbook, it is not from the South.</p>
<p>It would send a multi-culturalist, egaltarian, government Kommisar into apoplectic fits.  </p>
<p>I treasure this textbook, read it often and will hide it when the NWO authoritarians burn any books that reflect White culture in a positive light  &mdash;  I may have to memorize it if I cannot keep it from being burned.</p>
<p>How far we&rsquo;ve fallen.  How far we&rsquo;ve fallen.</p>

		<p>Historical footnote:  Olveta Culp Hobby campaigned for the Army to recruit women for the first time in it&rsquo;s history during World War II.  Not what you would call a women&rsquo;s libber; she pointed out that each woman in uniform replaced a man who would then be eligible to go someplace to be shot at.  At her urging, the Army founded the Women&rsquo;s Army Auxiliary Corps in 1942.  In 1943, this was changed into the Women&rsquo;s Army Corps, making the WACs actual members of the U.S. Army instead of &#8220;auxiliaries&#8221;.  Hobby was made a U.S. Army colonel and was in charge of the organization and training of all WACs.</p>

		<p>This country is trying to change history to make it politically correct. But history is just that - HISTORY. It is neither right or wrong; it is simply history. You can twist it around, change the story, but you can&rsquo;t change the facts no matter how much you want to. The sad part is that the students who actually do take anything away from their schooling are learning the distorted nonsense as truth.</p>
