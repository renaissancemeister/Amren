			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrik Jonsson, Christian Science Monitor, January 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In what&rsquo;s being seen as an attempt at redemption by a state touched by recent political embarrassment, a panel of South Carolina lawmakers has voted to change the state&rsquo;s lynching law.</p>
<p>Why? {snip} For decades, the law has been used to address African-American gang activity, with over half of all lynching charges and convictions being levied against blacks.</p>
<p>The South Carolina Sentencing Reform Commission voted Monday to rename the law &#8220;assault and battery by a mob&#8221; and to soften consequences for situations in which no one was killed or seriously injured in an attack by two or more people on a single victim.</p>
<p>The emotional and historical power of the word &#8220;lynching&#8221;  &mdash;  especially in the Deep South, where the majority of lynchings happened  &mdash;  has long been seen by critics as especially cruel when applied to instances in which black men are arrested.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Lynching is a particular type of crime&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Lynching is a particular type of crime that has been recognized socially and by the state as having certain distinct attributes, and so the [South Carolina lynching law] is a corruption not only of the idea of what a lynching is, but also the historical memory of what a lynching is,&#8221; says University of North Carolina history Prof. Fitzhugh Brundage, who has written on black historical memory in the South since the Civil War.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The South Carolina lynching law has been used to prosecute both blacks and whites, but came under fire in 2003 when the Associated Press reported that it was being frequently used and that 69 percent of its targets were young black men, and 67 percent of those convicted for lynching were black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Lynching law a tool to fight gang crime?</b></p>
<p>For law enforcement agencies, however, the law had become an effective tool to fight urban gang crime. Former Charleston, S.C., police chief Reuben Greenberg, the city&rsquo;s first black chief, told the AP that he had used it many times, primarily to control gang problems in the old port city.</p>
<p>Trey Walker, a spokesman for state Attorney General Henry McMaster, told the AP in 2003 that since there&rsquo;s no mention of race in the statue, &#8220;The law is colorblind.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that explanation didn&rsquo;t ring true with the Sentencing Reform Commission, whose changes still have to be approved by the legislature.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was brought to our attention that, &#8216;Look, this name has a negative connotation and people are being charged with something that really has nothing to do with what people perceive to be lynching,&rsquo; &#8221; says Rep. Murrell Smith, the Republican chairman of the reform commission.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the law&rsquo;s modern application may be &#8220;grotesque,&#8221; as Professor Brundage puts it, the fact is that South Carolina was the one Deep South state to actually fight back against lynchings during the years of the brutal practice.</p>
<p><b>Other states had many more lynchings</b></p>
<p>{snip} South Carolina prosecutors became the first ones in the South to use an anti-ynching law in the mid-1920s to give redress to the family of a black man lynched while county authorities looked the other way.</p>
<p>Still, in the wake of the long-running controversy over the Confederate flag on the state capitol grounds, Rep. Joe Wilson&rsquo;s &#8220;You lie!&#8221; outburst during President Obama&rsquo;s healthcare speech to Congress, and Gov. Mark Sanford&rsquo;s brush with impeachment over an affair with a woman in Argentina, some commentators see in the changes to the lynching law a growing sensitivity among lawmakers over the state&rsquo;s national profile and reputation.</p>
<p>&#8220;South Carolina has been embarrassed by a series of racially tinged scandals, and to look at South Carolina as a place where they&rsquo;re prosecuting African-Americans for lynching of all things, how&rsquo;s that going to look and play in terms of national politics and national PR?&#8221; says Earl Ofari Hutchinson, a political analyst and the author of the upcoming book &#8220;How Obama Governed: The year of crisis and challenge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that South Carolina is beginning to come to grips and wrestle with this black eye and realize that this is an embarrassing law,&#8221; he says.</p>

		<p>Once again, the offender triumph&rsquo;s over his victim. The irony is that most of the victims who will have one less tool in their defence against Black gang violence will be other Blacks. While White on Black violence is (mostly)a thing of the past, even Black on White violence is dwarfed by Black on Black violence. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sad time when the sentiment against putting another [guilty]Black man in prison, is much louder than that against putting another [innocent] Black man in the grave.</p>

		<p>Just as anti-lynching laws have been turned around and used against blacks, because of their implications beyond a lethal use of rope, I think the same will eventually happen with hate crimes laws.</p>
<p>And while it is true that the law is color-blind, the problem is that far many more blacks than whites seem to run afoul of it.  Any law or mechanism that is race neutral will favor whites (if it&rsquo;s something positive like an entrance test for a school or employment) or if it&rsquo;s negative, like a criminal code.</p>

		<p>More white people were &#8220;lynched&#8221; than blacks.  A form of &#8220;frontier justice&#8221;, lynching was routinely used in the old west to exact &#8220;justice&#8221; from horse thieves, cattle rustlers and other criminals when the traditional forms of &#8220;justice&#8221; were not available.<br>
The few examples of blacks being &#8220;lynched&#8221; were used to promote the so-called &#8220;civil-rights&#8221; laws.</p>

		<p>Lynching is mob violence.  Blacks are the ones committing all the mob violence and being charged with lynching.  What&rsquo;s the problem again?  Oh yeah, politics.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read it was closer to 50/50 (from leftists sources themselves). It might be more interesting to compare the crime rates to the lynching that took place. </p>

<p>Not true.</p>
<p>Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against blacks. <b>Forty five percent of their victims are white, 43 percent are black,</b> and 10 percent are Hispanic. When whites commit violent crime, only three percent of their victims are<br>
black.</p>
<p>Blacks are an estimated 39 times more likely to commit a violent crime against a white than vice versa, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery.</p>
<p>Blacks are 2.25 times more likely to commit officially-designated hate crimes against whites than vice versa.</p>

		<p>In Africa, from Kenya on down to Cape Town, lynching is not uncommon among blacks. People who are vilified as common criminals, paedophiles, or witches of evil magic are beaten to death, shot, and sometimes burned with a rubber tire around the torso, known as &#8216;neck-lacing&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Their predilection for lynching can be observed in their frequent &#8216;swarming&rsquo; attacks (see the Jena six).  Blacks are the most common practitioners of fatal lynchings in the world today.</p>

		<p>Lynching used to mean extralegal execution by hanging and was widely practiced in the West, mainly against whites, as well as against blacks in the South.  Lately, I&rsquo;ve noticed that some have included shooting, burning to death, and other killing forms in the definition.  Now SC lawmakers are trying to stretch it further.  It&rsquo;s like the definition of rape.  In some states, groping a woman or giving oral sex to a drunk man is called rape, and the far left apparently wants the public confused about crimes involving minorities and heterosexual conduct.</p>

<p>On the very rare occasion the mainstream establishment, i.e. schools, discuss whites being lynched it is always a white who was some kind of leftist or who could even be tied somehow to the civil rights movement. So, this act could be shown as a kind of terrorism. The few cases of &#8216;terrorism&rsquo; where black mobs lynched white criminals can&rsquo;t be talked about at all. </p>
<p>When you think about it. Criminal punishment could be said to be a form of terrorism. Punishment or violence against one individual designed to send the message of fear to everyone else. Good terrorism, perhaps. </p>
<p>The mainstream establishment has no problem frightening the public with images of male prison rape&hellip; It&rsquo;s almost become a comedy on TV. A very real kind takes place documented by groups like human rights watch. If you were some kind of leftists, and it was men of color being raped in prison, instead of white men (who surely are barely making up for their parsity in prison and are getting a minimum of what they deserve) prison rape could be connected to a government conspiracy of some kind. Certainly to a neglect on the part of the government bordering on criminality and &#8216;racism&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>Lynching, as a form of extrajudicial execution was named for its inventor, Charles Lynch.  He ran a militia that used terror tactics - including extrajudicial execution (murder) - to terrorize British loyalist supporters in Virgina during the American Revolutionary War.  These tactics were retroactively legalized by the Virginia General Assembly in 1782.</p>
<p>If the shoe fits, wear it.  If the term is &#8220;painful&#8221; then don&rsquo;t commit the act.</p>
