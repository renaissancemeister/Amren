			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Isaby, Times of London, January 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When David Cameron set about &#8220;detoxifying&#8221; the Tory brand, one of his first aims was to change the face of the party.</p>
<p>Painfully aware that he was surrounded in Parliament by (fellow) white middle-class men educated at public schools and Oxbridge, he sought to ensure that the next intake of Conservative MPs better reflected the country at large.</p>
<p>If he does become prime minister with even the slimmest of majorities, one thing is certain: he will have presided over the most radical single overhaul of the composition of the parliamentary party in history. Nearly 40 sitting Tory MPs are not seeking re-election  &mdash;  with a further trickle of last-minute retirements expected. Then there is the stark fact that the Conservatives must gain 117 seats to win an overall majority. So more than half of the MPs on the Tory benches after the election are likely to be newcomers.</p>
<p>So what will the Class of 2010 look like? Very different from previous intakes. There will no longer be a sea of almost exclusively white male faces wearing grey and navy suits sitting on the green benches.</p>
<p>In almost a century of female representation in Parliament, only 66 women have ever sat as Conservative MPs. That figure could almost be matched at this one election alone, with 14 women selected for safe seats and more than 30 standing in key marginals (along with a dozen sitting Tory women MPs also expected to be returned again). The days when female MPs would earn Brownie points by sitting strategically close to Mr Cameron for the benefit of the TV cameras will be long gone.</p>
<p>The new intake will be less white and heterosexual too. At present there are only two Tory MPs from an ethnic minority: that should be blown out of the water with Priti Patel and Helen Grant both entering the Commons in safe seats and a host of other non-white candidates standing in top targets. Similarly, the number of openly gay MPs is likely to rise from two to hit double figures.</p>
<p>Much has been made by political opponents of Mr Cameron&rsquo;s education; and a handful of new Old Etonians will join him. But of the 200 candidates most likely to be elected, more were educated at state schools than at independent schools, with the bulk of those at comprehensives.</p>
<p>Many are living Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s dream of social mobility, having grown up on council estates and seen their parents buy their houses. A good number were the first in their families to go to university, while more than 30 candidates did not go to university at all.</p>
<p>As for their politics, the new intake will for the most part be &#8220;Thatcher&rsquo;s Children&#8221;, rather than &#8220;Cameron&rsquo;s Children&#8221;. Yes, some have joined the party since he won the leadership in 2005, but far more came of age politically during the 1980s.</p>
<p>While they are generally socially liberal, sympathetic to localism and in favour of reversing Labour&rsquo;s erosion of civil liberties, they are Thatcherite on Europe, tax, enterprise and defence. They are not, in the main, especially moved by the green agenda that Mr Cameron has so personally embraced. &#8220;Reducing Britain&rsquo;s carbon footprint&#8221; is bottom of their policy priorities, according to research by ConservativeIntelligence.</p>
<p>So when Mr Cameron looks at those sitting behind him after the election, he can be satisfied that he will no longer be looking at several hundred mirror images of himself; but nor will they all be carbon-copy Cameroons  &mdash;  the new Tory Party may yet provide him with another challenge.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Detoxify&#8221;!?  &#8220;Painfully aware&#8221; of being among white men? </p>
<p>The anti-white bigotry on display here defies an adequate expression of disgust. </p>
<p>The English parliament has a history of 800 years ( I refer to the 1215 Magna Carta ).  It was white men who created and administered all of it all along.  That anyone should even think of white men in the parliament as a problem is truly sick. <br>

		<p>Every element, let alone, invention of the modern, civilized, safe, orderly world, is the direct result and product of the white man. The computer you are reading from now, the harnessing of electricity, every facet of every structure, infrastructrure, economy, philosphy, is OF WHITES, BY WHITES, FOR WHITES.<br>
Yet Brit totalitarians-and Americans, Swedes, etc., can&rsquo;t destroy it all quickly enough.<br>
There never has been, or can there ever be, such a case of complete societal suicide as this. You don&rsquo;t come back from extinction.<br>
This is the end of the age.</p>

		<p>The re-branding of the tories as &#8220;caring&#8221; conservatives has been a major factor in the growth of support for the BNP at the recent local government and european elections.The Conservative party of old were rightly or wrongly perceived as traditional nationalists,yet since the cataclysmic election of Tony Blair in 1997 they have been at their wits end about how to challenge the New Labour monolith.The answer seems to have arrived in a decision to morph themselves into a toothless mirror image of Blair/Brown&rsquo;s common purpose zombies.Make no mistake,if Cameron wins(as he is expected to)in May, there will be no reversal of the treason initiated by Blair,rather a consolidation.We are living in a one party state.    </p>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t going to vote for them anyway but it is important the BNP etc. specifically target and campaign in seats held by ethnic minorities. Unbelievable these people are so rude to think they have a right to intefere in our own affairs.</p>

		<p>Mr. Cameron, why are there no Russian, Japanese or black African candidates in the BJP party of India? Why are there no Swedes, Aboriginal Australians and Cherokee Native Americans in the Bangladesh National Party? <br>
British political parties should only have British candidates and by British I do not mean the foreign invaders from outside Europe given &#8216;citizenship&rsquo;. They never belonged, do not belong and never will belong to the British nation.<br>

		<p>Believe it or not one is glad that Cameron is doing this.</p>
<p>There will be a clear difference between so called &#8216;conservatives&rsquo; and the British Nationalist Party.  </p>
<p>British people, please do not make the same mistake that us Yanks and Rebels (hat tip to the South) made in electing the &#8216;compassionate conservative&rsquo; Bush.</p>
<p>You actually have a CHOICE with the British Nationalist Party so please consider it (about the best we can do over here is the Constitution Party so far) </p>

		<p>There is no healthy conservative party anywhere in the West,   control of the mass media means control of the culture and dominance in politics.    The mass media renders democracy largely irrelevant,  no issue truly important to the cultural elite,  particularly no racial issue,  is allowed to be mentioned,  much less debated.    </p>
<p>The history of America for the last 40 years or so has been a history of racial genocide against the former white majority,  mostly through mass immigration.   People often refer to the Republicans as the Stupid Party for supporting this genocide against the people who make up the majority of their supporters, but are they really stupid?    The fact is that they have prospered from the destruction- the so-called &#8220;Southern Strategy&#8221;  really consists of Republicans pretending to uphold tradition and white interests while selling them out to the cultural elite for their own personal aggrandizement and the benefit of Wall Street.   The victims of this strategy are the white supporters of the Republicans, not blacks.   Most of Conservatism has consisted of just this,  coy hints to the victims of cultural Marxism that they&rsquo;ll protect them in order to keep the dollars flowing from their wallets, all the while never intending to do anything.  The  B-girls (C-girls?) teased but they never put out.   We&rsquo;ve turned a corner with &#8220;Compassionate Conservatism&#8221;,  though,  the cultural degradation (read: white-hating racism) has reached a point where the Republicans and Conservatives are no longer even pretending to uphold tradition or the interests of whites,  they have completely caved and now must start wars and squabbles overseas to milk the patriotism of their voters,  the last refuge of scoundrels and clearly the end game for Conservatism.     They&rsquo;re not stupid, they&rsquo;re crooks,  who&rsquo;ve actually rather brilliantly played the immolation of their own people,  they&rsquo;ve used the old protection racket to &#8220;bust out&#8221; the store.      There can be no better example of this than the present housing bust: at its heart a  financial meltdown  caused by the racial politics of the left (essentially a colonial government subsidizing favored colonists in order to control the natives) that the Republicans issued a few for-the-record complaints about but didn&rsquo;t even try to change for fear of being called racist while their Wall Street buddies slurped profits from the racial program through derivatives and such, knowing all the time that the tax-payer would ultimately foot the bill.    The perfect modern American political storm. </p>
<p>The Tories are essentially the same.   (To be fair to both the Republicans and the Tories they do have to appeal to an electorate conditioned by the media.)    Demographically Britain is still whiter than America was in 1960. .    The best that can be hoped for is that the Tories quietly tighten immigration and oppose the EU, thus slowing down but not stopping the inevitable.    Political correctness is far more virulent in Britain, where they actually put you in jail for opposing the regime,  and the Tories won&rsquo;t seriously buck that.   One measure of how far gone they are is whether they will seriously roll back the insane level of politically correct laws in Britain or will they just enforce them at a lower level the way crook Republicans do in America.   British politics are usually a winner take all proposition,  they&rsquo;ll have fewer excuses than the Republicans. </p>

		<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me.  After Barack Obama won the election, the Daily Mail had an article about the Tories (not Labour) wanting to find &#8220;Britain&rsquo;s Barack Obama.&#8221;  If one is found, he or she wouldn&rsquo;t be a Tory, I can tell you that.</p>

		<p>Here in the US, our equivalent of the tories is the Republican party. Just like the Democrats, they are determined to sell us down the river.

		<p>Anonymous @ 2:15, Lord Liverpool was only 1/8 Indian and looked quite white. I don&rsquo;t think that he&rsquo;s a great candidate for an &#8220;Indian&#8221; British Prime Minister. Considering that he was 7/8 English and was considered a white Englishman in his day, he does not really set a precedent for an actual Indian, Pakistani, or Jamaican, etc. Prime Minister of the UK.</p>

<p>Yes this is quite true. As all good and great things will end. But look at it this way&hellip; who will these incompetent 3rd worlders have to blame after a few generations, and they still don&rsquo;t have clean running water, or a car that runs, or a quality education system and infrastructure that is crumbling. The white man won&rsquo;t be around to blame. They need whites. Without us, the rest of the world is sure to follow in extinction. That is a scientific and historic certainty. </p>
