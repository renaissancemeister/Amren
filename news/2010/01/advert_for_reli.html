<h1><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7079231/Advert-for-reliable-workers-banned-as-discrimination-by-Jobcentre-Plus.html">Advert for &#8216;Reliable Workers&rsquo; Banned As Discrimination by Jobcentre Plus</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>London Telegraph, January 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nicole Mamo, 48, wanted to post an advert for a Â£5.80-an-hour domestic cleaner on her local Jobcentre Plus website.</p>
<p>The text of the advert ended by stating that any applicants for the post &#8220;must be very reliable and hard-working&#8221;.</p>
<p>But when Ms Mamo called the Jobcentre Plus in Thetford, Norfolk, the following day she was told that her advert would not be displayed instore.</p>
<p>A Jobcentre Plus worker claimed that the word &#8220;reliable&#8221; meant they could be sued for discriminating against unreliable workers.</p>
<p>Ms Mamo, a mother-of-two, from Boreham Wood, Herts., said the situation was &#8220;ridiculous&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I placed the advert on the website and when I phoned up to check I was told it hadn&rsquo;t been displayed in the job centre itself,&#8221; she said. &#8220;She said &#8216;oh we can&rsquo;t put that advert on the job points&rsquo;. She said it was because they could have cases against them for discriminating against unreliable people.</p>
<p>&#8220;I laughed because I thought that was crazy. We supply the NHS with staff so it&rsquo;s very important for the patients that we have reliable workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We find jobs for hundreds of temporary staff every week and are proud of our workers but our reputation is at stake if they aren&rsquo;t reliable.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are taking people off the dole and finding them jobs so not displaying the advert just seems absolutely ridiculous to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms Mamo, who runs Devonwood recruitment agency and employs eight people, placed her advert on the Thetford Jobcentre Plus website on January 21.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Campaign Against Political Correctness said: &#8220;This situation is absolutely ridiculous  &mdash;  of course people want reliable workers and of course employers should be able to ask for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they can&rsquo;t advertise for what they actually want then the system is broken. They won&rsquo;t be able to find workers who meet their criteria. In order to have decided that the word &#8216;reliable&rsquo; can&rsquo;t be used they must have put a great deal of thought and time into it.</p>
<p>&#8220;That time could be better spent getting the right people to apply for the right jobs  &mdash;  which is what this advert was trying to do in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions refused to comment on the phone call made to Nicole Mamo.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;We cannot comment about the phone call. I can confirm that we took the advert from the employer and put it onto our website. Every advert goes onto our website and onto the job points.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reliability is important to employers, as it is for Jobcentre Plus  &mdash;  and we welcome ads seeking reliable applicants.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Does being on time for work qualify as being reliable. So maybe unreliable is code for black. I have worked with many Black people who are good at their Jobs. But they seem to have troubler showing up to work on time. The fact is if you are caught punching in and then going out to park your car then you could be fired where I work.  Needless to say we have plenty of blacks working where I work. I even here jokes on talk radio about people being on BLACK TIME.</p>

		<p>Some of the lunacy that now comes out of England is so off-the-charts absurd, one has to seriously question if any of this is for real, or this is just a huge prank on us Yanks in the States!! Yet, we know today that this preposterous foolishness is all too real anymore - and if it weren&rsquo;t so dangerous and destructive it would be hysterical&hellip;but its anything but funny.</p>

		<p>When will we learn that discrimination is NEVER right!  I mean, if a dead man in Chicago can vote, why shouldn&rsquo;t he get a job as a street sweeper or bus driver?  Our society must get past it&rsquo;s petty prejudices.  Give a man (or woman) a chance!</p>

See deeper, folks.  The thugs demand the politically correct removal of &#8220;reliable&#8221; because the term is one of distinction. </p>
<p> The statists don&rsquo;t even want you to hear the word because it perpetuates in your mind that there are observable distinctions between reliable and unreliable.  The point of outlawing the word is to force people to stop thinking about distinctions and differences, and to fear what will happen to them if they mention words that carry the weight of hierarchy, superiority, inferiority, and undesirability. </p>
<p>Removing such speech is part of ethical reasoning and emphatic social justice, and all part of &#8220;passionately embracing a celebration of diversity&#8221;. </p>
<p>With liberal progressives, their tactics aren&rsquo;t as much the matter at hand as sending a message to the matter in your head by telegraphing to you what you are allowed to say or think without being harassed or financially destroyed.</p>
<p>Those who complained should be held accountable and report exactly how many &#8220;not reliable&#8221; employees they are paying to work reliably.<br>

		<p>Gee, maybe she should have said:  Wanted - domestic cleaner (list days/hours).  Requirements:  Must be at work promptly at 9:00 and leave promptly at 5:00 (or whatever the hours are).  1 hour for lunch, worker provides own lunch.  Worker provides own clothing.  I provide cleaning materials and gloves.  A contract listing the above plus negotiated wage must be signed by both proprietor and worker.  Please call (phone #) or reply to (email address).  All races and religions encouraged to apply.  In other words, CYA at all levels.</p>

		<p>I suppose future employment classifieds should include the following invitation:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&rsquo;re chronically late, unreliable, a convicted felon, prone to workplace violence and industrial sabotage, theft, and sexual harassment, WE WANT YOU!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Loopy? You bet. But it&rsquo;s just the logical conclusion of the numerous anti-discrimination laws that Western societies have cursed themselves with for the last half century or so.</p>
<p>There are good reasons historically for the right to free association. Once you start telling private citizens that they can&rsquo;t choose NOT to associate with other private citizens for whatever reason they wish, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before something like this happens. Maybe you think race doesn&rsquo;t constitute a rational basis for refusing to associate, but if race isn&rsquo;t a valid reason, then why not something else as well?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now reaching the bottom of the slippery slope, where standards of ANY kind are now forbidden. Surely things must turn around, because I don&rsquo;t see how they can get any worse.</p>

		<p>I have asked this question before, but nobody responded:<br>
Does anyone out there agree with me that white liberals are acting out of a genetically-based instinct to reduce their numbers (the Lemming Instinct)?<br>
Seriously, I believe that this a genetic trait that has surfaced in the last two generations. White liberals are unaware that they&rsquo;re acting on genetic instinct&hellip;a rare trait that may have never been present before. Oddly, Only whites have the gene. Oddly, only whites can civilize the world. Only whites can cocieve of altruism and population control. <br>
Genetic traits sometimes go horribly wrong, and the individual or population posessing them, dies.<br>
I say we can explain crazy white liberal multiculturalism and caving in, to genetics, not &#8220;Plots,&#8221; &#8220;Conspiracies&#8221; between liberals and neocons, etc.<br>
Anybody else agree?<br>
Or not, and why?<br>
How about a discussion, instead of more (Justified) venting<br>
 about the obvious.</p>

		<p>The leftist admitted that minorities are not reliable. This is the leftist speaking. The person who placed the advert did not mean to exclude minorities. </p>

		<p>I agree with #1.  Although many blacks are excellent workers, overall they have a rep for calling in and showing up late.  Ever heard of CPT?  That&rsquo;s &#8220;colored people&rsquo;s time&#8221;, a phrase made up by blacks themselves.  Obviously, the person(s) who balked at the adjective &#8220;reliable&#8221; thought inwardly that it&rsquo;s racially charged.</p>

		<p>kolblermak makes a good point. Leftists are creating Newspeak, as in Orwell&rsquo;s 1984 Oceania. I bet many of them would erase the word &ldquo;reliable&rdquo; from a dictionary if they had the power to do it. </p>

<p>Since you ask   &mdash;  - No!  I don&rsquo;t agree.  Not at all. I think you&rsquo;re barking up the wrong tree.</p>
<p>Where was this gene before, throughout history?   (Whites have had dense populations long before this; this isn&rsquo;t anything new.)</p>
<p>And why only whites?   Why not also Chinese, Japanese, etc.?</p>
<p>I could go on, but frankly I don&rsquo;t consider the question worth it.</p>

		<p>Using the same logic, they should have similarly struck the words &#8220;hard-working&#8221; from the advert.  Wouldn&rsquo;t want to discriminate against applicants who won&rsquo;t work hard.</p>
