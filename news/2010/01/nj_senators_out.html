			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Terry Hurlbut, National Examiner, January 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the wake of a devastating earthquake that by some accounts has utterly destroyed the infrastructure of Haiti, New Jersey&rsquo;s two Senators have taken prominent roles in trying to shape American policy toward Haiti and toward Haitian immigrants living in the US.</p>
<p>Senators Frank Lautenberg (D) and Robert Menendez (D) co-signed an open letter to President Obama yesterday afternoon, urging him to grant what is known as Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Haitians now resident (lawfully or not) in the United States. TPS is sometimes granted to immigrants from countries torn by war or natural disaster.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eleven other Senators, all Democrats, signed the letter. They include the entire New York and Massachusetts delegations and other prominent Democrats from New England, the Midwest, the Southwest, and Florida.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>32,000 Haitians live in New Jersey, as of the 2000 Census. {snip}<br>

		<p>I want to know whether temporary protective status will also apply to Haitians who come here after the earthquake. Or to Haitians who come here from the Bahamas illegally. We have quite a few Haitians where I work. I kind of expected that they would be rather agitated over what just happened to their homeland. To my surprise it was Business as usual. I think that empathy for ones countrymen is one of the things which make for a successful civilization. Haitians and Blacks in general do not seem to have any. But it seems neither do any of our own politicians with rare exceptions.</p>

		<p>Of all the Haitians in the U.S. (legally or illegally), a certain significant proportion have managed to achieve a level of prosperity that would permit them to tithe 10% of their earnings to a church. This group (whether in NJ or South Florida) would seem to to be the most indicated group to come to the aid of their countrymen either by monetary contributions or a contibution of missionary relief aid work in Haiti to assist in the clean up. </p>
<p>What are the odds that such would happen?</p>

<p>I gave a bit of money to Red Cross relief effort.  As pitiful as Haiti was before the quake, if it is not built back up, then you know where they will want to send the 10 million current Haitians in Haiti.  Better to spend a few bucks for them to rebuild themselves there than for them all to be &#8220;relocated&#8221; here.</p>

		<p>The Haitians here should be divided up and sent to those states whose senators signed the letter.</p>
<p>Then, afterwards, we should all sit back and watch their crime rates increase significantly.</p>

		<p>I knew this was coming. As tragic as this earthquake was, more large group of blacks are shown on TV hollering and screaming that someone is supposed to be helping them. It seems very few black ethnicities have become acquainted with the &#8216;help thyself&rsquo; philosophy. And soon mass evacuations of Haitians will be hitting the Florida shores and will never go home.</p>

I had another thought on this one.</p>
<p>How long will it be before this earthquake becomes a conspiracy to rid the black man from Haiti so the white man can take control of the country and all it&rsquo;s &#8216;natural resources&rsquo;?</p>

		<p>As soon as I heard that a devastating earthquake had struck the impoverished black nation of Haiti, I knew that politicians would be tripping over themselves to open the doors and invite them in. And not just liberal American politicians either - here in Canada, our &#8216;Conservative&rsquo; government is planning to do the same.</p>
<p>I detest anytime a disaster happens in the third world, be it war, natural forces, pestilence, starvation&hellip; you name it. Because it always amounts to the same thing&hellip; an excuse to bring those third-worlders into first-world (for now, anyhow) countries.</p>

		<p><b>Florida groups plan to airlift Haitian orphans to U.S.</b></p>
<p>In a move mirroring Operation Pedro Pan in the 1960s, Catholic Charities and other South Florida immigrant rights organizations are planning an ambitious effort to airlift possibly thousands of Haitian children left orphaned in the aftermath of Tuesday&rsquo;s horrific earthquake.<br>
&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the enormity of what happened in Haiti, a priority is to bring these orphaned children to the United States,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>This &#8220;Temporary&#8221; Protected Status has been granted for natural disasters and political reasons for other nations and they keep getting renewed, possibly forever.  It is part of the never ending immigration racket that afflicts the United States.</p>
<p>Expect an unending flood of Haitians (many of them with HIV/AIDS) to come to our shores because of this.  I find it pathetic this is the first action these senators think of, even before the relief aid.</p>

		<p>For decades, the US has given billions of US Tax Dollars to Haiti with nothing to show for it:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;From 1994 to 1999, U.S. taxpayers poured over $2.3 billion dollars into Haiti but relief officials are giving up in dismay at the meager results.</p>
<p>[Hilary] Clinton pledged more than $50 million in U.S. aid on top of an annual program exceeding $200 million for debt relief, food aid, counter-narcotics programs and job-creating road projects&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t be the type of people living there, could it, the ones whose ancestors killed off the Whites:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;The murder of the whites&hellip; began at Port-au-Prince in the first days of January [1805], but on the 17th and 18th of March they were finished off en masse. All, without exception, have been massacred, down to the very women and children. &hellip; A young mulatto named Fifi Pariset ranged the town like a madman searching the houses to kill the little children. Many of the men and women were hewn down by sappers, who hacked off their arms and smashed in their chests. Some were poniarded, others mutilated, others &rsquo;passed on the bayonet,&rsquo; others disemboweled with knives or sabers, still others stuck like pigs&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>So,  loud-mouthed politicians such as al franken will pledge massive amounts of other people&rsquo;s hard-earned money to this hell-hole so he can be portrayed as &#8216;compassionate&rsquo; by the controlled media while (CBS reports) &#8221; utter anarchy, gangs armed with machetes loot Port-Au-Prince.&#8221;</p>
<p>Considering that this population cannot take care of itself and is dependent on the largesse of the taxpayers of the US, the best plan would be to use the billions of US Taxpayer dollars to insert IUDs or NorPlant into adult females to curtail the population.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The United Nations says 60 percent of the population is sexually active by age 12 and the average number of births per woman is 4.8-the highest in the hemisphere. The population is expected to double to 16 million by 2030, and Haiti&rsquo;s overpopulation is ravaging the environment&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>So the US spends billions of dollars repairing the &#8216;infrastructure&rsquo; of Haiti only to have it destroyed and chaos return shortly thereafter.  </p>
<p>And yes, there will be loud demands for dirt-poor, illiterate, unskilled, burdensome Haitians to be admitted into the US as refugees  &mdash;  but not in the politicians&rsquo; community, in yours.</p>
<p>This won&rsquo;t be over for a LONG time and you can expect millions, if not billions of US taxpayer dollars to go missing.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>Mass immigration is a conscious policy of racial genocide against white America,  and the elites who run the program will use any excuse to further it.   The extermination of whites has become the raison d&rsquo;etre of the modern left -  not socialism or egalitarianism or an end to racism - but the final solution to the white problem.    The crooks at the top of the Conservative movement and the Republican Party are doomed to failure and dooming the nation to destruction by pretending they don&rsquo;t understand the above in order to get a chance to feed at the government\media trough.  </p>

<p>I understand the principle of giving money to Third World disaster relief in the hope that it&rsquo;ll keep the disaster&rsquo;s victims in their own countries, rather than &#8220;saving&#8221; them by bringing them to our countries. Because (as I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t need to tell anyone here) importing even more voodoo-worshipping pimps and pushers to prowl the streets of our cities is the last thing we need. </p>
<p>Call me hard-hearted, but in the case of the Haitian quake I have a hard time working up much concern of any sort. Haiti was founded 200 years ago on a genocide by African people against European people. The nation got its start by killing EVERY French man and woman on the island. A wholesale slaughter of people who look like me. </p>
<p>Yes, those murdered were slaveowners; and yes the Haitian slaves probably had been treated cruelly. But the fact remains that the &#8220;slave uprising&#8221; of 1805 was a successful black genocide of every white person they could get their hands on. (And 200 years later, there&rsquo;s little evidence they like us any better now than they did then.) </p>
<p>Rather than giving Haiti aid, maybe we should be demanding &#8220;holocaust reparations&#8221; from them. <br>

		<p>TPS will of course  be granted and then remain in place till the end of time as they will always say that Haiti has &#8220;not yet recovered&#8221; as Haitians have demonstrated an inability to build anything in the last 200 years and have shown a great willingness to kill people that try to help them. They will continue to overproduce without slowing down even an iota and continue shipping us their surplus population. </p>

		<p>I have been watching the BBC T/V news reports covering Haiti and am reminded of the link of the RHS of this page &#8220;Africa in our midst..Lessons from Katrina&#8221;. Considering that Haiti, as an independent country, is only a few years &#8216;younger&rsquo; than USA, it should be at least on a par with respect to law &amp; order, infrastructure and essential services. These international agencies sending aid and rescue personnel had better be surrounded and protected by some accompanying armed bodyguards to prevent the obvious and predictable from happening. Lets not kid ourselves, this is a black african nation and subject to black african behaviour and traditions so we should not expect anything more from them. Should the remaining Haitian &#8216;government&rsquo; object to foreign troops arriving in-country, then we should all turn round and leave, taking our stuff with us, or just leave it at the airport for local distribution. </p>

<p>I have to wonder:  With  8.7 million people in New Jersey, can 32,000 Haitians influence the policies of that state?   And how many of them can even vote?</p>
<p>I have nothing against aiding Haitians IN HAITI. But any aid given should be THERE.  No special status should be granted to Haitians in the USA, nor should any be brought here.  This tragedy should not be used as an opportunity to further increase immigration.  But we know it will be.</p>

 <br>
Then, all these tens of thousands of new &#8220;Haitian-Americans&#8221; will be sent, not to areas already diverse, but deliberately to the most conservative, lily-white areas left.<br>
 <br>
THEN, the Haitian immigrants will prove almost impossible to assimilate and cause grave social-ills. Whoever complains will be silenced by charges of racism and extremism.<br>
 <br>
AT LAST, the new &#8220;Haitian-Americans&#8221; will become reliable Democratic voters by over 90%. By then, our rulers will have moved on to countless more crises around the world, which they&rsquo;ll also make our permanent problems.</p>

		<p>Fellow Amrenners, this is the first time, at least in my memory, that an earthquake has hit a black nation. I don&rsquo;t recall any earthquakes south of Algeria, or Madagascar. And yet, the results were predictable. There were looters in Haiti, who then tried to blend in with people who were clutching their belongings.</p>
<p>Like everyone else here, this is just the excuse the Obama regime needs to &#8220;resettle&#8221; thousands, if not millions, of Haitians here.</p>

Now, the black taxpayer gets to help his &ldquo;bro&rdquo; when they come to the shores of Florida in droves&hellip;and, oh yes, they will come. As more uneducated, &ldquo;proud&rdquo; illiterates hit our shores, once again, I hope our &ldquo;African American&rdquo; citizens rise up to help their brothers in need. Have you ever seen a black help a black without an incentive? No racism, just observation</b></p>
<p>The ironic thing is it&rsquo;s always stupid whites that try to be nice and help blacks, yet blacks not only don&rsquo;t help their own but they are all about hating whites and getting revenge on us.  I say screw em&rsquo; and let them go by the wayside.</p>

		<p>Brace yourselves boys,here they come.Back when I was working(I&rsquo;m a victim of Obamanomics) I had the great fortune to work with a lot of Hatians and now I know why their country is the poorest in the world.The Clinton admin. pumped billions of American dollars into their country,and what did it accomplish? I&rsquo;m wondering how long it will take for the Haitians to blame racism for not getting &#8220;help&#8221; to them quickly enough. It has already been the focus of the libs who use racism as being the main reason it&rsquo;s the poorest nation in the world. With self rule comes self responsibility hard work and vision for a descent lifestyle for your people. My grandfather used to say &#8220;Pull yourself up by your bootstraps and get to work.&#8221; It&rsquo;s as if you have an entire country that has become a wellfare state,dependant on the rest of the world for their very survival.Everyone needs help sometime.How can that possibly work in the long term? It can&rsquo;t. Teach your children well. </p>

		<p>3 observations:</p>
<p>* The Haitians in the U.S. are here to stay. No sense is discussing that.</p>
<p>* It will be intersting the see how the U.S. handles all the boat people. But I have a guess.</p>
<p>* Even if all the aid the U.S. gives Haiti goes to the right people that only solves the problem for a few days. Haiti is probably going to be another Puerto Rico (a giant welfare state). </p>

		<p>The residents of Haiti are proving to be the Carribean equivalent of the N.O. Katrina curbsitters. They are demanding that the white folks help them. This will be a replay of the Superdome fiasco. We will be subjected to a barrage of MSN reports on the courage and resourcefulness of the Haitians, but a closer examination will reveal the typical black response to emergencies.</p>

		<p>Haiti was a basket case before the earthquake, and will continue to be so after.  Check back again after 40 years of throwing billions of dollars into this waste land and strain your eyes for any noticeable improvements.  This is a textbook example of the inability of blacks to sustain a civilization, at the face of natural disaster and without. Initiative, self-determination and leadership are nil; the last time I checked the news, people were looting and chanting in the streets - instead of rebuilding.  And those ninnies in New Jersey want to import this disaster?</p>

		<p>Watching CNN, yesterday, I learned that Barack Obama, or the Mulatto Messiah, as many now call him, wants to donate 100 millions of dollars to help rebuild Haïti.</p>
<p>That sounds crazy to me, since his own country has been borrowed billions from other countries, such as China.</p>
<p>Barack&rsquo;s job is to take care of American problems with American money, right? I&rsquo;m not saying that no help at all should be offered to the Haïtians, but 100 million dollars is probably more than the US should spend, right now.</p>
<p>Or&hellip; could this have anything to do with the fact that the Haïtians are Black? I mean, what would Handsome Barack do, if such a catastrophe happened in a place like say, Iceland, for instance?</p>

		<p>What should be noted is the fact that Haitians rival Somalians as the laziest of all immigrants. Literally 98 out of 100 will not work, do not want to work. People aren&rsquo;t aware that Haitians could stroll into the Dominican Republic to get out of their hell-hole, but in the Dominican, they&rsquo;d have to work, as in the sugar cane fields. They rather risk life and death trying to get to the US and get on welfare. This earthquake is most likely going to be a Godsend for lazy Haitians to easily get to the US and sponge off of us, and it will prove to be a Godsend for the anti-white haters running this country as they now have an easy way to haul in thousands upon thousands of low IQ, violent non-whites to send to the whitest area they can find. </p>

		<p>Compare the reactions and results between this earthquake and the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan.  See the civilized population of Japan help each other and quickly rebuild their city.  Their earthquake was compared to the 1923 quake that hit Tokyo and parts of the Kanto Plain in magnitude.  Now watch on TV the good people of Haiti as they respond to their quake.  TV shows people demanding the USA do more, complaining about the relief rations they have to eat, and the thugs roaming the streets.  What a shame and disgrace to watch.</p>

		<p>  Well, we&rsquo;re all angry over our government&rsquo;s response, and cynical about the outcomes, long as well as short term. And our vexation is wholly justified. I wonder how many of us will have the audacity to write our congresscritters and say &#8220;Just send a few million in aid and let the rest of the world do their share. And don&rsquo;t let ANY more in. Deport the 2 million that are already here illegally.&#8221;  Water off a duck&rsquo;s back, I realize, but it&rsquo;s time to start telling them how we really feel. Sensitivity and tact have availed us nothing. We might as well let them know how  we really feel. Perhaps for some it might be a tiny ray of light.</p>

<p>The quake 7.0 quake was centered 14 miles West from city center Port au Prince. It was an exceptionally shallow quake centered only 6 miles beneath the pavement surface. The homes in Haiti are built to withstand Hurricanes and feature tight block construction - as opposed to homes built using flexible wood to withstand earthquakes in places such as Japan. <br>

______________________</p>
<p>Having seen the Dominican Republic (and once was enough), I can tell you that it is only &#8220;civilized&#8221; by contrast with its neighbor, Haiti.  However, by contrast with its other neighbor, Puerto Rico, it is really quite primitive. Everything being relative.  </p>
<p>Dominicans struggle to get to Puerto Rico, just as Haitians connive and strive to get into the Dom. Rep. <br>
No doubt Haitians think the DR is paradise.</p>
<p>Oh, and as for the houses and buildings in Haiti, from what I have been reading, there is NO BUILDING CODE in Haiti. You can just build anything you want, any way you want. This explains why so much of it fell down.  Typical third world.</p>
