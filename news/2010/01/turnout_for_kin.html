			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Justin Berton, San Francisco Chronicle, January 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It didn&rsquo;t feel much like a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday in San Francisco to Steve Zeltzer, a local film producer who visited the Yerba Buena Gardens memorial in honor of the slain civil rights leader Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a disgrace,&#8221; Zeltzer said as he looked around and saw just a few dozen people studying large photographs of King while listening to broadcasts of his &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;In San Francisco there should be 100,000 people marching in the streets, talking about the things MLK stood for: equality, democracy, freedom,&#8221; Zeltzer said. &#8220;All these things are still relevant today, maybe more than ever. So where is everybody?&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeltzer was among those who, for two decades, marched on Market Street and gathered at Civic Center rallies on the King holiday. But this year, many were left to seek out smaller celebrations after the group that organized the city&rsquo;s largest event disbanded in December.</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s chairman, the Rev. Cecil Williams, cited dwindling crowds and said it was time to allow a new generation of civil rights activists to plan such celebrations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bad weather may have contributed to a lower turnout on the annual Freedom Train ride from San Jose to San Francisco, said Chuck Herndon, a Caltrain train master.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Amy Wagner, a San Jose resident, rode the Freedom Train for the first time along with a group of three adults and 11 children, ages 1 through 10.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the children are learning about Dr. King in school right now,&#8221; Wagner said. &#8220;What better way to teach history and King&rsquo;s legacy?&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the ride&rsquo;s organizer, the 51-mile journey from San Jose to San Francisco is the same distance King marched in 1965 from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. Riders sang freedom songs and recited passages from King&rsquo;s speeches as they traveled into the city.</p>

		<p>This year, the King holiday was a non-event.</p>
<p>I noticed that I didn&rsquo;t see one local station run a service announcement proclaiming MLK day.</p>
<p>The Buffalo News ran a story with a picture showing 5 &#8216;African&rsquo; dancers on a stage at Kleinhands Music Hall which is a major cultural venue for the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra. There was no information given on the size of the crowd and the people they interviewed were the black old guard who were parroting the line about how MLK is as relevant today as ever etc&hellip;</p>
<p>The comment section of the Buffalo News had a total of 26 posts including two of mine asking how many people attended.</p>
<p>They have their black President and few real issues to rally around anymore.</p>

<p>Obviously, this kooky guy is white.  Don&rsquo;t you get the impression that it&rsquo;s awfully strange for a white to be so fixated on something that has no direct bearing on himself or his race?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering just what some hard psycho analysis would reveal about this guy.  The PC crowd will applaud his love of diversity, but isn&rsquo;t his peculiar attitude more in line with someone who is just a bit off?  I think &#8220;Bats in the belfry&#8221; was the old saying to describe him.</p>

<p>How horrible, this is like a Kwanzaa without prostitutes! </p>
<p>To be frank, I look forward to the Martin Loony King &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; mostly because I usually catch a few radio interviews with Jared Taylor or other AR staff, since I get it off. Unfortunately, this was not in the works this year; so, I celebrated it by sleeping in and having a good luncheon at a local Mongolian BBQ with a few friends. Either way, it always goes well for me.</p>
<p>Perhaps, they should declare a MLK month and give me that off too.<br>

		<p>The turnout for MLK Day events in St. Louis was low.  I noticed on TV that, at the rally, a young black man, probably no older than 12, yelled into the microphone, &#8220;free at last, free at last, thank God almighty free at last!&#8221;  I can see where he&rsquo;s coming from.  He was born way back in the olden days of slavery, the late 1990s.  I&rsquo;m sure his back is scarred from the slaver&rsquo;s whip.</p>

		<p>I guess it&rsquo;s good in a way that Obama got elected to help boost black self-esteem.  It was getting downright embarrassing every February (black history month) to witness black &#8220;achievement&#8221; being posted on a Federal bulletin board.  Same old people every year; MLK, Rosa Parks, George Washington Carver, etc, etc. etc.  What is so glaringly noticeable is that besides Colin Powell or Condoleeza Rice, almost all of them are antiquated figures from America&rsquo;s past; &#8220;heroes&#8221; overcoming some kind of victimization.  Before Obama there was nothing new, nothing modern other than a few token appointments by a sitting President.  Not that Obama has done anything but he will be remembered far longer in history than these other people.  When you actually start to think about what this &#8220;civil rights&#8221; leader did it comes down to riding around on a bus and regurgitating someone&rsquo;s purloined speeches.  It seems so ludicrous.</p>

		<p>To honor MLK blacks would have to live what he publicly preached.  Most blacks do not believe in judging a man by the content of his character.  Most blacks do not believe in non-violence.  He got them access to white schools, neighborhoods and women.  Battle won, no need to dwell on any moral precepts.<br>

		<p>I was actually in New York City Monday - I saw absolutely NO evidence that this was any kind of &#8220;holiday&#8221; at all. Heck, even the traffic was basically as thick as usual. Blacks appeared every bit as indifferent to it as anyone else. It was lovely&hellip;  </p>

<p>This was my exact observation too. Traffic even seemed to be very light where I am at, but still, nothing of any real measure occurring. Folks at work all showed up and were totally indifferent to the day.</p>
<p>The news even seemed to downplay the day, the event, etc.</p>

I&rsquo;ll give you lovely! Working on a NATO camp with the Spanish, Italian and Slovenian Armies&hellip;.there are NO BLACKS present with any of these units=LOVELY! The U.S. Military generally resembles a Congolese army and overall, is about as effective.</p>

		<p>I just enjoy the day off. I call it by &#8216;fill in the blank with whatever White historical figure I can think of at the moment day&rsquo;. One year it might be &#8220;Lee/Jackson Day&#8221;, on another it is &#8220;Charles Martel Day&#8221;, or &#8220;Scipio Africanus Day&#8221;, etc. </p>
<p>This year it was &#8220;Rorke&rsquo;s Drift Day&#8221; since  &#8220;Chard/Bromhead&#8221; day is too obscure.</p>

		<p>Get real. Compared to BHO, Michael King is nobody. Was MLK ever elected to public office? No! Nobel Peace prize? BHO has one. When the Hispanics or Chinese take over, they won&rsquo;t care for MLK.</p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t hear a whole lot about MLK either this week. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because people are beginning to realize that his &#8220;dream&#8221; of racial harmony is just that - a dream.</p>

		<p>MLK Day is NEVER a non-issue in Atlanta. The joyous festivities [sarcasm] begin a week before the actual day, then proceeds on until it merges into the preface for the all-glorious February - Black History Month. A full month of every local television station interspersing public service announcements into their broadcasting every few minutes about blacks who did something; ANYTHING to get noticed. It&rsquo;s enough to gag a maggot.</p>

		<p>Here in NYC the MLK holiday appears to have jumped the shark, like Kwaanza.</p>
<p>It may be due to the passage of time; Americans have less interest in the Civil Rights Era just as there&rsquo;s been a decline of interest in the Civil War, the two World Wars, the Colonial Era, etc.</p>

		<p>The turnout was probably low because there were fewer White liberals this year organizing the festivities for the blacks.  Perhaps they are tired of &#8220;the dream&#8221; and want to move on to something else or maybe they&rsquo;re keeping a low key because the American public is realizing that these people have communist affiliations.  If it weren&rsquo;t for White liberals pushing this for blacks MLK would quickly fade into obscurity.  I can remember 25 years ago when alot of black kids didn&rsquo;t know who he was.  </p>

		<p>Apparently MLK has been forgotten (which is a good thing), if he&rsquo;s remembered here as &#8220;Michael&#8221; King.  And the song is &#8220;Men of Harlech,&#8221; for the sake of accurary to those of Welsh descent.</p>

Zulu is a fine film. It is sad that movies like this can not be made anymore since the movie industry does not have to pay attention to a White audience. If a WN film industry ever gets off the ground it would be nice to see a few historical films from the White POV. </p>

<p>All those progressives in San Francisco moved there to get away from black people.  What does that idiot think?  I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll all turn out for Harvey Milk day though.</p>
<p>Since it stopped being Washington&rsquo;s birthday, it stopped being my holiday.  MLK means nothing more to me than does some obscure saint&rsquo;s day mean to a calvinist.</p>
