<h1>&#8216;Too White&rsquo; Berkeley Science Labs May Be Cut</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Roger Hedgecock, Human Events, January 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Berkeley (CA) Board of Education will consider, at its February 3 meeting, whether or not to cancel before and after school Science Labs for Advanced Placement Science classes at Berkeley High School because the classes are attended largely by white students. The proposal is aimed at addressing &#8220;Berkeley&rsquo;s dismal racial achievement gap&#8221;</p>
<p>According to published reports, the proposal to cancel the science labs and re-allocate the money for five teaching positions to an unspecified program of &#8220;equity grants&#8221; to help struggling &#8220;minority&#8221; students comes from Berkeley High School Principal Jim Slemp and the school&rsquo;s Governance Council.</p>
<p>Berkeley Unified School District Superintendent William Huyett said the unspecified new programs could include  &#8220;a course on supporting kids&rsquo; scholarship  &mdash;  note-taking skills, how to study  &mdash;  and helps them apply those things to the courses they are taking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huyett, a former AP Physics teacher himself, has been quoted as believing that moving the lab classes from before and after school to inside the school day would improve participation in the AP classes by &#8220;minority&#8221; students. Huyett admits that limiting labs to the school day would decrease the overall number of lab classes available to students.  The reason lab classes were scheduled before and after school in the first place was the limited number of labs on campus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Berkeley&rsquo;s AP Science courses are an outstanding success.  In a time when we are constantly reminded of the need for American students to get better at Physics, Biology, and Chemistry, 82% of Berkeley&rsquo;s AP chemistry students passed the national exam. The national passing rate is 55.2%.</p>
<p>Mardi Sicular-Mertens, a science teacher at Berkeley High School for 24 years, recently told the school board that her AP classes include 17.5% African-American and 13.9% Latino students. Apparently, that&rsquo;s not enough. Chemistry teacher Aaron Glimme said that &#8220;there is a clear difference by race as to who shows up to the lab classes.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, the AP classes are open to all students, but because &#8220;minority&#8221; students don&rsquo;t &#8220;show up&#8221; to these lab classes in the same percentage as the percentage of &#8220;minority&#8221; students attending Berkeley High overall, the classes must be cancelled to close the &#8220;dismal racial achievement gap.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Proponents of the class cuts cite the need to address the &#8220;achievement gap.&#8221; According to the California Department of Education, while white students at BHS are 90% proficient in English, only 30.8% of African-American students are. While white students are 87.1% proficient in Math, only 31.3% of African-American students are.</p>

		<p>Yet, the liberals all push for longer school days.  These labs were indicative of a longer school day for those who took them, so what&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p>Note-taking and studying skills ought to be mastered before one enters high school.  If you don&rsquo;t know it by the age of 14, then you don&rsquo;t deserve extra resources thrown at you, especially if they will be taken away from smart students.  </p>

		<p>If the minority students don&rsquo;t get smarter, the white students must get dumber. It would be unfair otherwise. Notice the tone of the author. He must not realize he is in the land of progressives. If he thinks this is outrageous, tell him to go visit a WWII vet in Detroit who has lived the last 40 years of his life in constant terror and fear from the same people he helped save from global extermination. His house will be easy to find. It will be the one that is well maintained with the American flag out front and the 90 year old man sitting on the porch, staring out in disbelief and disgust. Once he was too loyal to leave. As the demographics changed and housing prices fell he couldn&rsquo;t afford to leave. Even if he could, many of his friends couldn&rsquo;t, as they needed each other more than ever. Too proud to complain or burden their children, most of them are already gone, loyal to the end.  </p>

		<p>So their favorite people are failing, and all liberals can think of doing is making all the successful, hard-working people FAIL TOO!<br>
This is because liberals are obsessed with equality of outcome.</p>
<p>If the results are unequal, it must be because the game is unfair, not because one of the players is not playing well! <br>

		<p>In the years to come, this sort of thing will happen more and more as Blacks and Hispanics replace Europeans in the USA.  </p>
<p>Already, our local school distric spends 90 times MORE money on the lowest-achieving (D- and F-grade-achieving) students, than on Gifted Students (3.9-4.0 GPA).  </p>
<p>We know that our economy and standard of living depend on constant scientific/technical breakthroughs.  Yet, we spend only 1% of our K-8 grade funding on the very, very smart kids (of all races) who could, if given the training, become our next generation of scientists.  </p>
<p>MASSIVE amounts of money are spent on Blacks and Hispanics.  The results?  Average reading, science, and Math scores for H.S.-graduating Blacks and Hispanics have now risen to about 8th to 10th grade White level.    </p>

<p>My late father, who was a successful businessman for 35 years, once told me: &#8220;Throwing all the money in the world at a problem isn&rsquo;t going to fix it if there&rsquo;s no solution to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the &#8220;Brown v. Board of Education&#8221;, &#8220;Great Society&#8221; and &#8220;Affirmative Action&#8221; programs on earth are not going to turn a people genetically preordained to be dullards into a race of scientists, musicians and artists.  Leftist Whites, however, are just too dopey and delusional to grasp that fact.</p>

		<p>This is actually a great thing! The nice white liberals will have to live with the same type of laws they usually foist on the poor and working class rednecks. There have to be a few whites living in Berkeley who are not brain dead. If there are, they will no doubt wake up to the reality of anti-white racism. If not, they are beyond saving anyway and deserve to have their kids discriminated against even more.</p>
<p>But what about the Asians? Unlike whites, they usually fight for their kids. Asians are no doubt overrepresented in the district science classes. Strange that they are not speaking up (but perhaps they are a lower percentage that I would have thought).</p>

		<p>This proves what I have long suspected, that since black students can&rsquo;t compete academically with white students, the white students are purposely being &#8220;dumbed down&#8221; so as not to draw attention to the fact that their ARE differences in the learning abilities of whites and blacks.</p>

<p>Definitely a lot of stupid, ignorant white people in this world. Whites are already the world&rsquo;s minority, yet are the only race of people on this planet actively involved in their own extinction. But, as whites go, so goes the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Yeah, no kidding.  Even agencies such as NASA are under tremendous pressure to &#8216;reflect diversity&rsquo; and hire more woefully inadequate blacks and hispanics rocket scientists to displace Whites.  But the government has a plan B ready to go to save face  &mdash;  they don&rsquo;t want to sink billions of dollars into  space missions doomed to failure due to a dearth of White aeronautical and mechanical engineers, physicists and planetary scientists.</p>
<p> It seems the government knows black and hispanics are not capable of carrying on White achievement in space and in response is redirecting NASA&rsquo;s mission:</p>
<p>&hellip;President Obama is redefining the mission of NASA &hellip; away from space and aeronautics and toward the monitoring of global warming: &#8216;When the White House releases his budget proposal Monday, there will be no money for the Constellation program that was supposed to return humans to the moon by 2020. The troubled and expensive Ares I rocket that was to replace the space shuttle to ferry humans to space will be gone, along with money for its bigger brother, the Ares V cargo rocket that was to launch the fuel and supplies needed to take humans back to the moon. &hellip; </p>
<p>In the meantime, the White House will direct NASA to concentrate on Earth-science projects   &mdash;   principally, researching and monitoring climate change&hellip;&#8221; </p>

<p>M. Taylor was not wrong when he stated that &#8220;We don&rsquo;t go looking in Mexico for rocket scientists!&#8221;</p>
<p>Come to think of it:  Did Stephen Hawking ever find &#8216;Africa&rsquo;s answer to Einstein?&rsquo;<br>
Said he:  &ldquo;The world of science needs Africa&rsquo;s brilliant talents and I look forward to meeting prospective young Einsteins from Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without White science and engineering, the American space program is finis.</p>

<p>I was thinking the same thing. I lived in the Bay Area for a couple of years-1989-1991, and there was a significant Asian population in the region. I&rsquo;m sure that Berkeley High has many Asian students. <br>

<p>All to true, and soon all of the WWII veterans will have passed and few will care, I DO! I am also a combat veteran of the Viet-Nam war (and a few others:) and I read in a VA news paper that the VietNam veterans are dying at a much faster rate than even the WWII vets did with the exception of those that fought in the Pacific. The U.S. is hardly a country worth fighting for anymore but I still don&rsquo;t want the muslims and blacks to have it.</p>

<p>The so called intellects at Berkeley need to realize that it is not Berkeley&rsquo;s dismal racial achievement gap. It is a black racial achievement gap. Years of coming up with clever solutions to this problem and throwing money at it hasn&rsquo;t made blacks any smarter.</p>

<p>Even if blacks do participate more, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they will learn more. They will leave the lab knowing just as much as when they walked into it.<br>

		<p>This budget shortfalls this year for universities will suffer even greater losses of funding, which is good news, since they need to get back to the bare necessities of regular subjects and cut out all the nonsense courses, like black and women&rsquo;s studies.</p>
<p>If the Board of Education at Berkley thinks they&rsquo;re going to be able to cut valuable programs because they&rsquo;re too white, wait until their budget shortfall is known this year, next year, the one after, etc.  They will be cutting then, because the programs that are nonsensical and costing them dearly are too black.</p>
<p>Schooling from the ground up all over the country has devolved into a morass of nonsense and political correctness to the point where social engineering, rather than learning, has become the top priority. Thankfully, that is in the process of change right now, and it delights me no end to see these bigotted academics weep hysterically everytime they realize they&rsquo;re going to have to cut back drastically on their nonsense subjects.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a shame if they had to cut their pro-black sports teams, thereby reducing dum dum enrollment to insignificant levels?</p>
<p>Schhols throughout the country are affected.  Here&rsquo;s just the first few from a Google search.  I&rsquo;m illustrating them to give an example of the depth and extent of financial woes academia is enduring.  It&rsquo;s going to get worse:</p>

Universities Cut Teams as They Trim Their Budgets<br>
By Ken Belson<br>
THE NEW YORK TIMES<br>
May 5, 2009<br>
After three decades of steady growth in the number of teams and student-athletes, colleges and universities large and small, private and public, east and west, are slashing millions of dollars from their sports budgets.</p>
<p>Colleges have dismissed athletic staff, reduced hours for pools and practice courts, and increased equipment and facility fees. Some have also cut the size of their travel squads, eliminated trips requiring air travel and done away with housing teams in hotels the night before home games.</p>

<p>this really makes the movement feel justified, this is a clear case of us being hindered and brought down by the presence of nonwhites. Its completely reasonable of us to respond to this with resistance and hostility.</p>

<p>But even better than that will be the kindness we show to the defeated foes. All others in the world would simply exterminate their defeated enemies, but Americans aren&rsquo;t like the rest of humanity. We will help our former enemies.</p>

		<p>The incredible stupidity of this just amazes me.  Blacks and Latinos ARE NOT interested in science, math, or anything having to do with either of the aforementioned.  It isn&rsquo;t their bag, so to speak.  And so Berkeley is brilliantly going to punish the students who ARE interested by shutting down the labs so NO ONE can participate?  Wow, what brilliance - perhaps the people that made this decision are as well-educated and intelligent as the people they propose to help by this action&hellip;</p>

<p>But they don&rsquo;t cut the black sports teams. They cut wrestling, volleyball, cross country, tennis, baseball and other sports that are 95% white.</p>

		<p>One way to curb this nonsense is to try and stop the renewal of the infamous No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB).  The NCLB&rsquo;s emphasis is outcome based objectives for every racial and ethnic group in the public school systems.  Therefore, many schools will not fund advanced work for the good students.  Instead, they will pour endless funds into programs for poor performing, &#8220;minority&#8221; students.</p>
<p>If &#8220;minority&#8221; students become a majority in many school systems it will result in the United States progressively becoming a nation of dummies.  The Chinese must be laughing themselves silly watching us destroy our public education system for groups that have always been, and will always be essentially dysfunctional.</p>

		<p>First off I am a product of our public education system! My writing skills stink! If minority students cannot keep up throw them out! I simply cannot believe that they will cut a program that is open to ALL. Lets cut BLACKSKETBALL and FOOTBALL because whites are under represented in that. I am FED UP</p>

I see blacks here getting preferential treatment often but if I dare question it I am a racist.  Same at Cornell, no, even worse at Cornell, trust me.</p>

		<p>  I was never particularly good at Chemistry or Physics. However, I never advocated closing down the Labs because of my deficiencies. Multiculturalism means we dumb down to the lowest common denominator so that minority feelings are not hurt. How can we have a competitive country with this philosophy?</p>

		<p>My late father, who was a successful businessman for 35 years, once told me: &ldquo;Throwing all the money in the world at a problem isn&rsquo;t going to fix it if there&rsquo;s no solution to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of us clever AR posters pointed out that &#8220;money won&rsquo;t solve the problem if money ISN&rsquo;T the problem&#8221;</p>

		<p>To Sardonicus (re post # 27):</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m missing something, but exactly what kind of global competition are we speaking of - who will be the first to sell cheeseburgers to the Maldives, or who will be the first to broadcast &#8220;American Idol&#8221; to North Korea?</p>
<p>All this howl about &#8220;global competition&#8221; is giving me a headache. Didn&rsquo;t we compete against the Soviets in matters of space exploration, nuclear weapons supremacy, exporting economic systems to Third World backwater countries, and to see who won the most Olympic medals? Didn&rsquo;t we win the Cold War?</p>
<p>Why are we concerned about &#8220;competing&#8221; against other nations, when we won&rsquo;t allow educational and academic competition among students in our own country? Where is it written that Caucasians, Asians, blacks and mestizos must be equal in grade point average, in every school and in every subject?</p>
<p>Could you imagine some judge, or a panel of judges decreeing that a Chihuahua&rsquo;s guard dog abilities must be the same as a Rottweiler&rsquo;s? Or that the value of gold must be equal to the value of roentgenium? That would be preposterous.</p>
<p>You CANNOT have equality and diversity. The two are mutually exclusive.</p>

		<p>Why put money into teaching Blacks and Hispanics how to sit in class and take notes, when the same amount of money put into teaching Whites will give me scientists and engineers?  What a poor return on an investment.</p>
