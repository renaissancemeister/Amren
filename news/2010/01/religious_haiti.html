<h1>Religious Haitians See Hand of God in Earthquake</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michelle Faul, Washington Post, January 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Deeply religious Haitians see the hand of God in the destruction of Biblical proportions visited on their benighted country. The quake, religious leaders said Sunday, is evidence that He wants change.</p>
<p>Exactly what change He wants depends on the faith: Some Christians say it&rsquo;s a sign that Haitians must deepen their faith, while some Voodoo followers see God&rsquo;s judgment on corruption among the country&rsquo;s mostly light-skinned elite.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some followers of Voodoo, practised alongside Roman Catholicism by the vast majority of Haitians, said the devastation of key symbols of power was punishment for corrupt leaders who have allowed the mostly light-skinned elite to enrich themselves while the black majority suffers.</p>
<p>&#8220;If all of a sudden, in 15 seconds, 20 seconds, all the physical representations of corruption are destroyed, it gives you pause for thought,&#8221; said Richard Morse, a renowned Haitian-American musician whose mother was a singer and revered Voodoo priestess. &#8220;The Justice Ministry: down. The National Palace: down. The United Nations headquarters: down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unharmed by the quake was the famed bronze statue, &#8220;Le Maron Inconnu&#8221;  &mdash;  &#8220;the Unknown Escaped Slave&#8221;  &mdash;  noted Morse, who owns the Oloffson Hotel featured in Graham Greene&rsquo;s novel &#8220;The Comedians.&#8221;</p>
<p>The destruction of every major Catholic church in the capital, including the 81-year-old cathedral, also was a sign, he said: &#8220;When there is all this corruption going on, whose role is it in society to speak out? Isn&rsquo;t the Church supposed to say something?&#8221;</p>
<p>Most Haitians are Christian  &mdash;  largely Catholic with a small but growing number of Protestants. But most also practice Voodoo, which along with Catholicism is an official state religion.</p>

		<p>Funny but not surprising that these Haitians fail to see the &#8220;hand of God&#8221; in the deaths of so many of their own countrymen. After all, with all the looting, raping and pillaging now going on in Haiti, there is obviously a good bit of corruption among their own people. This is not even to mention the rampant overbreeding in the small island nation that led to the concentrated population that magnified the effects of this disaster.</p>
<p>The lessons taken from this disaster by the Haitians are in fact very selective all around. It&rsquo;s seen as a blow against Catholicism, but not against voodoo, which also failed to protect them. As for the corrupt government, I&rsquo;m a believer in the truism that people generally tend to get the kind of government that they deserve.</p>

I wonder if the Haitians will receive as much scorn as Pat Robertson did when he said the exact same thing.</p>

		<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re right.  The thing is, the Haitians have to be willing to organize and FIGHT for their freedom, just as the U.S. patriots did in the Revolutionary War.  And even if they were willing to do that, what&rsquo;s left to fight FOR???</p>

		<p>Yeah, well if it&rsquo;s not global warming it&rsquo;s got to be racism.</p>
<p>I believe the Canadians are keen to take in the whole lot&hellip;&hellip;.. go for it Canada, I&rsquo;m convinced they&rsquo;ll assimilate beautifully. Imagine that you can get about 8 million all in one go.</p>

		<p>So who&rsquo;s right   &mdash;   Pat Robertson, when he says Haitians are being punished for making a deal with the devil when they kicked out the French (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5TE99sAbwM) or the Voodoo practitioners who are saying God is punishing the light skinned blacks?</p>
<p>Me, I vote for none of these nutcases.  I suspect it had more to do with stresses being released along a major fault line.<br>

		<p>   For those believers in the great liberal dream that miscegenation will eliminate racism, Haiti offers a stern rebuttal.  In Haiti a light skinned mulatto elite rules over the darker skinned majority   &mdash;  just as it does throughout most of the Caribbean. A continuum of color exists with the lighter skinned on top and the darker on the bottom. These mulatto elites carefully guard their generic heritage and exploit the poorer, darker classes. Even without whites, colorism/racism exists among blacks. </p>

		<p>Devout trust that the Almighty labors yet in silence, in stillness after the last block falls.  But those who have lived as long as I, long enough to hear radicals now clamor for reinstatement of the draft, to watch hacks who shouted the death of Liuzzo daily suppress dark slaughter of pale innocence with nary a whisper, those in their aged, jaded bones know that God is not aworkin&rsquo; in Haiti.</p>

		<p>Apparently the Haitians haven&rsquo;t checked in with Danny Glover. He claimed the earthquake was punishment caused by the earth for the lack of co-operation and failure to make &#8216;green&rsquo; changes at the Global Warming Summit.  </p>

		<p>Why is it that the blacker you are (with more African genes), the poorer you are and lower you are on the totem pole of a society? In the Caribbean mulatoes rule over blacks, in Guyana Asian Indians rule over blacks, in Madagascar Malay-black mixes rule over pure blacks, in Sudan Arab-black mixes rule over pure blacks. In multicultural Brazil blacks are at the bottom, in South Africa the black majority is poorer than the Whites, Coloureds and Asians and in India/Pakistan the tiny Siddi blacks (who are descendants of black slaves) are the poorest of the poor. After all this it is very surprising that any non-black woman would want to have children with black men and thus curse their own coming descendants to a lower status in society.</p>

		<p>From what I read, only about 5% of Haitians ever vote.  If they want to get rid of their mulatto overlords, why don&rsquo;t they go to the polls and do so?  Then they can be like South Africa! </p>

		<p>The mentality cracks me up to no end!! It had to be the light-skinned ruling class (does that even exist in Haiti?)that had this coming to them. The only problem is, voodoo priests, MOST if not ALL of those killed were darker than African type blacks on the island!!! How moronic can you get. Please&hellip; somebody help these people out. Send them over to Afghanistan or Pakistan. I&rsquo;m sure their witchcraft and black magic would be tolerated in the stronghold of hardcore Muslim war territories. When one day, whites are a figment of the planet&rsquo;s imagination and third worlders are running around wanting their problems fixed, they won&rsquo;t be too far behind because they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to blame anybody and their left-leaning white liberals won&rsquo;t be around to go to bat for them. I Rue the day! </p>

		<p>Danny Glover must be made to understand that earthquakes are geophysical phenomena, like volcanoes, rockslides and geysers. They are not meteorological phenomena like tornadoes, blizzards and hailstorms. There is no &#8220;earthquake season&#8221; like there is a &#8220;hurricane season&#8221;.</p>
