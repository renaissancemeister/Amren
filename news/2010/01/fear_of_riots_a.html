			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lara Marlowe, Irish Times (Dublin), January 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There are heartbreaking scenes amid the picnic tables and golf tees of a former haven for elites</p>
<p>US ARMY specialist Juan Valencia stood on the hillside above the Haitian capital, watching the teeming camp below with binoculars. &#8220;I&rsquo;m just making sure they don&rsquo;t have any weapons. They&rsquo;re allowed to have weapons, but not within range of our guys,&#8221; said the spotter for the 82nd Airborne Division.</p>
<p>If one could for a moment forget the earthquake of January 12th, the 200,000 dead people and millions of Haitians in distress, the Pétionville golf club would be a beautiful place, with immaculate landscaping and vistas over the Caribbean. In the wake of the catastrophe, an estimated 60,000 Haitians rushed to its slopes, where they languish in tents fashioned from tree branches, bedsheets and rope.</p>
<p>Some 300 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division occupy the heights above the displaced Haitians, bivouacked in the clubhouse and tennis courts. The American actor Sean Penn, who with a former Bosnian refugee-turned-millionairess founded an instant NGO, is camping on one of the tennis courts. There are army lorries, Humvees painted desert tan from Iraq, and tonnes of food and water, waiting for distribution.</p>
<p>But crowd control remains an almost insurmountable problem. Word has gone out that the impoverished masses at the Pétionville Club will receive food and water, and the camp grows daily, with some aid workers saying it now numbers 100,000. Oxfam has done a heroic job of installing giant water bladders with taps, but this is insufficient.</p>
<p>The US Catholic Relief Service (CRS) was able to distribute 1,300 food kits late last week, but full-scale distribution has repeatedly been delayed for fear of food riots, while CRS divides the camp into A, B, C and D blocks and distributes a voucher to the mother of each family, in the hope of organising an orderly distribution. If all goes well, CRS will begin its distribution today. &#8220;If it takes an extra day to do it right, it&rsquo;s worth it,&#8221; says Donal Reilly, the Dubliner in charge of food distribution for CRS.</p>
<p>The camp, one of the largest of some 500 in Port-au-Prince, is becoming infamous as a place where the displaced can find water and a modicum of security, provided by the US military, but no food. It&rsquo;s not entirely true; the 82nd Airborne gave away 10,000 meals each day until Saturday, making this camp the US military&rsquo;s largest distribution point in Port-au-Prince. But the Americans decided the food attracted too many people to a volatile site, and temporarily stopped it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The crowd has calmed down,&#8221; Lt Brad Kerfoot said as he surveyed the tent city below us. Fights broke out the previous day when CRS tried to distribute vouchers  &mdash;  not even food, just vouchers. &#8220;We told them we wouldn&rsquo;t give any food away today, because of the way they behaved yesterday,&#8221; says Kerfoot.</p>
<p>The military and CRS officials say there are no signs of starvation in the camp. Some of its inhabitants have enough money to buy food in the local market. And the soldiers say they see ration boxes hoarded in what they call &#8220;the village&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yesterday, they threw water bottles back at us and said, &#8216;We don&rsquo;t want your water&rsquo;,&#8221; Lt Kerfoot says. &#8220;When we gave out high energy biscuits, they threw them on the ground and stomped on them when they saw they were cookies. My soldiers and I think they&rsquo;re ungrateful.&#8221;</p>
<p>The displaced Haitians want food, not water, a Haitian woman explained to me. And in their culture, biscuits are not real food, but something given to children.</p>
<p>During the day, Lt Kerfoot positions two riflemen armed with M4s above the camp. After nightfall, there&rsquo;s an entire squadron. &#8220;There&rsquo;s people in the camp with guns,&#8221; explains Donal Reilly of CRS. &#8220;There&rsquo;ve been knife fights. The Americans told me last night the Haitians were selling drugs. It&rsquo;s turning into a typical Port-au-Prince slum, and there&rsquo;s not one policeman down there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nor is there a single toilet or shower, for 60,000 people. Piles of rubbish smoulder between the tents. Women fry fritters and fish on charcoal stoves beside their shelters. Reilly worries about sanitation and the fire hazard. There are no fire breaks, and the bedsheet tents are highly flammable.</p>
<p>Amid the picnic tables and golf tees in this refuge of Haiti&rsquo;s pre-quake elite, there are heart-breaking scenes. In dozens of tents, people told me they were hungry, thirsty and had nowhere to go. Several said they expected to die in the Pétionville Club.</p>
<p>But even in the worst deprivation, Haitians have maintained a sense of humour. One bedsheet tent bore a cardboard sign declaring it to be &#8220;Tikay O Beach&#8221;.</p>
<p>Louissant Banningchton (26), a painter who wears his dreadlocks in a knitted snood, constructed a &#8220;Presidential Palace&#8221; of cardboard boxes stamped &#8220;Humanitarian daily rations. Food gift from the people of the United States of America&#8221;. &#8220;Thank you Jesus,&#8221; &#8220;Haiti 4 America&#8221; and &#8220;God Bless America&#8221; are slogans Banningchton painted on the &#8220;palace&#8221; before declaring himself president.</p>
<p>A few miles away, at Turgeau, the Irish aid group Goal was carrying out its second distribution of basic food supplies. By last night Goal was to have given a 15-day food supply to 9,000 peoples. Goal&rsquo;s emergency co-ordinator, Brian Casey, had carefully assessed the neighbourhood&rsquo;s needs, and co-ordinated the distribution with local leaders. The hand-out nonetheless started tensely, with Haitians from other neighbourhoods clamouring for food being held back by Sri Lankan UN troops.</p>
<p>For John O&rsquo;Shea, the head of Goal who visited Port-au-Prince at the weekend, the Haitian relief effort is still too little, too slowly. &#8220;Up to 1.5 million people need all of their basic requirements seen to,&#8221; O&rsquo;Shea said. &#8220;There isn&rsquo;t an entity on the planet that can satisfy the needs of 1.5 million people. We don&rsquo;t have it because the international community hasn&rsquo;t established an international fire brigade.&#8221;</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Shea believes Ireland is the nation best qualified to established such an organisation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he wants President Barack Obama, who has sent $100 million in aid and 12,000 military personnel, to be given overall authority  &mdash;  not the UN. &#8220;The one phrase I heard most here was: &#8216;Who in God&rsquo;s name is in charge?&rsquo; &#8221; says O&rsquo;Shea.<br>

<p>Even when you give them aid and help, they still act like spoiled children.</p>
<p>One condition for food distribution should be NO WEAPONS. That would force the trouble makers to either move to the side or force a confrontation where troops would have just cause to cart them away.</p>

		<p>In other words, they could all have provisions, if they would just behave.  But they can&rsquo;t behave, and so they can&rsquo;t have provisions.  Utter insanity.  </p>

<p>Well, GOOD! Let the Irishers send THEIR young men and women to various overseas destinations and spend vast sums of money to alleviate misery. Ireland likes to say it is no longer such a poor country, so they can do their share.</p>
<p>Americans have taken too much abuse from ingrates for too long. NOW it is the turn of the Irish. If O&rsquo;Shea wants to do it, well, &#8220;top o&rsquo; the morning to you now!!&#8221;</p>

		<p>If anyone here has Google Earth  &mdash;  there is a very recent image of Port-au-Prince.  It looks like a war zone.</p>
<p>Reminds me of the account on this site about what went on post-Katrina.  Blacks were taking the &#8220;good&#8221; parts of the meals and discarding the rest.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a bunch of ingrates.  They can either eat what&rsquo;s available, or they can starve, no two ways about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the meantime, he wants President Barack Obama, who has sent $100 million in aid and 12,000 military personnel, to be given overall authority &mdash; not the UN. &ldquo;The one phrase I heard most here was: &lsquo;Who in God&rsquo;s name is in charge?&rsquo; &rdquo; says O&rsquo;Shea.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think your first black president has a good chance to annex Haiti as the 51-st state of the US if he plays his cards right&hellip;</p>
<p>Wouldnt it be wonderfull to live in a growing empire?</p>

This says it all: those in the world who give in to this nonsense are supposed to be ever-ready to handle the complete implosion of all black nations at all times, in all their overpopulated, undermanaged, dysfuctional agony.<br>
But he&rsquo;s right, there is no such resource; the concept is astounding: the tiny white world is supposed to run an unbelievably massive daycare operation for the bloated third world, ready at a moment&rsquo;s notice to clean up the poop, wipe up the spittle, pour the kool-aid, etc.<br>
Wow.<br>

<p>Fights broke out the previous day when CRS tried to distribute vouchers &mdash; not even food, just vouchers. &ldquo;We told them we wouldn&rsquo;t give any food away today, because of the way they behaved yesterday,&rdquo; says [Lt Brad] Kerfoot.</p>
<p><br>
Sounds like the sort of &#8220;tough love&#8221; that Haiti needs not just during a crisis, but on a PERMANENT basis. Lt. Kerfoot&rsquo;s Behavioristic approach (reinforcing good behavior/punishing bad behavior) evinces a deep understanding of the Haitian situation: in any encounter between whites and blacks, the whites are the adults in the room and the blacks are the children. And usually spoiled, unruly, obnoxious, DANGEROUS children, at that. </p>
<p>Taking this sort of adults-vs-children, tough-love attitude towards Haitians is no doubt &#8220;condescending,&#8221; &#8220;paternalistic,&#8221; &#8220;Victorian,&#8221; and, of course, &#8220;racist.&#8221; But being ruled by non-black outsiders also happens to be the ONE thing that might   &mdash;   MIGHT   &mdash;   finally start producing some improvements in that basket case of a country. </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s funny, nowhere in the three stories on Haiti in the New York Times is anything like this mentioned. Yet the Irish times quotes American soldiers. Shouldn&rsquo;t our soldiers have a voice in the Paper of Record?  Here&rsquo;s a typical excerpt from one of the Times articles:</p>
<p>&#8220;Its streets clogged with trucks bringing aid and removing rubble, Port-au-Prince was a mix of desperation and determination on Wednesday. Crowds continued to fill food distribution sites  &mdash;  Brazilian soldiers had sprayed tear gas at Haitians jostling for food on Tuesday  &mdash;  while medical students from Quisqueya University set up tents beside the ruins of their university to provide postoperative care to overflow patients from the General Hospital. They wore newly made T-shirts that said, &#8216;We will go on, hand in hand.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Later on the article discloses that</p>
<p>&#8220;In a growing cash-for-work program, the United Nations sent more than 11,000 earthquake survivors to clean the rubble-strewn streets in the capital and other hard-hit areas, paying them the Haitian minimum wage, about 60 cents an hour. The United Nations aspires to put at least 100,000 Haitians to work in this program.&#8221;</p>
<p>1.Perhaps I&rsquo;m off the mark, but I believe that elsewhere the UN doesn&rsquo;t typically come in and pay people to clean up their own natural disasters.</p>
<p>2.Putting &#8220;at least&#8221; 100,000 people in this program would run at least $480,000 a day, assuming 8-hr workdays and assuming benefits wouldn&rsquo;t be included, which is doubtful. What if someone gets injured &#8220;on the job&#8221;? </p>

		<p>Alexandra, # 6  &mdash;   What you said about blacks taking the &#8220;good parts&#8221; of the meals nd leaving the rest  &mdash;  I had to laugh. I once worked in an almost all-black office. Once we had a bagel tray brought in for a meeting, and at the end of breakfast, the only thing left were the bagel bottoms! Nobody wanted them&hellip; Brought the bottoms home  &mdash;  they toasted up just fine, but the black women just wanted the tops. *smile* What&rsquo;s a little entitlement among co-workers!</p>

<p><br>
What?   Do I understand that the Haitians (now more than two weeks after the disaster) will helplessly sit and WAIT until someone comes from outside, organizes them,  and PAYS them to clean up their own city?</p>
<p>That, in a nutshell, explains why their country is a perpetual disaster zone   &mdash;    and will always remain so,  earthquakes or not.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, the worst disaster there is not the earthquake; it&rsquo;s the demography.</p>

<p>Yes indeed Voter! and that is exactly the conduct they will continue to exhibit when they are all brought to the U.S. Why should they be any different than American blacks?<br>
