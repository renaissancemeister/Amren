<h1>Vicente Fox Stresses Value of Partnerships in UNC Speech</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>C. Ryan Barber, Daily Tar Heel (University of North Carolina), January 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fox [Vicente Fox] received $42,500 from the Van and Kay Weatherspoon endowment to deliver this year&rsquo;s Weatherspoon Lecture, which has hosted figures such as magazine editor Steve Forbes and Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward.</p>
<p>The speech, titled &#8220;Surveying the Geo-Political Landscape,&#8221; touched on the need for nations across the globe to become unified to overcome pressing challenges.</p>
<p>The speech specifically addressed the relationship between Mexico and the United States with regard to immigration, drug trafficking and free trade.</p>
<p>Fox, whose grandfather migrated to Mexico from the United States, opened the lecture by voicing his support for Mexican immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are real heroes, incomprehensible heroes,&#8221; Fox said. But the majority of the speech highlighted the value of developing partnerships, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of building walls, let&rsquo;s build bridges,&#8221; Fox said, referring to both U.S. immigration policy and free trade.</p>
<p>Fox, championed for strengthening Mexico&rsquo;s democracy after ousting the 71-year rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, also stressed the value of democracy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Paul Cuadros, journalism professor and author of &#8220;A Home on the Field,&#8221; a book about coaching a high school soccer team composed mostly of Latino immigrants, said Fox was correct in his attitude against the policy requiring illegal immigrants in North Carolina to pay out-of-state tuition.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he was spot on in terms of if there is one set of doors that should be open to everyone, it should be the schoolhouse doors,&#8221; he said.</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.fightbacknews.org/2009/09/interview-with-haley-koch.htm">Charges Dismissed in Trial of Anti-Racist Activist</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Fight Back News, September 17, 2009</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Fight Back! interviewed UNC Chapel Hill activist Haley Koch about her trial on Monday, September 15, in which all charges relating to her arrest for the protest of Tom Tancredo were dropped. Koch took part in a large protest of students who shut down the racist, anti-immigrant speaker at UNC&rsquo;s campus last April.</p>
<p><b>Fight Back: </b>Please give us a little background about the trial. What where you charged with?</p>
<p><b>Haley Koch: </b>I was charged with &#8220;disturbing the peace at an educational institution,&#8221; a subsection of the disorderly conduct statute. I was arrested nine days following the protest of the white supremacist hate group Youth for Western Civilization (YWC) and the racist, xenophobic Tom Tancredo. Although more than 250 students and community members expressed their outrage and disapproval at his presence, I was the only person arrested. I was handcuffed outside my class, in front of my classmates and professor, and walked across campus before being patted down, searched, and then taken to the police station. This followed the disgraceful behavior of the University and its police forces in their apology to Tom Tancredo and their harassment of student activists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I believe the dismissal sent a strong message to the University community that protest (even loud, visible protest) is legal and should not be repressed and policed in the way it was. I should hope that they would think harder about arresting protesters in the future. I also hope that students take note that we can and will have our voices heard.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} At a time when the University, local media and campus liberals were all speaking out against the protesters, organizational and individual letters and petitions in solidarity renewed our energy and helped us to feel less isolated and alone. The repression at the time was intense, meant to fragment, demoralize, and silence us. It might have worked were it not for the amazing support we received from across the country and around the world. At a time when I was receiving hate mail and being threatened on white supremacist and white nationalist websites, it was incredibly encouraging to know that there were many people out there dedicated to the same struggles, people who are willing to support each other in whatever ways they can and who live their lives committed to fighting these oppressive forces.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Haley Koch: </b>{snip}</p>
<p>YWC is planning to bring Bay Buchanan later this year. There will be protests. I still have hopes that the advisor and the president will come to realize that they are enabling a white supremacist hate group and will choose to step down. But, if they desire a fight, they should know that we have the strength and resources for it.</p>
<p>We will continue to organize against fascism, racism, and hate speech. These oppressions must not be allowed on our campus or in our communities.</p>
<p><b>Fight Back: </b>The struggle against YWC has also put forward to other demands about a police review board and a hate speech policy at UNC, can you briefly let us know what is going on with that?</p>
<p><b>Haley Koch: </b>The Protesters Defense Committee (PDC) is having conversations with Student Government about creating a police review board, and we will continue to fight for this. The next step will be mobilizing broader student and faculty support. We now have recorded testimony by police officer Lieutenant Twiddy saying that he shoved me to the ground that I believe will help in this struggle.</p>
<p>Several of us are meeting with Chancellor Thorp in the coming weeks to discuss the University&rsquo;s acceptance of hate and to explore ways to make the campus community a place safe for all students.</p>

		<p>When I was in grad school at UNC-CH in the mid-70&rsquo;s, there was room for EVERY viewpoint to be heard.  No one was shouted down; it was a time before PC had become standard practice at UNC.  I am disgusted with my former school for giving in to that, let&rsquo;s face it, came from Yankee Ivy League schools.  I was proud to be at school in the South, at the first state university in the entire U.S. - but I am disheartened to see that the university I loved is now nothing more than a rubber stamp on the PC &#8220;morality.&#8221;  What a crock.  I hope they&rsquo;re still celebrating Robt. E. Lee&rsquo;s birthday in lieu of Lincoln&rsquo;s&hellip;. but probably not.  What a shame.</p>

<p>That wasn&rsquo;t just a &#8220;protest,&#8221; that liar. That was a deliberate attempt to drown out an invited  speaker and infringe on his freedom of speech. </p>
<p>Then this same idiot goes on about having their &#8220;voices heard!!&#8221; The utter unmitigated gall! It&rsquo;s another case of &#8220;freedom of speech for me but not for thee.&#8221;</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;UNC Chapel Hill activist Haley Koch about her trial on Monday, September 15, in which all charges relating to her arrest for the protest of Tom Tancredo were dropped. Koch took part in a large protest of students who shut down the racist, anti-immigrant speaker at UNC&rsquo;s campus last April&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This little pretend Soviet Boss AND unenlightened, idiot president bowles of UNC need a few lessons on the First Amendment:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;[T]he First Amendment is designed in part to protect precisely that speech which a community finds most disagreeable, most offensive, and most antithetical to that community&rsquo;s values. This protection stems directly from a deep, abiding respect for the intelligence of the American citizen&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And, from UNC&rsquo;s OWN Policy on Prohibited Harassment and Discrimination 09-10:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Harassment or intimidation that abuses, disparages, or otherwise interferes with another so as to adversely affect their&hellip; participation in University-sponsored extracurricular activities, or opportunities to benefit from other aspects of University life&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Did ms. koch not do exactly that and violate UNC&rsquo;s own stated policy?  Did she not interfere with Tancredo&rsquo;s right to speak no matter how &#8216;disagreeable&rsquo; she may have found what he had to say and violate the rights of those in attendance who came to hear what Tancredo had to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.The First Amendment entrusts adult citizens with the power to judge the merit of speech for themselves, answering only to the dictates of their own conscience&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>So UNC gives tacit approval to ms. koch to over-ride not only Tancredo&rsquo;s First Amendment rights, but the rights of other students to &#8216;judge the merits of speech for themselves.&rsquo;  In other words, according to the university, koch gets to play Kommissar  and decide which speech is acceptable or not acceptable for EVERYONE.</p>
<p>Is this a university or a Soviet satellite? </p>
<p>On a side note, president eskine bowles is considering implementing a system-wide hate speech code  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m sure ms. koch will be the final arbiter as to what constitutes &#8216;hate speech.&rsquo; </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Today, FIRE sent a letter to University of North Carolina President Erskine Bowles &hellip; arguing against the implementation of a system-wide hate speech code. Bowles formed the study commission following the discovery of racist comments painted in North Carolina State University&rsquo;s Free Expression Tunnel after President Barack Obama&rsquo;s victory last November&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yfb4ygh" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yfb4ygh</a> </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet this is another False Flag-type hoax perpetuated by the likes of ms. koch in order to hasten the implementation of Hate Speech codes.</p>
<p>Ms. koch is a fascist and an enemy of liberty and should be shut down.  The law is only what SHE says it is, people are only allowed to say what she approves of. According to her NWO way of thinking:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead inside you&hellip;.You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty and then we shall fill you with ourselves&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that just a little bit backwards? Apologizing to someone wronged is &#8216;disgraceful&rsquo;? The Arrest of one student is &#8216;harassment&rsquo;? Wasn&rsquo;t it Rep Tom Tancredo who was forced to leave the building and wasn&rsquo;t it the &#8216;fascists&rsquo;, or whatever, students, who were chased around campus? What he is saying is quite a bit backwards. Completely backwards. Calling George Orwell. You know, there are signs our nation has become a nightmare like in the book 1984, or like some reported the old soviet union to be&hellip; I hate to say it in this manner&hellip; but I&rsquo;m really starting to wonder if our nation has simply become blackified. Are we really just the &#8216;ebonic&rsquo; nation now?</p>

		<p>where are the &#8220;freedom to speak&#8221; advocates?  So much for the &#8220;academy as a place to freely pursue knowledge&#8221; idea. This brings to mind the fiasco at Duke a few years back when the Lacrosse players were falsely accused. Recall that 88 so-called &#8220;professors&#8221; signed a petition condemning the lacrosse players even before all the facts were known!! As it turned out, the players were all exonerated. Yet Duke never condemned the &#8220;professors&#8221; for rushing to judgement. The &#8220;herd&#8221; instinct is alive and well in academia!!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about the juxtapositioning of these two articles  and the lack of commentary on Vicente Fox&rsquo;s $42,000 speech before the UNC-CH Kenan-Flager School of Business. It is also no coincidence that the UNC-CH J-School professor Paul Cuadros (from the Chicago school of community organizing) and author of the 2009 entering freshman class summer reading assignment is in this woodpile too.</p>

		<p>The schoolhouse doors are open in mexico. Mexicans should take advantage of this. It is better to learn in mexico, thatn work like a slave in the USA. Mexican schools are among the best in the world, the people are friendly and the country is nice. They speak your language and have your values. Why would any same man live in the hellhole that is the USA when they could live in Mexico?</p>

<p>They made a big attempt to compare this to &#8216;historical rape&rsquo;. To show this incident as a continuation of &#8216;oppression&rsquo;. For one, I&rsquo;d be interested in knowing what year More black women were raped by white men, than white women were raped by black men. Just raw numbers, ignoring the population difference (the greater number of rapist white men in the population). Please, just show us the year in history. Last I checked, each year over 20,000 white women (docurama&rsquo;s aside) are raped by black men, while the number of black women raped by white men is close to 40. That&rsquo;s more than a 600 to 1 greater ratio. Year after year. But who&rsquo;s counting? Apparently not this time, the liberals. </p>
