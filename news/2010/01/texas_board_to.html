<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20100113/US.Texas.Schools.Social.Studies/?CID=Net_Newsmain">Texas Board to Take 1st Vote on History Curriculum</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>April Castro, Comcast News, January 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New history standards that will determine what Texas public school students will be learning for the next decade are coming up for a first vote.</p>
<p>Committees of teachers and experts have crafted the proposal that will be up for consideration by the State Board of Education on Thursday. Dozens of amendments and ideological battles are expected.</p>
<p>Whichever curriculum standards the board chooses will be the guideposts for teaching history and social studies to some 4.8 million K-12 students for 10 years. The standards will be used to develop state tests and also by textbook publishers who develop material for the nation based on Texas, one of the largest markets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Early squabbles over how much prominence to give civil rights leaders such as Cesar Chavez and the inclusion of Christmas seem to have been smoothed over in the draft now being considered. But those issues could re-emerge as board members raise amendments for consideration before the vote.</p>
<p>In more than seven hours of public testimony on Wednesday, the board was asked to include more examples of Mexican American leaders. Amendments proposing that Hispanics be included in the fifth-grade social studies lessons, which lack examples of Latinos, are likely.</p>
<p>Another flashpoint is expected over how much emphasis should be given to the religious beliefs of the nation&rsquo;s founding fathers, after some activists have sought to promote and highlight their Christianity.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, the conservative proposals won&rsquo;t translate well into Chicano Spanish.  And, that will be the language one will have to use to teach Texas&rsquo;s public school students in the coming decades.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Students need to know more about the Mexicans who helped build America.&#8221;</p>
<p>I disagree.  I think they should know more about how Mexicans murdered the men at the Alamo after they over ran it.</p>
<p>Also, I think they should know how many of them refuse to assimilate and want to take our country over, in addition to their high rates of crime and their almost zero contributions to this society.</p>

		<p>Yeah, like white kids need to know about &#8220;the blacks, Chinese and Mexicans upon whose shoulders the whites stood as they made these people of color do all the work of building this country&hellip;.&#8221;  This is revisionist history at its best, and the whites should fight it with every last drop of their Texas blood - remember, folks, &#8220;The Eyes of Texas are Upon You!&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Mexicans who helped build America.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m somewhat of a history buff. I&rsquo;ve never come across any substantial contribution of Mexicans to this nation. Of course there are going to be a some people of almost any nation or culture one could think of, that perhaps contributed to the building of this nation in some small way, but the overall picture is absolutely clear for anyone that cares to examine U.S. history. Northwestern Europeans and later Southern and Eastern Europeans and their descendants built the U.S.A. and gave it the culture and customs it has had for three hundred plus years. It borders on surreal that todays European American descended youths, are practically ignorant of this fact, especially when one considers that it was always well know in most foreign nations who it was that established and built the U.S.A. Also, it&rsquo;s almost a twilight zone phenomenon, to think that when someone who is white, states this fact,they are looked upon as somehow being racist. This has happened to me and it really amazed me. Would you like to guess what racial group accused me of being racist for stating this fact? Hint: IT WASN&rsquo;T A NON-WHITE INDIVIDUAL! </p>

		<p>The first thing that Socialists do when they start grasping for power is to rewrite history. The Nazis did it, the Muslims are still doing it, the Communists excelled at it. We all know that at the time of Mohammed most of the Middle East was Christan, the results of their murderous rampage against them was the Crusades.<br>
Today the Crusades are depicted as an onslaught by the barbaric Christians against the innocent Muslims who were doing their utmost to protect the poor persecuted Jews. That is what a few billion dollars of oil money can do.  The Palestinians are now proclaiming to the world that the dead sea scrolls, written by the Jews for the Jews in the land of the Jews are a priceless Palestinian heritage. The seem to have forgotten that at the time of the Muslim sack of the great library of Alexandria everything was burnt on the grounds that it did not comply with the Koran. Even the Egyptians are now jumping on the bandwagon, they have just declared that the pyramids were built by paid employees of the Pharaoh who had the best of employee benefits.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that research has shown that those students entering the fields of education, like our current crop of teachers and school administrators, are the ones with the lowest scores. The only way they can hold their heads up is to make sure their pupils have even less knowledge they they have. You now have a choice, hang or fire the lot or be prepared for your children to come home from school and praise the magnificent efforts of the Hispanic in building your fair land.<br>

		<p>I think one of the things that should be made clear in the new history courses, is who exactly are the «Hispanics» or «Latinos»&hellip;</p>
<p>Those terms are constructs. They don&rsquo;t say much about the origin or ethnicity of Mexican people who live in the US.</p>
<p>In Mexico, they more or less have an unofficial caste system: there are the criollos people (White people, of mostrly Spanish descent but also of many other possible European origins); the Mestizos, or those of mixed European and Mayan, Aztec and Tultec ancestry (they actually look more Indian-like than White, in most cases); and there are also the Indios, or the Mexican-Indian communities.</p>
<p>The illegal immigrants who are present in considerable numbers, in some areas of the US, are mostly Mestizo people. </p>
<p>Terms like «Latino» and «Hispanic» are politically correct, perhaps, but inaccurate. Plus, they put people who look like Cameron Diaz or Charlie Sheen, in the same purely artificial category as people who look like, say, Edward James Olmos or Lou Diamond Philips.</p>

		<p>In my own Anglo-White dialect, the correct phase is &#8220;to the victors go the spoils.&#8221; </p>
<p>Revising history to reflect the views of Hispanics is only natural at this point as Hispanics claim North America, take over, and institute their own historical and political views over the ones we once held.</p>
<p>This was all orchestrated by a small group of elite Whites who prospered by betraying their own race. Without their systematic dismantlement of America and Europe, America and Europe would be completely White and free.</p>
<p>We no longer live in America, my friends. America is dead. Europeans no long live in Europe. Europe is dead. Whites peacefully surrendered to Hispanics, Blacks, and Muslims without a fight. We were outbred and betrayed. Game over&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;unless a complete world economic collapse occurs and Whites make the correct choices this time. The one trait we need to lose is interracial altruism. That is the one self-destructive trait many of us seem to possess. </p>
<p>Intraracial altruism is what makes us a great people; Whites helping whites as a close knit community of contributors. When other races and ethnicities are introduced into our communities, they prey on our good will. America and Europe should be 100% White.</p>

		<p>The Aztecs built a few simple block pyramids and the Spaniards built beautiful buildings throughout Mexico, but the Mexicans have built nothing.  </p>
<p>The Mexicans have invented nothing. </p>
<p>The Mexicans have accomplished nothing.  </p>
<p>Mexico is a failed nation that sends the illegal dregs of its criminal society to American that they may live off of the largess of better men and women than themselves&hellip;   </p>
