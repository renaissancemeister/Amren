<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world/20100117/INTERNATIONAL-US-QUAKE-HAITI-VOODOO/">Haiti&rsquo;s Voodoo Priests Object to Mass Burials</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joseph Guyler Delva, Reuters, January 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Haiti&rsquo;s voodoo priests are objecting to anonymous mass burials as an improper way to handle the tens of thousands of dead from the earthquake  &mdash;  and have taken their complaint to President Rene Preval.</p>
<p>Dumping the dead in hurriedly excavated mass graves without proper rites is seen as desecration in a country where many believe in zombies  &mdash;  dead bodies brought back to life by supernatural forces who could persecute the living.</p>
<p>Haitian officials say so far at least 50,000 bodies have been dumped in mass graves outside the shattered capital, Port-au-Prince, in what they view as the most efficient way to dispose of the fast-rotting corpses from Tuesday&rsquo;s disaster.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Local radio is broadcasting messages for Haitians to put bodies recovered from under the rubble of collapsed buildings on the street for collection by garbage and other trucks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The conditions in which bodies are being buried is not respecting the dignity of these people,&#8221; Beauvoir, who was educated at City College of New York and the Sorbonne in Paris, said in the Preval meeting this weekend.</p>
<p>More than half of Haiti&rsquo;s 9 million people are believed to practice voodoo, a religion with roots in Africa. Some 80 percent also are Catholic and most Haitians see no conflict between the two.</p>
<p>Five days after the earthquake, scores of untouched corpses, now bloated and stinking, remain on streets. Red Cross officials have repeatedly said no one should fear disease from dead bodies after the earthquake that is believed to have killed up to 200,000 people.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Fear island soon to be overrun by 50,000 zombies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, but would they be any worse than the roving gangs of black criminals who have been in the area for years now? <br>

		<p>The concept of dead corpses becoming reanimated and walking around is itself one of the most depraved and distasteful tenets of any religion. That and the concept of putting a curse on ones enemies which is another famous tenet of voodoo. So it is not surprising that these are both common beliefs in Haiti.</p>

		<p>WOW! 200,000 dead. I have not seen that figure before. And in the tropics, getting those bodies disposed of is of major importance. This entire situation is not coming under control. Is spiraling out of hand even worse? Soon we shall see masses of Haitians being brought to the U.S. as a last resort. Well, it is ONLY 9 million. What do we have to fear? American has always been good to migrants.</p>

		<p>Just watched an old zombie movie called `Night Of The Living dead`(directed By George Romero)<br>
Possibly this was the same movie the voodoo priests in Haiti might have been watching also </p>
<p>This whole thing is getting close to a real B grade horror flick day by day and I really dont know what to make of  <br>
 distinguishing real news from horror pulp fiction   </p>
<p>Well for the time being the `zombies` are in Haiti along way away<br>
But maybe its only a matter of time before  they  come swarming over here  bringing their voodoo and primitive superstitions <br>
to `enrich` our wonderful way of life. <br>
To quote another often quoted here`May God Help us All! </p>

		<p>Given Haiti&rsquo;s past record of economic prosperity and domestic tranquility, 50,000 zombies would probably not harm the country.  It might improve tourism; after all, we now have gang tourism in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Better yet, we could let the zombies all immigrate to the US, but we&rsquo;d have to come up with some PC term for them so their self-esteem isn&rsquo;t damaged.  I don&rsquo;t think the term &#8220;Necro-Americans&#8221; is in use yet.  Remember; they&rsquo;re not dead - they&rsquo;re metaphysically challenged (is that legally a disability?)</p>

		<p>The figure of 200,000 dead is quite something for a country with Haiti&rsquo;s population.  That&rsquo;s over 2% of the whole!  Since the only way to kill such large numbers of people with an earthquake is to either have a tsunami drown them or have heavy structures collapse onto them, one must wonder - since the damage was not caused by tsunamis - what the building codes in Haiti are like and how they are enforced (haha - just kidding there.  One need not wonder at all.)</p>
<p>Again, I can&rsquo;t help but think that if the population of the island of Hispaniola was white, the place would be a vacation paradise; swimming at the beaches, scuba diving on the reefs, hiking and horseback riding in the hills - which would still have trees on them - and fresh seafood at five-star restaurants.</p>

		<p>Some very insightful and humorous comments above!</p>
<p>Particularly, the link to SBPDL by Eric. </p>
<p>One observation that I would like to make about The Night of the Living Dead and its sequels, is that George Romero has many times in interviews stated that he intended to depict the counterculture of the 60s as taking over the USA in these films. Oddly, the zombies he has claimed, were supposed to represent the hippies and yippies of that time. He saw it as a demonstration of how a more primitively equipped and shambling (i.e., spaced out) minority, might overrun a superior and technologically advanced majority because of its unwillingness to unite against the threat posed to them because of irrational sentimentality.</p>
<p>I am not kidding you here, I have read these types of statements more than once by the man; even if it was not quite so coherently and concisely articulated by him. He also reveled in the idea, being the typical artsy &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; that enjoys so much success in this country&rsquo;s media. Unsurprisingly, he is a good friend of another macabre Marxist, Stephen King.</p>
<p>Ironically, he never seems to have grasped that the warning words of most of the scientists in his films about the zombies, do accurately reflect how to deal with the problems of countercultural revolution and the nonwhite &ldquo;immigration&rdquo; issue it has used as a primary weapon to Communize this country. That, or perhaps, he was being smugly abusive in pointing out the weakness he perceived in America&rsquo;s passively maudlin white majority?  </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Am I a racist if I kill a black Zombie?  Does it matter if I also have a policy that requires me to kill White Zombies?  What about illegal immigrant Zombies?  Do I first have to pay for their health insurance?</p>
<p>I sure hope the Federal Government gives a couple of million dollars to ACORN to do a study on this problem to show me why zombie-ism is my fault&hellip;.</p>
