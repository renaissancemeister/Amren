			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Tatchell, Huffington Post, January 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Britain, however, we can only dream of a black head of state. It isn&rsquo;t going to happen any time soon because the UK system is rigged against a black leader. Black and Asian Britons are effectively barred by the system of hereditary monarchy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under Britain&rsquo;s constitutional system, the head of state is the monarch  &mdash;  at present Queen Elizabeth II, head of the House of Windsor. The position of monarch and head of state is inherited through the Windsor family line. The Windsors are white and only their descendants are eligible to be monarch and British head of state. The result is a de facto race bar.</p>
<p>When the Queen dies, her role as head of state will pass to her first-born son, Charles. When he is dead, the title will pass to his first-born son, William and so on. From white person to white person to white person. Under this system, black people are excluded. The all-white Windsor family has the exclusive franchise on the office of head of state.</p>
<p>This white-favouring feudal system is totally out of step with the democratic, egalitarian and meritocratic ethos of modern British life.</p>
<p>A head of state is supposed to represent the nation and its people, and to symbolise its values and culture. In a diverse multi-ethnic society such as Britain, surely it is wrong to automatically, a priori, deny this honoured, revered role to non-white citizens?</p>
<p>Whichever way the defenders of monarchy try to spin it, there is no escaping the fact that the head of state position is open to only the white Windsors. Non-white people are shut out for decades to come, and possibly much longer. They cannot hold the title of British head of state.</p>
<p>This makes the current method of appointing the head of state racist by default. Although it was not devised with racist intent, it is racist in effect. It reflects an institutional racism, where the system of appointment favours one race over others.</p>
<p>Despite monarchist protestations to the contrary, because the system gives a race preference, even though this is an unintended side effect, the hereditary method of choosing the British head of state from the all-white Windsor family is racially exclusive and is racist in its consequence.</p>
<p>Equally appalling, this exclusion of non-white Britons excites no public outrage, not even from liberals, the left and African British anti-racist campaign groups. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The monarchical system may command majority support, at least for now. But this manner of determining Britain&rsquo;s head of state is surely an offensive, bigoted anachronism. It is premised on the assumption that the most ignorant, stupid, immoral white Windsor is more entitled to be head of state than the best-informed, wisest and most moral black Briton. This is a truly repulsive racist assumption.</p>
<p>Non-white people are, of course, not the only ones denied the highest office in Britain. There are gender and faith exclusions too. If a monarch&rsquo;s first child is a daughter and the subsequent children are sons, the daughter will be passed over and the succession will be granted to the eldest son. Catholics and people of non-Christian faiths are also barred from being monarchs and heads of state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is true, of course, that Britain could one day have a black head of state. If a future monarch married a non-white person, their first born child could ascend to the throne and become head of state. But this is a matter of &#8220;if&#8221; and &#8220;could&#8221;. There is no guarantee at all. In any case, why should black and Asian Britons have to wait in line for generations? It is a vile insult to make them stand at the back of the queue for the office of head of state.</p>
<p>The earliest change would be via Prince William. He is unlikely to become monarch for at least 25 years. If William married a black British woman his first-born male child from that marriage could inherit the head of state title, but only on William&rsquo;s death, which is likely to be more than half a century from now, in about 2080. The possibility that Britain could have a non-white head of state, like the US, is still a distant dream.</p>
<p>The institutions of monarch and head of state are currently conjoined. They don&rsquo;t have to be. The British Parliament could vote to separate them. Even if Britain decides to retain the monarchy, members of parliament could legislate that the monarch should no longer be head of state. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An elected president need not be a politician. He or she could be a writer, like the first democratic post-Soviet era Czech president, Vaclav Havel. Or an academic, scientist, athlete or humanitarian.</p>

		<p>I love how the writer of this article is really only concerned that a black person will never ascend the throne. He does not seem to care that Asians, Middle-Easterners, Jews, and Native Americans suffer a similar fate.</p>
<p>Liberals act similarly in college admissions. Admissions officers do whatever they can to ensure that at least 10% of an incoming class is black, yet they really don&rsquo;t care about their university&rsquo;s representation of Hispanics and Native Americans.<br>

<p>I have read some ridiculous stuff here at AR, but this Comrade Tatchell really takes the crown of Buffoonland with that above idiocy!</p>
<p>Even with the semi-reasoned stuff, such as the legislated separation of the monarchy and the head of state roles is more foolish than actually possible in Britain. This would be due to the fact that the UK is a constitutional monarchy and not a &ldquo;democracy,&rdquo; as is claimed by Comrade Tatchell. </p>
<p>Laughably, the only good that could come from such an odd suggestion, is that it would ironically divorce the House of Windsor from influencing the UK toward multicultural utopia. This is something which it seems hell-bent on under the reign of the current monarch, Queen Elizabeth, and will all too likely continue under a King Charles when she dies. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Wow!  What an idiot, going off on a wild tangent like that one.  Suppose this and suppose that, then one day there could be any mixture on the throne of England.  Not that I care about the throne of England or their government.  My ancestors broke ties with that bunch a long time ago.</p>

		<p>Notice it&rsquo;s all about race to this writer. Any white who doesn&rsquo;t happen to be in the Windsor family is not eligible for royalty (that&rsquo;s the whole point of the monarchy) but non of this matters to this nutty writer. Notice that the writer throws in hand-wringing about &#8220;gender and faith exclusions&#8221; towards the end, but it&rsquo;s clear his main concern is for blacks. And how many whites are head of state in Africa, or are ever likely to be, may I ask? But that doesn&rsquo;t concern this writer. I notice his title is &#8220;Human rights campaigner,&#8221; which means he has to fill a column with such drivel every week, or however often he writes.</p>

		<p>Under the present English Constitution, Roman Catholics are excluded from acceding to the throne.<br>
How about if the rules are changed to permit the throne to be inherited by black non-Catholics *only?* Sounds reasonable! (Oh, and throw in a few billions of reparations at the same time).</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s one big hitch in this analysis:  The monarchy doesn&rsquo;t exercise any real political power anymore.</p>
<p>After Obama got elected, the Tory biased papers like the Daily Mail and the Telegraph were all beating their chests about how Britain in general and the Conservative Party in specific is going to have to look for &#8220;our Obama.&#8221;  What surprised me, or really didn&rsquo;t, is that the &#8220;Conservatives&#8221; started beating these drums before Labour, for whom most black Britons vote.</p>

		<p>This is sick.  Extremely sick.  I am astounded that anyone would even think this way.  The Monarchy will come to a natural end when there are no longer enough British people (English, Scot, Welsh, Irish) to defend their heritage, their island and their Kingdom.  And that won&rsquo;t be 50 years from now.  My God the Queen herself might be alive long enough to be sent off to exile the way demographics are going.  And then Britain get someone superior, like a Mugabe.</p>

		<p> One would like to suspect that Mr. Tatchell is engaging in a straight-faced pulling of Britons&rsquo; collective leg here   &mdash;   but no! the man is actually serious!</p>
<p> Let me explain something to you, Mr. Tatchell. Britain was founded by Anglo-Saxons, Normans, Danes, etc., many centuries ago. A mixture, but all Caucasians, whom you seem to find distasteful. For many centuries, the British population was made up very hugely of just those White people. The arrival of blacks, Asians, etc., in any numbers is a recent (and in many ways unfortunate) phenomenon. Britain&rsquo;s monarchs are from its original stock   &mdash;   that is, the mixture of Anglo-Saxons and others of the European light-skinned persuasion   &mdash;   and have always been, going back as far as we can trace. Your precious non-Whites can become successful businessmen, or army generals, or navy admirals, or even the prime minister. But unless some misguided future Prince of Wales marries outside his race, they CANNOT BE THE KING OR QUEEN OF ENGLAND!!!</p>
<p> Hope that explains it for you sufficiently.</p>

<p>Meritocratic?!?  You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me!  What&rsquo;s &#8220;meritocratic&#8221; about a system that floods a country with millions of culture-destroying types at the expense of the culture-creator indigenous inhabitants?</p>
<p>Democratic?  Numerous polls show the MAJORITY of Britons want the immigration door closed, yet still they come.  So much for the myth of democracy in the UK.</p>

		<p>Mr. Tatchell is a very well known gay rights activist in Britain. A one time Labour parliamentary candidate, he intended to stand in the forthcoming general election for the Green party, but withdrew his candidature because brain damage suffered at the hands of Russian and Zimbabwean thugs rendered him unable to sustain the rigours of a campaign.<br>
He is a brave man, and has suffered greatly, but the brain damage seems to be much worse than was at first apparent. Let&rsquo;s hope he makes a full recovery, because although he has always been a pestilential leftie he does not deserve the degree of mental deterioration which this article discloses.</p>

		<p> The logical conclusion to the pathological embrace of {tolerance of diversity} and {multiculturalism} is the forced eradication of diversity and culture. The only ones thus prospering being the ones nature had justly marked out for lower rank or failure. On the ground level&hellip;I think blacks in England have been treated more humanely than English whites in South Africa. I think monarchy is based on natural excellence or aristocracy of a given phenotype. England is first Engles or Saxons as far as I know and why shouldn&rsquo;t it be? Otherwise why shouldn&rsquo;t some one else have the right to name it something else?</p>

		<p>The monarchy discriminates?  Oh, that too! Just imagine! Simply outrageous. How dare the queen pass down her crown to her oldest child! They&rsquo;re keeping it all to themselves. Obvious racism. This calls for some Affirmative Action, methinks.</p>
<p>I had not even thought of this aspect, but I should have. Eventually their complaining was going to come around to this as well. They manage to find an excuse to complain about simply EVERYTHING in our countries and our societies. If they hate our systems of government so much (and everything else about us), then why do they even bother being here?  </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want to live in a country that I found intolerable,  one that discriminates against me.  There are black kingdoms that have their own monarchies. (Nobody is complaining their African kings aren&rsquo;t white.)  For anyone dreaming of a throne, why don&rsquo;t they go and be king there?   Can&rsquo;t we beleaguered whites have anything to ourselves?</p>
<p>Oh, incidentally  (though this may seem petty quibbling to a black person), passing  down the crown through the royal line, also discriminates (and always has) against the vast majority of Britain&rsquo;s white population who are commoners and thus don&rsquo;t have even the slightest chance at ever sitting on the throne. Oh, but who cares about British commoners?  They&rsquo;re only white.</p>

<p>What country is John writing about? He can&rsquo;t mean the US, where &#8220;liberals&#8221; do all they can to make sure everyone except white males is overrepresented at universities and in almost every area of employment. I should also add that most hispanics are as unworthy of college admittance and employment in many fields as blacks. </p>

		<p>The author refers to Asian Britons and black Britons.  There exists no such animal.  Ask the Chinese.  They will tell you that Queen Elizabeth, though ruler of Hong Kong for over forty years, was, in fact, not Chinese.  </p>
<p>There are non White relatives of the royal family and have been for centuries, along with, at this point, thousands of White bastard children.  I don&rsquo;t believe they have a claim to the throne.</p>
<p>The royal family does now contain someone of Jewish descent.  The former Sophie Winkelman, a stunningly beautiful actress, married into the family and is now Lady Frederick Windsor.  I believe she is something like 32nd in line for the throne.  No one seems to have a problem with her because she is White, but more importantly she is not Catholic.  Did I mention she is really hot?</p>

		<p>Contrary to the way this writer goes on, the Windsor family does not have a lock on the monarchy in perpetuity.  England (and Scotland too) have had changes of dynasty from time to time, and quite a few of them over the span of history. The same is true all over Europe   &mdash;   as well as China, Japan, India, etc. Dynasties change.  Nothing is forever. </p>
<p>The present House of Windsor has only existed since 1917, although it was named Saxe-Coburg-Gotha since 1901.</p>
<p>I am surprised that the writer shows so much concern for blacks, and no one else. All commoners have been completely excluded from the succession or any possibility of it, throughout the history of the monarchy.  Are they discriminated against?  Most royal marriages were contracted with other reigning families of royal blood or, failing that, at least with high-born ladies from aristocratic families. No English monarch ever married the scullery maid or the laundress, no matter how great her qualities or abundant her charms. </p>
<p>[One slight exception: A widowed queen did marry the tutor, Owen Tudor (himself of princely origin).  Their descendents eventually became the Tudor dynasty. The legitimacy of the marriage was called into question, and after the queen&rsquo;s death he was imprisoned;  he was eventually beheaded.   It was a risky thing to dare to marry above one&rsquo;s born status!  Even Anne Boleyn, though untitled, was most definitely an aristocrat   &mdash;   as they all were.  It is interesting that among Henry VIII&rsquo;s wives, those having royal blood/connections never went to the block. Only the lesser ones did   &mdash;   those whose families did not have the power to muster armies. The royal ones were merely divorced or annulled, on fine technicalities, and their virtue was never attacked or questioned.]</p>

		<p>Absolutely the most asinine article I have ever read. Interesting that they do not make mention of the obvious fact that all whites who are not direct descendants of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II are also excluded from the privilege of becoming Britain&rsquo;s head of state. Last time I checked this was the majority of white Britons, although the way things are going this may soon change.</p>

		<p>This article sounds like a lampoon from The Onion!  <br>
And I believe the Brits changed the law so that first-born daughters can inherit the throne, didn&rsquo;t they?  Oh, well, this whole piece apparently doesn&rsquo;t have to rely on truth and logic, like everything else that belches from the cultural left.</p>

		<p>I wonder what would be Mr Tatchell&rsquo;s take on these pesky Japanese having only Japanese monarchs all the time, and a single line, too. Are they allowed, or is it also a discriminatory practice like with the Windsors? <br>
Should they instantly marry off their princess Aiko to an African to make amends?<br>

		<p>I suppose a suitable candidate would be the current King Mswati of Swaziland. As far as I am aware, he is the only ruling black  king anywhere. He&rsquo;s the one who fines any family one cow for failing to send their virgin daughters to his annual &#8216;reed dance&rsquo; festival where the girls lay on their backs waving their open legs for inspection by his majesty. He selects a new &#8216;wife&rsquo; every year (16 to date) and gives her a palace and her family a new Mercedes. The per-capita income in Swaziland is about 50 pence (around US 80 cents) per day but he doesn&rsquo;t support illegal black immigrants or give them housing and cash benefits which must help to balance the books. However, not being Roman Catholic may be a help if he wishes to challenge the house of Windsor for the succession. First he needs an immigration permit, unless he arrives with a diplomatic travel document. We do have reeds growing in Norfolk, England but we use them to thatch cottages and not everyone has spare cows readily to hand.</p>

		<p>Although I have no feelings one way or the other about the Royal Family, this is totally ludicrious.  </p>
<p>However, maybe some black can whittle his way into the Royal Family and marry one of the Windsor granddaughters and eventually&hellip; </p>

		<p>No black will ever sit on the throne of England  &mdash;  if it&rsquo;s still called &#8216;England&rsquo; or &#8216;Great Britain&rsquo; or &#8216;The United Kingdom&rsquo; in the near future.</p>
<p>According to Professor Richard Lynn: &#8220;by 2061 about two thirds of the population of Britain will be of non-European origin, while about one third will be White.&#8221;</p>
<p>And given that &#8216;demographics is destiny&rsquo; and that the new majority has no respect for the Rule of Law (only THEIR law, Sharia Law, which they&rsquo;re already calling for in parts of Britain), Private Property, Rights of Women (such as &#8220;A divorce is effective when the man tells his wife that he is divorcing her&#8221;), Freedom of Speech (mandating  &#8220;anyone who curses Allah be killed&#8221;) and death for homosexual activity does anyone believe that the New Muslim government will allow the White monarchy to keeps its vast personal wealth of jewels, money, estates, art (which will be burned), and monetary allowances?  </p>
<p>I wonder which &#8216;White&rsquo; country they&rsquo;ll flee to when the time comes?  Are they already transferring their wealth out of the country?  They well know what happened to their relatives in the Russian Royal family when the Bolsheviks seized control of the government.</p>
<p>As for English Whites in South Africa, this is from Dan Roodt&rsquo;s new article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;All in all, South Africa has got remarkably used to its new-found status as the crime capital of the world. The high-rise districts of Hillbrow and Berea in Johannesburg have been officially designated by Interpol as having the highest murder rate in the world, that is, 600 people per 100 000 population members per annum. Consider for a moment that such a figure represents 12 times the rate found in inner-city ghettoes in the United States, often seen as no-go zones by many Americans.</p>
<p>One British immigrant to South Africa who has survived three car hijackings, refuses to emigrate, stating that he is now accustomed to having Kalachnikovs pointed at him from pointblank range. Everyone knows a relative or friend who has been killed or at least subjected to some form of violent crime, and no South African can remotely imagine a society where people do not live behind razor wire, electrified fences, high walls, burglar bars and similar decorative props&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is utterly shocking! I had no idea that the lineage of the Windsors included no black Africans.</p>
<p>Heretofore, all members of the Royal family should be required to marry a full-blooded black African. It&rsquo;s the only way Auld Blighty can erase this foul racist stain.</p>

		<p>If this whiner was living in Japan, he would be griping that the Emperor there is an Asian.  The simple solution for this individual is to move to a country that is not a heridetary monarchy, or one that has a black hereditary monarch (but of course he won&rsquo;t be moving to Swaziland any time soon.)  It&rsquo;s much more fun, however for folks like these - and they seem increasingly common in nations neither they nor their ancestors had any part in creating - to complain.</p>

		<p>Since the British Crown actually wields little political power, the notion/argument for a non-Windsor/White monarch is nothing but a tactic aimed at changing the culture in the most fundamental and DETRIMENTAL way.</p>
<p>The poster who said that miscegenation is the most likely way in, is right. Let&rsquo;s hope that the Windsor line is proud enough of their heritage to resist this pressure, which is sure to mount.</p>
<p>The hopeful thing is that as ludicris and nationally insulting notions like Mr. Tatchell&rsquo;s are aired, more indigenous white Brits will begin to see the light. </p>

<p>I thought every single black person was meant to be descended from African kings and queens?<br>
In fact this reminds me of Yaphet Kotto (actor from original &#8216;Alien&rsquo; film) who claims that he is &#8220;the descendant of African kings and British royalty&#8221;.<br>
{snip}<br>
&#8220;According to Kotto, the queen&rsquo;s son Prince Albert Edward VII had an illicit affair with Princess Nakande, daughter of King Doualla Manga Bell&#8221;. <br>
{snip}<br>
To merit the reply from the palace&hellip;<br>
&#8220;Deputy press secretary to Queen Elizabeth categorically refuted the story claiming, &#8221; &hellip; Edward VII never visited Cameroon.&#8221; <br>

<p>The author of this discussion piece may be happy to know that thanks to Prince Albert II of Monaco&rsquo;s (dubbed the &#8216;Playboy Prince&rsquo;) indiscretion with a flight attendant from Togo.<br>
The Monaco royal now will learn that &#8220;once you go black you can never go back.&#8221;<br>
