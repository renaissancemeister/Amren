			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julie Bykowicz, Baltimore Sun, January 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Baltimore Mayor Sheila Dixon will resign next month, part of a plea deal reached Wednesday that brings a years-long corruption investigation to a close and ends the tenure of the city&rsquo;s first female mayor.</p>
<p>Dixon, 56, will be sentenced Feb. 4. Under the terms of the agreement, in which she added a guilty plea in a perjury case to last month&rsquo;s jury conviction for embezzlement, she will cease leading the city that day.</p>
<p>She may not hold any city or state position for at least two years. She is to perform 500 hours of community service and pay $45,000 to charity. None of her attorneys&rsquo; fees can be paid with public money. If she completes her probation within four years, her criminal record will be wiped clean.</p>
<p>She will probably be able to keep her $83,000 pension, which she would begin collecting the moment she steps down.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The first black woman elected to the City Council presidency, Dixon has been a public official for 23 years. She was raised in West Baltimore, where she still lives. She is twice divorced and has a daughter in college and a younger son.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The prosecutor, who has been investigating Dixon since March 2006, said that the mayor&rsquo;s defense team approached him about a week ago and that plea discussions began in earnest Monday.</p>
<p>Dixon&rsquo;s attorney, Arnold M. Weiner, said she agreed to the deal because she felt she would otherwise &#8220;be dragging the city and the people of the city behind her&#8221; through what could have been years of court battles. He also said Dixon&rsquo;s pension was a driving factor.</p>
<p>The agreed-upon sentence of &#8220;probation before judgment&#8221; in both cases, Weiner said, &#8220;was necessary for her to preserve the pension.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roselyn Spencer, head of the city&rsquo;s employee and elected officials retirement systems, said Dixon is eligible to begin collecting her annual pension immediately on stepping down.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That case, which was to go to trial in March, involved lavish presents from her former boyfriend, developer Ronald H. Lipscomb, in late 2003 and 2004 when she was City Council president. Dixon did not report the gifts, which included a $2,000 gift certificate to a local furrier, shopping sprees and pricey trips to Chicago, New York and Colorado, on her financial disclosure forms, a violation of law punishable by up to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>Dixon was indicted almost a year ago. Those charges were thrown out for technical reasons, and she was reindicted months later on one set of theft-related charges and a pair of perjury charges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As part of Wednesday&rsquo;s plea deal, the prosecutor will not pursue any criminal charges from his investigation of Dixon, and Dixon will not fight the jury conviction.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Plea deal allows disgraced black mayor to keep her pension.&#8221;</p>
<p>This kind of situation occurs with many white politicians as well:  They&rsquo;re ousted from office for malfeasance yet they can still get pension benefits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not right, but it&rsquo;s bound to come to an end in the very near future.  Governmental jurisdictions on any level just won&rsquo;t have the funds to pay them anymore as revenues shrink to very austere levels.  It&rsquo;s beggining to occur right now.</p>
<p>Many freebies will be on the chopping block for politicians, public servants and illegal aliens in the next two years.</p>
<p>Look for other states to go the way of California in the next fiscal period.  The money just won&rsquo;t be there to pay for all the excesses.</p>
<p>We are not in a recovery.  We are still in a severe economic downturn that has been in abeyance to some extent for a few months, but that is ending right now.  There&rsquo;s a new round of shocks coming soon.</p>

		<p>I remember watching D.W. Griffith&rsquo;s film &#8216;Birth of a Nation&rsquo; the first time when I was a kid.<br>
We laughed at the &#8216;racist&rsquo; scenes of blacks in the State Legislatures goofing around, drinking, just out for the &#8216;perks&rsquo;&hellip;<br>
We thought that was just &#8216;racist&rsquo; propaganda.<br>
Now I know better.  It&rsquo;s was the norm then, and it&rsquo;s reality now too.  </p>

		<p>Ranger has a valid point about the money not being there in the near future.  When government taxes us to pay politicians, what they are really doing is enslaving us.  They are stealing our labor in a sly and cunning way.  If the money is not there, they could achieve the same goal by drafting random citizens and forcing one of us to wash Dixon&rsquo;s car, another to cook her meals and yet another to mow her lawn.  &#8220;Money&#8221; is just an embodiment of our labor so, if it goes away, they might as well go straight for our labor and eliminate the deceptive medium. </p>

		<p>Everyone on the prosecution side seems to be going to great lengths to spare her from the sentence she deserves. She did not use as her defense that she forgot to report the &#8220;gifts.&#8221;. Instead, she lied right down the line. I would be more willing to grant her a pension if she first served a ten year sentence.</p>
<p>This case also goes to show that we no longer have the luxury to elect mayors of smaller cities based on their race. Too much rides on their decisions to allow corrupt but dim-witted people to run our cities. The costs to taxpayers is too high, both before and after their conviction/plea bargain goes through.</p>

		<p>About 25 years ago, I worked for a department within the Baltimore City government. </p>
<p>Someone with whom I worked (in the private sector) gave me a gift certificate to Hutzler&rsquo;s (no longer exists  &mdash;  was a nice department store)for $20 or $25 dollars. I mentioned this gift cert to my boss, who gave me some Baltimore City paperwork to fill out. If I recall correctly, the gift certificate was for the maximum allowed at the time&hellip;</p>
<p>I agree  &mdash;  Sheila the Shoe is skating into the sunset very nicely. Imagine, $80k pension. Mmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm. And Baltimore is still a third-world out-post.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Look for other states to go the way of California in the next fiscal period. The money just won&rsquo;t be there to pay for all the excesses.</p>
<p>We are not in a recovery&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, no kidding.  The jerks in the msm, to placate the proles and kulaks, continue to report that the bald-faced lie that &#8216;economy is improving&rsquo; and &#8216;the worst is behind us.&rsquo;  Don&rsquo;t believe it and prepare for economic chaos and anarchy when the entire fiat system collapses.</p>
<p>As for California, from today&rsquo;s news:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed an austere budget plan Friday for the coming fiscal year &hellip;To make up for a drastic drop in tax revenue and plug a $20 billion deficit, Schwarzenegger proposed making cuts to health and human services, welfare, transportation and environmental programs&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And then this inanity:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Schwarzenegger said the state is beginning to emerge from the downturn but that it would be three to four years before tax revenue recovers&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Tough times still lie ahead,&rsquo; he said&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask the governor exactly what proof he has that California&rsquo;s economy is &#8216;beginning to emerge from the downturn?&rsquo;</p>
<p>For decades now, taxpayers and productive businesses have been driven out of the state due to onerous regulations and exorbitant taxation.  Job-creating businesses are not coming back and the White tax base has been replaced with multi-generational, non-productive, immigrant welfare recipients.   </p>
<p>In fact, California&rsquo;s unemployment rate is 12.3% (probably closer to 17-20%), third highest in the nation.  Last year, &#8220;government workers took three furlough days a month, which cut their pay by 14 percent&#8221; and this year the government has &#8220;$3.1 billion less than last year to spend on government operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>How is this any indication that the &#8216;economy is beginning to emerge from the downturn?&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is the question:  How long before last year&rsquo;s demonstrations and protests become full scale riots?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Dixon has been a public official for 23 years. She was raised in West Baltimore, where she still lives. She is twice divorced and has a daughter in college and a younger son.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notice the invisible press political bias screaming out in the above article.</p>
<p>Nowhere among all the details given does Julie Bykowicz of the Baltimore Sun once mention that this corrupt and disgraced Mayor is a Democrat.</p>

<p>Further down, near the end of the article, it says, &#8220;Dixon will turn over power to City Council President, Stephanie Rawllings-Burke. Both are Democrats&#8221;.</p>
