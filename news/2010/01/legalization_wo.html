			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gary Martin, San Francisco Chronicle, January 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Legalizing the status of the roughly 12 million undocumented immigrants living in America would create jobs, increase wages and boost the sagging U.S. economy, according to a study released Thursday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Immigration has a positive effect on the economy,&#8221; Hinojosa-Ojeda [UCLA associate professor Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda, the study&rsquo;s author] told reporters, saying legalizing undocumented immigrants already in the United States could add $1.5 trillion to the gross domestic product over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, disagreed with the study&rsquo;s conclusions, saying, &#8220;Illegal immigrants take jobs from American workers. With 15 million Americans out of work, it&rsquo;s hard to believe that anyone would give amnesty to 12 million illegal immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study was released by the Center for American Progress and the Immigration Policy Center, groups that back legalization proposals.</p>

		<p>The idea that we need immigration to improve the economy is THE BIG LIE.  It is true that if you add people to a town it will &#8220;increase&#8221; the economy, simply because more people means more consumption, purchasing, energy use, etc. </p>
<p>However, increased population influences hundreds of things, and &#8220;the economy&#8221; is only one.  What about social tension &amp; balkanization, taxes, Third-World diseases, bankrupt hospitals, uninsured drivers, crime, increased competition for scarce resources, crowding, loss of natural areas and farm land, increased water &amp; air pollution, etc., etc.  Also, what about fairness?  It is against the law to enter the USA illegally.  Should everyone have the right to break the law whenever they &#8220;want a better life?  We have a very fair and legal system for immigration; why should these people go to the front of the line, simply because they ignored our laws?</p>
<p>Basing immigration on the economy is ridiculous?  Should we allow child prostitution and child labor, simply because it would improve the economy?  How about slavery, that would improve the economy, too.  </p>
<p>However, the very worst part about illegal immigration is that it actually harms the economy, because it lowers salaries and dramatically increases taxes and prices, such as real estate, as too many people compete for limited housing).<br/>

		<p>The distinguished professor is of course 100 percent correct.</p>
<p>However it is still an idiotic disingenuous argument. ANY increase in the population invariably grows the economy, except in the rarest cases. Every immigrant no matter how wretched and lazy must eat,  sleep somewhere, receive medical treatment, receive schooling etc.</p>
<p>This of course correspondent to a need for more food, housing, hospitals, schools etc. There is absolutely, positively, no doubt that this grows the economy. </p>
<p>The liberal economist Keynes pointed out if you wanted to, you could grow the economy simply by burying bottles of money in the earth which would spur private entrepreneurs to hire laborers to dig it up. Likewise we could import lets say the entire 10 million person population of somalia if we wanted. We&rsquo;d have jobs galore created for cops, social workers, welfare agency employees etc, wow look at all those jobs these unemployable Illiterate, Islamist Somalis &#8220;created&#8221;!</p>
<p>The real question is whether this insane, suicidal, mass immigration improves the STANDARD of living or at least the GDP per capita  &mdash;  which of course it doesn&rsquo;t as the immigrants will work for nothing driving down wages, exhaust public services, commit crime, drive down school standards etc.</p>
<p>Hence our our economy continues to soar whilst our standard of living plummets to Calcutta levels.</p>

		<p>Adding Third World immigrants to your community increases the OVERALL economy, but lowers average (per person) income and standard of living. Hence, on an individual basis, citizens see a decline in thier personal standard of living, except for owners of companies who exploit the immnigrant wage-slaves by using them to replace higher-paid citizen workers. </p>

		<p>Trying to grow the economy with immigration is a Ponzi Scheme.  When will it end?  After a Billion immigrants?   10 Billion immigrants?  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lot quantity of people living next to you, but quality of life. Quality of life declines rapidly as you pack millions and millions of people into your city, town, or county.  </p>

		<p>Mr. Hinojosa-Ojeda is a racist imperialist and only cares about imperialist America. Does he not realise that sending the illegals back will boost the Mexican economy? The U.S.A, Canada, Russia, New-Zealand, Australia and Europe can raise Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent out of poverty by sending all the immigrants (legal and illegal) back and thus boosting their economies. I am sure an all-White Europe will be impoverished as a result, but that is what evil Whiteys deserve.</p>

		<p>Basic economics tells us that the only relevant metric regarding national prosperity is productivity per head.The plain fact is that unless immigrants to a particular nation exceed the natives in terms of output per head, then the immigrants actually make that nation poorer, no ifs, buts or maybes about it, it&rsquo;s a simple mathematical division.</p>

		<p>Aside from the great points already made about how the contention is false, one must remember that man does not live on bread alone.  There are sometimes more important factors to having a desirable and livable society than the raw number GDP of its economy.</p>
<p>6 Jasper:</p>
<p>You have a great point.  If all these Hispanics and Indoamericans make America and Canada stronger, then they would also make Mexico and Guatemala stronger.  Best not to be racist and stockpile these dynamic and intellectual people for ourselves, we should share them with their native and kinfolk countries.</p>

		<p>This is a bold face lie. Let us suppose that the race-replacement of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS occurs. NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS are reduced to an ever dwinidlinig racial minority within the borders of AMERICA. Suppose that the &#8220;US: military and police departments are all nonwhite. What is the probability that an asian,hispanic or muslim academic economist will release an econmetric study for the Center for American Progress claiming that a massive increase in European immigration to &#8220;America&#8221; and a masive increase in Native White fertility would boost significantly economic activity in &#8220;America&#8221;. WE all know the answer to this question. Nonwhites all know the answer:0</p>
<p>This study is another example of the vicious race war that post-1965 nonwhites are waging against NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s all this about &#8220;12 million illegal immigrants&#8221;?<br/>
For about a decade, and until three or four years ago, the figure given by the MSM was always &#8220;11 million.&#8221; Now it&rsquo;s &#8220;12 million.&#8221;<br/>
In the meantime, we&rsquo;re told that between two and four million enter the U.S. illegally each year and this has been true for decades.<br/>
Would &#8220;40 million&#8221; be a more accurate figure?</p>

		<p>Folks, it&rsquo;s simple mathematics.  They say 12 million illegals.  That was the number they claimed TEN years ago.  It is at least double that now.  Perhaps even triple that given the decade of open borders and no enforcement.  So, conservatively, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s 24 million illegals.  Here&rsquo;s the point.  What is the usual stated difference between national elections as to Democratic voting folks, and Independent voting folks?  Gee.  About 24 million.  Remember, in general, only about 50 percent of people actually get out and vote in normal times unless a hot button issue is at stake.  That instant, magic, 24 million Democratic votes created with amnesty ENSURES that the Dems remain in power forever, and THAT is the simple point of all this talk of legalizing criminals in prisons, and criminals who illegally entered our country.  Period.  It&rsquo;s about ensuring Democratic/Liberal power in perpetuity.  WHY do you think there are  more LEGAL immigrants are coming from Third World Countries rather than White European Countries?  Lately, for the last decade. LEGAL immigrants are coming from BLACK African countries, and illegal immigrants are coming for LATIN AMERICAN countries.  Those are all assumed, rightly, to be votes for Democratic Liberal power.</p>

		<p>This has nothing to do with economics.  This is simply another salvo in the undeclared war on the United States and it&rsquo;s white population.  Population growth does not bring prosperity. Mexico has a high population growth rate.  Mexico has a huge illiterate peasant population yet is desperately poor and an obviously failed society.</p>
<p>Again, if overpopulation by illiterate peasants was THE key to prosperity then India would be the wealthiest nation on earth with no poverty.  Now, some will say &#8220;look, India&rsquo;s economy is booming&#8221;.  A large part of India&rsquo;s economic growth is based on the transfer of jobs from the west to India as well as the transfer of western technology. The major difference between the Mexicans and the Indians is that Indians have a naturally higher IQ, on average, than Mexican mestizos and thus are able to make good use of our technology.<br/>

		<p>More people may contribute to a higher GDP, but if the people are from a lower economic class the GDP per capita will be lower. If we want more immigrants, it would be people who will raise the general level of the country, and cause the GDP to be higher per capita. The vast majority of the people coming here illegally, and that is Mexicans, do not meet the criteria for improving the economy.</p>
<p>The professor seems to be an overly educated nincompoop who can&rsquo;t see the forest for the trees.</p>

<p>That only holds true for the higher I.Q upper/ middle caste minorities in India. They are the ones who have driven the economy so far. Wait till the much lower IQ average Indians start entering the system, the mestizos will look smarter then. This is from someone who has stayed in India for a while. There is no way India can keep pace with China (it still cannot right now). In the long term they will fall behind.</p>

		<p>Without post 1965 hispanics,muslims,asians an africans, the Democratic party could not get elected. The Democratic party is waging a vicious race war against NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. For example, upper-class spoiled brat Howard Dean has said publicly on more than one occasion that the Republican party is too WHITE.</p>
<p>As far as the economic issue goes, the experiment has already been performed. After WW2 when there was 0 non-white immigration and  the economy was booming. Economist called this the &#8220;Golden Age of Economic Growth&#8221;. I&#8221;m reading a book on this right now. The real wage was rapidly increasing. After 1973,eight years after the race-replacing nation destroying 1965 immigration reform act, economic growth slowed down and the real wage started to decline&hellip;and race-replacement of the majority NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN population began.</p>

		<p>The research is fundamentally flawed. It is only a means to support a policy of immigration without limits. If all further immigration were stopped now,we would still be unable to sustain the burden that illegals and legals cause taxpayers. There are simply not enough taxpayers to support all these leeches.</p>

		<p>Dr. Borjas, a noted and admired economist at Harvard, who is also Cuban by descent, has written numerous articles/books on the myth of high immigration numbers being beneficial to this country.  The literature additionally states that the added 100 million to this population since the &#8216;60&rsquo;s has only benefited/added to the GDP by about 0.5%.  Why isn&rsquo;t the MSM quoting these other economists who find just the opposite in their research than what the open-borders advocates do?  (Because they support it as well&hellip;!)</p>

		<p>Legalizing 30 million criminal illegal aliens would BOOST the economy? How?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already subsidizing them to the cost of $100 billion a year for free healthcare (E.R. visits), food stamps, welfare checks. Does anyone really think illegals can&rsquo;t get welfare without documentation? If they can get jobs, they sure as hell can use the same fake documentation along with an appropriate sob-story to get welfare checks and food stamps.</p>
<p>Illegal aliens defaulting on mortgages they knew they couldn&rsquo;t carry was a substantial factor in the banking melt-down of a year and a half ago.</p>
<p>Get rid of illegals, offer a fair wage and put Americans to work. That would help the economy.</p>

		<p>The only thing legalizing the illegals will do is create more welfare and social service programs for their use.  If that is what the author means by creating jobs and improving the economy than he is surely mistaken.  Not only will it not improve the economy it will bankrupt what social programs are now available for American citizens.</p>

<p>Forget about George Borjas. His research was used to justify the last major amnesty which created a nmassive hispanic voting block that is voting for the race-replacement of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS.</p>
<p>By the way,thirteen years ago, in the Journal of Economic Issues, George Borjas argued that  all of the economic studies on the costs of post-1965 immigration are worthless. Not worth the paper they were printed on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the foolishness of some people  who write &#8220;according to George Borjas&hellip;&#8221;. Who cares what some economist or sociologist-Putnam- for example-</p>
<p> says. NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS have known the true facts about LEGAL IMMIGRATION for years. WE do not need the approval of George Borjas-a hispnic LEGAL IMMIGRANT FROM CUBA-to oppose immigration.</p>
<p>NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS-millions of them-know the true facts from personal experience. I wouldn&rsquo;t put the fate of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS in George Borjas hands&hellip;or any other cuban from cuban ocuppied miami for that matter.</p>

		<p>Can Odumbo and his Cabinet lucidly expolain WHY we should continue our asinine open border policy when jobs are being lost at a prodiguous rate monthly? Is our government&rsquo;s secret agenda to DESTROY our nation? Make it a puppet vassal of China and/or other countries?</p>

&#8220;The distinguished professor is of course 100 percent correct.</p>
<p>However it is still an idiotic disingenuous argument. ANY increase in the population invariably grows the economy,except in the rarest cases. Every immigrant no matter how wretched and lazy must eat, sleep somewhere, receive medical treatment, receive schooling etc.</p>
<p>This of course correspondent to a need for more food, housing, hospitals, schools etc. There is absolutely, positively, no doubt that this grows the economy. <br/>
 &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>No it doesn&rsquo;t.  All the needs and services you list here are ones that require taxes for redistributing funds for all the numbers of people who can&rsquo;t find work or enough work. There is always a fluncuation in the amount of jobs available.  In hard times, more unemployed requiring tax supported services hurt the economy because they don&rsquo;t really produce anything.  Even in a booming economy, more jobs may be available, but if they are not good paying, they and their families still require the welfare system, hospitals, etc. Populations, even when they are native are less wealthy as individuals as their numbers increase.  The U.S. hasn&rsquo;t got enought wealth to make every individual in China or India wealthy, let alone ourselves.</p>
<p>Kenelm Digby is right; it is simple math.  All this professor sees is the little stores and restaurants, and MONEY TRANSFER SHOPS, etc., that an immigrant community brings with it.  But the capital comes from a the host country and that amount of money is based on the GDP of that country.  That means actual value of goods produced, not services required from various bureaus funded by more subtractions from that wealth.  </p>
<p>When we are surrounded by minds that shortcircuit logic, we are witnessing national and cultural collapse, even if it is among our own race.</p>
