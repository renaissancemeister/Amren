<h1>Canada May Fast-Track Haitian Immigration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBC News, January 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Canadian government says it is looking into a plan to help fast-track immigration from Haiti in the wake of the earthquake that has crippled the Caribbean country.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Thursday he and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney have been discussing ways to ease immigration and refugee rules to allow more Haitians into Canada quickly.</p>
<p>Opening up the process &#8220;will be something the government will be addressing in the next couple of days,&#8221; he said while stopping at the Ottawa Red Cross office to make a donation.</p>
<p>The first three military air transports arrived in Montreal from Haiti early Friday morning, carrying 272 evacuees who had been selected by staff at the Canadian Embassy for transport, Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said Friday.</p>
<p>The latest Canadian consular information has confirmed four Canadians have died, 13 are reported injured and an additional 550 have been located, Cannon said. About 1,415 Canadians living in the affected area are still missing, he said.</p>
<p>About 6,000 Canadian citizens live in Haiti, but only 700 were registered with the embassy in Port-au-Prince, Cannon said.</p>
<p>The Canadian Embassy has continued to be a refuge for citizens, however, and many are being sent to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic for transport back to Canada.</p>
<p>But as the situation for people in Haiti worsens, the government is expected to look at a plan that would allow Haitians with Canadian relatives to also come to Canada.</p>
<p>Chantal Barratteau, a Haitian community organizer in Montreal, says deciding who can come and who can stay will be a difficult task.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you choose who to bring here?&#8221; she asks. &#8220;I mean if I could choose, I would bring my family if they are hurt, and then my neighbours, and then my family&rsquo;s friends and so on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thousands of Haitians spent another night outside following the 7.0- magnitude quake that hit the country this week. Many won&rsquo;t return to their homes, fearing that continuing aftershocks will knock down already weakened structures.</p>
<p><b>Visa changes allow for refuelling</b></p>
<p>Thousands of homes have been destroyed or damaged, and at least 300,000 people are estimated to be homeless.</p>
<p>Kenney has already announced a loosening of rules for Haitian nationals travelling through Canada on board non-commercial flights, allowing aid transports from other countries to stop in Canada for refuelling without requiring passengers to acquire visas for temporary residency.</p>
<p>A Chinese transport that landed in Vancouver and a Russian flight that stopped in Gander, N.L., were the first two planes to take advantage of these rule changes to quickly refuel, Cannon said Friday.<br>

		<p>&#8220;<i>About 6,000 Canadian citizens live in Haiti, but only 700 were registered with the embassy in Port-au-Prince, Cannon said.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Most likely the majority of those 6,000 <i>&#8220;Canadian&#8221;</i> citizens are actually former Haitians visiting their real homeland during our Canadian winter months.</p>
<p>Furthermore, wouldn&rsquo;t these newly displaced Haitians be better suited to being rescued by their own neighbouring Caribbean countries other than Canada whose culture, traditions and weather are entirely unlike those of Haiti? </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a rhetorical question, but the intended action to fast-track Haitians through our immigration process was surely prompted in sympathy to none other than Canada&rsquo;s prestigious title-holder, the Haitian-born immigrant Governor-General Michaelle Jean.</p>

		<p>With respect to Haitian immigration to Canada, it must be recalled that the Francophiles in Quebec have been permitting Haitians to take up residency in that province for several years solely upon the basis that they speak French.</p>
<p>Former US Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan once commented upon the language preferences of the Haitians, but his remarks would be censured today.  </p>

<p>SKIP the psychic predicts&hellip;&hellip;.no way are any of these Haitians EVER gonna leave the welfare teat of Canada nor are those on the U.S. welfare teat&hellip;we are now stuck with them and their crime. In fact, I further predict&hellip;..massive family chain migration, but of course, we all know that follows!</p>

		<p>Even the country Haiti shares a border with, the Dominican Republic doesn&rsquo;t want any Haitian immigrants. They&rsquo;ve had their experiences with Haitian lawlessnes along their border, not to mention the haitian invasion of 1822.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I imagine arriving in Montreal, in mid-January, from balmy Haiti, will be a real shock to the Haitians! </p>
<p>Ah, well. Who cares about them?  This is about diversity. Everything must be sacrificed for that goal. A little suffering doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Surely this disaster is a godsend to the diversitarians. It is a divine answer to their prayers.  They couldn&rsquo;t have hoped for better luck. Given the circumstances, nobody will dare resist or argue with them now.  Canada&rsquo;s gates will be opened wide.  And its purse.  For many Haitians, the disaster will have proved a blessing in disguise.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Only educated Haitians speak (real) French. And not many Haitians are educated.  The rest speak an Africanized patois which they fancy to call &#8220;Creole&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s even written differently than French. You would not recognize it. <br>
 <br>
Since the Quebecois themselves speak an archaic variety of French which draws smiles and puzzlement in France, I wonder if they can even understand the Haitians.  I suspect not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar to the difference between Standard English and Jamaican pidgin   &mdash;   but more so.   I once was seated in the library and near me were some young black men, conversing in a strange, utterly unrecognizable language. I simply couldn&rsquo;t figure it out or place it in any known language group.  I guessed it was some African tongue.  Since I am interested in languages, I finally yielded to curiosity and  asked them what foreign language they were speaking.  They said (suddenly  speaking normally), &#8220;We&rsquo;re speaking English&#8221;.   No one would ever have guessed it!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s one good reason for contributing not a single dime to any Haitian charity: ALL of us in the West will be paying for this earthquake, for many years to come, whether we want to or not.</p>

		<p>If Cuba is such a workers&rsquo; paradise under the Castro dynasty (as it were), why don&rsquo;t the Haitians go there instead, instead of trying to pry off a piece of largesse from white society? </p>
<p>Because they know that our society generates the most wealth, for reasons that Haiti will never be able to emulate.</p>

		<p>I can see it now: an increase in crimes such as theft, rape, drug dealing, drug smuggling, pimping, and the like. I can see overburdened schools trying to teach illiterate children. I can see an increase in AIDS and HIV infections. I can see my tax dollars increase to support the ever-growing welfare roles. I can see outbreaks of hepatitis and other diseases. I can see the torture and killing of innocent animals for some religious practices. I can see so many negative possibilities of accepting Haitians to my country I wonder why can&rsquo;t my government?</p>
<p>By the way&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Since the Quebecois themselves speak an archaic variety of French which draws smiles and puzzlement in France&hellip;</em></p>
<p>This simply isn&rsquo;t true. While the accents, some terms, and some pronounciations may differ between Quebecois French and European French the language is the same. Quebecois French isn&rsquo;t archaic or pidgin. I studied French in highschool and at university and can understand French speakers from both areas. Look at all the different accents and colloquialisms in English. Americans call a wool cap a beanie, the British refer to them as watch caps, and Canadians call them toques.</p>
