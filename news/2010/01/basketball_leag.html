<h1><a href="https://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2010/01/19/nba_563760.shtml">Basketball League for White Americans Targets Augusta</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Billy Byler, Augusta Chronicle, January 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new professional basketball league boasting rosters made up exclusively of white Americans has its eyes set on Augusta, but the team isn&rsquo;t receiving a warm welcome.</p>
<p>The All-American Basketball Alliance announced in a news release Sunday evening that it intends to start its inaugural season in June and hopes Augusta will be one of 12 cities with a team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only players that are natural born United States citizens with both parents of Caucasian race are eligible to play in the league,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>Augusta Mayor Deke Copenhaver, who has publicly expressed his support for minor league teams in the past, said he would not do the same for this team.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Don &#8220;Moose&#8221; Lewis, the commissioner of the AABA, said the reasoning behind the league&rsquo;s roster restrictions is not racism.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s nothing hatred about what we&rsquo;re doing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t hate anyone of color. But people of white, American-born citizens are in the minority now. Here&rsquo;s a league for white players to play fundamental basketball, which they like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lewis said he wants to emphasize fundamental basketball instead of &#8220;street-ball&#8221; played by &#8220;people of color.&#8221; He pointed out recent incidents in the NBA, including Gilbert Arenas&rsquo; indefinite suspension after bringing guns into the Washington Wizards locker room, as examples of fans&rsquo; dissatisfaction with the way current professional sports are run.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you want to go to the game and worry about a player flipping you off or attacking you in the stands or grabbing their crotch?&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s the culture today, and in a free country we should have the right to move ourselves in a better direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Atlanta-based league, which will operate as a single-entity owning all of its teams, is looking for local contacts to pay $10,000 to become a &#8220;licensee&#8221; in one of 12 cities throughout the Southeast. Lewis said he has already received threats from people opposed to the roster restrictions and several cities have told him to stay out of town. Lewis said he has yet to hear from any one in Augusta.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;People will come out and support a product they can identify with. I&rsquo;m the spoken minority right now, but if people will give us a chance, it&rsquo;ll work.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The white game of basketball, which is essentially a fundamental game, works.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed. All-white teams from Europe and South American usually beat all-black teams from the U.S. in international play.</p>
<p>We have some all-black and almost all-black teams in the NBA. Why are people not up in arms about this? White are obviously being held to a different standard by the racist NBA. All we want/need is a fair chance.</p>

		<p>In other words, basketball like it used to be before forced integration and the ESPN highlightreelization of everything athletic.  </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if this league will succeed, but we do know for sure that:</p>
<p>(1)  Technical fouls will be as rare on teeth on hens</p>
<p>(2)  So will hanging-off-the-rims slam dunks</p>
<p>(3)  Shooting percentages will be over 50%</p>
<p>(4)  Free throw percentages will be over 70%</p>
<p>(5)  Uniform shorts won&rsquo;t extend down to almost the player&rsquo;s ankle</p>
<p>(6)  No black gang thugs will wear AABA uniforms or periphenelia to allude to gang membership or &#8220;throwing in with set&#8221;</p>
<p>(7)  No booming hip-hop or rap music in the locker room.</p>
<p>(8)  None of its players will get looks from NBA teams, even though they would be more than qualified.<br>

		<p>I used to love basketball back when Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Danny Ainge were winning championships for the Boston Celtics. I haven&rsquo;t watched a game since the three of them retired from the court.<br>
I would love to watch all-white teams playing their hearts out against each other, just like in the old days.<br>
These cities would be fools to turn them down</p>

<p>New Orleans stopped all-white crews by claiming that they the used &#8220;public&#8221; streets and were therefore a &#8220;public accommodation&#8221;.<br>

		<p>I would love to coach in this league! I think alot of people would support this . This would really take off. I would like to see the same idea with football too. I am tired of watching thugs and inferior athletes who can&rsquo;t catch footballs or who can&rsquo;t tackle right.</p>

<p>Received threats, eh?  And these nimwits that were quoted talked about prejudice, hate and inclusiveness?  I wonder what they call receiving threats, just because people have a different point of view?</p>
<p>Count me as a supporter.  I too would love to see white teams playing.  The game has evolved into a farce where black freaks take turns runing back and forth slam dunking the basketball, instead of using a game strategy to outwit the opponent.  I haven&rsquo;t watched basketball for quite a long time, because of the moronic lack of strategy.</p>
<p>Too, I would bar anyone 7&rsquo; tall from playing, capping the height restriction to say, 6&rsquo; 4&#8221;, or 6&rsquo;5&#8221;.  Right now whoever has the tallest freak has the advantage, instead of the team with the best winning strategy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely a market for this league.  If these people are successful in getting started I think they&rsquo;ll make a lot of money, and the crying and whining will be non-stop.<br>

		<p>If you want to make basketball a White game again, all you have to do is raise the goal to 20 feet in order to eliminate dunking and layups.  Raising the goal would require shooting precision, arm strength and strategy, and eliminate the current situation where a team can dominate by simple virtue of having a player particularly adept at stuffing the ball through the hoop.</p>
<p>Since the days arrived when men could jump high enough to poke the ball into the hole, professional basketball has been one of the most moronic exercises in idiocy ever to hit the national stage.  One might as well pay $250 for a ticket to visit Taco Bell and watch the workers lumber around the dining room artistically stuffing wadded-up trash into the trashcans.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s if, and I stress the IF, someone wants to watch people be paid to play a kid&rsquo;s game in the first place.  It would be far, FAR better for us all if every community lined their gyms with goals for half-court ball, and let ordinary people come in and play after work.  </p>
<p>Games are for playing, not for watching.  Forgetting that one simple fact has wrought havoc on our culture, and helped advance multiculturalism.</p>

		<p>The fundamental issue here is freedom.  At present, whites are clearly denied freedom of association, at least in some instances (such as this one).  </p>
<p>It is one thing to be disinclined to support such segregated activities, but quite another <br>
to threaten those who wish to.  </p>
<p>Though I have not been interested in most sports, particularly at the professional level, <br>
for many years now, I would love to see an &#8220;All-American Basketball&#8221;  league.  It would provide a refreshing alternative to the (nearly) All-African league we already have. </p>

The all white teams are a great idea ad would be highly profitable except for our government.  If America were a free enterprise nation that league would soon run the NBA out of business.  That is unless the NBA countered with more whites giving the people the product it wants.</p>
<p>But government restrictions will never allow the league to get of the ground.  It will have no place to play, its players, coaches, and owners will  be harassed by every governmental agency from the AFD to the IRS.  No TV coverage will per FCC order.  All this to prevent white people from enjoying themselves.  </p>
<p>I have often wished for a league like this because I like basketball but can&rsquo;t watch the NBA ugly players.  </p>
<p>I also think that an all white Suburban Globetrotters that &ldquo;played&rdquo; against and always beat a black team, while making the blacks look foolish, would be a big success.  Professional Wrestling makes money, why not me with the Suburban Globetrotters?    Again government restrictions and no doubt mentally deranged anti-white protesters would destroy the team.<br>

		<p>Great idea, but racism is the cry already before anything even gets a fair hearing.  I have been proposing this to my in-laws for some time.  I grew up in southern Indiana and played varsity HS basketball, with no great talent, but I love the game.  I am sad that both a) hardly any white guys are now in the professional game and b) the &lsquo;street game&rsquo; is entirely muscle and monster dunks, with hardly any finesse.  <br>
I would favor not only a white game (or no more than 12% black) but an affordable game for the fans.  Making the game affordable would probably require limiting player and coach salaries to say $250K and use of existing pro or college facilities.  Further, let us have rules of: i) hands off the rims, ii) strict calling of fouls for both defensive and offensive contact (collisions), iii) suspensions for fighting and iv) longer shot time clocks and perhaps a four point goal.  To some extent this returns the game to a civilized game and one that most people can afford to attend.<br>

<p>There is a lot of merit to this idea. A league for whites would give talented whites a lot of playing time at a higher level, something they cannot get now. White foreign players do well in the NBA because of all the playing time they get in foreign leagues, raising their skills, something a white player in America cannot do, NO consequential playing time.</p>

		<p> Seems to me like the NBA is all-black in all but name. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we Whites have our own league, too? And yes, it WOULD be refreshing to see basketball played in the classic style again, instead of the run-and-gun, in-your-face, travel ten steps and then do a King Kong slam dunk style prevalent in the NBA nowadays.</p>

		<p>As much as I would love to see the AABA get their rights to choose whoever they wish on their roster, call me conditioned from all the years of seeing only blacks on ball teams, I simply just cant stand basketball&hellip; and I live in NC! I know some of you will disagree with me but it will always be a &#8220;black sport&#8221; in my eyes, and thats sad that I think that way but I do. Blacks have simply takin&rsquo; over that sport.</p>
<p>I am 20 years old and play a low impact activity called discgolf because I am just not that into sports. One of the main reasons I picked up on it is because those who partake in this past-time are 95% Caucasian. When you put that into the equation you dont have to worry about: deadly assaults, robberies, shootings, TNB.</p>

		<p>Look at teams like Duke.  They are mostly white but consistently win the championships.  Basketball is a game of strategy and skill, not of rim hanging and gravity defying antics.  A white or mostly white team will consistently beat all or mostly black teams.  </p>

<p>We could add #9 with reasonable certainty, that guns won&rsquo;t be carried in the locker room. Armed officers may be needed though to protect the players from blacks seeing whites usurp &#8220;their&#8221; game.</p>

		<p>A slight modification might make the league easier to accept.  There could be teams of all whites, all blacks, all Asians, etc.  Surely there would be a market among Asians and Hispanics, along with American whites, to support their &#8216;own&rsquo; teams rather than just the occasional Yao Ming or Tyler Hansbrough. </p>

		<p>This is great!!! Definitely the way to go, here in South-Africa we have a private school group, BCVO that gives Christian White Education +- 40 Schools, anyway they started a regional and national sport competition(athletics,hockey,rugby) called &#8220;bokkies-sport&#8221;, it is going from strength to strength as Afrikaners in other schools can also participate. In America it will be hard at first, but many times the difference between radical and mainstream is just number of years an institution exists.</p>

		<p>I totally agree with Roger Z on this.I used to love basketball when I was a kid back in the 60s.Then the boxer Cashius Clay changed his name to &#8216;Mohamed Ali&rsquo;. That seems to be the turning point.The black gloved raised fist at the olympics. Lew Alcinder became &#8216;Kareem Abdul Jabar&rsquo;. From there it was a steady downhill slide.I stopped watching basketball alltogether when it became unsafe to take my family to even see a game. Now most players are nothing more than gang members in uniform. Bling bling wearin&rsquo; baggy pants draggin&rsquo; gold teeth havin&rsquo; escalade rollin&rsquo; glock slingin&rsquo; thugs that ESPN and other sports entities put on pedastals. Great role models for Americas kids huh?&hellip;&hellip;.teach your children well&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

		<p>I would support such a concept.  I also no longer watch most sports because I cannot identify with the cultural attitudes displayed by non-white athletes.  Hispanic athletes are usually more like white athletes in composure, so no major problem there.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all that chest-bumping, posturing and vulgarity from the africans that makes me shy away.  And yes, I no longer use the term african-american to describe black people.  Now I call them africans, for that is what they focus on.  </p>
<p>When I first saw the headline here it made me realize that - outside of hockey or tennis - you never see any sports games in the media with a preponderance of whites.  (Although the williams sisters dominate coverage in tennis and tiger - well I think his white ex-wife bashed him up good with that club.)</p>
<p>I cannot remember - outside of hockey, equestrian, golf or tennis - the last time I saw a large group of whites playing a sport.  I have never seen an all-white basketball or football team play outside of my high school experience.</p>
<p>Whites do tend to follow the rules more in games and play with strategy and finesse.  My fear would be that some of the white players would come in alrady infected with that black machismo and trash talk and sport gawdy piercings and tattoos.</p>
<p>If such an all-white league formed, though, I would watch it and support it.  It would make basketball safe for white people from decent homes again.  I myself have done everything in my power to discourage my own children from showing any interest in basketball for the simple reason that every kid in this large urban area who is into basketball is also into the gangsta rap/hip hop thug lifestyle.</p>
<p>My kids like ice skating, thank God - a nice, very, very American sport with no chance of going rogue.</p>

We&rsquo;re too far gone and their aren&rsquo;t enough lambs willing to act like wolves to stand up and say, &#8220;this is a free country and we are free people so we can have this league&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t waste your time here debating and commenting about the theories of it, just support the team. Send them money and show support for what they are doing.The proof of our dedication to advancing white americans stands in our ability to publicly support ourselves. </p>

		<p>Thank you Mr. Lewis, for demonstrating absurdity with absurdity.  The reaction to your imaginary league was met with the predictable, &#8216;get your sheet&rsquo; and &#8216;cross burning&rsquo; reaction from the &#8216;enlightened&rsquo; masses.  Most Whites now see anything that is specific to their race as &#8216;racist,&rsquo; while they proudly accept and support anything that is clearly non-White.  They have clearly abandoned any allegiance to their race.  Never before in the history of man have so many given-up so much, to such an undeserving few.  Your grandchildren will curse your memory.  </p>

		<p>One has to know the diversity freaks/liberal media would never allow such a league. A better strategy would have been to create a league and never mention race. Then simply fill their rosters with whites only. What could the freaks say then? Are there no all black professional basketball teams?</p>
<p>Still, the protesting and howling would be non stop if this league were formed. It would be front page news for years. The screams of racism would be incessant. The pot bangers would sneak pots into these games and show their intelligence and rhyming talents. ALL of our &#8220;leaders&#8221; from the president on down would wring their hands and show incredible concern. The congress would work overtime to pass legislation to ban this and any future, similar leagues. There WOULD be violence. And THIS, IMO would be a best case scenario.</p>

		<p>We must ask ourselves, if an all-White basketball league becomes an accepted idea, what&rsquo;s next?  An all-black college fund?  An all-black beauty pageant?  An all-black TV network?  </p>

<p>&#8220;Too, i would bar anyone 7&rsquo; tall from playing, capping the height restriction to say, 6&rsquo;4, or 6&rsquo;5. Right now whoever has the tallest freaks has the advantage, instead of the team with the best winning strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Great point. About twenty years ago, former NBA great Bob Cousy, wanted to start a new pro league with players who were 6&rsquo;4 and under. You would then see some definet talent in such a league. </p>
<p>I wonder what happned to his idea?</p>

		<p>Some of the best &#8220;fundamental basketball&#8221; players, for example Steve Nash, are excluded by the arbitrary requirement to be a natural born US citizen, suggesting that this isn&rsquo;t just about the style of basketball.</p>

		<p>Sounds good to me. I wonder if this could be done as an internet league and the games broadcast via a site like hulu. A way you could make it all white (or white and asian) are to include the following rules. No tattoo&rsquo;s, no entry into the league if you have illegitimate children (unless you marry the mother), and no felonies. (Real felonies like grand theft auto, not stupid stuff like being caught at school with a pen knife in your car when you are 17).    </p>
<p>Even though it is not all white, I enjoy minor league baseball. You generally don&rsquo;t have the level of stupidity that one sees with football and basketball. </p>
<p>When they get a little older, I am going to encourage my kids to go into swimming. It is still predominantly white. </p>

		<p>After watching the black basketball player, Latrell Sprewell, choke his coach, PJ Carlesimo, I had no desire to watch basketball again. </p>
<p>I feel the all white league is a fantastic idea. </p>

		<p>This was from the original article:</p>
<p><i>Clint Bryant, athletic director at Augusta State University, laughed when he heard the news.  &#8220;It&rsquo;s so absurd, it&rsquo;s funny, but it gives you an idea of the sickness of our society&#8221; he said. &#8220;It shows you what lengths people will go to just to be mean-spirited. I think at any basketball level, no matter if it&rsquo;s all black, all white, all Hispanic, all Asian or anyone else, the players should just be a basketball team.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>To give him a little bit of credit:</p>
<p>https://www.aug.edu/athletics/sports/mbasketball.htm</p>
<p>Four of the 14 members of the 2009-10 men&rsquo;s basketball team are white, but none seem to be Hispanic are Asian.  However, many big time programs are lucky to have one white on the roster.  And many of them don&rsquo;t have any white starters.  </p>

		<p>The idea can work if the US teams play mainly against European and Asian teams.  It already works at the Olympics.</p>

		<p>During the 1922 and 1923 seasons the NFL featured the all-Native American Oorang Indians of LaRue, Ohio.  Oorang was the name of the dog kennel which the team&rsquo;s owner promoted through his NFL team.  The halftime show included dog acrobatics with members of the team assisting.  Players belong to several different tribes and their most famous player was Jim Thorpe.</p>
<p>Guadalajara Chivas (the Jumping Goats) of the top level of Mexican professional soccer only fields native-born Mexican players.  No naturalized citizens.  Chivas is consistently one of Mexico&rsquo;s best and most popular teams and is currently ranked in the top 100 of professional teams worldwide. </p>
<p>During its first year in America&rsquo;s Major League Soccer Chivas USA only had Mexican players.</p>
<p>Effective marketing, not mean-spiritedness.   </p>
