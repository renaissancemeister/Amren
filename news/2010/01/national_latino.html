		<p>Of course there are no comments on this. No protests - No threats. This Conference is okay to everyone, right? </p>
<p>Yet having a &#8220;European Heritage&#8221; conference in a COUNTRY made up for EUROPEAN People&rsquo;s is NOT OKAY? </p>
<p>Something is wrong. </p>

		<p>How come the Antifa hatemongers aren&rsquo;t protesting this conference? Because they are liberal cowards. We have the right to be proud. They should never intimidate us into inaction. Let&rsquo;s give them a fight!</p>

		<p>I knew the top issue at this conference would be amnesty, but check out the rest of their agenda:</p>
<p>-passing legislation to stop global warming [snicker]. The law will have no effect on the temperature but will hurt our economy.</p>
<p>-a taxpayer-funded &#8220;jobs program&#8221;</p>
<p>-a taxper-funded program to &#8220;save the homes&#8221; of Latinos and blacks who bought houses they couldn&rsquo;t afford w/subprime loans.</p>
<p>-a taxpayer-funded &#8220;bailout of Main Street&#8221; aka more stimulous welfare.</p>
<p>Their entire agenda appears to be to demand more handouts from white taxpayers. The worst lie in recent history has been the claim that Third World immigrants contribute more to society than they take out.</p>

<p>Exactly! This is the biggest myth today. It is the main reason why Whites allow their countries to be flooded with non-whites. People don&rsquo;t care about their heritage. The only thing they care about is wealth. So they allow immigrants in because they think they&rsquo;re good for the economy, even though all data shows they&rsquo;re not. We have to destroy this myth. This is the key to our success. I&rsquo;m surprised so very few people are talking about it. I listened to Mark Steyn&rsquo;s audio book America Alone and was very surprised that he too didn&rsquo;t write about this issue. So I sent him and e-mail and explained why I think he should talk about it. And I also included all the American Renaissance videos I could find on Youtube so he&rsquo;ll realize that it&rsquo;s not only Muslims who are a threat to western civilization. All low IQ people are.<br>
