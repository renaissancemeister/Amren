<h1>NAACP Sues US Airways, Accuses It of Discrimination</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stacey Burling, Philadelphia Inquirer, January 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The NAACP is accusing US Airways, in a lawsuit, of discriminating against African American employees by assigning them to less desirable gates and shifts and by giving work areas dominated by African American employees racially loaded nicknames such as &#8220;Compton,&#8221; &#8220;Camden,&#8221; and &#8220;The Ghetto.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shifts and areas with more white workers are called &#8220;Frankford,&#8221; &#8220;South Philly,&#8221; and &#8220;King of Prussia,&#8221; the suit says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Three former airline employees also brought the suit. One of them, Tiffany Salters, a customer-service manager, said she was told that she had to quit her position as secretary of the Camden County branch of the NAACP or lose her job at US Airways.</p>
<p>She felt she was &#8220;harassed&#8221; by managers because of her work with the NAACP, she said, and ultimately was fired in 2007 for a security lapse she said was not her responsibility.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Managers, Salters said, would refer to individual African American employees as being &#8220;ghetto&#8221; or &#8220;hood.&#8221; She said she was praised for her ability to get along with all sorts of customers. A manager told her she had the &#8220;complexion for the connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The suit seeks damages for all African American employees, reinstatement of the employees in the suit, an immediate ban on &#8220;racial code words,&#8221; and the appointment of a civil-rights monitor over US Airways&rsquo; Philadelphia operations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boda said assignments to gates were based purely on seniority. &#8220;You bid for whatever shift you want to work and where you want to work,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She said she did not know whether African American employees, as a group, had less seniority than whites. She also said she had not heard of the offending nicknames.</p>
<p>Mildenberg said that he had no statistics on the percentage of minority employees in different concourses, but that whites were more likely to staff international and business flights, while African Americans were more likely to be assigned to less desirable commuter flights.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, US Airways managers and employees called Terminal C &#8220;Compton&#8221; or &#8220;Camden.&#8221; Compton is a California city known for its violence.</p>

		<p> It&rsquo;s &#8220;Shake Down the White Folks&#8221; time again! The NAACP is making yet another reach into your pockets to benefit a group of its own, and, oh, yes, cause air fares to go higher if it wins this lawsuit.</p>
<p> The smartest thing US Airways could do is order its attorneys to find an excuse to counter-sue the NAACP (hey, did you ever hear of a good attorney who COULDN&rsquo;T find an escuse to sue somebody?) Every time the NAACP files one of these lawsuits, that&rsquo;s exactly what the defendant corporation should do. Even if the NAACP won every one of the counter suits, it would eventually bankrupt them, because under our judicial system there is no penalty for filing frivolous lawsuits. That result would be called, &#8220;Hoist on their own petard.&#8221;</p>

What never ceases to amaze me is that white employers and employees are clueless around blacks.</p>
<p>These people are just biding their time, waiting for an incident or provocation to file a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Said it before: if you work with blacks, have as little contact as possible and keep your mouth shut; and NEVER crack a joke. ANYTHING you say or do WILL be used against you.</p>

		<p>Same old song.  Blacks can&rsquo;t compete as a whole on the same level, so they are assigned the &#8220;less desirable&#8221; positions which in reality are the least demanding positions, so they at least can function.  Actually, they are being done a favor, most whites would just be fired for incompetence.  Then when it becomes obvious that they are being discriminated against, which they are and rightfully so, they complain and harass whites, which in turn provokes the whites to demean them openly, which is only a normal reaction when someone wants the same as you but can&rsquo;t earn it but still expects it.</p>
<p>I know why it is that the diversity lie continues, but the question is for how much longer, and how much more perverse will our society have to become until the inevitable terrible fullscale backlash or collapse. </p>

<p>My guess is that the black employees referred to their own work areas with these names.  In a PBS documentary about Berkeley HS in the 1990s, black students called their own click &#8220;Africa.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Just another spin on the &#8220;Ghetto Wheel Of Fortune&#8221;. And they wonder why nobody wants to hire them.</p>
<p>She felt she was &ldquo;harassed&rdquo; by managers because of her work with the NAACP.</p>
<p>No, BECAUSE Of her &#8220;work&#8221; with the NAACP, she probably came to work with a racial chip on her shoulder and was instructed by them to &#8220;create&#8221; a lawsuit for them to &#8220;settle&#8221;. Why doesn&rsquo;t anyone else see this scam???</p>

		<p>#3 sbuffalonative is right on the money about saying as little as possible around blacks. The less said the better. If you have to converse with them, try to be a neutral as possible. Talk about the ball game or the weather. </p>
<p>I seem to remember a lawsuit a few years ago that involved an episode of &#8220;Seinfeld&#8221;. This was between a white man and woman and I believe she was quite foul mouthed, but no one dared speak up lest they ruin their careers. I&rsquo;m of the opinion that the less people know about you at work, the better. </p>
<p>In the military one of the things you are evaluated on is your commitment to &#8220;equal opportunity&#8221;. Equal opportunity is fine, so long as the person is competent to do the job. Outside of a few elite communities where you must have the capacity and earn the privilege of being there, you would be amazed how many senior personnel tiptoe around minorities so that they don&rsquo;t get dinged on EO. It is a career killer. The white servicemen who grew up in proximity to minorities tend to be a little better at not saying stupid things. The ones from Maine, Oregon, or Minnesota (at least when I first joined), were in for a rude awakening. </p>
<p>You might have a few minorities on a sub and if you are a screw up in submarine service, you can get booted back to the surface Navy. Even the cooks tend to be brighter than average in the &#8220;silent service&#8221;. The surface Navy is a different story. Yes, you do have very bright and competent personnel, but you have a fair number of incompetents. If one of those is a minority, you better have all the i&rsquo;s dotted and the t&rsquo;s crossed and a mountain of paperwork if you wish to take action again this individual. </p>
<p>You hope this clown will foul up out in town, get popped for drugs, or something else that will make your life easier. Then JAG or the local PD gets involved and it is no longer in your hands. You walk away free and clear and have dodged that EO bullet. We had one of those at my first command. He finally got the boot after the new CO pulled a surprise urinalysis on everyone. But this knucklehead couldn&rsquo;t scream discrimination since EVERYONE had to participate. He also had a page 13 (administrative remark) in his service record for prior drug use. That was his freebie (which was allowed in the 1980&rsquo;s). </p>
<p>The following is the best link I could find to a story called &#8220;Flakes in the Service&#8221; by David Hackworth. It is about 10 years old, but could be written today. Even though it focuses on females, it could be applied to a large degree to some minority groups. <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/veterans/message/665?l=1" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/veterans/message/665?l=1</a></p>

		<p>  And you wonder why so many American companies are in the ditch? Look no further than this article. Companies must spend millions defending themselves against lawsuits brought by minority organizations. China doesn&rsquo;t have this problem and our industries are moving to China. </p>

		<p>Blacks complain that they aren&rsquo;t getting jobs, and now they complain that the jobs they want aren&rsquo;t to their liking.  Perhaps those blacks should get into shakedowns and creating racial division for a living.  Certainly has done wonders for Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and more &#8216;black leaders&rsquo; to come in the near future!</p>

		<p>  The smartest thing that US Airways could do is to apologize for allowing this Mickey-Mouse insensitive childish company-damaging stupidity to go on for so long.  The airlines are all in serious trouble; they don&rsquo;t need this nonsense.  And the best way to deal with it is to stop it and discretely apologize to their employees affected by this boorish and un-professional behavior.  Then listen to them on ways to alter this regrettable and embarrassing strain of their corporate culture.  This whole affair is not as bad as a plane crash but it more than spilling a glass of wine on the new dress of a former president.  It&rsquo;s a problem, so do what all corporations do with problems: identify it:fix it:deal with more serious things (like the looming bankruptcy of ALL the airlines). <br>
    It should have never reached this point. </p>

		<p>The racist naacp needs to be banned from the US. If blacks want true equality in American society they need to stop with all the separatist terms &amp; organizations. </p>
<p>History of the term &#8220;Hyphenated American&#8221;</p>
<p>The term &#8220;hyphenated American&#8221; was popularized in the 1910s by President Theodore Roosevelt, responding to the increasing fractionalization within the nation along ethnic lines. In an October 12, 1915 speech to the Knights of Columbus, Roosevelt said,</p>
<p>    &#8220;There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism. When I refer to hyphenated Americans, I do not refer to naturalized Americans. Some of the very best Americans I have ever known were naturalized Americans, Americans born abroad. But a hyphenated American is not an American at all. &hellip; The one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin, of preventing all possibility of its continuing to be a nation at all, would be to permit it to become a tangle of squabbling nationalities, an intricate knot of German-Americans, Irish-Americans, English-Americans, French-Americans, Scandinavian-Americans or Italian-Americans, each preserving its separate nationality, each at heart feeling more sympathy with Europeans of that nationality, than with the other citizens of the American Republic. &hellip; There is no such thing as a hyphenated American who is a good American. The only man who is a good American is the man who is an American and nothing else.&#8221;</p>
<p>President Woodrow Wilson also regarded those whom he termed &#8220;hyphenated Americans&#8221; (German-Americans, Irish-Americans, etc.) with suspicion, saying, &#8220;Any man who carries a hyphen about with him carries a dagger that he is ready to plunge into the vitals of this Republic whenever he gets ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>  I&rsquo;m afraid a discrete apology or free travel vouchers will not be enough Simonetta. That is the real problem. The NAACP will demand millions in compensation for hurt feelings, which will possibly be enough to drive US Airways back into Chapter 11. The airline business is already shaking and near the brink of collapse. </p>

		<p>I wonder how much of grouping employees by race was truly discriminatory.</p>
<p>Something tells me that the black and white employees probably preferred to work with their own kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the appointment of a civil-rights monitor over US Airways&rsquo; Philadelphia operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>A civil-rights monitor? What the hell is that? This immediately conjures up an image of a political commissar, watching over everyone, keeping their eyes out for &#8220;counter revolutionary&#8221; thought crime. Scary stuff.</p>

		<p>U.S.Airways,started the the big push for diversity in the mid 80&rsquo;s,raising blacks who could not put two sentences together to positions of authority,just to gain power over Whites,it is the main reason that the company failed,not much different than the minority mortgage meltdown in the housing industry.</p>
