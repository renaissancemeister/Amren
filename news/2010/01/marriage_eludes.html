<h1>Marriage Eludes Many Black Women</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Claudia Pinto, The Tennessean, January 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Roughly 50 percent of black women in Davidson County have never been married, compared to 25 percent of white women, according to 2008 U.S. Census Bureau data. Nationwide, 46 percent of black women haven&rsquo;t tied the knot vs. 23 percent of white women.</p>
<p>The statistics back up what Crouch [Melanie Crouch, 42, a single black woman] came to recognize on her own  &mdash;  that marriage is no longer a given for young black women. How women react to these odds is a personal decision that experts say has implications for everyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ninety percent of my girlfriends are single. They&rsquo;re teachers, attorneys, professional women,&#8221; Crouch said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re fashion-friendly. We&rsquo;re regulars at the beauty shop. We take Zumba classes. But there we are on Friday nights watching a movie together.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;It&rsquo;s a numbers game&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Black or white, the reasons why people don&rsquo;t marry are largely the same: Their parents weren&rsquo;t married, so they don&rsquo;t see the need, either; they&rsquo;re wary of getting married because of the high divorce rates; they&rsquo;re putting off marriage to pursue careers; they&rsquo;re living together instead of getting married; or they just don&rsquo;t want to get married at all.</p>
<p>But MaryAltani Karpos, a Vanderbilt senior lecturer in sociology and criminology, said African-American women face a problem that&rsquo;s unique unto them  &mdash;  there are simply more women than men. There are 12.9 million black women ages 18 to 64 in the United States, compared to 11.7 million black men, according to census data.</p>
<p>The number of eligible men is reduced even further for women who want to date men who are as educated as they are. Census data shows that 71 percent of black graduate students are women.</p>
<p>Success may be a Catch-22 for women. Kevin Terrell, 24, said he thinks a lot of African-American men feel like they aren&rsquo;t needed if a woman is too independent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Girlfriends act like wives</b></p>
<p>Shellie R. Warren, 35, who has never been married, acknowledges that African-American women are at a disadvantage numbers-wise. However, she believes that women who want to be married need to take a look at their role in why are they are single.</p>
<p>Instead of asking, &#8220;Why don&rsquo;t men want to get married?&#8221; Warren said the question should be, &#8220;Why should men want to get married?&#8221; She argues that men get everything they need from the women they date.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have one girlfriend to cook for them, another one for sex,&#8221; said Warren, who is the author of Inside of Me, a book about how her life experiences led her to embrace abstinence before marriage, and a second book coming out this spring called Eyes Open, Legs Closed. That book is about how Warren&rsquo;s view on the purpose of sex has changed since practicing celibacy.</p>
<p>Warren, of Nashville, said if women want to get married, then girlfriends need to stop acting like wives.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Others suggest that if African-American women want to increase their likelihood of getting married they should date men of other races. However, Karpos said black women aren&rsquo;t as likely to do that as black men, perhaps because we rarely see images of black women and white men in the media.</p>
<p>Warren said she just feels more comfortable dating black men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Culturally there are differences,&#8221; she said, adding that dating white guys means having to be asked questions like, &#8220;Why does your hair do that?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Kids often come first</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Roughly 78 percent of African-American babies in Tennessee were born to women who weren&rsquo;t married in 2008, according to data recently released by the Tennessee Department of Health. That&rsquo;s compared to 35.2 percent of white babies and 53.6 percent of Hispanic babies.</p>
<p>The rate of babies born to unmarried African-American women has been higher than that of white and Hispanic babies for years. However, the rates have grown significantly in Tennessee, from 58.7 percent in 1980 to 78.2 percent today.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Studies have shown that when fathers aren&rsquo;t present, all the negative statistics go up  &mdash;  suicide, teen pregnancy, high school drop out rate, criminal behavior.</p>
<p>But Karpos believes the situation may not be as dire as people think. Even though marriage is considered to be the ideal, Karpos points out that half of them end in divorce. And nearly 40 percent of opposite-sex, unmarried American households include children, according to the census bureau&rsquo;s current population survey.</p>

		<p>As an attorney, I personally know at least a dozen of these smart black women who can&rsquo;t find suitable mates.  It is terrible.  </p>
<p>All women everywhere should just stop having sex outside of marriage.  Fornication should be a crime, like in the old days.</p>

<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s because men of other races (Whites and Orientals, especially) aren&rsquo;t interested in dating black women.  A few months ago AmRen posted the results of data collected by an online dating service and it showed black women were the LEAST likely to be approached by men of ANY race, period.</p>
<p>Now the magic question of course is, why?  We KNOW what&rsquo;s wrong with black men!  Perhaps this recent dialogue could shed some light on that question we&rsquo;d otherwise not get from this article, which is typical leftist twaddle.</p>

		<p>The effect on white girls of seeing white women movie and tv stars dating, marrying, and breeding with afrovoodoos is that the afrovoodoo male look fashionable and attractive to white girls. But we miss the effect on young afrovoodoo males. They also see how hot the white girls are who marry black athletic, entertainment, and business stars, and the common, typical afrovoodoo also wants white girls. But the white girls don&rsquo;t want the typical afrovoodoo, so she rebuffs his advance. He becomes enrages and loses control and we all know what happens next.  Anne Pressley&rsquo;s rape and murder is our future.<br>

		<p>Black men vote with their actions.  Obviously they believe that non-black women are more attractive than black ones.  On top of that, obesity is a serious problem among black women.  As for the media not portraying white men with black women, this is obviously true and one would have to be a fool to believe that there is no underlying agenda to this - and I&rsquo;m not saying they should portray such couples.  Ideally, they would only portray same-race couples because this is what should be encouraged.</p>

		<p>Women have the power, sorry to offend the libbers, but they do.  It is the old why buy the cow story.  Black men are primarily interested in having as many children as possible with as many women as possible.  Being a husband, or even a real father (as opposed to a sperm donor), is not important to them.  Bragging rights are.  Until black woman put a dime between their legs, pick male partners who have some value in life (other than an erection) and demand that their men act civilized things will never change.</p>
<p>Women have the most responsibility for procreation because women pay the highest costs for procreation.  Fair?  Nope.  Reality?  Yup!</p>
<p>And sorry girls, this is not a legacy of slavery.  The further we get away from slavery the higher the illegitimacy rates goes.<br>

		<p>Black men seem to have a difficult time with the basic concept of putting ones&rsquo; children first, to the detriment of ones&rsquo; own pursuits.  We white men know that, to a man, we would all gladly step in front of a bullet about to hit any one of our children, our wives, and dare I say, in many cases, even our ex-wives&hellip;..because we know what makes a man and what things are lacking in those who are &#8220;less than men.&#8221;  We stand proud and know our lasting testament to our lives is what our children speak of us when we are gone.  Sadly, that is being lost on too many men, especially those of minority races.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m convinced that blacks, left to their own devices, would be extinct in a half century. They are an evolutionary dead end. If black women refuse to date men of other races, I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s just fine with the men of other races!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not as if there are 12 million black women and 6 million black men. Add to that that there are an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants, and what? 1 million new legal immigrants to the USA every year for the last 30 years&hellip; most of them males&hellip; and it sure looks like it is black women who are discriminatory, but I suppose it&rsquo;s Ok when women are discriminatory or engage in &#8216;Eugenics&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And is it a coincidence that the great evils of our time, or the recent past, are named &#8216;Sexual harassment&rsquo; and &#8216;racial discrimination&rsquo; and not, say &#8216;Sexual discrimination&rsquo; and &#8216;racial harassment&rsquo;?<br>

		<p>&#8220;Roughly 78 percent of African-American babies in Tennessee were born to women who weren&rsquo;t married in 2008.&#8221;</p>
<p>And who pays for these babies?   &mdash;   their housing, education, hospital care, food stamps, Head-start, etc., etc.?  Why White families, of course.</p>
<p>In America, each White family with children must not only support their own kids, but also the children of irresponsible African (and soon to be Haitians). This is a sort of slavery on Whites (your labor stolen from you and your family).  Note also that Africans begin having babies at aged 13, where the average for Whites is much, much later.  Africans will have almost 2 generations during the time Whites have one.  And meanwhile, the Whites pay for both generations (in tax-supoported welfare).</p>

		<p>I read this article yesterday and there are many obstacles for Black women to find suitable spouses. The first one is that there are more black men in prison than in college. The second obstacle is that there are black men who refuse to date black women due to issues that they had to deal with in the past. The third obstacle is the number of gay black men. The one black man quoted in the article stated that he felt that black women were too independent and did not need men and he was turned off by that. The reason for this is these women learned from their mothers and grandmothers that men are not to be trusted and will not stay for the long term and so a woman needed to be independent to take care of herself and her children.</p>

		<p>Of course black men aren&rsquo;t needed.  Why would a poor black woman need a husband and father for her kids when the federal government will take care of those positions with its food stamps, WIC, TANF, housing vouchers, free and reduced school lunch, free busing to school, Head Start, subsidized child care, heating aid, Medicaid, Earned Income Tax credit, Pell Grants, tax credits that give her more than she paid in taxes, school vouchers, SSI, et al.</p>
<p>Indeed, if she gets married, she will not be eligible for many of these wealth redistribution programs due to having a slightly higher income.  A lot of people on the right (especially white nationalists) often bash black men for their &#8220;irresponsible fatherhood&#8221; and for being &#8220;deadbeat dads.&#8221;  This is misguided, as the ruinous state of the black family can be traced back to black women and the governments that pay them to have fatherless children at a young age.</p>
<p>The federal government&rsquo;s welfare programs destroy families, probably intentionally.  Conservatives should pay attention to this fact and instead of worrying about some gays marrying each other in California, they should work to end welfare (not &#8220;reform&#8221; it) if they really care about preventing the destruction of the family as an institution.</p>

		<p>I live in a college town and I see a growing number of Black women (some of these women are attractive as well) dating White men. These men are not wimpy or bubba looking type of White men either. They are often well groomed and in good shape.</p>
<p>I guess these women have decided to expand thier options or they have given up on their own Black men. </p>

		<p>how deftly they danced around the real factors behind the issue. For most men, black women are the least attractive of women, that&rsquo;s just the reality, it&rsquo;s tough for black women to compete for the eye of a black man when there so many beautiful women.  sencondly, why would a black man marry an unattractive AND poor black woman when he can just as easily  marry an over weight, unattractive white woman who has a job and credit? Thirdly, yes, there may be a difference in the ratio of available black men/women, but why? for one, there is a large percentage of black men in prison, (and a large percentage of them are serving time for raping white women)Forth, black women are not blind, they see the same things we see in the black man that the rest of society sees, and they dismiss a large number of black men as marriage material, and rightfully so.</p>

		<p>I once read an interesting theory, I believe it was here on AR, that (ghetto) black teenage women have babies as their &#8220;coming of age&#8221; experience.  They will not buy a house, will not get married, will not graduate from college.  Their defining marker of adulthood is having a child and going on welfare.  So I can readily see why the &#8220;less marriage&#8221; syndrome is happening.</p>

		<p>Even if I am Korean, I do feel sorry for the young black women, and it is indeed my desire that they find suitable men very soon.  </p>
<p>North America is known in East Asia for the equal opportunities that they are provided compare to men.  I am glad women of all colors in North America are treated equally and provided with chances to have independence, but I hope they understand that simply because a woman is married that does not mean the married woman is any less independent than single women.  Women can have just as much &#8220;independence&#8221; or prove to the world that they have &#8220;independence&#8221; while being happily married.  It sounds quite absurd and ridiculous to me that staying single is a great, powerful way for women to prove that she is strong and independent!  </p>

		<p>I am finishing up a graduate degree in a historically black college. (Long story as to why I went there, instead of to a better school, but that is for another time.)</p>
<p>I have often had to work in groups with black females, none of whom were very attractive, but some of whom were reasonably intelligent. (Not geniuses or anything, but somewhat above average.) </p>
<p>I have heard them discuss amongst themselves that they would have to find a white guy if they wanted someone who:</p>
<p>1. Was about as intelligent as they are.<br>
2. Had some sort of plan and aspiration for their life.<br>
3. Worked in a professional or semi-professional job.<br>
4. Would stick around and help care for their potential children.<br>
5. Wouldn&rsquo;t be needing bail money.<br>
6. Would not go whoring around on them at any available opportunity. <br>
7. Who wouldn&rsquo;t be physically abusive towards them to a greater or lesser degree.</p>
<p>Their alternative to dating a white man would be to settle for marrying a garbage truck driver or some sort of older version of a hood rat. I think that many of them who have some standards stay single, take up with one of the few white guys who would have them, or just give up on the idea of having intelligent conversations with their potential spouse.</p>
<p>And it appears that most of the intelligent ones would pass the paper bag test, thus indicating a certain amount of misplaced white genetic heritage driving the intelligence.</p>
<p>But they know it, too.</p>

		<p>Marriage means zero to blacks.  Sex &amp; babies at middle school age is almost regular for them.  Those women mentioned have undoubtedly found many &#8220;suitable&#8221; men, I believe.  They just don&rsquo;t have them under enforceable contract.  Ever heard of &#8220;welfare&#8221;?</p>

		<p>It should also be mentioned that in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa (and Haiti) promiscuity is rampant.  Many black households are just as fluid as they are in the U.S., with the men going from one to another, fathering children at random.  <br>
How typical it is for a black man to blame women, claiming to just not be needed!  Most black women, like all women, want to be married.  And most would date non-black men, given the chance.  Women want love and emotional security, and a welfare check doesn&rsquo;t supply that.  But more black men are wedding white women, more homosexual black men are coming out, more black men are going to prison and dying from ghetto violence  &mdash;  so there&rsquo;s a dearth of them available to black women.</p>

		<p>Someone mentioned obesity being a problem amongst black women.</p>
<p>Thing is, they like to throw their weight around  &mdash;  literally and metaphorically!</p>
<p>I recall seeing an episode of Divorce Court where a biracial couple was divorcing (the husband was black, of course).  The husband had this poster board listing the reasons why he preferred white women  &mdash;  and at the top of the list, white women are more compliant.</p>
<p>Black women tend to be very in-your-face.</p>

		<p>Warren said she just feels more comfortable dating black men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I agree with this lady. But the poster was right when he/she claimed that if a white person says this, they would be demonized as a racist. Well, I am a white male and I married a white female, so I guess I&rsquo;m a racist. Put that in your pipe and smoke it! Liberal media disgusts me. One big reason that white man/black woman is not portrayed in the media is that libbers are afraid to enrage the black man. But there is a very small amount of attractive black women, and they are almost always &#8220;spoken for&#8221;. If I&rsquo;m in that situation looking for a black girl, I&rsquo;m not just going to settle for some unattractive one because the good lookin&rsquo; ones are taken. I will date white or Asian or Hispanic or European. </p>

		<p>There are two side to this story. Granted, with today&rsquo;s young black men, there isn&rsquo;t much to chose from in the black community. Their behavior, attitude and beliefs are totally incompatible with what whites deem as &#8216;marryable&rsquo;. But these black men are raised by women. Or, to correct myself, they grow up with women (they&rsquo;re not raised; they just grow up), so it&rsquo;s the women responsible for shaping those black men&rsquo;s attitudes and beliefs.</p>
<p>Second, if young black women acted with any self-respect and earned better treatment through their OWN behavior from the men they hook up with, maybe the young men&rsquo;s standards just might improve a tad. These young women are also raised by women, and you would think they might want to pass along attributes that would earn their daughters a little more respect.</p>

		<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s because men of other races (Whites and Orientals, especially) aren&rsquo;t interested in dating black women. A few months ago AmRen posted the results of data collected by an online dating service and it showed black women were the LEAST likely to be approached by men of ANY race, period.</p>
<p><br>
The article stated that black women are the least likely to be approached, it didn&rsquo;t say they didn&rsquo;t get approached at all. My friends and I have used these services and haven&rsquo;t had any problems getting dates with non-black men, one of them is actually engaged to an latino man she met on e-harmony. I always wonder why on topics like this they always discuss &#8220;white men&#8221; as the solution, like they&rsquo;re the only other group of men? This is america threre are plenty of wonderful latino, asian, carribean,indian, and middle eastern men.<br>
Why does everthing has to be strictly black and white, Bw/wm or WM/AW or WM/LW etc. all the time in a diverse country?</p>

		<p>One of the reasons for such low marriage rates for black women has to be that with white taxpayers being forced to support the children these women produce, the black male in the US has been reduced to the status of &#8220;sperm donor&#8221;.  No need to get married when there&rsquo;s no need for any genuine committment.</p>

		<p>&#8220;But more black men are wedding white women, more homosexual black men are coming&#8221;</p>
<p>The number of black men marrying white women is still small.  The number of homosexuals is quite small.</p>
<p>&#8220;more black men are going to prison and dying from ghetto violence&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that is a good part of the reason.  But the main cause of the &#8220;dearth of them available to black women&#8221; is the fact that black men are in general BUMS and black woman are easy.</p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;ve known many of these well educated black women in academia. Their situation is quite tragic. Many of them are hard working, bright, and of good moral character. Of course, I live in the South so many of these women are also very religious. These unfortunate women just can&rsquo;t find decent educated black men. If they marry at all, they usually end up marrying the better quality blue collar black men.  </p>

<p>Everyone knows there are very few black men who would make good marriage partners. </p>
<p>The &#8220;good&#8221; black men know this also. So why would they want to settle down with one woman when they can have their pick?</p>

These black women are raising these black men into the inadequate mates they become. <br>

I&rsquo;ve read that black men do not allow black women to date white men and enforce it with violence.</p>

We see light skinned obama style mulattoes all the time at the top of the govt., media, and  businesses.  Rare to see a full blooded afrovoodoo american who looks fully african.  The leaders have light skin and slightly lessened afro features.  Sharpton is the exception, and Jackson is so ugly he&rsquo;s actually doing us a favor every time he&rsquo;s on tv. Ditto Sharpton and Whoopi Goldberg. </p>
<p>How many of these light skinned blacks had white daddys?  Seems that for every several white girls breeding with afrovoodoos, you might only occasionally see just one white man with black woman.</p>
<p>The light skinned whites are mostly born to white mothers!!!</p>
<p>God, the shame of our race- liberal white women.</p>

		<p>for one thing, the women who have the most problems are the ones with the highest education and with the best paying jobs. These women have no children, they own their own home and are able to take care of themselves. This is threatning to many men. As far as Black women being unattractive, please explain how Halle Barry, Tyra Banks and Beyonce&rsquo; are often listed among the most beautiful women? Of these 3 only Halle Barry is biracial.</p>

<p>I am not disagreeing with you, I am just providing the point of view of an East Asian dude but, I do not find it really threatening if a woman is well educated, and owns a big fat home and a nice career.  If anything, a woman who is well-educated and has a nice job only sounds more attractive.  </p>
<p>Put it this way: which type of women would have an advantage when it comes to choosing or being chosen as marriage partners, women with proper education/gigantic house or women with less education/no house?  </p>
<p>My parents started to implying that I should start thinking about getting married&hellip;.haha</p>

		<p>My view on the problems of black women are that men are men.  For some reason, black women have never learned this.  Women have to enforce the standards of family values and civilization, because the men won&rsquo;t.  It&rsquo;s women who have traditionally been a civilizing influence on men, not vice versa.  </p>
<p>It is European mothers who warned their daughters about the dangers of being too permissive with men.  &#8220;Why buy the cow, when you can get the milk for free?&#8221;  Maybe African mothers never came up with that advice because Africans tend to be lactose intolerant, I don&rsquo;t know. But in any case that&rsquo;s what black women are doing, they give away the milk for free and then wonder why their men don&rsquo;t want to buy the cow.</p>
<p>Black women need to administer and drink a dose of bitter medicine.  NO man deserves the trappings of fatherhood including bragging rights unless he&rsquo;s prepared to act like a husband and be a full-time dad to his children.  These women need to stop having babies out of wedlock. If their maternal instincts are that strong then they should empty the foster homes of black children and raise them as single mothers.  Even get paid as foster mothers if they can&rsquo;t afford to freely adopt.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t as many white bimbos out there as the media would have people believe who want to sleep with and get impregnated by semi-literate, unemployed thugs.  Once black women make it impossible for black men to have their cake and eat it, too, they will get the caliber of men to raise families with, not before.</p>
