<h1><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,674140,00.html">New Study Looks at Challenges Faced by Germany&rsquo;s Muslims</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sheila Lalwani, Spiegel, January 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that many immigrants have a hard time in Germany. A new study has found that women wearing headscarves have a particularly hard time on the job market and a quarter of those with Turkish backgrounds face discrimination when looking for work.</p>
<p>It is early afternoon at Internet Treffpunkt, a convenience store in Kreuzberg, a neighborhood in Berlin that is home to many Turks and other minorities. Hedi Dashti, the store&rsquo;s proprietor, is busy. One customer hands over her parcel to send through his DHL counter. Another customer buys cigarettes. The door swings open, ushering in the blustery winter wind, and a third customer waves hello.</p>
<p>Dashti  &mdash;  an immigrant from Iraq who fled to Germany 20 years ago with his family  &mdash;  speaks to customers in English, German and his mother tongue, Kurdish. He has adjusted to life in Germany and made German friends, while also maintaining his religious identity: Dashti is a practicing Muslim, abstains from eating pork and observes Friday prayers.</p>
<p>And despite occasionally feeling like an outsider, he really wishes he had German citizenship. &#8220;We are not really Germans, but Germany is our country,&#8221; Dashti said.</p>
<p>It is a dilemma shared by many of Germany&rsquo;s approximately four million Muslims. And a new survey supports the widespread feeling of dislocation that many of them feel.</p>
<p><b>Far from Encouraging</b></p>
<p>Released in Berlin on Monday, the Open Society Institute&rsquo;s report entitled &#8220;Muslims in Europe: A Report on 11 EU Cities&#8221; paints a familiar picture of stunted integration among the some 15 to 20 million Muslims living in the European Union. The number is expected to double by 2025. Two German cities, Berlin and Hamburg, are among the cities the report focused on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s findings are far from encouraging. The report says that unemployment is twice the national average for Turkish nationals in Germany, and that 28 percent of Turks reported discrimination when looking for work. Twenty-three percent said they encountered it at work.</p>
<p>In particular, &#8220;things are getting worse for veiled women&#8221; in Germany, according to one survey respondent, referring to the headscarf, which is widely prevalent in Germany. The report points out that women wearing headscarves are vulnerable to discrimination on the job. Wearing religious symbols such as the headscarf is banned in certain German government jobs, but women said the attitude has spilled over into the private sector. Some women in the study also said wearing headscarves prevented them from participating in all areas of work, or from securing apprenticeships or internships at all.</p>
<p>The report also focused on education, and again found Germany wanting. Survey respondents reported a culture of low aspirations and discouragement by schoolteachers grounded in assumptions and stereotypes about students based on their religious or cultural backgrounds. The report cited improving access to education, particularly at a young age, as critical with German language knowledge prior to entering school seen as a key.</p>
<p><b>A Favored Destination</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Unless you get that right, you are going to have problems,&#8221; Nazia Hussain, director of the project, told SPIEGEL ONLINE.</p>
<p>The study&rsquo;s findings correspond with a number of similar surveys undertaken in Germany and Europe in recent years. A Jan. 2009 study conducted by the Berlin-based Institute for Population and Development found that Turkish immigrants in particular are faring badly, with many struggling to integrate even if they come from families which arrived in Germany generations ago. A 2009 study by the Bertelsmann Foundation found that failed integration was costing Germany up to â‚¬16 billion per year.</p>
<p>Much of the problem is rooted in a German society that has yet to come to grips with having become a favored destination for immigrants. While the Open Society Report points out that citizenship in adopted nations is essential to building social cohesion, many immigrants in Germany do not have German passports. Indeed, even children of immigrant families born in Germany are not automatically granted citizenship.</p>
<p>As a result, immigrants in Germany  &mdash;  even those who have achieved citizenship  &mdash;  often feel excluded, the study found.</p>
<p>Such attitudes are not surprising, says Dr. Ruth Mandel, whose 2008 book, &#8220;Cosmopolitan Anxieties: Turkish Challenges to Citizenship and Belonging in Germany,&#8221; largely focuses on Turks in Berlin. Even if German laws allow immigrant children born in Germany to apply for citizenship, German society as a whole may not consider them German. &#8220;It will take the German masses quite a while to accept it,&#8221; Mandel says</p>
<p>Still, Dashti says from behind his counter, things could be worse. &#8220;Germany  &mdash;  as the Kurdish people say  &mdash;  is safe from war. It is in Europe. Every immigrant thinks Europe and America is great.&#8221;</p>
<p>But then again, things could be so much better.</p>

		<p>If the German Turks and Iraqis feel so alienated, then why don&rsquo;t they emigrate to another Muslim country of their choice? It&rsquo;s because of the money. No matter how they feel, they&rsquo;ll never get the high-paying jobs in Turkey or Iraq, tthat they have in Germany.</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>What is this talk about &#8220;immigrants&#8221;?  When and where did that word creep in?   Despite Dr. Ruth&rsquo;s pious concern for the integration of these &#8220;immigrants&#8221; into German society, these people came originally to Germany as &#8220;Guest Workers&#8221;, not immigrants. Then, others came as refugees who were admitted, presumably, for a temporary stay until they could return home again. There was never (back then) any talk about them being &#8220;immigrants&#8221;.  Nor was there any notion suggested about assimilating them into Germany or making them citizens. Little by little, all of these newer notions have been slipped into the debate. </p>
<p>This is a good example of how the de-Germanization of Germany (and the de-Europeanizing of Europe), plus the de-whitening of all white countries around the world, is proceeding. Just nibble, step by step, utilizing every opportunity to capitalize on wars, turmoil, and natural disasters, and playing upon white people&rsquo;s misplaced gullability and altruism   &mdash;   as we currently see happening in Haiti. </p>
<p>In every case, the victims, orphans and displaced must be brought here   &mdash;   first as &#8220;refugees&#8221;, &#8220;asylum seekers&#8221;, &#8220;victims&#8221;, etc.  Then, in another generation, when memories have faded, the word will be changed to &#8220;immigrants&#8221; and we&rsquo;ll be castigated for not having done enough to hasten their &#8220;assimilation&#8221;.  Such sly deceptiveness in slipping these people across under misleading labels!  Accepting refugees or (presumably temporary) guest workers was never meant to have anything to do with assimilation or the granting of citizenship!<br>

		<p>One might ask&hellip;Why is it that Germany has become one of the favored destinations of immigrants? Could it be the weather?  the geography? Or might it be the nature of a society created by Teutons? It might be the latter&hellip; The problem is&hellip; if the demos changes too much so will the society. The Germans may prefer on whole&hellip;that their nation remain Teutonic. Life is give and take, I&rsquo;m sure the Turks contribute  enrichment to Germany, its a balance thats necessary.

		<p>This article is not terribly illuminating. Many German Turks&rsquo;s do not acquire German citizenship because they do not want to give up their Turkish citizenship, and ties to the home country are much stronger those to Germany. This reflects the fact that they&rsquo;re here solely for economic reasons, and the vast majority are in fact beneficiaries of generous social benefits paid for by German taxpayers. The Germans love to flog themselves for failing to &ldquo;assimilate&rdquo; the Turks, and being relatively inexperienced with immigration issues, they fail to grasp the fact that assimilation is an ACTIVE process, not something that you do TO someone else. <br>
Crime is very high among Muslims generally (whenever a crime is committed, a German Turk will say: &ldquo;It must have been an Arab&rdquo;), and Germans are now trying to get used to American levels of crime after living in virtually crime free cities and towns all their lives. (But I consider the Russian and Bulgarian mafia to be much scarier than the Turks.)<br>
While many Turks are successful and hard-working, the IQ disparity between ethnic Germans and Turkish immigrants is at least as large as that between white Americans and African-Americans, possibly even larger (the Germans are highly intelligent). Most Turks and Muslims in Germany simply cannot learn German well enough to function at a high-level occupationally, and many speak a broken, pidgin German after 30 years or more. Even Turks born here seem education-resistant, and speak a kind of mangled street German. Many or most Turkish parents are actively hostile to the educational system, so their children&rsquo;s limited potential is reduced even further. <br>
The mentality of Turks is a vastly different from that of Germans that assimilation is a pipe dream. Turks not believe in a free press, the separation of church and state, women&rsquo;s rights, or any of the other things taken for granted in the first world.<br>
Despite all this nonsense about assimilation, the reality is the formation of Turkish enclaves within Germany.<br>
Things are reaching the tipping point demographically, and many Germans are afraid of losing their country.</p>
<p>The lesson of the cataclysmic failure of multiculturalism and assimilation is simple:<br>
There are profound differences between ethnicities, and these cannot be raised by shifting people around from country to country.<br>

		<p>Having lived in Germany for almost 3 decades has allowed me to have an opinion on the matter of mass immigration to this country. The muslim immigrant or migrant as they are referred to here in Germany are the people with the least interest in joining the crowd so to speak but instead are content to build &#8220;Little Istanbuls&#8221; or similar type ghettos across Germany making many German cities appear very &#8220;exotic&#8221; but not especially German. The millions of migrants looking for work who have chosen Germany as a place to settle from Italy,Spain and Greece amongst other countries have little problem blending in and becoming part of the main stream. Not being able to or refusing to blend in to their new envoirnment is almost exclusively a muslim migrant problem. Turks and Kurds even after living in Germany for many years often still cannot speak German not to mention the obvious problem that many Turks / Kurds have with forcing their women to wear clothes that give most Germans the feeling these people came to change the host countries and not the other way around thru integration and or assimilation.</p>

Here are a few <i>other</i> things that may well be true of our new friend Dashti that aren&rsquo;t quite as innocuous as his refusal to eat of the cloven-hoofed swine. As &#8220;a practicing Muslim in Germany&#8221; it is also entirely possible   &mdash;   or even <i>probable</i>   &mdash;   that Dashti and his entire family <i>also</i> believe:</p>
<p>* That European gender-equality notions and laws are not only ludicrous but an offense to Allah and his &#8220;prophet&#8221; Mohammed, who quite explicitly states that females are inferior to, <i>and the property of</i>, males; </p>
<p>* That the only sure way to keep women from filthy Western attitudes towards sex-as-pleasure is to &#8220;circumcize&#8221; girls entering puberty so that getting pleasure from sex is no longer physically possible; </p>
<p>* That Christians and Jews are descended from pigs and monkeys; </p>
<p>* That 9/11 was an &#8220;inside job&#8221; cooked up by the Bush admin to foment &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221;; </p>
<p>* That Shari&rsquo;a law should   &mdash;   and eventually WILL   &mdash;   supersede and supplant Germany&rsquo;s time-tested civil and criminal law traditions; </p>
<p>* That apostasy (leaving the Muslim religion) deserves death; </p>
<p>* That all white women are nothing but tramps and therefore legitimate targets for gang rape; </p>
<p>* That today&rsquo;s <i>kuffars</i> are tomorrow&rsquo;s <i>jizya</i>-paying <i>dhimmis</i> and &#8220;reverts&#8221; (converts) to what he is told by his imam every Friday afternoon is &#8220;The One True Faith&#8221; divinely destined to rule not just Germany but the world. </p>

		<p><i>This article is not terribly illuminating. Many German Turks&rsquo;s do not acquire German citizenship because they do not want to give up their Turkish citizenship, and ties to the home country are much stronger those to Germany</i></p>
<p>Perfect comment. I currently live in Germany but I have no plan to stay here forever. Even if I would want to stay here, I would never wish to give up my citizenship to become a bogus German. For what reason? Naturalized German citizens aren&rsquo;t considered German in Germans&rsquo; eye even if they are 4th generation people (including Italians, Greeks or former Yugoslavians, even ethnic Germans from Russia!). The indigenous and non-indigenous problem in Germany is much different than in France or the UK. </p>
<p><i>Crime is very high among Muslims generally (whenever a crime is committed, a German Turk will say: &ldquo;It must have been an Arab&rdquo;),</i></p>
<p>100% correct again&hellip; Turks in Germany despise Arabs intensely but unfortunately, every dark haired person is considered as Turk. Note the Italians, Russians or former Yugoslavians aren&rsquo;t doing well too.</p>
<p><i>While many Turks are successful and hard-working, the IQ disparity between ethnic Germans and Turkish immigrants is at least as large as that between white Americans and African-Americans, possibly even larger (the Germans are highly intelligent).</i></p>
<p>False. Germans have an average IQ of 104 (maybe the highest in Europe), Turks 92 (higher than some European countries), not as large as in the USA. </p>
<p>And Germans -my humble opinion- are not that intelligent. Although they may appear to be hard working, their general knowledge are ludicrous, especially on history. Their English are poor, although most of them find cool to speak Denglish (an ugly mixture of German and English), so are their math skills. I think it lies in lax and trendy high school education. The Chinese students are the most successful ones despite language difficulties (or you doubt it?).</p>
<p><i>The mentality of Turks is a vastly different from that of Germans that assimilation is a pipe dream. Turks not believe in a free press, the separation of church and state, women&rsquo;s rights, or any of the other things taken for granted in the first world.</i></p>
<p>Yes, we are vastly different and the assimilation hoax is annoying but the separation of church and state is a cornerstone of the Republic of Turkey. Furthermore, in the 1930s, Turkey became one of the first countries in the world to give full political rights to women. </p>
<p>On the whole, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better if Turks and Germans keep themselves apart, preserving both races, languages and identities, rather than mixing it up?</p>

		<p><i>I&rsquo;m sure it would be similar for Germans living in Turkey</i></p>
<p>There are THOUSANDS of Germans (mostly old people) living in Turkey, in the southern sunbelt. They create their own ghettos in gated communities with German flags flying where Turks are not allowed to enter. How would it feel if you can&rsquo;t step in somewhere on your own soil?</p>
<p>They refuse to learn Turkish although some of them have been living since years, yet nobody is forcing them to be Turkish. Thanks to the municipality, they get their bills in German, too.</p>
<p>I have no problem with them as they pay into the system but isn&rsquo;t it contradictionary to emphasize on integration here and refuse to adapt somewhere else?</p>

<p>Answer:<br>
a)  Where Turks are not allowed to enter?  (And I doubt it.)   If really so, then it is only because Turks are foolish enough to allow it.  Whose fault if that?</p>
<p>b)  The elderly Germans are there as retirees, bringing money INTO the country and spending it there, helping the economy. They are not competing with Turks for jobs but creating them, nor sending  Turkish money out of the country, nor raising families and colonizing the country. Nor engaging in local politics, demanding a vote and running for office.  Big difference!   No comparison at all. </p>

		<p>   &#8220;many immigrants in Germany do not have German passports. Indeed, even children of immigrant families born in Germany are not automatically granted citizenship.&rdquo;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>a)   Are they really &#8220;immigrants&#8221;?   Or is  that word being cunningly slipped in,  when they were originally admitted as refugees, or asylum seekers, or other temporary guests who were granted residence (but nothing more)?</p>
<p>b)   In Europe   &mdash;    like most of the rest of the world  (and unlike the USA)   &mdash;  - children take the citizenship of their parents, regardless of WHERE they were born.  They are who their parents are.   It&rsquo;s about ancestry, not geography;  it&rsquo;s about who you are, not where  you are.</p>

		<p>From Canada-Germany belongs to the indigenous Germans not to the immigrants. Europe, Canada,  Australia, and New Zealand  identity  is being undermined from 3rd. World immigrates. Why not move ten million Germans into Saudi Arabia, something the Saudis would be totally against and rightly so.   </p>

		<p>Deniz* Great..My opinion is that dialogue between people that have direct experience with these social dilema&rsquo;s is optimum. The dificulties begin when dialogue breaks down. I suppose all of human predicament can be seen in Yin and Yang. A male and female component. Masculinity is competition, The female is cooperation. I&rsquo;m aware each side has its alternate shadow&hellip;but still this is simply saying you have roosters and hens..bulls and cows. The female perception in extreme would say&hellip;love is all that matters.. after all we are all the same on the inside&hellip;The male would say no&hellip; excellence and individuality are what matters. The man prefers..His cave.. The woman ..the marketplace. Each nation has its own unique history, which is its identity, ..as with a person.. it is healthier when it knows itself.. as well as its limmitations. Yin and Yang are necessary for balance and wholeness. Are Germans superior to Turks? Please!..Is German food superior to Turkish food? I use the word Superior.. to demonstrate its ugliness. Yes different groups of people have levels of developement greater than others  in specific spheres&hellip;but this is the variety that edifies the genius of creation.  Humans have long known that we are different than all the lower species and thus are held to a higher moral standard. Every legitimate culture has virtue&hellip; its  those that prostitute themselves in any culture that betray the human dynamic. I think Identity and its vulnerability have been overlooked&hellip;if in reality&hellip;&#8221;you could be (anything) you want to be&#8221; That would make life pointless&hellip; what makes us different as individuals and races/cultures&hellip; is what makes life remarkable.</p>

		<p>Much of the problem is rooted in a German society that has yet to come to grips with having become a favored destination for immigrants</p>
<p>This &#8220;genius&#8221; obviously doesn&rsquo;t take into account that indigenous Germans probably didn&rsquo;t want the Turks in their country anyway. Especially if they weren&rsquo;t born there. So, I wouldn&rsquo;t &#8220;come to grips&#8221; with a community of people who didn&rsquo;t want to learn the native language, who still fly their home country flag and arrogantly lounge around while the native population has to go to work for a living and support the invading population. I&rsquo;d have a hard time with that too. </p>
