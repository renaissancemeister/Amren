<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Stand against racism; tell the Westin Hotel to say no to the American Renaissance Conference:</p>
<p>I thought this might be interesting to anyone out there interested in fighting against racism. February 19-21, the Dulles Airport Westin Hotel in Herndon, VA will be hosting some of the leading white supremacist &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; from around the world for the 9th American Renaissance Conference. American Renaissance is a racist website/newsletter edited by Reston, VA resident and infamous white supremacist, Jared Taylor. Every two years, Taylor organizes this conference which brings together many of the country&rsquo;s most active racists, such as anti-immigration fanatics, neo-nazis, and ex-Klansmen to listen to talks given by leading white supremacists. For example, David Duke, former grand master of the KKK, has been involved in past American Renaissance Conferences. People connected to the neo-Nazi website stormfront.org (which has as a motto &#8220;white pride worldwide&#8221;) have been faithful supporters of the AR conference over the years. American Renaissance argues that racial integration and respect for racial and ethnic diversity are the main reasons for the country&rsquo;s problems and that the solution is the &#8220;separation of the races&#8221; and a ban on non-white immigration. Jared Taylor uses long-debunked pseudo-science to claim that black people are genetically pre-disposed to have lower IQs than white people and that black people are naturally prone to violence and crime.</p>
<p>American Renaissance is the new face of the white supremacist movement. When most people think of white power groups, the image of drunken, &#8220;trashy rednecks&#8221; who can barely produce coherent sentences, or idiotic, violent skinheads comes to mind. American Renaissance is trying to change all that in an attempt to bring white supremacist ideas into respectable, mainstream society. For example, it is a rule that all males who attend the conference (and it is almost all males who attend; not many women ever show up), must wear a jacket and tie. This, presumably is to hide all of the smelly confederate flag t-shirts and swastika tattoos that conference attendees, like the Keystone State Skinheads, would have showing otherwise. Also, they never use words like &#8220;racism&#8221;, or &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; to describe themselves. Hilariously, Jared Taylor refers to himself as a &#8220;race relations expert&#8221;. He also calls himself a &#8220;race realist&#8221;. The term &#8220;race realist&#8221; is just code for &#8220;white supremacist&#8221;. They also never publicly use terms like &#8220;nigger&#8221;. Instead, they use academic language to argue ideas that are just as racist as the word &#8220;nigger&#8221; is.</p>
<p>In recent years, anti-racist activists have worked to expose this new &#8220;jacket and tie&#8221; racism for what it is. As a result of their work, many hotels in the area will not agree to host the conference. Four years ago, the Dulles Hyatt Hotel hosted the conference, but refused to ever host it again after anti-racism activists told the media and guests in the hotel about the conference. Two years ago the Dulles Crowne Plaza Hotel hosted the conference, and they too, have decided to never host it again when they realized that having their brand associated with white power is bad for business. Anti-racists have told other hotels in the area the truth about what American Renaissance is, and it has become increasingly difficult for these white supremacists to find a hotel to host them. As a result, American Renaissance used a different name to deceive the Dulles Westin Hotel into hosting them. They used the name New Century Foundation to get the Westin to host this year&rsquo;s conference.</p>
<p>I encourage anti-racists to call or email the Westin to let them know what the New Century Foundation Conference really is and to encourage hotel management to stand up for racial equality by refusing to host white supremacist gatherings. You can call them at 703-793-3366, or email them at info@westindulles.com.</p>
<p>Note that I am not arguing for anyone&rsquo;s free speech rights to be violated. I&rsquo;m not calling for any laws to force these trashy racists to keep quiet. I&rsquo;m not calling for any laws to force the hotel to refuse to host racist conferences. I believe in free speech. White supremacists have the right to engage in whatever kind of stupid, racist speech they want to. The Westin Hotel has a right to host whoever they want to host. The Westin Hotel also has the right to refuse to host white supremacists and to stand up for racial equality instead. Anti-racists have the right to let the Westin know what we think of them hosting a racist conference, and we have the right to expose the American Renaissance Conference by calling the hotel and by letting the public know about it. We have the right to refuse to give our business to hotels that host white supremacists and to encourage others not to stay at such hotels. There is a saying, &#8220;the cure for hate-speech is not to limit free speech, but rather, the cure for hate speech is more speech.&#8221; Let&rsquo;s engage in &#8220;more speech&#8221; by calling the hotel and encouraging them to cancel the American Renaissance Conference.</p>

		<p>Sniff.  My feelings are really hurt by the &#8220;drunken, trashy, redneck&#8221; stereotype, but I can&rsquo;t produce a sentence coherent enough to express myself.  </p>
<p>This article is childish, naive, and hypocritical.  It looks as if it were written by a 13-year-old girl.  This is the second text that you have posted with a call to shut down the AR conference.  Is the location at risk of being pulled from the hotel? </p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;m sure many of my AmRen commenters will agree, anything produced by the Mormons treads on dangerous ground when attempting to criticize some other group for either racism or exclusionary thinking. </p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it only some time in the mid-70s or mid-80s that the Mormon Church finally decreed that black men could be admitted to the Mormon &#8220;priesthood&#8221;?</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s final paragraph exposes this article as exactly the sort of censorship it purports not to be. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading scientific material on such science for years and have yet to encounter any actual &#8220;debunking&#8221; of it.  Why does this &#8220;Mormon worker&#8221; not enlighten me and email his reasoning.  Unlike him, my email address is here for all to see.</p>
<p>It is nice that the &#8220;Mormon Worker&#8221; site links to Fred Reed&rsquo;s favorable account of his experience as a speaker at the last conference.  I encourage our readers to add their own comments on that site - being civil and using correct English of course.</p>

		<p>The article states that black inferiority in intelligence and violence is pseudo-science and has long been proven false.  The article gives no evidence showing this to be true and as Jared Taylor has pointed out, all the evidence from IQ tests, SAT scores and history, has shown just the opposite to be true. All standards of measurement have shown blacks to be intellectually inferior and more prone to crime and violence.  This is true in any country, culture or society that blacks reside in.</p>

<p>Yeah, you are against free speech if it is speech you do not like.  What would you say if the $PLC or NAACP were refused conference space at a hotel?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see a by-line but I presume the author, who is advocating against free speech, is white.  I just didn&rsquo;t know there were left-wing anti-white racists Mormons.</p>

		<p>I just called them, and found the counter person to be more than amenable to our point of view.  He shared my view that the boneheads calling to protest the conference are supressing free speech and &#8220;hating on&#8221; real people with real concerns.  He put me through to the manager&rsquo;s voicemail, where I told the manager that those who are calling to mess with the conference are like people who would tell chemists that they &#8220;have to treat all elements as though they are equal&#8221; before starting any intellectual inquiry.  I encouraged him to support the conference and that I would make sure to direct business to him as I saw fit based on his response to this &#8220;bullying&#8221; pressure from those who bow at the altar of diversity.</p>

		<p>As long as diversity stands for discrimination against white men and there is usual accompanying condemnation of white men (because white men discriminate, for one), it is the pro-diversity agenda that is discriminating and engaging in &#8216;hate&rsquo;, and if it makes me a &#8216;Nazi&rsquo; to speak up about this, because we live in a world where oddly enough only white men can never be victims, then so be it.</p>

		<p> It saddens me to see such an addle-pated column posted on a Mormon website, as I hold the Mormons in high regard. Apparently even they have their bad apples.</p>
<p> How amusing that this writer says that the hotels he named would not book the AmRen conference a second time (at least he alleges this, offering no proof whatsoever) because the attendees were supposedly &#8220;racists&#8221; and &#8220;Klansmen.&#8221; If in fact the hotels wouldn&rsquo;t book AmRen a second time, could it have been because of the ruckus and upsetting scene caused by those &#8220;protesting&#8221; their conference, and not because of the conference itself?</p>
<p> And by the way, how does this person know that &#8220;not many women ever show up&#8221;? Did he attend one himself. And lastly, Mr. Mormon Worker, New Century Foundation is a legitimate organization   &mdash;   not a &#8220;cover name.&#8221;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Keystone State skinheads have swastika tattoos, and if any do, that won&rsquo;t be much appreciated at a conference that has had Michael Levin and Michael Hart as speakers.  But I&rsquo;m pretty sure they know how to put their Confederate flag t-shirts in the laundry.  I&rsquo;m a Yankee and I&rsquo;m all in favor of seeing people fly the Confederate flag simply because it upsets the multi-cultis so.  (Those same multi-cultis have no quarrel at all with illegal immigrants flying the Mexican flag and insisting that this is <i>their</i> country.)</p>
<p><i>I encourage anti-racists to call or email the Westin to let them know what the New Century Foundation Conference really is and to encourage hotel management to stand up for racial equality by refusing to host white supremacist gatherings.</i></p>
<p>No matter how often you shout that the Earth is flat that doesn&rsquo;t make it so.  And no often how often you proclaim racial equality every bit of our day to day experience and the vast bulk of the statistical data collected by scientists proves otherwise.</p>
<p><i>Note that I am not arguing for anyone&rsquo;s free speech rights to be violated.</i></p>
<p>Liar.</p>
<p><i>I believe in free speech.</i></p>
<p>Liar.</p>
<p>Every time I here a lefty say he favors free speech I know he&rsquo;s about to follow it up with, &#8220;&hellip; but we must censor those wicked right wingers.&#8221;  So here we go:</p>
<p><i>There is a saying, &ldquo;the cure for hate-speech is not to limit free speech, but rather, the cure for hate speech is more speech.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s engage in &ldquo;more speech&rdquo; by calling the hotel and encouraging them to cancel the American Renaissance Conference.</i></p>
<p>By &#8220;more speech&#8221; he does not propose that the lefties have their own conference to refute whatever was said at the Amren conference.  Nor does he mean an honest debate (which he would lose).  He means censorship.<br>

<p>Funny, this Red rag, &ldquo;The Mormon Worker,&rdquo; has offices in both: Provo, Utah (88.52% White versus 0.46% Black); and Salt Lake City, Utah (67.3% White versus 4.0% Black.) </p>
<p>I ask myself, why not an office in Detroit, LA, or Atlanta too?  </p>
<p>It seems that &ldquo;long-debunked pseudo-science&rdquo; may not dictate editorial racial egalitarianism, quite as well as does superciliously comfortable distances. A case in point, why is the same maudlin self-righteousness not directly applied to Hispanics here, as it is to blacks? </p>
<p>Could it be the fact that Hispanics makeup respectively, 10.5% and 21.5% of Provo&rsquo;s and Salt Lake City&rsquo;s populations?</p>
<p>Oh say it ain&rsquo;t so, Comrades of the Worker Beehive!</p>

		<p>This was posted as a comment to the above article on the &#8220;Mormon Worker&#8221; Lets see if they post it.-<br>
You&rsquo;re publishing names, location and phone number is a blatant attempt to make it impossible for anyone to meet to discuss non-PC views in a lawful manner. Your use of caricatures and racial epithets in the article are further evidence of intent to inflame and defame its participants as well. Your ignorance in science is only exceeded by your unfamiliarity in your own faiths history.  Look up the &#8220;Seed of Cain&#8221;.  To most blacks Mormonism is synonymous with racism and polygamy so you should have no reason to fear peering into others claiming to know their hearts. I guess for you it&rsquo;s never been a Mormon problem that people misunderstood your faith. Fight the good fight brother; don&rsquo;t worry about casting the first stone. You are the most un-educated, bigoted and hate filled Mormon I have ever been exposed to. And as a word of advice on your next job application put an asterisk next to race- white, and let them know that although you&rsquo;re white it&rsquo;s okay because you&rsquo;re Mormon.  You could even say that you&rsquo;re a member of persecuted minority. That&rsquo;ll get you the job!</p>

Sure you&rsquo;re not Mr Unidentified Author. Just what would you call trying to shut down a gathering of like minded, law abiding individuals who have every right to gather? And just how would you and your fellow leftists like it if someone who didnt care for your views, organized an attempt to shut down your gathering? Would you consider that an assault on your rights to free speech and free association? Or would this attempt to silence you be ok with you because those attempting to shut you down disagree with your views?</p>
<p>By the way, its pretty brave of you to write your leftist gibberish anonymously on your website, while REQUIRING anyone who comments on your writing to identify themselves and provide their email address.</p>

		<p>So this is from the &#8220;Mormon Worker&#8221; eh? The Mormons&hellip; are they not the ones who for a century or so said that polygamy was okay? I&rsquo;ll bet for just as long they held racial views that by today&rsquo;s standards would be called &#8220;racist.&#8221; Everyone did.  So much for the &#8220;divinely inspired truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>That goes to show that Christians and members of any religion are just followers, they are not &#8220;leaders.&#8221; For those who say our society&rsquo;s current race denial problems are the fault of Christianity, I say &#8220;poppycock!&#8221; Religion has never revealed the truth. It has always adapted itself to the ebb and flow of societal opinion, not the other way around. </p>
<p>And as far as the claim that blacks being predisposed to having lower IQs is &#8220;pseudoscience,&#8221; notice that those who make this claim never bother to back it up. It also leads to another question, if an IQ difference among the races is scientifically proven, does that make racism okay? </p>
<p>They seem to be implying that &#8220;racism&#8221; is bad only because it&rsquo;s false. Does this not mean that if the racial difference in IQ is proven, then racism can no longer be considered evil? I want to know.</p>

		<p>Predictably, this so-called author hurls the word &#8220;racist&#8221; around like so many seem intent on doing here in 2010.  Of course, with each utterance of the word they are unknowingly diluting it, to the point that it will mean nothing much sooner than we thought.  The attack on the stormfront motto easily misses the hypocrisy.  We can handle the New Black Panthers, sure, but it is sacreligious for anybody in the White community to show any sense of solidarity, even if it involves only 3 words.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Hilariously, Jared Taylor refers to himself as a &ldquo;race relations expert&rdquo;. He also calls himself a &ldquo;race realist&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;race realist&rdquo; is just code for &ldquo;white supremacist&rdquo;</p>
<p>More hilariously, this buffoon fails to even see what he is dealing with.  Race realist DOES NOT equal White supremacist.  I don&rsquo;t think of myself as a White supremacist, as I believe Asians rank higher on the intelligence/model society scale.  I believe Mr. Taylor feels this way as well.  The continued use of the term &#8220;White supremacist&#8221; shows that this simple fact-based belief flies right over the head of these Mor(m)ons.  Surely, Mr. Taylor is more of an expert on race relations than the author of this &#8220;article&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end, this hack is sure to try and cover his tracks by claiming to be for Free Speech.  What nonsense.  This is text-book suppression of the right to Free Speech: they simply seek to not allow others to say what they don&rsquo;t agree with.  This fool is so insecure of himself and his message that he feels the need to list the e-mail and phone number of the Westin two separate times.  </p>
<p>Living only 15 minutes from this Hotel, you can bet your bottom dollar I&rsquo;ll be there on Feb 19-21 (even though the conference falls on my 24th birthday) to personally confront any of these lunatics that dare to show up.  I don&rsquo;t currently have the funds to attend the conference, and don&rsquo;t see my unemployed self obtaining said funds before the 19th&hellip;but I hope to do my part.  I urge my fellow AmRenners who are within striking distance of Dulles to make their presence felt as well.  If you cant go, send an e-mail to the hotel or make a phone call.  Time to stand up!</p>

		<p>I found the last two sentences priceless:  &#8220;There is a saying, &#8216;the cure for hate-speech is not to limit free speech, but rather, the cure for hate speech is more speech.&rsquo; Let&rsquo;s engage in &#8216;more speech&rsquo; by calling the hotel and encouraging them to cancel the American Renaissance Conference.&#8221;</p>
<p>How in heavens could they *not* be limiting free speech by trying to get the Westin to cancel this conference?</p>
<p>These liberal fascists who try to shut down any speech that is politically incorrect (such as deviating from open borders beliefs) are far more a risk to the country than anybody at this conference could ever be.  These people will not stop until we have North Korea-style limitations on our freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Amren would do well to quote and ridicule the Mormon Worker&rsquo;s support for open borders: &#8220;Considered from an eternal perspective, we realize that borders are simply man-made artifices. Separating families through immigration laws, promoting pride under the guise of nationalism and creating insurmountable economic restrictions, borders take away our agency and thwart God&rsquo;s plan.&#8221; and &#8220;The very concept of borders creates false divisions that segregate the human family, cultivating an attitude of prejudice toward those who would otherwise be neighbors.&#8221; (Source: https://www.themormonworker.org/articles/issue7/immigration-by-tyler-bushman.php)  </p>
<p>Same page shows their nutty anti-American, pro-World Government beliefs as well: &#8220;Oh, I want to do away with nationalism as well. So I guess the idea of national security won&rsquo;t exist.&#8221;<br>

It is only &#8220;racists&#8221; who want to save the most successful nation in history. Look what &#8220;tolerance&#8221; has brought us. A president who is unqualified by birth and merit, failing overcrowded schools, rampant gang crime, a failing economy, massive unemployment, &#8220;no go&#8221; areas around the country. loss of social cohesion and national idenity. Only fools fail to see what is rapidly destroying our country. Its masssive immigration of unskilled non whits and Muslims who despise traditional U.S. culture.&#8221;Tolerance&#8221; is lack of insight, judgement and discernment.The writer of this piece is typical of all too many who are blind fools who recognize danger only when it slaps them in the face.

		<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that a Mormon affiliated organisation should be throwing that silly word &#8216;white supremacist&rsquo; around.<br>
 As we all know the Latter Day Saints officially forbade the non-white races of the world membership until 1978 when forced to do so by US Government threats.Both Joseph Smith and particularly Brigham Young had some very choice things to say about blacks and amerindians.The Book of Mormon itself is quite disparaging of &#8216;dusky races&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>My frustration to the &#8220;reactions&#8221; to the conference is complex.  I am frustrated because (1) &#8220;Hate speech&#8221; has a connotation of ONLY white speech against anyone else, never the reverse.  Any other race or ethnicity attacking white people is viewed as &#8220;letting off steam of suppression.&#8221;  That is ludicrous.  (2) The hotel has no Constitutional obligation to host the conference - ONLY the government can violate Constitutional rights.  The hotel is only bound by contract.  And ethics.  (3)  The &#8220;reactions&#8221; to the conference and the attendees (including me: a female attorney) have been nothing but paranoia and white hate.  Period.  Of WHAT are these people so afraid?  (4) Free speech has many theoretical bases - One of which is the marketplace of ideas theory - which states information in the public dialogue will be &#8220;bought or not&#8221; as &#8220;true or not&#8221; by the listener-market.  These &#8220;critics&#8221; (who, as I have pointed out in other forums, are illiterate, illogical and ignorant) fear &#8220;ideas&#8221; - As an educated woman, I fear no &#8220;idea.&#8221;  None.  I welcome ideas - because I THINK and THEREFORE can evaluate an idea.  These &#8220;critics&#8221; have no point but the silencing of ideas from a certain population.  Me.  My people.  Why?  (6) The FACTS have consistently shown the people evolving this planet are white-Europeans.  Period.  We are a threat as a juxtaposition to thier near collective inability to offer anything of value.  As long as they keep perpetuating the underdog, poor me, suppressed person of color nonsense, they will continue to dupe the liberal bleeding hearts into giving them help and chances and affirmative action.  True competition would Darwin these people out of existence.  Personal responsibility is what they fear.  If welfare was gone, how many of us would panic?  None.  Because WE take personal responsiblity.  We do not have 16 kids from 16 men and complain we do not have food for them.  Our men would not do that in any event.  We get educated, earn degrees and skills, and take care of ourselves and each other.  It is time to take a stand.  It is time to demand true equality and let them compete on our field.  That is what they fear.  </p>

<p>No they&rsquo;re not. The Westin Hotel is a private business in a free-market economy, and the Mormon Worker is trying to convince the Westin Hotel that enough people will boycott them if they host the Amren conference that they&rsquo;ll lose money.

<p>That having been said, both &#8220;sides&#8221; are guilty of wanting to suppress free speech.  It&rsquo;s okay to have free speech as long as you agree with them, basically.  You have the pro-war crowd trying to shut down those against the Iraq war (though some are against it only because it&rsquo;s the party line  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m against it because it&rsquo;s unconstitutional), then you have the pro-abortion crowd trying to shut down pro-lifers.</p>

We missed out on what was no doubt a good president because of this in the last election, as people were afraid of one person whose religion started with an M, but settled for another whose religion started with the same letter, if you get my drift.

		<p>I&rsquo;m black and I plan to call Westin to personally endorse this conference.  I could care less if Jared Taylor is racist, I think he&rsquo;s an excellent writer and that almost everything he says is true.  The average IQ differences between the races has not been debunked.  Societies can be ranked, with Asian societies at the top.  Blacks are more prone to violence.  Rap is disgusting and disrespectful to women, with its repeated use of bitch and ho.  </p>
<p>Liberals only care about anti-black speech.  They don&rsquo;t care about sexist speech, especially if the speaker is a minority.  They don&rsquo;t care about anti-white speech that&rsquo;s for darn sure.  They are hypocrites and fools.  Most of all they are sissified wimps who are afraid to be considered racist.</p>

<p>Yeah, I like what the Keystone State Skinheads are doing, too.  They&rsquo;ve got guts and know their survival is at stake.  Not that Mormons would understand that, nor the multitudes of what-nots that have swarmed to the land of my Fathers for their own survival.</p>

		<p>As a long-time inactive Mormon, I&rsquo;m not up-to-date with the church&rsquo;s social positions. However, I visited Utah last year and was disappointed to see signs of the multi-racial rot. Like a traditional Mormon family, a young couple with four beautiful little White children - and a black one. Apparently the mania for adopting African orphans has arrived in the Promised Land. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m certain this article is not representative of Mormons in general.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of The Mormon Worker.  I went to the original article, and the comments there are overwhelmingly against the article. Only the author and one or two others are &#8220;arguing&#8221; his case - if you can call calling people racists an argument. Or asserting that IQ is determined by environment, without any evidence.  Lots of facts, logic and supporting links from the side of the angels, though. Interesting reading, recommended.</p>
<p>The author posts under the name of Tariq, so apparently not a White man.</p>

<p>Note to the Mormon Worker, if you&rsquo;re calling the hotel in protest and urging others to do the same, you are attempting to suppress free speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No they&rsquo;re not. The Westin Hotel is a private business in a free-market economy, and the Mormon Worker is trying to convince the Westin Hotel that enough people will boycott them if they host the Amren conference that they&rsquo;ll lose money. Do you think you have a legal right to rent a conference hall even if the owners decide they don&rsquo;t want you to? That sounds a lot like marxism to me.</p>
<p>Try and justify it all you want. Window dress it however you feel. But harassing the Hotel is nothing more than an attempt to suppress the free speech of AmRen. If you truly valued free speech or even believed in it, you would not interfere.</p>
<p>The Westin can do whatever they please as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. If they feel morally obligated to deny AmRen a conference because they actually stand against the message of AmRen, I can respect that. That being said, they should be able to make that decision on their own.. not from the whining of people who will probably never stay there in their lifetime anyway.</p>
<p>You can make any righteous cause look bad if you have enough people protest against it. </p>

		<p>This sort of attempt at economic extortion of businesses that are willing to do business with American Renaissance seems to be a new development.  It has only been the last couple of conferences that have faced this, correct?  </p>
<p>Hopefully, Westin will hang in there.  But its probably a huge hassle taking all the extra calls and negative publicity, and they would not be unjustified and asking for extra money when they contracted with the New Century Foundation.  I don&rsquo;t know how to deal with this worsening problem.  Amren needs allies in the hotel/convention business.  </p>

Note that I am not arguing for anyone&rsquo;s free speech rights to be violated. I&rsquo;m not calling for any laws to force these trashy racists to keep quiet. I&rsquo;m not calling for any laws to force the hotel to refuse to host racist conferences. I believe in free speech. White supremacists have the right to engage in whatever kind of stupid, racist speech they want to. The Westin Hotel has a right to host whoever they want to host. </b></p>
<p>You DON&rsquo;T believe in free speech.  You are not comfortable with views of pro-white movements.  If you were, you would not be telling people we were having a conference.  You are the supremacist, not us.  You think you are supreme and better than we are.  That&rsquo;s bigotry, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p><b>Yeah, you are against free speech if it is speech you do not like. What would you say if the $PLC or NAACP were refused conference space at a hotel?</b></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a complete, utter lie.  Who said that?  Where is your documentation? When has Mr. Taylor ever tried to shut down the ADL or the SPLC or La Raza or the Black Panther Party of the millions of other non-white groups who hate white people while championing their own race?</p>
<p>The more exposure you give to people you hate (yes, you hate us, admit it), the more power and attention you give us.  If you don&rsquo;t like someone, don&rsquo;t pay attention to them or support them.  It&rsquo;s that simple.  That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t watch movies with blacks in them (because most of them hate whites and are trying to play the race card), that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t listen to Tim Wise, that&rsquo;s why when I go see a comedy routine I won&rsquo;t go if it&rsquo;s a black or non-white performing.</p>

		<p>Whoa there Tim in Indiana! First, Mormonism has nothing to do with Christianity. period. And secondly, ALL truth is in Christianity. For the purpose of this discussion, we&rsquo;ll start with the FACT that God is a &#8216;racist&rsquo;. He created them all and plainly tells us in Genesis that His plan demands &#8216;kind after kind&rsquo;. Read Nehemiah also. God strictly forbids inter-racial marriage.<br>
Secondly, why do you think that &#8216;they&rsquo; continue to try to have the Bible labeled as &#8216;hate speech&rsquo; and censor it? Other than &#8216;them&rsquo; profiting from immorality and having a genetic abhorrence to that which is right, &#8216;they&rsquo; see the demand for separation of races and recognition of certain racial superiorities therein. It is of course imperative to understand &#8220;who is who and who aint&#8221;, but even that missing, the call for separation is there. I suggest you study a bit before spouting off such uninformed, &#8220;pop&#8221; pseudo - intellectualism</p>

		<p>Having lived in the Salt Lake Valley for about 6 years now I have seen quite a bit of the hypocracy of the LDS church. For example, to get statehood the church had to outlaw polygamy, of course to hear it from the missionaries they had &#8220;a revelation from God&#8221; to end the practice. There been more changes to the church than this limited forum can enumerate. There has been quite a bit of immigration to the valley, Hispanics and Samoans are the dominant groups but there are others such as Bosnian Muslims who, while White, have their own issues. The working class neighborhood I moved into 5 years ago has turned into South Central LA and we are desparate to move. </p>
<p>I will say that the LDS people I have met and are friends with are wonderful caring people but I think that their caring will ruin Salt Lake and Utah in general in a few years. </p>

		<p>The mormon worker can,t have it both ways. Stating they believe in<br>
free speech and then wanting the host hotel to shutdown the conferance. Besides the attendees are not racists they are standing up for their racial interests. Like every other minority group does in the USA. When it&rsquo;s done by a minority they call it diversity.</p>

		<p>I remembered that I attended a conference in Washington,DC<br>
sponsored by the American Southern Africa Council that featured<br>
speakers whom were US Congressmens, and Senators in support for<br>
White&rsquo;s in Rhodesia. There were demonstrators that surrounded <br>
the hotel that were mostly white communist, and socialists.,<br>
and very liberal young democrats.<br>
Very few blacks were seen. What really hurt was that the<br>
Police Chief of DC said on the news that he sympathized with<br>
the demonstrators. He was white. That was 1968.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;As a Mormon, I am fairly confident that these opinions are not representative of the Mormon people. I don&rsquo;t know what &#8216;The Mormon Worker&rsquo; is supposed to be, but I find this embarrassing&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>As I was reading this I immediately thought &#8220;False Flag&#8221;, something the $PLC has been known to do in order to stir up blacks against Whites, Whites against other Whites  &mdash;  fill in the black racial/ethnic group vs. Whites.  The greedy $PLC uses false flag tactics to scare their major donors into coughing up more money into its bottomless coffers. </p>
<p>I hope that true Mormons have nothing to do with this.  Could you please, Anon #31, alert the Mormon organization as to what is being written in its name?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I think I&rsquo;ll send them an unsolicited e-mail of my own!&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t hesitate!  I wrote a e-mail a few days ago, thanked them for hosting the AmRen conference and promised they would receive my business and that of my family  &mdash;  I told them I will make a point of patronizing the Westin and its affiliates when I travel.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take more than a few minutes and I used my real name.</p>
<p>Their bottom line is MONEY and if enough of us threaten to pull our business and refuse to patronize their hotels, it will get their attention FAST.  How long could they possibly survive without White business?  Would blacks and hispanics make up for lost White business? </p>
<p>Please everyone  &mdash;  call or e-mail the Dulles Westin, thank them for hosting the AmRen conference and tell them you will pull your business if they cancel the AmRen conference.</p>
<p>There is strength in numbers, something we Whites MUST start using  &mdash;  these companies well know they will die without our business.  I have learned from my Jewish relatives and do what they do  &mdash;  ask this, always:  Is It Good For Whites?.</p>
<p>Let that be your motto, let your voice be heard before its really too late  &mdash;  ask our Canadian neighbors about Free Speech.  </p>
<p>Otherwise the Bolsheviks win, silence us permanently, which they&rsquo;re working on, and we will be an incarnation of The Old Soviet State.</p>

		<p>I see no name of the author on the above article. Obviously he doesn&rsquo;t want his name attached to such a rediculous rant which tells of his own childish hate and racism and lack of tolerance for anyone else that has a differing opinion from his.<br>
   To try and shut people up means you don&rsquo;t have enough courage and intelligence to dispute the issues and are scared to death that AMREN and it&rsquo;s supporters are 100% right about everything.<br>
   No matter what the author says, he is indeed against freedom of speech and if everybody else was like him his stupid article would have never been published in the Mormon Worker or here in AMREN. Supression of speech by bullying and threatening supporters of organizations like AMREN has been tried all over the world by dictators that thought they were God but totally failed to squelch the human spirit and it&rsquo;s not going to happen here. I will guarantee that motel owners and other hosts of AMREN will welcome them with open arms and take extreme offense at left wing commie pig pukes like the author above. I strongly suggest that the author move to North Korea where they think just like him.      </p>
