<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/10/islam-channel-radical-cleric-awlaki">UK Muslim TV Channel Linked to Al-Qaida Cleric Al-Awlaki</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamie Doward, Guardian (London), January 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A London-based satellite broadcaster that describes itself as &#8220;the voice of authority for Muslims in the UK&#8221; has been accused of giving a platform to Anwar al-Awlaki, the extremist cleric with alleged links to al-Qaida and to the man charged with trying to blow up a transatlantic jet on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>The Islam Channel, a free-to-air English-language channel that claims to be &#8220;a trustworthy source to the two million-plus population of Muslims in the UK&#8221;, last year carried adverts for a box set of DVDs of Awlaki&rsquo;s sermons and for at least two events at which the cleric was due to be the star speaker via a video link.</p>
<p>The channel&rsquo;s website has allowed visitors to click through to a pooled archive of Islamic scholars, from which they can download sermons by Awlaki, including &#8220;Stop Police Terror&#8221;, &#8220;Brutality Towards Muslims&#8221; and &#8220;It&rsquo;s a War against Islam&#8221;.</p>
<p>Islamic scholars have expressed concern. &#8220;Anwar al-Awlaki is asking all Muslims to unite against the west as Muslims,&#8221; said Dr Irfan al-Alawi of the Centre for Islamic Pluralism. &#8220;He supports jihad to ensnare all naive, young people who get emotionally attached and go on jihadist tirades.&#8221;</p>
<p>US intelligence agencies claim Awlaki is a key member of al-Qaida. Last week John Brennan, the US deputy national security adviser, said there were &#8220;indications&#8221; there had been direct contact between Awlaki and Umar Abdulmutallab, the 23-year-old former University College London student charged with trying to set off a bomb on a flight bound for Detroit on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Awlaki has also been linked to an attack by a US army major, Nidal Malik Hasan, last November, in which 13 people died. &#8220;Mr Awlaki is a problem,&#8221; Brennan said. &#8220;He&rsquo;s clearly a part of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. He&rsquo;s not just a cleric. He is trying to instigate terrorism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Awlaki, a US-born engineer-turned-cleric, is now based in Yemen, where some reports suggest he was killed just before Christmas in a strike on a suspected al-Qaida base. His family insist he was not harmed in the raid.</p>
<p>Leading British Muslim organisations, including the Islamic Society of Britain, have promoted Awlaki&rsquo;s lectures in the past, but now condemn his views.</p>
<p>Haras Rafiq of Centri, a counter-extremism consultancy, said Awlaki&rsquo;s online influence over young radicals was becoming a serious concern. &#8220;The internet has by far overtaken TV as the favourite pastime of youngsters in countries such as the UK and the ability for people to download Awlaki&rsquo;s sermons is helping to provide radicalisation on demand,&#8221; Rafiq said.</p>
<p>The channel&rsquo;s chief executive officer, Mohamed Ali Harrath, has been on an Interpol wanted list since 1992, after his native Tunisia accused him of attempting to create &#8220;an Islamic state by means of armed revolutionary violence&#8221;. Harrath denies the charges.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the channel said it had been unaware its website had provided links to Awlaki&rsquo;s sermons. She said the sermons were in an online archive shared with many websites. &#8220;Islam Channel has not at any time given a platform to Mr Awlaki,&#8221; she said. The channel has now removed the link.</p>
<p>Maajid Nawaz, a former presenter on the Islam Channel who is now director of the counter-extremism thinktank Quilliam, said: &#8220;Islam Channel is beamed into thousands of Muslim homes every night. With such influence, however, comes responsibility.&#8221;<br>

		<p>So what does it take, Brittanicas, for you to learn that you can&rsquo;t trust a Muslim?  What, you took his WORD?  And I always thought British people were smart because they speak such beautiful English!  Wow - since Islam is the religion of war (just check the ahidith - the commentaries on the Quran that are just as valid as the Quran; there you will find that EVERY MUSLIM is enjoined to forcibly convert non-Muslims; if they won&rsquo;t convert, force them to be 2nd class citizens; if they won&rsquo;t accept that, then make WAR against them and kill them.)  The &#8220;them&#8221; is US, folks - all us non-Muslims.  And it&rsquo;s the British, the French, the Spanish, the Germans   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s the entire world that isn&rsquo;t Muslim.  They want to run the world, and will stop at nothing to implement that goal.</p>

		<p>Slowly the Brits are waking up i think. The election of 2010 is very important. If we get MP&rsquo;s which is quite likely, things may start to change. This station would be off the air and heavely fined for a start.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a sad thing to say, because I&rsquo;ve been friends with Muslims and met many pleasant Muslim individuals (it isn&rsquo;t conceivable that 1/5 or 1/4 of the world&rsquo;s population could ALL be bad, is it?), but on matters regarding Islam (and especially its social and political ambitions) you can NEVER believe a word they say.</p>
<p>This is because of the Islamic principle of TAQIYYA (there are various transliterations into English). Do an Internet search for the definition.</p>
