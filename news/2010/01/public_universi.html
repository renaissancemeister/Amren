<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The entering and graduating classes at many of the nation&rsquo;s leading public universities are looking less and less like the state populations they were founded to serve, a report said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The follow-up to a 2006 analysis of federal data concludes that 50 public flagships, one in each state, &#8220;continue to enroll students who are far richer and far whiter&#8221; than most in their states, says Kati Haycock, director of the non-profit Education Trust, which released both reports.</p>
<p>Findings note some positive trends. From 2003 to 2007, average institution grants increased by 23%, to $4,910, for students with the lowest 20% of family incomes, under $30,201. They decreased by 4% on average, to $4,158, for those in the top 20%, over $115,399.</p>

		<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, then I would say the graduating classes are starting to represent the people who really have the brains, instead of those who &#8220;bought&#8221; their degrees via affirmative action.  GOOD!!!!  It&rsquo;s about time.  People who put education first in their lives deserve to get the diplomas   &mdash;   not those who slide through with majors like &#8220;Hispanic Studies&#8221;, &#8220;Black Studies,&#8221; &#8220;Women&rsquo;s Studies,&#8221; and my personal fave, &#8220;Liberal Arts.&#8221;  Those are the folks who, when informed that their roomie just bought a new toilet brush, reply, &#8220;Yes, I noticed, but I still prefer the paper.&#8221;</p>

		<p> Oh, what a terrible, heart-breaking tragedy! Our colleges are heavily infested with students who are too prosperous and too White! The next thing they&rsquo;ll be telling us is that we nasty, racist old Caucasians founded this country, instead of the blacks, Mexicans and Indians who actually did.</p>
<p> Maybe Obama will come to the rescue by issuing an executive order to admit all nine million Haitians as permanent, legal residents, pronto! Then next year they can gin up some special grants and race-normed admission standards so all of them can enter our colleges, thereby &#8220;darkening them up&#8221; appropriately. We&rsquo;ve got to do something about this shameful invasion of U.S. academia by privileged Whites!</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s the other way around.  It&rsquo;s not that the schools are becoming un-diverse compared to the state&rsquo;s population, it&rsquo;s that the state&rsquo;s population is getting diverse compared to the school&rsquo;s enrollment.</p>
<p>And all this is in spite of affirmative action (or equivalent mechanisms) in admissions.</p>

		<p>As someone who spends alot of time and speaks on college campuses (yes there are conservatives who do so) I can tell you firsthand that this is becoming more and more the case.</p>
<p>Colleges and univeristes are becoming more and more upscale and affluent. This is especially true in regards to liberal arts colleges. The Blacks and Hispanics you see are overwhelmingly from upper class backgrounds. </p>

		<p>While this is probably true as I see it happening on my college campus, the fact is that many of these affluent students tend to be more liberal in their behavior and beliefs. You see a considerable amount of interracial friendships, interracial couples and same sex couples.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think this study is looking at the Freshman classes of these public colleges.  The University of Texas only accepts students who in the top ten percent of their school&rsquo;s GPA.  Assuming all universities have similar standards for their Freshman classes and you combine this with other Affirmative Action measures and nepotistic actions by college alumnus on the parts of their groups, then that grade, at least, reflects true &#8220;diversity.&#8221;  </p>
<p>However, they aren&rsquo;t called Freshman Weed Out Classes for nothing.  The sophomore year is more White.  Moreover, the White kids who didn&rsquo;t make the cut for the Freshman year have enrolled for the Sophomore, usually the Junior year.  Colleges are a lot more flexible about accepting credits from what used to be called Junior Colleges or what we now call Community Colleges. The universities now work closely with the community colleges so that the students can at least transfer over with all their core classes credited and out of the way. Moreover, many community colleges work with the high schools so that students can get dual credits and actually graduate with some core class credits.</p>
<p>White parents can not only bypass the draconian Affirmative Action measures that would bar their children from a higher education if they get creative, they can save a ton of money.  Even if your child is not in the top ten percent, s/he can still take AP high school classes, take dual credits, KLEP out of several classes and take enough lower class electives to transfer to universities as juniors or close to seniors.  Your child can still graduate from a prestigious name university without incurring staggering college loans.  Or s/he can even afford to get their masters at the same price a bachelor&rsquo;s would have cost them or less.</p>
<p>It only goes to show you, where there&rsquo;s a will, there&rsquo;s a way.</p>

		<p>Were America&rsquo;s public colleges founded for the benefit of people from places like Mexico, India, and Africa?  Politicians and various special interest groups want tens of millions of poor people from around the world to come to America, and then pretend to be shocked by the number of poor non-whites in the country.  </p>

		<p> I&rsquo;m sure Ms. Kati Haycock, director of the Education Trust who issued this report, believes that some mysterious environmental cause is resposible for why public universities are becoming whiter while the rest of the population is becoming browner.  If you were to ask her what could be done to rectify this, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d say that all we need is more affirmative action, more multiculturalism, more outreach programs to minorities, more black studies departments; yada,yada,yada&hellip; And if we make add these enhancements, public universities will become just as &#8216;diverse&rsquo; as the general population and the stubborn acheivement gap between the races will disappear!! The only problem with this line of thinking is that we&rsquo;ve been trying the aforementioned enhancemetns for 40+ years now and have nothing to show for them. Of course we all could consider the possiblity that a smaller percentage of  blacks and mestizos are genetically programmed to have IQs above say, 115 compared with whites, and this is mainly why college enrollments are the way they are. But that would be, heaven forbid, &#8216;racist.&rsquo; So let&rsquo;s just allow the general population continue to darken through immigration and differential fertility rates (thanks to gov&rsquo;t welfare programs) &#8216;cause there&rsquo;s nothing to worry about!!!!</p>

<p>Are you surpised by this? Given that many of these kids were born in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they have been indoctrinated with nothing but multicultural, interracial, pro gay and lesbian lifestyles and other garbage sine they were able to read and write.</p>

		<p>Higher education is becoming a luxury.  Very vew college degrees actually improve earning potential.  The ROI is terrible.  I was talking to an old (not older, just old) colleague the other day about this.  He said he&rsquo;d like to retire but he has two kids in college, so he can&rsquo;t afford it.  I asked him why he is paying so much when college degrees don&rsquo;t pay off any more.  He said its for the experience.  Of course, an old liberal white guy.  Only goofy white people would pay 100K for their kids to have a &#8220;valuable experience&#8221;.</p>

		<p>This may look good on paper, but these same colleges are only turning out more young, impressionable, brainwashed, bleeding heart white liberal morons. Statistics have shown that that over 50% of America&rsquo;s tenured college professors are foreign-born; many of middle eastern descent. You can&rsquo;t tell me there isn&rsquo;t a design and an agenda for this. This does not bode well for [the former] America&rsquo;s future.</p>

		<p>Recomment 11  &mdash;  -It is of tangential relevance to note that<br>
Sir Cyril Burt in the UK always emphasized the value of IQ<br>
tests for detecting deserving children (say, among the non-white<br>
and poor ).  No few of the white undergrads at the university<br>
campus I&rsquo;m sitting within right now would be a better credit to<br>
their own ethnicity and our society  ifif  they were in trade school or a skilled apprenticeship program as distinct from filling their campus chairs with deserving &#8220;other&#8221;  Part of what<br>
makes the multi-cultural campus delusionsal world possible is the<br>
lack of brains and spine in many of the majority students. </p>

		<p>Students who are not college material (remember that term?) are probably beginning to realize that getting into college does not necessarily mean graduating from college.  And, after decades of affirmative action and its skewed results, many employers are undoubtedly less likely to hire minorities.  Tuition costs are up, and the certainty of employment is down.  Many blacks and Hispanics have probably become unenamoured with the whole deal.</p>

		<p>The danger is still prevalent. Statistics show that just over 50% of America&rsquo;s college professors are foreign born. That isn&rsquo;t an accident. And the wealthier white collage age are perfect robots: teachable, liberal, impressionable, naive, starry-eyed do-gooders who are systematically brain washed. It doesn&rsquo;t bode well for the [former] USA.</p>

<p>Yes, for many liberal/left, sixties leftover professors looking out over the classroom the first day of the Semester and seeing a sea of white faces is disagreeable as stepping in cow manure. I wonder why these former civil rights activists don&rsquo;t leave and teach in Haiti. They could rebuild a devastated country and &#8220;make a difference&#8221;, and yet they don&rsquo;t appear to be leaving do they?</p>

<p>Well, well, well.  I thought the media wasn&rsquo;t supposed to notice a person&rsquo;s race.  Out of one side of their mouths they tells us to ignore race and out of the other they never quit pointing out the difference in the various races.</p>
<p>And by complaining about whites succeeding aren&rsquo;t they really telling us that blacks just can&rsquo;t cut it?</p>
<p>Of course they are, but they blow it all off as white oppression and racism.</p>
<p>Do they concentrate heavily on black failure, calling it discrimination, because they think by doing so they are really cowards who are afraid of blacks and believe such positions will make them less likely to be targets by blacks?  In other words, is it because they&rsquo;re grovelling cowards?<br>

<p>An ironic leading sentence, no? I know she didn&rsquo;t mean it this way but it is true that the whites who founded these schools to educate an almost all-white population probably never imagined  a day when people would complain about too many white kids at university.</p>

		<p>That leftists control the college curriculum that is taught is a given and that&rsquo;s the fact that racially conscious White parents have to deal with on the ground.  Why allow either yourselves and/or children to go over your heads in debt simply for the college &#8220;brainwashing&#8221; experience?</p>
<p>White families go out of their minds to get their kids into these places in the freshman year.  This does not only set your finances on a disastrous course.  Your children are the most impressionable at this point.  They have had little to no exposure to the outside world and they are like fresh meat to be chewed up by these Marxist maniacs.</p>
<p>I strongly encourage White parents to bypass the major universities as long as possible.  Your child&rsquo;s sheepskin is still going to show them as a graduate of the University of Big Hairy Deal whether s/he enrolls in their freshman year or transfers over in their junior to senior year.  Why not cut the costs of extended education by better than half or more through dual credits, KLEP credits and getting as many of the core courses and junior electives out of the way in community college?  Just work closely with advisors to make sure they all transfer.  That way whatever your child learns in these universities at the exorbitant prices they charge is only what s/he needs.  Or s/he can even diversify  in their specialty by getting a double or triple major or even a masters or doctorate for the same price.  </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s some of the best news I heard (or read) in a while!</p>
<p>I mean, in a predominantly White nation like the US, where public universities are payed for (at least in part) using the taxes of mostly White tax-payers, it&rsquo;s only fair that most of the students coming out of such institutions with a degree be White, right?</p>
