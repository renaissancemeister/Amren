		<p>In 1915 America sent its Marines into Haiti for the purpose of establishing civil order and to protect American interests in that dangerously close nation. The White man then picked up and shouldered his burden. </p>
<p>By the time the Marines left Haiti in 1934, the White man had rebuilt Haiti&rsquo;s entire essential infrastructure. Within a few short years that infrastructure reverted to the heap of disorderly rubble that is normal for that country.</p>
<p>Now, this time Haiti is to be rebuilt under the auspices of the entire world. Should any result other than than that which followed 1934 be expected?</p>

As much as I believe that blacks are wholly responsible for their place and condition in the world, I can&rsquo;t hold them at fault for an earthquake. There but for the grace of God go I.</p>
<p>However, I do fault them for not having basic services in place in their country that could respond to a natural disaster. Yes, Port-au-Prince was devastated but the rest of the island seems to be largely unaffected. Had they had a functioning society, it should have been relatively easy to relocate people to other areas. </p>
<p>Remember when the neighboring town of New Orleans was accused of blocking the bridge to prevent being overwhelmed by refugees? Why aren&rsquo;t neighboring communities accepting refugees? If they are, it isnt being reported.</p>

		<p>How revealing are these photos!  Basically, they are of two types. 1) Haitians looting and 2) Haitians sitting around doing nothing to help themselves.  Utterly pathetic.  We will send billions and billions more of dollars so these lazy people can continue to refuse to do so much as lift a finger to help themselves.</p>

		<p>Tired of hearing about Haiti 24/7 The problem with Haiti is the Haitians themselves. They whine and cry that we aren&rsquo;t doing enough to get supplies to them. Yet try to tell them it is because there is no way to get the supplies to them due to the infrastructure that is all but impassable! The only way for now is to drop it from helicopters, yet they and our media try to ignore this fact!</p>

		<p>Where to begin with this? First, I can&rsquo;t find a way to fault the photojournalism aspect of this; lyin&rsquo; eyes and lyin&rsquo; lenses tell some truth. Second, I can&rsquo;t find it within my heart to make callous commentary about most of the human beings and their sufferings depicted in this photo gallery. Third, I have no idea whatsoever what this photojournalist and/or editors may have omitted from the events witnessed by the photographers.</p>
<p>And finally, I reflect on the eco-geological science aspects of this natural AND manmade disaster. It&rsquo;s not as if the geological science hadn&rsquo;t been availble for the last 200 years regarding the seismic characteristics of the area in question. It&rsquo;s not as if it shouldn&rsquo;t be axiomatically clear that the land mass of Haiti (even under the finest administration) shouldn&rsquo;t be home to 10+ million people of any race.</p>
<p>And you know what? We can say almost the same for California west of the San Andreas fault.</p>

		<p>Oh my God, what an unbelievably striking, unbelievably sad picture. Not only is the destruction wrought by the earthquake sad, but the fact that the church to me symbolizes the destruction wrought to European civilization and what Europeans have built when the builders are no longer around to keep it up.</p>
<p>What also strikes me is the incredible similarity that Haitian church has to  the First Methodist church in Gary, after the white congregation moved away (read were forced out by an exploding crime rate). The really sad thing is that the Gary church was not the victim of an earthquake, just the long slow forces of decay and neglect in a black city. See the picture of the Gary church sanctuary here and see if you don&rsquo;t see the similarities:</p>

		<p>This one photo at the heading looks much like a photo of a church taken and shown on the photo journey of Deadtroit and chiCONGO&hellip;can&rsquo;t blame an earthquake there. But, Haiti and those two cities have one thing in common (besides being dangerous ghettos)What is it they have in common? ((theme of jeopardy is playing))</p>

		<p>What happened in Haiti is a tragedy of epic proportion.  Sadly, much of the tragedy could have been averted had the buildings been built to withstand earthquakes.  Most of them were substandard and could not have withstood even a minimal quake.  Graft and corruption is mostly responsible here with builders building the most minimal structures and profiting the difference and government officials looking the other way.  </p>
<p>Haitians are like children, an African people who have always been dependent on Western know how and aid.  But at least the majority of them live there and have not &#8216;graced&rsquo; this country.  The best thing that the West can do is to help rebuild Haiti and reestablish its infrastructure and order.  The alternative will be an overwhelming flood of refugees to our borders which will be utimately much more expensive to handle in the long run.</p>

		<p>The picture that got to me was the one showing them sitting around playing dominos. All of them looked heathy, well fed and very able to help with the clean up. They were also SPOTLESSLY clean and well groomed. But they sit there playing dominos while the whole world [ mainly Whites ] are rushing there and breaking their backs to get Haiti up and running again. It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re saying - let us know when you guys get eveything going again and we&rsquo;ll need to have our meals delivered here. If I were one of those who went there to help [ hey, work with me folks ] and saw able bodied grown ?men? laying around like that, I&rsquo;d be on the next flight out. It&rsquo;d be interesting to be able to listen to what&rsquo;s being said behind closed doors by some of these relief workers. Hopefully someone who was there will post what was REALLY going on like they did for Katrina. </p>

		<p>Looking at those pictures what most took me was all those Haitians just standing around DOING NOTHING while a few Whites were doing all the rescuing. Was there any reason why all those hundreds of Haitian males just stood there while those three White Belgians rescued that woman? Any reason WHY they couldn&rsquo;t have lent a hand? </p>

		<p>For a even more graphic and realistic view of the Haiti situation, tune into the Spainish network, Telemundo. Their news shows have run just unbelievable footage. It is revealing on two levels; first how much the US MSN varnishes the news, and second, how the Hispanic culture is more willing to view these images. They have shown some just horrifying images.</p>

Shouldn&rsquo;t these White Christians and their orgs that always go into these 3rd world nations do something constructive and logical for once? Family planning won&rsquo;t help because they will never practice it. Condoms were a waste that they at one time gave to these people. </p>
<p>Sterilization is the only solution. You may find that appalling, but what I find appalling is that we have been sending aid and $$$ for decades and decades now and they just keep multiplying and the consequences of that is even more suffering and even more $$$$ year after year. Shouldn&rsquo;t that tell us we are doing something wrong?  But try telling that to today&rsquo;s Christian.</p>

<p>True, and look at the picture about halfway down the page, of looters continuing their &#8220;work&#8221; over the body of another looter who has just been shot. They are all dressed in American-style clothing in very good condition, including blue jeans that look like they were picked up off the rack at J.C. Penny&rsquo;s. A few pictures down, a very healthy-looking looter makes off with   &mdash;  not food  &mdash;   but huge rolls of fabric from an earthquake-wrecked store. A few pictures further down we see a man taking part in the looting of a downtown Port-au-Prince store wearing an Obama T-shirt! I could go on and on, but you get the point.</p>
<p>The lying apologists will claim that these people are &#8220;scavenging&#8221; non-essential items because they are &#8220;trying to rebuild their lives,&#8221; but this points to a fundamental difference in the white and black mentality. Whites see helping others as the first priority (and rightly realize that by doing so, they will likely be rewarded eventually with food and other assistance in gratitude). Blacks are unable to take this sort of long-term view. To them, short-term gratification is the only thing that matters.</p>

		<p>The only whites visible, in any of those photos, are those involved in providing aid and keeping order.  The Oregonian recently described Haiti as &#8220;the first black nation in the Western hemisphere&#8221;.  I want to know where we can find a &#8220;white nation&#8221; in ANY hemisphere.  I also want to know why leftists never ask themselves how it came to be that there are virtually no white natives in Haiti.

		<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised to see that the Haitians are sitting around while their White saviors do all the work.  My kind-hearted wife went to help rebuild houses for the victims of Katrina.  A bunch of 50+ year old soft-handed Whites working while Blacks sat in the shade and watched.  Which race is the smarter?</p>

<p>Actually, Chavez did send monetary and medical aid.  Cuba did provide landing and refueling facilities.  China was the first to respond, with Russia and France second and third (two days ahead of the US Marine occupation force).  </p>
<p>In last place were the oil gazillionaires of Saudi Arabia, who didn&rsquo;t send a single dime or band-aid.  </p>
<p>And did coutry-buying tycoon George Soros get involved at all?  We would have heard by now if he did.</p>
