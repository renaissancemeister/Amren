			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), January 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Somali man was charged yesterday with attempting to kill a Danish cartoonist whose depiction of the Prophet Mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban sparked riots across the Muslim world in 2005.</p>
<p>The police said the 28-year-old man, who allegedly has links to Al Qaeda, was shot after he broke into the home of Kurt Westergaard on Friday night, wielding an axe and a knife.</p>
<p>Mr Westergaard, 74, whose five-year-old granddaughter was in the house at the time, locked himself in a specially designed safe room and used an emergency alarm.</p>
<p>Police who arrived at his bungalow in the Danish city of Aarhus said the suspect was shot in the knee and left arm after threatening an officer trying to arrest him.</p>
<p>The man was treated in hospital and was yesterday carried into court on a stretcher. He was charged with attempted murder and remanded in custody. He denied the charge, but reportedly did admit being at the scene.</p>
<p>The Danish security service PET said the intruder was linked to Somali terror organisation al Shabaab as well as Al Qaeda leaders in East Africa.</p>
<p>Jakob Scharf, head of Denmark&rsquo;s intelligence agency, said the man, who had a residency permit for Denmark, is suspected of involvement in terror-related activities in east Africa and had been under surveillance, although not in connection with Westergaard.</p>
<p>Westergaard was one of 12 cartoonists commissioned by the Danish Jyllands-Posten newspaper to produce caricatures of the Muslim prophet.</p>
<p>Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favourable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.</p>
<p>Muslims were particularly incensed by Westergaard&rsquo;s cartoon, which portrayed Mohammed with a bomb in his turban and was seen as extending the caricature of Muslims as terrorists. The images sparked protests across the globe.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether the suspect actually managed to get inside the home of the cartoonist in Denmark&rsquo;s second largest city, 125 miles northwest of Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Westergaard he told his employer, the Jyllands-Posten daily, that the assailant shouted &#8216;revenge&rsquo; and &#8216;blood&rsquo; as he tried to enter the room where he was hiding.</p>
<p>&#8216;My grandchild did fine. It was scary. It was close. Really close. But we did it,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>An umbrella organization for moderate Muslims in Denmark condemned the attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Danish Muslim Union strongly distances itself from the attack and any kind of extremism that leads to such acts,&#8221; the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>Westergaard remains a potential target for extremists nearly five years after his controversial cartoon was published.</p>
<p>He has received death threats and is the subject of an alleged assassination plot.</p>
<p>The case &#8216;again confirms the terror threat that is directed at Denmark and against the cartoonist Kurt Westergaard in particular&rsquo;, Scharf said.</p>
<p>In October, terror charges were brought against two Chicago men whose initial plan called for attacks on Jyllands-Posten&rsquo;s offices. </p>
<p>The plan was later changed to just killing the paper&rsquo;s former cultural editor and Westergaard.</p>
<p>In 2008, Danish police arrested two Tunisian men suspected of plotting to murder Westergaard. Neither suspect was prosecuted. </p>
<p>One of them was deported and the other was released Monday after an immigration board rejected PET&rsquo;s efforts to expel him from Denmark.</p>
<p>Throughout the crisis, then-Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen distanced himself from the cartoons but resisted calls to apologize for them, citing freedom of speech and saying his government could not be held responsible for the actions of Denmark&rsquo;s press.<br>

		<p>I partially blame the media for this.  They&rsquo;re the ones who, day in and day out during the controversy, spread his name around and essentially begged radical Muslims to kill him.  Even PJB was on the wrong side of this issue   &mdash;   his contention was that if Muslims are that &#8220;on edge,&#8221; then we shouldn&rsquo;t enrage them.  My response was that they shouldn&rsquo;t be that edgy and should chill out.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard everything now. They&rsquo;ve turned Denmark into a prison for her own people, with specially-designed &#8220;safe rooms.&#8221; We&rsquo;ve gone from fallout shelters and fear of &#8220;the bomb&#8221; to fear of being murdered in our own homes. Lovely, but dead is dead, no matter which way it happens.</p>

		<p>Hmm. In attacking a cartoonist the Somalian made clear he has absolutely no sense of humor.<br>
Perhaps locked in a cell and forced to watch successive episodes of Seinfeld will compel him to divulge the whereabouts of his accomplices!<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to say that the Danes have learned their lesson about bringing in third world criminals, but then I remember how liberal they are and realize that half the nation could be murdered by Muslims and the multicults would apologize for having to try them for murder and spend immense amounts of time cautioning the survivors to be careful about &#8220;profiling&#8221; Muslims, making sure they didn&rsquo;t regard ALL Muslims the same way.</p>
<p>Somehow, I&rsquo;m thinking they deserve what they&rsquo;re getting, because they&rsquo;ve endangered so many people in order to get their multicultural utopia.  You know, the one nobody wants, but a few screwy-minded white mental cases and many gullible, brainwashed fools.</p>

		<p>This Westergaard is going to have to live like this FOREVER! He was very lucky this time. It is amazing that the man had his granddaughter living with him? Surely Westergaard realizes [he finally realizes now if he did not before??] the peril is in in? Risking the life of a five year old and not taking seriously the villains is a mistake. And once the wheels have been set into motion, there is no stopping them, this will last FOREVER!</p>

		<p>This is what Ialamic immigration has wrought all White nations! Will we ever learn? Now Obama is planning on issuing the Yemen&#8221;ese&#8221; the visa lotteries to come here! Has anyone else noticed the great hurry of late to really really flood our land with Somalis, Africans, Muslims, etc. etc? Think this has been planned for decades now?  Remember what dear ole Teddy said? He was right about one thing. No, we are not being flooded with a &#8220;million&#8221; a year, we are flooded with MILLIONS a year!</p>
<p>    &ldquo;First, our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration remains substantially the same&hellip;. Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset&hellip;. Contrary to the charges in some quarters, [the bill] will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area, or the most populated and deprived nations of Africa and Asia&hellip;. In the final analysis, the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think&hellip;. The bill will not flood our cities with immigrants. It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. It will not relax the standards of admission. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>The &#8220;moderate&#8221; Muslim organization will remain moderate only as long as they are relatively a minority.  When they approach parity in numbers with Danes, they will no longer be moderate.  They will endorse publicly the Fatwa put out on this cartoonist.<br>
A Fatwa is nothing more really than a contract put out for the killing of ANYBODY who displeases Muslim mullahs.</p>

<p>The surrender to Muslims is nearly as swift and complete.</p>

		<p>  Nationalist parties have been gaining strength in Denmark. The situation is far from hopeless. I support the Danish in winning back their country. Every incident like this helps Danes wake up from their multicultural stupor. I&rsquo;m only sorry that Westergaard wasn&rsquo;t armed himself. </p>

MY contention is that they shouldn&rsquo;t even  be here, or anywhere among us, in the first place.  Then let them riot and be as &#8220;edgy&#8221;  as they want.  Who cares?  Let them burn their own cities down!</p>

<p><br>
Interesting point there.  And why do we tolerate it?  Why isn&rsquo;t it ILLEGAL to issue a fatwa, and the persons who endorse it charged with abetting murder?   We certainly would not just allow anybody to put a death contract on someone else. Why do we permit it for Moslems?  There should be criminal charges brought against everyone connected with a fatwa, even if abroad. Let Interpol handle it. Demand their extradition!</p>
<p>Sad to say, we are being far too weak in dealing with these people. They are agggressive and pushy, and we just keep backing down passively. They know this.  Ours is not a winning strategy!</p>

		<p>Is that to be our future? Specially designed safe rooms, because we&rsquo;re not allowed to defend ourselves? Then you can ask - &#8220;Who made it this time? Ok. Let&rsquo;s pray for those who are still outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the way - what if some white nationalists were &#8220;on edge&#8221; like those fanatics, trying to kill people who they deemed offensive – what would the media say? Something like &#8220;Well, don&rsquo;t offend them!&#8221; You bet.</p>
