<h1>Hawaii Considering New Holidays, Parks to Honor Obama</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Nakaso, Honolulu Advertiser, January 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Senate President Colleen Hanabusa wants President Obama&rsquo;s Aug. 4 birthday to be a state holiday, right up there with Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalaniana&rsquo;ole Day, King Kamehameha I Day and even Christmas.</p>
<p>State Rep. Della Au Belatti, D-25th (Tantalus, Makiki, McCully), would like the Jan. 20 date of Obama&rsquo;s presidential inauguration to be forever known in the Islands as Barack Obama II Ohana Day.</p>
<p>And even Republican state Rep. Gene Ward, R-17th, (Kalama Valley, Queen&rsquo;s Gate, Hawai&rsquo;i Kai), hopes to turn 4,124 square feet of overgrown scrub land owned by the state Department of Transportation into President Barack Obama Birthplace State Park.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the state Legislature that&rsquo;s considering resolutions that would bring six new changes in Obama&rsquo;s honor, such as urging the state Board of Education to rename Obama&rsquo;s first school  &mdash;  Noelani Elementary School  &mdash;  President Barack Hussein Obama II Elementary School, and to change the name of McKinley High School to President Barack Hussein Obama II High School.</p>
<p>Renaming one or two public schools in Obama&rsquo;s name makes sense to Rep. Gil Keith-Agaran, D-9th, (Wailuku, Pu&rsquo;unene Makawao), who introduced the resolution, because &#8220;part of his education agenda is to make sure that the next generation has as much opportunity as possible in an economy where we need to compete globally.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another resolution would begin the process to place the rental apartment building on Beretania Street where Obama&rsquo;s grandparents lived on to the National Register of Historic Places.</p>

		<p>Americans are so jealous of Barack Obama, The One who God Almighty ordained to lead America on the path of rightisness.  I am proud he is my president and all of you should be greatfull he was sent to us.  I can&rsquo;t wait for the day he grows. He will silence his Critics by growing into a giant, bursting through the roof of the Capitol. He&rsquo;ll punch His fists down on the Republicans and nay Sayers in Congress and squash them under his magnificent fists as he grows to be as big as the Washington monument. All Will bow to Him and he will step on anyone who opposes his Divinity.</p>

		<p>The cult-like praising for obama, is exactly what&rsquo;s expected from a third world country. Raising a politician up beyond god ensures communism. Don&rsquo;t we acknowledge useless individuals enough, simply because they are not white?! It&rsquo;s understood blacks continually force recognition upon themselves, as they have done nothing to be legitimately recognized.</p>

		<p>Another reason to get rid of Hawaii as soon as possible. Hawaii was used as an example by the late Julian Simon-currently resting in a cryogenic deep freeze,head severed from body(I&rsquo;m not making this up folks)-of how racially diverse Hawaii  proves that maximizing racial diversity really works. Tell that to the White kids who attend high school in Hawaii where they are beat up on a regular basis for being White Tell that to the Native Hawaiians who would like to rid Hawaii of the predatory Japanese. Get rid of Hawaii!!!!</p>

		<p>I am not sure which is sicker, that so many wierdos want to rename half the country after Presdient Barry or the fact that barry doesn&rsquo;t say &#8220;cut it out already&#8221;.  He hasn&rsquo;t the least amount of modesty or shame.</p>

		<p>On the subject of Barry/Barack, which I find distasteful at best, hasn&rsquo;t everyone noted the towering ego of this pretender. He has yet to admit to poor judgement of any kind and continues to blame Bush for the country&rsquo;s increasing problems. In an interview with the fawning and overrated Oprah he gives himself  B plus on job performance. Any man so self centered is incapable of sound judgement. </p>

		<p>The Independence movement in Hawaii is really gaining steam, as I&rsquo;ve been reading. I couldn&rsquo;t care less personally, I would drop them as a state in a New York minute. Billions saved for taxpayers, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. The place is nothing but a welfare state anyway, with a bunch of crybaby Hawaiian nationals. </p>

<p>How are they going to accurately establish a birthplace park for this empty suit when no one seems to know exactly where he came into the world?  It&rsquo;s tempting to laugh at the &#8220;Overgrown scrublnad&#8221; mention but an outrage nonetheless.</p>

		<p>The good thing about naming a national park after BHO would be visitor traffic would drop markedly. Good for the park itself, of course. Blacks have a habit of actively not visiting those endless, boring Black History museums that have been created. Seems the only thing keeping those selfsame museums financially afloat being those incessant shake-downs of White owned business establishments for donations and funding.</p>
<p>Come to think of it&hellip; Nevada could open a &#8220;special interests&#8221; Museum honoring William T. Clinton. Decor could consist mainly of blue dresses hanging on the walls&hellip; dresses that have been conspicuously &#8220;stained&#8221;, you might say. With ladies of questionable repute inviting gentlemen visitors into small, sparsely furnished rooms.</p>
<p>The idea of honoring presidents does open a phletora of possibilities on reflection.</p>

		<p>#1 Shameless liberal, that was the funniest thing I read in a long time. I especially liked the part about Obamas&rsquo;divinity. Tell me, does Michelle share it to? Also, could you write another opinion about him? I&rsquo;ve been kind of down lately and need all the laughs I can get. Your&rsquo;e better for shear idiocy than the Three Stooges, Abbot and Costello, Laurel and Hardy, put together.</p>
