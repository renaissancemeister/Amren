<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34756700/ns/us_news-race_and_ethnicity/">Atlanta Secession Bid Raises Race Issues</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, January 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the cradle of the civil rights movement, a new secession effort is under way that would break off Atlanta&rsquo;s predominantly white, wealthy suburbs to the north from poorer, black neighborhoods in the south.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a renewed push to take some suburbs out of Fulton County, Georgia&rsquo;s most populous and home to most of the city of Atlanta, and put them under the now-extinct Milton County.</p>
<p>Its supporters hope resurrecting the county would give residents there more responsive government. But opponents say the measure is racially motivated and will open up a deep rift between black and white, rich and poor in a state with a complicated racial history. The area that would be split off is more than 75 percent white, while a large block of the remaining portion of Fulton County is 90 percent minority.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The idea isn&rsquo;t new. But these days, there&rsquo;s some muscle behind the movement now that its sponsor is about to become House Speaker pro tem, the second-most powerful position in the Georgia House of Representatives. The measure made it out of House committee this year. It&rsquo;s been stymied so far by questions about the counties&rsquo; financial viability and the tangle of laws that would have to be changed.</p>
<p>The region that became Milton County was originally part of the Cherokee Indian Nation until the state of Georgia grabbed the land in the 1830s. The Cherokees were expelled to what is now Oklahoma and cotton plantations flourished there, helped along by cheap slave labor before the Civil War.</p>
<p>But a boll weevil infestation of cotton in the early part of the 20th century decimated the county&rsquo;s economy. After limping along financially, Milton County was folded into Fulton County in 1932 during the Great Depression.</p>
<p><b>Race a factor?</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The issue is what the hell are they doing with our money,&#8221; Joe Stewardson said as he sipped coffee at a shop in Atlanta&rsquo;s Old Fourth Ward neighborhood, home to Martin Luther King&rsquo;s birthplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is race part of the equation? Probably. But I think money transcends all other considerations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The legislation&rsquo;s sponsor, state Rep. Jan Jones, an Alpharetta Republican, denies race is behind the proposal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Her bill would amend the Georgia Constitution to allow the return of Milton County. It would need a two-thirds vote in each chamber of the state Legislature and must then be approved by voters because state law limits the number of counties to 159.</p>
<p>If the Legislature approves the measure, it would be on the ballot in November, but the split wouldn&rsquo;t take place until 2013.</p>
<p>Newly elected Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed opposes the measure, worried it will hurt the city&rsquo;s bottom line.</p>
<p><b>Changing faces</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What used to be Milton County is now largely white and Republican and affluent. Atlanta and its southern suburbs are mostly black, are controlled by Democrats and have neighborhoods with some of the highest poverty rates in America. Buckhead, a trendy Atlanta neighborhood known for its clubs, restaurants and mansions, would remain in Fulton County.</p>
<p>The entire Milton County area is now incorporated in one city or another which means those cities could provide some services like police and fire, cutting down on the county costs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Splitting off the county&rsquo;s wealthiest cities could be a devastating blow to Atlanta, which is grappling with a steep budget shortfall and skyrocketing pension obligations. State Rep. Tyrone Brooks, an Atlanta Democrat and civil rights activist, called it a &#8220;sucker punch&#8221; for the city, which is the engine for the state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>If the State Constitution limits the number of counties, then the obvious answer is to take that part of Fulton and make it part of a county to the north, either Cobb or Gwinnett (IIRC).  Counties are state-recognized divisions of states, so the state legislature needs to be the only actor here.</p>

		<p>In Cleveland the opposite is going on. There is a never ending stream of propaganda that Cleveland and Cuyahoga County must &#8220;regionalize&#8221; in order to obtain governmental efficiency. The main purveyor of this is the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the only newspaper left in Cleveland. Anyone who objects and points out that the white suburbs are doing just fine is either ignored or shouted down (and naturally called a racist).<br>
The combination of the black destruction of Cleveland which was fully implemented by forced school integration via busing and Section 8 housing has now created all black suburbs. These cities are now called &#8220;inner ring suburbs&#8221;, and they are now lumped in with Cleveland as communities that need to be saved by regionalizing. There are numerous once prosperous white cities which are now all black and experiencing the effects of blackness; high crime, poor schools, street after street of foreclosures. East Cleveland, Maple Heights, Euclid, Bedford are examples. While once restricted to the east side, now west side cities are under pressure. Lakewood and Parma are now finding out about the joys of diversity.<br>
  I just hope there are enough whites left with a sense of racial<br>
identity to stop this insanity.</p>

<p>Of course it&rsquo;s racially motivated, Whites are tired of paying all the bills for blacks. And like there isn&rsquo;t already a &#8220;deep rift&#8221; between black and White. Why would blacks be opposed to this. Blacks are always complaining that they want to be in charge of their own destiny, that &#8220;da man be holden dem down&#8221; and that the blue eyed &#8220;debel&#8221; is the cause of ALL their problems. This sounds like a win-win to me. The blacks would be free, free at &#8220;lass&#8221; of the &#8220;racisss&#8221; White folks and finally be able to have the city of their dreams like their brothas in Detroit, and Whites would be free of the non-productive people currently sucking up their tax dollars.<br>
Post #1 - very good suggestion.  That would be a much easier way to go about it and probably have a better chance of it going through.<br>

		<p>Splitting the counties is not a long-term solution.  The only long-term solution is to give whites self-determination and freedom of association.  Whites must be allowed to choose who their neighbors are, who their money is supporting, with whom their children go to school and they must be allowed to forcibly preserve the ethnic composition of their neighborhoods.  Without these basic freedoms, there is nothing to stop blacks and mestizos from following whites wherever they go.</p>

		<p>Those white liberals in Atlanta have to be just a tad nervous.  If the northern part of Fulton takes a stroll, Buckhead will have to take up the slack.  So how&rsquo;s your &#8220;rainbow coalition&#8221; working out now, white folks?  The last vestige of conservative whites left that place a long time ago.  The whites who are left are getting precisely what they deserve.</p>

<p>Uggggh!  I&rsquo;m sick of white people saying &#8220;this isn&rsquo;t about race.&#8221;  Yes, it is!  Quit lying to others and, most importantly, to yourselves.  I think most blacks will respect that &#8220;un-PC&#8221; honesty much more than the modern white who spews out this mindless drivel of &#8220;I&rsquo;m not racist, I (fill in the blank.)&#8221;  If whites could confidently and unashamedly say, &#8220;Yes, we are racist.  No, we&rsquo;re not ashamed of it.  We prefer our own kind and our own culture and our own government&#8221;, then the Civil Rights industry would go belly up in no time.</p>

I agree that this is the only long term solution.  Right now, the way this is accomplished is through artificially high prices on housing.  This de facto excludes the dysfunctional minority groups.  But of course it&rsquo;s unfair to make people need to pay extra money just to live in neighborhoods where their children are safe and their home won&rsquo;t be broken into.  That essentially amounts to a &#8220;functional tax.&#8221;  But, right now, paying this unfair cost is better than living in a &#8220;vibrant neighborhood,&#8221; as we all know!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to open a rift between black and white. That rift was opened at the time of Creation. As related to Georgia in the current time, that rift can barely be widened - it&rsquo;s a gaping chasm already; only playing &#8216;nice-nice&rsquo; on the surface.</p>
<p>Whites are tired of paying all the taxes in Fulton County, supporting the predominantly welfare (and co-incidentally, crime infested - what are the chances??) &#8216;minority&rsquo; half of the county, which is South Fulton. Even now there is enough big white money in Fulton (north Fulton, specifically) that they insist on the crime reported on the news from Fulton County being clarified as coming from &#8216;South Fulton&rsquo; as opposed to just Fulton in general.</p>

		<p>I live in DeKalb Co., which is next to Fulton and where the remaining part of ATL lies. I got fed up w/Brooks ages ago. He&rsquo;s a defensive racist. As for Jones, whom does she think she&rsquo;s kidding? Race is indeed a factor. A large black population= a high crime rate. Reed needs to get a grip. </p>

		<p>The story has been played out before. White suburbs are to pay into the system, but not to have a voice in how the money is spent. As a taxpayer, you have only to show up to a public hearing to get a sense of how White South Africans are treated by their government.</p>
<p>The inner city can&rsquo;t be governed, especially when it is in black hands.There is no benefit to me as a taxpayer in maintaining services for city dwellers. My only concern would be with &#8220;black flight&#8221; from the little Sowetos that their people created to my town.</p>

10  &mdash;  Mike, White racial realists are simply either too lazy or not caring enough to band together </p>
<p>If you are going to make these statements you should be leading by example. The average White is busy making mortgage payments (good point 8  &mdash;  Phaedon) and working long hours. They are not prepared to be the first to hoist with their own petard. </p>
<p>#7 won&rsquo;t even sign with his own name and is giving marching orders. </p>
<p>&#8220;Lead by example&#8221;</p>
<p>When Whites begin seeing others speaking their minds and not getting fired or ostracized then the dam will be broken. The first will be individuals that are not dependent on others for their financial and community well-being. The old scenario of a meeting when the first hand hesitatingly goes up and then everyone begins to raise their hands.</p>
<p>Part of that first hand going up is for others to post examples of how they stood up and successfuly weathered the storm.</p>

		<p>Whites, when they want to advocate for something for their own benefit, need to make their argument and stick to it.  No apologies.  And no negatives, such as &#8220;we are NOT racists&#8221;.  Once you respond in the negative to your detractors you let them frame the debate.  Whites need to stick to whatever their primary argument is.</p>
<p>Citizen: We want to secede because we feel as an independent county we could use the tax payers money more efficiently.<br>
Detractor: You really want to secede because Atlanta is mostly black.<br>
Citizen.  Like I said we want to secede because we feel we can be more efficient on our own and reduce taxes for our residents.</p>
<p>And so on.  Don&rsquo;t let the enemy frame the debate!<br>
