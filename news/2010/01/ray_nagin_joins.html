			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frank Donze and Michelle Krupa, Times-Picayune, January 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mayor Ray Nagin weighed in Thursday on the first big controversy in the campaign to choose his successor, lending his full support to mayoral candidate Troy Henry&rsquo;s contention that the news media are focusing too much on polls that suggest New Orleans could elect its first white mayor in three decades.</p>
<p>At a Wednesday news conference, Henry said while he doesn&rsquo;t object to news stories about polls  &mdash;  the most recent of which show Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu and businessman John Georges, both of whom are white, in the top two spots  &mdash;  he said some reports are beginning &#8220;to create an undertone with the voting population that marginalizes African-American candidates in this race.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These recent stories, and the predetermined tone they create, undermine the democratic process of campaigning,&#8221; Henry said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;All of the so-called media experts, all they&rsquo;ve been talking about is there&rsquo;s going to be a runoff between two white candidates,&#8221; Nagin said. &#8220;And that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re feeding to the public  &mdash;  every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>After state Sen. Ed Murray, the campaign&rsquo;s best-known black candidate, dropped out of the race Sunday, citing a desire to avoid a racially divisive contest, the campaign&rsquo;s top tier shrunk to six. The group includes three African-American candidates: Henry, former Civil District Judge Nadine Ramsey and fair-housing advocate James Perry.</p>
<p>In a poll before Murray&rsquo;s exit, all three trailed Murray, who ranked third with 11.3 percent. Henry suggested the notion that the race is a foregone conclusion could suppress voter turnout.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s undermining the process, and it&rsquo;s not fair to the African-American candidates,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All we&rsquo;re asking for is fairness and equal consideration, period. I think it&rsquo;s disingenuous and what we don&rsquo;t want is African-American voters thinking that this is a predetermined race. Just treat us equal. That&rsquo;s all we want.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we don&rsquo;t want to do is begin to put in the minds of all voters that this is a fait accompli, that this is not a real race, that this is an anointment. That&rsquo;s not fair to any of the candidates. And the fact that some of the reports have categorized this in terms of race, it&rsquo;s disingenuous to all of the African-American candidates. It&rsquo;s not fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Henry said he did not mean to suggest that New Orleans, where registered black voters outnumber white ones by a 2-1 margin, must be led by an African-American mayor. &#8220;It&rsquo;s important that we have the best mayor,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Henry also indicated Wednesday that Ramsey and Perry &#8220;concur with my frustration that some media reports want to diminish the election to race.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his remarks Wednesday, Henry warned members of the media that they don&rsquo;t always understand how their reports are received.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s not an African-American among you in the press today. How you interpret what you say and how African-American candidates like myself interpret what you say is different,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Part of the challenge we have today in New Orleans is that sometimes, we don&rsquo;t communicate effectively. And what you think you&rsquo;re saying  &mdash;  and I&rsquo;m not accusing anyone of being mean-spirited  &mdash;  but unintentionally there are consequences sometimes to what is being said and how they&rsquo;re being said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nagin, meanwhile, offered a vague conspiracy theory for Murray&rsquo;s withdrawal from the mayoral contest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t get it,&#8221; Nagin said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t understand the recent developments that have happened. How someone can be running for mayor for a whole year, have every political organization behind them, and then a month before the election is getting ready to take off, all of a sudden say because of racial issues and because I can&rsquo;t raise money, I&rsquo;m out.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always wondered why Mitch Landrieu wants to be Mayor of New Orleans.  After all, he&rsquo;s either one heartbeat or one very bad turn on the part of Piyush Jindal away from being Governor.</p>
<p>Then again, why would any sane white person want to be Mayor of New Orleans?</p>

<p>Perhaps to restore it to being one of the great cities of the Great South.  Ditto with Atlanta.</p>

		<p> Wow I like to think the black guy stepped out of the race to give the white guys a chance to fix the city. I&rsquo;d love an equal opportunity society with voters deciding on canidates based on their platforms and I think the white guys probably have a better plan than the black guy and he relised it. The fact is that there is probably a scandal that one of his opponets dug up causing him to drop out of the race. Ray Nagin can always come up with a race baiting theory though can&rsquo;t he.</p>

<p>Oh, you mean like when &#8220;mayor&#8221; Nagin urged residents to &#8220;rebuild a chocolate N.O.&#8221; and &#8216;you can&rsquo;t have N.O. no other way.&#8221; </p>

As I said during the Atlanta mayoral race, &#8216;once you go black, you&rsquo;re not allowed to go back&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a one-way street. Blacks believe once they achieve their end, it&rsquo;s the end.</p>

		<p>During the last Atlanta mayoral election cycle the very idea that a white person would be mayor sent the old line black machine into frantic damage control.  They pulled every game they could think of including suggesting it would lead again to firehoses being used on black people.  There are no depths low enough for blacks to to go when trying to prevent what they see as a reversal of fortune for their race.  People in Atlanta are convinced the runoff election was rigged.  The newest black mayor is already making the same kinds of promises and creating resources from thin air.  I wonder whose family will end up with most of the airport concessions this time around? <br>

<p>Why does ANY political candidate spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to get elected to a job that pays little if anything&hellip;the graft, corruption, thievery, sex, any number of reasons, though I doubt altruistic ideas are one of them.</p>

		<p>Why would any white man want to be president of Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, or any place on earth inhabited by a majority of black Africans?  In fact, why would any white person want to be in such a place at all?</p>
<p>Blacks have amply demonstrated they&rsquo;re incapable of functioning above the basest tribal level anywhere on earth, that they inevitably reduce anyplace they inhabit to total destruction and ruin once they become a majority.</p>

		<p>It is interesting that a black electorate that will otherwise vote how they are told by their pastors and community organizers will help return Whites to office. I don&rsquo;t think that they can admit that after several black mayors in a row that the city is in a tailspin, but it seems that they vote as if they believed this to be the case.</p>

		<p>Mitch Landrieu must be a relative of Mary Landrieu.  My best guess is that Mary Landrieu wants her relative as mayor of New Orleans so that he can &#8220;deliver&#8221; New Orleans to her when she runs for senator again.  Murray was probably offered a good paying job somewhere as a payoff for getting out of the race.</p>

		<p>Neither Mitch Landrieu nor John Georges will &#8220;fix&#8221; anything.  These guys are white liberals (tho&rsquo; Georges masquerades as a moderate).  The better choice would have been (black State Senator) Ed Murray.  He could not do the damage Landrieu will do.</p>

		<p>More black hypocrisy!  They call us racists if we won&rsquo;t elect one of their own to rule over us and destroy the society we built, but God forbid they allow a &#8216;racist white man&rsquo; in who could make their lives better than Maybe Nagin.</p>
