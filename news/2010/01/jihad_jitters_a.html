	<p>Is the Met afraid of Mohammed?</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art quietly pulled images of the Prophet Mohammed from its Islamic collection and may not include them in a renovated exhibition area slated to open in 2011, The Post has learned.</p>
<p>The museum said the controversial images  &mdash;  objected to by conservative Muslims who say their religion forbids images of their holy founder  &mdash;  were &#8220;under review.&#8221;</p>
<p>Critics say the Met has a history of dodging criticism and likely wants to escape the kind of outcry that Danish cartoons of Mohammed caused in 2006.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Met currently has about 60 items from its 60,000-piece Islamic collection on temporary display in a corner of its vast second-floor Great Hall while larger galleries are renovated. But its three ancient renderings of Mohammed are not among them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Three years ago, the Met changed its &#8220;Primitive Art Galleries&#8221; to the &#8220;Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas&#8221; for the sake of political correctness, said author Michael Gross, author of &#8220;Rogues&rsquo; Gallery,&#8221; a book about the Met.</p>
<p>Just recently, it decided its highly anticipated &#8220;Islamic Galleries&#8221; will be given an awkward new name ahead of the 2011 opening. Visitors will stroll around rooms dedicated to art from &#8220;Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia and Later South Asia,&#8221; according to a museum press release.</p>

		<p>Well, the Met has a WHOLE lot more than just this stupid collection of Islamic art - they have to protect the REALLY valuable artworks, like their second-to-none Impressionist collection, etc. etc. etc.  To have some uneducated hairy dirty schmatas-kopf blow himself up in the Met would take out some of the finest, rarest, and most valuable art in the USA.  It&rsquo;s awful that they have to think in these terms, but it&rsquo;s just one more benefit of multiculturalism, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be &#8220;performance art&#8221; and as such be supported by the National Endowment for the Arts?  I&rsquo;m sure that there is a grant program for that, somewhere in the current Health Care Bill.</p>

In 1999, the Brooklyn Museum showed a picture of the Virgin Mary spattered with cow dung.   Mayor Guiliani tried to stop halt funding of the museum but was stopped by the court.   Christians who were deeply offended were told to <a><br/>
get over it</a>, it&rsquo;s free speech to insult Christian symbols.   </p>
<p>What we see here is the success of the threat of violence whenever someone is the slightest bit &#8220;offensive&#8221; to Islamic fanatics.  </p>
<p>When will someone make a free speech argument to Islamic fundamentalists?  Or will we continue our abilities to express ourselves in ways that don&rsquo;t agree with Sharia?</p>

		<p>I have noticed that  the avant-guard liberal whistlebritches crowd delights in offending conservative Christians and even tells us it is good for us.They pontificate about how brave and couragouss they are (especially when defending multiculture gibberish).<br/>
But&hellip;.<br/>
When it comes to Muslims&hellip;.they do not want to ofend and get a certain amount of common decency about themselves.</p>
<p>They are like loudmouths of all stripes&hellip;.cowards. </p>

		<p>How very sad that another entity must bow down to Islam. My question is why the Met is even carrying an exhibit of this barbaric religion/political/lifestyle of Muslims? These people want nothing more than to rid the world of all those who do not believe as they do. When do we begin to fight back? No more mosques (they allow no Christian churches in their countries), no footbaths, no 5-times a day call to prayer nor any of their practices. In short, why do we even let them into this country? We&rsquo;re already overrun with Latino border jumpers and visa overstays, why are we now subjected to this 6th century abomination?</p>

		<p> Islam&rsquo;s attitude toward representational art does not bode well for the future of the rich cultural/artistic heritage of Europe. I can foresee another artistic dark age in the making with the demographic transition from Christian Europe to Eurabia. Italy seems to be the only country resisting the trend. I wish them well. </p>

		<p>&#8220;the controversial images &mdash; objected to by conservative Muslims who say their religion forbids images of their holy founder&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, when the Mohammad cartoons first came out, it was said that Islam does have a long tradition of portraying the human form and also has depictions of Mohammad himself. Especially within the Turkish cultural domain.</p>
<p>Objections are primarily from the Wahabbi sect of Islam, the form practiced in Saudi.</p>
<p>The Medinah Country Club in the Chicago area in the time after 9/11 had inscriptions of the word Allah on the grounds. Were quickly covered up so as not &#8220;offend&#8221;!!</p>

		<p> One thing you have to admit about the muslims they will not tolerate their religious founder being portrayed in a disrespectful fashion. Christians on the other hand will let any anti-christ artist portray Jesus and the Virgin Mary in any despicable manner they like. Why aren&rsquo;t we as active protecting our icons?</p>
