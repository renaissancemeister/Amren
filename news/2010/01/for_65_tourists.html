<h1>For $65, Tourists Get Peek at Los Angeles Gangland</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Watkins, Forbes, January 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Only miles from the scenic vistas and celebrity mansions that draw sightseers from around the globe  &mdash;  but a world away from the glitz and glamour  &mdash;  a bus tour is rolling through the dark side of the city&rsquo;s gang turf.</p>
<p>Passengers paying $65 a head Saturday signed waivers acknowledging they could be crime victims and put their fate in the hands of tattooed ex-gang members who say they have negotiated a cease-fire among rivals in the most violent gangland in America.</p>
<p>If that sounds daunting, consider the challenge facing organizers of LA Gang Tours: trying to build a thriving venture that provides a glimpse into gang life while also trying to convince people that gang-plagued communities are not as hopeless as movies depict.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 50 people brushed aside safety concerns for Saturday&rsquo;s maiden tour to hear how notorious gangs got started and bear witness to the struggling neighborhoods where tens of thousands of residents have been lured into gang life.</p>
<p>The unmarked chartered coach wound its way through downtown. The first sight was a stretch of concrete riverbed featured in such movies as &#8220;Terminator&#8221; and &#8220;Grease,&#8221; where countless splotches of gray paint conceal graffiti that is often the mark of street gangs and tagging crews.</p>
<p>After that, it was on to the Central Jail, home to many a thug, past Skid Row&rsquo;s squalor and homeless masses and into South Los Angeles, breeding ground for some of the city&rsquo;s deadliest gangs.</p>
<p>Motoring through an industrial area, the bus enters the Florence-Firestone neighborhood, close to the birthplace of the Crips and current home to Florencia 13, a Latino gang that was accused by federal prosecutors of racist attacks against black residents.</p>
<p>Gray warehouses soon merge with single-story stucco homes as the bus heads south. Few gangsters risk hanging out on street corners, as local rules mean they could get arrested even for congregating, but graffiti on walls, road signs and convenience storefronts betray the presence of Florencia 13 and other gangs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lomas, 45, [Alfred Lomas, a former member of the Florencia 13, founder of LA Gang Tours] a respected activist who has worked with the faith-based Los Angeles Dream Center to distribute hundreds of tons of food to low-income families across the inner city, left gang life about five years ago.</p>
<p>He stresses the aim of his nonprofit company is to bring jobs to communities along the route and to reinvest money through micro-loans and scholarships, though he&rsquo;s not sure how the tour will accomplish that. He also eventually wants to start a gallery and gang museum.</p>
<p>He said the tour will create 10 part-time jobs, mainly for ex-gang members working as guides and talking about their own struggles and efforts to reduce violence. The tour is initially scheduled to run once a month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Out of sensitivity to residents, passengers are banned from shooting photographs or video from the bus. The only place that is allowed is near the end of the trip, when they can step off the bus and film an outdoor area where graffiti is allowed.</p>
<p>Stretches of the tour have almost nothing to do with gangs, but instead exploit famous chapters of violence in the city&rsquo;s history, such as a deadly 1974 shootout between police and the Symbionese Liberation Army and the site of the riots that followed the acquittal of officers in the Rodney King beating.</p>

		<p>I would like to know who arrived at the $65 price point and the accounting behind it.  Perhaps the price is financially sound, but knowing the subject matter, I would have used a more gangland appropriate price, like $187.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s worth a trip to the company website just to read the waiver that all ghetto-tourists must sign. I&rsquo;m not sure I fully understood all the legalese, but it appears to include a clause that says even if the companies own employees victimize patrons, the company won&rsquo;t take any responsibility. </p>

		<p>If I gave the &#8220;guides&#8221; another $50 bucks, would he arrange for the bus to be pounced on by the gangs to rob and assault the White liberals on board? Ya know, &#8220;keepin it reeeal&#8221;. And PLEASE post it on youtube! It would be something uplifting to watch after a bad day.   </p>

		<p>Well, dang, why didn&rsquo;t I think of that???  I was raised in L.A. and I know it as well as anyone.  All I&rsquo;d have to do is get a couple of my AA buddies, rent a bus, undersell the competition at $50 a head, and we&rsquo;d give &#8216;em a tour they&rsquo;d never forget.  My God, people would pay to see ANYTHING these days; if you have a Hummer you can drive around those areas for free, if you go in really good blackface.  Anybody up for a tour of the Mexican cockfights in Pomona and Ontario, CA?</p>

		<p>I know there will be plenty of criticism on this board about this project, but I think that it is a good thing that Mr. Lomas is starting a legitimate business and trying to improve his community. However, his effort seems extremely dangerous and short-sighted. Exactly how long does he think he can bring gawking tourists into those areas without having a violent incident and Mr. Lomas is sued into bankrupcy? Any lawyer will tell you that a wavier of liability isn&rsquo;t worth the paper it&rsquo;s printed on.  </p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t see what WN have a problem with this.</p>
<p>A big part of the problem is whites don&rsquo;t regularly get to see non-whites in action unless they are being a victim of them.</p>
<p>With this, you make a few bucks off a libtards&rsquo; desire to experience a holy epiphiny of diversity.  By the end of the tour he&rsquo;s seen dramatic proof that the people he idealized, are in fact, evil, and they really, really hate him.  They start to get a vague idea that they are coming to his neighborhood to live real soon.</p>
<p>Not an awakened but surely a disturbing beginning of a racial consciousness rolling over as it sleeps&hellip;.maybe soon to wake up.</p>
<p>These tours should be sponsored by White Nationalists so as not to miss anything.  The feces in the street.  The white whores being slapped around by non-white pimps.  Mixed children being abused everywhere.  Ghetto Lobster and other dead bodies left unattended by people who simply don&rsquo;t care.</p>

		<p>In response to Anonymous #8. </p>
<p>Mr. Lomas may have hit upon a brilliant idea. Even if the waivers of liability aren&rsquo;t worth the paper they are printed on, look at his clientele. The kind of person who pays $65 for a tour of the hood is most likely the kind of person who wouldn&rsquo;t sue a group of gang members for fear of being labeled racist. They would however, sue a white tour operator if the fat cow sitting next to them spills his/her coffee. Also, could you realistically collect a dime if the &#8220;Latin studs&#8221; took over the bus and gave everyone a beat down? </p>
<p>Do retired police get the tour for $50?</p>

		<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;ve negotiated a cease fire in others cities like Vegas and Memphis too,  only for the purpose of facilitating the practice of their nefarious activities.  They&rsquo;re even working cooperatively. Do these naive tourists think that all the Homies, Eses and other assorted gangstas and pandilleros are actively engaged in studying for their GEDs, SAT and enrolling at UCLA?</p>
<p>The cease fire is only among themselves and certainly doesn&rsquo;t include LAPD. They&rsquo;re at greater risk than before.&#8221;</p>

		<p>How soon before there is a gang reality show - calling FOX network.  I&rsquo;ve thought for awhile that I could buy some of those South African mine resistant vehicles and give tours of Detroit.  I could even work with some of the residents of the visited areas so they could help me make it more realistic, I would even supply the 9mm ammo.</p>

		<p>Almost 20 years ago, my dad gave me advice for driving in Detroit:  If you&rsquo;re in a slum area and children are out playing, do not stop at the stop signs (just make sure there&rsquo;s no cross traffic).  Otherwise you stand a good chance of being carjacked.</p>

		<p>In the 1950s, as a teenager, after midnight, we would pile into a 1950 Nash, take a couple of pistols with us, and ride through the &#8220;Hill District&#8221; in Pittsburgh, PA.</p>
<p>The Africans were always a source of entertainment. Bodies laying around on the sidewalk and streets, people chasing each other with knives, all kinds of nuttiness.</p>
<p>We never had to defend ourselves with the guns, but we always kept moving and kept the windows wound up, and the doors locked.</p>

		<p>18   &mdash;    187 is often used in rap and hip hop as a code word for murder in general, and murder of a law enforcement officer in particular.  It comes from Section 187 of California&rsquo;s criminal code, the section that defines murder as a crime.  Though Section 187 doesn&rsquo;t explicitly mention LEOs, it has taken on the meaning in that particular genre of &#8220;music.&#8221;</p>

		<p>For several years now, foreign tourists have been able to take the &#8220;ruins of Detroit&#8221; bus ride, allowing them to see the inevitable result of black rule firsthand. This sounds like the next step in such &#8220;reality tourism.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I bet you that I wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to show my CCW permit in the open, or even bring one of my pistols with me to begin with. These &#8220;reformed&#8221; gangbangers don&rsquo;t like anyone who resists and fights back. It&rsquo;s bad for business and if you get a fighting Whitey, could be bad for their health. Kevlar vest would be a good idea, though. Do Iraqi and Afghanistan war vets get a free trip? Actually a lot of them probably joined to get out of those areas, only to see it in the Middle East. </p>
