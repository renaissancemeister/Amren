<h1><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D9DGBUH02&amp;show_article=1">Racial Threat Puts Ohio College on Alert, on Edge</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Meghan Barr, Breitbart, January 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An attacker could find many places to hide at Hocking College, a campus carved into a forest in the Appalachian foothills. And with the threat of a mass killing looming over black students at the community college, Allen Edwards is steering clear of the trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t feel too safe walking by the woods,&#8221; said Edwards, a 19-year-old black student from Canton. &#8220;There&rsquo;s woods everywhere. And somebody could be out in them, and I don&rsquo;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>The FBI is investigating a threat scrawled last week on a bathroom wall warning that black students would be killed Feb. 2. It bore the trademarks of just another casual  &mdash;  though chilling  &mdash;  threat of violence on a college campus, but students here aren&rsquo;t taking any chances.</p>
<p>At least two black students have withdrawn permanently from school out of fear for their safety, and another dozen have moved out of the dorm where the threat was found, officials at the two-year technical college said. {snip}</p>
<p>The school confirmed Tuesday that the threat said black students would be killed Feb. 2. At least one subsequent note reading &#8220;kill the n  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  &#8221; was reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The college has provided temporary housing for students who are too scared to stay in Hocking Heights, the dorm where the threats were found. And for those wary of venturing outside until after Feb. 2, teachers are making allowances for missed classwork.</p>
<p>Since the first threat was discovered Friday, the school has installed more security cameras in dorms and beefed up foot patrols. A $5,000 reward is being offered, and extra counselors are on hand.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Edwards said he has seen racist comments written on the same bathroom wall in the past but didn&rsquo;t let it bother him. But two days after the first threat was found, he saw the second on the bathroom wall and reported it to campus police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another resident of the second floor, Amelinda Marengo, sat on her bed and said that even though the threat doesn&rsquo;t include her, she is still afraid.</p>
<p>Marengo, who is half Puerto Rican, said she and her black roommate endured racist taunts in the cafeteria on several occasions last year. Her roommate declined to be interviewed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;d be sitting at a lunch table and some guys would be sitting across the room, and they&rsquo;d be screaming, like, &#8216;n  &mdash;    &mdash;  - lover&rsquo; across the table,&#8221; Marengo said. &#8220;I had enough of it one day and I got up and I just started yelling at them and telling them, like, &#8216;There is no reason for you to treat someone like that.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>About a year ago, Marengo said, a male friend led her into the second-floor men&rsquo;s bathroom and showed her racist comments on the wall, including a drawing of what she called a &#8220;hangman.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the threat at Hocking, with its racially tense environment, is sending ripples through the area. Students and faculty members at Ohio University in nearby Athens are also on alert. Short of stationing police officers in the woods  &mdash;  which Hocking lacks the manpower to do  &mdash;  officials there say vigilance remains the best defense.</p>
<p>Students rushed to classes Tuesday as an icy wind blew snow flurries through the trees. Disturbing rumors floated, including a claim  &mdash;  later determined to be false  &mdash;  that nooses had been found in the woods. {snip}</p>

		<p>The second I saw this on Drudge Report, I immediately smelled a hoax. If it is indeed the real deal committed by whites, then we need to throw them to the wolves. They&rsquo;re not helping our cause at all by adding fuel to the fire of Multiculturalism.</p>
<p>The best thing to do is behave and let the hoaxers make themselves look like fools. Eventually, more people will realize &#8220;who&#8221; are the real haters.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t feel safe walking by the woods. There&rsquo;s woods everywhere and someone could be out in them and I don&rsquo;t know&#8221;.</p>
<p>Gotta love it&hellip;</p>
<p>Even as a young boy I picked up real quick how apprehensive blacks (especially northern blacks), were of rural areas and open spaces. If it&rsquo;s not a bear behind every tree or rock then it&rsquo;s some white dude, well hidden and ready to stike.</p>
<p><br>
One thing is certain, blacks identify rural America with white &#8220;armed&#8221; America which adds greatly to their anxiety. Whether this &#8220;fear of the forest&#8221; is real, perceived or overblown doesn&rsquo;t matter. What does matter is &#8220;they&#8221; believe it. </p>
<p>It works for me&hellip;</p>

		<p> Interesting, isn&rsquo;t it, that they saved the one quote from a White student for the very last? And then they dealt with it in such a way as to make him seem supposedly callous and unconcerned about alleged threats to kill his black fellow students.</p>
<p> You know what my guess is? Some black student   &mdash;   possibly several of them   &mdash;   nursing a grievance against the school administration, the White students, or whoever, has left the &#8220;racist&#8221; notes on the walls of the restrooms, hoping just such a brouhaha would erupt due to an over-reaction by the powers-that-be. Stay tuned, folks; I&rsquo;ll bet the culprit, if found, will turn out to be black   &mdash;   and then the matter will be quickly swept under the rug by the news media. </p>

		<p>Bernie&rsquo;s Law #1 of Hate Crime Hoaxes:</p>
<p>&#8220;Absent video evidence of a white attacking or threatening a black, every time a black accuses a white of a hate crime it is a hoax.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bernie&rsquo;s Law #2 of Hate Crime Hoaxes:</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter how many of these incidents are exposed as hoaxes the media will never questions whether a black accusing a white of a hate crime is telling the truth.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I smell hoax also.  Right here in Claremont, CA, at the presigious Claremont Colleges a few years ago, a well-known black female was invited to speak to the students.  She duly arrived, but on the night of her speech, she announced that her car had been defaced with the &#8220;N&#8221;-word, egged, and spray painted with racist slurs.  Well, the car was covered with this stuff, that&rsquo;s for sure, but it turned out that the black woman speaker had done all of it herself, hoping to start a racial turmoil at the Claremont Colleges and University.  Didn&rsquo;t work.  She was prosecuted and sentenced.</p>

		<p>Quick. We need the Rev. Al to get things &#8220;ahoaxin&#8216;&#8220;He&rsquo;ll know how to pull in his media &rsquo; bitches&rsquo; and get accusations flying everywhere. Yessir Sharpton&rsquo;s the man. Nothing ever sticks to him. That&rsquo;s courtesy of the phony media,for sure.

		<p>Well, shut my mouth. You really think those kids dropped out of school because someone wrote on a bathroom wall? I guess that&rsquo;s why blacks always attack whites at night, so no one can see them. Whites of course, would certainly attack in the daylight so no one could see them. Why are these people in college?</p>

		<p>It must be time for Mid-Terms again. Forget about studying and acting like a civilized student, just start a racial hoax and passing grades will be handed out. The majority of these black students don&rsquo;t go to college for knowledge; they go for the hook ups and partying on someone else&rsquo;s (American taxpayer) dime.</p>
