			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Vecsey and David K. Li, New York Post, Jan. 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>NBA all-star Gilbert Arenas and his Washington Wizards teammate Javaris Crittenton drew guns on each other in the team&rsquo;s locker room during a Christmas Eve dispute over a gambling debt, The Post has learned. </p>
<p>League sources say the pistol-packing point guards had heaters at the ready inside the Verizon Center, the Washington, DC, home of the Wizards  &mdash;  whose name was changed from the Bullets over gun-violence concerns. </p>
<p>It was the three-time all-star Arenas, 27, who went for his gun first, sources said, drawing on the 22-year-old Crittenton, who quickly brandished a firearm as well. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>The duel in DC  &mdash;  unprecedented in sports history  &mdash;  was sparked when Crittenton became enraged at the veteran guard for refusing to make good on a gambling debt, a source said. </p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not your punk!&#8221; Crittenton shouted at Arenas, according to a league source close to the Wizards. </p>
<p>That prompted Arenas to draw on Crittenton, who then also grabbed for a gun, league security sources said. </p>
<p>A playground pal of Crittenton&rsquo;s from Atlanta, Kendrick &#8220;Bookie Ball&#8221; Long, confirmed the locker-room standoff and said he learned of it directly from the third-year player out of Georgia Tech. </p>
<p>&#8220;He [Arenas] was f  &mdash;    &mdash;  ing with him; he [Crittenton] was just defending himself!&#8221; declared Long, who said the dispute was over money but would not elaborate. </p>
<p>The Wizards announced on Christmas Day that Arenas had admitted to bringing guns to the locker room and had turned them over to team security. No ammunition was handed over. </p>
<p>Today, the Wizards in a statement said they &#8220;take this situation and the ongoing investigation very seriously. We are continuing to cooperate fully with the proper authorities and the NBA and will have no further comment at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Washington police said they were investigating Arenas for gun-possession violations. But the Wizards&rsquo; gun grab has also drawn the attention of the feds. </p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re working with the Metropolitan Police Department on the investigation. That&rsquo;s about all we can say at his point,&#8221; said Ben Friedman, a spokesman for the US Attorney&rsquo;s Office in DC. </p>
<p>The feds have been investigating gambling within the NBA since disgraced ex-referee Tim Donaghy admitted betting on games and feeding information to bookies. It was not clear whether the gambling debt that sparked the Arenas-Crittenton duel had anything to do with league games. </p>
<p>A top players-union official said he was shocked by the allegations. &#8220;This is unprecedented in the history of sports,&#8221; said Player&rsquo;s Association Executive Director Billy Hunter. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve never heard of players pulling guns on each other in a locker room.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arenas, who has three kids, reportedly told team officials he brought guns to his Verizon Center locker so they wouldn&rsquo;t be close to his newborn at their home in Great Falls, Va. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Firearm laws in Washington are among the nation&rsquo;s strictest. Until a recent US Supreme Court ruling, private ownership of guns was illegal in the nation&rsquo;s capital. </p>
<p>As it stands now, gun owners are allowed to transport firearms only within DC under very limited circumstances  &mdash;  such as taking the weapon to be registered or to a practice range. There&rsquo;s no provision under current DC law for a private citizen to have a gun at work. </p>
<p>In 2003, Arenas pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of carrying a concealed weapon in San Francisco. </p>

		<p>This would be comical if it wasn&rsquo;t so typical.</p>
<p>No one who is familiar with the behavior of professional black athletes should be surprised.</p>
<p>Remember Ray Carruth of the Carolina Panthers?  He had his pregnant girlfriend and unborn child murdered for $20,000 so he wouldn&rsquo;t have to pay child support.</p>
<p>How about Charles Barkley, famous for spitting at a fan?  Or Ron Artest, another one of baskeball&rsquo;s fine black gentleman.  Rapist Mike Tyson, anyone?</p>
<p>I go to the gym at my local YMCA all the time.  I&rsquo;ve yet to feel the need to carry a gun.  Maybe I should, though.  That way I can be ready to pistol whip one of the little kids who run around the locker room.</p>
<p>I guess this one of those black things whites just don&rsquo;t understand.</p>

		<p>Your average citizen would have been arrested for possesion of a wepon in the DC metro area. What does his newborn have to do with illegaly brandishing a firearm? That&rsquo;s the same old lame excuse used when people get caught selling drugs and they say &#8220;My kid needed diapers&#8221; so I sell drugs.</p>

		<p>Now how many white basketball players have taken thuggery to the low that Mr. Arenas and the young punk he faced off with decided to employ?  None.  Mr. Arenas is paid a lot of money and produces little, as DC fans know. And as for his claim he brought the guns to the Verizon Center, a vast heavily populated public arena in the heart of the DC entertainment district, to avoid having firearms near his tots, this is as absurd as multimillionaires &#8220;gambling&#8221; to chisel a few extra bucks. Dump the guns on the White House Lawn, Mr. Arenas. Your soulmate, Mr. &#8220;Obama&#8221;, can donate them to his top notch security forces protecting our airports from Muslim thugs now free from tough military or CIA interrogation. See how complicated it is, Mr. Arenas?</p>

<p>Yes, it it wasn&rsquo;t for whitey all people of color would lead a very happy existence and all of them would live happily ever after.</p>
<p>Just look at how happy they are to note that whitey&rsquo;s numbers are getting to be less as a percentage of the population with each passing year.  </p>
<p>When they are a majority, they will be successful beyond their wildest dreams, just like when Obama was elected.  Just as they knew they would, they are all driving plush autos and are living in 25 room mansions. </p>
<p>And some people say blacks have a problem perceiving reality and think in terms of fairy tales.</p>
<p>Nonsense.</p>

		<p>As a former New York Knicks season ticket holder, and probably still more a fan of the thug-riddled NBA than I should be, I have been following this story closely over the past week.  I have visited all of the message boards pertaining to the story on ESPN.com, as a way to sort of gauge the view of the general public on this debacle.  And let me say that, while still heavily outnumbered, I was pleasantly surprised at the relative number of people denouncing these hoodlums and the thug-culture that continues to permeate a league that is 80-85% black.  There are those (almost every black, and far too many Whites) who I&rsquo;m sure will never change, but I hold out hope that oh so slowly, some Whites are beginning to wake up and realize the inherent truths about these mongrels that we unfortunately share a country with.   </p>

		<p>Geeze what a surprise. We take thugs from duh Hood, pay them millions, but are shocked and appalled when they do what they do best. I&rsquo;d wager (no pun intended) that there were lots of <br>
&#8220;Muhf  &mdash;  -ahs&#8221; flying around the air in that locker room. <br>
If guys like Al Capone, Charlie Luciano and Meier Lanski had possessed athletic talent, maybe they could have become heros to millions of American kids. All they needed was a push in the right direction. Oh that&rsquo;s right!  They lacked the protective pigmentation.</p>

		<p>Whenever I head out for Moscow on the Potomac, I am armed to the teeth. If you don`t have a gun when crossing the 14th Street Bridge, they should give you one. It is a good sign that the 150,000,000,000. we have spent of minority education has at last taught these down trodden folks the value of firearms.<br>
     My Marine Drill instructor taught me at Pre-Flight in Pensacola to never point a weapon at somebody unless you want to kill them, Arenas and Crittendon must not have had a Marine DI.The NBA is quite advanced in these matters. The players contract states that on the team plane their luggage is not to be searched or players forced to endure the profiling of a magnatometer. I am troubled about the gamboling thing. Arenas makes 10 mill a year and Crittendon only 1 mill. What kind of action would upset Arenas to the point of being forced to rely on his second amendment rights? These guys wouldn`t kill the golden goose by fixing games would they? Buy your kids 300 dollar a pop sneakers; get the NBA package on your cable for 100 per year; send your kids to basketball camps. It`s money well spent.<br>

		<p>This episode proves once again, that guns aren&rsquo;t the problem - sometimes it&rsquo;s the people holding them, that are the problem. In this, case it&rsquo;s Arenas and Crittenton, two reasons why there are some 22,000 gun laws on the books.</p>
<p>Abe Pollin must be spinning in his grave, since he changed the name of the team to the &#8220;Wizards&#8221;, because he didn&rsquo;t like &#8220;Bullets&#8221;.</p>
<p>You can put all the lipstick in the world on a pig, but it&rsquo;s still a pig.</p>
<p>This episode, and the one involving Sean Taylor of the Redskins puts the lie to the Great Society adage that poverty is the reason that inner-city Bantus behave the way they do; and if only they had jobs, then they wouldn&rsquo;t be involved in crime.</p>
<p>Well, Bantus are paid millions, and they STILL behave like they never left the hood. See the above comment about putting lipstick on a pig.  </p>

		<p>On the humorous side, the Wizzies are on the hook for Gilbert Arenas&rsquo; contract of $ 110 million.  GA&rsquo;s a shooting guard trapped in a point guard&rsquo;s body, a defensive liability, very selfish, and untradeable.  What started as a season of high promise for the Wizards has turned into a high-priced disaster and the talk in Washington is of a fire sale of tradeable players for draft picks.  Very rich fun, the Wizzies, due to a change of season, succeed the hapless pigskin quitters called the Redskins as the local macabre sports entertainment, the Redskins having followed the equally pathetic baseball Nationals with its squad of Dominicans to give DC a trifecta in athletic incompetence.</p>

		<p>Question:</p>
<p>Do any of you think that incidents like these happen more often than the media put on?   There are a lot of things they can cover up, but there are also a lot of things they can&rsquo;t.  We know that black athletes tend to the rowdy and criminal, and that&rsquo;s just what they tell us.  I deduce that there&rsquo;s a lot they&rsquo;re not telling us.</p>

		<p>I hope this doesn&rsquo;t really suprise anyone too much.  Pro sports are just a cross section of actual society.  Who is behaving and who is offending?  Larry Bird was no saint, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure he never pulled guns on team mates, tortured pets, instigated night club riots, been pulled over with a trunk load of guns, etc.</p>
<p>The NBA was once a decent league.  The most successful players needed mental toughness, integrity, and the sharpest fundamentals to be the best at their game.  Now many of the &#8220;stars&#8221; have ZERO mental toughness or integrity. (Think of the USA using NBA&rsquo;s elite getting embarressed in olympic play)  The leagues best players now are physical beasts who are simply able to bully and thug their way to the hoop overcoming their opponent with brute force only.  The rules used to require speed and finesse to get by your man.  Now, just run him right the heck over.  The only glimmer of value in the NBA now are foreign players who made it to the top with sheer fundamental ability.  They actually play, wait for it, basketball.</p>
<p>I used to emulate Bird&rsquo;s shooting form or John Stockton&rsquo;s defence.  Today&rsquo;s youngsters aspire only to dunk followed by wretched trash talk.  The untimate lesson from the NBA to our youth is &#8216;look goog.&rsquo;  Seriously, its fine to lose, let your teammates down, break the rules, cheat, and taunt as long as you look good doing it.  Folks, nothing will make you puke faster than watching a sixth grader immitate his favorite NBA hero in a &#8220;little shooters tourney.&#8221; </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hate the game of basketball because its been destroyed at the pro level.  People ask me why I hate the NBA.  The answer is simple.  I love basketball, that&rsquo;s WHY I hate the NBA.</p>

		<p>The funniest (and most ironic) thing about this is that our favorite race-baiting overweight, california raisin fake-hair having hate-monger reverend Al Sharpton got involved. He said that (he must not have had an editor nearby) if a white player had pulled a gun on a black player it would have been all over the paper. He said that we&rsquo;ve accepted this from blacks that they can&rsquo;t do anything to better themselves. Well he&rsquo;s right. If a white guy did this, he&rsquo;d be banned for life from the game, lose all sponsors (if he had any) and probably face jail time. But on the other hand, if a white guy pulled a gun on a black guy it probably would have been after escaping a life-threatening situation or executing a citizen&rsquo;s arrest. </p>

		<p>A little off topic of the NBA&hellip;. but has anyone noticed the Western and Midwest schools(majority white players)whupped all the black-laden schools in the recent football bowl games. I think order/discipline/coachability is finally overtaking speed/immorality/thuggishness in the world of sports.My local college football team are perrenial losers and loaded with blacks.I always tell my wife we can go 0-11 with white kids that don&rsquo;t rape and pillage the campus.</p>

		<p>I am an NBA fan. There, I said it. I also happen to be a white nationalist. I don&rsquo;t really see why the two must be mutually exclusive. Do I wish there more more white players (particularly white Americans) in the NBA? Do I wish that many of the black stars I watch weren&rsquo;t covered in so many tattoos? Do I wish that the NBA didn&rsquo;t have such a thuggish image? Absolutely! That being said, I still enjoy watching match-ups between different teams and players. The level of play is very intense and the competition can be exciting (I happen to be a Cavs fan). Not all black players are thugs. For every Ron Artest, Rasheed Wallace, Kenyon Martin and Gilbert Arenas, there&rsquo;s a Shane Battier, LeBron James (regardless of his poor sportsmanship at times), and Tim Duncan. Despite LeBron&rsquo;s tattoos and headband, he isn&rsquo;t afflicted by the same thuggish personality that plagues many other NBA players. Someday there might be more white (or even Asian and Hispanic) players in the NBA. For now I cheer for Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash. </p>

		<p>To whiteguysrevenge (re post # 26):</p>
<p>Reading your post, I got the impression that Sharpton did all he could to keep from crying, that he was actually LAMENTING that it wasn&rsquo;t a case of a white guy (especially a white police officer) pulling a gun on a Bantu. Instead, he&rsquo;s upset that this facet of Bantu behavior is accepted as part of the norm, by whites. And he doesn&rsquo;t like it. He can&rsquo;t accept the fact that Arenas and Crittenton are paid millions of dollars, so he can&rsquo;t bleat the same tired cannard of &#8220;hopelessness, poverty and despair be causin&rsquo; our people to kill each other&#8221;, in this case.</p>

<p>Dogs are capable of biting men.</p>
<p>Blacks pull guns on each other.</p>
<p>Ho hum, so what else is new?</p>

		<p>I bet they held their guns sideways, too.</p>
<p>How long before NBA teams change their names to something more reflective of their underlying nature?  We can look forward to a championship game between the Chicago Thugs and the Washington Pimps.</p>
