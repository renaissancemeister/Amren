<h1>White Children Now a Minority in California, States Report</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dennis Romero, LA Weekly, January 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Don&rsquo;t tell the producers of The Hills or any of the other youth-oriented television shows that seem to portray people of color as background noise in California, but for the Golden State&rsquo;s under-18 population whites are now a minority.</p>
<p>This according to U.S. Census data from 2000 to 2009 analyzed by the New York Times, which attributes the shift, in part, to higher birth rates among immigrants. {snip}</p>
<p>The emergence of a nonwhite majority among children should be no surprise to Angelenos, who live in a city that is nearly 50 percent Latino. And, as LAist reported this week, Latinos have now edged out whites as the largest ethnic group in the once Leave It To Beaver-like San Fernando Valley.</p>
<p>Meanwhile California joins Arizona, Hawaii, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas as states where &#8220;minority&#8221; non-adults are now the majority. {snip}</p>

		<p> Note the condescending tone about &#8220;Leave it to Beaver,&#8221; etc. The message of the piece is unmistakable: &#8220;Your days are numbered, White racists! You&rsquo;re losing your own country, and we couldn&rsquo;t be happier about it!&#8221; Those who have hated the White race for years   &mdash;   many of them White themselves   &mdash;   can&rsquo;t wait for the day when we are in a minority in the country as a whole. They can&rsquo;t wait for us to become the United States of Brazil.</p>

		<p>We could have told you this 10 years ago, especially those of us who taught in public schools at that time!!!  I taught for 10 years, with an average of 30 students per class - that&rsquo;s roughly 300 kids, and I remember 3 white kids.  Unfortunate white kids, I might add&hellip;.</p>

		<p>As recently as 1970 California was 80% White. Just 40 years ago. Only a blink of an eye in a country&rsquo;s history. Now in just another 40 years - 2050 - the whole country will be like this. California itself will be indistinguishable from Mexico and America will be Brazil. The America of Wahington, Lincoln, FDR and Eisenhower is gone forever. Its as crazy as it is sad.</p>

I&rsquo;m in a smaller town, and on any given day, at any intersection, you can look around you and see Mexicans all around you&hellip;out of, say, 12 cars, you might see eight filled with Mexicanos.<br>
Drive by some schools, and note 2 or 3 of 5 kids are Mexican.<br>
See any roup of mom and three to five kids, and then notice the dirty pink clothes of the little girls (what is it with Mexicans and dirty pink clothes on little girls?), and the black hair, and bingo! more Mexicans. <br>
Go to a Wal Mart and listen to jabbering Spanish all around you.<br>

		<p>If I would be an American (I am German) I would go to one State, buy very lot land and just forbid blacks to get into this land to save white race.<br>
The whites in SA did the same and made a village called &#8220;Orania&#8221;. It&rsquo;s small because the most whites just wanted to get out of the country. But it seems, whites are going to be nowhere forthemselves and nowhere save.<br>
If you don&rsquo;t, you are going to have the same future as most whites getting minorities in their country: The none-Whites vote for the politicians who want to take the money and land of whites an give it to none-whites. The same happened in Zimbabwe and SA.<br>
Good luck</p>

		<p>Wait a minute..I don&rsquo;t get this.  European Americans were determined to be a minority in California back in 1998, and that was European Americans as a whole, not just the under 18 population.  So why is this coming out now?  I see an inconsistency here  &mdash;  unless they mean &#8220;Whites&#8221; including Hispanic &#8220;Whites&#8221;?  The media is so inconsistent  &mdash;  the problem is, most people don&rsquo;t seem to think to read between the lines when reading this stuff.</p>

<p>   It looks like parts of New England, the Midwest, Upper Midwest and Far West will be the last redoubts of white people. I fear the too –hospitable- to- minorities Pacific Northwest will be the next to go minority in the next ten years.  Of course, whites will be concentrated in the smaller rural towns and medium sized cities but the minorities are following &mdash; even to Mars as Chris Rock once said. </p>

		<p>I just received the 2010 Language Arts and social Studies catalog of Random House.  It&rsquo;s catalog like these that English teachers use to choose reading lit. for their classes.  In 30 pages of adverts for books, only 8-9 of the authors are white males.  The other 60 or so books are &#8220;multicultural.&#8221;  Nearly all of those are of the social justice variety.  &#8220;Oh the hardships (fill in the blank) faced from the oppressive white man.&#8221;  Nearly every &#8220;English&#8221; teacher I&rsquo;ve met who is under 30 uses their &#8220;English&#8221; class as a place to promote &#8220;social justice&#8221; and &#8220;diversity.&#8221;  Sometimes I get just plain sick of seeing it.  The old, dead white authors have been largely abandoned.  Who will be able to talk about human rights in the hip-hop themed (anti-reading) future given that nearly all aspects of this philosophy are rooted in the concepts and writings of old, dead white men?</p>

<p>To clarify:</p>
<p>Whites became a minority in the entire United States in 1964.  Then they became non-citizens in 1965.  The lapse in time for recognizing these demotions was caused by a delay in the brain that actually processes survival information.  The delay is called &#8216;brainwashing&rsquo; and whites are very susceptible to it.</p>
<p>Hope this clears it up for you!</p>
<p>As one Amerener once remarked, &#8220;compassion is the White man&rsquo;s Achilles heel.&#8221;<br>

		<p>&#8220;But still the excuses for Affirmative Action will continue&#8221;.</p>
<p>To a certain degree, the influx itself sparks the &#8216;need&rsquo; for affirmative action. Non-whites in America have an average age close to around 20, the White population has an average age around 40. Older people on average, have a higher income than do those who are younger. However, the left in the country, that is, the establishment, continue to point to the income difference in efforts to &#8216;close the gaps&rsquo; and in the process remind us that whites are disciminating against everyone else, and quite frankly, evil. </p>
<p>This is probably even more true (older people earn more than those who are younger) in a nation such as Mexico. </p>

		<p>Just because Mexican illegal children now outnumber American children in L.A. does not mean American children no longer exist. The Mexican children have their own language, culture and, most importantly, their own media. The remaining Americans in the L.A. area still have their own culture and have every right to portray it in their own shows like The Hills. If dark English speaking children want to see themselves overrepresented in white culture just switch on the Disney Channel.</p>

		<p>This unsurprising statistic could also have to do with the fact that between 1990 and 2007 3.4 million more Americans moved from California to one of the other 49 states than moved to California from another state.  The exodus was undoubtedly comprised primarily of productive white families.  My family happened to be a part of that statistic, having left in 2004 for Montana.  I have never looked back and can now laugh at the financial havoc that liberalism has wreaked upon one of the world&rsquo;s largest economies.  Montana, on the other hand, is one of only two states with a government that is operating with a budget surplus.  </p>

<p>California officially became White minority back in 2000 and White children would have to have become a minority long before that.  I don&rsquo;t understand it either unless they&rsquo;re only counting US citizens this time.  The California electorate is 66 percent White so that must mean 66 percent of the legal citizens of California are White.  <br>

		<p>I believe one can turn a stampede by dropping a few lead animals.  The same will prove true for Mexicans.  Once a few have been forcibly sent to join their ancestors the remaining vast majority will return to Mexico as fast as they can.  Even Mexicans are smart enough to know that sooner or later they will be made to suffer the consequences of their criminal actions against us&hellip;</p>

		<p>#1 Wayne Engel, I did note the condescending tone about &#8220;Leave It to Beaver&#8221;. In fact, I heard a hispanic college aged woman, on a talk in Lost Angeles, literally use the same phrase in discussing the &#8220;New America&#8221;, as she called it. She said, and this is a direct quote,&#8221;this(the U.S.)isn&rsquo;t &#8220;Leave it To Beaver&#8221; anymore&#8221;. I was about to call in to the show but realized it was probably taped earlier. I wanted to give her my take on the Leave It to Beaver comment.</p>
<p>I wanted to agree with her by saying that, it sure isn&rsquo;t, Leave it Beaver, because you could tell by the massive amount of graffitti everywhere in California, and gangs committing drive by killings, and the increased theft and dishonesty and the  illegal aliens that constantly take off after they hit someone with a car they shouldn&rsquo;t be driving,etc.etc. RIGHT, LEAVE IT TO BEAVER IS LONG GONE. I believe this arrogant girl said she was attending UCLA, which also didn&rsquo;t surprise me.</p>

		<p>Multiculturalism does not work, never did.  The white European Christian nations have flourished, are the envy of the world.  We will and are becoming as a third world country, with the black and browns wanting to come in and trash our countries.  If they can&rsquo;t make something of their countries, how are they going to contribute to this nation rightfully (and I don&rsquo;t mean more people)&hellip;THEY CAN&rsquo;T.  I guess they feel a need to trash ours.  I don&rsquo;t want barbarism in this country.  We&rsquo;re supposed to be a civil nation.  We need to stop all immigration, even if Americans have to stand at the borders, guns in tows.  It appears the browns and blacks don&rsquo;t know how to govern their nations, that is why their countries are as they are&hellip;poor and overpopulated.  They overbreed, become impoverished.  This is why their nations leaders go on rampages, and kill their own people.</p>
