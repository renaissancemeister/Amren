			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stuff Black People Don&rsquo;t Like, January 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The &#8220;Mainstreaming&#8221; of positive images of Black people at the helm of the United States government has been an on-going phenomenon for the past 30 years. The concept of mainstreaming is important to SBPDL, for it means creating conditioned responses in a population for eventualities to unfold without opposition or resentment:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nightly newscasts reinforce seemingly pre-conditioned response of resentment and prejudicial images of Black people in the majority population, thereby creating a false impression of wanton Black criminality and violence. Utilizing cultivation theory, the heroic images of Black people succeeding at sports leads to improving caustic thoughts of Black people and in turn, creates an environment where Black criminality is excused for the athletic contributions of this adroit people far out-weigh incarceration rates or rising opportunity costs of white flight from major cities.</p>
<p>When considering [Barack] Obama&rsquo;s election, one must recall the giants whose shoulders he stood upon to be granted access into the White House: those portrayals by Black actors of Black presidents in popular culture, from television to movies. For, the &#8220;mainstreaming&#8221; of the notion of a fictional Black president had to be conditioned to the majority population before the reality could occur:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hollywood has cast some heavyweight Black actors in the role of the United States president, with oddly coincidental thematic undertones. We shall get to this in a moment, but a quick run-down of the fictional Black presidents in film should illustrate the point:</p>
<p>1. Deep Impact (1998)<br>
Actor: Morgan Freeman<br>
POTUS: Tom Beck</p>
<p>Not to be confused with the same year&rsquo;s Armageddon, about astronauts nuking an asteroid on a collision course with the Earth, Deep Impact is about nuking a comet on a collision course with the Earth. It&rsquo;s also about an MSNBC reporter so darling, as played by TÃ©a Leoni, that the president gives her something of a scoop about the comet-nuking mission.</p>
<p>2. The Fifth Element (1997)<br>
Actor: Tommy &#8220;Tiny&#8221; Lister<br>
POTUS: President Lindberg</p>
<p>Luc Besson&rsquo;s wiggy fantasia tells the story of a planet representing pure evil on a collision course with the Earth in the 23rd century. Instead of nukes, our weapon against it is Milla Jovovich&rsquo;s bandage-attired supernatural sylph, and one President Lindberg oversees her deployment.</p>
<p>3. Idiocracy (2006)<br>
Actor: Terry Crews<br>
POTUS: Dwayne Camacho</p>
<p>Mike Judge&rsquo;s sci-fi satire unfolds in the 26th century in a United States whose degraded citizens habitually deaden themselves with video games and fast food. (The movie is a cult classic, rather than a popular favorite, because its absurdism hits too close to home.) Luke Wilson  &mdash;  playing the &#8220;most average&#8221; soldier in the Army of 2005  &mdash;  awakes from Rip Van Winkle hibernation to find that he&rsquo;s the smartest guy in the country and soon joins the Cabinet of President Camacho, who entered the political arena via the wrestling arena. While Camacho&rsquo;s skin color is much really less of an issue than, say, the fact that he commands respect at the State of the Union by firing an automatic rifle at the ceiling, his processed hair and street idiom do lend an extra outlandish to the apocalyptic portrait.</p>
<p>Not profiled in this article is a late arriver to the party of fictitious Black presidents is President Thomas Wilson of the recent film 2012, played by Danny Glover (sadly, his Vice President was not Martin Riggs).</p>
<p>In television, the &#8220;mainstreaming&#8221; of a Black president fell to the good-hands of Dennis Haysbert, as he was cast as the president in 24: <blockquote>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not until the hit series &#8220;24&#8221; that things start looking up for the black president. Dennis Haysbert&rsquo;s character, David Palmer  &mdash;  in the first season a senator running for the presidency  &mdash;  is handsome, composed and ready to lead on Day One. His race is a non-issue as he grapples with modern-day threats such as terrorism, bomb scares and a social-climbing wife.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>The path to the White House for [Barack] Obama was lined with the horrific &#8220;mainstreaming&#8221; of end-of-the-world scenarios that Black presidents constantly presided over (Danny Glover was cast in 2012 before the election of [Barack] Obama for those wondering, meaning Hollywood was prepared to continue to the &#8220;mainstreaming&#8221; of end-of-the-world scenarios with Black people at the helm of the US Government).</p>
<p>A synthesis of disaster and Black presidents has occurred through the &#8220;mainstreaming&#8221; of Hollywood films and television shows that showcase Black POTUS being elected at the unlucky moment right before Armageddon strikes. Consider, Deep Impact, a film where most of the United States is destroyed by a rouge comet from Outer space. Morgan Freeman&rsquo;s Godlike abilities fail to prevent widespread destruction.</p>
<p>2012 shows a world where nearly 99 percent of the population is wiped out thanks to solar flares from the sun melting the earth&rsquo;s core. The Black POTUS is helpless in stopping the mass murder of the United States population by the remorseless power of nature.</p>
<p>In Idiocracy, a film that dares discusses the verboten topic of inherited intelligence in individuals; a Black person is once again president when the planet is on the verge of a dystopian nightmare reserved for the pages James Watson&rsquo;s diary.</p>
<p>Thus, an observable pattern develops between Black people in film and television and the end-of-the-world that a few people have noticed, yet completely misdiagnose.</p>
<p>[Barack] Obama was elected at a time when the United States stands on the verge of collapse and the &#8220;mainstreaming&#8221; of disastrous scenarios through the medium of film and television conditioned all American&rsquo;s for this event, and the Black person at the helm of the nation underscores this situation.</p>
<p>Black actors are on speed-dial by Hollywood executives for POTUS roles, as the blame for apocalyptic events in film must always rest on the shoulders of Black people in the role of POTUS. {snip}<br>

<p>Laughably, the people at &ldquo;Stuff Black People Don&rsquo;t Like&rdquo; are on our side. Thus, most observations referable, are of course to an insane asylum!</p>
<p>We have done nothing wrong; moreover, we have done as much right and allocated as we can. </p>

		<p>How many have noticed that in Deep Impact it&rsquo;s the black president that declares martial law?</p>
<p>And no one bats an eyelash at this.  The president in the movie also freezes all wages and prices, and I&rsquo;m thinking to myself&hellip;does the president have the power to do such a thing?<br>

		<p>I was going to bring up &#8216;the fifth element&rsquo; but I see the authors get to that. It&rsquo;s not a very thorough list. The must be dozens of these &#8216;black president&rsquo; movies. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Hollywood consistently shows black presidents as helpless in the face of disasters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just like in Haiti right now. And in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>However, with all due respect to Mother Nature, living under black rule is the greatest disaster of all. </p>

<p>Could New Orleans Mayor Nagin&rsquo;s mishandling of the hurricane Katrina disaster have provided the model for this?</p>

		<p>To Alexandra:</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know how old you are, but in 1971, Nixon ordered a 90-day &#8220;freeze&#8221; on wages and prices in the country. He thought it would bring down the rate of inflation, from 6% to 2%. He was worried about re-election, of course.</p>
<p>The result was that inflation jumped to nearly 9% after the freeze was over. </p>

		<p>Well, all these Hollywood brainwashing movies sure did work on those stupid, not very bright, white sod-busters up in Iowa - who were instrumental in helping to install this Mulatto Messiah into the house at 1600 PA Avenue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, but over the years, I&rsquo;ve had a running argument going with a white male friend of mine - who flat out refuses to accept the idea that this Hollywood crowd is interested in anything except making money.   Hard heads seem to be a common ethnic flaw in the white race, and white males seem to suffer from this disease more than any other ethnic group.</p>
<p>You know what?  I think that if we don&rsquo;t figure out how to cure this disease, we are not going to win this fight.   </p>

		<p>I hope Luke is being sarcastic about the sod busters up in Iowa helping elect Obama. Because Obama got through on the votes of the very non-white and leftist voters located on the East and West Coasts, and the blacks and their enablers in the South. He had thin support if at all in the rest of the country. I live in L.A. and even the latinos voted for Obama, because he wasn&rsquo;t white. Along with the &#8216;sophisticated&rsquo; West Side morons here in town and the brainwashed doltish whites who seem to be the majority of whites in every big city in the US. </p>
