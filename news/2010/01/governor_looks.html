<h1><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2010/01/26/MNV11BND6M.DTL">Governor Looks South of the Border for Prisons</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Wyatt Buchanan, San Francisco Chronicle, January 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The governor floated the idea during an appearance at the Sacramento Press Club in response to a question about controlling state spending. His speech came on the same day that changes in prisoner parole and credits for time served took effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;We pay them to build the prisons down in Mexico and then we have those undocumented immigrants be down there in a prison.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And all this, it would be half the cost to build the prisons and half the cost to run the prisons,&#8221; Schwarzenegger said, predicting it would save the state $1 billion that could be spent on higher education.</p>
<p>About 19,000 of the state&rsquo;s 171,000 prisoners are illegal immigrants, according to the most recent statistics available online. The state spends more than $8 billion a year on the prison system.</p>
<p>Aaron McLear, spokesman for the governor, said later that Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s comments did not represent a concrete proposal, but &#8220;a concept somebody mentioned to him&#8221; and he could not say where the governor came up with the $1 billion figure.</p>
<p>The governor&rsquo;s statements seemed to catch his prisons chief off guard. Matthew Cate, secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said it was not a proposal the department was pursuing and he assumed it was an extension of Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s call to privatize some of the state&rsquo;s prison operations.</p>
<p><b>Privatizing prisons</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After the governor spoke Monday, Cate said the department has not reviewed or analyzed the Mexico proposal and said the department has no projections of how much money the state could save. He also acknowledged it could raise a host of jurisdictional and other issues.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>California is currently under a federal court order to reduce its prison population by 40,000 inmates over the next two years. A federal judge installed a receiver in 2006 to oversee inmate health care in state prisons, finding that substandard care led to the death of about one prisoner per week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The governor&rsquo;s idea also drew criticism from the prison guards union.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a number of reasons why it not only won&rsquo;t work, but shouldn&rsquo;t work,&#8221; said Lance Corcoran, spokesman for the California Correctional Peace Officers Association. &#8220;There is no obligation from a sovereign nation to incarcerate and rehabilitate individuals who have not committed crimes within their borders.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This does not require a rocket scientist. Send them back, with the understanding if they return to the U S, they get the death penalty. Of course that would never happen. Oh! and that thing about us being a sovereign nation, just give king Hussein a bit longer, since he recently signed an executive order, giving interpol total authority over all agencies in the U S, and has openly stated he thinks we should no longer be a sovereign nation. All hail the king.</p>

		<p>Interestingly, I see this as a highly innovative suggestion to the problem of  &ldquo;the undocumented&rdquo; in this country as a whole, and not just the ones who are convicted criminals once they have invaded our land. You see, these invaders are not citizens and they have no &ldquo;rights&rdquo; as far as I am concerned; when we simply expel them, they often just return without a care in the world. So, the solution to the problem is making the act of invasion so unfathomably odious to them in reality, that the act has no rewards and only severe punishments. </p>
<p>A prison loosely controlled by the USA in Mexico for our invaders from all countries, not just Mexico, is a possibly plausible answer to the problem. The prison need not be a four star one, or even rate any stars by our prisons&rsquo; standards; in fact, it could be beneath abysmal by even Mexican standards. Moreover, it could just be a deep and large hole in the ground with bars covering the top of it, that the US or California security forces prevent escape from and Mexico provides &ldquo;amenities&rdquo;  for. </p>
<p>Think about it, such a proposal offers endless solutions to an &ldquo;unsolvable&rdquo; problem!</p>

		<p>Sounds like a GREAT idea to me!!!  Get &#8216;em out of our country and down to Mexico, where they can enjoy the water and sanitary systems!  I love it!  As a Californian, I do understand the need to reduce the overcrowding in our prisons; conditions there are truly inhumane.  So let&rsquo;s transfer all Hispanic prisoners to Mexico and let THEM handle their own!!!</p>

		<p>I have a better idea: Work harder to prevent illegals from coming here in the first place before they have the opportunity to commit crimes.Arnee,with his IQ of 101, should be able to figure this out,but he is playing dumb, which for him is not hard to do.</p>

<p>When those individuals are citizens of a sovereign nation that encouraged them to enter our country illegally I would say that that sovereign nation has an obligation to incarcerate them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve outsourced half our manufacturing to Mexico, we may as well outsource the prisons.</p>

		<p>Wow..we cant build a fence along the Mexican border to keep them out. But we can build an entire prison in Mexico..along with buildings, mess halls, showers, gymns and color TVs..and presumably fences ..but only  after they rape, murder and steal from US citizens. </p>
<p>Am I missing something here?.sanity perhaps?</p>

		<p>Great! I hope they do not limit it to Mexican criminals, they should send black criminals too. I have always had this idea.<br>
Since we give so much aid to African nations, lets make that aid with conditions. The condition being that they accept all the black criminals of Europe and North America and give them citizenhship.</p>

		<p>Now that is one sector the US SHOULD actively and aggressively outsource.</p>
<p>Instead of sending tech sector jobs to india where they only really pretend to do the job, nothing gets done, and then the company shuts down that division, we could pay india, mexico, china, etc. to take our black and hispanic criminals.</p>

		<p>Better idea is to outsource prisons for non-US citizens to China, or perhaps Indonesia.  It needs to be some place where Spanish language will just get you picked up quicker if you escape, and where MS-13 membership is merely a tattoo that warns the guards you may be trouble.</p>
<p>In Schwartzenegger&rsquo;s scheme, the criminal infrastructure of Latin states will give high value prisoners a virtual free ride.  Typical of A.S. to only go half way with his ideas.</p>

		<p>This seems like a good idea, but do we want the State of California to have prisons/offices in Mexico?  State goverments should not have offices in other countries.  Pretty soon everything will be shared with Mexico and we will have no borders, just the North American Union.  </p>

That&rsquo;ll never happen.  The unions won&rsquo;t allow it.  The Mexicans will never by it.  And if they do, they&rsquo;ll just pocket the money and let the prisoners go.  Crime against gringos isn&rsquo;t seen as real crime in Mexico.</p>

		<p>Demography is destiny. Ever since Arnold Schwarzenegger became the Republican Governor of California, he has been trying the best he could, to stop the unbelievable amount of wasted taxpayer money. He created a proposition to cut the insane benefits of publica employees, such as their pay and pension. For example, a California prison guard receives tht starting pay of about 72,000 dollars a year. This is roughly 40percent more than the average prison guard gets in other states. The same goes for fireman, police, teachers, janitors, cubicle workers and literally thousands of other jobs classified as government jobs. The governor gave Californians a chance to vote on bringing the compensation these &#8220;civil servants&#8221; receive to a reasonable level. Result, the initiative was easily defeated and Schwarzenegger had egg on his face.</p>
<p>Conclusion: California has morons for citizens and the leftists and Mexican politicians, along with the massive amount of illegal aliens in the state, and more that come every single day, has clinched the matter. Nothing can be done to help California. Short of some violent revolution that would bring it back to its former glory, it is LOST. No politician is going to ever challenge the millions of illegal aliens and their enablers, because they represent a potential for total violence, and in the end, the majority of Californians aren&rsquo;t going to challenge any of it. The Republicans were as much to blame as the Democrats for this situation, and that is why these two political parties must quietly go into the night, or the California phenomenon will go from state to state.</p>
