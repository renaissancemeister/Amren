			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laura Clark, Daily Mail (London), January 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They had been looking forward to their half-term excursions for weeks.</p>
<p>But dozens of children have been barred from school trips to a safari park, football ground and indoor ski centre because their parents are too well-off.</p>
<p>Families said their children had been left in tears, unable to understand why they were banned from going on trips with their friends.</p>
<p>Last night council officials were accused of penalising working parents as only &#8216;economically disadvantaged&rsquo; pupils can take part in the excursions.</p>
<p>A Government-funded scheme, being trialled across Trafford Council in Greater Manchester, is open only to children who receive free school meals because their parents are on benefits.</p>
<p>Families not on state support are not eligible for the trips to Knowsley Safari Park, football sessions with the Manchester United Foundation and a day at the Chill Factore indoor snow centre, even if the parents are willing to pay. Sarah Rumney, whose five-year-old son attends Partington Primary School, said he had been upset when told he could not go on the outings.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m really angry,&rsquo; she said. &#8216;I&rsquo;m being penalised for working and wanting to do better for myself and my children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The 29-year-old self-employed cleaner was willing to pay for her son to take part but was told places were restricted.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s a nightmare. What sort of incentive does it give to these kids to want to go out and work if all their friends are allowed to go on fantastic trips but they aren&rsquo;t? I&rsquo;m quite annoyed about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margaret Woodhouse, from Trafford Council&rsquo;s children and young people&rsquo;s service, confirmed 22 schools in the area had been included in the pilot scheme.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;It was a government requirement the money be used to support children from &#8220;economically disadvantaged&#8221; families within the area. Trafford Council chose to follow the guidance from the Training and Development Agency  &mdash;  responsible for allocating funding on the government&rsquo;s behalf  &mdash;  and use free school meals as its criteria.</p>
<p>&#8216;This ensures the funding goes to support children from lower-income families.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But yesterday the Government said the council appeared to have missed the point of the scheme. Officials said the aim was to ensure all children were able to enjoy out-of-school activities  &mdash;  regardless of their parents&rsquo; income.</p>
<p>A spokesman at the Department for Children, Schools and Families said: &#8216;Our guidance is crystal clear that no child should be left out.</p>
<p>&#8216;Activities should be available to all children  &mdash;  with those who can afford it being able to pay and take part.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Officials pointed to guidance saying the scheme should &#8216;encourage those who can afford to pay to do so, while using the subsidy to make particular efforts to encourage the participation of those who are unable to pay&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The spokesman added there was no stipulation the money be ring-fenced for those on free school meals.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is down to schools to use their professional judgments in deciding who is or is not eligible for a subsidy,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;We&rsquo;re clear that many groups can be covered, including children in care, young carers and those with special educational needs  &mdash;  not necessarily limiting subsidies to pupils on free school meals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last night Trafford Council officials said activities had been restricted to children on free school meals only in the Partington area.</p>
<p>This was because of higher than average levels of children with families on state support. In other areas of Trafford running the scheme, paying parents had been able to send their children on the activities.</p>
<p>A Training and Development Agency spokesman said: &#8216;The extended services disadvantage subsidy is provided to schools specifically, and quite rightly, to help those children whose parents are less well-off and who have fewer opportunities, and a greater need than others.</p>
<p>&#8216;Our guidance to schools clearly states that any new activities  &mdash;  from breakfast clubs to summer camps  &mdash;  should be open to all pupils and should be financially sustainable, including charging for activities where appropriate.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Maybe I am not thinking like an open minded progressive but what would be wrong with allowing the kids whose parents can afford the trips pay for them and subsidising the kids whose parents cannot afford the trips? It is really punishing the kids whose parents are doing what is right by working and trying to pay their own way. BTW, I would imagine that most of the kids not going are probably White. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s good that the kids learn this lesson early on in their lives.  Let them learn that leftists hate them, their parents, and anyone else that doesn&rsquo;t rely on big brother to take care of themselves.  Let them understand that those that achieve are hated by leftists and those that fail are rewarded.  I really feel bad for the millions of normal British people who believe things like this to be madness.  </p>

		<p>On the bright side, the evil of the UK government can only last so long before something is done about it. It is now an almost naked tyranny against working and middle class whites. The Western world is truly descending into a new dark age. Heck, even the old Dark Age was not as bad as where we&rsquo;re headed. <br>
How smart can it be to reward the most useless and shiftless members of society? Those who contribute least get the most! What kind of lesson is that for kids? </p>

Is this a British variation or update of the &#8220;Blue Eyes&#8221; experiment?</p>
<p>The one thing I can&rsquo;t stand is deliberate cruelty to children. This kind of cruelty should be called what it is, child abuse. Whoever came up with this idea should be in jail.</p>

		<p>Disadvantaged groups are never helped by singling them out for perks that are at the expense of the non-disadvantaged.  It creates resentment and the idea that these people can get nowhere on their own.  I believe #3 is correct  &mdash;  sooner or later this pimple has to pop.</p>

		<p>What do you wanna bet that these elitist lefty self-loathing free-loaders have children who probably were able to see the soccer fields and meet some of ManU&rsquo;s players. What a farce! The previous poster is right. The time is running out on this insanity and it&rsquo;ll be time to pay the piper. Britain still has enough good people with sense to take back what was once theirs. If not, 3rd world Britain will be in the history books as the &#8220;Haiti of Europe&#8221; without the tropical climate. Actually the global warming theorists feel that GB will be in an ice age in about 100 years. Serves them right. Don&rsquo;t bring any libbers to the states. There are too many of them as it is. </p>

		<p>When I was raising my kids, you weren&rsquo;t allowed to send party invitations to school unless the ENTIRE CLASS would be receiving an invitation.</p>
<p>For the teachers and administrators of an entire school district to endlessly talk about an uncoming field trip in front of ALL of the children, and then ultimately REFUSE to take some of the children because they weren&rsquo;t &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; is cruel, and shows an atrocious lack of manners.  They should have refused the government money rather than have any part in such a divisive scheme.</p>
<p>No doubt, this was just a stupid, stupid mistake started by somebody at the top of the administration, BUT increasingly the middle classes are giving up on government schooling, and every screw up similar to this one just makes the process speed up.</p>

		<p>When are whites around the globe finally going to wake up? Everyone hates us and seeks to either displace us or wipe us out. Those pathetic anti-racists will seek to dispel such fears by pointing out that whites are &#8220;projecting&#8221; (One of Tim Wise&rsquo;s favorite terms), and then will proceed to cite the history of white transgressions against non-whites. Since we already have alienated the world, they are now out to kill us. For blacks, browns, and other to hate us and want to kill us is understandable. What I don&rsquo;t understand is why white elites and average whites continue to sit back and smile in the face of their displacement? If we really are so powerful and dominant, we should start using our power and acting more dominant.</p>

		<p>Here is one more great argument in favor of Home Schooling. And if the parents of these White children, who work for a living, rather than sitting around waiting for their Government check, are really fed up, well then, it is time to get together and form your own Private School; one that teaches White children about their unique Culture, and Heritage.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t these White British parents demand to know what their School taxes pay for, if not for School trips, like this. When I went to School, all I needed was a &#8220;Permission Slip&#8221; signed by one of my parents, that I could go.  </p>
<p>Think about it. No services from the School, then no payment of our School Tax money. It really boils down to that. I am not paying for something I can&rsquo;t use. Either my children benefit from what I am paying for, or I stop paying for it. </p>
<p>The money saved from not paying School Tax, could go to pay for Private School tuition, Home School text books, and teaching aids, or to begin the process of forming our own White Heritage Schools. </p>
<p>I had a video sent to me, which was quite interesting. I suggest that you look at a video called, &#8220;Cossack School&#8221; which are in the Georgian Republic, and Ukraine. These children get their instruction in Reading, Writing, Math, History, and Science, but also are immersed in their unique Culture, which they learn about, from the youngest ages. </p>
