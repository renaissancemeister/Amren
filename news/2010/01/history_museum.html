<p>But Race: Are We So Different?, the American Anthropological Association exhibit that opened recently at the Missouri History Museum, offers a platform for non-judgmental discussions on race.</p>
<p>The exhibit opened two days before the MLK holiday, and plenty of families opted to spend the day named in his honor to work towards understanding each other and building King&rsquo;s &#8220;beloved community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The traveling multi-media exhibit uses video, audio, photos, books and interactive activities to break down the racial walls that separate us from each other.</p>
<p>Upon entry, there are voices  &mdash;  of blacks, whites and other  &mdash;  bouncing around the room in every direction from television screens and speakers. It sounds as if the conversation has already begun.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Cause its Martin Luther King&rsquo;s birthday,&#8221; seven-year-old Chasen Richardson said with authority as she offered her reason for coming to the exhibit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I learned about white and black people and how they had to be separated,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;Dr. Martin Luther King was trying to make them come together, but they didn&rsquo;t allow them to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In one set of videos, people from all racial backgrounds talk about being the minority and the majority and revelations with respect to their racial experience.</p>
<p>A white man admits his own &#8220;white privilege&#8221; when he realized that he automatically helped himself to ask questions and take up time in school. An Asian man talked about being called a &#8220;banana&#8221;  &mdash;  yellow on the outside, but white on the inside  &mdash;  while growing up in Minnesota.</p>
<p>A segment called &#8220;Where Do I Sit in the Cafeteria?&#8221; explored the added frustration of bi-racial teens. Already dealing with growing pains and identity issues that automatically come with adolescence, these high-school students&rsquo; experiences were compounded by dealing with gray areas with respect to their ethnicity.</p>
<p>As guests wandered full of aim through the stations, an overwhelming number of bi-racial children had been brought by their parents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Equality and slavery</b></p>
<p>The exhibit starts at the beginning, from the ideological foundation of race to the tragic legacy of racism in the United States.</p>
<p>According to historians, the issue of race took root when European explorers met with people who didn&rsquo;t look or behave like them.</p>
<p>Racism started with American slaveholders&rsquo; attempt to justify the contradiction of declaring &#8220;all men created equal&#8221; while allowing and enforcing slavery.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A comprehensive representation of race in America is offered through the exhibit: evolution of ideas, remaining disparities, transition towards a more ethnically accepting and blended society.</p>
<p>And while the hi-tech games, videos and 3-D illustrations are striking and informative, perhaps the most effective and compelling element of the exhibit consists only of about a dozen chairs.</p>
<p>Guests are asked to fill them on Tuesdays (6 p.m.) and Saturday (2:30 p.m.) for a talking circle to make room for an open conversation on race  &mdash;  from both sides of the coin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was hoping there would be more diversity here,&#8221; Lynn Rossell said as she exited the room on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Tyronne Howze was the lone black man in the circle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt the freedom to say whatever was on my heart,&#8221; Howze said.</p>
<p>The room was filled with white faces discussing their experiences and ideas as Howze chimed in to give his perspective and answer questions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Missouri History Museum is hosting &#8220;Race: Are We So Different?&#8221; through April 4. The museum is offering several special events and activities to compliment the exhibit throughout its run. For more information, call (314) 746-4599 or visit www.mohistory.org.<br/>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that just rich?  That is what diversity and so-called healthy discussion about race really means to Marxists and nutjob wacko liberals. &#8220;You see Mr White, what you did is wrong and deeply racist and I am glad you admit it.&#8221;  It was extremely wrong for you to take up time in school from underprivileged &#8220;minorities&#8221;. See, you are a racist White male oppressor. There is no difference at all among the races, except for your evil selfishness and your unnatural white privilege. You should have thought a little bit harder how your drive to better yourself would negatively affect people of color. Those minority children might have asked for more help if it wasn&rsquo;t for your racism, and if they didn&rsquo;t it is racist of you to take advantage of their natural inclination not to learn things the way you do in your evil racist society. What you should have done was just shut your mouth and sit quietly if you needed help, better yet, you could have given your homework to Tyrone behind you, or purposely missed a few more questions on your tests so that Tyrone would not feel bad about himself having to be out of his natural habitat in your evil racist culture of which you benefited by being born into. What you should do is tear it down your evil racist society so that all the little Tyrones and Tanesha&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t forced to suffer your racism. Or just die Whitey, that would be better, you evil racist son of a b-tch.</p>

<p>I thought there were no racial differences.  Or are we all equal only when it&rsquo;s beneficial somehow for blacks and radical lefties?</p>
<p>And, after centuries, hasn&rsquo;t it been made clear that it isn&rsquo;t possible to have a meaningful dialogue on race as long as the races are integrated? Integration is the problem.  That&rsquo;s the only racial truth that should be discussed, and solutions suggested, as to how we can go to our neutral corners and live among our own kind.</p>

		<p>If white privilege exists, who gives it to us?  Privileges are given to someone via somebody else.  Blacks say &#8216;white privilege&rsquo; because they aren&rsquo;t willing to work hard, to be responsible, to plan ahead, to sacrifice, and not force to government to see that they succeed.  Blacks live in the moment and resent others who are successful.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Blacks can complain about oppression and whites can admit white privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>Within that statement is the full theory and reality of what race relations are in this country today. The rules are clear for both afrovoodoos and White American Citizens.</p>
<p>Blacks are encouraged by blacks, and financially rewarded by whites, to have high degrees of black african identity,  manifested and encouraged through complaining about oppression.</p>
<p>Whites who &#8220;passionately embrace a culture of diversity that appreciates and values individual differences&#8221; will be rewarded by being not targeted for dispossession. But they must continually prove they love the Diversity by punishing whites lower down the ladder who show any natural white identity or suspicion of multicultural Diversity or unfettered third world immigration. They must hire non whites on a regular basis and only fire whites from their jobs, never non whites.</p>
<p>Whites who embrace Diversity will not be required to &#8220;hold themselves accountable to people of color for their unearned white privilege&#8221;, at least not yet. Those whites who haven&rsquo;t publicly pledged their oaths of allegience to the Diversity will be held accountable to their lingering, unconfessed racism by being forced to admit their privilege. Those who resist will be scorned as RACIST </p>

<p>Oh, so good to hear this, Kenya my dear. Talk about race has been soooo filled with judgmentalism over the years. In fact, I was beginning to think it was downright impossible to have any discussion about race without &#8220;judgmentalism&#8221; but you have set me straight. I am so glad this exhibit is different.</p>
<p><i>According to historians, the issue of race took root when European explorers met with people who didn&rsquo;t look or behave like them.</i></p>
<p><i>Racism started with American slaveholders&rsquo; attempt to justify the contradiction of declaring &ldquo;all men created equal&rdquo; while allowing and enforcing slavery.</i></p>
<p>Oh, I see, it was those evil &#8220;European explorers&#8221; who made race an issue merely because they met people who didn&rsquo;t &#8220;look or behave like them.&#8221; And racism itself started with American slaveholders! There was no such thing as &#8220;racism&#8221; until American slavery came along! So glad you cleared that up!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wonderful to have these discussions about race without any &#8220;judgmentalism&#8221; isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t ever tear down a wall until you know why it was put up!</p>
<p>&#8221; The exhibit starts at the beginning, from the ideological foundation of race to the tragic legacy of racism in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ideological foundation?  Laugh out loud, Race is a Biological Fact!  </p>
<p>&#8220;Racism started with American slaveholders&rsquo; attempt to justify the contradiction of declaring &ldquo;all men created equal&rdquo; while allowing and enforcing slavery.&#8221;</p>
<p>No.  As the late, great Sam Francis pointed out, the term &#8216;racism&rsquo; was created by Magnus Hirschfeld in 1933.  ( <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yha54ok" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yha54ok</a> )  So &#8216;Racism&rsquo; has only existed very recently, if one chooses to believe it exists at all! </p>

		<p>Oh My Lord! &ldquo;Race: Are We So Different?&rdquo; through April 4, One of us has to go to this and explain to the people there exactly how we are so different! This museum could be a great opportunity to express ourselves. It claims to be a place which &#8220;offers a platform for non-judgmental discussions on race&#8221;, well this is our opportunity to show up and force them to truly have an honest and balanced discussion.</p>
<p>if you live in Missouri, then go to this and speak up! teach them about the many real and legitimate differences and show them how they&rsquo;ve been lied to!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Race: Are We So Different?&rdquo; through April 4</p>

		<p>Locally, the Post-Dispatch and the local TV stations have been pushing this event for a month.  You will also hear it advertised on St. Louis&rsquo;s black music radio stations, though strangely enough, never on the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; stations whose audience is mostly white. (Just like the useless &#8220;gun buyback&#8221; programs where old retired white women give the cops their late husband&rsquo;s inoperable duck hunting rifle for $50 grocery store certificate is only advertised on the black stations in town.  Wy don&rsquo;t they advertise the programs on classical music stations?  I.E. Brahms for Berettas.  Or maybe country music stations, though I would rather be a lady of the night sitting in the pews of a church and release some flatulence than advertise a gun buyback program on a country music radio station.)  If there&rsquo;s no such thing as race, then why are we advertising a &#8220;NSTAR&#8221; event in Forest Park to only one certain race on the radio? </p>
<p>A board member of the Missouri Historical Society was on the St. Louis City Public School Board several years ago, Bob Archibald.  I wonder if he thinks there&rsquo;s no such thing as race now.</p>

		<p>What kind of self-respecting white person would even go to something line this?  Nobody I know!  The only reason there&rsquo;s even such a concept of &#8220;white privilege&#8221; is so that blacks can have somebody to blame, instead of taking responsibility for their own lives and destinies.  They still want something for nothing, still want somebody else to pay their freight.</p>

		<p>If race is only a social &#8220;construct,&#8221; then it shouldn&rsquo;t matter what race you check off on a federal form, should it?  </p>
<p>Like, say you are applying for some kind of federal whatever, you check the &#8220;African American&#8221; box, even though you&rsquo;re white, it&rsquo;d make no difference to anyone, right?</p>
<p>Uh-huh.  Thought so.  </p>
<p>So, maybe the feds don&rsquo;t exactly view it as a construct, and neither do the people who call it a construct.  If they did, they wouldn&rsquo;t care what box you checked.   I mean, imagine how many &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; a company or a university could have if large numbers of whites happened to check that box on the forms? Imagine having the privilege of checking whatever box you wanted to check without encountering any bad consequences!</p>
<p>If race is a construct, and if &#8220;white&#8221; is therefore a construct, then isn&rsquo;t &#8220;white privilege&#8221; also a construct?<br/>

		<p>A new low for white guilt! A man admits his &#8220;white privilege&#8221; because he used to ask the teacher questions in school thereby preventing the black students from learning. Maybe that explains the acheivement gap.</p>
<p>In reality, the black students don&rsquo;t engage the teacher because they&rsquo;re either asleep or listening to their IPODs.</p>

		<p>I live in the St. Louis area and I am a middle-aged nerd. I go to museums, art galleries and the like. In the mid-eighties, I noticed a profound drift leftward in the main-stream cultural/art world. This is Marxist/Leftist agitprop on the taxpayers dime. I refuse to go to this nonsense and only support nonpolitical events with my personal money. The point of the exercise is mold people&rsquo;s attitudes, so as to buy into PC agenda. Unfortunately,a college education and an above average IQ won&rsquo;t guarantee that you won&rsquo;t buy into a pact of nonsense.</p>

		<p>Agree with these posts. Turtle is right, leftist/AA activist types have taken over not only university anthropology departments, but also museums. Anthropology is almost lost as a science now  &mdash;  it has degenerated into activism, and most anthropologists see nothing wrong with that. Let me recommend the work of Henry Harpending, as one of the few anthropologists who care about the truth  &mdash;  take a look at his book (with Gregory Cochran) &#8220;The 10,000 Year Explosion&#8221;.

Oh we don&rsquo;t have to think about these things.  We know them for a  act!  We know most blacks hate whites and attack us-look at the statics.  We know most blacks have black conservatives and will even attack them or kill.  This isn&rsquo;t not paranoia.  These are facts.  We see how you blacks and white liberals shut down the Amren conference because you can&rsquo;t stand to here a bunch of white men get together in interests of our race and our culture.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t go shouting down blacks or white liberals.  We don&rsquo;t go shutting down conferences when blacks or other minorities want to push their &#8216;hate whitey conference&rsquo; most of the time with tax dollars.  We aren&rsquo;t forcing blacks to let us work for them or go to their schools or forcing them to hire us. </p>
