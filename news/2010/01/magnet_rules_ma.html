<h1>Magnet Rules May Change</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Wichita Eagle, January 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Starting as soon as 2011, where your family lives or how much money you make could affect your child&rsquo;s chances of attending a Wichita magnet school.</p>
<p>School leaders and residents who are studying ways to avoid one-race schools in the wake of the end of busing for integration want to make diversity a top priority of all magnet schools.</p>
<p>This could mean most students wouldn&rsquo;t be chosen at random, as they are now. Family income or address could be factored into the selection process.</p>
<p>The magnet school application process will remain the same for next school year. The Choices Fair, where families can learn more about magnet programs, is Jan. 12 at the Century II Exhibition Hall.</p>
<p>But within the next two months, school board members could start discussing how to redefine magnet schools to attract diverse student populations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional to assign students to schools based on race. This left Wichita and school districts nationwide scrambling to dismantle strategies put in place three decades ago, when federal authorities said districts must integrate schools racially.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, schools in the predominantly minority parts of town became crowded, and schools where white students were bused, such as Mueller, lost their racial balance.</p>
<p>Twenty-one of the district&rsquo;s 80-plus schools are considered single-race in that they had 60 percent or more of students of one race last year, according to district data.</p>
<p>Magnet programs at these schools are supposed to attract a diverse student body, but since most have to accept neighborhood students first, there is limited space for students interested in the magnet program.</p>
<p>A committee of community members is considering the paradoxical task of how to maintain racial diversity in schools without using race as a factor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A draft of the policy states the purpose of magnet programs includes ensuring all students have equitable access to education, reducing &#8220;minority group isolation,&#8221; and increasing diversity of racial, ethnic and economic backgrounds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At Mueller, in the central-northeast part of Wichita, which is mostly minority and low-income, about 190 of the 540 students are magnet program students. But they weren&rsquo;t the only ones excited about the new engineering curriculum, principal Anne Clemens said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The magnet program didn&rsquo;t attract a diverse enough pool of applicants to keep Mueller from being mostly comprised of black students, though. Clemens said that as the program continues, however, interest will grow across the district.</p>
<p>&#8220;All magnet schools are hoping for that  &mdash;  all schools want to be racially balanced,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A good reflection of our district is diverse. We don&rsquo;t want it to go back to segregation.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What I think is going on here is that Wichita wants to have the right kind of &#8220;racial balance&#8221; at each school, so that no school seems to be better or worse than the others, to feed the racial equality myth (and comply with NCLB).  </p>
<p>What will happen is that there will be enough whites at all schools so that the school has good standardized test scores, and almost all the students will have good grades, but most of the blacks will have good grades thanks to grade inflation and course title inflation.  But they&rsquo;ll find a way to leave enough blacks out of the standardized tests.</p>

		<p>&#8220;the paradoxical task of how to maintain racial diversity in schools without using race as a factor&#8221;.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically saying, how can we discriminate by race and get away with it. Their methods wont change as long as non-whites = diversity, and any school and employer pledging tolerance to diversity activity discriminates against whites as &#8216;diversities&rsquo; only real benefit.</p>
<p>Discrimination against whites is the definition of diversity, at least if judge by it&rsquo;s tangible implementation.  </p>

		<p>My cousin used one of these policies to get her daughter into the best elementary school in her overcrowded district.  She rented a cheap apartment in a crime-ridden &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; neighborhood, then filed her daughter&rsquo;s application from that address.  Her daughter got preferential diversity enrollment and jumped the line into grade school due to the address.  </p>
<p>After school started, my cousin &#8220;moved back&#8221; to her home address and dumped the empty apartment.  The school didn&rsquo;t kick out kids for moving to another zip code, so her daughter was in for the rest of grade school.  A few months of ghetto apartment rent costs a lot less than 6 years of private school tuition!</p>

		<p>HOME SCHOOL YOUR KIDS.<br>
Dump the system. It has already dumped YOU!<br>
Look at it another way:<br>
As the USA, UK, etc., all busy themselves with all sorts of twisted machinations of how to super-diversify schools, against logic and practicality, this tiny 6-7% of the world&rsquo;s population (Whites) is at the bottom of a trough, while an unimaginably tall tidal wave (known as the 5.5 billion-strong Third, Brown World) plunges down on it at killing speed.<br>
The white world is a lost, insane, drooling idiot, and the brown world is pouncing. Soon it will all be over.<br>
Don&rsquo;t be among the idiotic throngs of degenerate whites who are caught unawares because they played these final games before extinction.<br>
Home school your kids; inform them of reality, not madness and fantasy. <br>
Prepare them to live in a new world where the tiny minority of whites will have to find their way to a brighter future. It may take many generations. We need  good crop of kids who will do the job, and pass down the goodness and wisdom of the white races. <br>
You don&rsquo;t want the school system. And it doesn&rsquo;t want you.</p>

		<p>The way whites have chosen to put an end to this is really quite simple and elegant.</p>
<p>We bankrupt the federal government.  Eventually, they run out of money and can no longer send money to the states to fund welfare.  Welfare will collapse in total.</p>
<p>Basically, one day soon, expect the ONLY schools that exist to be private schools you have to pay &#8220;tuition&#8221; for.  People who used to pay taxes (ie the employable) will now spend that money on things the government used to be able to pay for.  </p>
<p>There will be alot of crying about how unfair this is.  But the truth is the system by which wealth was stolen and redistributed, has collapsed under the weight of its own corruption.  It will take generations to rebuild it if it ever is.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing will be the reaction of liberal whites to this.  Basically, they are going to be told, well, if you care so much about the dead weight of society, YOU yourself do without so that they can have.</p>
<p>They are pretty free with other people&rsquo;s money but it is a proven fact that these same people RARELY give to charity themselves.  The social causes they advocate so hard for, to the detriment of everyone else, will simply disappear.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Glenn Singleton of Pacific Educational Group has become a rich man by preaching racism, hate, and scapegoating. School systems hire him for hundreds of thousands of dollars to insult and scapegoat teachers and students based on their race under the guise of &ldquo;diversity training.&rdquo; That embarrasses the school systems that hire him in high-profile legal cases. Yet foolish school superintendents continue to hire him at exorbitant rates, as the Discriminations blog notes, citing a recent story in the San Francisco Chronicle.</p>
<p>Previously, Singleton embarrassed the Seattle Schools. In 2002, they hired him to indoctrinate their students and staff about racism. As a result, they redefined racism consistent with Singleton&rsquo;s extreme and radical beliefs. The Seattle Schools defined &ldquo;individualism&rdquo; as a form of &ldquo;cultural racism,&rdquo; said that only whites can be racist, and claimed that planning ahead (&rdquo;future time orientation&rdquo;) is a white characteristic that it is racist to expect minorities to exhibit.</p>
<p>Singleton promotes the basest racial stereotypes, such as claiming that &ldquo;&rsquo;white talk&rsquo; is &lsquo;verbal, impersonal, intellectual&rsquo; and &lsquo;task-oriented,&rsquo; while &lsquo;color commentary&rsquo; is &lsquo;nonverbal, personal, emotional&rsquo; and &lsquo;process-oriented.&rsquo;&rdquo; He also blathers about &ldquo;the ubiquity of white privilege and racism,&rdquo; and depicts Asian students as being &ldquo;majority students&rdquo; just like whites because they have the temerity to succeed academically in a predominantly white society. But although he views minority culture as not being &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; and &ldquo;task-oriented,&rdquo; it is white teachers whom he blames for the underperformance of many minority students, since he claims it would be a &ldquo;racist statement&rdquo; to place any responsibility for minority underperformance on minorities themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>What is the cost of sending your daughter to school with the diversity people? </p>
<p> A story I heard a few years back goes like this. A girl from a wealthy St. Louis County family had a daughter that &#8220;hooked up&#8221; with a deseg student from St. Louis city that she went to school with.  She is now a heroin addict with multiple mixed race children from multiple fathers.  What is the dollar cost of this?</p>
<p>How much do you need to save to be willing to risk this?</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t understand why people cannot see how government schools destroy our children.  Children in these schools go through seven hours of indoctrination daily.  They learn from the beginning to compromise home taught values for the sake of getting along today.  Children are largely silent about the role playing and other things that go on.  Why?  Because they don&rsquo;t want mom or dad going to school and embarrassing them.  </p>
<p>We need private schools that teach our worldview and an increase in home schooling.</p>

		<p>Grade inflation for minority students is rampant.  I know this because I work in public school.  In the urban area I work for, every year we graduate blacks and latinos who can barely write a sentence, let alone read and understand what they&rsquo;re reading.  All teachers know this, even though most will not publicly admit it.  I have had countless conversations with teachers, one this morning, in fact, in which the teacher laments, &#8220;What do I do with my illiterate students?&#8221;  (This is high school, mind you.</p>
<p>The social justice people basically do not care about white education, because they feel that because of &#8220;white priviledge,&#8221; the whites already have more than their fair share.  Thus, whites at all levels are duty bound to uplift the minorities that will be increasingly brought around them through diverity initiatives.  That is why you see all the things going on with school integration, housing lawsuits and the like.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the social justice types who are almost all Jewish at the top and white in the middle ranks, don&rsquo;t realize they have adopted the white man&rsquo;s burden philosophy, which they would denounce as a racist justification for colonialism.</p>
<p>There is no difference in what white imperialists did back then and what white social justice people do today.  The only caveat is back then the imperialists said that the other races were racially inferior, and had to be controlled, while today the social justice types say all are genetically equal, but that many are &#8216;disadvantaged.&rsquo;  In their eyes, it is the duty of the advantaged to put aside their own progress in favor of bringing up the rest.</p>
<p>You ever wonder about the &#8216;everyone is a winner&rsquo; philosophy that now permeates any and all attempts at competition in the grade school years?  The meritocracy, as flawed as it was, was still the best promoter of progress and growth.  The equalizing notion prevalent today is a reciped for decline.  Get used to it.  We&rsquo;ve already reached the tipping point and have lost our civilization.  We&rsquo;re only in the final death throes.  Nothing left to do but take a page out of their playbook and demand equal rights for our people.  Our descendants will be an extreme minority in the world before many of us die.  </p>
<p>Imagine history classes 500 years from now when the world emerges from the dark ages: &#8220;Yes, little shaquana, there were once people who had white skin and spoke a language called English.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Why is it when whites are &#8220;isolated&#8221;, they do just fine, but when minorities (blacks esp.) are &#8220;isolated&#8221;, they fail miserably?  And how on earth is a school that is only 60% of a particular race considered a &#8220;single-race school&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Jay (#14), there won&rsquo;t BE History classes five hundred years from now, because the world will not emerge from the Dark Ages.  Ever.</p>
<p>Whites created civilization; from the Assyians who compiled the first library, to the Tocharians who introduced the loom to China: it&rsquo;s pretty-much a White creation.</p>
