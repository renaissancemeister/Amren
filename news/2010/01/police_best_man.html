<h1>Police: Best Man Pulls Gun, Robs DJ at Wedding Reception</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff McShan, KHOU-TV (Houston), Dec. 23, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Cops hear a lot of crazy stories, but this one may take the cake  &mdash;  or at least the wedding cake.</p>
<p>Houston police have been trying to track down a wedding party member who allegedly pulled a gun at the reception and started shooting.</p>
<p>It happened back on October 24th, after Nadia Clay and Terrance Simmons tied the knot.</p>
<p>Everything went off without a hitch, police said, until the best man decided to rob the DJ.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shepherd said the suspect grabbed an expensive crystal decanter full of liquor and fled.</p>
<p>Nearly two months later, police haven&rsquo;t been able to find the gun-toting best man.</p>
<p>They have wedding photos of the suspect whose name, according to the newlyweds, is Johnny Smith.</p>
<p>But the groom told investigators he barely knows the guy. He said he was a last-minute replacement for his cousin, who backed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says he met him at a basketball court playing basketball,&#8221; said HPD Detective Jeff Brieden.</p>
<p>Police don&rsquo;t believe Simmons, and neither does the victim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, they know him. They&rsquo;ve got to,&#8221; Shepherd said. &#8220;You going to let anyone be in your wedding as a best man?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Even without reading the story I knew immediately that the miscreant in this instance was black.</p>
<p>And I can readily believe that the groom didn&rsquo;t know who he was or that he&rsquo;d just met him on a basketball court.  Why is that hard to swallow?</p>

		<p>The best man at a black wedding pulls out a gun and robs the DJ, also stealing booze. The groom tells the cops he doesn&rsquo;t even know the best man because they only recently met on a basketball court.</p>
<p>If this were a movie script every Hollywood studio would reject it on the grounds that it was too racist, stereotypical and unrealistic.  </p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh reading this story. Sounds like a classic for Tyler Perry. At least no one was killed&hellip; that we know of. I wouldn&rsquo;t be suprised if the groom, maybe the bride too and &#8220;best man&#8221; had this whole thing planned in advance and split the take along time ago.</p>

		<p>If they would have charged the couple with obstruction of a police investigation, and delayed their honeymoon, maybe they would have the perp in custody by now..</p>

		<p>Much of today&rsquo;s news would be banned if it were instead created and produced as entertainment. This little skit would be an excellent modern day episode for the now infamous and banned Amos and Andy show.<br>

		<p>Certain ethnicities never cooperate to build or maintain a lawful society, they merely whine over crime they are responsible for.  Someday simmons will die from stabbing or shooting and someone who knows this lovely couple will be involved. </p>
<p>Wow.  Our future is bright.</p>

		<p>I suppose they take those &#8220;Don&rsquo;t Be A Snitch&#8221; billboard signs in their &#8216;hoods very seriously. They didn&rsquo;t know one of their best men very well&hellip;pure shenanigans, and the investigator rightly knows this, too.</p>

		<p>So this is the behavior of the &#8216;best man&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;With friends like these, who needs enemies?&#8221;</p>
<p>And of the claim that the groom had just met the &#8216;best man&rsquo; on a basketball court and he didn&rsquo;t know who he was?<br>
 <br>
It must be hard keeping a straight face while working in law enforcement sometimes. </p>
