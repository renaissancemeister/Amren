<h1><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-01-15-king-fbi-files_N.htm">King&rsquo;s FBI Files May Be Opened to Public View</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Mitchell, USA Today, January 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. Sen. John Kerry plans to introduce legislation next week that would pave the way for the release of thousands of FBI documents on the life and death of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>Kerry, D-Mass., said the bill, which failed in 2006, can pass this year in honor of King. &#8220;I want the world to know what he stood for,&#8221; Kerry said. &#8220;And I want his personal history preserved and examined by releasing all of his records.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bill calls for creating a Martin Luther King Records Collection at the National Archives that would include all government records related to King. The bill also would create a five-member independent review board that would identify and make public all documents from agencies including the FBI  &mdash;  just as a review board in 1992 made public documents related to the 1963 John F. Kennedy assassination.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is personal for someone who came of age in the civil rights movement and was inspired by Dr. King,&#8221; Kerry said. &#8220;He challenged the conscience of my generation and still moves a new generation of volunteers and activists to speak out against prejudice and suffering, wherever they might take place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pulitzer Prize-winning author Taylor Branch, whose books detail King&rsquo;s life, praised the idea of gathering all the documents on King and making them available online.</p>
<p>Second District U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat and a veteran of the civil rights movement, said he supports the release of documents  &mdash;  and believes the House and Senate will, too.</p>
<p>Alvin Sykes of Kansas City, architect of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes Act, and Hank Klibanoff, managing editor of the Cold Case Truth and Justice Project, believe Kerry&rsquo;s idea should be expanded to include the release of documents involving not only King&rsquo;s assassination, but also other racial slayings from the civil rights era.</p>

<p>Anyone who thinks the nasty truth about King will become more widely known as a result of Kerry&rsquo;s initiative is just fantasizing.  In the same way that the truth about what happened after Katrina has been suppressed/repackaged to be about black victims of white vigilantes, &#8220;Dr.&#8221; King&rsquo;s story will become distinctly Christ-like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how our new masters want it to be, and so that&rsquo;s how it will be.<br>

		<p>Do they really want ALL the files to be made public?   I can just imagine the stink if they release all the bad stuff.  I guess they can then say it&rsquo;s a racist plot to destroy MLK&rsquo;s &#8220;character&#8221;, rather than showing his true character that most of these people don&rsquo;t even know anything about.</p>

<p>I can just see what they would be getting:  Nothing worthwhile, because a lot of PC stuff would be redacted.  For example, his womanizing, his communist ties, his plagiarism, and evidence revealing his real personality.</p>

They need a review board to scour, sanitize, and put Mr. Kings historical record in context.</p>

		<p>I am surprised that Kerry is even proposing such a thing.</p>
<p>The King records normally were sealed for a time of thirty five years after the death of MLK. Those records should have been opened in 2003. But the wife of MLK convinced some judge to seal the records in perpetuity? What is that? AND HOW TOO IS IT LEGALLY POSSIBLE?? That thirty five years is the normal and accepted time for records to be sealed.</p>
<p>One hears so many stories about King. It would be nice for all the records to be available so the historians can do a proper job.</p>

<p>Bobzilla says:<br>
Yes, most likely. Which leads me to ask, is their not some type of chain-of-custody protocol involved for such documents and archives? Surely they didn&rsquo;t just throw the stuff in a box 30+ years ago and tape it up (I&rsquo;m being retorical). If an &#8220;archive&#8221; is opened up years after being &#8220;sealed&#8221; how do we know that we in fact have all the documents which were originally sealed? Does the National Archives publish their means of controlling arhives? Is there anyway to know if the King archives (or any other archives) have been tampered with? If someone has knowledge about this please share it as I&rsquo;d really like to know.</p>

		<p>Does it even matter anymore?</p>
<p>All the damage from sealing them that could been done has been done.</p>
<p>The information in King&rsquo;s FBI file may have mattered to the America of the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The old WWII generation and it&rsquo;s morality have almost completely disappeared it seems to me.</p>
<p>In a world where the Black Panthers can take weapons to the polls and the US government nor voters seem to care I don&rsquo;t it will be much different over Kings FBI files.</p>

		<p>I guess they don&rsquo;t want us doing what King said and judging by the content of character&hellip;.</p>
<p>I remember being a Detroit-area third-grader learning about King.  I was taught that he preached love, love, love, etc. </p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until around 20 years later that I realized King&rsquo;s true character, and what the civil rights movement was really all about.</p>
<p>Look, I have no problem with treating people with civility, regardless of race.  But it doesn&rsquo;t mean be ignorant of our differences.</p>

<p>Yes, senator, the world SHOULD know what he stood for and ALL of the surveillance tapes should be released including the volumes marked &#8216;obscene&rsquo; by the FBI and sealed for 35 years.  The world should also know that it &#8220;was John and Robert Kennedy (and not Hoover) who authorized the surveillance of King &mdash; because the &#8216;civil rights leader&rsquo; was associating with known communists and because he even went so far as to lie to President Kennedy to his face about having broken his links with one of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/y88xayl</p>
<p>Fortunately, King&rsquo;s misdeeds are verified by those who actually heard the FBI surveillance tapes or were present when they were recorded:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;According to Assistant FBI Director Sullivan, who had direct access to the surveillance files on King&hellip; King had embezzled or misapplied substantial amounts of money contributed to the &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; movement. King used SCLC funds to pay for liquor, and numerous prostitutes both Black and White, who were brought to his hotel rooms, often two at a time, for drunken sex parties which sometimes lasted for several days. These types of activities were the norm for King&rsquo;s speaking and organizing tours&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Pulitzer Prize-winning author Taylor Branch&hellip;.praised the idea of gathering all the documents on King and making them available online&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Great idea.  Don&rsquo;t leave anything out, especially the surveillance tape of King&rsquo;s last night:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; FBI bugs reportedly picked up 14 hours of party chatter, the clinking of glasses and the sounds of illicit sex  &mdash;  including King&rsquo;s cries of (expletives deleted).</p>
<p> Martin Luther King was having sex with three White women, one of whom he brutally beat&hellip; Much of the public information on King&rsquo;s use of church money to hire prostitutes and his beating them came from King&rsquo;s close personal friend, Rev. Ralph Abernathy in his 1989 book, &#8216;And the Walls Came Tumbling Down&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think what the arrogant Ketchup gigolo of Massachusetts thinks he can accomplish with this is to either &#8220;prove&#8221; or insinuate that a right wing conspiracy was behind the assassination of MLK.  The FBI et al actually pursued such an investigation in the late 60s and early 70s, but found it was baseless.  In reality, IMHO, if you want to find King&rsquo;s assassins, look no further than the kind of people who agreed with him.  The purpose would have been to martyr him to keep the civil rights hustle going, while he would have been a discredited middle aged preacher had he lived on, as his scandals were about to go public.  </p>

		<p>Perhaps this is an attempt to revive interest in MLK which seems to be declining even among the left-wingers.  Without White liberals organizing events and pushing him in the schools his &#8220;legacy&#8221; withers on the vine, so to speak.  Or is it a power play by White liberals nervous about the increasing power of blacks that they elevated to positions of power among their ranks?  There must be some pretty damning evidence in those files or they wouldn&rsquo;t have been sealed in the first place.  Once he&rsquo;s discredited it would be fairly easy to get Congressional support to repeal this holiday.    </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d love to see the truth about King opened for the whole world to see. DOes anyone remember the photo of Jesse Jackson on the balcont holding Kings head after the shooting.  He made sure he got some of MLK&rsquo;s blood on him to add to the drama. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken Ralph Abernathy had some comments about that incident.<br>
Didn&rsquo;t King&rsquo;s family members believe that James Earl Ray wasn&rsquo;t actually guilty of the shooting?</p>
<p> And while we&rsquo;re at it let&rsquo;s open people&rsquo;s eyes to the real Nelson Mandela who is nothing more than a murdering terrorist who never should have left prison.  </p>

		<p>I happen to see a documentary on public tv, I believe it had to do with race relations and MLK and a prominent black leader even admitted that MLK was in love with a white women before he met his black wife. I got the impression that he married a black women by default. His lust was really for white women.</p>
