<h1>Sask. Couple Survive Haiti Destruction</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Canadian Broadcasting Centre, January 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Saskatchewan couple who witnessed widespread destruction in Haiti following a massive earthquake last week have safely returned home.</p>
<p>Melvin and Melanie Brundage of Nipawin said they were at an orphanage just outside the capital of Port-au-Prince on Tuesday afternoon when the 7.0-magnitude quake hit.</p>
<p>&#8220;It kinda sounded like a big truck. The ground started shaking like a big truck drove by and then all of a sudden it just got more intense and of course it was terrifying,&#8221; Melvin said, just minutes after arriving at the Saskatoon airport.</p>
<p>The couple said they were standing on a balcony at the time of the earthquake.</p>
<p>&#8220;You kind of fall to the floor and we grabbed the kids.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I didn&rsquo;t know if I was supposed to stay on top or if I was supposed to get through the house. I didn&rsquo;t know if the house was going to fall down or not,&#8221; Melvin said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eventually it stopped and we ran outside and we just stayed outside in the compound for quite a while,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The couple has a six-year-old adopted son from Haiti, Ritchy, who was not along with them on their trip. They said they were in the country because they&rsquo;re adopting another boy.</p>
<p>However, they elected to leave Haiti  &mdash;  and their little boy  &mdash;  behind after the earthquake, saying they felt they could do more good from Canada then they could by staying there.</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided it was best to come back to Canada and just see what we could do from this end and so we could be with our son,&#8221; Melvin said through tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a very hard decision to make because we were there and we had our other son, but we had to leave him behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>The couple said the situation in the country is dire, and the orphanage they were at, which is home to about 140 children, is in need of supplies.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re cut off from supply. They only have about three days of water left, so they are trying to conserve .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we&rsquo;re just asking anyone to help out with supplies,&#8221; Melvin said.</p>
<p>The couple said they&rsquo;ll try to return to Haiti soon to bring their new son home to Canada.</p>
