		<p>This is an example of Hispanics being labeled as &#8220;White&#8221;.  Why?  Because if they&rsquo;re not identified as White then we wouldn&rsquo;t know just how low the real &#8220;White&#8221; crime really is.  In other words this is just another way of demonizing Whites and saying that &#8220;Whites&#8221; commit a higher percentage of crimes than they really do.</p>

		<p>I live in California and I can attest to the fact that there certainly are &#8220;White Hispanics&#8221;. I see them all of them time. I worked with one light-skinned woman who was born in Mexico. I asked her if she was of Spanish lineage and, to my surprise, she revealed that her father was actually German and that her mother&rsquo;s side was where the Spanish blood is. She could possible have a little bit of native Indian ancestry back on the Spanish-Mexican side. But who cares? I have a small amount in me as well as some Gypsy and I am VERY White! </p>

		<p>Nine of these guys are listed as white, yet I see no caucasians on the page. Perhaps if the CA Office of the Attorney General could accurately and honestly give a description these violent criminals would not be fugitives. But don&rsquo;t hold your breath.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s interesting. Urena, pictured above,looks like a buddy of mine I went to high school with, years ago, and he was white. What I have noticed is that it so often is the culture that makes the difference. Or to put it another way, havingt been enculturated. I was once waiting for my car to be serviced, and an elderly Mexican, also waiting for his car, started talking to me. He said his grandson was going to play baseball for a university in Texas. What he said next, utterly surprised me. He remarked that he &#8220;knows that his people do a lot of bad things and cause damage in this country.&#8221; He said this to me in perfect English, without an accent. It proved to me that though this man was from Mexico, he was totally &#8220;Americanized a long time ago.&#8221; </p>
<p>Of course, a long time ago, we did not have the insanity of the leftists, preaching multi-culturalism and supporting rights for anyone that comes to the U.S. yesterday, OVER THE AMERICAN CITIZENRY. As I&rsquo;ve said a thousand times, the left will destroy this nation domestically, as the neo-con right destroys it internationally. </p>

		<p>When hispanics commit crimes, they are categorized by the federal and state governments as &#8220;white&#8221;. When they are victims of crimes, they are categorized as &#8220;hispanic&#8221;. This is a fact. Now, how did this get started and what was the motivation of government in doing this? Spread the word amongst your white (I mean really white) friends! </p>

<p>Congress and the POTUS WILL!!! give them amnesty and citizenship. I believe many Dem representatives will do this to spite voters that are going to vote them out of office later this year.</p>

<p>Just so we are all clear, &#8220;White&#8221; is not simply a skin color, as dictated by our modern masters. There are people who have all manner of non-caucasian racial ad-mixtures in their background that would preclude them from being called &#8220;White&#8221; in the eyes of many, perhaps most here. I have known people who have one or more black&hellip;and I mean black, grandparents who look entirely white, especially to the average de-racinated person.</p>

		<p>One reason there are so many Mexicans on the list is because once they get on the list, they tend to stay on the list, as they have fled to Mexico to avoid capture.</p>

		<p>I have first cousins whose father is Puerto Rican and a few of them have been in and out of trouble with the law.  The local cops didn&rsquo;t have to know their street address, they just had to hear &#8220;[last name] house.&#8221;  I once told a cop they were my cousins and he was like, &#8220;No way, you don&rsquo;t even get into any trouble!&#8221; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always known my uncle-by-marriage to be drunk.  I&rsquo;ve seldom known him to be sober.  One time he passed out face-first on the ground and my dad pulled him up and helped him into the house.</p>

<p>   &mdash;   To anonymous above in #5</p>
<p>Out of 40 criminals I counted only 5 Whites.  That&rsquo;s about 15% of the total.  Incredibly there was only ONE that was on &#8216;America&rsquo;s Most Wanted&rsquo; - and that was the White guy in Rhode Island.  Oh by the way, &#8216;America&rsquo;s Most Wanted&rsquo; is very biased against Whites and also portrays the illusion that Whites commit a much higher percentage of the crimes than they really do.  What is that guys&rsquo; name that host&rsquo;s it - Walsh?  He&rsquo;s White.  He probably just goes along with the producers too rationalizing it away as - &#8216;Oh well, they&rsquo;re all criminals&rsquo;.  This is another problem - Whites going along with the demonization of other Whites.</p>

		<p>#5 Anonymous and #13 Awakened:  The 4 States you mention are a mix of populated/unpopulated, rural/urban and are therefore good for analysis.  As Awakened states, of the 40 most wanted criminals listed, 5 are White, 35 are Non-White.  As Whites are approximately 65% of the US population, and Non-Whites are approximately 35%, 65% of the US (Whites) are committing 15% of the crime, and 35% of the US (Non-Whites) are committing 85% of the crime!  </p>
<p>Every good citizen should ask why these important stats are not ever discussed by the media.  If we White Americans could live alone amongst ourselves, we could cut crime by approximately 85%!  So, why aren&rsquo;t Whites allowed to live alone amongst ourselves? </p>

		<p>One rotten apple will spoil the whole barrel and Hispanic cultures produce the lion&rsquo;s share of bad apples.  One can see the corrupting effect they have upon our politicians and businessmen.  </p>
<p>Can you imagine living in a country dominated by the tattooed descendants of Hispanic cannibals?  If we continue to do nothing America will soon be a country dominated by the tattooed descendants of Hispanic cannibals.  </p>
<p>Is this the cultural legacy we wish to leave our children?</p>
