<h1><a href="http://cis.org/HaitianImmigrantFactSheet">Fact Sheet on Haitian Immigrants in the United States</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steven A. Camarota, Center for Immigration Studies, January 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Since the terrible tragedy in Haiti, many have sought information about the Haitian community in the United States. Below are some basic socio-demographic statistics:</p>
<p>* The last Census Bureau data (2008) indicates there are 546,000 Haitian immigrants in the United States. That is up from 408,000 in 2000 and 218,000 in 1990.</p>
<p>* Of the 546,000 foreign-born Haitians in the United States, 48 percent are naturalized U.S. citizens; this compares to 43 percent for the overall foreign-born population.</p>
<p>* The top states of Haitian immigrant settlement are Florida (251,963; 46%), New York (135,836; 25%) New Jersey (43,316; 8%), Massachusetts (36,779; 7%), Georgia (13,287; 2%), and Maryland (11,266; 2%).</p>
<p>* Our best estimate is that there are 75,000 to 125,000 illegal Haitian immigrants in the country. In 2000, the INS estimated there were 76,000 illegal Haitian immigrants.</p>
<p>* When it extended Temporary Protected Status to Haitians, the Department of Homeland Security estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people could be eligible. While most are illegal immigrants, this estimate also includes those on temporary visas such as tourists, foreign students, and guest workers who will not have to go home.</p>
<p>* Between 2000 and 2008, 183,188 Haitians were given green cards (permanent residence). These figures do not include those who entered on a long-term, temporary basis such as guest workers and foreign students nor does it include short term visitors like tourists. Of those given permanent residence, 135,913 (74 percent) were admitted under family-based immigration.</p>
<p>* There are 310,000 U.S.-born Americans who have at least one parent born in Haiti.</p>
<p>* Of Haitian immigrants (ages 25 to 65) 22 percent have not graduated from high school and 18 percent have a college degree. This compares to 9 percent and 30 percent, respectively, for native-born Americans.</p>
<p>* The share of Haitian immigrants and their young children (under 18) living in poverty is 20 percent. For native-born Americans and their young children it is 11.6 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* Of households headed by Haitian immigrants 46 percent use at least one major welfare program. For households headed by native-born Americans it is 20 percent.</p>

<p>546,000 Haitian immigrants in the entire U.S?</p>
<p>How then does the Census Bureau explain these NYC figures:</p>
<p>[There are] &hellip; &#8220;more than 400,000 Haitian (and over 600,000 Dominican immigrants) in New York City.&#8221;<br>

		<p>All I can say is that having dealt with Haitians in my work, they see absolutely no stigma in taking all forms of public assistance to the maximum allowed with no compunction because to them, the government &#8220;owes us.&#8221;</p>

<p>What good does it do to advertise education figures when the listed figures reflect either a Haitian education, which is worth almost zero, or they reflect affifrmitive action certificates?</p>
<p>And, before the point is raised, &#8220;NO!&#8221; the black Haitians do not do any better than the average US black.  Both get the same kind of nonsensical privileges in education, as they do in everything else.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t immigrant advocates always assure us immigrants aren&rsquo;t on welfare programs?<br>

		<p>&rdquo; Of Haitian immigrants (ages 25 to 65) 22 percent have not graduated from high school and 18 percent have a college degree. This compares to 9 percent and 30 percent, respectively, for native-born Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When using the figure(s) for &#8220;native-born Americans&#8221;, don&rsquo;t forget they are including BLACK people born in the U.S.  If you compare Haitian immigrant achievement in education with native-born WHITE Americans, the gap, assuredly, would be exponentially larger.</p>
<p>&#8220;The share of Haitian immigrants and their young children (under 18) living in poverty is 20 percent. For native-born Americans and their young children it is 11.6 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, factor out native-born Black Americans&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

		<p>I have an idea.  Since the Haitians are direct descendants from Africa, how come we don&rsquo;t send them back to Africa.  How come they have to come to the U.S.?</p>

		<p>Any social statistics that do not sort people by race are fraudulent.  The article says that 20 % of native-born Americans use at least one major welfare program, compared to 46 % of Haitians.  The relevant comparison should be with Whites only, the host population.  Including diverse parasites in the &#8220;native-born American&#8221; category makes the Haitians seem not quite as bad in as they really are, in comparison.  That, of course, is exactly why the msm lumps us all together.  </p>

		<p>One would have thought that this country already has enough dysfunctional, criminally inclined, and generally unproductive citizens of African descent without importing more.  And those additional blacks have a nearly two hundred-year history of independence and self-rule without the interference of the evil white man, time enough to have created a prosperous and vibrant society within their tropical paradise.</p>
<p>Depressingly, what they have created is their own little piece of Darkest Africa, right off our coast.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep them there.</p>

		<p>Great!  More blacks to add to the 12% we already have.  Gee, just can&rsquo;t get enough of a group of uncivilized, complaining, hateful, racists that hate the very people that are stupid to help them out since the 1960s!</p>

<p>I wonder WHY they have to leave Haiti at all to go ANYWHERE! the country is still there and no one who has been there could tell anything was amiss&hellip;same ol garbage and worthless people in and on the streets and the usual infrastructure decay. This may be the best thing to happen to Haiti for some time. They get new roads, buildings, infrastructure, ALL of their criminals will be gone as will all of those troublesome &#8220;orphans&#8221; and the welfare and freebies will be in perpetuity from the U.S. TAXPAYING SLAVES!</p>
