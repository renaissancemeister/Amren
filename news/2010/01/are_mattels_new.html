			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ann Zimmerman, Wall Street Journal, December 3, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With so few black dolls on toy-store shelves, many black parents had high hopes when toy powerhouse Mattel Inc. released So in Style, its first line of black dolls with wider noses, fuller lips, sharper cheekbones and a variety of skin shades.</p>
<p>Now, despite the company&rsquo;s efforts to solicit input from a group of high-profile black women, including Cookie Johnson, wife of former basketball star Magic Johnson, some parents are saying the dolls aren&rsquo;t black enough. They complain that five of the six dolls feature fine-textured, waist-length hair; half of them have blue or green eyes.</p>
<p>Moreover, all have the freakishly skinny body of a Barbie (something that irks some white parents as well).</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was unfortunate that once again we&rsquo;re given a doll with hair that is so unlike the vast majority of black women,&#8221; says Cheryl Nelson-Grimes, the mother of a 7-year-old girl and a resident of Queens, N.Y. &#8220;I feel very strongly that I want my daughter to love herself for who she is and not believe that using a hot comb or straightening her hair is the only way to be beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The criticism over Mattel&rsquo;s new black fashion dolls underscores how difficult it is for large commercial companies to please a widely diverse black community with a single image or two depicting young African-Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they had given the dolls short, kinky hair or an Afro, people might have complained that it was too Afro-centric,&#8221; says Nicole Coles, a 40-year-old mother from Temecula, Calif. &#8220;We&rsquo;re so hard and picky.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mattel nonetheless has taken the comments to heart and plans to expand the line in the fall of 2010 to include a doll with more of an Afro hairstyle.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t Mattel&rsquo;s first foray into creating black dolls. The El Segundo, Calif.-based toy maker first introduced a black doll in 1967, when it painted Barbie&rsquo;s cousin Francie brown. Two years later, Barbie got a black friend named Christie. A black Barbie came along in 1980, but her features were almost identical to those of her white counterpart.</p>
<p>The expensive line of American Girl dolls, also owned by Mattel, features a black doll named Addy Walker, a runaway slave whose story is set during the Civil War. But with a price tag of $95, it is out of reach for a lot of families.</p>
<p>Other toy lines, including the popular Polly Pocket miniatures, also made by Mattel, include only a few black dolls. &#8220;Polly Pocket only has one or two brown dolls, and my daughters fight over them,&#8221; says Mary Broussard-Harmon, a mother of three girls from Corona, Calif.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>J. Lorand Matory, chairman of the Department of African and African American studies at Duke University, says that there is a history of self-hatred in the African diaspora that stems from the value attached to European hair, features and skin color. &#8220;Mattel didn&rsquo;t send the message, but they are reinforcing it,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;These dolls are a much better representation than what has been in the marketplace,&#8221; says Mattel spokeswoman Michelle Chidoni. &#8220;But we hear the argument.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stephanie Archer thinks the criticism is much ado about nothing. A chapter vice president of Mocha Moms, Ms. Archer took her daughter Sydney, age 6, to a tea party in Manhattan, where Mattel unveiled the new dolls in late September.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mattel did a good job getting the facial features right,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The dolls are beautiful, and the event made our daughters feel beautiful, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sydney&rsquo;s hair is curly, rather than kinky,&#8221; adds Ms. Archer, who lives in Queens. &#8220;She knows her hair texture is different than the dolls&rsquo;, and that&rsquo;s OK. We have to give our kids more credit.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to more Afro-centric dolls, Mattel will be coming out with a black male So in Style doll named Darren. That will please Claire Jefferson-Glipa, a Corona, Calif., mother of a 6-year-old girl and 3-year-old son.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think finding black dolls for girls is hard,&#8221; she says, &#8220;try finding black action figures or super heroes.&#8221;<br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe any white parents are irked by the &#8216;freakishly skinny body on Barbie&rsquo;. I do believe that some women groups have made Barbie figure proportions an issue linked to young girls self-esteem (which I have always believed is absurd).</p>
<p>AGAIN we see blacks complaining about an issue they SAY they believe is important AND profitable. Why then are they giving the idea to a &#8216;white&rsquo; corporation instead of making the black dolls they believe young black girls need and want?</p>
<p>The answer is threefold. There is no market for such dolls. There is no profit in such dolls. Most blacks lack the entrepreneurial drive.   </p>

<p>Well, here we go with another Top 10 list of  black action or super heroes:</p>
<p>1.) Despotic Darren, the dictator of all former African colonies, he got rid of &ldquo;whitey&rdquo; and now he wants to get rid of you;</p>
<p>2.) Magnificent Malik, Despotic Darren&rsquo;s chief of the secret police, if Despotic Darren&rsquo;s famines don&rsquo;t get you, Magnificent Malik&rsquo;s goons will;</p>
<p>3.) President Barrack Obama, doing to the USA slowly what Magnificent Malik and Despotic Darren do in Africa, with just a touch of &ldquo;elegance;&rdquo; </p>
<p>4.) Affirmative Action Hero, the sum total of a level playing field paved with white &ldquo;guilt,&rdquo; and as his &ldquo;opportunities&rdquo; grow so does he;</p>
<p>5.) Martin the King, he provides the &ldquo;opportunities&rdquo; so that Affirmative Action Hero can grow, while mystically sprinkling his magic white &ldquo;guilt&rdquo; dust of &ldquo;equality,&rdquo; </p>
<p>6.) Rapping Rapist Ra&rsquo;Mando, the lost &ldquo;Pharaoh&rdquo; that Barbie both hides from and secretly craves;</p>
<p>7.) Professor Tom, this Afro-centrist with a fully &ldquo;earned&rdquo; PhD can really spin you a yarn;</p>
<p>8.) Ghetto Grady, he is only &ldquo;shady&rdquo; at night;</p>
<p>9.) Pimp Pong, he gets what&rsquo;s left of Barbie and sells it on the turf of  Ghetto Grady;</p>
<p>10.) And Convicted &ldquo;Wrongly&rdquo; Congo De&rsquo; Mondo, he has Ken all to himself in cellblock 8 and calls him &ldquo;Barbie Boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Recently, on my way home late in the evening in midtown Manhattan, I stopped in a clean respectable restaurant for a takeout dinner. This is a place that many lovely out of town visitors stop to eat during the Christmas season. After it had been prepared I saw that the guy (almost seems too nice a word) who&rsquo;d put it together was wearing: black shirt, black pants and white undershorts. How did I know they were white? Because the pants were below his behind and the shirt was above it. Sometimes this style looks even more stupid, disgusting, hideous and inappropriate than others and this was definitely one of those times. I was going to cancel my order, but I was hungry and of course knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be of any significance anyway, but I have to say, it made me sick.<br>
Point - I hope they dress the male doll exactly, exactly, exactly like this.</p>

&ldquo;If you think finding black dolls for girls is hard,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;try finding black action figures or super heroes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MY RESPONSE:<br>
The reason it is so hard is because In The Real World there really are no black super heroes.<br>
In real life blacks won&rsquo;t even pick up after themselves after a hurricane, they wait for Dim Witted Mr Whitey to come along and do it all for them (for free of course) as they tell the world how bad Mr Whitey has been to them.<br>

		<p>Nothing is ever simple with black people. What I mean is that something silly like a doll is never just a &#8220;doll&#8221;. Everything has to serve some kind of propaganda purpose with them like raising &#8220;self-esteem&#8221; or &#8220;empowerment&#8221;. That&rsquo;s why things are never &#8220;black&#8221; enough.</p>

		<p>To my knowledge, there aren&rsquo;t any mainstream Asian dolls made by Mattel and there aren&rsquo;t any Asian quarterbacks in the NFL.  </p>
<p>Combine this with the fact that there isn&rsquo;t likely a wealth of Asian magazines, television shows, movie headliners, etc., and we should be seeing Japanese, Korean and Chinese people in Western nations committing similar numbers of rapes, murders, assaults and robberies; much like the Black population(s) in these countries where there is such &#8216;under-representation&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>I am in Germany right now and just last week was in an ice cream parlor. A lovely little German girl almost bumped into me, and I leaned down to talk to her. She was a sweetheart and very shy. Fuzzy feelings aside, one my way out I tried to hide my disgust as I noticed her parents had evidently bought her a black baby doll, that was abondend in her stroller. Germany did not even participate in the slave trade and they still want their daughters to hate their natural white skin, because it seems the PC thing to do. Not to worry, Germany, especially the less-populated Southwestern state, is getting darker with all the African immigrants. </p>
<p>My sons and daughters will never worship black skin, nor hate their own white skin. I am one of the ever-decreasing group of white women not sucked into the date-a-black-man scheme. It&rsquo;s hard to find men who stick up for us too, and I can&rsquo;t blame them because of the PC atmosphere. But I beseech you, men will have to stand up first. It&rsquo;s in your nature to be proud warriors, and women fall victim to the extreme sensitivity of PC. The road will not be easy, but I and others like me are willing to give up some of those &#8220;rights&#8221; propogated by extreme-feminists to stand behind warriors. We are lost without you.  </p>

		<p>Whites have been made to be so hypersensitive concerning depictions of blacks that it&rsquo;s absolutely no wonder that black dolls look like white dolls with darker skin.  If a manufacturer were to make dolls with kinky hair, wide noses, and large lips, someone like Sharpton would cry foul. <br>
For thousands of years, these facial attributes have been generally seen as unattractive and have been used mainly as lampoon stereotypes.  Of course, any black manufacturer is free to produce them and remain, for the most part, free from criticism.  </p>

		<p>1) Blacks seem to define themselves by what there are not, they cannot agree on what they are.  But when non-blacks define what they see and experience as black it is derisively call stereotyping.  <br>
2) In a global economy where industry is aggressively searching for profits, why haven&rsquo;t more black dolls been marketed?  Could the Chinese be that racist?  Even if they are, the Chinese business ethic of chasing opportunity would include dolls of color, assuming demand.  And where are the African manufacturers?  Are there any?  And if not, why not as one would think they have a ready local market.  <br>
3) If a non-black makes money manufacturing and selling black dolls then the dolls are deemed not the right type.  If a black makes no attempt at black dolls that&rsquo;s unfair, and if they try and fail that is proof of an unjust world.  </p>

<p>Ok, this seems like a pretty easy fix to me. </p>
<p>First, when making the doll&rsquo;s head, add a very thin layer of coarse, kinky hair. Then make the long, fine hair a separate piece, which fastens to the coarse hair with a small bit of Velcro. Thus, the doll functionally has a weave. </p>
<p>Next, give the doll dull brown eyes, and include small, colored plastic covers to change the eye colors to whatever they choose, a la colored contacts.</p>
<p>This way, little black girls can practice on their dolls doing the things black women do in real life to look more like [naturally beautiful] white women!</p>

		<p>The way I see it is probably too simplistic but here goes anyway. A totally frustrating search of african manufacturers of ethnic dolls (that&rsquo;s africa, as in sub-Saharan) located only Chinese merchandise imported into the dark continent but &#8216;black african&rsquo; revealed quite a selection of voodoo stuff but no actual dolls for children. So I trawled various doll collector sites and came up with an entire boxed set as pictured below. However, as others have also commented, if blacks demand black dolls then there must be some black HBCU graduates who can approach black backers and black bankers and so fill this niche market, always assuming there is a commercially viable demand, otherwise it&rsquo;s a no-no and I, for one, would not invest in anything so crass.<br>

		<p>Here in the UK (I don&rsquo;t know about elsewhere) there have, until fairly recently, always been black dolls.  They are called Golliwogs, but they have now been deemed &#8220;racist&#8221;.  At least one person has been prosecuted for selling them.  </p>

<p>In the harsh, unforgiving climate of the north, the one in which Whites evolved, females as well as males had to learn survival tactics  &mdash;  if the male were killed, and the female were dependent, she and her children would die.</p>
<p>We are entering a new, hostile, anti-White era and are becoming a hated minority in the country we created.  That there is a war on Whites is not in dispute.  If (some say when) the economy collapses, and we enter an era of anarchy and targeted violence against Whites, it&rsquo;s going to take everything we have to survive.</p>
<p>Do not teach your White female children to be helpless, lost, to stand behind a man, to be dependent, to not have the ability to support or defend themselves and their children.  Teach them to handle fire arms, to handle finances, to protect themselves and their children against assault, rape and murder.  </p>
<p>I, as a female, learned from my father to dig post holes, handle a rifle, put up dry wall, change the oil and tires on a car, drive a stick shift, cut down trees and mind my finances.  I was taught to support and defend myself and my children, lessons I believe are valuable for all females, what with a divorce rate at 50%, an anti-White government and an economy on the verge of imploding.  I am forever grateful for these lessons, they have done me well and are things I am teaching my own daughter.</p>
<p>In the near future, as Whites increasingly become a hated minority, and as it was in the past, protecting, defending and providing for yourself and your children may be a matter of survival.  Our survival in the harsh north also gave us an ability to plan and strategize for the future  &mdash;  use it.</p>
<p>It is in our DNA.</p>
<p>We Whites didn&rsquo;t survive ice ages, famines, hostile invasions, oppressive governments, the plague and any other obstacle thrown in our path by being wimps.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
