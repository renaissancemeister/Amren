<h1>Mexican Cartel Skins Rival&rsquo;s Face, Stitches It on Soccer Ball</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, January 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The body of 36-year-old Hugo Hernandez was left on the streets of Los Mochis in seven pieces as a chilling threat to members of the Juarez drug cartel. A note read: &#8220;Happy New Year, because this will be your last.&#8221;</p>
<p>To drive home the point, the assailants skinned Hernandez&rsquo;s face and stitched it onto a soccer ball.</p>
<p>The gruesome find, confirmed Friday by Sinaloa state prosecutors, represents a new level of brutality in Mexico&rsquo;s drug war, in which torture and beheadings are almost daily occurrences.</p>
<p>Hernandez was taken to Sinaloa after being kidnapped Jan. 2 in neighboring Sonora state, in an area known for marijuana growing, said Martin Robles, a spokesman for Sinaloa prosecutors. The motive for his abduction was unclear.</p>
<p>His torso was found in a plastic container in one location; elsewhere another box contained his arms, legs and skull, Robles said. Hernandez&rsquo;s face, sewn onto a football, was left in a plastic bag near City Hall.</p>
<p>More than 15,000 people have been killed since President Felipe Calderon launched a crackdown on cartels three years ago. While the border cities of Ciudad Juarez and Tijuana have seen much of the violence, Sinaloa state is Mexico&rsquo;s drug-smuggling heartland and is the birthplace of the leadership of four of the six major cartels.</p>
<p>Often, victims are tortured and mutilated, in an attempt to intimidate rivals, officials and others who might represent a threat to the cartels.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the northern city of Saltillo, a major regional newspaper announced it would stop covering drug violence altogether after the body of a reporter was found Friday outside a motel with a threatening message. Valentin Valdes had recently written about the arrests of suspected drug traffickers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many Mexican news media have stopped covering anything that might be associated with drugs, or limit themselves to reporting on government news releases. At least 17 journalists have been killed in Mexico since 1992 in direct reprisal for stories, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.</p>

		<p>If things continue in the same direction, in the next couple of decades there will be a tipping point in the US where enough latino politicians take power and enough latinos will be in the police force that latino corruption and violence will bubble over and dominate the Southwest US, transforming the society/culture of the region. The Southwest US and Mexico will become indistinguishable, and equally unlivable. </p>

		<p>&#8220;More than 15,000 people have been killed since President Felipe Calderon launched a crackdown on cartels three years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those casualty figures are close to the number of men we lost in the same time period in the Vietnam war, and almost 4 times larger than what we lost in Iraq in the first three years.</p>
<p>If these cartels ever settle their differences and unite as one, Mexico is going to be a full-fledged narco-state.</p>
<p>What these US politicians better start worrying about before they waste more time on amnesty is securing the border, because drug money and the influence it buys has already corrupted much of the Southwest US and a bit of it has pockets of control within the heartland&hellip;&hellip;and the gangs and influences there are growing steadily.</p>
<p>The threat of drug cartels, economic collapse still a very real possibly, and wonderful diversity that keeps us on the brink 24/7, all converge at this point in time to make the odds of our remaining intact for the next presidential election very slim.</p>

		<p>June is right, and now that the Democrats have a majority in both houses and the man who was formerly the most left wing Democratic senator is President, it&rsquo;s going to be the fight of our lives.  It was hard enough when George W. Bush and a number of clueless Republicans were pushing for amnesty.  Only a congress with many more sensible Republicans saved us from that disaster.</p>

		<p>Just a thought.  The pre-Spanish Mexicans were Mayans, Aztecs and other tribes.  They had a very brutal culture based on torture and human sacrifice.  Have you seen some of the bizarre are from those times?  Death, skulls, killing&hellip;</p>
<p>The spanish came in and treated the Indians just as badly AS they treated each other, so violence was reinforced by violence.  Mexico became independent, but it never advanced because the colonizers and later mestizos were not connected to northern and western European traditions.  (Spain was always a violent place!)</p>
<p>The Mexican drug gangs are not doing something that is unusual for their cultural background.  It&rsquo;s not like their parents were some nice little churchgoing peasants.  Violence is part of the warrior ethos of mesoamerican civilization.</p>
<p>Mexican gangs routinely use Aztec symbols and skulls for example, and killing your enemies, even brutally, has a long history in that cultural tradition.  As long as they are doing it to each other, most non-latinos don&rsquo;t notice too much.</p>
<p>The problem is that there will come a day when the mexican gangs in the u.s. will suddenly realize that gringos are easy prey- then you will start to see mass shootings and beheadings in a white neighborhood near you.  God help us all!</p>

		<p>Who cares what mexicans do to each other?  This is only a serious problem because we refuse to close the border and kick out the mestizos already living in the US.</p>
<p>If we would just do that, them killing each other non-stop would be a non-issue.</p>
