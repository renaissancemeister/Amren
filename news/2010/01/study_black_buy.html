			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Denise Stewart, BlackAmericaWeb.com, January 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The percentage of blacks in America is growing, and so is the amount of money blacks have available to spend on goods and services, according to a study released this week.</p>
<p>The &#8220;African-Americans Revealed&#8221; study, based on a BET survey of 80,000 black consumers over 18 months, showed a 10 percent increase in America&rsquo;s black population between 2000 and 2008 and 55 percent increase in black buying power over the same period.</p>
<p>According to the survey, black buying power is estimated now at about $913 billion and is projected to increase to $1.2 trillion by 2013.</p>
<p>A similar study released in November by the Selig Center at the University of Georgia estimated that black buying power would be about $1.1 trillion by 2014, with current spending power for blacks at about $910 billion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Until the recession set in about a year and a half ago, blacks in America had been experiencing an upturn in wages and earnings, Watkins [Boyce Watkins, a Syracuse University business professor] told BlackAmericaWeb.com.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, when African-Americans make money, we spend it. We don&rsquo;t use it to invest or produce,&#8221; Watkins told BlackAmericaweb.com. &#8220;When we get our tax refund, we go straight to the store.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks spend a large part of their disposable income  &mdash;  $39 billion  &mdash;  on computers, cell phones and other electronics, the survey showed. That&rsquo;s about 31 percent of the available disposable income.</p>
<p>The survey also showed that blacks spend more time each week online than they do watching television.</p>
<p>According to the study, blacks spend about 18 hours each week online, compared with 15 hours watching television.</p>
<p>&#8220;African Americans Revealed&#8221; predicted there will be 42 million blacks in the United States, which would be a 13.4 percent increase over the 2000 Census. The total population growth for the nation in the upcoming Census is projected to be 9.8 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Of the many diverse supporting forces, one of the most important is the increasing number of blacks who are starting and expanding their own businesses,&#8221; [University of] Georgia researchers said.</p>
<p>The fact that blacks are getting more education and better access to higher salaries also is boosting buying power. The percentage of blacks who have completed high school or college increased has increased from 66.2 percent in 1990 to 83 percent in 2008, according to Census data cited in the report from the Selig Center.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m betting the black buying power, along with the rest of the country, is going to go south big time before 2013 gets here.</p>
<p>Increasing buying power is the real reason for AA, in addition to an overall increase in power.  </p>
<p>If the country somehow escaped breakup, there&rsquo;s no indication a false stimulus like AA can sustain itself.  In fact, history tells us it cannot.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a moot point anyway, because by 2013 increasing purchasing power will take a back seat to trying to survive in a world of depression and all the attendent chaos involved.  Apparently they haven&rsquo;t noticed the empire is starting to come apart in a big way.</p>

		<p>Alot is made over the lack of impulse control blacks have with regard to spending.</p>
<p>Although that is undeniably true, there is another side to this coin.</p>
<p>When you have to work and sweat for the money you make, you value it and don&rsquo;t spend it foolishly.  Much if not MOST of the money blacks have was never earned but simply given to them after it was stolen from the whites who did earn it.  Why should they value it or associate getting it with hard work?  Why should they be careful with it?</p>
<p>Think about it.  Alot of ink has been used to debate genetics vs socialization with regard to black social pathology. But what is ignored is the fact that BOTH causes exist.  Further, the same changes that would undo bad socialization, as a factor in this, also minimize the impact of genetics.  I would go further to say that being insistent with regard to the latter, can and will result in them compensating for the former.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a different way of saying that socialism isn&rsquo;t just bad for the whites that are robbed from, it&rsquo;s bad for the blacks that are given what was taken from whites.  Whites aren&rsquo;t being generous when they allow this to happen.  They are allowing blacks to engage in self-destruction&hellip;&hellip;and take whites along with them for the ride.</p>

		<p>Blacks spend more time online than they do watching TV?  I thought there was a personal computer gap.  Perhaps they go online at &#8220;work&#8221;, since watching TV on the job is too much to take, even from an affirmative action hire.</p>

		<p>How much of that buying power was due to easy credit?  Sounds to me like more baloney.  The racial and economic house of cards is falling collpasing.</p>

		<p>Most of the increased buying power of blacks comes from recycling their government paychecks into the retail economy. Fully a quarter of all Federal employees are black. And clearly the 700 billion dollar stimulus has been heavily directed at borrowing money from the white kids of today to pay for blacks&rsquo; wide screen t.v.s today so they can watch BET.</p>

		<p>All that money is what has been stolen from White people, wealth created of or our hard work and intelligence (and of our ancestor&rsquo;s) which should have been passed on to our children. Without this stolen wealth, blacks in the U.S.A would have been slightly better off than the Haitians.</p>

		<p>Many blacks spend a lot of time online playing games and gambling.  And, if they don&rsquo;t have a computer, they use every free moment at work if there are computers there, or they flock to libraries and tie up the ones there.  I live near a small city that&rsquo;s about 4% black, and the rural county in which I reside has about 1%.  Until several months ago, when the libraries began issuing cards for timed computer use that could  be used only by library-card-carrying patrons, blacks (mostly young men) were so commonly seen at the computers that one would have thought he/she were in Atlanta!  Apparently, they were traveling from miles around, to tiny library branches, to find not-in-use computers.  </p>

		<p>Spending money has never been a problem for anyone or any race, it&rsquo;s the controlling of spending when the individual or country doesn&rsquo;t have it. How are blacks at saving? If we look to BO for the answer, I&rsquo;d say they had not a clue as to what saving takes.<br>

		<p>Note that the period of the study is 2000-08, which precisely tracks the credit bubble.  At government&rsquo;s encouragement and often insistence, banks poured easy money into minority hands in the form of subprime mortgages, including second mortgages and credit-lines, high-interest credit cards and an endless supply of student loans.  Well, that house of cards has collapsed, and with it the bottomless piggy banks that so many blacks thought they had during this decade.  </p>

<p>Most people in the soft sciences don&rsquo;t have any understanding of the basics of the scientific method, and people that work for BET probably even less so. Given the large 80,000 person sample size you can assume the study was most likely just an internet questionnaire that grossly skewed the results towards tech savvy blacks. </p>
<p>More importantly it is generally understood that research based on voluntarily provided polling data is of the flimsiest reliability. Most people also will not admit to watching 8 or 10 hours of TV a day which makes you sound unintelligent, boring and lazy. Most people want to downplay unflattering information about themselves.</p>
<p>Nielsen research which cannot be easily fudged indicates that the average household in the US watches 8 hours of TV a day, or 56 a week and blacks universally score the highest on the amount of TV watched. 15 hours a day would probably be more accurate than this supposed figure of 15 hours per week.</p>

<p>Watching TV at work is too much? Don&rsquo;t kid yourself.  Certainly not in the Civil Service office where I work! It is very common for people to bring their TV&rsquo;s to work and to have them on their desks. And nothing can be done about it either, because even the bosses are watching their own TV&rsquo;s too.</p>

		<p>&#8220;when African Americans make money they spend it.&#8221; No kidding. On absolute junk, like chrome spinners, stereos on steroids, and $300 jeans. Which is why they have no money in savings to fall back on if they&rsquo;re become unemployed, and many of them are an immediate drain on society. They don&rsquo;t spend their money on frivolous nonsense such as car, health or life insurance; thus require free social and medical services paid by the majority white tax payers.  Between use of free services, judicial and incarceration costs, among others, the amount they take away is surely higher than the amount they contribute.</p>

		<p>I bet the increasing black buying power is coming from AA jobs, forcing the government to give them grants (free money via whites), or tapping into white guilt to make money.  Who cares if blacks make all this money?  They blow it on rims, women, and other &#8216;gangsta&rsquo; stuff.</p>

		<p>In many urban areas it&rsquo;s not uncommon to see satellite dishes atop Section 8 government housing.  And I&rsquo;d venture to say at least 50% of the population below the poverty line (and in need of government-funded health care) are equipped with cell phones, ipods and flatscreens. </p>
