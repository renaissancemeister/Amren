<h1>Dallas Business Man, Helping at Haiti Hospital, Struggles to Maintain Order, Questions His Actions</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nancy Visser, Dallas Morning News, January 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mike Roberts, a Dallas businessman who donated the use of his company plane to take medical workers and supplies to Haiti, has been helping manage operations at a community hospital where volunteer teams are treating people. He was invited to help out when the staff learned that he&rsquo;s a CEO. He went to Haiti to try to help the children but said he now finds himself in a &#8220;nightmare situation.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}<blockquote>Today was a tough. I came here hoping to be able to reach out and help the Haitian people. Instead I inherited a nightmare situation that no one was willing to do anything to change it.</p>
<p>We have no security, no armed guards, no other Americans except doctors and nurses to handle the situation we are in. This old hospital is completely surrounded by thousands of Haitians who have no shelter, food or water. The hospital is the only sustaining entity with supplies arriving regularly and therefore the main focus of survival for these people. They are flooding the hospital attempting to get food and water and are preventing access to those who are in desperate need of receiving medical attention.</p>
<p>Healthy people are acting sick and clogging the system in order to gain access. We even had a guy today come through the system just to charge his cell phone on one of the only working outlets. We have had to create several outside triage tents in order to attempt to screen out those who are really needing help.</p>
<p>{snip} I spent my day throwing out those who didn&rsquo;t belong only to have them scream or beg me the rest of the day to let them in. The same thing was going on with the visitors. It was virtually impossible to handle this right. People were telling us they had family inside only to get in to steal supplies. {snip}</p>
<p>The pinnacle of the stress came when a shipment of 600 water bags showed up outside the front gate. Each bag contained about 30 smaller 12oz bags of water. The truck could only get 25 yds from the gate and before we knew it we were swarmed and blocked from getting back into the building. I was screaming at the top of my lungs for them to get back. I literally was shoving people back and throwing kids off the back of the truck. I am lucky the crowd didn&rsquo;t fight back. If they would have turned on me there was no way I would have made it out of there alive. We ended up losing about a third of the water which was intended for the patients and they desperately needed every bit of it.</p>
<p>I came here to love on these people. I wanted to encourage them and build them up. Instead I have had to scream at them. Shove them. Ignore their cries for help. Choose whether or not to believe them. I can tell you that it sure doesn&rsquo;t feel very Christ like. I wonder how he would have done it? I feel so conflicted. I know that this had to be done in order for the doctors to be able to do what they came here for and also to protect those who were in the hospital but I am just sick to my stomach at the role I have had to play in this. I am torn because I came here to help the children but I just can&rsquo;t leave the rest of these guys alone with no one to handle the security issues.</p>

		<p>How old is this guy? He&rsquo;s smart enough to have his own plane, but still believes fairy tales about racial harmony. Did he ever look down while flying over the projects? </p>
<p>Sheesh, here I am poor, in debt, and stuck in the daily grind and even I know not to go down to Haiti for useless do-gooder work. They will never be grateful for your help, so why bother? When S.F. had its earthquake in 1906 I don&rsquo;t recall Haitians showing up to help. </p>

		<p>Odd.  I don&rsquo;t remember reports like this after the many earthquakes and tsunamis in other parts of the world.  Why would the Haitians act like this, but other people do not?  </p>
<p>Probably the legacy of French slavery, 200 years ago.  Those darn French   &mdash;   forcing the Haitians to behave like that.  Someone should punish the French!</p>

<p>True to form. But not to contemporary myth.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think that if Hollywood ever did a movie version of the Haiti earthquake,  self-important whites would be the bad guys withholding sustenance, and the blacks would be heroically noble in their suffering, holding hands and singing &#8220;we shall overcome&#8221; with chins held high, and speaking folksy wisdoms to each other.</p>

		<p>Poor Mike.  It would appear that he thought he was going to help a bunch of American mid-Westerners rebuild after a flood or tornado.</p>
<p>Hey, Mike, I truly admire your intentions, but these are black Africans, not a bunch of Chinese, Vietnamese, or whites struggling to rebuild after a disaster.  These people know little more than how to sit on their haunches and howl, &#8220;What you gonna do for us?&#8221;  And then express outrage when the expected miracles of salvation and rebuilding fail to appear promptly while they munch on relief rations and admire their new shoes and clothes.</p>
<p>Sorry, they&rsquo;re not like the rest of us, as they&rsquo;ve amply demonstrated wherever they&rsquo;re found in the world, turning order and prosperity into squalor, turning lands of plenty into lands of desperation, poverty, and crime.  This is what they do, everywhere they&rsquo;re found.  This is what they&rsquo;ve done in the two hundred years since Haiti gained its independence. It&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve done and what they&rsquo;re doing in Watts, Newark, Columbus, Atlanta, New Orleans, Houston since they arrived after Katrina, Detroit, Cleveland, Jamaica, Guyana, Trinidad, and the list goes on&hellip;</p>

He went to Haiti <b>&ldquo;to love on these people.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>How nauseating.</p>
<p>Now, for starters, he&rsquo;s going to adopt one and bring back at least 30 more for other white fools to adopt. He will smugly inflict further burdens on the already besieged people of Dallas and the U.S, certain in his abject, criminal ignorance that he is doing God&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>He obviously knows nothing of Haiti and its population. But he&rsquo;s learning on the job. If he survives, he may even wise up.</p>

		<p>You see the true nature of people when the chips are down! These Haitians demonstrate the lack of restraint that typifies their race, culture and typical living conditions. This volunteers heart is in the right place&hellip;I hope his mind wakes up before he gets eaten. Experience continues to demonstrate racial differences in behavior contrary to marxist spin. As America receives more of people like this .. its level of higher virtue will decline as will its overall value. Its said&hellip;:{ you are what you eat}&hellip;it might as well be said :{a nation is what it eats}/(lets in).</p>

<p>The comments on the original web site are interesting: several blame him for having unrealistic, religiously-inspired expectations.  I agree with that part; a realistic person would have stayed home. </p>

		<p>Did this guy help out the Italians after their earthquake or do the people have to be black to merit any help? I hope this experience helps Mike recognize where his real loyalties should lie, and that is with the white race that provided the opportunities, gene pools, and inherent intelligence for him to rise to his present station in life. Money or no, this guy will learn a valuable lesson. Love thine own.</p>

		<p>Some of the best Christians I&rsquo;ve ever met, I met working in the reconstruction after the Guatemala earthquake of 1976. Mike Roberts is certainly a good man, and I think he is learning an important lesson: even though we are all equal before God, we are not all equally good at contributing to society and cooperating with each other. This is the &#8220;realism&#8221; part of &#8220;race realism&#8221;.</p>

		<p>S.L. Cain, that is how some white men speak  &mdash;  in the South. A lot of &#8220;ebonics&#8221; forms of speech (though not primarily the accent itself) were originally gotten from white Southerners and their ways of speaking (understandably, since blacks first learned English in most instances from their Southern masters and overseers).</p>

		<p>I wish more liberal whites would follow in this businessman&rsquo;s footsteps, just for the experience, instead of adopting Haitian babies, or sobbing over heart-rending images on the TV screen.  Who knows, maybe they&rsquo;ll they finally wake up?  When the power goes out and there is no food or water, heaven forbid if you were stuck in a black country like Haiti.</p>
<p>I could never figure out why third world people keep breeding babies they can&rsquo;t afford, then expect the rest of the world to shoulder the burden.  There ought to be some aggressive birth control program so babies wouldn&rsquo;t keep growing up and dying in poverty.</p>

But ESPECIALLY THE PATIENTS IN THE HOSPITAL! Some people need it more. Did you fail to get that point, Mr.Stuart?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;I feel for these people who have never had a honest government.  When the power goes out and there is no food or water, civilization breaks down quickly.&#8221;</i>   <br>
But ESPECIALLY SO in Haiti! Does civilization break down in Japan whenever they have an earthquake?  Why not, Mr. Stuart?</p>
<p>And btw, WHO is their government?  It is THEM! They, their own people. They&rsquo;re not under some foreign rule by outsiders.  In fact, they were much better off when they were. Even now, it takes outsiders to get anything done and do it right.</p>

		<p>It reminds of Christ and the Sermon on the Mount.  The crowd was hungry but they obeyed and sat on the grass and waited their turn to be fed.  They got food and the sermon.  People have got to be willing to follow direction and wait their turn.  Otherwise, you have chaos and waste.</p>

		<p>I think Mike Roberts should clear up any doubt that he holds negative, &#8220;RACIST&#8221; views about the Black Haitians he went down to help.</p>
<p>I think he should agree to do many blood exchanges with HIV+ bi-sexual Haitian drug users. Until rich White Americans like Mike Roberts make the effort to share the experiences oppressed third world people of color experience&hellip;</p>
<p>EVERY DAY</p>
<p>Then RACISM and the unequal distribution between the &#8220;Haves&#8221; and the &#8220;Have - Nots&#8221; will continue.</p>
<p>Come on Mike Roberts - do the blood exchange, all the world&rsquo;s people are brothers.</p>
