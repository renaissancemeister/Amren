			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kimberly Dvorak, National Examiner, January 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Each year in the United States the immigration department holds a lottery where 50,000 immigrants who seek to reside in America can win the golden ticket and gain legal entry into the country. The popular program is only available for those countries that do not send a large number of immigrants to the U.S.</p>
<p>In an effort to remove any possible security risks, Congressmen Lamar Smith (R-TX) and Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) have asked Chairman of the Judiciary committee, John Conyers (D-MI) urging the committee to consider eliminating the annual visa lottery. (Note: state sponsors of terrorism are not excluded from the lottery.)</p>
<p>The Congressmen pointed out countries that are eligible for the visa lottery include; Iran, Sudan, Cuba as well as 13 of the 14 nations the Transportation Security Administration&rsquo;s (TSA) crack down on airport security, including Nigeria home country of the Christmas Day terrorist incident.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Congressman Smith continued to say the visa lottery is a dangerous game with our national security. &#8220;America already has the most generous immigration policy in the world, admitting over one million legal immigrants each year. But under the current lottery system, up to 50,000 randomly selected alien applicants win visas each year, many from countries with a significant terrorist presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report stating the visa lottery system &#8220;is vulnerable to fraudulent activity committed by and against applicants.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; The report continued to say &#8220;widespread use of fake documents, such as birth certificates, marriage certificates and passports, presented challenges in the government&rsquo;s ability to verify the identities of applicants and dependents.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to this report, at the 109th Congress, the State Department Inspector General testified before Congress that the visa lottery &#8220;contains significant risks to national security from hostile intelligence officers, criminals and terrorists attempting to use the program for entry into the U.S. as permanent residents.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Congressman Goodlatte also introduced the Visa Lottery Elimination Act on May 7, 2009 and the legislation currently resides within the House Judiciary Committee. Perhaps now the Democratic leadership within the committee will put this bill at the top of their &#8220;to do list.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Too little too late.  The terrorist live all over the world.  They will either come in from the UK, through Canada or sneak accross the Rio Grande.  There was a song years ago that went something like &#8220;can&rsquo;t you get it through your head, its over, its over nnow&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll bet Conyers and his pals won&rsquo;t do a thing to end this insane policy. Why? Because they would be doing something that makes sense and helps protect the country. When&rsquo;s the last time they did something like that? And I&rsquo;ve never seen the black leaders in congress do anything to help or protect blacks. Those like Conyers, Maxine Waters and Charlie Rangel probably look down on blacks. Yet blacks in general don&rsquo;t seem to realize blacks in congress do nothing to help them. More immigration of any kind swells black unemployment already at record levels. And Obama, near God like in the eyes of  blacks, wants the borders opened even more(Napolitano has ceased border enforcement)so Mexicans can compete with blacks for low level jobs. I think Bush, disaster that he was, cared more for blacks than the president from Kenya.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s bull and they know it.  There are terrorists coming out of every country in the world including Indonesia.  They won&rsquo;t bar people from all of them.</p>
<p>More come from Saudi Arabia than anywhere else, and I&rsquo;m betting they don&rsquo;t classify their country as a terrorist one.</p>
<p>The West, including ALL of Europe, Australia and the US have already imported an entire army of jihadists.  Many mosques preach hatred against their new countries, and since they amount to numbers now in the millions it&rsquo;s a bit late to start barring Muslims coming from any country.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re told that MOST of the ones in the West right now are peaceful, but I&rsquo;m willing to bet the ranch they would go on a jihad rant if a fatwa were called by the chief honchos within the Sunni and Sharia sects.</p>

		<p>The visa lottery should be eliminated entirely.  Handing out a ticket to citizenship at random is something so dumb only a United States politician could come up with it.</p>
