<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Around 1,000 pregnant women who are illegal immigrants will no longer receive prenatal services through the federal-state Medicaid program, beginning in early spring, according to Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services leaders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Because of the strong pro-life sentiment, Nebraska also has provided Medicaid coverage for all pregnant women, regardless of their immigration status. The assumption is that the prenatal coverage also is for the benefit of the unborn child, who will be a U.S. citizen once born.</p>
<p>However, federal officials have told state leaders that federal law prohibits Medicaid coverage for people who are not documented except for emergency care. That means no prenatal care for pregnant moms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The only Medicaid coverage that is available for an undocumented alien pregnant woman is the cost of delivery and the cost of treating complications of pregnancy considered to be emergencies,&#8221; [said Vivianne Chaumont, director of the Division of Medicaid and Long-Term Care, in a letter to state senators].</p>
<p>The federal government pays for about 60 percent of the costs of the Medicaid coverage and state taxes pay the rest.</p>
<p>If senators want to provide prenatal care for pregnant mothers who are illegal residents, the Legislature will have to create a separate non-Medicaid program in state statute, according to the letter from Chaumont.</p>
<p>The state is reviewing the 6,000 pregnant women receiving Medicaid-funded prenatal care, according to Kerry Winterer, CEO of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. All women who are not legally in the country will lose their benefits, likely on March 1, he said.</p>
<p>The state estimates that somewhere around 1,000 women now receiving prenatal care are undocumented and will lose Medicaid prenatal coverage. That coverage costs around $850 to $950 per woman, according to Chaumont.</p>

I think there is something wrong with the people of Nebraska. When I was there last summer I was going through a nice, clean,
orderly town of about 5,000 residents. I stopped at a grocery to
pick up a few items and right there on the front page was an
article about the soon to be arriving Somali refuges. As I
drove through the town I noticed some propaganda painted on
the side of a building. It was a pair of hands, one white and
one black, clasped together along with the message, &#8220;If we don&rsquo;t 
get along together, we shall parish together&hellip;&#8221;. I&rsquo;m 
paraphrasing but that is pretty close. You get the idea. When
driving through Lincoln I saw a big sign that pointed me to the
Rosa Parks memorial freeway. I stopped at a Nebraska welcome 
center and picked up a Nebraska visitor&rsquo;s guide. In the guide it 
listed famous people of Nebraska: Father Edward Flanagan, Johnny 
Carson, James Coburn, Buffalo Bill Cody, &hellip;, Malcom X. What, Malcom X? OK, he is &#8220;famous&#8221; but certainly not in the same sense 
as Father Edward Flanagan. What would posses the people of 
Nebraska to claim a man as a native son, when said man considers 
white people blue eyed devils that are destined to burn in hell? 
Though I haven&rsquo;t verified this, he apparently spent time in the 
Michigan State Penitentiary for narcotics dealing and armed 
robbery. He allegedly also used to pimp. Are people in Nebraska 
that ignorant of Malcom X and his doings or do they just not 
care? Or worse, do they approve? Naturally, not all Nebraskans 
do in fact have a love for Somalis, Rosa Parks, or Malcom X but 
it certainly is disturbing to see that the rot has spread from
the multi-cultural epicenters to the heartland.

<p>Whenever a conservative says they are pro-Constitution, pro-liberty, and anti-statism, they are lying.  Conservatism does not lead to less government, it leads to more government.  Liberals want to steal money from working people to pay for healthcare for illegal immigrants because healthcare is a right.  Conservatives want to steal money from working people to pay for healthcare for illegal immigrants because it will lead to fewer abortions and because family values don&rsquo;t stop at the Rio Grande.  The end result is the same: bigger government and less freedom.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re even more right than you know.  Even backing out the aborticide issue, just the increasing presence of more and more Hispanics will mean a bigger, more intrusive, higher taxing and more abusive government.  That is because that&rsquo;s what most Hispanics deserve, because that (save the welfare) is the kind of system from which they come.  Most people get the government they deserve.</p>

<p>Probably 5,000 mostly white residents. It is these types of communities, who do not have much experience with blacks, that often rush to embrace the multicult/diversicrat agenda. They desperately want to show the everyone how progressive and tolerant they are but, in the end, wind up ruining otherwise safe, peaceful communities. </p>

		<p>Odoacer: I am a conservative/constitutionalist/libertarian and I do not want big government, or ANY benefits for illegal aliens other than a bus heading straight for the border as soon as they are caught and convicted.  Frankly, I&rsquo;m sick of birthright citizenship and I want to see it end and all illegal parents of anchor babies deported immediately!  The illegal parents can take their children with them, or give them up for adoption here, I don&rsquo;t care!</p>

<p>Your idea on telling these illegals &#8220;Okay your kids can stay in America as Americans but YOU have to go so here are your two choices&#8221; Number one take your child back to where you came from, with no benefits coming from the USA or leave them here to be adopted by True Americans who will raise them as their own. This idea is beautiful in it&rsquo;s simplicity, and fairness.</p>

These small towns become targets for refugee programs that are often run by churches such as the Lutherans and Catholics.  These have refugee programs that have become cottage industries for those who are too good to work in the private sector.</p>
<p>This has been going on for some time: the Hmung were dumped on the midwest, the Somalis were dumped on Lewiston, Maine.  Nobody asks the people, they just go ahead and dump the &#8220;refugees&#8221; on some poor unsuspecting community.  Look at the politicians and these &#8220;charities&#8221;  &mdash;   they are the culprits.  A city in my state was used as a dumping ground for refugees about twenty years ago.  First the city was declared a &#8220;gateway city&#8221; by the local congressman, then these refugees started pouring into the city until they made up a quarter of the city&rsquo;s population within a period of about 5 years.  The politicians and &#8220;charities&#8221; work like a well oiled machine in delivering these people on the doorsteps of hapless American citizens.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the rhetoric coming from any government in the U.S., federal or state. No illegal immigrants will lose health care in Nebraska or anywhere else. I have seen this before in my own state of Arizona: legally, &#8220;undocumented immigrants&#8221; are not supposed to receive state health care, welfare, etc.-but what the good folks in Phoenix don&rsquo;t tell you is that it is also illegal to inquire into the immigration status of a person asking for aid. Kinda defeats the whole purpose of the law, doesn&rsquo;t it? Sure enough, go to any welfare office in Arizona and you&rsquo;ll find every poster, sign and form written in BOTH English and Spanish. Talk to any welfare worker and they&rsquo;ll tell you &#8220;yep, most of the money for welfare and state health aid goes to illegals&hellip;we know they&rsquo;re illegals, but what can we do?&#8221; So forgive me if I am bit cynical about this whole &#8220;let&rsquo;s get tough on illegals thing&#8221;. There is only one to get tough on them: BOOT THEM ALL OUT!!!</p>
