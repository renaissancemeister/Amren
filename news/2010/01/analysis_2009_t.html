<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20091231/US.Year.in.Race.Analysis/">Analysis: 2009 Transformed US Racial Dynamics</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse Washington, Comcast News, Dec. 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The year began with a harmonious glow at the inauguration of the first black president, as America marked a stunning victory over its racial demons.</p>
<p>&#8220;That lasted about a day,&#8221; President Barack Obama said two months later. He attributed that to the economic calamity threatening all Americans, but his statement also applied to the notion that all our racial problems had been solved.</p>
<p>The dynamics of race were transformed in 2009 because the most powerful person on Earth was no longer white. But despite that potent symbol  &mdash;  and sometimes because of it  &mdash;  race remained a volatile and often divisive subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;It felt like an evolution to me, something that created a paradigm shift,&#8221; says Dr. Joy DeGruy, a black author and speaker who focuses on racial healing. &#8220;We moved a quantum leap forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conservative radio host Mike Gallagher calls the change &#8220;profound&#8221; and says there were fewer racial controversies last year than in almost any other during his 30-plus years of radio.</p>
<p>&#8220;I get the sense from my audience collectively that there is a sigh of relief, that we&rsquo;ve made progress this year,&#8221; says Gallagher, who is white. &#8220;Because I truly believe that good people don&rsquo;t want to be mired in racial conflict.&#8221;</p>
<p>One sign of that progress was Elwin Wilson. Inspired by reaction to the inauguration, he sought out U.S. Rep. John Lewis. They had last met in 1961, when Wilson and other white racists brutally beat Lewis during a Freedom Ride civil rights protest in South Carolina.</p>
<p>Wilson apologized, and Lewis accepted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it will lead to a great deal of healing,&#8221; the black congressman said.</p>
<p>The year held many milestones. George Lopez became the first Latino host of a late-night TV show. Ursula Burns became the first black woman to lead a Fortune 500 company, Xerox. The Indian model Padma Lakshmi starred in commercials for shampoo and hamburgers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But there was pain amid the progress.</p>
<p>The disorderly conduct arrest of black scholar Henry Louis Gates by a white officer after he forced open the jammed front door of his home seemed like a throwback to an earlier, divided era.</p>
<p>The issue was inflamed when Obama slipped from his race-neutral stance and said that police who arrested Gates had &#8220;acted stupidly.&#8221; Obama&rsquo;s poll numbers among whites plunged; he then invited the cop and the professor to meet at the White House.</p>
<p>In May, three white teens in Shenandoah, Pa., were acquitted of the most serious charges in the beating death of Luis Ramirez, an illegal Mexican immigrant. The case became a rallying cry for Latino activists who called it part of a rising tide of anti-Hispanic hate crimes. Federal hate-crime charges were filed against two of the teens in December.</p>
<p>Latino groups also demanded the ouster of CNN host Lou Dobbs for his anti-immigration rhetoric, and he resigned in November. Another resignation was a white justice of the peace in Louisiana who had refused to marry an interracial couple, citing concern for their future children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The idea was connected to an argument that gained traction this year: That Obama&rsquo;s election proved the playing field had finally been leveled, and that the biggest remaining barrier to black progress was black attitudes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not white racism that plays the deciding role in success among minorities anymore,&#8221; says Edward Blum, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who studies civil rights policy issues.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court appeared to agree in June, when it ruled 5-4 that a group of white firefighters were unfairly denied promotions because no blacks performed well enough on the exam. (Sotomayor had ruled against the white firefighters on a lower court, citing precedent that said a test is discriminatory if it had a disparate racial impact.)</p>
<p>&#8220;This is just proof positive that people should be treated as individuals and not statistics,&#8221; said Frank Ricci, the firefighter whose name was on the lawsuit.</p>
<p>But statistics on high black unemployment were the primary evidence used by the Congressional Black Caucus in December when it demanded that Obama provide special assistance to jobless blacks.</p>

		<p>A stunning victory over America&rsquo;s racial demons?</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s victory was more of a victory over the simple reality that black Africans represent a social problem in this nation, as they do in every other nation on earth in which they comprise a significant portion of the overall population.</p>
<p>His victory ultimately may be judged as a belated wake-up call for millions of Americans who were deluding themselves into thinking that the black condition in America and the rest of the world is due entirely to mindless racism.</p>

<i>&#8220;But there was pain amid the progress.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>What can we take from this statement? That the transformation from white to non-white hasn&rsquo;t happened as smoothly or as quickly as some had wished? Are there still too many white faces still visible in the public forum? </p>
<p>They want us to step aside. They want us out.</p>

		<p> Washington cherry-picks the news to find &#8220;evidence&#8221; to support his contention that a &#8220;dialogue on race&#8221; has started. If there has been no &#8220;dialogue&#8221; before, it&rsquo;s because blacks and bleeding-heart White liberals didn&rsquo;t want one. They wanted blacks yelling, &#8220;Racism! Racism! All Whitey&rsquo;s fault!&#8221; and Whites humbly nodding their heads and begging for foregiveness. That&rsquo;s not a dialogue, folks.</p>
<p> And all this talk about a &#8220;sigh of relief&#8221; at Obama&rsquo;s election ignores the fact that many, many Americans   &mdash;   not just White ones   &mdash;   have been very upset with him for the way he has mishandled his office in this first year of his term. And when such discontent is voiced, what does the left say? &#8220;You&rsquo;re opposed to President Obama because he&rsquo;s black!&#8221; Same old song, different day.</p>

<p>And the race neutral society that he pretends he so badly desires slips further away the more those like him whine about the subject, doing his share to keep race a live issue, proving once again that the issue of race is on the minds of non-whites 24/7, while most whites are content to pursue their everyday work and interests.</p>
<p>Notice he never mentioned Reverend Wright, the bad conduct of Louis Gates and his use of ghetto terms like, &#8220;Yo mama,&#8221; nor did he mention a single case of black on white racial beatings, murders and acts of intimidation, which are at epidemic levels.  Nor did he mention the fact that blacks CANNOT compete with other &#8220;people of color,&#8221; which is why they&rsquo;re unable to succeed in this civilization and not the worn out excuse of slavery, oppression and racism.</p>
<p>This is just another black whose idea of racial injustice is requiring blacks to qualify for things in the same manner and degree as whites.</p>
<p>And notice that he gives the appearance of being for all non-whites, yet if blacks were in charge they would be the first to disallow Hiuspanics or other races to have a place at the table.</p>
<p>Right now he is in his &#8220;let&rsquo;s pretend it is people of color united as one against whites&#8221; mode, when the fact of the matter is that, generally, the vast majority of all non-whites are for their own tribes only and they have no desire to give up anything to other non-whites if they were in control.</p>
<p>If the country consisted of all non-whites in equal numbers the fights would be unending.</p>

<p>Ironically, despite all the nitwitted Communist excuse making for the ghastly mulatto demigod and &ldquo;most powerful person on Earth&rdquo; that is Comrade General Secretary BO, I do believe that the &ldquo;dynamics of race&rdquo; have been unalterably transformed in the year 2009. This unchangeable alteration was not however something that most persons &ldquo;of color&rdquo; should be feverishly drooling over, like Pavlov&rsquo;s dogs might upon hearing the &ldquo;Carol of the Bells.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKrx-4Awe70&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKrx-4Awe70&feature;=related</a></p>
<p>Multiculturalism as the ubiquitous American (and more &ldquo;subtly&rdquo; general Western) political &ldquo;religion,&rdquo; was delivered an astonishingly hopeful and unparalleled smiting fusion bomb of change. Never again, will it be even remotely plausible to claim that increasing diversity, is a cure-all richness similar to a eating a roast suckling pig stuffed with pure butter and Turkish delight. We have elected it outright in this country, and what has it gotten us here in the USA: regal utopia or repellant myopia? </p>
<p>These Red fools have gambled everything on a dwarfed donkey, that they thought was a titanic tyrannosaurus; they did this because they are stupid enough, to have begun to believe in their own &ldquo;infallibility.&rdquo; </p>
<p>2010, will likely have them bitterly licking their wounds, in those convulsing rectums that they call their &ldquo;brains!&rdquo;</p>
<p>May God let it be so!!!</p>

<p>The truth is that the playing field STARTED level, and any &#8220;inequalities&#8221; that arose were a result of inequalities in ability.</p>

		<p>I assume the reporter for this column made an innocent mistake in forgetting to mention Channon Christian and Christopher Newsome, or how Obamacare is trying to fleece the living daylights out of the mostly white middle class to pay for health care for 20-30 million illegal aliens, most of whom are here from Mexico.  And, also to force whites to pay for free health care for his black brothers here in America.   </p>
<p>Or, how the left was caught lying about this Global-Warming or Climate Change nonsense, in a not so subtle attempt to fleece the mostly White middle class taxpayers in America and in other dominant European nations out of billions of dollars in what amounted to a Global redistribution of primarily white wealth from White nations to non-white Third World nations.</p>
<p>In short, I think the somber lesson that should be gleaned from placing a non-White, clearly anti-white Marxist in charge of a majority white nation is that this fellow will use his power and authority in whatever way he can to fleece as much from the pockets and paychecks of whites as he can, for as long as he can.    And the same can be said for any non-white given the same power and authority, friends.   Hence, the answer to this reality is simple: In order for Whites to survive and prosper, free from the threat of being reduced to tax slaves for non-white demands - we must have an exclusive white homeland.  <br>

<p>It&rsquo;s been awhile since &#8220;the most powerful person on Earth&#8221; was White.  He&rsquo;s been Chinese for almost a decade, now.  Bush&rsquo;s silly gunfighter swagger fooled most Americans into thinking their country still mattered.  But the picture of Obama, apologetic and hat in hand, is pretty much the reality of American life, today.  Want to see a vision of America&rsquo;s immediate and prolonged future? Look to Detroit, a city in perpetual decline, impoverished, anarchic, and ruled over by Afro-oligarchs.</p>

		<p>The election of black jesus has not improved race relations it&rsquo;s made them worse in my opinion.On the job,blacks are more OPENLY anti-white that any time in my 21 years in the job market.Most black men won&rsquo;t even speak to white co-workers(literally),they just give you the silent treatment and stare at you funny.The three mexicans have a chip on there shoulder the size of a aircraft carrier,whenever they speak to each other they do so in spanish loud enough to be heard a mile away(there way of letting whitey know what they really think about him).I shudder to think what &#8220;post racial&#8221; america is going to be like ten years from now.</p>

<p>Reading the sentence above one would think there was some relation between the two facts contained in the sentence - there isn&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>La Raza types have been attacking Lou Dobbs for years for his stance on illegal immigration. - Incidentally, his unforgivable stance is that the law should be enforced. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Bush 2 was in league with the Mexican government for eight years precisely to evade doing so, so much so that he actually had proscecuted and imprisoned two border guards for trying to carry out their duty.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle to getting federal immigration law genuinely enforced on behalf of the American people IS the federal government.  </p>

		<p>People keep mentioning black crime and unemployment as proof of how backward blacks are.  Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s only all a result of inequality.  The government will soon have race-based quotas for incarceration and employment.  Blacks will be &#8216;equal&rsquo; with whites then!  Isn&rsquo;t social justice great!</p>
