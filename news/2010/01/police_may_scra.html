			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Bryant, NBCChicago.com, January 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Chicago Police Department is seriously considering scrapping the police entrance exam, sources tell Fran Spielman.</p>
<p>Dropping the exam would bolster minority hiring and avert legal battles, according to one source, while others confirm that the exam could be scrapped to open the process to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>However, the lack of an exam would make Chicago the lone major city without one, and experts contend that the exam is integral to eliminating unqualified applicants.</p>
<p>The CPD has tried in recent years to boost minority hiring by offering the police exam online and turning to minority clergy to help in the recruitment effort.</p>
<p>But those efforts have met with frustration. {snip}</p>
<p>And as of last year, one in four patrol officers were African-American, but just one in 12 Lieutenants were of color.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The CPD is currently operating at 2,000 officers-a-day short of its authorized strength. Police hired only 46 officers this year, with plans to hire less than 100 next year  &mdash;  and those hirings rely on federal funds.</p>

<p>No need to even be an American Citizen.</p>
<p>They could just hire straight from the penitentiary, as those folks have a better background in police procedures than your average law abiding citizen.</p>

		<p>If they&rsquo;re not going to have an entrance exam, then why bother doing criminal background checks?  Kansas City Mayor Mark Funhouser (deliberately misspelling his last name just in case it sounds too much like a curse word and gets filtered out) proposed that the KCPD accept adult convicted felons as cops in order to get more blacks, so why should a progressive civil rights endowed big city in the Land of Lincoln get beat to the punch by a cow town?  </p>
<p>About a year ago, a teenager was able to pretend to be an on-duty cop right along side of real CPD officers for almost a whole Saturday.  He went so far as to drive a squad car and engage in a foot chase of a suspect.  Why not just get rid of age limits and let him be a real cop?</p>

		<p>There has been controversy regarding the CPD basic entry exam for the last forty years or so.</p>
<p>As I recall, the last time they gave the test for an en masse group of applicants, 33,000 persons took the test, only half passing, and a passing score was 50 %. It was rumored that two women among the test takers had gotten all 128 questions answered correctly, but that they would have not gotten any more consideration for being hired than someone that had only a 50 % test score.</p>
<p>Nolan, the head of the police union, voiced concern as to the quality of the police officer being hired, given such poor results on an ENTRY level test.</p>
<p>And the hiring process also entails the physical exam, an agility and strength test, a psychological screening, a polygraph exam and background check, an oral exam, and then entry into the police academy only after all that, and only in limited numbers. </p>
<p>Those psychological screenings in large measure ask a lot of questions designed to &#8220;weed out&#8221; whites that have &#8220;problems&#8221; with minorities.</p>
<p>MIND you, this is all just to get ON the force.</p>

		<p>And like always, whites will furrow their brows for a few moments, then return to their X-Box trance or their season tickets at the local African-dominated sporting event. </p>
<p>The black &#8220;clergy&#8221; (if an internet-ordained, storefront &#8220;preacher&#8221; qualifies as such) will champion the cause and yet even more unqualified, idiot minorities will assume positions of considerable power and authority. </p>
<p>There is no longer any need for whites to be led to the slaughter&hellip;most of them will go straight there on their own. </p>

		<p>This is proof positive that all the &#8220;leaders&#8221; of the &#8220;black community&#8221; are just hustlers and con-artists, for if this isn&rsquo;t a straight-up admission that non-whites are incapable of competing with Whites, nothing is! After decades of attmepting in vain, to blame the various exams themselves for being &#8220;biased,&#8221; they have obviously found the only real way to ensure that non-whites(blacks primarily)will pass the exam&hellip;do away with it altogether. If indeed blacks were possessed of greater than room-temperature IQ&rsquo;s on average, they would presumably be highly offended by all this. But alas, that won&rsquo;t be an issue&hellip;</p>

		<p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t need me to pontificate that it is an essential job requirement for police officers to have a goood standard of general education, especially of literacy.<br>
 The entirety of the job revolves around enforcing written laws, acting within those laws and procedural process within those laws - how many strong cases have been destroyed by shyster lawyers because of procedural irregularities.<br>
 Contrary to what many might think the &#8216;strong-arm&rsquo; enforcing nature of police work is only one part of the job.</p>

		<p>Chicago is a great city to visit, but you don&rsquo;t want to live there. If I had to work in Chicago, I would live in Valparaiso or Chesterton, Indiana, buy a diesel VW and drive in every day. On practically every street corner are those annoying red light cameras that end up mailing out tickets like confetti. Good luck talking with anyone to get that fixed. Your best bet is to buy one of those license covers. We&rsquo;re not even going to talk about the gun laws there. </p>
<p>Chicago has enough bad apples among the cops who passed the entrance exam, why would you want to avoid filtering out people who shouldn&rsquo;t be in law enforcement. </p>
<p>I wonder if some enterprising attorney who is willing to become the most hated man in America could turn this thing on its head. <br>
Done correctly, especially with an Asian or high functioning set of hispanics, I wonder if this could be turned into the case that finally forces SCOTUS to decide which takes precedence. The 14th amendment or Griggs vs. Duke (the case that gave us &#8220;disparate impact&#8221;). </p>

		<p>Well, if they do away with the police entrance exam that will be the last nail in the coffin of White males getting any City jobs whatsoever.  Mayor Richard M. Daley has stated that &#8220;he is sold on Affirmative Action&#8221; as he put it some years ago.  If you walk thru the various departments at City Hall you will notice very fast that the employee population is made up entirely of non-whites, Blacks having the largest numbers with Hispanics quickly closing the gap.  Whites are not organized as other races are in Chicago nor do they have much political clout so they just roll over and play dead.  At least the Police Department gave young White males a chance at a good paying job with a great pension and other benefits.  Now that will end when the &#8220;rubber stamp&#8221; City Council of Aldermen just nod their ascent to the Mayor&rsquo;s wishes.  I think one of the reasons that young White males especially put up with being treated as second class citizens is that they have been brain washed from grammar school thru high school and college.  Most if not all government jobs at the local, State and Federal levels have been allocated to minorities.  This is just another scheme to put more of them into these good paying jobs.</p>

		<p>Anon#2: There is no requirement to be an American citizen, any longer. Look at the Stooge that we have in the White House. Birth Certificate, anoyone? </p>
<p>What amazes me, is that he is still there, without providing that document, and his Medical, and School records, too. Who cares, anyway, right? It&rsquo;s only the Presidency. </p>
<p>And why force these poor downtrodden Blacks and browns to take any written exams, in the first place? That would suggest that they know how to read English.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s reflect on that. In the 1950s, Blacks protested to end School Segregation, to go to White Schools. Whites fought Desegregration, and forced Bussing, through the 1970s. </p>
<p>Today, the Whites, get a dumbed down education, as opposed to what they used to get, so these &#8220;poor&#8221; Blacks and browns can keep up, which they still fail to do. All this is going on, while Whites are being attacked in those very Schools. </p>
<p>So, it looks like it all worked out quite well. </p>

		<p>I had a stroke a couple of years ago, and can&rsquo;t stand for more than 15 minutes at a time. I also can&rsquo;t run by any stretch of the imagination. I am also 5&rsquo; 6&#8221; tall and nearly 200 pounds. But I really, REALLY want to be a police officer. I&rsquo;m also a female, so if they deny me the chance to become a police person, they are discriminating against me on the grounds that I am a &#8220;minority&#8221; right? Since I don&rsquo;t live in the Chicago area, don&rsquo;t expect to see me personally out there writing tickets, but somebody in the same physical shape just might be soon if this idiotic rule continues. </p>

		<p>In other news, the NBA announced today that they will end their outmoded, controversial procedures for selecting NBA players.</p>
<p>The NBA has historically selected players based on athletic qualities, such as how high they jump and the accuracy of their shooting.  However, it has become increasingly clear that such tests are inherently biased, and bar short, fat, and un-athletic people from these professions.  Persons gifted with paraplegia, Down&rsquo;s Syndrome, dwarfism, and multiple sclerosis, likewise have been previously prevented from NBA employment.<br>
  <br>
Henceforth, all NBA players will be selected from among these disadvantaged groups, in order to remedy past bias.  &ldquo;We will put an end to &ldquo;athletic-privilege&rdquo; and create a more perfect, utopian, egalitarian society,&rdquo; said Dr. Moonshadow Laughing-Crow-O&rsquo;Brian, Distinguished Professor of Hate and Prejudice, at the University of Multicultural Studies.<br>

Absolutely. The writing on the wall is perfectly clear, and it has been for some time:  the abolition of all exams and standards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the solution for those who can&rsquo;t pass, no matter how many times the exams have been jiggled and simplified and doctored to make them easier and easier. </p>
<p>If you still can&rsquo;t pass the dratted exam, just ABOLISH IT! </p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re coming to.  Eventually, jobs (especially good ones) will be apportioned on the basis of skin color and language, on rigid ethnic quotas  (ie. tribes),   and on whom you know (families). </p>
<p>Not so different from any other African or Third World country    &mdash;  - which we soon will be.</p>

Here in NYC, there has been agitation for years to limit hiring of police and firemen to applicants from within the city limits. Nothing racial was ever said, and I never realized it before, when I was still more naive about these things, that it was just another, disguised way of cutting down on the number of whites and favoring blacks/nonwhites. Now, I can see it.  When you limit hiring to residents of the city,  and  exclude the suburbs, you&rsquo;re automatically cutting out a large pool of whites. And you don&rsquo;t have to say a word about race.   Just another form of anti-white discrimination that most would never recognize.</p>

		<p>As someone working in computers, I can tell you that White males are not wanted in most city governments. Many senior-level computer operations manager/director jobs are advertised as requiring a GED or equivalent. This is to cast the net as wide as possible so as to allow the hiring of a black or Hispanic who never finished high school. When I interview for such jobs I am told that I could do the job very well, but that they don&rsquo;t need someone with a Master&rsquo;s, or tons of real world experience doing exactly what the position requires. What they need is a minority figurehead who can delegate the decisions to a White underling. </p>

<p>The black slaves in early America enjoyed a better standard of living centuries ago than the majority of blacks do today in Africa.  </p>
<p>There wouldn&rsquo;t be a single country today in Africa if white colonialists hadn&rsquo;t created them.  </p>
<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for whites African blacks wouldn&rsquo;t have written languages or knowledge of the wheel.  </p>
<p>And African blacks can thank whites for every mile of paved roads, electric, sewer, and telephone lines in Africa.  </p>
<p>American blacks refuse to acknowledge these facts and continue to play the victim card and make ludicrous demands.  </p>
<p>Eventually whites will grow tired of black carping and do what they should have done long&hellip;</p>
