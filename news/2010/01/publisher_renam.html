<h1>Publisher Renames Joseph Conrad Classic &#8216;The N-Word of the Narcissus&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joshua Rhett Miller, FoxNews, January 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>WordBridge Publishing has defended its version of Conrad&rsquo;s classic as a &#8220;public service,&#8221; according to its Web site.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Joseph Conrad, whose &#8220;Heart of Darkness&#8221; and &#8220;Lord Jim&#8221; have been scrutinized by English students on multiple continents for decades, wrote a lesser known novel in 1897 called &#8220;The Nigger of the Narcissus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, in what critics are calling a blatant act of politically correct censorship, a Netherlands-based publisher has reprinted the novel under a new name: &#8220;The N-word of the Narcissus.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new version is the first installment of WordBridge Publishing&rsquo;s classic texts series, featuring &#8220;texts with a message for moderns, made accessible to moderns.&#8221;</p>
<p>But some critics say updating a Conrad novel by replacing all mentions of the offensive term &#8220;nigger&#8221; with &#8220;n-word&#8221; is just as offensive as the word itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s outrageous,&#8221; said Niger Innis, spokesman for the Congress of Racial Equality, a New York-based civil rights organization. &#8220;Are they going to go to Mark Twain as well and take out all of those references?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Innis said it would be equally inappropriate for Alex Haley&rsquo;s &#8220;Roots&#8221; to be re-released with instances of the racial slur replaced with a more innocuous term.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP&rsquo;s Washington bureau and senior vice president for advocacy and policy, said he found the new version of Conrad&rsquo;s novel appropriate for readers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said the latest version of Conrad&rsquo;s classic is not an example of censorship because its original intent remains intact.</p>
<p>&#8220;You and I know what that means,&#8221; said Shelton. &#8220;The word really is still there but it takes into consideration those who would rather not read such derogatory language.&#8221;</p>
<p>In any form, however, Shelton said the offensive term has no place in modern society.</p>
<p>&#8220;It belongs in our history, it is part of our history,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it should be dead and gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to WordBridge&rsquo;s Web site, the renaming of Conrad&rsquo;s classic is a &#8220;public service&#8221; to readers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new version addresses the reason for its neglect: the profusion of the so-called n-word throughout its pages,&#8221; the site reads. &#8220;Hence, the introduction of &#8216;n-word&rsquo; throughout the text, to remove this offence to modern sensibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can&rsquo;t read the important documents of our culture in their original form, with some understanding of their context, we may as well stop trying to understand past artists and thinkers altogether,&#8221; one comment read.</p>

		<p>My black students use this word all the time.</p>
<p>I doubt if my students would read the word in a book, however, because they don&rsquo;t like books.</p>
<p>They do like to be outraged, so maybe I&rsquo;ll tell them about the new version. They&rsquo;ll find something to &#8220;kirk out&#8221; about.</p>

		<p>If this guy (or girl) Hilary Shelton,wants the word &#8220;N***er to be &#8220;dead and gone&#8221;, then he should be telling blacks all over the urban basketball courts and football fields and baseball diamonds, and high school track meets to stop using the word amongst each other. I use the word all the time with coworkers who are white. I don&rsquo;t care. They use it with their kind and they use &#8216;cracker&rsquo; and &#8216;honkey&rsquo; and &#8220;whiteboy&#8221; and so I&rsquo;ll use derogatory terms about them. It doesn&rsquo;t get any more fair than that, equal rights not special rights.  </p>

		<p>What I find funniest about this entire episode is that the use of the &#8220;n-word&#8221; itself should be the least objectionable part of this novel for the p.c. crowd.  I&rsquo;ve read the book more than once, though not in quite a while, and it happens to concern a lazy, shiftless sailor who signs up for a voyage with no intention of working.  He instantly starts complaining about the conditions aboard the ship, then conveniently takes &#8220;ill&#8221; for nearly the entire voyage.  His intent is to magically recover just before the ship takes to port, so he can collect his wages anyhow.  Problem is, by faking illness, he places himself in dank, stifling quarters, and by the end of the novel, he has become quite sick, and dies, basically a result of his laziness and low cunning.  Sort of a microcosm for his brethren everywhere.  BTW  &mdash;  the sailor is mentioned in the title, and his name isn&rsquo;t &#8220;Narcissus.&#8221;</p>

Once again we see the nonsensical notion that people have some sort of RIGHT not to be exposed to things they don&rsquo;t like   &mdash;   even to the point of rewriting great authors to make them acceptable to the postmodern multicult. A &#8220;right&#8221; not to be offended. Let me assure you there is NO SUCH RIGHT   &mdash;   and all attempts to establish one will only create more problems than they solve. </p>
<p>Ms. Shelton, as a Straight White Male, I read &#8220;derogatory language&rdquo; about MY ethnic group every time I crack open a MSM newspaper. And every time switch on a TV   &mdash;   and I mean EVERY time   &mdash;   I see yet another smart black man or yet another superior white woman correcting the follies and stupidities of some goofy, shallow, lazy, thoughtless, unattractive SWM. Do you think that I too have a right to complain? Don&rsquo;t MY sensitivities and preferences also deserve to be &#8220;taken into consideration&#8221;?  </p>
<p>Whaddya mean, &#8220;No&#8221;?</p>

		<p>The unrecognized truth is that language changes over time.  What is now the &#8220;n-word&#8221;, which offends many people as much - actually far more - than the &#8220;f-word&#8221;, was once not understood with the same harshness.</p>
<p>Maybe one day someone will censor a book to replace the &#8220;d-word&#8221; (diversity)!</p>

&#8220;They use it with their kind and they use &lsquo;cracker&rsquo; and &lsquo;honkey&rsquo; and &ldquo;whiteboy&rdquo; and so I&rsquo;ll use derogatory terms about them.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  </p>
<p>The beauty of those terms is that they bounce right off white guys.  They say more about the frustration of the name-caller than anything else, and both parties know it.</p>

		<p>I suppose now the American literary 1885.AD/NPC classic by Mark Twain &#8216;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&#8221;, will require the 215 (counted&hellip;not by me though <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yjv88md" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yjv88md</a> ) occurrences of the N-word to be replaced with &#8220;non racist stereotype Jim&#8221; etc.<br>
Now that wouldn&rsquo;t change the tone and feeling of then times depicted in the book at all, would it?</p>
<p>Because in 1885.AD/NPC we were all apparently,  collectively evil and dumb, as opposed to the enlightened &#8216;everyone is equally good and bad, and colors don&rsquo;t exist&rsquo; age that we all get to live in now, hooray!!<br>
(1964.AD/NPC&gt;<br>
1965.AD/PC
2010.AD/PC + &#8216;NPC&rsquo;=2010.AD/NPC <br>
=Reality!) </p>
<p>I suppose that as we now live in this &#8216;PC&rsquo; age, that we should *White-wash(NPC) away all the past signs of intolerance, segregation and stereotyping etc. <br>
(*PC=&rsquo;transparent-wash&rsquo;&hellip;.as colors=Hate!!)<br>
 <br>
As they may offend the descendants(only) of from those who actually were discriminated against and those of us who have frankly been elevated &#8216;above all of that&rsquo; and who frankly find that part of our history embarrassing. </p>
<p>But hold on, if we transparent-wash away all the past evidence of our misdeeds, how will we be made to feel guilty by the media, our own kin and the endless line of minorities, both connected(through lineage only of course) and majority unconnected to these times? </p>
<p>Hmm, that&rsquo;s a bit of a pickle&hellip;..<br>
<i> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s outrageous,&rdquo; said Niger Innis, spokesman for the Congress of Racial Equality, a New York-based civil rights organization.</i><br>
Maybe that&rsquo;s why these guys object, it would mean the end of their gravy train, it also means that by choosing to live without the censorship, that we&rsquo;d be stuck with groups like this endless whining too though.</p>
<p>Another situation that with &#8216;diversity&rsquo; present that there is a no win scenario.<br>
Just the lesser of two evils. </p>
<p>Lets just keep the good part of history alive hey, the parts that flatter us or that serve our agenda&rsquo;s.<br>
There were no cannibals, headhunters, non White slavers or White slaves, non White wars, misogynistic or ecologically destructive natives (and so on.)<br>
I thought history was meant to be written by the winners(victors), not the losers amongst the winners?<br>

		<p>Claude Debussy&rsquo;s piano piece &#8220;The Little Nigar&#8221; (spelling weird; point clear) has been sanitized in recent editions.  Luckily I have an older edition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird how the super-leftists who rule our world only ban this one word, which is a useful one due to the fact that all humans worldwide understand it.  Every other &#8220;offensive&#8221; word imaginable is proudly used by these religious zealots, &#8220;in your face&#8221;-style.  The hippie logic system eludes me.</p>

		<p>Given the way things are going, I predict that someday the term   &#8220;N-word&#8221;  will also be banned and will have to be replaced by some new euphemism.  Even the word black may eventually be banned. It keeps getting crazier and crazier, as they keep running away from reality.</p>

Sigh.<br>
- GenX<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>And so it is!  And I believe that fact still holds true. History IS indeed written by the victors.  Cultural values ARE determined by the victors.  Laws ARE written by the victors, etc.  </p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re no longer writing them, what is wrong? Well, obviously we&rsquo;re not the victors. Not anymore.</p>
<p>If we find ourselves on the bottom, looking up, and wondering what is wrong, then perhaps that fact should stimulate us to stop and think and take a good closer look at ourselves and our situation. Maybe we&rsquo;re really no longer the winning team, after all.  Sometimes we are allowed to THINK we are the winners in order to pacify us and keep us  from making trouble. For the real winners, it&rsquo;s a lot easier that way.</p>
<p>I say if you&rsquo;re not writing history, not shaping language, not passing laws,  and not setting cultural standards, then you&rsquo;re NOT the winner, you&rsquo;re the loser.  We see it al around us!</p>

Ther&rsquo;es a Beetles song that goes: </p>
<p> <i>&#8220;I heard the news today, Oh boy!<br>
Ten thousand holes in blackened Lancashire, <br>
The English army won the war&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p><br>
No they didn&rsquo;t!  They didn&rsquo;t win that war.  They just THOUGHT they did.  They were ALLOWED to think so.  </p>
<p>I wonder what those soldiers (mostly dead) would say if they could look at Britain today.  Is this what they died for?</p>
<p>They thought they were preventing an invasion.  They had no idea the invasion that was yet to come.  </p>
