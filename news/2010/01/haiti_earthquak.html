			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Liz Hazelton, Daily Mail (London), January 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Haiti teetered on the brink of total anarchy tonight as looters rampaged through the streets of Port-au-Prince in search of food and water.</p>
<p>With desperately needed aid still barely trickling through, some survivors were reduced to fighting for scant supplies.</p>
<p>Witnesses reported gangs of young men armed with machetes stalking through the capital. As the security situation continued to deteriorate, UN peacekeepers warned aid workers they needed to travel with guards.</p>
<p>The Brazilian military, which heads the operation, said victims were increasingly desperate.</p>
<p>&#8216;Unfortunately, they&rsquo;re slowly getting more angry and impatient&rsquo; said spokesman David Wimhurst,</p>
<p>&#8216;I fear, we&rsquo;re all aware that the situation is getting more tense as the poorest people who need so much are waiting for deliveries. I think tempers might be frayed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;They are scavenging everything. What can you do?,&rsquo; said Michel Legros, 53, as he waited for help to search for seven relatives buried in his collapsed house.</p>
<p>Hard-pressed government workers, meanwhile, were burying thousands of bodies in mass graves.</p>
<p>There is still little sign of many survivors getting aid. No foreign assistance had reached the downtown area of Port-au-Prince, one of the worst-affected areas.</p>
<p>Ordinary Haitians sensed the potential for an explosion of lawlessness. &#8216;We&rsquo;re worried that people will get a little uneasy,&rsquo; said attendant Jean Reynol, 37, explaining his gas station was ready to close immediately if violence breaks out.</p>
<p>&#8216;People who have not been eating or drinking for almost 50 hours and are already in a very poor situation,&rsquo; UN humanitarian spokesman Elisabeth Byrs</p>
<p>&#8216;If they see a truck with something, or if they see a supermarket which has collapsed, they just rush to get something to eat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The quake&rsquo;s destruction of Port-au-Prince&rsquo;s main prison complicated the security situation.</p>
<p>International Red Cross spokesman Marcal Izard said some 4,000 prisoners had escaped and were freely roaming the streets.</p>
<p>&#8216;They obviously took advantage of this disaster,&rsquo; Izard said.</p>
<p>But Byrs said peacekeepers were maintaining security despite the challenges. &#8216;It&rsquo;s tense but they can cope,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>The UN World Food Programme said post-quake looting of its food supplies long stored in Port-au-Prince appears to have been limited, contrary to an earlier report Friday.</p>
<p>It said it would start handing out 6,000 tons of food aid recovered from a damaged warehouse in the city&rsquo;s Cite Soleil slum.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Rome-based agency, Emilia Casella, said the WFP was preparing shipments of enough ready-to-eat meals to feed 2 million Haitians for a month. She noted that regular food stores in the city had been emptied by looters.</p>
<p>It emerged today that desperate Haitians had set up roadblocks of corpses in Port-au-Prince in protest at the lack of emergency aid reaching them after the catastrophic earthquake.</p>
<p>Shaul Schwarz, a photographer for TIME magazine, said he saw at least two blockades formed with bodies of earthquake victims and rocks.</p>
<p>&#8216;They are starting to block the roads with bodies. It&rsquo;s getting ugly out there. People are fed up with getting no help,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Rescue efforts have been blighted by poor infrastructure and lack of heavy lifting equipment  &mdash;  as well as the damage wrought by the disaster.</p>
<p>The humanitarian crisis in the capital is the worst many aid workers have ever seen.</p>
<p>With streets and buildings littered with rotting corpses and filled with the sounds of screams, some have compared it to a scene from hell.</p>
<p>More than 100 paratroopers of the US 82nd Airborne Division arrived at the Port au Prince airport overnight, boosting the U.S. military presence to several hundred on the ground. Others have arrived off Port-au-Prince harbor on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.</p>
<p>Helicopters have been ferrying water and other relief supplies off the Vinson into the airport, US military officials said.</p>
<p>The command said other paratroopers and Marines would raise the U.S. presence to 8,000 troops in the coming days. Their efforts will include providing security, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said.</p>
<p>Hundreds of bodies were stacked outside the city morgue, and limbs of the dead protruded from the rubble of crushed schools and homes.</p>
<p>Experts say people trapped by Tuesday&rsquo;s quake would begin to succumb if they go without water for three or four days.</p>
<p>Haitian President Rene Preval told The Miami Herald that over a 20-hour period, government crews had removed 7,000 corpses from the streets and morgues and buried them in mass graves.</p>
<p>For the long-suffering people of Haiti, the Western Hemisphere&rsquo;s poorest nation, shock was giving way to despair.</p>
<p>&#8216;We need food. The people are suffering. My neighbours and friends are suffering,&rsquo; said Sylvain Angerlotte, 22.</p>
<p>&#8216;We don&rsquo;t have money. We don&rsquo;t have nothing to eat. We need pure water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At Toussaint L&rsquo;Ouverture International Airport, a stream of US military cargo planes was landing Friday, but they had to circle for an hour before getting clearance to land because the quake destroyed the control tower and radar control, and the US military was using emergency procedures.</p>
<p>Aid workers have been blocked by debris on inadequate roads and by survivors gathered in the open out of fear of aftershocks from the 7.0-magnitude quake and re-entering unstable buildings.</p>
<p>&#8216;The physical destruction is so great that physically getting from point A to B with the supplies is not an easy task,&rsquo;  Casella, the WFP spokeswoman in Geneva, said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Estimates of the number of dead vary wildly with some believing as many as 100,000 have been killed.</p>
<p>The Haitian Red Cross said it believed 45,000 to 50,000 people had died and 3 million more  &mdash;  one third of Haiti&rsquo;s population  &mdash;  were injured or left homeless by the 7.0 quake that hit on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Fears were growing today for British woman Ann Barnes, a PA to the UN police commissioner in Haiti.</p>
<p>The headquarters in Port-au-Prince has completely collapsed, killing many who were inside.</p>
<p>Miss Barnes has been missing since the earthquake though the UN have not confirmed that she is among the dead.</p>
<p>In the car park of the capital&rsquo;s L&rsquo;Hopital de la Paix, those awaiting treatment lay among the dead and dying in 90f heat.</p>
<p>A tearful man pointed to his young daughter, her legs broken and face gashed. Her sister had died.</p>
<p>A little boy sobbed among the bodies while two injured women, their legs crushed, propped each other up.</p>
<p>In a makeshift hospital at the Hotel Villa Creole Margaret Germaine-Doillard, a French teacher in her 40s, lay on the ground drifting in and out of consciousness.</p>
<p>She was on a second-floor balcony of her school when the earthquake struck, celebrating a belated Christmas party with more than 300 students and teachers.</p>
<p>There is no way to know how many died at St-Louis de Gonzague, a prestigious Roman Catholic school where some of Haiti&rsquo;s leaders have studied, including former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier.</p>
<p>Germaine-Doillard said she knew of only about 10 students, several teachers and the school&rsquo;s principal who survived.</p>
<p>As she lay in the 80-degree heat, her thoughts remained with her pupils.</p>
<p>&#8216;We couldn&rsquo;t save the students,&rsquo; she murmured. &#8216;We couldn&rsquo;t save the students.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Haiti = Katrina^10.</p>
<p>A few years ago, armed rebels were able to topple, at least for awhile, the legitimate government in Haiti.  They were only armed with machetes.  Evidently, a machete gets you pretty far in Haiti.</p>

		<p>Geologists knew Haiti was in an active situation.  There is thus<br>
far no information that many, if any, Haitians had a &#8220;mind set&#8221;<br>
for the fainter earlier tremors that often permit several seconds  &mdash;  or up to a few dozen seconds  &mdash;  - to seek shelter (under heavy tables, outdoors, etc.) before the massive shocks hit.  While reportedly it has been about 200 years since an equivalent earthquake, an   &#8220;out of sight/ out of mind&#8221; posture seems to have arisen from want of&hellip;.??  <br>

<p>Now might not it be better to call them undocumented parolees, being seismically challenged with a geological &ldquo;right&rdquo; to their freedoms? Come now Comrade Izard, the insinuation that they are &ldquo;escaped prisoners&rdquo; and capitalizing on a disaster, is quite intolerant. </p>

		<p>Well, why are we thinking this is even noteworthy?  This is what always happens when &#8220;people of color&#8221; get impatient when things aren&rsquo;t going as fast as they want it to.  What is going on in Haiti is indeed tragic, but if their guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t had done its job, there would be an infrastructure that would allow trucks etc. to get through with supplies.  This country is worse than many in Africa.  I&rsquo;ve watched, but nobody has mentioned anything about what exactly they&rsquo;re using for &#8220;loos&#8221; over there.  I somehow have a hard time imagining Diane Sawyer squatting over a hole in broad daylight, but given the state of affairs there, she may in fact be doing just that.  And THAT&rsquo;s where the next tragedy will come from - tons of untreated sewage all over the place, breeding God-knows-what types of fatal diseases.  There may be 50,000 dead and dying from the earthquake, but add another 200,000 who will die from disease toot sweet.  I guess if I was Haitian I&rsquo;d grab my machete too - the future does not look all that wonderful for anyone there.  Those rescuers all better have had shots against every communicable disease known!!</p>

		<p>It would be interesting to compare the reaction to the earthquake in Haiti to one in, say, Japan.</p>
<p><i>We don&rsquo;t have money. We don&rsquo;t have nothing to eat. We need pure water.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Ok, assuming that these people were truly isolated from aid workers and could do nothing to help, one could forgive them and have sympathy, but what do we make of this passage:</p>
<p><i>It emerged today that desperate Haitians had set up roadblocks of corpses in Port-au-Prince in protest at the lack of emergency aid reaching them after the catastrophic earthquake.</i></p>
<p>Aside from gross disrespect for the dead and a complete disregard of the risk of pestilence, how could those who have enough energy to pile up dead bodies not have enough energy to help in the relief effort? This is just plain sick. How does blockading the roads help with the relief effort? I would say this is a sign of insanity except for the fact that it is normal Haitian behavior.</p>
<p>Haitians, with their traditions of zombies and voodoo, have long had extremely peculiar beliefs about the dead, to put it kindly. Once again, this is just sick. You can&rsquo;t help people who refuse to help themselves. And we are supposed to want thousands of these people in this country? They will just bring their strange ways, lack of initiative and criminal behavior with them.</p>

		<p>As the events unfold in Haiti and the civil unrest unfolds with the population screaming for the United States to do more and more, even though the USA provides almost 50% of their income, compare the reaction of other places hit by large earthquakes such as the 1964 Alaskan earthquake that was 9-2 to 9-4 on the Richter scale, the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake, and the 2008 Sichuan, China quake that killed around 69,000 people.  You witness order out of chaos, help being provided by their own country, and a rebuilding process.  But in Haiti nothing but riots, crying for aid, and US leaders promising to do more and more for this corrupt country.  Really sick/civil rule disappears if it was even there to start with.</p>

		<p>Thank goodnes that there are still some White countries in existance that can provide help to Haiti.  Imagine a few generations from now, when nearly all of Earth&rsquo;s countries will be composed of primarily Third-World people   &mdash;   when nearly all of the World is similar to Haiti. At that time there will be no help and no mercy.  </p>
<p>Perhaps the Japanese (who strictly limit immigration) or the Chinese (who strictly limit overpopoulation and immigration) will still be able to assist, 50 years from now.</p>

CNN showed a group of people marching and singing in the street and the female host was beside herself with emotion. My thought was &#8216;help the people around you first. Singing in the streets can come later&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Another report showed the roaming bands of machete carrying youths. They didn&rsquo;t look like scavengers. They looked like blood-hungry killers.</p>
<p>Yet another showed a man screaming that &#8216;the government&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t doing anything to help. My thought was &#8216;who does this guy believe the government is and maybe if the people stopped marching and singing, they might do some good helping people&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Of course, then we have the reports of tire fires and piling corpses in the street to protest government inaction. You&rsquo;d think anyone with half a brain would be clearing the streets so relief trucks could come in.</p>

		<p>I look forward to seeing the deadly details in living color on all channels. NOT! </p>
<p>On the bright side, I have read many critical comments about the rush to aid Haiti. Readers of MSM sites are seeing the light, and openly say they prefer charity to stay at home. The racial motive is unstated, yet clear. </p>
<p>The spectacle of African behavior, the need for armed force to restore order, the idiocy behind the chaos, all will seep out like toxic waste. The stench announces itself even now. The full view will follow despite media attempts to spin it as anything but the self-evident.</p>

<p> The population density is 10 times that of America, 20 if you discount the 150 million American immigrants since 1965. In 50 years it will double yet again. </p>

<p>From the <a href="/ar/2007/08/index.html#cover" rel="nofollow">August 2007 American Renaissance cover story:</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps one of the most striking examples of Japanese respect for the law and for each other was the aftermath of the Great Hanshin Earthquake of 1995. This was a major quake that killed more than 6,400 people, and caused property damage worth about 2.5 percent of Japan&rsquo;s gross domestic product that year, making it one of the most costly natural disasters in history. The deaths were not scattered around the country but were concentrated in Kobe, a major port city with a population of 1.5 million. Not only were there no reports of looting, there was a huge outpouring of private and corporate volunteerism, and even the Yamaguchi-gumi yakuza mobilized to help distribute food. There would have been very ugly scenes in any major American city if a disaster killed thousands, paralyzing the authorities.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I have had the same friend and neighbor for over forty years. He has always been more of a practical, can do sort of guy than me. He has this phrase he uses in anger and frustration, about my tendency to sit helplessly, awaiting help from someone or anyone, for something I should be able or willing to do for my self. He calls it, &#8220;But the chain came off!&#8221; <br>
  As I sat watching, I saw tens of thousands of people laying on blankets, doing absolutely nothing more than waiting for someone else to feed them, wash them, stitch them up and clean up the debris etc. And I thought to myself, &#8220;Damn!

 On the opening of the  nightly news channel with Brian Williams, I saw an ALMOST subliminal message that flashed across the screen for a second or even less. It was a Haitian women with  her arms outstretched, head tilted to the side with just a faint trickle of blood coming from her forehead. The imagery of Christ and the crucifixion complete with crown of thorns was blatant, obvious AND, as I realized later,  more than likely staged and set up. Game over folks, I can now pretty much expertly see behind the masquerade&hellip;</p>

		<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m already sick of Haiti, even faster than I got sick of New Orleans (Katrina) and Indonesia (the tsunami). I was far more interested in Biloxi, Mississippi, and what those people did on their own to get to work restoring themselves. </p>
<p>How many more billions of our tax dollars do you figure are going to get dumped into Haiti in order to return the place to the thriving third world slum it once was?</p>
<p>At this point, the best thing that could be shipped to Haiti would be capitalism so that the Western hemisphere&rsquo;s most impoverished, dysfunctional welfare state (next to Detroit) might actually have a chance to become a viable nation.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m afraid is going to happen is that tens of thousands of Haitians will end up in the US - - &ldquo;economic refugees&rdquo; - - where they will be shown the way to the welfare offices, right next to the Democrat voter registration kiosk.</p>
<p><br>
Haiti is being staged very well by the leftist media. </p>
<p>Obama will use Haiti to cut America&rsquo;s throat. Watch and  remember this post when Obama is emptying your 401-K, IRA, retirement plan into a govt annuity - aka a slight variation of social security.</p>

		<p>If you compare this tragedy to the southeast Asian tsunami, an area that was also incredibly poor, you can see the stark difference in behavior from the victims. Though there was a day of mourning for lost loved ones, I remember distinctly that the next day the people worked together to help clear dead bodies and debris. And this happened across the multiple countries affected. Even in Sri Lanka, a country torn by war, the Tamil Tigers put down there arms and helped out with the rebuilding. India even declined our help. I don&rsquo;t remember reading any stories about looting or protesting.</p>
<p>So when I see these stories about Haitians acting indignant because others aren&rsquo;t helping them to their satisfaction, I can only shake my head at their lack of appreciation and sense of entitlement. Though honestly, I didn&rsquo;t expect different from the Haitians.</p>

		<p>The abiding curiosity here is whether there are  sources<br>
 in Haiti at the time who have been able to capture a lot of raw<br>
video footagein in a focused and sustained way as to the apparent  lack of mental capacity of most of the population to know how on their own devices to mitigate their immediate problems.  Enough of such raw film footage in various settings  would amount to a kind of situational IQ assessment (ref. OSS Assessment of Men in WW II ). If properly edited and assembled into a documentary, we&rsquo;d have political tremors.  African IQ is the truth-shaped vaccum of most insightful print reports thus far</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Perhaps one of the most striking examples of Japanese respect for the law and for each other was the aftermath of the Great Hanshin Earthquake of 1995.   &hellip;There would have been very ugly scenes in any major American city if a disaster killed thousands, paralyzing the authorities.&rdquo;<br>

<p>The Japanese city is populated by all the same people, one nation united in its values and sympathies  &hellip; essentially a large extended family, not a hodgepodge of cultures and racial groups laboring under the (officially imposed) ideological delusion that diversity makes them stronger. </p>

Every year, there are reports of a town in the US being obliterated by a tornado.</p>
<p>On the nightly news, they show the white families standing before the empty hole that was once their home, crying that they lost everything. But they always say, &#8216;we&rsquo;re alive, and we&rsquo;re going to rebuild&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And they do. When follow up stories are done, the towns are rebuilt better than they were. Homes with tornado shelters and public building built to tornado proof standards.</p>

<p>Valid and telling observation. Compare the behavior of the victims of Katrina with that of the denizens of several mid-western towns and cities which were devastated by floods shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>There was no looting, no disorder, only a calm and orderly response to a disaster as least as destructive as that occasioned by Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>Though it was reported quietly by the MSM, by comparison with the coverage given Katrina, there appeared to be virtually a self-imposed news blackout on the disastrous mid-western floods.</p>
<p>And of course now there&rsquo;s been a virtual blackout on the explosion in the Houston crime rate since the relocation of thousands of New Orleans area blacks after Katrina.</p>

		<p>Near the end of WWII, the Americans were just starting to capture western Germany.  They would bomb the heck out of a German town/city   &mdash;   literally leveling it, and then a few days latter, invade that destroyed area. As the American soldiers entered some of the destroyed cities, they were stunned to see the German civilians already hard at work sorting the rubble   &mdash;   placing undamaged bricks in one pile, copper pipes in another pile, hinges and door knobs in another pile.  </p>
<p>Here were people, who had just days before been massively bombed, many of their family members (women and children burned to death) and their homes leveled, and yet they were already starting to rebuild.  They did not sit on the ground crying and complaining, but took responsibility for thier own welfare.  </p>
<p>However, these were Europeans, a race of people who excel in accomplishment.  Compare the behavior of these Europeans with the typical behavior of Africans after a disaster, be it in Africa, New Orleans, or Haiti. This is one of the reasons why virtually all African nations, cities, communities, businesses, and schools are utter disasters.  </p>

		<p>   All this is typical black behavior, it doesn&rsquo;t matter where they are in the world, blacks ALL act the same way. Too many people either don&rsquo;t realize this fact, or they choose to ignore it. Blacks don&rsquo;t react the same way as whites would to any given situation. The mentality is different. They act/react on a more emotional basis than do whites. There is no logic/ reasoning involved in their actions. I worked for 35 years with blacks in a midwestern factory, I know how they think. The differences between blacks and whites are starkly evident. We can never co-exist with them in a safe environment. I hate to see anybody suffer, but until they decide to help themselves, nobody else can help them. I will be the first to say, I will not donate a single penny to them. If the situation were reversed, they sure as Hell would not help me.</p>

		<p>Our busybody politicians and do-gooders are talking now about &#8220;rebuilding&#8221; Haiti.</p>
<p>Rebuilt it to WHAT?  That&rsquo;s misleading, since nothing much was there to begin with.  Haiti was never anything but a gigantic slum.</p>
<p>In other words, we&rsquo;re going to end up building for them what they never had in the first place. This is going to be ANOTHER nation-building project!   Just how many of these projects can Uncle Sam handle around the world?  And this with the dollar declining, an enormous national debt, and an international financial crisis to deal with!  Does anybody in Washington stop to think of these things?</p>
<p>And they want to allow the illegal Haitians to remain here (working illegally) so they can continue sending money home to Haiti.  With the dollar in the shape it is, we shouldn&rsquo;t even be allowing remittances out of the country. If we were realistic, that is;  but we&rsquo;re not.  We&rsquo;ll get realistic when the dollar collapses  (and perhaps the government with it),  but that will be too late.

		<p>Talk of the U.S. dollar collapsing has quite a lot of validity in recent times. The Arab oil producing counties (GCC) are NOW working on a plan to make a common dinar for all of the gulf countries AND Iraq! I was told that it would be based on their own value and pegged to the Kuwait dinar (1kd=$3.75) which would effectively destroy our currency. The other possibility suggested to me (by the Kuwaitis) was that the new dinar be pegged to the Chinese yuan (I think that&rsquo;s right spelling)But no consideration of pegging to the U.S. dollar OR the Euro!</p>

<p>This Haiti mess is so huge that it will be too much for American and world do-gooders to take on. The port is wrecked, and everybody has to come in through the airport or overland from the Dominican Republic. All this to feed three million people.

		<p>The UN is largely the problem in Haiti. Any murdering, raping and pillaging &lsquo;machete wielding yoots&rsquo; in NOLA were dispatched forthwith to their maker under Honore, and aid proceeded relatively risk free. Not so in Haiti where the UN will not authorize live fire and huddles at the airport like scared baby mice.</p>
<p>The USAF was at the airport within hours and had flight control established in less than 12 under protection of Marines. The president of Haiti&rsquo;s response to this was to demand a &lsquo;landing tax&rsquo; on relief flights (according to a CNN reporter) and throw a hissy fit over the potential loss of &lsquo;sovereignty&rsquo;. The UN&rsquo;s reaction was to throw a hissy fit over who was &ldquo;officially in control&rdquo;, both wasting precious hours on politics.</p>
<p><br>
ABOARD THE USS CARL VINSON  &mdash;  Helicopters sit ready to go from this US aircraft carrier off Haiti, but there&rsquo;s a problem: after a day of frantic aid runs there is simply nothing left to deliver. <br>
Aboard the warship some 3,500 US military personnel have been coordinating the flights of 19 US helicopters carrying aid since early morning. </p>
<p>SNIP </p>
<p>The commander noted that some supplies remain at the airport, and could easily be delivered by US helicopters. </p>
<p>&#8220;The problem is, some people are perhaps not ready to release their stuff to the most efficient transportation makers and want to deliver supplies themselves.&#8221; </p>

		<p>De Wiley- I&rsquo;m a structural engineer and that is exactly what I saw when I looked at the pictures of the rubble. Very heavy masonry and concrete buildings built over a known fault zone with little or no reinforcing. When the ground moves back and forth, there is no lateral strength to resist the horizontal loads imposed by these heavy structures. Timber buildings would have fared much better. This is basic stuff. What a recipe for disaster. They seem to have no building codes.</p>

		<p>While there was international aid for the Kobe earthquake of 1995, the Japanese would not have sat in the ruins waiting for the world to bring it food and water. They quickly got to work, repaired the damage, and have learned from that quake, which, incidentally, was stronger than the one to hit Haiti, how to build better roads, bridges and buildings. </p>
<p>On a smaller scale, an Amish community that was hit by a tornado would not wait for the Feds to feed and clothe them, but dig themselves out of the mess and rebuild. I have no such expectations that Haitians, with their sense of entitlement, would do the same. </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that the Haitian mess is so huge is the degree of overpopulation and congestion.  If you had a thinly spread out population,  mostly rural, the damage would be much less severe. But the Haitians have overpopulated themselves so much that the entire country  is apparently crammed with humanity, almost like Bangla Desh, wherever there is some level, useful land.</p>
<p>The commander of the USS Vinson, Adm. Branch, said in an interview that they had spent the entire day reconnoitering the land, looking for places where helicopters could land  (to distribute supplies), but the entire coast was so  over-built and congested    that there was almost no place to land a helicopter!   </p>
<p>  <i>&#8220;Most of the rest of the day was spent surveying for helicopter landing spots. Branch, who commands the first major U.S. military operation sent to Haiti since Tuesday&rsquo;s earthquake, faces steep challenges in finding aid delivery sites because of rubble, debris, and the country&rsquo;s mountainous landscape. His 19 helicopters are idle on the flight deck.<br>
  <br>
&#8220;Frankly there&rsquo;s nowhere to put (supplies) down,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Coastal development is pretty dense and we don&rsquo;t want to just drop it out of the helicopter. The landing zones, distribution zones, are in the battered terrain. The mountain areas are going to be much more difficult.&#8221;  </i><br>

		<p>Well, after several days they will certainly be very thirsty and a little hungry, but I saw no one looking really skinny and malnourished as in the african mainland cases such as Rwanda and Biafra. In fact, they must have been getting fed somehow for the past few years and most look extremely fit and well and fully capable of carrying out a hard days work burying the dead, clearing roads, moving rubble, digging latrines and preparing to assist the aid workers in their massive task. Considering the official figures regarding poverty, low annual per-capita income and massive unemployment, they have seemingly done very well from years of foreign aid. So much so that they have obviously got used to hand-outs and have forgotten about daily sweat and toil. I would feed and school the kids but insist that all fit adults put in a hard day carrying out reconstruction work in return for a couple of good meals and tented accommodation but I suppose the queues for hand-outs would be much reduced if this was implemented. After all, it IS their country so they should play the greater part in fixing it and not expect to be flown to other countries as refugees. If they have skills, they will be needed in Haiti and if they haven&rsquo;t, they would only be a welfare burden elsewhere so should be trained at home.</p>

		<p>Dear Yorkshireman, Post 41,</p>
<p>You mentioned latrines.  It is funny that last week I was talking with an idiot liberal who told me that instead of Christmas presents, their family had each given foreign aid gifts to family members.  She literally gushed with pride and excitement at her gift (which she gave to 9 members of her extended family)   &mdash;   money to teach Africans how to build latrines!</p>
<p>I replied, &#8220;Yes, I&rsquo;ve read about that.  In some cases the Europeans come and build the latrines and then as soon as they leave, the Africans go back to just squatting behind the nearest tree.&#8221;  There was a long pause followed by a nervous laugh by the lady.  I let it drop after that.    </p>

<p>Yes, Africans excel at irresponsible breeding.  They start young, before they have any means of supporting offspring.  They bread often and everywhere and with any partner, and then refuse to support the offspring.  We see this in America, where ~70% of Black children are born out-or-wedlock, and an additional 60% of the remaining are left with only one (or no) parent within 10 years.  This is a genetic-life-history strategy evolved in tropical Africa, where food, water, &amp; good climate are available all year long.  Under those conditions, survival does not require a nuclear family and prudent (spaced) reproduction.  Instead, the best strategy is to produce as many babies as fast as possible with as  many women as possible and hope that a few of them survive.  The problem is that in a European-derived society, the African strategy will flourish, because the Europeans will care for and raise the excess African babies (while also raising their own White children).  Today, a typical middle-class White American family is (on average) raising 1.6 of their own children, and also 1 minority child (via taxes and social welfare).  This is why Europeans cannot allow their homelands to be swamped by Africans.   </p>

<p>This Haiti mess is so huge that it will be too much for American and world do-gooders to take on. The port is wrecked, and everybody has to come in through the airport or overland from the Dominican Republic. All this to feed three million people.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re referring to all of Haiti, it&rsquo;s much more than this.  The population of Haiti is over 10 million.</p>

The problem is also they have absolutely no timber left on the island. The entire island cooks food every single day with wood/charcoal and has thus deforested the entire Haitian side of hispanol which is now brown and barren compared to lush green Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Years ago the UN tried to get them to use free cans of basically sterno cooking fuel but the Haitians widely refused since they thought the food didn&rsquo;t taste as good.</p>
<p>The Haitians have simply outgrown their tiny nation and only so many of them can sneak into the US. The only way the place will ever not be a basket case if someone forcibly prevents them from their continued rampant unchecked overbreeding, make one day the Chinese will do something.</p>

<p>  Your completely right. I think we could have a similar massive breakdown of civil order in any of our minority majority cities under similar circumstances.

We have a society of mean IQ 72  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s 72.  If the top 15% or so of 85-100( dull normal in our Bell Curve ) have a fighting chance THEMSELVES  to survive in extreme conditons how is<br>
the ugly raw fact of robbing and dispossesing a Retarded remaining population especially surprising in such extremes?  Would we expect a suicidal brotherhood ethic?  Isn&rsquo;t civilized morality dependent upon a higher mean IQ Or upon a kind despot? Realism re Haitian IQ  seems not to allow pleasant options.</p>

		<p>I was watching the 10 oclock news a few years ago (Oakland, CA), and on it a reporter said that the population of Haiti was 8 milion, and only 40 years ago it was 2 million(that is how many Haitians have emigrated to the US over the years). What will it be in 40 years from now, at that rate?Haiti will NEVER be a viable nation because it is populated by Africans that have a mentality and temperment  straight out of the African jungle.WHY doesnt anyone have the courage to get up and say this?Because if they did, thay would immediately be beaten to death with the Race Card by White Marxiststs and Black Racists.</p>

		<p>I have read the comments in the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; Times Online and they are really hardcore down on the Haitians. I was sort of shocked. One poster said more or less what do you expect? There are 9.8 million paupers on an island which can maybe support 300,000 given a functioning economy.<br>
I have a feeling that no matter how strident the leftist media get the word is out that Haiti is dead and gone.<br>

of this&hellip;like what happened in New Orleans a few years ago perhaps it will be another wake up call to those of us <br>
who carry the `white mans burden` of the absolute hoplessnss and helplessness of Africans in the face of any disaster and their 100% reliance on overseas aid,which overwhelmingly comes from  US,Europe and a few advanced Asian countries.  <br>
If there is anything that can give us all a  racial reality check,the converted Amreners and their ilk and the unconverted<br>
`blind freddy` liberals alike, its what is happening in Haiti and in any black dominated area when a disaster strikes.   <br>
 I will look forward to seeing what happens when half of Haiti<br>
decides to emigrate en masse to the US etc  like what we are seeing with an exploding population of Sub Saharan Africans looking to get to Europe at any cost.Whether we can hold back the floodgates and avoid this doomsday type scenario remains to be seen.Hopefully I am not the hargbinger of doom a la pre<br>

<p>The way things have historically worked in Haiti, is the dictators have relied on shock troops called the &#8220;Tonton Macoute&#8221; essentially Haiti&rsquo;s version of the brown shirts. They typically were not so much actually employed as they were given carte blanch to steal, plunder, loot and rape at their heart&rsquo;s content, instead of drawing a paycheck you just go out looting. In return they of course had to support their masters to the death and kill their foes.</p>
<p>These people never really went away (the &#8220;democratic&#8221; Aristide relied on hearty doses of bloody repression) and these people are used to simply committing acts of horrific violence to make the government give them whatever they want.</p>

<p>You say  that  out-of-wedlock birth in the African American  community  is  ~70%.

<p>&#8220;Haiti is being staged very well by the leftist media. <br>
Obama will use Haiti to cut America&rsquo;s throat. Watch and remember this post when Obama is emptying your 401-K, IRA, retirement plan into a govt annuity - aka a slight variation of social security.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
The Obama administration appears to have come up with a novel way of financing trillion-dollar budget deficits – demanding IRA and 401(k) holders buy trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds. </p>
<p>With the Treasury needing this year to see another $1 trillion in debt to finance the anticipated federal budget deficit, and the Federal Reserve about to discontinue its 2009 program of buying Treasury bonds for the Fed&rsquo;s asset portfolio, the Obama administration is scrambling to find ways to sell government debt without having to raise interest rates. </p>
<p>Bloomberg reported Friday that Assistant Labor Secretary Phyllis C. Borzi and Deputy Assistant Treasury Mark Iwry are planning to stage a public comment period before implementing regulations that would require private investors to structure IRA and 401(k) accounts into what could amount to a U.S. Treasury debt-backed government annuity. </p>
<p>CNBC&rsquo;s Rick Santelli broadcast the rumor the same day from the trading floor during CNBC&rsquo;s &#8220;Power Lunch&#8221; show. </p>
<p>Spokesmen from both the U.S. Treasury and Department of Labor confirmed to WND that the federal agencies about to enter a pre-regulation public comment phase on the proposed rule change. </p>
<p>snip </p>
<p>A survey conducted by the Investment Company Institute showed more than 70 percent of all households disagreed with the idea of requiring retirees to buy annuities with a portion of their assets, whether the annuity is offered by an insurance company or by the government. </p>
<p>Moreover, 96 percent of households in the survey responded that retirees rejected the idea that the government should mandate turning IRA or 401(k) assets into annuities, asserting instead that retirees should make their own decisions about managing retirement assets and income.</p>
