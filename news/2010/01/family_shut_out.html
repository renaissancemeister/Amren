			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Wilkes and Nick Mcdermott, Daily Mail (London), January 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><br>
With the building works nearly over, Julian and Samantha Mosedale and their three children were looking forward to moving back into the home of their dreams.</p>
<p>But their hopes have turned into a nightmare because a group of Romanians occupied the property over Christmas.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, police told them that they were being &#8216;racist&rsquo; for questioning the squatters&rsquo; right to live in Britain on benefits.</p>
<p>Julian and Samantha Mosedale with their children Finn, Jake and Toby (left to right) had hoped to move back into their &#8216;dream home&rsquo; in March</p>
<p>Locked out: Julian and Samantha Mosedale with their children Finn, Jake and Toby (left to right) had hoped to move back into their &#8216;dream home&rsquo; in March</p>
<p>The unwanted guests have changed the locks at the three-bedroom terrace house and moved in their own furniture.</p>
<p>Mr Mosedale, an illustrator, and his wife, a catalogue manager, both 45, had moved out of the house in Tottenham, North London, in July 2007 for extensive structural and renovation work.</p>
<p>They rented another property and regularly visited the £285,000 house to oversee progress.</p>
<p>But, after spending Christmas visiting relatives in Essex, they returned to the house on January 3 to find the squatters installed.</p>
<p>They now fear they could soon be homeless because they can only afford to foot the cost of rent and mortgage payments until March.</p>
<p>Mrs Mosedale, whose three sons are ten, eight, and five, said: &#8216;We called the police as soon as we found out they were in there. An officer suggested I was racist when I asked if they were Romanians, and did they have a legal right to be in this country.</p>
<p> &#8216;We are hard-working citizens yet get treated like criminals when our home is stolen. This whole thing is making me feel constantly sick. All we want to do is get on with our lives.</p>
<p>&#8216;We feel let down by the law, by government, and by the police, in fact all the authorities that one would expect to protect society.</p>
<p>&#8216;The house had builders in it while the renovations were being done. It was only in the last couple of months that it was left completely empty.</p>
<p>&#8216;Our lawyers don&rsquo;t know how long it will take us to get them out and the stress is really getting to the whole family.</p>
<p>&#8216;The kids are upset at the idea that other children are playing with their toys in the garden.</p>
<p>&#8216;Our son Jake is old enough to understand what is going on and he is finding it difficult to sleep.</p>
<p>&#8216;All the children are incredibly unsettled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Mosedale&rsquo;s house in Tottenham where squatters have moved in</p>
<p>Target: The £285,000 Mosedale&rsquo;s house. When the family questioned the squatters&rsquo; right to be in Britain, police told them that they were being &#8216;racist&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yesterday, the couple obtained a county court order giving the squatters 24 hours  &mdash;  until 2.15pm today  &mdash;  to leave.</p>
<p>But Mr Mosedale fears they will not give in easily.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;When the papers were served on them they tore them up and threw them back at the guy who&rsquo;d taken them round.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He and his wife are also worried that a drawn-out battle would exhaust their savings. They had planned to move back into the house in March.</p>
<p>Mrs Mosedale said: &#8216;We were in the process of creating our dream home and it has been ruined.</p>
<p>&#8216;At the moment there are at least four women, four children and one man living in our home, but neighbours said they have seen many more people going in and out.</p>
<p>&#8216;In the meantime we face the prospect of becoming homeless ourselves, since we had only budgeted to pay both rent and our mortgage until mid March.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Two sisters, Mihaela and Luminitsa Vaduva, are staying in the house with their seven children.</p>
<p>Speaking broken English, Luminitsa said: &#8216;I don&rsquo;t understand the problem. We have paid for this home. If they move us out, then my children will not have a home.</p>
<p>&#8216;We are from Romania, we have no money for another home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She showed a tenancy agreement but could not provide a contact number for the landlord or say when they had moved in.</p>

		<p>Why aren&rsquo;t the gypsies arrested?  How can a country call itself civilized if a person can not move out of their home to have it renovated or to go on Christmas vacation?  What about property rights?  Does the British government require someone to be in the home 24/7 to retain ownership?  And what do you want to bet that after the courts do, after a long period of time, evict the gypsies, after having bankrupted the Mosedales of course, that the home isn&rsquo;t destroyed and in need of a second rehabilitation?<br>

		<p>Can&rsquo;t they go to the proper authorities with their mortgage papers and show them that the house belongs to them? I do not see how it is racist to try to get someone out of your house that is occupying it illegally in the first place. I also do not see how the squatters are saying that they &#8220;paid for&#8221; the house? I would assume that there is a title on file with the local authorities.</p>
<p>We had a similar situation here about 5 years ago when we rented a room in our basement to a huge, overbearing Hispanic man. When we asked him to move out with a proper notice he said that we were going to have to take him to court. We filed the proper paperwork with the court and he promptly took off to parts unknown leaving his stuff and coming back every few days so we could not say that he had abandoned the room. Finally after not being able to serve him with papers the Sheriff&rsquo;s deputy who had been chasing him told us to change the locks which we did. Long story short we got rid of him but not after a threatening letter from an attorney and court administrators stating &#8220;mr ____ is being thrown out of his home&#8221; </p>

		<p>I recently read a very smug, supposedly Academic, article stating that the commonly-held belief, that Gypsies originated in India, was completely false.  The article went on to say there were no genetic links to India&hellip;</p>
<p>Thank you for including the photo of the Gypsy squatter.  It proves to me that the article I describe was pure bunk.  Academia can no longer be trusted to adhere to even the most rudimentary standards regarding truth and objectivity.  That man looks like he just flew in from Mumbai.</p>

<p>Sad but true.  Such is dispossession, and rarely is it more personal than in this story.</p>
<p>If it were my home, I&rsquo;d drive them out by force - with guns if necessary.  If you can&rsquo;t defend your own home, then what good are laws?</p>

		<p>Not only is the Daily Mail, among others, using &#8220;Romanian&#8221; or &#8220;Roma&#8221; in place of &#8220;Gypsy,&#8221; they are now spelling the latter as &#8220;gipsy,&#8221; presumably to avoid the prefix &#8220;gyp.&#8221; </p>
<p>Take a look at the Daily Mail article posted on the Jan. 13 AR listings. The article about the man arrested for an alleged anti-Gypsy email written by somebody else consistently spells it &#8220;gipsy.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I had to look up &#8220;squatters&#8221; in Wikipedia because it was hard for me to fathom how someone could effectively &#8220;evict&#8221; the rightful owners of a home through a tangle of legal paperwork, and that seems to be exactly what was done here. Unsurprisingly, Wikipedia took a sympathetic view of squatters, quoting a long paragraph from an &#8220;anarchist&#8221; claiming that squatting is a god-given right and property ownership is itself invalid! With so much excuse-making for squatting I can now see why it happens.</p>

		<p>Most groups of people at least produce a few members of some merit but I have not seen this with Gypsies. I&rsquo;m an admitted racist but I have seen honest and hard working black people but I have never seen a Gypsy that was of any good character what-so-ever. </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t hold your breath.  Most of them probably know the difference; they don&rsquo;t want to get over the confusion.  After all, it&rsquo;s not &#8220;politically correct&#8221; to point out the obvious differences between races and ethnic groupings.  </p>
<p>Here in Zoo York City, I live not too far from a small community of Romanians (I should say, REAL Romanians!), and you&rsquo;re right: the better part of them are hard-working, law-abiding people.  I&rsquo;ve also had the displeasure in my life of living near Gypsies (I REFUSE to call them &#8220;Roma&#8221;; they have NOTHING to do with Rome!).  Anyway, given my experiences with them, I would have much rather lived near a rat&rsquo;s nest.<br>

<p>   I dislike the attempt by the controlled media to portray gypsies as Romanians. They are a distinct people and should be accorded recognition as such. After all, shouldn&rsquo;t they be proud of who they are?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d tell the Mosedales to take the &#8216;Pacific Heights&rsquo; movie approach but that would make the gypsies love the place even more.</p>
<p>As for gypsies&hellip; I used to live in an apartment below gypsies.  It was a very nice apartment in a great section of Queens, NY.  They were car thieves (it is fairly well known in NYC that gypsies have a racket tunneling stolen cars between New York and Philadelphia).  They were selling the things right out on the street in front of our building.  It was only one or two cars at a time, but I was suspicious from the getgo.  However, when a frail, elderly white man came by asking about the people in that apartment because he was unable to get a hold of them and could not register the car because the VIN# on the vehicle was either reported stolen or did not exist (don&rsquo;t remember).  Several days later they abandoned the apartment in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Gypsies are gypsies no matter where they are and Americans should be so naive to believe we don&rsquo;t have our own problem with Gypsies!!!<br>

		<p>Roma, travellers and gypsies had themselves declared a seperate race by the European Courts, nobody forced them to do it but it has many benefits. It is illegal in UK to ask about a person&rsquo;s racial identity as this, in itself, can be classed as racist. The big mistake made by the Mosedale family was to involve the police who will look for the easiest target to create a crime report. This will never be against any ethnic minority as our wonderful scottish communist labour party is totally against anything remotely English, White and Christian. These squatters will now be protected by Trevor Phillips, the black Minister for Racial Equality whose entire staff is black or ethnic minority and the evil racist homeowner will continue to be vilified by the powers that be. Meanwhile, the police will have been instructed to park outside the house to prevent the lawful owners from gaining possession as so commit a racial hate crime. These squatters will now wreck the house, burn all furniture and fittings to provide heat and the Mosedale family will never be able to prove this as the immigrants will claim &#8216;it was like that when we got here&rsquo;. It beggars belief that the the electric power and water cannot legally be turned off and all consumption must be paid for by the rightful owners. When the immigrants are eventually evicted, they will claim they are homeless and be housed by the local authority at public expense, never having to work and be paid various child and unemployment cash benefits. American AMRENER&rsquo;s may not believe any of this but UK readers will be able to confirm my allegations.</p>

<p>That indeed is anarchy.  Without property ownership, anyone could similarly evict the gypsies, and so on, ad infinitum.  (Of course, the building wouldn&rsquo;t exist in the first place.)</p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t think of a better place for this to happen than the UK. <br>
The people in England have been living in a suicidal mode for years and they deserve this idiocy. And why is everyone there so afraid of this word &#8220;racist?&#8221; Is being considered a racist by some idiot really all that important? If I were the homeowner I would hire a gang of thugs to beat the stuffings out of these people and then dump them somewhere. This would teach future squatters a lesson. </p>
<p>And by the way, the cop that called the homeowner a racist should be thrown off the police force for acting like a moron.</p>

		<p>Multiculturalism is sociologically a parallel to the AIDS virus in that in cases like this it attempts to completely disable the social immune system of legitimate higher culture to exist (particularly whites). Multiculturalism attacks higher human organic identities at the root of their being, dismantling the inborn reflexes of self preservation by labeling them (hate crimes, thought crimes, racial crimes..etc.) In this bizarre paradigm&hellip; the accomplished races are deemed a virus and the multicult virus&hellip; deemed the cure* What the true origin of Gypsies and the like are IS important in the universal scheme of justice and I&rsquo;m not sure if their low station in society is their karma or injustices done them by others of superior station in earlier history. But its hard for me to not see them as having brought this on themselves more than others having done this to them*</p>

		<p>They are essentially Punjabis, with some possible other Indian admixture.</p>
<p>Even Indians would concede that that is public knowledge.</p>

		<p>This makes me furious. The innocent British family is actualy BILLED for the utilities that the Gypsy squatters are using, as well as locked out of their own home! The family that owns the property should take the city of Tottenham, North London to court for what the authorities allow to go on happening to their home. Violence will just play into the hands of the Gypsy community and the police who protect these criminals at the expense of the good people that are being hurt by them. One thing that might work right away would be to set up a protest in front of their own home with signs and someone on the scene 24 hours a day. No shouting or confrontations, just a presence. The time for more forward behavior, as the British call it, has not yet arrived, for now.</p>

		<p>And by the way, the cop that called the homeowner a racist should be thrown off the police force for acting like a moron.</p>
<p>Who says they&rsquo;re acting?</p>

		<p>Same thing happens down here in Spain. We have had gypsies for CENTURIES in this country and this is the result:</p>

<p>This is the best exemple that no matter how many progressive policies you apply, gypsies shall always be gypsies. Do Amish need integration policies? NO they work their land hard and demand anything but freedom of religion.</p>
<p>However, romanian gypsies are newcomers in the county. They have suceed in gaining the &#8220;worst race&#8221; ever ranking (above latinos, muslims, etc..). And they also DO squatting </p>

		<p>#31- Cotton. Muslim is not a race&hellip; it&rsquo;s a religion. The overwhelming majority of Muslims, though, are Arabs. Arabs are (despite what the US government declares), a race of people. And I do work with a guy from Bulgaria and another guy from neighboring Romania. They both claim that probably 70% of Gypsies will not work and be productive in European society. They are what the poor blacks have contributed to the American landscape. Not a lot. </p>

		<p>Gypsies in Turkey are as bad as here and there. They are famous for child abuse and kidnapping, underage marriages and of course thievery. My mother always scared me that a Gypsy woman would kidnap me if I wouldn&rsquo;t stay calm when I was a child.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, one of them tried to smoke (it&rsquo;s forbidden) inside a cafeteria in a Western Turkish city. He was stopped and ousted by the owner but after a few days he attacked with his comrades back.</p>
<p>As revenge, people gathered and destroyed Gypsy neighborhood a bit outside the city. They were resettled in some town by the state, of course at the expense of taxpayers&hellip;</p>

		<p>To end the confusion I always use the traditional spelling Rumania. I beleive Roma are vagabonds to traipsed over from India centuries ago, spreading their enriching culture.</p>
