<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/jan/28/bnp-race">BNP Given Last Chance to Make Equality Change to Constitution</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Taylor, Guardian (London), January 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The British National party was warned tonight that it had one last chance to scrap its constitution or face legal action under equality laws.</p>
<p>Its leader, Nick Griffin, was told at a Central London county court session that new rules must be agreed at an extraordinary general meeting to be held next month.</p>
<p>The judgment saw BNP officials forced to rush out letters to members to alert them to the proposed changes.</p>
<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission, which challenged the whites-only membership criteria last year, said the changes proposed still fell foul of equality laws.</p>
<p>John Wadham of the EHRC said the amended version, which refers repeatedly to &#8220;indigenous British&#8221;, displayed indirect discrimination as opposed to direct discrimination. &#8220;It is not that much of an improvement,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Judge Paul Collins said: &#8220;I&rsquo;m going to give the BNP an opportunity to have its EGM and take into account what has been said today and get it right. I do not think there will be another opportunity to get it right. This is it.&#8221; He also ordered the BNP to pay the £12,500 in court costs relating to the adjourned session.</p>
<p>A BNP spokesman Simon Darby said the party would have to &#8220;emasculate its constitution and drop its policies and principles&#8221; to comply with the court&rsquo;s wishes. &#8220;This is a deadly serious attempt to put us out of business,&#8221; said Darby.</p>
<p>Simon Assaf, 41, from Unite Against Fascism, said he was grabbed round the throat and kicked after shouting &#8220;dirty racist&#8221; at Griffin outside the court.</p>
<p>Darby said BNP members had the right to protect themselves when attacked if the police failed to intervene.<br>

		<p>Ameicans cannot presume to tell the BNP how to behave, but we can point out that LePen allows minorities in his organization. In any country there may be a very few enlightened minorities who accept white &amp; European civilization. What does it hurt to let them join? The phrase &#8220;we have to pick our fights&#8221; comes to mind. Why waste millions on litigation? It seems to play into the hands of the diversity advocates.</p>

<p>Oh what a pity that is Comrade Assaf, enough said!</p>
<p>Next:</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Wadham of the EHRC said the amended version, which refers repeatedly to &lsquo;indigenous British&rsquo;, displayed indirect discrimination as opposed to direct discrimination. &lsquo;It is not that much of an improvement,&rsquo; he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The BNP should put whatever language these fools want into their constitution, what will it change if they do and they eventually gain power in the UK. Unless I am honestly missing something here legally in British party politics, what is a constitution but a piece of meaningless paper anyway when there is no intention to really enforce it. The British people know what the BNP stands for (an all white UK) and that is why they are voting for them in greater numbers every election.</p>
<p>What they really need to be ever more resolved to do, is to seek retribution on these Reds once they are in power. That is if they do get them down, kick them and keep on kicking them until they are forever out!</p>

		<p>When is the EHRC going after the Catholic Church about admitting women priests? How did it get decided that the BNP should be hounded first before the Catholic Church? What about religions that teach against gays and abortion? Both are legal activities and law-abiding citizens shouldn&rsquo;t be made to feel shame about legal activities. What about organizations that put shame on cigarette smokers, which is also a legal activity? Personally, I&rsquo;ve been discriminated against by Muslims who take exception to my being an atheist. And I don&rsquo;t like it when other religions say there is something wrong or dirty about me eating beef, pork, or shellfish. The number of ways that citizens can be discriminated against is very long indeed.</p>
<p>What does the EHRC recommend be done with foreign countries, like Canada and Australia, that do indeed recognize indigenous populations? These countries have consular offices in Britain and diplomats interract with British citizens. Maybe an official British protest and threat of sanctions should be put forward by the EHRC?</p>
<p>Try as they might, there is no way the EHRC can avoid the accusation of being selective in who they prosecute.  </p>

<p>I agree with you 100%. I do wonder. . as the controversy continues. . when the BNP does finally give in. . it might make the BNP seem respectable, and a full member of parliament, after being punished and being made to toe-the-line. </p>

		<p>Sounds like the BNP is no longer an annoyance but has become a real threat since they picked up two European Seats.  They are now a legitimate party and not a fringe party. This makes the liberal elites very happy and so they are reaching into their bag of dirty tricks to try to slow the BNP rise in popularity.</p>
<p>Though this will cost the BNP some funding to fight for their right of free association in court; at the same time it provides lots of free advertising.  I predict the BNP will use the spotlight to good advantage.  It is apparent to everyone that the BNP is gaining strength and will probably for the first time gain two seats in parliament in the next General Election which is expected soon.</p>
<p>Nick Griffin and the BNP leadership are quite good at taking the hard shots from the elites and turning these events into good advertising.  They have overcome lots of low blows from the media and these lies are starting to lose their effect.</p>
<p>If I was Labor party leader or member I would be ashamed of the dirty tricks they have thrown at the BNP which has basically made them stronger and more resilient. </p>

		<p>If the EHRC is going to make a mockery of justice then the BNP should make a mockery of the EHRC by officially changing their constitution to &#8220;A Few of My Favorite Things&#8221; from The Sound of Music.</p>
<p>Some of the people reading this comment may think this crazy. But hear me out. It&rsquo;s an outrage that the BNP constitution should be dictated. And nothing the BNP does is going to satisfy the EHRC. They&rsquo;ll just come back next year with more demands. So the BNP might as well nip this in the bud and tell them to suck a lemon at the same time. Besides, it shows a lot more strength than being forced to water down their own constitution. And by changing it to &#8220;A Few of My Favorite Things&#8221; they can still keep their old constitution as de facto and everyone would know it. But if they adopted a watered down version of their constitution then they&rsquo;d have to use it. And then they&rsquo;d just be attacked again next year.</p>
<p>PS- It doesn&rsquo;t have to be &#8220;A Few of Their Favorite Things&#8221;. The BNP could use their imagine and come up with something else. I think &#8220;Their Finest Hour&#8221; by Churchill fit the circumstances and sends a message.</p>

		<p>The BNP should simply find a few token minorities.  Heck, pay them if necessary.  The liberals have been using token minorities for their own purposes for half a century.  Nationalists should be able to do this just as well.</p>

		<p> England&rsquo;s traditional right of Freedom of Association was lost some time ago. I think it is useless for the BNP to try to keep its &#8220;whites only&#8221; membership. This gives the privileged elite the excuse they need to outlaw the BNP.  Reluctantly, I advise giving in to these unjust demands.</p>

		<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t believe that minorities are clammering to enter the BNP.  An equality clause to their charter will not change the present racial composition of its membership.</p>

		<p>As a member and supporter of the British National Party it is pleasant indeed to read the comments after the series of dirty tricks and downright lies put forward by our enemies.  Yes, the proposed changes put forward by Trevor Phillips, the head of the EHCR ( formerly Race Relations Board )who is on around 100,000 GBP per annum, is just a way of forcing the BNP to dig deep in terms of legal costs.  There are many - about 50 plus, after a quick count with no doubt many more - organisations in the UK ( mostly funded by the poor bloody taxpayer ) who simply do not admit whites.  Will Phillips go after them  ?  Don&rsquo;t be silly.  Phillips is a black supremacist.</p>

<p>Why should they have to mention &#8220;whites&#8221; at all? That is proving to be a serious impediment, and could be their ruin.  Why don&rsquo;t they just say &#8220;native British&#8221;,  or &#8220;British descent&#8221;?  That should take care of it. Specifying &#8220;white&#8221; is unnecessary.</p>
