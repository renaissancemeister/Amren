<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Justice Department told the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights to drop dead yesterday. {snip} The department&rsquo;s intransigence should frighten Congress because Justice is asserting broad privileges that undermine congressional authority to oversee government&rsquo;s executive branch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the timing is propitious today for the House Judiciary Committee to consider, and approve, a resolution of inquiry introduced by Rep. Frank Wolf, Virginia Republican. The Wolf resolution would direct Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to &#8220;transmit to the House of Representatives, not later than 14 days after the date of adoption of this resolution, copies of any document, memo or correspondence of the Department of Justice with regard to United States v. New Black Panther Party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Democrats tempted to kill this resolution today on a party-line vote should understand that they would be setting a precedent with ramifications far beyond this case. The constitutional balance of powers would be fundamentally shifted away from Congress to an unaccountable executive, and future corruption easily could go unchecked.</p>
<p>The Commission on Civil Rights, acting according to explicit statutory authority to subpoena executive departments, demanded that Justice answer 49 detailed questions, with accompanying document requests. In yesterday&rsquo;s response, the department wrote that on the basis of seven distinct claimed &#8220;privileges,&#8221; it objects &#8220;to each and every Interrogatory and Document Request.&#8221; The cover letter to the commission from Justice official Joseph H. Hunt asserts a broader need to &#8220;protect against disclosures that would .&nbps;.&nbsp;. undermine its ability to carry out its mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not even President Nixon at the nadir of Watergate asserted such a broad privilege against outside review. Sustaining such a privilege would let an executive agency assert that anything it self-defines as its &#8220;mission&#8221; would be immune from scrutiny. That way lies tyranny.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They are relying on privileges that the Office of Legal Counsel says do not exist,&#8221; Mr. Carvin [Michael Carvin, deputy assistant attorney general for both the Civil Rights Division and the Office of Legal Counsel under President Reagan] asserted. &#8220;There is no privilege, for instance, saying that the Justice Department will not identify personnel working on the case.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Generally, a number of these privileges [are ones] I&rsquo;ve literally never heard of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Carvin specifically noted, contrary to Justice claims, &#8220;Normally there is no general attorney-client privilege unless you are dealing with the president. {snip}&#8221;</p>

						<p>
							<i>Jerry Seper, Washington Times, January 13, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The Justice Department refused Tuesday to turn over most of the information and documents sought by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights explaining why a civil complaint was dismissed against members of the New Black Panther Party who disrupted a Philadelphia polling place in the November 2008 elections.</p>
<p>In a 38-page response, the department objected  &mdash;  except for a few court records, letters and procedural documents  &mdash;  to &#8220;each and every&#8221; question and document request submitted by the commission, saying the subpoenas violated existing executive orders, privacy and privilege concerns, and were burdensome, vague and ambiguous.</p>
<p>The lengthy response, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Times, also said the requested information and documents were protected by the attorney-client privilege or were not subject to disclosure because they included attorney or law enforcement work products.</p>
<p>The department also refused to release any information about an investigation of the New Black Panther Party case by its office of professional responsibility, saying the ongoing review was privileged information or was covered by the Privacy Act.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Commissioner Todd Gaziano, an independent appointed by the House, questioned the department&rsquo;s refusal to turn over the bulk of the requested information and documents.</p>
<p>&#8220;The department offered no arguments as to their legal position in denying the requests,&#8221; Mr. Gaziano said during an interview Tuesday. &#8220;This is just more delay, more stonewalling and without any justification.</p>
<p>&#8220;The department has no privilege in this matter other than executive privilege, and if the president wants to assert it, he should do so,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Civil Rights Commission, frustrated by the Justice Department&rsquo;s failure to explain the dismissal despite repeated written requests for information, issued subpoenas on Dec. 9 demanding records showing how the case was handled.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The commission had sought answers from the Justice Department on why a civil complaint against the New Black Panther Party and three of its members was dismissed after a federal judge in Philadelphia had ordered default judgments in the case.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The growing controversy is over a voter-intimidation case involving the radical New Black Panther Party and why Justice is carrying water for the villains.&#8221;</p>
<p>This situation might involve a controversy, but it certainly isn&rsquo;t a mystery as to why it is occurring.  This pro-black community organizer desired to be president so he could do everything in his power to advance blacks and their agenda.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s overlooking Henry Gates&rsquo; loud, out of control attitude, which caused him to be arrested, or excusing Black Panthers from threatening white citizens at the polls, all of it is part of the unspoken revelation that &#8220;we&rsquo;re in power now, and it&rsquo;s payback time for all the ills that whites wrought upon us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, the &#8220;ills&#8221; they refer to amount to paranoid black fantasies about destroying N.O. and introducing aids and drugs into black neighborhoods, and probably at least a thousand other distortions about what blacks believe whites are doing to them, plus the notion that blacks are just as smart as whites and would be just as successful, but they&rsquo;ve been held back and oppressed for 400 years.</p>
<p>Just look at the way the Obamanation came out immediately voicing abnormal concern over the victims of the eartquake in Haiti.  If the inhabitants had been white it would have taken him longer than the three days it took for him to address the nation on the crotch bomber, which he DIDN&rsquo;T want to address at all, because the perp was black.</p>
<p>The black community&hellip;for the most part&hellip;are all Reverend Jeremiah Wrights.  There&rsquo;s no difference.  They&rsquo;re a bunch of incompetent ingrates who blame all their inabilities and inadequacies as stemming from some kind of imaginary injustice committed against them by whites.</p>
<p>The basis for these beliefs can be attributed to white leftist loonies and black liars and agitators throughout the black community.  They assure blacks that we&rsquo;re all equal in every way and the only reason whites succeed and blacks fail is due to white oppression, racism and treachery.</p>
<p>Had the truth been told all these many years instead of this game of &#8220;let&rsquo;s pretend blacks are smart,&#8221; a good number of blacks would realize that they&rsquo;re not only behind whites they&rsquo;re behind every other race as well, and even though they probably wouldn&rsquo;t agree openly with that assessment just the mere utterance of it would be enough to shut them up, and we wouldn&rsquo;t be having so much trouble with their sick, twisted, paranoid minds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned a lot about how the declining economy is leading us to collapse and break up, and I&rsquo;m 99% sure that&rsquo;s going to occur.  However, I can&rsquo;t shake the feeling that this pro-black community organizer is going to start an explosive conflagration<br>
of some kind in addition to the financial calamity almost upon us.</p>
<p>I get the feeling that he is quietly forming ties and implementing his civilian army &#8220;that will be as well-funded and as strong as the military,&#8221; as he has mentioned several times.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure the Black Panthers; Acorn; the Black Muslims and black street gangs are going to be a part of that army.<br>

		<p>Ranger&rsquo;s closing comment makes reference to Obama&rsquo;s strange and repeated comments about a civilian police force, which he made repeatedly during his rather incoherent campaign.</p>
<p>In that we already have a federal police force in the FBI, TSA, as well as state and local police forces, I can only assume that Obama means that we need some sort of KGB/GRU force to maintain surveillance on every activity of the private citizens of America.</p>
<p>Needless to say, had John McCain (admittedly a man of High Doltage) made such a statement, he rightly would have been shouted right out of his candidacy.  But Obama was allowed to make such provocative statements without even a demand for clarification.</p>
<p>This evil man is a hard-core communist, with every intention of imposing a communist dictatorship on this country. Anybody who thinks otherwise simply hasn&rsquo;t listened to what he&rsquo;s been saying.</p>
<p>Though it&rsquo;s highly doubtful that he&rsquo;ll succeed, the damage he&rsquo;s inflicting on our economy and democracy will be very hard to repair.  The most likely outcome is that the nation will break apart, as did the former USSR.  And that very likely will be a good thing.</p>

		<p>Ranger, your comment should be on the front page of every major newspaper in this country!  If people don&rsquo;t think the majority of blacks hate whites and want payback, go to Youtube and look up any black-related or race-related video, and you&rsquo;ll see &#8220;crackers&#8221; or &#8220;devils&#8221; and every word they type is about getting retribution from whites.  I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s going to take to get most whites to pull their head out of the sand and drop this white guilt.   This is NOT the time for a guilt trip, my friends!</p>

<p>I agree with the poster &#8220;ranger&#8221;. I just want to pick up on one of his points regarding Rev. Wright. What I found important was not so much the rantings and ravings that apparently filled his church. I find more significant that his church was actualy filled with enthusiastic listeners. When we listen to all those audio clips (my favorite is the one about the chickens coming home to roost), we are struck by the sounds of the congregation (presumably not including Mr. Obama) loudly assenting to the statements. <br>
It is not so much that we have a leadership in this country that is acting in a way inimical to the good of the nation; it is that there are so many blacks (and, sorry to say, whites) just cheering them on. </p>

		<p>The only reason for wanting a civilian army &#8220;as strong and as well-funded as the military&#8221; is so the military can be actively prevented from defending the US Constitution from its domestic enemies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve actually seen something exactly like this in the past.  A nation with a small army of only 100,000 men saw the growth of a parallel civilian paramilitary that eventually dwarfed the regular armed forces.  The country was Germany in the early 1930s, and the paramilitary that effectively prevented the army from overthrowing the Nazi government and returning Germany to some sense of normality while there was still time was the brown-shirted SA, or &#8220;Sturmabteilung&#8221;.  After the SA was eventually purged, the SS was expanded - from a force that had originally just provided bodyguards to Nazi politicians and officials - to a second army, intended once again to be a force strong enough to prevent the regular armed forces from overthrowing the government, no matter what barbarities that regieme perpetrated on Germany or the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>And yes, Ranger has hit the nail exactly on the head when he suggests that the New Black Panther party, Acorn, and similar left-wing radical hate groups will form the basis for this civilian force; the Justice Department&rsquo;s protection of voter intimidation as a &#8220;right&#8221; possessed by militant blacks proves this.  I&rsquo;ll bet anything you like that the oath they swear when they join will NOT be &#8220;I swear to defend the constitution of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Well done, Ranger.  I totally agree.  And to piggyback on JQ Buzzard&rsquo;s remark about Rev. Jeremiah Wrong, I always thought it odd that OPRAH WINFREY was smart enough to get out of that church LONG before dumdum Obama finally figured out that he&rsquo;d better split too.  Today nobody connects Oprah with that church, but you better believe she WAS there and she heard every word, and she only left when she saw people were going to get wise to her being there because of the publicity that Obama would generate.  It is no accident that Oprah is where she is today; she is one smart woman - and a lot smarter than Obama ever thought of being.  He only THINKS he&rsquo;s going to get a civilian army going - I tell you, if he tries that, it would be yet another testimonial to his ineptness and incompetence as a leader; the blood will flow in this land.  I hope it never comes to that, but Americans will NEVER put up with such a thing.  Pay attention, America!!! </p>
