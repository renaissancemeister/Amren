<h1>County Spent Millions on Welfare for Illegal Immigrants&rsquo; American Children</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Wall, The Sun (San Bernardino), January 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Illegal immigrants aren&rsquo;t entitled to welfare. But their citizen children are.</p>
<p>Nationwide, one in three immigrant-headed households uses at least one major welfare program, compared with 19 percent of citizen households, according to the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank that advocates immigration reduction.</p>
<p>In California, 192,660 citizen children are getting welfare checks passed through their illegal immigrant parents. That costs $546 million a year in state, federal and county funds, officials say.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers say it&rsquo;s an expense California can&rsquo;t afford as the state struggles to close a nearly $20 billion budget gap.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>County officials provided data from August 2009 to show the funding and number of American-born children of illegal immigrants receiving aid in the CalWORKs and food stamp programs.</p>
<p>Information for all of 2009 was not easily retrievable, officials said, but the August figures are an accurate reflection of a monthly total during the year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The maximum CalWORKs grant for a family of three in the county is $661 per month. The maximum amount of food stamp assistance that a family of three can get is $526 a month.</p>
<p>The American-born children of illegal immigrants made up 15.5 percent of the CalWORKs caseload and 6.5 percent of the food stamp caseload in the county last year.</p>
<p>About 15,000 citizen children of illegal immigrants in the county received either CalWORKs or food stamps in a typical month last year. More than 11,000 used both programs in an average month in 2009, according to county data.</p>
<p>In August, the county spent nearly $3.3 million for CalWORKs and about $2 million for food stamps for the American-born children of illegal immigrants. The two programs totaled nearly $64 million when multiplied over 12 months.</p>
<p>The county contributes roughly $1.7 million a year of its own funds to run the programs, officials say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The welfare expenses don&rsquo;t count pregnancy-related services that were provided last year to about 2,350 illegal immigrant women in the county through Medi-Cal, a health-care program for low-income California residents.</p>
<p>The welfare costs also don&rsquo;t include the roughly $11 billion the state spends annually for education, unreimbursed health care and incarceration of illegal immigrant criminals, said Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation of American Immigration Reform, a Washington D.C.-based group that favors strict immigration limits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There is a five-year time limit for adults receiving CalWORKs. But children are still entitled to their share of benefits after their parents are cut off.</p>
<p>There is no time limit for the food stamp program.</p>
<p>The county did not have data on the average length of time an illegal immigrant parent with an American-born child receives CalWORKs or food stamps.</p>
<p>Supporters of the CalWORKs program say the proposed cuts would have devastating consequences.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics of illegal immigration call the children &#8220;anchor babies&#8221; whose citizenship allows their illegal immigrant parents to gain a foothold in this country and receive welfare and other benefits for their kids.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Others have a different view.</p>
<p>California could reap an economic boon worth $16 billion by legalizing its 1.8 million Latino illegal immigrant adults, helping fix the state&rsquo;s financial problems, according to a report released last week by the USC Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration.</p>

		<p>This is old news in NJ.  Illegals receive Food Stamps, welfare, Medicaid, emaergency assistance, temporary rental assistance and so on for &#8220;the Children&#8221;.  It is a total scam that illegals contribute more than they take.</p>

		<p>That article about how wonderful legalizing the illegal aliens would be, and resulting supposedly in a $16 billion &#8220;economic boom&#8221;, was written by MANUEL Pastor, Justin Scoggins, Jennifer Tran, and Rhonda ORTIZ.  I haven&rsquo;t read the report, but I suspect that it is &#8220;junk science&#8221;.  These people have an EFFECT-CAUSE mentality, rather than cause and effect.  In this case they want illegal aliens to be granted amnesty, so they go out and find any old excuse to make it look like the best policy.  So what if they have to manipulate a few numbers!</p>
<p>What many of these Mexicans want is our land, and they will come up with any reason in the world to justify the taking over of it.  They say they are descendants of the American Indian that used to live in the American Southwest, when in reality their descendants probably lived in what is today the failed state of Mexico.</p>
<p>Yes, the white man did conquer North America.  However, that was the way things were done back in the 1500s, 1600s, 1700s, and 1800s.  Might won out in those days!  They took land, that the Indians had taken from a previous tribe, who took it from a previous tribe, who took it from a previous tribe, who took it from a previous tribe&hellip;..etc!  The white man&rsquo;s lands were also up for grabs in this period.  Wasn&rsquo;t it in the 1600s that Count Dracula and those other brave Austrians stopped the Moslems at Vienna?</p>
<p>Anyway, let&rsquo;s not let anyone talk us out of our lands.  We still control the American Southwest, but we are going to lose it unless we get serious about keeping it, and NOW!</p>

<p>How odd, shouldn&rsquo;t the state of California have a $20 billion budget surplus?</p>
<p>After all, doesn&rsquo;t diversity only &ldquo;enrich&rdquo; and never impoverishes, except in the paranoid delusions of &ldquo;racists?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What am I missing here?</p>

		<p>Hundreds of millions spent on anchor babies in California? You bet. But what is needed is some background information. The money spent on &#8220;anchor babies&#8221;, is taken from California seniors,(many on small fixed incomes),by increasing their already huge property taxes, small businesses already overburdened with taxes, and large businesses, many of which have simply split California. There is a guy who makes a very good living, simply arranging for businesses to transfer out of California to neighboring Nevada. Business taxes in Nevada are a fraction of California&rsquo;s. The invasion from Mexico is going to sink this nation, if it continues, just as it has sunk once powerful but now bankrupt California, that has a zero credit rating. One nation, even the U.S., cannot incorporate a huge part of another nation into it&rsquo;s borders, without serious ghastly consequences. Especially when it comes to Mexico being that nation.</p>

<p>Ask them this:  If these new citizens will make America stronger, then why can&rsquo;t they make Mexico stronger?  We shouldn&rsquo;t be racist, and keep all these economy-enhancing people to ourselves.  Be compassionate, and share them with their own countries.</p>

		<p>I suggest the numbers are much greater than admitted. I also see these programs as generational. As the parents of immigrants children become dependent upon state entitlements they become permanent dependents&hellip;  most specifically the mothers who have children to multiple partners.  The entire system is ripe with corruption, deception and a recipe for bankruptcy.  These people do not care about US laws do not respect US.  Their state sponsored children quickly become young parents and perpetuate the problem repeatedly over again.  This is now a social and generational problem that citizenship will not solve. No amount of money can solve the social deficit this brings to Amercia.<br>
The costs are both intangible and un-sustainable..<br>
Those who support this behavior are not stepping up to the plate to pay for it. Instead they insist upon legislation to legitimize expenses to taxpayers for foreign culture/behaviors.V</p>

		<p>I thought that at least ONE parent had to be a legal citizen of the United States for the child to be considered a citizen. <br>
Last night I as I dragged myself home from a second shift job, I saw a young mexican in the gas station with a late model, extra cab Ford pickup.  One guess how these people are able to afford these things.  The government taxes us to death and they get a free ride and their cash-money job buys all the goodies the rest of us can&rsquo;t afford.</p>

		<p>Well so much for the myth that illegals give more than they get back.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most infuriating part of this story? Is it the fact that we&rsquo;re actually providing an incentive for illegals to have children - as many children as possible - so that they can get into the welfare system?</p>
<p>Or is it the fact that they use American-born children of illegal immigrants as moral &#8220;cover&#8221; to justify feeding the poor and desperate Mexicans who shouldn&rsquo;t even be here in the first place? </p>
<p>Or is it the blatant transfer of wealth going on here from predominantly white middle class income taxpayers, property taxpayers and business owners? I hope the pro-illegal labor wing of the GOP takes notice that their profits aren&rsquo;t free and clear. </p>
