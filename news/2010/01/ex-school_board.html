<h1>Ex-School Board Presidents&rsquo; Spending Questionable: Probe</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fran Spielman and Rosalind Rossi, Chicago Sun-Times, January 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former Chicago School Board President Michael Scott and his predecessor, Rufus Williams, decorated their offices with expensive artwork and drank and dined at upscale restaurants  &mdash;  all on the taxpayers&rsquo; tab, sources say a new investigation into questionable spending has found.</p>
<p>The probe also uncovered evidence that Williams charged the board more than $1,000 for a private limousine that squired him around the heralded Harlem Children&rsquo;s Zone and New York City during a one-day visit there, the Sun-Times has learned.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shortly after his death, it was revealed Scott had charged some $3,000 in airfare, hotel and meal expenses to the Chicago Board of Education during his October trip to Copenhagen for the International Olympic Committee&rsquo;s final vote on the 2016 Summer Games. Scott, a member of Chicago&rsquo;s Olympic bid committee, had started paying that money back before he died, Chicago Public School officials have said.</p>
<p>A new report by Sullivan reveals that Scott and Williams each used a board credit card to purchase artwork, costing some $3,000 per piece at Chicago&rsquo;s Gallery Guichard for display in their board offices, one source said.  Many board offices and hallways are decorated with far less expensive student artwork or photographs of students.</p>
<p>Sullivan also uncovered evidence that Williams billed the board for an expensive piece of clothing purchased on Michigan Avenue and then repaid the board after investigators questioned him, one source said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Both presidents charged the board for meals and liquor at upscale restaurants, sources say the Sullivan investigation found. At the time, each already received a monthly stipend to cover such in-town expenses.</p>
<p>The report also targets credit card charges made by Steve Washington, William&rsquo;s former chief of staff, who resigned from the board earlier this month, sources said.</p>

		<p>Just Africans, behaving as they do, anywhere in the world. Show me where it&rsquo;s different.<br>
Africans are more given to what we call corruption. (Hey, I&rsquo;d never defend the honor of Ted Kennedy), but to Africans, our type of honor is a rare thing, and what we call corruption is their everyday norm, not even worth a comment.<br>
 They come from a cosmology that has little altruism, little civic pride or obligation, little shame, and BIG, fragile egos.</p>
<p>And they LOVE to show off. They are the most materialistic people on earth. So odd, that they can come up with such little material to show off, but when they do, look out. <br>
&#8220;MR.&#8221;T may have been light comedy, but he represented an ideal for africans.<br>
So weighed down with gold, he could barely turn his head. <br>
Then there&rsquo;s the gold teeth, the hubcaps, the pimp mobiles, the purple suits,ad nauseam. Man, I&rsquo;d hate to be a black guy keepin&rsquo; up with the Jonses. Such an expensive way to waste one&rsquo;s life&hellip;</p>

		<p>Uh-huh, it&rsquo;s the same old story - different faces, same story.  Any time blacks get into a position of power, COUNT ON IT - they are going to take advantage of it, and charge their expenses to anyone but themselves.  I think it&rsquo;s a racial, genetic flaw with them, that they instantly become corrupt even if they are awarded the position of head custodian at an institution.  Power corrupts - only these people don&rsquo;t need but a smidgen of power to go out and spend other people&rsquo;s money on themselves.  Why are we allowing this to go unchallenged?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that the latino politicians here in CA engage in exactly the same behavior. Exactly. They also develop the same arrogance as blacks in positions like this. </p>

<p>NO, Scott did just NOT die. Scott was found dead, a suicide. He shot himself. Under circumstances that raised some eyebrows in some quarters. But the cops investigated and it apparently IS a suicide.</p>

		<p>Sad to say this is hardly a Black thing. We had a college president who is now serving 10 years in prison for pocketing money from donors.</p>
<p>A friend of mine told me they had a similar situation at their university. </p>
