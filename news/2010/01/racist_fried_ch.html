			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andra Jackson and Peter Mitchell (Melbourne), The Age, January 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>KFC Australia&rsquo;s head office has apologised for any offence its controversial cricket ad has caused in America, saying it has been misinterpreted as racist.</p>
<p>The commercial, featuring a white Australian cricket fan offering fried chicken to West Indies supporters, was made for the Australian television market but was seen in America after it was posted on YouTube.</p>
<p>In the wake of the debate that raged in American media over whether it was racist, KFC&rsquo;s Australian head office yesterday said the advertisement has been pulled from the air in Australia.</p>
<p>KFC Australia said in a statement posted on its website that it apologised unreservedly for &#8220;any misinterpretation&#8221; caused by the cricket ad, saying it was not meant to offend anyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been made aware that a KFC commercial being shown on Australian television has apparently caused offence, particularly in the United States, after a copy of the commercial was reproduced online without KFC&rsquo;s permission,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we believe this light-hearted commercial has been well understood by Australian cricket fans, to avoid the possibility of any further offence being caused by the advertisement either here or online overseas, KFC will cease running the commercial immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;KFC Australia apologises unreservedly for any offence caused, which, of course, was wholly unintended.&#8221;</p>
<p>KFC Australia spokesman Zac Rich said last night the company had received only two complaints about the advertisement from people in Australia and they were &#8220;along the same lines as in America&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Australian TV commercial was picked up by US media, including the New York Daily News and Baltimore Sun, and drew debate, with Americans accusing Australians of being racist because it perpetuates a stereotype that African Americans eat a lot of fried chicken.</p>
<p>The New York Daily News staged a poll on its website asking if the ad was offensive.</p>
<p>The vote was almost split, with 51 per choosing &#8220;No, it&rsquo;s just lighthearted and fun&#8221; while 42 per cent selected &#8220;Yes, it plays on stereotypes&#8221;, and 6 per cent voted &#8220;I&rsquo;m not sure&#8221;.</p>
<p>Readers inundated the newspaper websites with emotional posts.</p>

		<p>Even when you show them in a positive light (which you must be obsessed with doing) you&rsquo;re still charged with racism/insensitivity. It just goes to show that the extreme &#8216;racists&rsquo; of yesteryear, they knew a thing or two? It&rsquo;s best if you just have nothing to do with them. </p>

<p>Having watched the commercial, I have to moderately agree with the 51% that found this only to be, &ldquo;just lighthearted and fun.&rdquo; Given that the blacks in the video are seemingly agitated and on the verge of a now expected &ldquo;spontaneous act of self-expression,&rdquo; or what normal people call a riot, it might be hitting home and a little &ldquo;too close&rdquo; for some as well. Please note, they are becalmed by the handout chicken bucket; much like a consumable form of on the spot affirmative action.</p>
<p>Perhaps, that is what the oppositional and offended 42% and confused 6% are really reacting to?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Suppose blacks like fried chicken. So what? I like friend chicken (I&rsquo;m white.) I even like (dare we say it?) watermelon! What&rsquo;s going on here is playing the victim, the idea that &#8220;Dear me, you have offended me so terribly, so you must do as I demand to make amends!&#8221;</p>

<p>And who are said Americans?  I can ill believe that the average person, or even the average black American, gets worked up over some guy in Melbourne thinking that black Americans (i.e. what they see of them on Oprah) like fried chicken.  I like fried chicken.</p>

		<p>As an Australian, I find this pretty amusing, so I&rsquo;ll give you the context that no one in the american media seems to be giving.</p>
<p>-KFC is the main sponsor of the australian national cricket team<br>
-This ad was shown during the match against the match against the West Indies<br>
-Australians like the West Indian cricket team and their fans<br>
-Someone correct me here if i&rsquo;m wrong, but i believe the national dish of Jamaica is Goat curry, not chicken.</p>
<p><br>
It seems to me this action was taken by a bunch of paranoid white americans who view everything through their own lens. How the hell are us Aussies supposed to know this stuff stirs up trouble, and why are they coming into our backyard to find it?</p>

		<p>can&rsquo;t we be honest and handle the fact that black people love fried chicken probably more than any other race or ethnic group. at least they have that reputation. it&rsquo;s legendary how much they&rsquo;re supposed to love watermelons. i just don&rsquo;t understand why it&rsquo;s such a negative to be fond of fried chicken or watermelon. <br>
if they hadn&rsquo;t made such a big deal out of it it probably would&rsquo;ve died as a stereotype years ago.</p>

		<p>This HAS to be the stupidest thing I&rsquo;ve heard in years - it&rsquo;s only racist if you&rsquo;re an overly-sensitive American-born black whose ancestors were slaves.  No people in any other country would have any problem with it.  The complaining makes America look like a nation of simpering, whimpering whiners.  And, well, come to think of it, that DOES describe the people who have a &#8220;victim&#8221; and &#8220;entitlement&#8221; mentality&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Saw the ad and beats me at all what the problem is..as a proud<br>
Aussie I can probably say over 99% of ordinary folk here would<br>
feel the same way<br>
Yet in  the States for some folk its a different story&hellip;<br>
Indeed once our own fast growing ethnic minorities gain some more influence here the Aussie sense of humor is in for some troubled very political correct times <br>
Actually we had a similar issue here several months ago<br>
with a blackface skit here on a TV show which was loudly panned by Harry ConnicK Junior from the US of A<br>
Funny how some of these show biz liberal types thunder and scream racism at any any hint of of the slightest  inane humor<br>
with even the smallest racial connotations&hellip;heck we used<br>
to watch Benny Hill sending up Asians,blacks,other whites,blondes etc<br>
for a great fun and laugh&hellip;seems he has also  been relegated to the political incorrect dustbin of history &hellip;as often quoted by another writer here&hellip;`God help us all!    <br>

		<p>Any black, bleeding-heart white, or media person who makes such complaints is just trying to get attention.  How could anyone seriously believe it&rsquo;s demeaning to like chicken, a meat that is widely eaten by various groups?!  Blacks constantly make jokes themselves about blacks and chicken.  It&rsquo;s just one more incident that proves many people think there&rsquo;s something wrong with being black, since anything that somehow points out the fact is deemed racially hateful.  Thus, many non-black folks agree with #1: have nothing to do with blacks.<br>
There&rsquo;s a commercial on TV that will probably draw criticism, although a similar one was done with a white man playing the boss.  It&rsquo;s either by FedEx or UPS, featuring a boss walking through his vast office space, congratulating workers and promising bonuses, etc.  He doesn&rsquo;t realize that some of the people there are FedEx, UPS, or whatever.  The black-character version could easily be seen as one lampooning an unknowledgeable, blowhard black man.</p>

		<p>I agree with John PM.  There&rsquo;s more to this than just the &#8220;offense&#8221; taken at the stereotype of Blacks liking fried chicken.  I&rsquo;m Southern and White, and I like fried chicken too.  If I were from New York (God forbid!), I&rsquo;d still like fried chicken. Although I&rsquo;ve never found any Italian roots in my genealogy, I love chicken marsal as well. At least I&rsquo;m versatile when it comes to cuisine. Most of us race realists are familiar enough with the &#8220;spontaneous acts of self-expression&#8221; that Blacks stage.  The truth really does hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they shall beat their ploughshares into swords and their pruning hooks into spears.&#8221;</p>
