			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Goldstein and Peter Whoriskey, Washington Post, January 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The tension between U.S. policy and the desperation to leave [Haiti] is spawning a debate in Washington over whether the government should let more Haitians in. Immigration advocates and several members of Congress have begun pressing the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department to ease the rules. So far, the focus is on two groups: Haitians with relatives legally in the United States and a few hundred injured children who, in the judgment of doctors doing relief work in Haiti, could die without sophisticated medical care.</p>
<p>In the first days after the Jan. 12 quake, Napolitano announced that the government would admit Haitian children already on the cusp of adoption and that it would allow Haitians who were in the United States illegally to stay for 18 months. The administration has not eased restrictions for children newly orphaned or injured by the disaster, Haitians who had already been seeking U.S. visas, or any other earthquake victims who want to come.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While Nelson [Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.)] wants to admit only critically injured children for treatment, a groundswell is building in favor of letting certain Haitians emigrate. Advocates&rsquo; immediate focus is Haitians who, before the disaster, had applied  &mdash;  and in some cases been approved  &mdash;  for a kind of visa available to foreign relatives of U.S. citizens or permanent legal residents.</p>
<p>About 19,000 Haitians have pending applications for such visas, according to DHS. Nearly 55,000 Haitians have been approved for family visas but are on waiting lists to enter because Congress has set limits on how many may come each year, the State Department says. Given the quotas, &#8220;it can take years and years for families to be reunited,&#8221; said Cheryl Little, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Homeland Security&rsquo;s Citizenship and Immigration Services said the agency would &#8220;put at the head of the line&#8221; applicants for relative visas from Haiti. But he and a State Department spokeswoman acknowledged that quicker visa approvals would not mean those Haitians could enter the United States more quickly unless Congress alters the quotas  &mdash;  something lawmakers are not discussing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors tighter controls on immigration, countered that &#8220;poverty and underdevelopment can&rsquo;t be criteria we use to pick immigrants. There are too many of them.&#8221; And he said that Haitian earthquake victims could consume U.S. social services and displace American workers  &mdash;  without generating enough income to send back to Haiti &#8220;to make a difference&#8221; there.</p>
<p>Still, Elliott Abrams, a deputy national security adviser under President George W. Bush who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that if the United States doubled for the next five years the 25,000 Haitians who have been coming to the United States annually, it would substantially increase the remittances sent back, providing critical help as the nation tries to rebuild. Such help streaming home to families is more reliable and more likely to be spent efficiently than the ebb and flow of foreign aid, he said. Abrams suggested that to satisfy critics of increased immigration, the United States could offset the influx of Haitians by temporarily slowing immigration from elsewhere.</p>

Watching the evening news, you see white people scrambling to get their very own trophy Haitian earthquake children.</p>
<p>The only hope to temper this is that blacks will see this as attempt by whites to steal their children and destroy their culture. I know this issue does rile some blacks and it came up last week on a local black radio talk show.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors tighter controls on immigration, countered that &lsquo;poverty and underdevelopment can&rsquo;t be criteria we use to pick immigrants. There are too many of them.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>
<p>This is a profoundly wise and unquestionably sane approach to the issue of altruistic &ldquo;immigration&rdquo; policy Mr. Krikorian; thus, you get a sincere bravo from me!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that won&rsquo;t buy you a grain of sand in most places, let alone some pancakes with syrup and the choice of bacon or sausage on the side. Sadly, reason on this issue is denounced as &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; in this age of  sentimental idiocy. You, like me, are considered a &ldquo;monster,&rdquo; for not wanting to turn your country into a giant Haiti, where natural disasters are not overcome with preplanned tenacity, but simply overwhelm and destroy through incompetent hysteria.</p>
<p>The Haitians made their deathbeds a long time ago, through their ancestors&rsquo; barbaric butchering of the French minority of managers and planners they once were gifted with. They, made a decision to overthrow their racial &ldquo;oppressors,&rdquo; and have suffered horrors of their and nature&rsquo;s design ever since. The same is true of much of the &ldquo;underdeveloped&rdquo; world (more aptly described as the perpetually primitive decolonized &ldquo;paradises&rdquo; that make up about 2/3rds of the earth&rsquo;s &ldquo;liberated&rdquo; peoples of color,) which have gone from the last half of the 20th Century, straight into the first two decades of the 21st with their: hands out, eyes closed, and mouths open endlessly. </p>
<p>Hey, can&rsquo;t save them all from their decisions and folly, via &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; invasions into the West. It has to stop somewhere and I say that somewhere is here and now.</p>
<p>Thus far, no farther; if not, God help us all!</p>

		<p>It would seem to me that leaving the Haitians in Haiti might be the best course of action.  The able bodied men should be employed in clean-up operations.  The US (and other nations) could provide the leadership and the equipment, the Haitian men the muscle.  In fact this could be an opportunity for Haitian men to learn valuable construction skills.  After the proper disposal of debris the rebuilding can begin, using Haitian labor.  Able bodied men would have to work for their food and water.  Not only would this clean up Haiti it would keep the men busy and out of mischief.</p>
<p>And Haitian woman?  Well, they can be employed in the care of the elderly, orphans and the sick.  Rescue workers could teach Haitian woman basic practical nursing skills.  The women could also be employed in the distribution of food, water and sanitary supplies.  And they can cook for and feed the laborers.</p>
<p>The Army is great at setting up mobile and temporary housing.  MASH units for the sick.  Tents to house and feed people.  With guidance from rescue workers all this can be accomplished with Haitian labor.</p>
<p>Helping the Haitians help themselves is far more prudent than bringing them here and putting them on welfare.  By actually teaching the Haitians how to recover from this disaster and then having them actually do it themselves might cause a few of them come to the realization that they can build a nation and perhaps inspire futures leaders with a can-do spirit.  If it doesn&rsquo;t teach them anything, well, they will still be better off and so will we.<br>

		<p>Haitians are, and will always be, a drain on any White society.  They cannot build a civilization themselves, nor maintain a civilization that is given to them.  The plain fact is, Western aid has allowed Blacks, in Africa, America, and anywhere else they&rsquo;re found, to increase their numbers beyond their ability to sustain themselves.  They must either feed off of more capable peoples, or starve.  The only humane course is to make aid contingent on sterilization.  The alternatives are to let them consume our resources until the Earth is barren, or to step back and watch them die.  </p>

		<p>The USA can no longer be the dumping ground for all the world&rsquo;s failed people.  We simply don&rsquo;t have the money!  Already, our economy and society cannot accomodate the 40 Million+ recent immigrants and their children.  Examples include the economic destruction of California, once the greatest state in the USA.  Another example is the actual increased failure of &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; (i.e., Meso-American Indians) immigrants into the 2nd, &amp; 3rd generations in the USA (failue to graduate, low test scores, low employment, high crime, drug, teenage births, and illegetimate children).  As millions more (forever) impoverished &amp; failed people pour into our country, the costs to support them and their evergrowing families will bring economic ruin and ethnic balkinization to our nation.  </p>

		<p>Remember the vast thousands of white people from the Bosnian region who were made refugees by the criminal bombing of that area by the war criminals Wesley Clark and Bill Clinton?</p>
<p>Well, very reluctantly it was agreed the US would take some if the other European countries would do the same, under the stipulation that all would be returned home the first opportunity after hostilities subside.  (Which would be AFTER Clinton ceased his bombing attacks at a cowardly 15,000 feet.)</p>
<p>As I recall, no refugees were brought here, but contrast that situation with the blacks in Haiti who have to be cared for and would weigh down this system economically even more than it is now. These corrupt politicians are stumbling over themselves gushing about helping the Haitians.  (And, they think, increasing their chances for re-election.)  </p>
<p>I mean, the Europeans would contribute much profitable manpower to this society, and as we know from years of experience and looking at Africa, blacks bring nothing but crime, poverty, and an inability to care for themselves.  </p>
<p>These power and greedy demagogues are still looking to advance themselves as politically correct even in the face of economic disaster to this country.  As is always the case, their criminal conduct only adds to this nation&rsquo;s financial woes.</p>
<p>I fully expect to see MANY blacks relocated here.  And I fully expect this country to eventually look every bit as bad as the typical Haiti scene before the earthquake, which was mass poverty and crime on a daily basis.</p>

<p>If an idiot like this was Bush&rsquo;s deputy national security adviser, Bush is an even more abjectly miserable oaf than I thought he was. The welfare these Haitians would consume would far outstrip the amount of aid that they could ever possibly send back.</p>
<p>I wonder if this controversy could result in another black eye for Obama? He already lost a lot of white support, we are told, thanks to the &#8220;Henry Gates incident.&#8221; Surely a &#8220;Haiti-gate,&#8221; which is a far more serious issue, could result in a big drop in support for this so-called &#8220;post-racial president&#8221; as well? </p>

		<p>Two million Haitians have come to the US over the years, according to what I have read.That is what their total population was just 50 years ago.If they could, the majority of them would come here because living in a trash dumpster in the US is more desirable than the average lifestyle is in Haiti.</p>

		<p>Like many race realist whites, I&rsquo;ve been wondering if the Haitian earthquake will provoke a mass migration of these congenitally hapless people into the USA. Watching and reading the news about what is happening there, it becomes apparent that the Haitians themselves are so disorganized and helpless - not simply by the earthquake, but all the time, as their history makes clear - that they could never manage a large-scale boatlift on their own.  The so-called Haitian boatlift in the &#8216;90&rsquo;s was never large in numbers   &mdash;   it was miniscule compared to the Cuban Mariel boatlift, but attracted attention largely because of its spectacular ineptitude (TV scenes of overloaded boats capsizing with hundreds of blackskinned ants tumbling into the sea) and because of the growing multicultural sentiment in the mainstream media that America somehow owed these people something, simply because they were black and most Americans were white (and therefore guilty of crimes against all non-whites for which they must atone).  Despite this, there was, even during the Clinton administration, enough residual sanity left in the minds of white government officials and newspaper columnists that made them realize a mass Haitian migration into this country was something to be avoided.  So the pundits didn&rsquo;t propose it and the government actually defended our coast against the feeble attempts Haitians made to land here.</p>
<p>Now, 20 years and one earthquake later, we have a situation in which several columnists (i/c Elliot Cohen and Michael Clemons) are proposing large scale Haitian immigration, and at least one Republican candidate for Congress is spearheading efforts to suspend the rules and bring Haitian orphans into the US immediately. However, except for granting TPS to Haitian illegals already here and expediting the immigration of orphans and critically injured children, the Obama administration has so far sounded almost conservative in discouraging any notions of a mass migration of Haitian refugees.  No doubt they are fearful of public backlash against such an event.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether some kind of public groundswell develops in favor of what Abrams and Clemons propose, but I&rsquo;m skeptical it will.  Most people - even those who govern us - aren&rsquo;t willing to say it out loud but know perfectly well that Haiti&rsquo;s main problem is Haitians.  Even Janet Napolitano seems to understand this.  So, aside from a few thousand, or tens of thousands at the most, I doubt we&rsquo;ll see any great exodus of Haitians to America.          </p>

		<p>I would suggest that if there Americans who wish to increase aid to Haiti, everybody&rsquo;s interests would be best served through the IRS, whereby with every tax return there would be an opportunity to contribute an amount consistent with every US citizen&rsquo;s view of what he should send to Haiti.</p>
<p>Of course, I and my family have our own personal obligations and requirements and thus would contribute nothing. But for those who wish to contribute to people whom they don&rsquo;t know and who show a discouraging propensity to fail socially, economically, and culturally, by all means, contribute to your heart&rsquo;s content.</p>

		<p>Anybody that shows any weakness on the Haitian invasion issues has to be put on notice that they will suffer terrible punishments for their treason, idiot acts.</p>
<p>I let a really nice White Latter Day Saint with a large White family, generally very good politics in California, but for some reason allowed one of his sons to go on a &#8220;mission&#8221; to Haiti and the son is going back to help out now - I let him know in no certain terms that they must not assist in bringing violent, hostile Haitians to the United States.</p>
<p>I told this LDS family that the 9 million Black Haitians were far more violent and destructive than the Lamenites in the Book of Mormon and they must not fall down and act like weak idiots in this situation.</p>
<p>I encourage all Amren readers to do the same with anyone they know who is considering doing doing stupid things during this Haitian mess, stupid stuff like adopting little cute Haitian monster orphans.</p>

		<p>Why is it that White people must always intervene, organize relief and rescue efforts, and save the day? Why can&rsquo;t Blacks take a leading role in the process?   &mdash;   and that does not mean having a rap concert to promote an upcoming gangster rap CD!</p>
<p>Blacks the world over seem to be in the perpetual custodial care of Whites. Of course, the White power elite wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way! Here&rsquo;s how it works&hellip;</p>
<p>Step 1: A natural disaster strikes! Naturally, Blacks are the &#8220;hardest hit&#8221;! Why does that sound so familiar?</p>
<p>Step 2: White politicians and wealthy corporate figureheads delegate others to organize and dispatch massive quantities of relief and rescue aid. The funds come almost exclusively from White taxpayers!</p>
<p>Step 3: The aid flows directly from the White tax payers, quickly through the hands of the Black victims, and quickly back into the hands of the organizers, via the returning revenue stream. How convenient! They gov-corp distributes the money for the victims to purchase relief supplies *and* they also happen to have the materials ready to sell to the victims! Talk about luck for the victims!</p>
<p>Step 4: The White politicians and corporate bigs take dozens of glorious photo ops! They pat each other on their backs, shake hands with local &#8220;officials&#8221;, and congratulate themselves on a job well done!</p>
<p>Step 5: The gov-corp dignitaries fly back home to bask in the new windfalls they suddenly raked in! The local victims are quickly discarded and forgotten! Quick! Call Jesse Jackson! Oh wait! He&rsquo;s off somewhere enjoying his own civil rights payoff from the disaster! </p>
<p>Step 6: Get to work, White taxpayers! You have billions and billions in disaster relief bills to pay and tens of thousands of new Haitian refugees to support! Chop chop!</p>
<p>So sad&hellip; but so true!</p>

		<p>You know what they&rsquo;re going to do, don&rsquo;t you?  Obama and company are going to use this as an excuse to get Haitians to come here en masse.  As if there weren&rsquo;t enough here already.  More money will go to the poor Haitians and even less to us.  This will assist in bringing us closer to a full-scale depression.  When we finally hit rock bottom it&rsquo;s going to be those same Haitians - along with the good ole American Blacks and Hispanics who do da lootin&rsquo; and shootin, you know, breakin&rsquo; into stores for food and clothing, that sort a thing.  </p>

		<p>I really do not understand why exporting some of the population would help any nation to recover from any disaster unless it is a very small island completely devastated by, say, a massive volcanic eruption which covers the entire land with lava flows,  sterile ash and dust. Nor do I understand why an obviously well fed, well clothed african Haitian preacher would appear on international news screaming to his packed congregation that White people could not help Haiti but only God would. Call me ignorant but when a team of visiting non-african rescuers are called back from the airport at the moment of departure because a Haitian man had just discovered his brother buried alive and the entire Haitian population was incapable of digging him out, then I must me missing something pretty basic. Who on earth would want such unreliable and incapable people to arrive in their home town to live as their neighbours knowing full well that the newcomers would contribute nothing but trouble whilst demanding everything to be handed to them on a plate and insisting that they should continue their Haitian voodoo lifestyle. <br>

		<p>It is worth mentioning that 30,000 Haitians have already been ordered to be deported from the USA. Given that the Federal idiots have slowed deportation to only those violent criminal illegal aliens, Mr. Obama now wants to keep 30,000 violent criminals (from Haiti) in the USA for another 18 months. How many Americans will suffer or be killed by his obstruction of court-ordered deportation?</p>
<p>For those of the 30,000 Haitians facing deportation, have you any idea how many of them are already in local, state and Federal prisons and other institutions? Will the Federal government reimburse the jailers for the costs of keeping the criminals locked up for another year and a half?</p>
<p>This country is simply insane.<br>

		<p>Haiti was and is the classic text-book example to illustrate the truth of the theory of the 18th century pioneering economist Thomas Malthus.<br>
Basically Haiti is just an unrestrained breeding colony where the carrying capacity of the land was outstripped decades ago, yet breeding goes on unabated.Mass starvation is only avoided by massive foreign subsidies and massive emigration.</p>

		<p>This Haiti business perfectly encapsulates how ideologically prostrate neo-cons are in the face of Black people.  Arabs and Chinese are easy to confront or demonize as they are either Caucasoids, technologically proficient, nationalistic, or in the case of Russia, all of the above.  Neo-cons/neo-liberals are only concerned with attacking entities that are competitive and capable of interfering with their regime of humane imperialism (i.e. world government, New World Order, etc.) and Blacks, being as dependent as they are on the regime, will prove a more insidious and enduring threat.</p>

		<p>Whether white racial consciousnes and its collective preservation is just in the brightest light of reason, or it falls short of true justice is the central dynamic we discuss here. Amrenner&rsquo;s are advocates of white collective preservation. These statements are obvious.. just as obvious to me is that if the white phenotype is not consciously preserved Now.. it will soon be destroyed by continuing to pay for other races failures and subsidizing their propogation, symultaneously failing to reproduce their its own kind. We are truly worshiping a false idol, sacrificing our genotype/fate to less evolved racial types that will consume us..we are feeding a mob that will in the end ..devour us*.</p>

<p>What a bizarre comment.  There are plenty of Haitian immigrants in France and many blacks in England and Italy. I can only assume John is consumed by some kind of Fox News/neocon inspired hatred of Europe, which is certainly a strange position for a someone who is supposedly pro-white to have.  </p>

<p>Watching the evening news, you see white people scrambling to get their very own trophy Haitian earthquake children.</p>
<p>The only hope to temper this is that blacks will see this as attempt by whites to steal their children and destroy their culture. I know this issue does rile some blacks and it came up last week on a local black radio talk show.</p>
<p><br>
This is not good either way.  American blacks will attack us for doing this and the Haitian blacks will be more blacks that will rape, rob, steal, leech off our taxes, and add more to the ghetto population.  I think a bloody, violent race war is the only thing going to wake up whites.  I hate violence, I don&rsquo;t want it to come to that, but it looks as if it will.  </p>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it a Haitian that sold that island country to the devil for 100 years to gain independence from the French, that period only ending around 2004?  If that memory serves me correctly, they deserve all they got and are getting from that litteral &#8220;deal with the devil&#8221;.</p>
<p>As for me, I&rsquo;m in agreement with everyone else who doesn&rsquo;t want a single extra &#8220;refugee&#8221; from Haiti here.  Like Mexicans bringing Mexico along when they come here, where there are Haitians, there is Haiti.  And I don&rsquo;t want to live in Haiti, or inflict it on anyone else.</p>
