<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8463921.stm">Senegal Offers Land to Haitians</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, January 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Senegal&rsquo;s president says he will offer free land and &#8220;repatriation&#8221; to people affected by the earthquake in Haiti.</p>
<p>President Abdoulaye Wade said Haitians were sons and daughters of Africa since Haiti was founded by slaves, including some thought to be from Senegal.</p>
<p>&#8220;The president is offering voluntary repatriation to any Haitian that wants to return to their origin,&#8221; said Mr Wade&rsquo;s spokesman, Mamadou Bemba Ndiaye.</p>
<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s earthquake killed tens of thousands and left many more homeless.</p>
<p>Buildings have been reduced to rubble, the distribution of aid is slow, and people have been flooding out of the devastated capital, Port-au-Prince.</p>
<p>&#8220;Senegal is ready to offer them parcels of land  &mdash;  even an entire region. It all depends on how many Haitians come,&#8221; Mr Bemba Ndiaye said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&rsquo;s just a few individuals, then we will likely offer them housing or small pieces of land. If they come en masse we are ready to give them a region.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spokesman emphasised that if a region was given, it would be in a fertile part of the country rather than in its parched deserts, the Associated Press news agency reported.<br>

		<p>This has got to be the greatest, most logical, most powerful idea, to ever come out of the mind of any African mind. Hopefully this is the beginning of African repatriation back to the motherland, and the separation of the races.</p>

		<p>The US should rent every cruise ship available, give each Haitian some &#8220;start up money&#8221; and help them go to Senegal!  Get them out of the western hemisphere and back home.  The US should then claim Haiti as a US territory and let whites colonize it and bring it back to a paradise like island.<br>

		<p>Has Obama read of this wonderful idea? I&rsquo;ll volunteer to send the 2,000,000 (plus?) Haitians presently in the U.S. and will even contribute a couple of bucks toward their air fares. There&rsquo;s really no need for us to quarrel with Senegal over who gets this wonderful injection of diversity. Spread the wealth around, I say!</p>

		<p>President Wade&rsquo;s offer of land was very generous for the native Haitians  that lost everything in the earthquake.  I would be very happy to see the impoverished victims go  to Senegal instesd of coming to the USA and bleeding us of our resources.</p>

		<p>Since the offer includes working to set up a home and attendant necessities, don&rsquo;t look for many blacks to take up this generous offer.</p>
<p>They would much rather go to the US, live in a delapidate hut that is no better than a rat hole, and collect freebies.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;It all depends on how many Haitians come,&rdquo; Mr Bemba Ndiaye said.</i></p>
<p>I can make a prediction that it will be a very small number   &mdash;   if any.  In the last three hundred years, the number of Western Hemisphere blacks to return to the mother continent has been basically inconsequential.  Even the creation of Liberia only succeeded in luring back a few thousand.  Probably far more have gone to Europe in that time.  Ultimately, despite all the &#8220;black is beautiful&#8221; and &#8220;African diaspora&#8221; rhetoric, they know what&rsquo;s best for themselves.</p>

		<p>Does anyone really think that they&rsquo;re going to go for that deal? Talk about jumping out of the pan into the fire. No they&rsquo;re holding out to come here. Everyone knows that the US will allow them to come here &#8220;temporarly&#8221;. It&rsquo;s just a matter of time, and they know it. Then,once here, they can send for their &#8220;extended families&#8221; which will add another million or so coming here. And I&rsquo;m sure they will be settled into areas deemed in need of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.<br>
The choice is a no brainer though - Senegal is just as [ if not more ] backwards as Haiti, and they couldn&rsquo;t play the race card or go on welfare, they&rsquo;d have to work. Coming here they&rsquo;d be able to lay around and have their every need taken care of by Whitey [ Whitey is aready fighting each other over who will have the honor of helping these noble Hatians ]. This, in turn, will allow them plenty of free time to rape, rob, assault and murder those &#8220;racisss&#8221; White folks.   </p>

		<p>This proposal is certainly interesting, but here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to see. There are currently five million whites remaining in South Africa and around eight million blacks in Haiti. Let&rsquo;s offer them all the option of trading countries. Give the new inhabitants of Haiti,namely the whites, what Haiti would receive in foreign aid from all sources for the next 15 years and let&rsquo;s step back and see what it looks like.</p>

		<p>As good as this offer seems to be, there will be few Haitians interested in returning to Africa. There they would continue to be poor and even worse, they would be expected to work for a living. No, the Haitians dream of making it north to the United States where the welfare dollars flow freely.<br>

		<p>Finally, a black nation willing to do something for the Hatians. I doubt any will go there, the welfare and freebies is what the Haitians want and the Senegal government may not have all the super good freebies the Haitians KNOW they can get here or in Canada.</p>

		<p>Now that&rsquo;s the best idea I&rsquo;ve heard in this entire situation!!  I think it&rsquo;s wonderful that the Senegalese are so willing to accept their brethren Haitians.  And if I were a poverty stricken Haitian (is there any other kind?), I b&rsquo;lieve I&rsquo;d go.  A house and a plot of land sounds a whole lot better than anything people have ever had in Haiti.

If there are any other African heads of state that would like to offer free land and repatriation to residents of Detroit, Gary, Camden, St. Louis, New Orleans and Philly, I am sure that we could muster enough $$$ to provide transportation to make this dream a reality.

		<p>This is not such a bad idea. Haiti was such a mess already and now even MUCH worse. Those folks have no place left to live, their homes as they had being destroyed and almost anywhere is better than it is now.</p>
<p>All that is being done by offering aid as it is to the survivors is to perpetuate misery on a gigantic scale.</p>

		<p>This actually is a fantastic idea! I would suggest that the 100+ million dollars in aid Obama has promised would be better spent shipping Haitians to Senegal, including the ones living in America. Maybe South Africa would be so kind as to offer free land to our African-American friends. Though I doubt many would want to get off the gravy train they&rsquo;re riding here.</p>

		<p>Haitians would be crazy not to take the deal. Billions in aid to the island will be nothing but a Bandage on a festering wound. Things will be back to square one within a few months.<br>
The question is that if they go to Senegal, will they earn the gift that was given to them or will they become a source of trouble to the Senegalese.  After years of expecting handouts, will they be able to work hard and acheive something. I&rsquo;m rooting for them to be successful because it will prevent thousands more coming to the US and bringing their pathologies with them.</p>

Has anyone seen the play &#8220;No Exit&#8221;?</p>
<p>In it, three people are locked in a room. They each hate each other or have a strong dislike for each other. They argue endlessly about their feelings for each other. The room of course represent purgatory or hell. When the pressure gets to be too much, the door opens and anyone is free to leave. They close the door and stay in their private hell.</p>
<p>The play could have been written to highlight the nature of blacks to complain about their condition with whites and yet cling to them when given the chance to leave.</p>
<p>Whites leave all the time but blacks follow them and complain how evil whites are.</p>
<p>Blacks create their own hell and are happy to stay.<br>
