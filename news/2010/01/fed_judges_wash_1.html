			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rachel La Corte, Breitbart, January 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Incarcerated felons should be allowed to vote in Washington to ensure that racial minorities are protected under the Voting Rights Act, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 2-1 ruling by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the 2000 ruling of a district judge in Spokane. That judge had ruled that state law did not violate the act, and dismissed a lawsuit filed by a former prison inmate from Bellevue.</p>
<p>The two appellate judges ruled that disparities in the state&rsquo;s justice system &#8220;cannot be explained in race-neutral ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>The issues the ruling raises about racial bias in the justice system are not unique to Washington state, said Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, a Washington, D.C., group promoting sentencing reform.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed by Muhammad Shabazz Farrakhan of Bellevue. He was serving a three-year sentence at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla for a series of felony-theft convictions when he sued the state in 1996.</p>
<p>Ultimately, five other inmates, all members of racial minority groups, joined as plaintiffs.</p>
<p>The lawsuit contended that because nonwhites make up a large percentage of the prison population, a state law prohibiting inmates and parolees from voting is illegal because it dilutes the electoral clout of minorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year, lawmakers passed a law that allows convicted felons to reregister to vote once they&rsquo;re no longer on parole or probation. Previously, felons who were no longer in Washington state custody but owed court-ordered fines and restitution were not allowed to vote.</p>
<p>Washington&rsquo;s neighbor, Oregon, automatically restores voting rights to felons once they&rsquo;re released from prison. Nearly 40 other states and the District of Columbia also have less onerous restrictions on restoring voting rights to felons.</p>
<p>Maine and Vermont are the only states that allow those behind bars to cast ballots.<br>

		<p>Maine and Vermont allow incarcerated criminals to vote, eh?<br>
I&rsquo;m not surprised that these two bastians of idiotic political correctness would pass suc h a law.</p>
<p>I wonder how Maine likes their Somalis by now after surrfering gang crimes and warfare in a state that had very low crime and no gangs at all.</p>
<p>Both states deserve what they&rsquo;re going to get as the situation deteriorates even further.</p>

		<p>I tell you what  &mdash;  If it weren&rsquo;t for that nutty 9th appellate circuit, there wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a need for the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>WA&rsquo;s law is like MO&rsquo;s  &mdash;  convicted felons can vote as long as they&rsquo;re both out of prison and off probation.  WA recently made it easier for felons to vote  &mdash;  Before, felons could vote only if they were both out of the joint and off probation, and weren&rsquo;t in arrears on fines or restitution.  (There&rsquo;s the problem with so many black ex-cons  &mdash;  They can&rsquo;t stay out of trouble long enough to get off probation, at least until they&rsquo;re old men.)  Yet, that wasn&rsquo;t enough for six black prison inmates, and a three-judge panel of the 9th Circus.  Previously, the Federal district judge in Spokane ruled for the state.</p>
<p>The attorneys for the felons contend that any prohibition against felons voting has the disparate impact of weakening black political clout, b/c the justice system is biased against minorities.  What they mean is that blacks misbehave more often.  The truth of the matter is that the justice system is biased toward minorities, b/c a combination of Federal and state civil rights laws, precedence and black jury nullification works in the favor of black defendants at every stage of criminal charge disposition proceedings.  Even before the formal trial process, blacks tend to live in either heavily black or white liberal political jurisdictions, where a lot of black crime is ignored or unsolvable, and there are a lot of black cops who sympathize with black crime, or handcuffed white cops who live in fear of civil rights prosecution.  If the CJ system were genuinely fair, then many more blacks would be in prison, and be ineligible to vote.  That it is biased in favor of them actually helps to enhance their political clout.</p>
<p>If the ruling survives SCOTUS, I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;ll mean that a lot of imprisoned felons will vote.  I do think that it&rsquo;ll make it easier to commit voter fraud, because names on the rolls, even if the corporeal humans behind those names don&rsquo;t vote, allow corrupt poll workers to stuff boxes with fake votes after hours, and to check off that a registered person &ldquo;voted,&rdquo; without raising suspicion.  A couple of Democrat Senators want &#8220;universal voter registration,&#8221; i.e. they want state canvassing boards to automatically register people on welfare rolls and drivers license rolls even if they don&rsquo;t want to be registered.  It&rsquo;ll only make voter fraud easier.</p>
<p>However, it wouldn&rsquo;t much affect the American body politic at the outset.  Washington State is as blue as can be in terms of Presidential politics, and I would imagine that most of WA&rsquo;s prison inmates come from solidly blue Congressional districts.  What I mean by that is that even though the prisons are in the middle of nowhere, the inmate lived in the ghetto section of Seattle at the time he was shipped off to prison, so that will be his &ldquo;official residence&rdquo; for voting.  (Thinking out loud here about a dilemma, hypothetical to MO.  What if a young man who lives on the North Side of St. Louis gets sent off to Jefferson City for a life term for murder, and gets to vote thanks to the Federal Judiciary.  And the people, presumably his mother and siblings, occupying his last residence pre-prison move to South St. Louis City.  Does this mean that his &ldquo;residence&rdquo; will change to a part of the city he&rsquo;ll never see or live in, and vote there in the 3rd Congressional District, i.e. Russ Carnahan, compared to his previous 1st, i.e. Lazy Clay?  Or will he &ldquo;reside&rdquo; in Jefferson City and vote in what is now Ike Skelton&rsquo;s district?)  Though WA does have a Republican AG, and he&rsquo;s defending the state in these proceedings.  (A Republican statewide office holder in WA State?  I know, stranger things have happened.)  But it might swing the outcome of an election like WA had in 2004 for Governor, where Christine Gregoire needed every vote she got (and every vote she didn&rsquo;t get, IMHO) to win.</p>

		<p>Why is it that a successful, law-abiding person such as myself has no more political power &mdash; in terms of voting &mdash; than a crack dealer, violent criminal and thief?</p>
<p>Felons should not be able to vote, because it&rsquo;s unfair to people who abide by the law. Furthermore, voting rights should not be extended to people on welfare. I also believe that IQ tests should be implemented to determine eligible voters: a minimum score of 100 should be necessary to be able to vote.</p>

<p>The fact that so many minorities choose to commit criminal acts thatlands them in prison and thusly forfeits their voting rights, dilutes the electoral clout of minorities.</p>

		<p>The only thing that &#8220;dilutes the electoral clout of minorities&#8221; is the criminal conduct that they engage in of their own free will. This is just one more example of the lowering of our standards to the lowest common denominator as a way to force racial equality, equality that will never exist with a racially blind level playing field.</p>

		<p>Citizenship is not to be taken lightly. Either one is a first class citizen, with the awesome power of the vote, or one is not. A true citizen has certain rights and obligations as a citizen: to vote, to sit on juries judging fellow citizens, and to keep and bear firearms. By allowing felons to vote, a mockery is made of the seriousness of the franchise. The power to vote is, in effect, the power to rule the people. Do we want to be ruled by felons? Felons who are (rightly) not allowed to bear arms, and who would be, in effect, second class citizens!</p>

		<p> The &#8220;racial disparity&#8221; the loony-left 9th is agonizing about is actually the fact that non-Whites   &mdash;   specifically, blacks and Hispanics   &mdash;   commit a grossly disproportionate percentage of the violent crime in this country. I hear that the state is going to appeal this to the U.S. Supreme Court. Hopefully it will have a better grip on sanity than does the 9th.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s remarkable that the observation that those incarcerated are mainly black and Hispanic should form the basis for the argument that the vote should be extended to those serving sentences.  In other words, those who represent the worst elements of society should be free to vote for those most sympathetic to the criminals.</p>

		<p>Universal suffrage is a BIG mistake.  Our founding fathers knew it.  Motor-voter laws are a mistake, anyone can mail in a piece of paper and be allowed to vote without proving who they are or if they are citizens.  It comes down to two very important facts:</p>
<p>1) Allowing people to vote who have no stake or investment in the nation (such as welfare recipients or prisoners) just gives you voters who will NEVER vote for the common good.  </p>
<p>2) Easy voter registration, letting almost anyone vote cheapens citizenship.  When a people no longer value their citizenship they no longer value their nation.</p>
<p>Who in their right mind could possibly believe that allowing bums, crooks and illegal aliens to vote could possibly result in anything but chaos.<br>

		<p>The 9th Circuit Court is notorious for its loony left wing rulings.  I hope this one is successfully appealed (although the odds of that are reduced by the presence of Sotomayer on the Supreme Court).  Any black person can preserve his voting rights by the simple action of not committing a felony.  But this is too much for the Muhammad Shabazz Farrakhans of the world.  (By the way, what are the odds that a person with a name like that <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> be a criminal?)</p>
<p>Anonymous in #3 wrote: <i>I also believe that IQ tests should be implemented to determine eligible voters: a minimum score of 100 should be necessary to be able to vote.</i></p>
<p>I would settle for a simple test of reading comprehension.  But it doesn&rsquo;t matter, any such criterion will have disparate impact, as not enough blacks are able to parse a sentence.  So it would never be allowed.<br>

		<p>You just canot overstate the demented, psychotic illogic of the liberal mind. Clearly, there is a Lemming instinct here, and Liberals will complete their suicide, no matter what happens.<br>
They intend to take all whites with them.<br>
Blacks commit more crimes, and are proportionately jailed. <br>
We rightly concluded long ago that felons should lose the right to vote.<br>
But not black ones, the Lemmings say. They&rsquo;ll make sure that criminals-and the most violent ones at that- decide who leads them. And they&rsquo;ll make sure that in cities like chicago, there are no requirements for who can serve as police officers or firemen. And wherever IQ tests show black inferiority, said tests will be abolished. <br>
Inferiors shall rule, decide who rules, police, &#8220;protect,&#8221;, and populate the highest halls of education. They will be the generals, the highest administrators in government.<br>
Putting blacks in control is tantamount to playing Russian Roulette with six slugs in the cylinder. <br>
Liberals will blow their own brains out&hellip;it is a genetic thing.<br>
  One day, scientists will recognize that White Liberals represented a human instinct to cull the herd&hellip;self-deselection.<br>
Thank God not all whites have this gene.</p>

		<p>Convicted felons cannot vote unless they live in Maine or Vermont, traditionally liberal states, or unless voting rights are restored to them.</p>
<p>Convicted felons cannot own guns, run businesses that serve alcohol, practice professions like law, medicine, or banking, cannot visit certain countries like Great Britain or Canada, unless granted a visa, if at all, and are subject to other restrictions, along with persons who have been dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Armed Forces.</p>
<p>Martha Stewart, Ivan Boesky, and Bernard Madoff are examples that even the rich are not above the law.  For example, Martha was denied a convicted felon visa to visit Great Britain.  Where as, if you are not a convicted felon, you only need a passport to visit Great Britain</p>
<p>Not to mention it is very difficult for such people to find employment, even in jobs they are allowed to do.</p>
<p>From what I have learned, white people despise convicted felons, with exceptions like Martha Stewart. But blacks make heros out of convicted felons.</p>
<p>During my High School years I was not aware of these consequences of being a convicted felon that do not end upon release from prison.  Even though I am white, I sometimes thought of prison as a possible career option, when I was in High School. I was quite ignorant during my High School years.<br>
Fortunately, I stayed on the right side of the law!</p>
<p>We need to teach our young people of how the consequences of becoming a convicted felon, or a dishonorable discharge from the U.S. Armed Forces, last a lifetime, unless one can get a pardon from the President of the USA.  But in getting a Presidential pardon, one has as much chance as winning the lottery!</p>

		<p>Florida does not allow convicted felons to vote without jumping through firey hoops being juggled by a drunk. It was not always that way. When you finished your sentence they gave you an orange card saying that you had maxed out and your rights were restored except fire arms ownership.Nobody paid attention to the law that made this illeagal. I always greeted my losses as they got out of the joint. I treated them to a steak dinner and then got their driver`s liscences restored. I would then take them to the voter ofice. The clerks would scratch their heads but always signed them up. For years the toughest of my clients ended up as  the Sergant of Arms for the League of Woman Voters. Crazzies always show up at their meetings to cause trouble.<br>
     These fellows never got busted again, not one. Some even served on juries and were murder on their old pals. I know this number about 40 makes no statistical sense, but the pride of going to the polls didn`t hurt them. Black or white it didn`t matter. Today when a punk gets out, there is nothing welcoming back into society. If everybody treats you like a punk, guess what you will continue to be?<br>

		<p>My husband is a correctional officer at Walla Walla State Penetentiary. We live in the town of Walla Walla, WA. The town is 2.58% African American. The penetentiary is 69% African American. This is a farming town in Eastern Washington and we do not want or need these degenerate criminals from all over the state voting in either local or national elections. The ones who are paroled are not encouraged to stay here for obvious reasons. Criminals gave up their rights to vote when they committed the crime that put them behind bars. They do not deserve to vote while serving their sentences. Giving them the right to vote would certainly &#8220;dilute the electorial clout&#8221; of this town, and we don&rsquo;t want it  &mdash;  not that what we wanted ever mattered to those in government, anyway.  </p>

<p>Did these states actually pass such a law? Most of this nonsense is handed down to us by the Courts, who can endlessly stretch the Constitution to accomodate any outlandish theory that suits them.</p>
<p>For the things that the masses won&rsquo;t accept, the Courts are used as a hammer to subvert the democratic process and implement &#8220;enlightened&#8221; changes that the masses are too bighearted and too stupid to implement i.e. abortion, desegregation, birth rite citizenship etc.</p>

		<p>In South Africa, until very recently, legally registered voters residing in other countries, for example the more than 1 million whites who are working overseas, could not vote. All criminals, also those currently in jail, have been able to vote since 1994. Doesn&rsquo;t that just say it all? </p>

		<p>A convicted federal felon, my own voting rights automatically came back after I had been released and completed probation.  I didn&rsquo;t have a problem with this.</p>
<p>Most states, Colorado included, automatically return voting rights after probation or parole is finished.  The only states where felons are barred from voting for life are Florida and Kentucky.  For foreign travel, the only two off-limits nations are Australia and Canada.  Great Britain does allow convicted US felons in, but not while they are on probation or parole.  I hope this clears things up.</p>

<p>Luckily, the WA state legislature did not pass this law.  The felons found a shyster and ran it through the Federal judiciary.  The Federal circuit court at Spokane found for the state, and the felons appealed this to the appellate circuit, in this case, the nutty ninth.  Now, the state will probably appeal this decision to SCOTUS, and since the 9th is the most overturned appellate circuit, I get a feeling SCOTUS might overturn, except it&rsquo;s got Sotomayor now.</p>
<p>In the last few years though, WA did make it slightly easier for convicted felons to vote.  Before, they had to wait before prison time, probation/parole was through and fines and restitution in arrears were paid.  What WA did was to take away the fines/restituion part, meaning that all you had to do was get off probation.  Even that wasn&rsquo;t good enough for some people.</p>

		<p>It seems that all I ever read about are waived standards, reduced standards, omitted standards, eliminated standards, lowered standards, cancelled standards, and no standards where Blacks are concerned. I have seen no evidence whatsoever in many years that Blacks are held to any form of established standards.</p>
<p>Can anyone cite a single case in America today that proves that Blacks are held to any established standards? </p>
<p>When I look at a black doctor, dentist, astronaut, professor, teacher, policeman, fireman, mailman, pilot, officer, student, or truck driver, I immediately know that he (or she) has not met any of the established standards that are required for such positions. I instantly recognize that their assigned titles and positions are merely honorary in nature; presented to honor their skin color. </p>
<p>Blacks are certainly not real doctors, dentists, etc. The Whites around them have to make up the differences for the incompetencies they bring to their respective teams, offices, etc. I hope you all realize that.</p>
<p>Can anyone site a single example of Blacks adhering to any established standards in education, criminal justice, employment, or any walk of life? If so, then I will gladly admit that I am wrong.</p>

<p>There is not really such a thing as &#8220;crime&#8221; and there are no legitimate political issues among blacks.  Every anti-social behavior and every vote has only one purpose&hellip;.to harm whites.  To take from us, displace us, and eventually kill us.</p>
