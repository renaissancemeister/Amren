<h1>City&rsquo;s Wells Fargo Lawsuit Dismissed</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tricia Bishop, Baltimore Sun, January 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal court judge on Wednesday dismissed Baltimore&rsquo;s landmark lawsuit against Wells Fargo &amp; Co., saying it was &#8220;not plausible&#8221; that the mortgage giant triggered millions of dollars in damages, as the city claimed, by causing increased foreclosures through racist, predatory lending.</p>
<p>&#8220;The alleged connection is even more implausible when considered against the background of other factors leading to the deterioration of the inner city,&#8221; U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz explained in a six-page memorandum opinion accompanying the dismissal order. He pointed specifically to Baltimore&rsquo;s &#8220;extensive unemployment, lack of educational opportunity and choice, irresponsible parenting, disrespect for the law, widespread drug use, and violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Comparable cases, seeking compensation for alleged foreclosure losses, in Cleveland and in Birmingham, Ala., were also dismissed in their districts.</p>
<p>Motz&rsquo;s dismissal essentially said Baltimore did not have the proper &#8220;standing&#8221;  &mdash;  basically the right  &mdash;  to sue because it didn&rsquo;t effectively show a causal connection for its wide-ranging claims, which alleged &#8220;tens of millions&#8221; of dollars in losses.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Reverse redlining&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Baltimore&rsquo;s lawsuit was said to be the first of its kind when it was filed in January 2008. It, like others, claimed Wells Fargo targeted minority borrowers for bad loans  &mdash;  an illegal practice known as &#8220;reverse redlining&#8221;  &mdash;  which allegedly led to defaults and a disproportionately high rate of foreclosures and vacancies in black or Latino neighborhoods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But city attorneys proffered affidavits of former Wells Fargo employees as evidence. And they promised to quantify the exact damages incurred. Through arguments, they claimed the reverse redlining was real and that it caused millions in losses through:</p>
<p>* More abandoned homes.<br>
* Lower property values and tax revenue.<br>
* A rise in criminal activity and law enforcement expenditures.<br>
* An increase in social services fees and construction rehabilitation costs.</p>
<p>But the judge was skeptical of the scope of the city&rsquo;s claims. Baltimore has as many as 30,000 vacant homes, according to the original complaint, but so far, the city has identified only 80 vacancies related to Wells Fargo in African-American neighborhoods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus, using the City&rsquo;s own figures,&#8221; Motz wrote, &#8220;Wells Fargo is responsible for only a negligible portion of the City&rsquo;s vacant housing stock.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wells Fargo has said there are too many possible factors to show what caused a vacancy, including the economy, unemployment or divorce.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>More lawsuits filed</b></p>
<p>&#8220;From the beginning, we have consistently maintained that Baltimore&rsquo;s economic problems could not be attributed to the negligible number of foreclosures Wells Fargo has done in Baltimore,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Judge Motz&rsquo;s decision appears consistent with that belief, Heiden added, as do the decisions in Birmingham and Cleveland.</p>
<p>Still, the lawsuits keep coming. The state of Illinois filed a comparable case in July, and Memphis, Tenn., filed a suit last week.</p>

		<p>These lawsuits are pretty ridiculous.  If they did not loan to low-income minorities, they would be sued.  But now that they loaned to low income minorities, they got sued.  It&rsquo;s kind of like how if white people move out of black neighborhoods, it is racist white flight, but if they move into black neighborhoods, it is racist gentrification.  It is impossible to win.  No matter how hard whites try to appease these race hustlers, they will never stop.</p>

		<p>Now, I was in the Baltimore-DC corridor (Herald Harbor, MD to be exact) in 1966-7 when my husband was drafted for the Viet Nam war and stationed at Ft. George G. Meade in Laurel, MD.  I can tell you that when we went to visit the Baltimore waterfront, there was NOTHING THERE except some broken-down piers and it wasn&rsquo;t safe to walk there because the wood was rotting.  I have seen pictures since of the waterfront area and it&rsquo;s unrecognizable because it&rsquo;s so much better.  I can just imagine that the same has happened to the &#8220;inner city&#8221; of Baltimore, and that it today doesn&rsquo;t even slightly resemble that which I saw 44 years ago.  Point being, there may be a lot of foreclosures, but that would be on HOUSES, not on the wooden shacks that were there way back then.  Not only that, but the first 2 things I saw in Laurel, MD in 1966 were (a) a highway sign that said, &#8220;Vote Republican - the (N-word) Party!!&#8221;  (The Democrat George Mahoney was running for Governor on a segregation ticket, versus Spiro Agnew the Republican); (b) a motel that had a sign saying &#8220;Colored Cabins.&#8221;  I didn&rsquo;t know what that meant, being from CA - pastels?  Remember that Baltimore was a HOLE in the ground 44 years ago, and despite foreclosures, give SOME credit to progress, please!!</p>

		<p>Odoacer is right, it is certain that had Wells Fargo not made loans to blacks who couldn&rsquo;t afford them they would have been sued for redlining.  </p>

		<p> Your quite correct Odoacer, there is no way White America can appease the race hustlers, because the minorities don&rsquo;t want to &#8220;get along&#8221; - they only strive for the predation of Whites, and if anyone speaks up their labled racist, which ends all discussion. But lets make it clear that Wells Fargo is NOT representative of White America - far from it.<br>
 Wells Fargo is very much indicative of the predetory attitude that has replaced the moral attitude this country was founded on. There are no ethics is business anymore - greed is god now.</p>

		<p> If the goverment forces you to loan to low income minorities under threat of legal action and you do as your told the sane bank flips that mortgage at the earliest opportunity to Freddie Mac and Fanny Mae and escapes the inevitable foreclosure. That&rsquo;s just common sense.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Baltimore. Except for military deployments, I&rsquo;ve lived here my entire 37 years. You unfortunately observed an isolated, soda-straw view of a once-great city. </p>
<p>To see pictures of this city &#8220;pre-invasion&#8221; is to simply be stunned. Marble steps, banking, street cars, Lexington Market, Memorial Stadium, Druid Park Lake, Brooks Robinson, Johnny Unitas&hellip;on and on and on. Watch either of these movies: &#8220;Tin Men&#8221; or &#8220;Avalon.&#8221; </p>
<p>And then&hellip;1964. Title VII. Affirmative action. A homicide count over 200 every year. Zach Sowers beaten to death. A five-year-old shot in the head. Hometown of the &#8220;Stop Snitching&#8221; video. </p>
<p>Baltimore was a great place, but nothing cures greatness like a little &#8220;diversity.&#8221;<br>
