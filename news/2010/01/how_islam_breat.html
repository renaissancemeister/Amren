			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John J. O&rsquo;Neill, Jihad Watch, January 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In my newly-published book, Holy Warriors: Islam and the Demise of Classical Civilization, I argue at length that a great majority of the things commonly regarded as &#8220;Medieval&#8221; were in fact introduced to Europe from Islam, and that it was Islam, and not the Huns, Vandals and Goths, which terminated Classical Civilization, the rational and humane civilization of Greece and Rome. This civilization survived in Europe and in North Africa and the Near East until the seventh century, at which point it was terminated by the Muslim conquests.</p>
<p>In point of fact, Islam&rsquo;s influence upon Europe was much greater than is commonly imagined, but that influence was entirely negative. Not only did the Muslims terminate Classical Civilization, but they dragged Europe, on many levels, down to a more barbarous level of culture. It was from the Muslims, for example, that Christian Europeans got the idea of &#8220;Holy War,&#8221; a concept that would have been unthinkable in earlier centuries. And from Islam too, the institution of slavery, as well as the slave trade, received a new and powerful impetus.</p>
<p>Contrary to the beliefs of some modern anti-Christian writers, Christianity brought an immediate and dramatic improvement in the living conditions of slaves in the Roman Empire. It was also, eventually, instrumental in the abolition of the entire institution. The improvement was an inevitable consequence of the Christian notion that the mistreatment of any human being, whether slave or free, was gravely sinful. In the words of one writer, &#8220;The effect of the Church upon the Empire may be summed up in the word &#8216;freedom&rsquo;.&#8221; (H. F. Stewart, &#8220;Thoughts and Ideas of the Period,&#8221; in The Cambridge Medieval History: The Christian Empire, Vol. 1 (2nd ed. 1936), p. 592) And, &#8220;Close upon the Church&rsquo;s victory follows legislation more favorable to the slave than any that had gone before.&#8221;(Ibid.) Whilst it is true that &#8220;Constantine did not attempt sudden or wholesale emancipation, which would have been unwise and impossible,&#8221; he nevertheless immediately &#8220;sought to lessen his [the slave&rsquo;s] hardships by measures which with all their inequalities are unique in the statute-book of Rome.&Nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he forbade cruelty towards slaves in terms which are themselves an indictment of existing practice.&#8221;(Ibid., p. 593) The Gospel passages of relevance here are too numerous to mention, but we should note in particular the story of the Final Judgment as told in Mark 25: 31-46, where the King (God) tells His servants: &#8220;So long as you did it to these, the least of my brethren, you did it to me.&#8221; It should be remarked also, at this point, that the whole concept of human rights, attributed by many contemporary westerners to the thinkers of the Enlightenment, is rooted in this Gospel concept  &mdash;  a fact admitted by the Enlightenment philosophers themselves. Human rights are a moral as well as a judicial concept. If God will hold each of us accountable for our behavior towards the lowliest members of society, this places the latter on a par, in moral terms, with the highest members of society.</p>
<p>Thus from the start, the lives of slaves improved. This was especially the case with female and younger male slaves, whose function, in the past, was very often to provide sexual pleasure for their owners. This type of transgression was especially frowned upon by Christians. And so, whilst the owning of slaves was not, to begin with, illegal, mistreatment  &mdash;  from the very start  &mdash;  was. This view led, inexorably, to the abandonment and abolition of the entire slave system. We find therefore, from the earliest times, many Christian leaders, such as Gregory of Nyssa and John Chrysostom, condemning slavery itself and calling for better treatment for slaves. In fact, tradition describes Pope Clement I (92  &mdash;  99), Pope Pius I (roughly 158  &mdash;  167) and Pope Callixtus I (217  &mdash;  222) as former slaves.</p>
<p>After Christianity became the official religion of the Empire the more noxious manifestations of slavery, such as gladiatorial contests, were one by one abolished; and finally, with the Corpus of laws promulgated by Justinian, in the sixth century, we find a formal condemnation of the institution. {snip}</p>
<p>The Justinianic code was introduced into Italy (in 554), from where it was to pass to Western Europe in the twelfth century and become the basis of much European law. It passed also to Eastern Europe where it appeared in Slavic editions, and became the cornerstone of Russian law.</p>
<p>The end result of all this was that by the tenth or even ninth century the Church had effectively ended slavery in Europe. And this is a fact well-known. In the words of Rodney Stark, &#8221; &hellip;  slavery ended in medieval Europe only because the church extended its sacraments to all slaves and then managed to impose a ban on the enslavement of Christians (and Jews). Within the context of medieval Europe, that prohibition was effectively a rule of universal abolition.&#8221; (Rodney Stark, The Victory of Reason (Random House, New York, 2005) p. 28)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Islamic custom and practice with regard to slavery was always diametrically opposed to that of Christianity: {snip} Thus for example after the slaughter of the male members of the Jewish tribe of Banu Quraiza Muhammad took one of the most beautiful female captives as a concubine; whilst other successful military exploits of the Prophet invariably involved his procuring of slaves. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Muslim advance through the Middle East and North Africa meant the re-establishment, on a massive scale, of the slave trade, a trade which the Christian rulers of the late Roman Empire, particularly Justinian, had almost brought to an end. {snip}.</p>
<p>In Holy Warriors I describe in detail the devastating effect of Muslim raids at this time across the Mediterranean world. The latter sea became a war-zone, and normal trade came to an end. One type of trade alone survived: the trade in human bodies. And the devastation was not confined to southern Europe. The north of the continent became quickly involved in the general ruin: For that strange phenomenon, the Viking expansion, was intimately and directly related to the arrival of Islam. Hugh Trevor-Roper puts it thus: &#8220;{snip} It used to be supposed that it was merely a sudden, unexplained growth of population in Scandinavia which lay behind this extraordinary outburst. No doubt this was true: so vast an expansion cannot have been sustained by a static population. But the scope and direction of the raids point also to other motives. There were opportunities abroad as well as pressures at home; and these opportunities link together the Viking raids and the Moslem conquests.&#8221; (Hugh Trevor-Roper, The Rise of Christian Europe (London, 1966) p. 90).</p>
<p>Trevor-Roper goes on to describe the vast wealth accumulated by the Muslim Caliphate in its expansion across Asia and Africa, and how, with this wealth, it could purchase what it wanted from Europe. What the Muslims wanted, above all, was &#8220;eunuchs and slaves.&#8221; He continues: &#8220;It was one of the functions of the Vikings to supply these goods. Half traders, half pirates, they ranged over all northern Europe, and in their ranging, or through the method of piracy, they collected furs and kidnapped human beings. For preference they dealt in heathen Slavs, since Christian States had less compunction in handling a slave-trade in heathen bodies  &mdash;  they could always quote that useful text, Leviticus xxv, 44. So the Vikings fed both Byzantium and the rich new civilization of Islam with the goods which they demanded and for which they could pay. In doing so they penetrated all the coasts and rivers of Europe.&#8221; (Ibid., pp. 90-1) In the above quotation Trevor-Roper repeats the erroneous notion, prevalent until the last decades of the twentieth century, that Byzantium somehow escaped the ravages of the Saracens and that in her territory there continued to flourish an intact and prosperous branch of ancient Rome. {snip}</p>
<p>Whilst, as Trevor-Roper says, the majority of European slaves delivered to the Arabs were Slavs, not all of them were. Indeed, the Vikings plundered all of western Europe to supply the markets of the Caliphate. Dublin, for example, established by the Vikings in Ireland, was a major slave market, with most of the captives bought and sold coming from Ireland and Britain. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that the majority of slaves sold to the Muslims were heathen Slavs, and there is no doubt also that some of the Christian rulers of western Europe were complicit in the trade. {snip}</p>
<p>By the late tenth and eleventh centuries Scandinavia was converted to Christianity, and the slave trade came to an end in the north of Europe. In the south, however, it was a very different story. For centuries, in Spain, in Sicily, in Greece, and all along the Mediterranean coastlands, Muslim corsairs raided incessantly, capturing entire communities and selling them in the slave markets of Cairo, Damascus and Baghdad. Even worse, the Christian populations of southern Europe, especially of Spain and southern Italy, began to take on many of the habits and customs of their Islamic foes. These included the keeping and marketing of slaves. It is little surprise then, that the great revival of slave-trading, which marked the European colonization of the Americas, would be driven by freebooters from the Iberian Peninsula. And we should never forget that, to begin with, the Atlantic slave trade with the Americas was entirely a Spanish and Portuguese enterprise. The nations of northern Europe did not participate. Famously, Queen Elizabeth I of England initially refused to become involved, declaring the trade an outrage against God and humanity. Later however, probably corrupted by the example of the Spaniards and Portuguese, she changed tack and began Britain&rsquo;s involvement in the noxious trade.</p>
<p>Louis Betrand is scathing of the influence exerted upon Christian Spain by Islam. &#8220;The worst characteristic which the Spaniards acquired was the parasitism of the Arabs and the nomad Africans: the custom of living off one&rsquo;s neighbour&rsquo;s territory, the raid raised to the level of an institution, marauding and brigandage recognized as the sole means of existence for the man-at-arms. In the same way they went to win their bread in Moorish territory, so the Spaniards later went to win gold and territory in Mexico and Peru. {snip}&#8221; (Louis Betrand and Sir Charles Petrie, The History of Spain (2nd ed. London, 1945), p.&nbsp;160).</p>

		<p>Well in actuality the Koran also encouraged kindness towards slaves and put other restrictions on the practice and that is was sparked the large scale slave trade. If the Koran had NOT put so many restrictions on slavery there would have been no reason to start collecting slaves in large quantities from foreign (non-Muslim) lands and selling them off around the world. </p>
<p>The Koran encouraged that slaves be released in penance for sins, that slave girls be allowed to marry free men (which made them free women) and most importantly, forbids turning Muslims into slaves (barring the creation of local slaves in war).</p>
<p>The Koran put forth the same messages regarding slaves as is found in the Bible, but smart Arab traders found a loophole. The Europeans could have simply refused to buy if the idea offended their Christian sensibilities all that much.</p>

		<p>HOWEVER:  much later in history, in 1453 to be exact, Constantinople experienced a deadly incursion of Turks (Muslims), sending the classical (of Greek and Rome) scholars northward into Italy, thus precipitating the advent of the Renaissance.  Ergo - while Constantinople was suffering under the Moslem plunderers, Europe began one of its brightest periods of learning.  Certainly the Catholic Church, accustomed to being the prime authority in Europe, fought against this new freedom to explore and accrue knowledge, but it was unstoppable.  So the Muslims at least had one positive function:  a goad to the later brilliant development of all of Europe, and later the New World.</p>

		<p>blacks convert to Islam because they are looking for straightforward answers to the problems of life at a time when the Christian church is sinking into antinomianism and seems unable to provide them. Perhaps if there were an equivalent to Opus Dei targeted at blacks, they would have converted to that just as easily. While they are not necessarily capable of understanding theology involved, the idea of signing up to live an organized life while serving the one true cause is one that is quite attractive to many people, teenagers and blacks amongst them.</p>

<p>Well, my perception is that this is absolutely correct. Understanding beyond that Islam is perceived by the black as a &#8220;get whitey&#8221; religion is not required. That most Muslims are non-white and the religion is in conflict with the western &#8220;whitey&#8221; civilization is all that is needed for the American black. </p>

<p>My reaction too. Jefferson Davis owned slaves, and the American south was therefore BAD. Mohammad [the ideal man!!] owned slaves, but Islam is not bad?? What gives with that.</p>
<p>Such inherent contradictions are not of concern to the mind of the American black??</p>

		<p>Re #4 comment: I believe that American blacks become Moslems (especially in prison) because Islam is presented to them as anti-white and anti-Western.  Converts can shed their &#8220;slave names&#8221; and adopt interesting new monikers.  <br>
For most American blacks, Christianity still offers plenty.</p>

 <br>
Believe that if you must. Blacks become Muslims because to them it&rsquo;s a hate Whitey club. To them it&rsquo;s like a gang except that it has the Blessing of Allah which then validates violence and misogyny and as an added bonus, they get to play dress up.<br>

<p>I respectfully disagree. Blacks convert to islam because, in most cases, they don&rsquo;t know the true muslim opinion of blacks. They also mostly convert in prison which is a way to get free stuff and special dispensation! On the outside, they are now able to include &#8220;religious persecution&#8221; in their litany of Ghetto lottery possibilities which increases their liklihood of WINNING the ghetto lottery. Witness how many blacks (especially women) come apply for a job as common Shaniqua, get the job and THEN show up in abaya or Burqa!! Then the employers problems really begin.</p>

		<p>On the subject of black prison inmates and Islam:</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s mostly a prison gang.  Many black &#8220;converts&#8221; don&rsquo;t stick with it once they&rsquo;re released.  And most of those who do are doing it because they want to conceal the criminal record and/or bad debts collected under their birth name.</p>
<p>I have not yet been able to corroborate this, but I have heard that efforts to spread Islam in American prisons were Libyan and Quadaffi financed, to create a fifth column or a distraction in the United States.</p>

<p>This is the version of history usually repeated by those who have an anti-Christian bias. But it makes little sense. <br>
The rediscovery of the Greek language was only one of many factors in the intellectual advancement of Western Europe. Don&rsquo;t give it more weight than it deserves.<br>
Oddly, the myth that the &#8220;Italian Renaissance&#8221; was the watershed that suddenly got Europe out of the &#8220;Dark Ages&#8221; is more common among North Europeans than Italians. Sure, we Italians like to talk about the Italian Renaissance - it inflates our own pride. But we also know that there is no true discontinuity between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. If you consider all the Italian accomplishments (intellectual, economical, artistic) from the 11th century invention of the compass (independently from China, sorry), all the way up to Galileo, they are nicely spread from the 11th to the 17th century. Sure there were a number of intellectual revolutions in the 15th century, but there are intellectual revolutions in every century, and even paradigm shifts are part of a gradual progression.<br>
That is also true of the whole of Europe. France, England and the Low Countries were very vital and rapidly advancing in the period between the Norman Conquest and the outbreak of the Hundred Years War. The univiersities of Paris and Oxford had a string of intellectual accomplishments, and Gothic art flourished. It is only with the hundred years war, worsened by the Black Plague and other disasters, that North-West Europe got backwards. The Italian Renaissance is the name North Europeans give to the 15th-16th century period in which Italy was ahead of North-West Europe.<br>
It&rsquo;s important to recognize this, because the period of Europan advancement begins in the 10th-11th century at the time that the Church asserted it hegemony in Europe, christianizing the Norse and Magyars, expelling the Muslims from Italy, and beginning the reconquest of the Mediterranean. At the larger scale, it&rsquo;s ridiculous to say that the Church was a major enemy of progress. In one way or the other, the Church was behind most of the major accomplishment of medieval-early renaissance Europe - because it sponsored universities, sponsored art, and limited the infighting among Christians. The Church only was regressive force at the time of the heliocentrism issue, and even then, don&rsquo;t overextimate the weight of that individual issue.</p>

		<p>One wonders if the Muslims owe Europeans reparations for slavery? If white liberals can insist that Whites owe blacks reparations for slavery, then I imagine it works both ways. But I suspect we will not see the Congressional Black Congress demanding so much as an apology for slavery from Islamic countries. For some bizarre reason, the Muslims do not allow themselves to be shaken down in this manner. (I am, of course, being ironic.)</p>

<p>I find much of this article patently inacurrate.  The snippet above is perhaps one of the most available for a quick debunk.  Actual slavery, owning and trading outright, may have been ended, but serfdom continued.  Serfs were slaves, they could be bought,sold, and conquered with the land they lived on and were forbideen to leave.  Their lot was to farm and render to church and kind a large part of their produce.  They could not refuse church or royal command.  Their children were available for kidnap, permanent or temporary, usually for slaking the sexual appetites of kings and nobles, and they service at arms was mandetory in times of need.  Christianity was a tool for keeping them illiterate, docile, and pliable for exploitation.<br>
They may fare better or worse under a ruler, but the life of a commoner and especially a serf in those times was not the life of a free born human.  </p>
<p>The role of Vikings as slavers is exaggerated also.  If one studies their prominent centuries, it will become clear that slave trade was NOT their main purpose - settlement was.  They weren&rsquo;t plunderers as much as settlers.  Scandinavia had been warm and productive for some time and its expanding population needed living space.  They went in all directions (except maybe north).  One telling point in the debunk of Vikings as slavers is the fact that their longships could not transport very many beyond its own crew.  This author seems to rest his entire case upon one single known incident of a sale of some Irish captives to Moors by Vikings on the Irish coast.  But Christian kings also sold European captives to Moors, they didn&rsquo;t sail them down, either.  Dublin was a Viking settlement, not a slave trade center and any historian in Dublin will inform you of this today.  So was Waterford, and a good number of other Viking founded cities in Ireland. Northumbria in England is a well known Viking settled region as is Normandy, etc.</p>
<p>A factual study into the history of slavery shows that Moors and Phonecians before them were already slavers who raided European settlements all the way to Iceland, and they remainded slavers long after the Vikings.  They raided the coast of Italy so many times that cities became ghost towns and no one would rehabitate them for some time.  Vikings raided south and into the Mediterranean on adventures seeking treasures that old Greek rumors had fixed in their minds.  Many Vikings ended up as slaves themselves.</p>
<p>Christianity never actually came out against institutional slavery until after the fact.  The statement above &#8220;By the late tenth and eleventh centuries Scandinavia was converted to Christianity, and the slave trade came to an end in the north of Europe.&#8221;  False, Northern European reopened as slave traders in the 1600s.  Islam wants all to be slaves to Allah, but Christianity wants all to be slaves to Christianity.  I don&rsquo;t see much advantage in either as far as historical results go.  Give me the courageous, oath keeping Vikings any day.</p>

		<p>Hey, Italian, #11   &mdash;   I&rsquo;m Catholic, and am in no way against the Church (or Christianity, however you prefer to phrase it).  What I gave there is textbook, and does not reflect badly on the Church.  It is also a FACT that the Roman Catholic Church had been the primary power in every European country up until the Renaissance, when people, seeing what scholars in classical Greek and Roman arts had to offer, began to quietly question the Church&rsquo;s authority.  Then, in 1517, Martin Luther nailed up the 95 theses on the church door in Wittenburg, and the Reformation began.  And yes it IS a fact that the Church opposed scientific inquiry and advancement   &mdash;   remember Galileo???  Please.  I suppose every group has its pet theories, but I am a historian, from music history to be exact, and that is, from the earliest written music through the Counter-Reformation, a history of the Roman Catholic Church.  So, I don&rsquo;t have a beef with anybody, but I do try to report facts.  I will stand by what I have written here and in my first post.</p>

<p>I somewhat disagree with you.  I don&rsquo;t think their approach is so philosophical as you credit them.   I think you have missed the real point. </p>
<p>Blacks convert to Islam because they see it as an alternative to white, Christian culture. An alternative to Europe, that is.   Christianity is culturally and historically identified with Europe.   Converting to Islam  is <b>an act of rejection of everything that is white and European. </b> It is a slap in the face to Europe.  They don&rsquo;t necessarily love Islam so much as they hate Europe, and everything that Europe stands for.  Since Islam is already well established in Africa, and has been there for centuries, they see it as an African religion, which Christianity is not  (even though, to be technical, Christianity existed in Africa first).  Probably, their own ancestors were not Moslems (and maybe even were captured and sold by Moslems) but that is, to them, a minor point. In their general ignorance of their own history, they are able to overlook it. <b>The main point is to reject Whitey. </b></p>
<p>Another point is that Islam is a very simple religion to follow. Just say a few words and perform a few functions, and you&rsquo;re a Moslem.  Also, Islam allows polygamy and offers fleshy rewards that appeal to the physical senses.  Blacks can relate to that &hellip; no abstruse philosophy or Christian asceticism for them!</p>

		<p>&#8220;most of those are doing it because they want to conceal their criminal record and/or bad debts collected under their birth name.</p>
<p>I have not yet been able to corroborate this, but I have heard that efforts to spread Islam in American prisons were Libyan and Quadaffi financed, to create a fifth column or a distraction in the United States.&#8221;     &mdash;    QD<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>A fifth column indeed. You&rsquo;re exactly right.  I would not doubt that for a fraction of an instant. </p>
<p>But I admit that I had not thought about the advantages of concealment when they change their names. How handy for them!   I&rsquo;ve always  believed something should be done about this name-change racket anyway. This just confirms it.</p>

I agree with Whiteplight that the role  of Vikings as slavers is exaggerated.   The article also  displays, throughout, a clear  pro-Church bias.  (The Vikings were rapacious slave traders, up until they became Christianized; then they were suddenly Good Guys and stopped their bad old ways).</p>
<p>I also agree with Italian that the role of the refugees from Constantinople  is somewhat exaggerated, thus implying that we owe this boon to Islam.   At any rate, we certainly don&rsquo;t have Islam to &#8220;thank&#8221; for that!   Helping us to develop was hardly Islam&rsquo;s intention in conquering Constantinople.  Any benefits the West derived were purely accidental.  </p>
<p>He is right: Northern Europe, especially the Low Countries, had been &#8220;advancing rapidly in the centuries between the Norman Conquest and the Hundred Years War&#8221;,  well before the Italian Renaissance got underway.  This was the time of the Crusades and  the completion of the Spanish Reconquest.  These events probably had at least as much influence as anything else in encouraging (or forcing) Europe to think new thoughts and seek new development.</p>
<p>The progress of civilization, science, and learning were already well under way in Western Europe.  And the fact that the Turks did not (could not) advance further, despite all their attempts,  proves that. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not bringing up &#8220;pet theories&#8221; as there are major scholars who argue for the &#8220;continuity thesis&#8221; (look it up on Wikipedia) that Europe really took off in the Middle Ages and not in the misleadingly labelled Renaissance.<br>
I&rsquo;m not Catholic (I&rsquo;m an atheist), I&rsquo;m trying to report facts too, and I obviously don&rsquo;t question that the Church was the primary power in Europe before the Reformation - in fact my point is that one of the reasons for the great advancement of Europe was precisely the leadership of the Church. So the fact that the history of music is the history of the Church, does support my thesis.<br>
If you read my post, I mentioned the Galileo issue in the very last sentence of the post, and I said that its importance is far overrated. It is probably the only one major issue in which the Church delayed progress, and not even very vigorously. One single case doesn&rsquo;t make a trend. And it didn&rsquo;t even happen in the time period we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>I know that your positions are &#8220;textbook&#8221;, and that is exactly the problem. Many biased positions are &#8220;textbook&#8221; - the idea that all the races are equally skilled is &#8220;textbook&#8221;, too.</p>

<p>Also, the Italian Renaissance didn&rsquo;t consist of people &#8220;questioning Church authority&#8221;. That is a Protestant-centric view of the Renaissance (and the link between the Italian Renaissance and Luther is very tenuous). I don&rsquo;t see Church authority being questioned in the Sistine Chapel.</p>
<p>You may say that the questioning of Church authority was &#8220;quiet&#8221;, but if you study Italian history, Church authority was questioned in every single century to a degree. Dante had no lack of historical figures to put in the circle of heretics.</p>

<p>By the way, why is it that music history is the history of the Catholic Church? I don&rsquo;t think that the Church was burning people for developing music independently. Instead, we should say that the Church was the only one to sponsor written music. I&rsquo;m trying to say that the Church, far from blocking progress, was a major catalyst for the rise of Europe.</p>

		<p>&#8220;At the larger scale, it&rsquo;s ridiculous to say that the Church was a major enemy of progress. In one way or the other, the Church was behind most of the major accomplishment of medieval-early renaissance Europe - because it sponsored universities, sponsored art, and limited the infighting among Christian.&#8221; Italian</p>
<p>  I agree the Church did sponsor much of the great art and science of the early Renaissance. I look upon it as a positive force at the end of the Roman Empire. While I dearly love much of classical antiquity, it&rsquo;s time was over in the era when Christianity became the state religion. The Catholic Church structure replaced the Roman civil administration. The unity of Christianity also was important in the formation of European states. Islam is more of an absolutist Eastern philosophy, which can be attractive in its more esoteric (Sufism) forms, but its literal interpretation is an enemy of modern progress and enlightenment.</p>

		<p>the Christian populations of southern Europe, especially of Spain and southern Italy, began to take on many of the habits and customs of their Islamic foes. These included the keeping and marketing of slaves. It is little surprise then, that the great revival of slave-trading, which marked the European colonization of the Americas, would be driven by freebooters from the Iberian Peninsula&hellip;.Quote.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This would explain the brutal treatment of natives &amp; then African slaves by the Spanish many of whom have very little idea that by fighting Islamic fanatics for 800 yrs would turn them into the very monsters they trying to get rid of, FYI there is a famous case of a Moorish King being slain by an African slave in southern Spain!</p>
