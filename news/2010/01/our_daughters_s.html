<h1>Our Daughters Should Not Be Cut</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lynn Harris, Salon, January 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>FGM [female genital mutilation] in the USA Some girls came back from this past winter break with Christmas loot, ski tans, still more to say about &#8220;Twilight: New Moon.&#8221; But others, women&rsquo;s health experts suspect, came back with deep, and literal, wounds to heal. According to human rights advocates and service providers, families in the U.S. who have immigrated from countries where female genital mutilation (FGM) is practiced often take their daughters home, when school is out, to be cut.</p>
<p>Yes, FGM is practiced  &mdash;  or at least planned  &mdash;  on U.S. soil, on girls in immigrant families who were born and/or raised here. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} While numerous countries, cities, and villages on other continents have made significant strides toward prohibiting and preventing the procedure  &mdash;  and while it&rsquo;s been outlawed by U.S. federal law since 1996 and is also illegal in 17 states  &mdash;  its practice by immigrant families here is, by all anecdotal reports, only increasing. Yet there remains practically no way to address it any way other than case by brutal, heartbreaking case. {snip}</p>
<p>FGM refers to several different traditional rite-of-passage practices in parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East that involve the cutting of female genitals  &mdash;  from a ceremonial pinprick to &#8220;clitoridectomy&#8221; to removal of part or all of the external genitalia  &mdash;  for non-medical reasons such as &#8220;to reduce woman&rsquo;s libido and help her resist &#8220;&#8216;illicit&rsquo; sexual acts.&#8221; Health consequences include severe pain and bleeding, hemorrhaging, chronic infection, infertility, painful intercourse, post-traumatic stress, pregnancy complications possibly fatal to the baby, and death of the victim herself. FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of women and girls, reflecting, as the World Health Organization puts it, a &#8220;deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and [constituting] an extreme form of discrimination against women.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>Yet only one case has been prosecuted in the United States, ever; the circumstances were so anomalous, however, that some advocates say it doesn&rsquo;t even really count. (&#8220;We always thought the first one would be a girl who bleeds to death, but that hasn&rsquo;t been the case,&#8221; says Bien-Aime.) Most U.S.-based cases of FGM, or its threat, fly way under the radar  &mdash;  especially when its victims travel out of the country. Reporting, even addressing it at all, is stymied by its deep cultural entrenchment and misplaced &#8220;sensitivity&#8221; by some outsiders. And, of course, the practice affects primarily girls of color, poor ones at that: pretty much as marginalized and bottom-rung as you get.</p>
<p>Consider New York, whose metropolitan area is considered to have the highest number of women and girls potentially affected by cutting. In the past, New York City&rsquo;s Administration for Children&rsquo;s Services has worked with Sauti Yetu Center for African Women in the Bronx to provide community forums and awareness trainings for ACS staff  &mdash;  but no more. In fact, an ACS spokesperson said that &#8220;the issue of FGM has rarely if ever come across our work in New York City.&#8221; Today, search for &#8220;female genital&#8221; at nyc.gov, and you get a bunch of stuff about STDs. New York state law bans FGM of minors, criminalizing both the person who performs the procedure as well as the parent or guardian who OKs it. The law also requires the state Office of Children and Family Services to establish &#8220;education, preventive and outreach&#8221; activities in communities where FGM is traditionally practiced. According to reports, however, not much of that has happened in a decade; officials confirmed that there is no particular program in place today. {snip}</p>
<p>Much of the work of intervention has therefore fallen to advocacy groups like Equality Now, along with community-based and service organizations such as Sauti Yetu and Sanctuary for Families (SFF). Sanctuary for Families does outreach through schools and community groups, trying to educate both girls and the adults they see  &mdash;  teachers, guidance counselors  &mdash;  about the risks and realities of FGM, offering (for one thing) in-school clinics that give girls the opportunity to raise the issue. &#8220;We ask if any students would like to meet with lawyers who can answer questions about immigration and then we raise the issue one-on-one if it seems relevant, based on their country of origin,&#8221; explains Pyati. &#8220;We might learn that they&rsquo;re afraid, or that they have a classmate who is.&#8221; Sanctuary asks guidance counselors to reassure students that any conversation they have with a Sanctuary lawyer will be confidential, and works to &#8220;make sure they know that FGM is a very serious form of violence,&#8221; says Pyati [Archana Pyati, an asylum attorney for Sanctuary for Families].</p>
<p>While school officials are mandated reporters of child abuse, possible cases of FGM may give them  &mdash;  and other adults in a position to suspect it  &mdash;  pause. Is it a &#8220;cultural&#8221; practice that others somehow must respect? Is reporting it anti-Muslim? Will a child be summarily removed from her home  &mdash;  from an otherwise loving family who bears no other threat of violence? Such concern are misplaced, says Pyati. For one thing, FGM is a social custom, not a religious practice. Also, reporting a suspicion of child abuse does not always or automatically result in separation of the family in question. That said, &#8220;It&rsquo;s a mistake to assume that FGM is a stand-alone event,&#8221; she says. &#8220;FGM, a serious violation of human rights, is performed in a context of discrimination and violence against women. Where a girl&rsquo;s rights are so compromised that she has to undergo a painful procedure that is potentially life-threatening and carries life-long physical and psychological consequences, it can indicate that other forms of abuse may be ongoing.&#8221; Physical and psychological abuse may be used to force a girl to submit to FGM; FGM may be a way of preparing a girl for a marriage against her will, to which she has no right to object. And once she is married, her family may force her to bear children, have sex and endure other gender-related violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And at the level of law enforcement, advocates say, bans on the procedure stateside don&rsquo;t go nearly far enough. There are &#8220;circumcisers&#8221; who do the job in the U.S., hush-hush, a whole series in one afternoon, says Bien-Aime [Taina Bien-Aime, executive director of Equality Now.]. But if we&rsquo;re not catching them, how are we to track those who perform the procedure on U.S. girls in to their home countries? Only Georgia and Nevada&rsquo;s anti-FGM laws include so-called &#8220;vacation provisions,&#8221; which criminalize the removal of a child from the state to subject her to FGM. Advocates say such provisions must be universal.</p>
<p>Even then, prosecution, or at least protection, would still be dependent on someone speaking up, someone dropping a dime. In the UK, France, and Belgium, for example, women&rsquo;s groups who work with refugees will call partner grassroots groups in Senegal or Mali to let them know that one of their families is heading home with their daughter. The local African group will meet that family at the airport, follow them to their village, and warn them that their daughters had better stay &#8220;intact&#8221; or their papers will be compromised. &#8220;We are light years away from that,&#8221; says Bien-Aime. &#8220;No one says it&rsquo;s easy or not sensitive but you have to start someplace. We need to raise awareness with campaigns like those we&rsquo;ve seen for sexual harassment or domestic violence or anti-smoking,&#8221; she continues, noting that many immigrant families arrive here after spending years in refugee camps, unaware that their own countries have taken steps to end the practice. &#8220;All the relevant providers need to be in touch and know what FGM is and how to protect the girls, and where we punish those who perpetuate it. The law is a deterrent. All you need is one case to start the process.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t sound too different from African circumcisn.  That being said, if you bring third world people here you bring their customs as well.  These woman, who complain about FGM, are no doubt part of the same group that denigrates white men, American culture and promotes mass non-white immigration.</p>
<p>You can not have it both ways; you can not support multi-culturalism while at the same time criticizing certains aspects of other cultures.  Either you are respectful of all cultures or you believe in one.  Make up your minds liberals.</p>
<p>I say leave them to their own cultures in their own lands.  What they do in their own homes is none of our business.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong, but that quote comes off to me as pretty much blaming Whites for this barbaric practice. But since we all know that the racist term &#8220;people of color&#8221; represents the entire worlds population, except for Whites, then Whites are the only people definitely excluded from participating in this evil butchery. Still it appears to me that the writer is trying to somehow blame Whites in his article. They mention the &#8220;victims&#8221; as being girls of color, yet they fail to mention those butchering these girls are men of color. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that people fiercly oppose FGM but don&rsquo;t open their mouths on male genital mutilation, especially in the USA, babies are being cut automatically after being born. I don&rsquo;t know the percentages but it&rsquo;s dropping due do Hispanic immigration I think.</p>

		<p>This practice is sickening, and I can see absolutely no excuse for allowing it to be continued.  I think every adult who allows their daughter to be subjected to this should be immediately and automatically sterilized, both male and female.  What&rsquo;s sauce for the goose is in fact sauce for the gander, and the punishment should fit the crime.  A male, contemplating the possibility of losing his testicles, might find the prospect discouraging, and just might do the right thing and leave his daughter alone.  Usually the women have already undergone the procedure; but if she could have no more children, she might also be persuaded to leave her innocent daughter(s) alone.</p>

		<p>Speaking from a woman&rsquo;s point of view, this procedure is absolutely barbaric. NO female should undergo such brutality, regardless of their race or country of origin.</p>
<p>Now having said that, this sort of thing is excatly what flies in the face of that &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221; nonsense. What THEY consider a social custom, WE consider savagery. If they insist on practicing such customs, stay in your own country. </p>

		<p>Female genital mutilation is a barbarous practice, but I am more concerned with White girls being encouraged by MTV, public schools, and the general marxist establishment to get tatooed and pierced (and, of course, promiscuous).  These are just as disgusting and barbarous, and there was a time when Whites knew this.  But just as it is ingrained in the Arab that he must wipe out the Jews, the marxist want to destroy the White race.  Debasing potential mothers is just one of the weapon in their evil arsenal.</p>

		<p>Primitive cultures don&rsquo;t really have a concept of freedom.  The idea of freedom is Western.  Equality is Western also.  In primitive cultures, particularly in Africa, you just have to do what you&rsquo;re told.  You have no choice.  You just have to do it, whether you want to or not.  Children fear their parents and women show deferrence to their husbands (read: masters).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because primitive cultures suck.  They&rsquo;re not as effective because people perform better when they&rsquo;re motivated to do something rather than when they&rsquo;re forced to do it.  Primitive women are not as good at parenting because they had children out of a sense of obligation rather than desire.  The patriarch just scares everyone into obedience.  That creates a relationship based on dependence, fear, and duty rather than real feelings of love and trust.  Two cheers for transatlantic slavery!</p>

		<p>Well, it&rsquo;s certainly true that they&rsquo;re not mutilating &#8220;our daughters,&#8221; but if these primitives want to live in &#8220;our country&#8221; they damn well better learn to abide by our rules.</p>
<p>We should no more tolerate female genital mutilation than we would the practices of cannibalism, ritual murder, or infanticide of female babies, however much these quaint customs are revered by other &#8220;cultures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Persons, and their accessories, guilty of these and any other  weird and savage rituals should be prosecuted to the full extent of US federal and state law.</p>

		<p>I recently read an interview with Ruth Rendell, a crime writer whom I greatly admire. She was appointed to the House of Lords for her literary ability, and not for any political concerns. Nonetheless, Lady Rendell has singlehandedly brought about the passage of legislation criminalizing the taking of young girls from Britain overseas for the purposes of FGM. (It is, of course, already a crime to have such mutilation done to them in Britain). This new crime carries a tariff of 18 years imprisonment.<br>
Lady Rendell was chagrined to have to point out that to date *no* prosecutions have ever been brought for either having girls taken abroad for FGM or having it done to them in Britain.<br>
I wonder why? The article clearly suggested that the police are terrified of prosecuting Muslims and are frightened of appearing to target Muslims. Good for Lady R.<br>
On a similar note, P.D. James (also a terrific crime writer appointed to the House of Lords for her literary abilities) recently interviewed the head of the BBC on British radio. Lady James, like Lady Rendell, is a very well-educated and well-mannered lady of the old school (which is probably why the BBC supremo agreed to be interviewed by her). However, Lady James challenged him forcefully on matters such as the dumbing-down of BBC programs, the left-wing bias of its reporting, and the outrageous salaries paid to its employees by the British taxpayer. In fact, she tore him to pieces. The inarticulate fool couldn&rsquo;t counter any of her arguments. It was a delight to behold.<br>
We have some good allies!</p>

		<p>Many of the same people who decry clitoridectomies in the Muslim world, consider tongue piercings, nipple piercings and vaginal piercings among Western women and girls, to be a &#8220;fashion statement&#8221;.</p>
<p>The only difference that I can see is that a clitoridectomy is done to girls who are too young to know the deal, whereas most women and girls who have their body parts pierced consciously make that decision.</p>
<p>I have no problem with clitoridectomies performed on Muslim girls in their country of origin.</p>

I don&rsquo;t know, but it seems that Black men have a high level of immunity to Feminism. For example, I recall that Feminists destroyed the careers of navy officers in the so called &#8220;Tail Hook&#8221; incident. This involved allegedly minor infractions while off duty. Feminists made Lorraine Bobbit a hero for mutilating her husband while he was sleeping. </p>
<p>But the Feminists are silent when Black men murder and mutilate women. Perhaps the Feminists will get around to Black men after they solve the White Man Problem.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, this may become our problem when these girls who live in this country end up marrying and having children. FGM narrows the birth canal which makes it difficult to have a vaginal delivery. Most of these mothers have c-sections, which are more expensive than vaginal delivery. A good number of these women are deemed refugees, which means that we as the taxpayers are paying for their deliveries. </p>

		<p>Although the article refers to girls/women who are immigrants or citizens, often those born and raised here, I could not help noticing that it repeatedly speaks of them as returning to their &#8220;home countries&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Home countries?  Excuse me!  What is that?  As I understand the term, if you are a citizen here, then THIS is your &#8220;home&#8221;, and none other.   If your real home is elsewhere, then you are not an American (or British, Canadian, whatever), no matter what your papers say.  If those African lands are their home countries, then they should be living there   &mdash;    &#8220;at home&#8221; where they belong. </p>
