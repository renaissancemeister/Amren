<h1>Pressure Mounts on Kaine to Give Felons Voting Rights</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William C. Flook, Washington Examiner, January 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gov. Tim Kaine, approaching his last week in office, is facing mounting pressure to restore the voting rights of hundreds of thousands of felons as one of his last acts as governor.</p>
<p>A coalition of religious and civil rights organizations is in talks with Kaine, a Democrat, to issue an executive order to remove the barrier for about 300,000 disenfranchised Virginians before he leaves the job on Jan. 16., as well as to initiate a policy to automatically restore felons&rsquo; voting rights after they&rsquo;re released from prison. The commonwealth and Kentucky are the only states in the union that permanently bar a felon from voting without the direct intervention of the governor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The incoming governor, Bob McDonnell, said on the campaign trail he believes &#8220;rights should be restored to certain nonviolent felons who have met very specific requirements, demonstrated that they have maintained a clean record, and are contributing members of society.&#8221; As governor, he said he would speed the review of petitions for voting-rights restoration by nonviolent felons.</p>
<p>The ACLU is buoyed by a recent decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that struck down a voter disenfranchisement law in Washington as a violation of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a daily reader, first time poster and actually, I agree with 90% of the views on this site, except this one. Voting rights to free men are just that&hellip; a right. No, they shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to vote when they&rsquo;re in prison, but after they&rsquo;ve paid their debt to society, and they no longer owe anything to society, they are citizens again. Bottom line is if you pay taxes, either sales tax or income tax, you should be afforded the right to vote. For better or worse, that&rsquo;s how a democracy is supposed to work.</p>

		<p>Tommy S your incorrect. First this is not a Democracy it is a Constitutional Republic. Second, the right to vote as defined in our Constitution belongs to property owners only. All you have to do is look at our last election to see the effects of a pure Democracy. This is the end result where the &#8216;have nots&rsquo; finaly out number the &#8216;haves&rsquo;.  Sorry. The disenfranchised, irresponsible, criminal or mental defective should never be allowed entry to a voting booth. EVER. It&rsquo;s the same thing as turning the wheel of a moving car over to a two year old child. The direction of our country and the safety of it&rsquo;s people is just to valuable a treasure. </p>

		<p>Conviction of crimes against the state automatically recinds citizenship.  This is one of the foundations of US. Citizenship is valuable to the laws.  When a person violates the law they have violated rights of citizenship.  This is vital to a nation of laws and of law abiding citizens.  Those who betray the laws are not deserving of the rights of citizenship.  This is basic social studies.  How did the idea of allowing criminals the vote happen????  Most likely political for needy criminal votes.  Name this party the crime party.   Get out of here already!  V</p>

		<p>2 Tommy S: There&rsquo;s room for principled disagreement here, but my feeling is that anyone who chooses to prey on other humans ought be hanged.  Just because the courts failed in their duty doesn&rsquo;t mean that the lucky felon ought be allowed an equal say in how the government ought be run.  Just because our Rulers decide that someone has paid for his crime doesn&rsquo;t mean that he really has.  </p>

		<p> I have long questioned the practice of using felonies to strip the rights away from citizens. What is not a felony today could be a felony tomorrow. Eating Trans-fats, smoking in public, not going sufficiently &#8220;green&#8221;&hellip; </p>
<p>Part of the problem is felony-flation. This category of crime used to be reserved for acts that were so bad they were worthy of being hanged. Now the various politically prominent outrages du jour have turned a plethora of former misdemeanors into felonies.</p>
<p> Not purchasing health insurance may be a felony soon, so should I loose my gun rights for resisting the unconstitutional law if it is passed? If a person commits a crime serious enough that he or she cannot be trusted to carry a gun, then that person should not be out on the street.</p>

		<p>We need to look at this from the democrat standpoint and what their real goal is. They aren&rsquo;t looking at reformed &ldquo;criminals&rdquo;. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really looking at prison inmates as the ultimate voting block.</p>
<p>Your average likely repeat offender who is out on the street is unreliable as a voter and most likely won&rsquo;t vote at all. </p>
<p>Prison inmates, on the other hand, are a whole different story. They&rsquo;ll vote just to do something a little different for a day and they&rsquo;ll vote for whoever promises to get them out soonest, promises the most perks, etc.</p>
<p>Can you imagine what a democrat would say at a prison campaign event?</p>
<p>Kaine would not be doing it if it would benefit any one other then democrats!</p>
<p>The left-wing group responsible for organizing the felons is an Obama ACORN-type group. The Virginia Organizing Project is a leftwing group in rural Virginia that functions like a Saul Alinsky &ldquo;community organizing&rdquo; group.</p>
<p>Their goal in this case is to get more convicts registered as Democrat Party voters to take back the state from the conservatives/Republicans.</p>
<p>They are also linked to the old Communist Party member founded Physicians for National Health Plan of QUENTIN YOUNG.Young is the man who is largely behind the &ldquo;healthcare reform&rdquo; program of Hillary Clinton and now Obama.</p>
<p>He was in the meeting at Bill Ayers house in Chicago where OBAMA was introduced as the politico who was going to run for Alice Palmer&rsquo;s Illinois State Senate seat.</p>
<p>Young was long ago identified as a member of the Communist Party USA, and later he moved into the Democratic Socialists of America, the newest marxist movement behind Obama.</p>
<p>Also in that meeting that Ayers and his terrorist wife Bernadine Dohrn hosted was another former CPUSA member/DSA member Milton Cohen (d) and Alice Palmer, whose CPUSA/Moscow connections were recently exposed in the &ldquo;Obama Files&rdquo; of New Zealand researcher Trevor Loudon.<br>
Search his name for the links.</p>
<p>You would be shocked to see how the web of leftist interlocking subversion has been spread throughout the US by the old alliance of Saul Alinsky (including Obama), the old SDS and Weathermen, and various marxist radicals from the New American Movement, Democratic Socialists Organizing Committee, and the Illinois Voters Project.</p>

		<p>I feel after they get out of jail they should have their rights 100% restored I say that because with the laws anymore it takes next to nothing to be charged as a Felon. If you believe like almost all parents did 40 years ago in spanking your children. Then very easily you could be charged with Domestic Violence. Guess what if your convicted you to will be a Felon.I&rsquo;ve personally known of people this has happened to</p>

		<p>I work with criminals; most of them live on some form of welfare, and supplement their respective &#8220;incomes&#8221; with the spoils of their criminal activity.  Allowing felons to vote will ensure the election of the politician offering the biggest handouts.  </p>

		<p>but after they&rsquo;ve paid their debt to society &hellip;</p>
<p>Nonsense. The purpose of incarcerating a criminal is to punish them for their crime(s). It costs society a considerable amount of tax dollars to incarcerate a convicted criminal. How on earth can a criminal &#8220;pay their debt to society&#8221; by incurring even more costs to said society, via their incarceration costs? Giving a miscreant the privilege to vote is an insult to the good productive citizens who actually make a society work.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t want people who have been convicted of murder, rape, child molestation and robbery or who are thugs, gang-bangers and drug runners voting while they are serving life sentences voting on who will be the next mayor, governor, president  &mdash;  or even town dogcatcher. I do not want them involved in setting the laws of the land, state or township where I live. They are criminals and they have no right being allowed to vote on anything. <br>
No. #7 said it best: &#8220;They&rsquo;re really looking at prison inmates as the ultimate voting block.<br>

		<p>Most of the comments on this story and a similar story from a few days earlier from Washington State have got me to thinking, i.e. weakening the world.</p>
<p>I would not allow convicted felons to vote.  However, I would make the pardon process significantly easier.  If you committed a relatively minor felony as a young adult, and you did it 20 years ago, and you&rsquo;ve been a decent citizen since the conviction/release/probation, then you should get pardoned.  If you have a long rap sheet starting at 17 and not ceasing over time, then you shouldn&rsquo;t get a pardon.</p>
<p>Also, I would be keen to the idea of automatically sunsetting a felony conviction of a relatively young person for a relatively minor felony after a certain number of years if the person have behaved well.  They wouldn&rsquo;t have to go through the pardon process to begin with.</p>
<p>The problem with my agenda here is this   &mdash;   We couldn&rsquo;t adopt it in today&rsquo;s crazy egalitarian climate.  For many more whites than blacks would qualify for either a pardon or an automatic sunset   &mdash;   Civil Rights groups would start whining, and demand and eventually get more pardons for blacks, to clean away more serious and/or multiple felonies committed well after young adulthood.</p>
<p>Another hitch is that the pardon process perturbs prosecutors (say that ten times in a row really quickly), b/c they think the President or Governor is undermining all their work with a stroke of an ink pen.  Any such plan of mine would be created with the cooperation and countenance of U.S. Attorneys and state DAs/CAs/SAs.  If you make them mad, then they&rsquo;ll lay down on prosecutions society really does need.</p>

		<p>When you commit a crime you are being punished.  One aspect of punishment is a loss of rights.  Is that so hard to undestand?</p>
<p>Universal sufferage has been a disaster.</p>

		<p>I used to hold the conservative viewpoint of being tough on crime with this denial of voting rights for felony convictions included.<br>
However, current sentiments predict that it is going to be more likely that whites will get convictions and given harsher penalties while blacks will be granted more leniency since there have been complaints regarding the preponderance of blacks in prison. <br>
For this reason I now think it will better for whites if felons are allowed to vote.<br>
Most black felons don&rsquo;t vote anyway unless Acorn goes after them or they are assigned into a suburban re-entry program and misguided liberals recruit them for the polls (i.e. feed them, pay them, drive them. What liberals always do at election time.)</p>

		<p>We have Criminals running every level of Government. Of course, it would be in their better interest to restore the privilege of the Right to Vote to those Criminals, either currently incarserated, or recently released. Who do you think those Predators would vote for? </p>
