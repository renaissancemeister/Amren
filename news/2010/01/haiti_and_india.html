<h1>Haiti and India: Different Responses to Two Very Different Deadly Quakes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bobby Ghosh, Yahoo! News, January 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Almost exactly eight years ago, I was driving into another urban landscape flattened by a super-quake: the Kutch region of India&rsquo;s Gujarat state. Three densely-populated cities  &mdash;  Bhuj, Anjar and Bachau  &mdash;  had been turned into rubble, along with scores of villages. </p>
<p>I felt an overwhelming sense of deja-vu when I arrived in Port-au-Prince this week: the grim and grisly images of the mutilated and the dead, the heart-breaking tales of sundered families, the air thick with despair. And the utterly feeble efforts of an inept and corrupt government.</p>
<p>But not all the familiar images and emotions are terrible. As in Gujarat, I&rsquo;m also seeing the super-human effort of rescue teams, the amazing patience of aid workers and the iron fortitude of those who survived this catastrophe.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As much as quake zones look alike, though, the people caught in them respond to their tragedy in different ways. The Gujaratis, unused to natural disasters of the scale they confronted in 2001, were paralyzed by its enormity. Nearly a month after the first shock, many people, especially in the countryside, remained consumed by their fear.</p>
<p>Haitians, far too familiar with disaster, swiftly recovered their poise: barely a week after the the quake, food stalls had reopened in many neighborhoods. There was some looting, and here and there some violence. But that was mainly in Port-au-Prince. In towns like Leogane, where perhaps 9 out of 10 buildings have either collapsed or become uninhabitable, people have already dusted themselves off and are trying to work out their next step. It may have taken nearly a week to reach Leogane, but the town started to clear rubble sooner than the capital city. Even in Port-au-Prince, I saw people smiling, sometimes laughing aloud, kids playing basketball in the shadow of the destroyed Presidential palace, and soccer in the tent cities. There were few smiles in Gujarat eight years ago.</p>
<p>But if Haitians have been quicker to take their tragedy in stride, it&rsquo;s unlikely their country will recover as fast as Gujarat: within five years of the 2001 quake, large parts of Kutch had been rebuilt. Bhuj, Bachau and Anjar have rebounded. Nobody I&rsquo;ve met in Haiti expects Port-au-Prince or Leogane or Jacmel to recover in a decade, even two. Over and over I heard people say, with resignation, &#8220;Come back in five years, and you&rsquo;ll find that we haven&rsquo;t yet cleared the rubble.&#8221; Nobody said that to me in Gujarat.</p>
<p>Gujarat had several advantages over Haiti: it is one of India&rsquo;s most prosperous states, and its people have a well-deserved reputation for can-do entrepreneurship. Haiti, by contrast, is the sick man of Latin America and has little to show for private enterprise. Gujarat&rsquo;s government has much to be ashamed of (not least its appalling inability to protect its minority Muslim population), but it is largely business-friendly and very stable; Haiti&rsquo;s rulers are neither. It would take herculean optimism to imagine that they won&rsquo;t make a hash of rebuilding their wounded nation, just as they have done after every previous calamity.</p>

<p>Check it out. There&rsquo;s been several earthquakes in the past decade near part or greater than Haiti. A more precise casualty will not be known for some time. I suspect numbers are inflated to coax more foreign aid.</p>
<p>Shortly after Hurricane Katrina, I recall another water-related disaster, a tsunami in Indonesia or Malaysia. In each of those cases, people helped each other. </p>
<p>Foreign aid only quickened the pace of recovery but was not absolutely necessary as in this case. Foreign troops are needed to just keep the peace so that survivors don&rsquo;t kill each other. That just doesn&rsquo;t happen anywhere except in disaster zones with a lot of Blacks. Why only Africa and Black nations elsewehre that is perpetually in need of &#8220;Live Aid&#8221; fundraisers. It begs the question why Blacks and only Blacks are like that whereever they reside.</p>
<p>It also begs the question why so many in the West salivate over the opportunity to show off their philantrophy. It&rsquo;s as if they are trying to get their moment to show how willing they are to volunteer by their actual presence in Haiti, adopting, or boasting about how much money they donated.</p>

		<p>&#8220;India recovered much more quickly than Haiti will&#8221;.</p>
<p>I disagree with that. But then I can be a wild eyed optimist, at times. And a sucker for a good cause. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Haiti, by contrast, is the sick man of Latin America&#8221;</p>
<p>Haiti is not a part of Latin America? Latin America is generally defined as being the Spanish speaking part of the &#8220;new world&#8221;?</p>
<p>The Haitians are resilient in that they are already accustomed to living a low level of existence, so doing with less is not a big thing for them? This is true? But NOT a good sign. The average income in Haiti is only 1/10th that of the surrounding nations. What does that say?</p>

<p>Of course.  Who could expect them to actually be taking part in the rebuilding efforts, maybe by caring for the wounded?  Instead, they act predictably Black: sitting there laughing, shootin hoops, lootin stores, and waiting for Whitey to come clean up the mess.</p>

		<p>Of course racial explanations for the different responses to the two disasters are not permitted, but it seems to me it should be exactly the opposite. A people who are more emotionally disturbed by a disaster you would think would take longer to rebuild. </p>
<p>The explanation, of course, is that blacks tend not to take the initiative in anything. How hard have blacks worked to rebuild, say, Detroit? In the L.A. Times photo gallery posted a few days ago, we saw a picture of able-bodied Haitian males playing dominoes while the relief effort went on around them.</p>
<p> as far as the explanation being Haiti&rsquo;s poverty, why did Haiti become so poor in the first place and why has it remained so, despite massive amounts of foreign aid and training?</p>
<p><i>Over and over I heard people say, with resignation, &ldquo;Come back in five years, and you&rsquo;ll find that we haven&rsquo;t yet cleared the rubble.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>That says it all.</p>

		<p>Everything is solved. Haiti will have no international debt. Probably the only country in the entire world in that envious financial situation. Whoopee. They will be pleased&hellip; now they can borrow some more.<br>

		<p>Why is the writer getting his panties all wet because he thinks Gujarat state has an appalling inability to protect its minority Muslim population? India is for the Indians, not Muslims.</p>
<p>Does the writer ever ponder how well Pakistan protects its minority Indian population? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

		<p>The article seems like another attempt to talk up India and all indian. We on amren have become sick of this monumental hypocrisy coming from pro-india propagandists. Smells of some agenda. India with its 1+ billion population and gdp running in the trillions can easily cope with a disaster that claims few thousands.If the author cared to take into account variables on both sides of the equation, he would no doubt quickly realize that India as a whole is about as corrupt and dysfunctional as Haiti. </p>

		<p>  How about Italy&rsquo;s recovery from last year&rsquo;s earthquake? Did I forget the looting and mayhem? Admittedly, the loss of life and damage was much less, but I also don&rsquo;t recall anyone adopting Italian orphans, sending in US troops, charities raising money  on every street corner, media hand wringing, etc. etc.</p>

		<p>To Anonymous (re post # 9):</p>
<p>In the massacres you cited, the trouble was started by Muslims - they burned Hindus alive on that train. What Hindus did subsequently was justifiable retribution, in their minds.</p>
<p>Indeed, when India and Pakistan were partitioned in 1947, Hindus fleeing Pakistan for India were slaughtered by Muslims - without a single word of reproach from Gandhi. He would castigate Hindus for alleged mistreatment of Muslims and threaten to go on a death fast, but he was stone silent on Muslims killing Hindus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Nathuram Godse did what he did to Gandhi on January 30, 1948 at Birla House in New Delhi - he recognized over 60 years ago, that Muslims and Hindus living in &#8220;peaceful co-existence&#8221; was nothing more than one of Gandhi&rsquo;s Pollyanna pipe dreams. He feared for India&rsquo;s existence, especially in the face of Gandhi&rsquo;s sucking up to the Muslims.</p>
