<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=123191">Diversity&rsquo;s Double Standard</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Walter Williams, WorldNetDaily, January 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s not at all uncommon to watch a college basketball game and see that 90 to 100 percent of the players are black. According to the University of Central Florida&rsquo;s Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport report titled &#8220;The 2008 Racial and Gender Report Card,&#8221; the percentage of black male basketball players in Division I was an all-time high at 60.4 percent. It was 45.9 percent in football and 6.0 percent in baseball.</p>
<p>Diversity is worse in professional sports. In the National Basketball Association, almost 82 percent of the players are people of color, higher than last year&rsquo;s 80 percent. This is the highest percentage of players of color since the 1994-1995 season. The percentage of black players increased to 77 percent from last year&rsquo;s 76 percent mark. The percentage of Latinos remained constant at 3 percent. Football diversity is not much better. During the 2008 NFL season, the percentage of white players remained constant at 31 percent, while the percentage of black players increased slightly from 66 to 67 percent. {snip}</p>
<p>One can understand the absence of concern for diversity in professional sports; they are in it just for the money. But one is left flummoxed by the lack of sports diversity in college sports. After all, you can&rsquo;t listen to any college president or provost speak for more than five minutes before the word &#8220;diversity&#8221; drops from his lips. Colleges take diversity seriously, and they spend tens of millions of dollars on it. Juilliard School has a director of diversity and inclusion; MIT has a manager of diversity recruitment; Toledo University, an associate dean for diversity; Harvard, Texas A&M;, California at Berkeley, Virginia and many others boast of officers, deans, vice presidents and perhaps ministers of diversity. But, in what appears to be the height of deviousness and deceit, these diversity-driven administrators allow sports, the most visible part of the college, to be the least diverse and least inclusive.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at George Mason University, where I&rsquo;ve taught in its distinguished Economics Department for 29 years. According to university race/ethnic statistics, its campus consists of: 7 percent blacks, 7 percent Hispanics, 12 percent Asians, 43 percent white and miscellaneous others. If there were true basketball diversity, we would see at least two white players, and one each Asian, Hispanic and black on the starting five. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}American men are struck by lightning six times as often as American women. Men are about 54 percent of the labor force but suffer more than 90 percent of job-related deaths. Cervical cancer rates are five times higher among Vietnamese women in the U.S. than among white women. Pima Indians of Arizona have the highest diabetes rates in the world. Prostate cancer is nearly twice as common among black men as white men. Half of all Mexican wives are married in their teens, while only 10 percent of Japanese wives are married that early.</p>

		<p>This comes on the heels of the news about the white basketball league.  The way some supposedly conservative commentators like Matt Drudge and Bruce Jacobs are going on and on about this league, that it&rsquo;s somehow evil, one would think that they think that when ten white men are between the stripes on hardwood, the combination of friction between the shoes and the court, plus the evaporation of their sweat, combine to form an ethereal gas that dissipates in the air and is poisonous to people with only their first names.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, there has been really no criticism of this league from races of people that would be excluded.</p>

		<p>Yes I have seen much media attention about the lack of diversity in professional sports. However its usually a grievance about the lack of &ldquo;people of color&rdquo; in the management and coaching staff. Not a problem about a shortage of running backs in the NFL. Selective indeed!</p>

<p>These &#8220;conservatives&#8221; sound like another example of whites loudly bashing other whites as racist in order to impress minorities.</p>
<p>The minorities&rsquo; inevitable response: &#8220;You&rsquo;re right, those white guys are bigots. And so are you.&#8221; </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s why I pay no attention to professional sports&hellip;how can a white guy relate to a court or field full of black players? <br>
How many blacks watch hockey?</p>

		<p>Diversity is really just a code for ethnically cleansing Whites.</p>
<p>In professional football, where are the White running backs?  Where are the White corner backs?  </p>
<p>Ever since the local University has had 2 straight black quarterbacks my interest has plummeted.  I can&rsquo;t relate to these &#8216;brothas keepin&rsquo; it real yo&rsquo;.  </p>

		<p>To a great extent, much of the reason for this is how the rules have been changed to favor blacks. The shot clock, eliminating team play and intelligence, the adding of a step, since no blacks could keep from traveling, two steps still seems too few. That aside, blacks are mostly more genetically athletic. However the fact is few will ever graduate, with a degree in anything other than sports management, due to lower intelligence. Yet they are smart enough to manipulate the system to their advantage, with the aid of whites who hate all whites, except of course themselves. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s as if they don&rsquo;t know there are seperate historically black colleges and otheres that are defacto majority black colleges that are recruiting too. Reminds me of those in private industry doing all they can to recruit blacks especially, while government agencies employ a preponderance of blacks. 15 of 16 government agencies have a surplus of black employees with one agency being overrepesented by over 600%. </p>
