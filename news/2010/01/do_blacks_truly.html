<p>&#8220;He is post-racial, by all appearances,&#8221; the liberal host [Chris Matthews after President Barack Obama&rsquo;s State of the Union speech Wednesday] said on the air. &#8220;I forgot he was black tonight for an hour. You know, he&rsquo;s gone a long way to become a leader of this country, and past so much history, in just a year or two. I mean, it&rsquo;s something we don&rsquo;t even think about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthews meant it as praise, but it caused a rapid furor, with many calling the quote a troubling sign that blackness is viewed  &mdash;  perhaps unconsciously  &mdash;  as a handicap that still needs to be overcome.</p>
<p>Apparently, Matthews forgot to ask black people if they WANT to be de-raced.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a black American I want people to remember who I am and where I come from without attaching assumptions about deficiency to it,&#8221; said Dr. Imani Perry, a professor at Princeton&rsquo;s Center for African American Studies.</p>
<p>Although she thought Matthews was well-intentioned, she found his statement troubling, because &#8220;it suggests that if he had remembered Obama&rsquo;s blackness, that awareness would be a barrier to seeing him as a competent or able leader.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s important for us to remember that everyone has a race,&#8221; Blair L.M. Kelley, an associate professor of history at North Carolina State University. &#8220;When you say we&rsquo;re going to transcend race, are white people called on to transcend their whiteness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When (black people) transcend it, what do we become? Do we become white?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Why would we have to stop being our race in order to solve a problem?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;I thought I was saying something wonderful&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Matthews didn&rsquo;t get that far down the post-racial road on Wednesday night. But his comments instantly exploded online, especially on Twitter. Ninety minutes later, he clarified his comments on the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m very proud I did it and I hope I said it the right way,&#8221; Matthews said, noting that he grew up in the racially fraught 1960s.</p>
<p>&#8220;I walked into the room tonight, you could feel (racial tension) wasn&rsquo;t there tonight and that takes leadership on his part, to get us beyond those divisions, really national leadership,&#8221; Matthews said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt it wonderfully tonight, almost like an epiphany. I think he&rsquo;s done something wonderful. I think he&rsquo;s taken us beyond black and white in our politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Thursday, Matthews told the Grio that he has no regrets over making the remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I was saying something wonderful and positive about America.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But for many blacks, it was hard to forget the word &#8220;forgot.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Judged on merits, not race</b></p>
<p>Kevin Jackson, a black conservative and author of &#8220;The BIG Black Lie,&#8221; hews to the same philosophy as the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck  &mdash;  that people should be judged on their merits, not their color.</p>
<p>Yet Jackson does not want his blackness to be forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely not,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because we have an amazing history.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She [Sophia Nelson, a black attorney, former lobbyist and founder of PoliticalIntersection.com,] said Matthews&rsquo; comment showed the same unconscious bias as those by Vice President Joe Biden when he was still a senator that Obama was &#8220;clean&#8221; and &#8220;articulate,&#8221; and Sen. Harry Reid&rsquo;s saying that Obama was more electable because he was light-skinned and lacking a &#8220;Negro dialect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Matthews was saying exactly what he meant,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;He forgot he was black because he&rsquo;s so articulate and so compelling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another common interpretation of Matthews&rsquo; comment was that if he forgot Obama was black during his speech, it must be part of his thinking the other 23 hours of the day.</p>

		<p>Maybe Chris Matthews was right, but in the wrong way.  I don&rsquo;t know if any of you noticed this, but it seems to me they did everything they can to make President Obama&rsquo;s face look as light as possible.  I think it was a combination of skin cream and creative lighting, and perhaps some tinkering with the cameras.</p>

<p><br>
You don&rsquo;t have to stop being your race because that is not even possible, you just have to start acting intelligently and unfortunately for many blacks due to their low IQ that is not possible.<br>
 <br>
It&rsquo;s quite obvious what Chris Matthews meant. Obama transcends race because he is clearly intelligent and whether you agree with his liberal political ideology or not, his behavior is anything but typical black behavior.</p>

<p>No, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter, because the differences will never be transcended no matter what is tried or how many lies are told.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re headed for some hard times that will make that very plain to see, even for the lefties.</p>

		<p>I believe that the last thing American Blacks would want to do, actually, would be to &#8220;transcend race&#8221;. Because if they did so, they would have to compete with others without affirmative action&hellip; and go back down to their natural level, in society&hellip;<br>
No more wringing their hands, talking about past injustices, slavery, segregation and so on.</p>

		<p>No they don&rsquo;t. They don&rsquo;t want to leave their very comfortable, non-challenging victim status, because then they would have to face their own miserable failure to succeed because of laziness, playing the victim card, and an attitude that makes fun of achievers.</p>

<p>How laughable, Comrade Matthews (aka, The Tingler) was simply in a multicultural euphoria, akin to what Muslim terrorists must feel before they &ldquo;martyr&rdquo; themselves in an act of frenzied Jihad. Clearly by his statements, he was in a near orgasmic rapture of racial nebulousness himself, brought into witnessing his mulatto &ldquo;messiah&rsquo;s&rdquo; little dog and pony show of Communism. </p>
<p>Gosh, that must have been particularly liberating for him, having his &ldquo;white guilt&rdquo; washed away in this baptism of diversity.</p>

		<p>Why does anyone want to transcend race or ethnicity?  Is there anything wrong with being French or Russian or Japanese?  Is there anything wrong with the shear fact that races, ethnic groups, and cultures are different?  For you diversity worshipers, diversity is impossible if everyone is the same.  But of course, in marxist newspeak, diversity means absolute conformity, one of the goals of the marxist hegemon.</p>
<p>The answer to the transcendence question is as obvious as it is simple.  The &#8220;transcendence of race&#8221; is the pretense that certain races and cultures are not simply failures.</p>

		<p>Didn&rsquo;t MLK say he wanted to be &#8220;judged by the content of his character, not the color of his skin?&#8221; The implications of that are obvious. Color should become irrelevant. But now these blacks are saying they absolutely want their color to be noticed. Even Matthews, who&rsquo;s about as liberal as they come (in other words, a typical member of the MSM) has offended them. It just goes to show that you can&rsquo;t please these people.</p>

		<p>I think these comment&rsquo;s by Matthews, Reid, Biden, and the Clinton&rsquo;s are harmless and laughable and are not worthy of an apology. That said however it is pure Schadenfreude to watch these creeps squirm and grovel. It is such poetic justice that they might be consumed by the monster (PC) that they have had such a hand in creating and sustaining. It almost remind one of Frankenstein.</p>

		<p>Transcend race?  Perish the thought!</p>
<p>Being black is not a condition for many black Africans.  It&rsquo;s a full-time occupation, a profession from which they realize great benefits and rewards.</p>
<p>To transcend race would be to render many of them unemployed, adrift in an indifferent world.</p>

		<p>Behold Chris Matthews - this is the purest living example of half a century(and them some)of white brainwashing and conditioning. Many mouth the words, many pretend to have all the &#8220;right&#8221; opinions on these matters, many simply lie and say what they believe the &#8220;accpeted&#8221; thing to say is - but relatively few have bought the whole twisted egalitarian mythology the way the Chris Matthews&rsquo; of the world have. He is a True Believer down into his marrow! </p>
<p>His racial self-loathing is palpable, his deification of non-whites, and Obama in particular as his titular Messiah, is perfectly devout. The man is an acolyte of the first order. </p>
<p>His Masters must be so proud!</p>

		<p>There is much inter-black discrimination among blacks that relates to skin color (or the lack of it).  Light-skinned blacks can be accused of &#8220;passing for white&#8221; and are frequently ostracized by their darker &#8220;cousins&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Obama is far from highly intelligent. He is so into himself that had his college scores been high they would not be hidden from view. He is a clown put in office by some powerful Chicago style democrats.</p>
<p>Chris Matthews is another clown. He doesn&rsquo;t know what it is to live among blacks regardless of the times he grew up in. He is a stooge for the democrats. That&rsquo;s why MSNBC ratings are so low. Let him go visit Uniontown Alabama for a week. When he sees how people can turn a country like America into a third world country I wonder if it would open his eyes. </p>
<p>Most liberals wouldn&rsquo;t admit the trouble black society is no matter what they see. It&rsquo;s like they have some kind of stockholm syndrome whenever they encounter hostile members of another race. </p>

		<p>One reason for any perceived trancendance of race, might be because the American public is constantly bombarded by black faces, black dominated entertainment, black dominated sports (notice how few ads there are for the Winter Olympics and when they air, it most often features the mixed-race Apollo Ono?).  Pop culture has become so inundated with forced black presences that ALL Americans, at least most whites now reflexively see black as normal.  Our enitre society is now inundated with whites who are frankly neurotic in their anti-white, pro-black activites.  Everyone has seen the weepy whites who appear on another shill for sponsoring non-white children in third world countries.  These spokespeople appear completely neurotic to me. Many whites, likely the majority suffer from a kind of self-denying blindness.  When they look in the mirror, they don&rsquo;t see a white face, just as a bulimic woman continues to see an obese version of herself no matter how dangerously thin she has become.</p>
<p>Much of this is due to the media.  It is amazing to note the ever increasing casting and camera tricks used to demonstrate our eclipse through racial image manipulations.  Camera/lighting, and (perhaps CGI)are often used when whites are used to darken their skin, make them look less white.  The psychological effect on whites is clearly aimed at making us feel like a minority, an evil minority, that finds solace when it begins to act, feel, and find joy in gravitating toward a non-white self-perception.  I have no doubt that these so-called post-racial types in the industry sit around a planning board and intentionally set up the most racially provocative situations they can, while obstensively daring the viewer to articulate what their eyes and mind tells them.  The viewer risks the label of &#8220;racist&#8221; even in their own internal dialogues.  This is how white America has been and is being brainwashed.</p>

		<p>So, it is now politically incorrect to be politically correct? We have reached the zenith of the liberal multicult crusade, the point where even towing the PC-line by whites is now Not-PC.  Oh the angst and turmoil that guilty white liberals must feel at this  directive from the blacks-that-know-better   &mdash;   what are they to do?  For race hustlers, this sort of mind-bending argument   &mdash;   one that imputes false consciousness and &#8220;subliminal&#8221; racism to even whites who strictly adhere to the PC play-book   &mdash;   is the trump card in a long line of tricks and gambits.  Even whites&rsquo; &#8220;good&#8221; intentions shows latent racism, and every white must therefore ritualistically cleanse their sin (in higher taxes, affirmative action, welfare, food stamps, and utter self-deprecation) at the alter of diversity.  </p>

		<p>I think anybody who bases their identity on their race is pathetic.  Those who do this are bound to stay there, and reap whatever results that inevitably come from such a decision.  To base one&rsquo;s identity on something higher than race (a child of God, a servant of the Lord, or even a great parking meter attendant) - requires a depth of character that the race folks don&rsquo;t seem to possess.  And that applies to people of ALL races, BTW.  Point being, if you truly want to succeed in this world and in the hereafter, you better have something beyond race to base your identity on.  If you don&rsquo;t, good luck.</p>

		<p>I always see being black as a handicap unless we&rsquo;re talking about sports where there is a definite &#8216;disparity of impact&rsquo; unless the sport is swimming.  Blacks make about as good a scientist as they do swimmers.  That&rsquo;s just the thing. Race always signifies a difference, and it always will.  Treat everybody equal of course, but please no affirmative action, welfare, or other destructive liberal policies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately blacks are not as intelligent as whites, and this is the reason they will always hate us as do the non-European Mexicans.  This is why the continued trend in this country towards ethnically cleansing whites into minority status will lead to our ultimate demise and the demise of our once great nation.</p>

<p>Exactly. So as a white man I too have a perspective because of my race. It is not only &#8216;people of color&rsquo; who can have a view or concern that relates to it. Whites also have a culture and ethnicity that is worth preserving. Time we all start acting like it. </p>

		<p>Race is blacks&rsquo; ticket into the affirmative action voting block, the <i>real majority</i> from which many economic and employment advantages accrue.</p>
<p>Women along make up 50% of the population, which is not a minority, plus when you add in racial minorities into affirmative action voting block, it breaks down to about ..</p>
<p>White males 25%<br>
affirmative action voting block 75%</p>
<p>That is a three to one voting advantage.  And it breaks down about the same for purchasing power.</p>
<p>So the real political power, in purchasing and voting, is with minorities by a huge extent.  </p>
<p>That is a huge tyranny of the majority and white males have little opportunity to achieve equal rights.</p>

		<p>Transcend race?  How laughable.  Black males nearly to a man are doing everything in their power to transform not transcend race  by copulating with white females. Blacks, and perhaps rightfully so, look at everything through the eyes of genetic determinism. Progressivism and abject stupidity on the part of so many whites has afforded blacks the freedom to improve their genetic lot through interbreeding.</p>

Kind of hard to do that when blacks recieve entitlements from the government at the expense of the white taxpayers held hostage to a people that use skin color as an excuse to not build character.</p>

<p>CM: &#8220;We are all the same now, praise be to Obama!&#8221;.<br>

<i>&ldquo;When you say we&rsquo;re going to transcend race, are white people called on to transcend their whiteness?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><br>
No, white people are being called on to <i>commit mass suicide</i> so that the dark shall inherit the earth. </p>
<p>What I suspect most blacks (including Obama) would like more than anything else   &mdash;   their &#8220;best-case scenario&#8221;   &mdash;   is for whites simply to disappear. For white reproduction rates to continue dwindling to the point where that blacks can simply take over all the nice white countries and all the neato stuff whites have created over the centuries. </p>
<p>Then, lacking any white opposition or resistance, nonwhites will be free to rename these countries and rewrite history so that all of the human race&rsquo;s advances were accomplished by nonwhites, all wars were won by nonwhites, and all technology was invented by nonwhites. Then, finally, they&rsquo;ll have their Casper-free paradise right here on earth.</p>
<p>You know: just like Haiti. Only way bigger. </p>

		<p>This just shows that even when you try to pay them a complement, you can still stick your foot in your mouth. Can&rsquo;t win!  Serves Matthews right, pandering to them the way he does. </p>
<p>If we said that we want it always remembered that we are white, that would be considered racist and arrogant. But it&rsquo;s OK for them.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do, regarding blacks, is to say NOTHING. Avoid them and the whole subject completely.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Chris Matthews &hellip; doesn&rsquo;t know what it is to live among blacks regardless of the times he grew up in. He is a stooge for the democrats. Let him go visit Uniontown Alabama for a week. When he sees how people can turn a country like America into a third world country I wonder if it would open his eyes.&#8221;    &mdash;    Douglas<br>

<p>I knew nothing about Uniontown, Alabama.  So I had to look it up.</p>
<p>Very interesting.  Uniontown&rsquo;s population is over 88% black.     40% of households had a female householder with no husband present.  For every 100 females over 18  yrs., there were 60 males.  Median income for a household was $12,386.  Per capita income  was $8,268.  There were  48% of families  below the poverty line, including 60% of those under age 18.</p>
<p>However&hellip;&#8221;Uniontown is known for their 11 state high school basketball championships. It is also home to the underground rapper, Hakeem Brown.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s nice.  At least they have something to be proud of!  <br>
Sounds to me like a bit of Haiti in the USA.</p>

<p>And let&rsquo;s not forget that he owes ust about every good thing in his life to affirmative action and other such things&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, he went to Harvard through affirmative action. Then, at Harvard, he was noticed by some liberals who made him editor of the Harvard law review (while Barack O. was still a first-year law student).</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s very possible that he got big breaks in the working place because of his skin color too&hellip;</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like Barack got to where he is because of talent, and honest hard work; he is more like&hellip; an affirmative action mulatto prince!</p>

		<p>35 François:</p>
<p>The history behind Barack Obama becoming editor of the Harvard Law Review is even more sordid.  He actually got most of the votes of the relatively few conservative HLS students, because they thought of him as a more acceptable moderate compared to several bigmouth loudmouth liberals, who were splitting the liberal vote.  Obama was able to piece together almost all the conservatives and some liberals who didn&rsquo;t like the more viable liberal candidates to win.  So it was worse than affirmative action, it was affirmative action on the part of conservatives supposedly opposed to it. </p>
