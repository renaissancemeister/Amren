			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andy Clayton, New York Daily News, January 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Paul Shirley, whose brief NBA career included 18 games and 33 points with three teams over three seasons, is not in the giving mood. {snip}</p>
<p>Shirley writes on flipcollective.com why he won&rsquo;t be joining the millions from around the globe sending money to support the Haitian relief efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&rsquo;t donated a cent to the Haitian relief effort. And I probably will not.</p>
<p>&#8220;{snip} If I use history as my guide, I don&rsquo;t think the people of Haiti will do much with my money either.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He continued: &#8220;Shouldn&rsquo;t there be some discourse on how the millions of dollars that are being poured into Haiti will be spent? And at least a slight reprimand for the conditions prior to the earthquake? Some kind of inquisition? Something like this?:<blockquote>Dear Haitians  &mdash;  </p>
<p>First of all, kudos on developing the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Your commitment to human rights, infrastructure, and birth control should be applauded.</p>
<p>As we prepare to assist you in this difficult time, a polite request: If it&rsquo;s possible, could you not re-build your island home in the image of its predecessor? Could you not resort to the creation of flimsy shanty- and shack-towns? And could some of you maybe use a condom once in a while?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Rest of the World<br>
</blockquote>The essay, posted on the FlipCollective Web site on Tuesday, has already cost Shirley one job.</p>
<p>Shirley was fired from his freelance gig with ESPN on Wednesday.</p>

		<p>Well, the man hsd to be admired for speaking his mind and surely he is allowed to under the US Constitution.  Haiti has had the sad reputation of being just what Mr Shirley stated and has relied on large foreign handouts for many decades so advice such as Mr Shirley&rsquo;s should be well considered for the sake of the future in Haiti.  Surely after 200 years of self-rule, Haiti should be self-sufficient by now?</p>

		<p>His comments needed to be stated in a more intellectual fashion.  He&rsquo;s got the right idea.  Haiti is a tropical paradise - or it should be.  It has some of the most arable land in the world.  When it was run by the French it was thriving.  It&rsquo;s sad but true; Blacks lack civilization building skills - and now we are pouring our tax dollars into their failed country.  In addition to that the events in Haiti, will most likely lead to an open-door policy that will result in hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of Haitians coming to our shores and taking their same lack of civilization building skills to make our country a little more like theirs.  It&rsquo;s time to wake-up.</p>

<p>Concise and true.</p>
<p>I was watching a speech given by the Haiti ambassador on c-span. He blamed whites and Europeans for Haitis&rsquo; troubled history. But he added, he was sure that with the help of western nations, this time, Haiti would flourish.</p>
<p>I believe Paul Shirley knows Haitian history better than the Haitian ambassador.</p>

<p>That link basically gives the real reason no on should give a single cent to Haiti.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a report on just how much money the US has given them.  During the 90&rsquo;s, we gave them roughly $266,000 per person.  The average family size in Haiti is 7.  That comes out to a $186,200 a year income per year, for 10 years (note this does not count all the aid sent to Haiti since then), per family.</p>
<p>This is plenty of money for the average Haitian to own their own house, a couple of cars and live an opulent existence in any 1st world nation.  In a third world nation like Haiti, it equates to being set for life&hellip;&hellip;every Haitian&hellip;.set for life.</p>
<p>Yet, the average Haitian lives a desperate, squalid existence, where their prime recreational activities are doing drugs and killing each other.</p>
<p>Where did all that money go?  Either it was all squandered or stolen (a lot of both I imagine).</p>
<p>But one point is perfectly crystal clear, no amount of money can change a thing in Haiti.  The US could send our entire gross national product over there and the city will still remain in rubble.  Whites would rebuild the city for them (which they would quickly destroy again) but it&rsquo;s impossible (without killing a whole bunch of Haitians) because large numbers of &#8220;youths&#8221; are currently rampaging through the city, killing anything that moves with machetes and machine guns.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about lack of money, lack of resources, lack of help from other countries.  This is about the character of the people who live in Haiti.</p>
<p>Haiti&rsquo;s fate was sealed the day they decided to commit the crime of genocide, using an impaled baby (an impaled WHITE baby) on the end of a pike as their standard.  That&rsquo;s the type of people the Haitians are and that type of person creates the exact situation that is there now&hellip;..the earthquake had NOTHING to do with it.</p>

		<p>Interesting how an American can now be fired simply for making personal (and clearly true) observations about a totally failed foreign state.</p>
<p>Of course, had Haiti been inhabited by impoverished whites, with two hundred years of social, cultural, and political failure, his comments likely would have been unnoticed, or perhaps with some commentators noting that they were just getting their just deserts.  </p>

		<p>Kudos to this guy for speaking his mind and the truth! I too plan on donating not one cent to the Haiti relief effort. Not that I&rsquo;m a hard-hearted man, but rather because I know that the money will be squandered, and also because I know that it will probably be used to bring more Haitians into the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>Remember how we used to mock the communist Soviet Union for the way it treated dissidents who dared to speak their minds and question the prevailing wisdom? Well, are we really any better in present-day North America? This guy got fired from his job for speaking common sense. No other network will pick him up. And all because he doesn&rsquo;t believe in multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Human rights crusaders and commissions are the North American equivalent of Siberian labor camps under Stalin.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s funny, but the opinion columnist for my local newspaper has questioned why we should send money to Haiti, albeit with carefully chosen words, and he has gotten a lot of hate mail for doing so. </p>
<p>On the other hand, a lot of readers supported him. They also wanted to know if Haitians would be brought to Indiana, if U.S. taxpayer money would be spent to bring them here, or if Hoosiers would be expected to adopt them. (The answer, he said, is no, no and no.)</p>
<p>The funny thing is, my impression of this columnist was that he used to be very politically correct, but he seems to be wising up in recent years.</p>
<p>I do believe that, despite the election of Obama, the American public is wising up as well, albeit slowly,.</p>

		<p>When it comes to foreign aid I think what we fail to realize is, that money has to pass through so many hands that the people on the bottom never see one nickel of that money. I&rsquo;d bet that most of it never leaves the hands of the people entrusted with doling it out. It always looks good on paper, but that&rsquo;s as far as it goes. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, we will always see a couple of truck loads of rice and starving women and children with their hands out and this visual is enough to satisfy the taxpayers that something good is being done with their money, but that&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s one good photo shoot and now off to the next disaster ($$$$).</p>
<p>As far as Paul Shirly goes I think his observations are spot on. If food is delivered to these people, after this emergency is over, they will continue to fornicate themselves into the grave. Food is the same as Viagra to these folks and they won&rsquo;t stop copulating even if they were smart enough to realize they are one orgasm away from oblivion. There is only so much food and sooo many mouths to feed.  The world is fast approaching the point where only the productive nations will be fed and places like Haiti will cease to exist. <br>

<p>Another &#8220;independent&#8221; African republic with over 200 years in which to have developed some semblance of civilisation is Liberia. The slaves of Hispanola &amp; America wanted freedom &amp; they got it.  They both started at the bottom and worked their way down.</p>

<p>The Haitians, having endured a tremendous disaster, will be in a survival mood, which means: Have more babies.</p>
<p>We, by feeding them, are only encouraging this.</p>
<p>Just wait &hellip; nine months from now, near next Halloween, Haiti will have a baby boom.</p>

		<p>Once all the obligatory White guilt is assuaged by this initial burst of semi-spontaneous charity, folks will basically forget all about Haiti, as per the usual. What they will not realize, however, is that they are now basically &#8220;on the hook&#8221; forever, and will be pouring still more money and various resources into that pesthole for decades as a result of this quake - not that we weren&rsquo;t already, but now the flodgates are flung wide open.  </p>

		<p>Everything I have read attributed to Mr Shirley is true; it&rsquo;s a shame we can&rsquo;t be truthful in our country, but when you&rsquo;re living a lie truth is a revolutionary concept.</p>
<p>Blacks are always the victims, just like our first victim and his first victim wife; nothing is ever their fault.  Blame whitey and blame the Westerners.  What a shame to be such dolts on the face of this earth.  Even more shameful is our leadership buying this diversity and false doctrine&hellip;.</p>

<p>  Perhaps, Mr. Shirley is being a little insensitive, considering the magnitude of Haitian tragedy, and yet I feel that his questions and concerns should be addressed. Why has Haiti remained the basket case of the Western Hemisphere after untold billions in foreign aid and an occupation by the United States from 1915 to 1934? Will a rebuilt Haiti be any more stable or economically viable than before? These are questions that our controlled media and multicultural liberals are reluctant to consider and punish the lonely truth-seeker, Shirley, who impudently asks them.</p>

		<p>I would like to know if there are examples of societies composed of subsaharan genetics that can maintain themselves without hand outs from white people. I&rsquo;m not talking ..subsistance levels..and I don&rsquo;t mean in calamity, I mean under normal circumstances with a modern infrastructure. Some clarity is necessary to form honest opinion. I don&rsquo;t know the setting of the rather insensitive words of Shirly&hellip;but how many of us have used insensitive words&hellip; when we run ot of patience..? At least Shirly had the courage to state a truth when he well knew it would not be popular. One thing is quite probable&hellip;If the blacks hadn&rsquo;t massacred the white ruling class back in the early 1800 period, Haiti would have remained a prosperous beautiful environment without all the self inflicted chaos. Again&hellip;Clarity&hellip;is what is needed to form honest opinion,&hellip;once emotion fests infest the equation&hellip;clear sight and clear solutions become obscured.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of the late, great Sam Kinison and his take on helping starving Ethiopians back in the 80&rsquo;s.It went something like this: whatever you do, don&rsquo;t send them food. If you have to send them something, send them luggage. Send them U-Hauls. Send them me,I&rsquo;ll go talk to them.I&rsquo;ll say, you know, we just drove hundreds of miles through the desert to bring you food, and it occurred to me on the way that maybe you people wouldn&rsquo;t be starving if you lived where the food is! You live in a f  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   desert! See this? It&rsquo;s sand. You know what its going to be in ten years? Its still going to be sand! Nothing grows in sand! And on he went. This was at the height of sanctimonious hand-wringing over world hunger, We Are the World, Do They Know its Christmas, etc. And 25 years later, the population of Ethiopia has doubled. And they&rsquo;re still starving.</p>

<p>When people ask why I&rsquo;m not donating money, that&rsquo;s the reason I give.  They&rsquo;re usually shocked(not to mention most people have no idea that the reason Haiti has no whites because Haitians killed all of them).</p>

		<p>Is it possible for us to contact Mr. Shirley and show our support? He is being made to feel guilty by the usual suspects for speaking the truth, it is important that we let him know he is not alone is having those views, and he should not bow to people who have ulterior agendas.</p>

		<p>Mr. Shirley&rsquo;s comment is succinct, eloquent in its simplicity and beyond refute.</p>
<p>It is the height of racism to believe that backwards, low IQ&rsquo;d, violent blacks whose true home is the veldt and brush of Africa, will ever be able to morph themselves into a people who are industrious, have an Anglo-Saxon work ethic and are highly intelligent with keen foresight to make sure the same thing doesn&rsquo;t happen again.  </p>
<p>Haitians have been repeatedly given copious amounts of US taxpayer money which their leaders have repeatedly squandered.  Haiti is what it is because of the population that lives there and it is not the job of American taxpayers to welcome them into our homelands or take care of them because they have over-bred, despoiled their own land and are incapable of feeding or taking care of themselves.  There is no reason to admit anyone who will live off of US welfare in perpetuity  &mdash;  especially those who are infected with AIDS.  </p>
<p>I resent that even one penny of my money is being used to sustain and even increase this population while my own is being marginalized, robbed and replaced by non-Whites.  Whites in South Africa are being freely murdered by blacks yet there is no outrage anywhere in the West or call to rescue them and admit them under refugee status into our homelands.  Instead, my tax money is used to admit Somalis, Haitians and other denizens of the Fourth World who are settled into White communities.  Complaining about any of this constitutes charges of racism and Hate Speech.</p>
<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for outside aid, particularly from US taxpayers, Mother Nature would have long ago balanced the Haitian population through starvation and disease  &mdash;  although I doubt Haitians would be capable of making that connection and instead blame the Whites that they hacked apart 200 years ago.</p>
<p>The altruistic course of action would be to let the Haitians take care of themselves and re-build Haiti in their image using their own resources.  ANY aid coming from beleaguered US taxpayers should used to curtail population growth via mandatory IUD insertion in every single female between the ages of 10 and 50.  That is humane; feeding them and allowing an expansion of their population is not.</p>
<p>Here is a wonderful, non-statist article entitled &#8220;Haiti Must Not Be Rebuilt&#8221;: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I do mind when a Western government, such as that of Barack Obama in the United States, seeks to commit its taxpayers&rsquo; money to a programme of reconstruction in that part of the world&hellip;.reconstructing Haiti would simply repeat the mistakes of the past, which have shown, conclusively and supported by examples elsewhere, that any effort to encourage a former colony now run by Black Africans to become a Western-style society, complete with rule of law, a thriving market economy, property rights, industrial production, modern communications, and the like, is futile and counterproductive. Haiti must not be re-built&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Agreed.  Any Questions?</p>

		<p>Unfortunately Mr. Shirley has already given copiously to Haiti; he was compelled to do so via his tax witholdings under penalty of a Federal prison sentence for income tax evasion.</p>
<p>I hope to live to see a different group of people running the United States someday: a group that will not play &#8220;Global Santa Claus&#8221; with our money.</p>
