			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John McWhorter, The New Republic, January 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The figures from the American Community Survey just in are more than crunched numbers. They suggest that this might be a good year for a certain term now familiar in American parlance to be, if not consigned to history, reassigned.</p>
<p>Namely, as of now, almost 1 in 10 black people are foreign-born. About 1 in 30 are from Africa. Which means that they are  &mdash;  you see where I&rsquo;m going  &mdash;  African American in the true sense. Certainly a truer sense  &mdash;  true as in making sense  &mdash;  than Tracy Morgan, Donna Brazile, Jesse Jackson, or Mo&rsquo;Nique.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year the number of Africans here topped a million, and we could use that as a numerically convenient time to let go of the conceit we have gotten used to over the past twenty years, that black people born here are ethnically hyphenated people of half &#8220;African&#8221; ancestry.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t go through. The black American does not look back on a childhood in the African &#8220;old country.&#8221; The black American speaks English natively, not Twi or Hausa (and in truth, it&rsquo;s possible that not a single slave brought to the United States spoke Swahili). Barely a black American alive today knows anyone who ever even knew a slave born in Africa.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be one thing if it were a hundred years ago and lots of black people still had parents who had been born into slavery and grandparents who actually &#8220;spoke African,&#8221; as it was sometimes put. But this is a very different time.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And I would argue that native-born blacks are so vastly less &#8220;African&#8221; than actual Africans that calling ourselves &#8220;African American&#8221; is not only illogical but almost disrespectful to African immigrants. Here are people who were born in Africa, speak African languages, eat African food, dance in African ways, remember African stories, and will spiritually always be a part of Africa  &mdash;  and we stand up and insist that we, too, are &#8220;African&#8221; because Jesse Jackson said so?</p>
<p>After all, most of us don&rsquo;t feel meaningfully &#8220;African&#8221; in the least. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For example, how &#8220;African&#8221; is, say, Oprah compared to a Caribbean American? We have heard much this week, for example, about the fundamentally African substrate of Haitian culture, and the truth and meaning in that is clear from even a superficial familiarity with that nation. Many of the slaves first brought to Haiti spoke a language of Togo and Benin called Fongbe, in which you put the articles after nouns: the table is wema o &#8220;table the.&#8221; In Haitian Creole, the words are from French but the syntax is a lot like Fongbe: the table is tab-la. Haitian Creole is one part French and one part African. For real. And it sounds like it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But still, why can&rsquo;t we all be &#8220;African American&#8221; anyway? What has always worried me about it is an issue of pride. The notion that we do ourselves a favor by pretending that we are part &#8220;African&#8221; after four hundred years of cultural development right here in America implies that what we have done here isn&rsquo;t inspiring enough. Among black Americans in 2010, true black pride does not call itself &#8220;African.&#8221;</p>
<p>I, for example, don&rsquo;t know where my African ancestors came from, and quite honestly I&rsquo;m not on my way to turning in a cheek swab to find out anytime soon. It was too long ago  &mdash;  if my genes trace back to, say, Ghana with a bit of Nigeria mixed in, it would have nothing to do with the first John Hamilton McWhorter, who was born a slave near Atlanta. I, for the record, am the fifth John Hamilton McWhorter, the tail end of a story that began in Atlanta, migrated to Philadelphia, and is now living on in New York. An American story.</p>
<p>My openly bisexual saxophone playing great-grandmother didn&rsquo;t know from Benin. My great-aunt who was still running up the steps of the now-defunct North Philadelphia train station in her nineties did not speak Yoruba (and in fact spoke a solid, crisp &#8220;Negro dialect&#8221; I recall fondly). My grandfather didn&rsquo;t set up his printing shop in Lagos. My parents made my life possible far, far from Angola. I am not &#8220;African American&#8221;  &mdash;  I am black American.</p>
<p>Yeah, black will have to do. {snip} And let&rsquo;s not even get into incidents where white people born and raised in Africa get into trouble for calling themselves African American when they move here  &mdash;  cases like an especially disturbing case from last summer (a white Mozambiquean was assaulted for calling himself African American).</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s supposed to just understand!&#8221; some think  &mdash;  but how well do any of us, white or black, understand the usage of African American under current circumstances? Is there, really, anything to be understood?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t used &#8220;African American&#8221; in print since 2004 except in ironic quotes or to refer to the term itself. I urge other writers to consider joining me.<br>

		<p>In my own experience blacks only like to be called &#8220;African American&#8221; in the presence of non-blacks - indeed they practically DEMAND it! They almost never refer to themselves this way in strictly black company however, as I have been informed many times. It&rsquo;s just another matter of black symbolism; another way to say, &#8220;THIS is what you must call us Whitey!,&#8221; when in fact, they have historically never like the title anyway. </p>
<p>If I recall correctly, Jared Taylor covered some of this in his book, &#8220;Paved With Good Intentions.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As long as whites weren&rsquo;t making any noise, the blacks and other races were assertively flaunting their &#8216;different-ness&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The more white nationalism comes out into the open, the more the other races start downplaying their race.</p>
<p>Afraid of being shut out by a new resurgent white identity, their new accomodation will be, &#8220;we&rsquo;re all Americans, brother&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The term &#8220;African American&#8221; came into being because Jesse Jackson, whose name the MSM always pronounces in reverential tones, decreed that it must be so! *</p>

Henry Louis Gates JR proposed that blacks should refer to themselves as &#8216;neo-Nubians&rsquo; as an act of pride when, for 100 years, Nubians ruled Egypt.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what they call themselves today because in 20 years they&rsquo;ll re-brand themselves again.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never used the term African American, it just sounds too stupid rolling off my tongue, and prefer the term black when referring to the melanin enhanced among us.  I personally would prefer blacks keep calling themselves African American because it has a psuedo American connotation to it while I prefer us Whites calling ourselves just Americans meaning the true Americans.  </p>

		<p>African-American history? Black history? Call it what you will. The &#8220;history&#8221; stories are contrived feel-good tales from the Liberal egalitarians and the neo-Con leeches.</p>
<p>Regardless of their falsehoods, reality and truth remain!</p>
<p>Without White people, Blacks would not have any access to food, clothing, shelter, television, movies, radio, central air conditioning or heating, indoor plumbing, a written language, commerce, education, transportation, or freedom! None. Nada. Zilch. Zip. Pretending and outright lying will never change those facts, my friends.</p>
<p>What have Blacks given to Whites in return? A dominanting sub-culture of undesirables, violent crime, a wide array of sexual diseases, utter dependancy on Whites for nearly everything, rampant illegitimacy, and a panorama of social chaos. </p>
<p>To be sure, the White power-elite destroyed America financially and on purpose, but the instrument of their chosing was African-Americans, who function as a needy lot of near total dead-weight thrust upon western civilization.<br>

Exactly!  As soon as the latest title becomes besmirched with reality, they will have to look around and find some yet un-tarnished term as substitute. Then, re-play from the beginning all over again.</p>

		<p>The point is that blacks don&rsquo;t qualify as Americans. People are born Polish or Chinese, etc. but you become an American. That is what blacks have never been capable of, becoming American.</p>
<p>Americanism is a standard. Blacks don&rsquo;t measure up. Plain and simple. In the end of course, they&rsquo;ll finally go absolutely stark raving mad under the strain of not fitting in, no matter all the efforts to create the illusion they do. Once that happens, of course, they&rsquo;ll have to be dealt with forcefully. But that is the way things will have to be done unfortuneately. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not our fault (White Nationalists - actually we&rsquo;re the best friends blacks have, at least, we&rsquo;re not lying to them). It&rsquo;s the liberals who&rsquo;ve tried to create something that just isn&rsquo;t factual (black intellectual, emotional, and physical ability).</p>

<p>For  consistency&rsquo;s sake the  next  East Asian  phenotype you  encounter at  work or  anywhere  &mdash;  would  you  address him/her  as &#8220;yellow&#8221;?  After  all,  the  term  &#8220;yellow&#8221; to  refer  to  East  Asians is  already  in use as  in &#8220;yellow  peril&#8221;,  and  more  quietly  &#8220;yellow bastard&#8221;.   Or  how  about  &#8220;brown American&#8221; or  just  &#8220;browns&#8221; as in the  &#8220;the  browns are crossing  the  Southern border at  will&#8221;.  </p>
<p>And  by  the way,  you are  not  &#8220;white&#8221; at  all  &mdash;  but  more like  &#8220;pink&#8221;.  So  again, for accuracy&rsquo;s  sake  how  about  dropping  &#8220;white&#8221; and  using &#8220;pink&#8221; instead?</p>

<p>&hellip;melanin enhanced,&hellip; almost sounds like a PC term to downplay the myriad of actual differences between the races.  There are many more differences, genetic differences than simply melanin. I am not going to list them here, as they are too numerous, but I encourage anyone who thinks the difference is simply melanin to do some objective, fact finding research.</p>

		<p>To me Calling Blacks, African-American is out and out Racial Profiling. For one thing very few people are actually black and just because a person is black doesn&rsquo;t make them either African or American. There are many blacks in America who are neither from Africa or America. I am as white as the fallen snow and I was born in South Africa I became a Proud American at the age of 12 and under the law I can not call myself African-American because the title is reserved for blacks only.</p>

		<p>Saying African American is just so much more inconvenient than saying black. The difference is seven syllables versus one syllable. Besides, why should I say &#8220;African American&#8221; just because Jesse Jackson and a few elite black &#8220;scholars&#8221; started to demand we use that term? It&rsquo;s really just an attempt by many blacks to control what we can and can&rsquo;t say. </p>

		<p>One of my fellow educators is a woman from Kenya, and she adamantly refuses to be called African-American.  She says, &#8220;None of MY ancestors were slaves - that was for people from the WEST Coast of Africa, who sold their own people into slavery.  My people have always been free - I am a Kenyan and proud of it!&#8221;  Her husband, an American-born black, has a big problem with her position on this matter and he REALLY gets mad when she calls him a lazy black N-word and a whiner.  She can&rsquo;t stand his attitude of entitlement and is probably going to divorce him.</p>

<p>Bingo!</p>
<p>But no, seriously, the contributions of blacks in this country have been greatly inspirational. For instance: their child-like intellectual immaturity, emotional instability, psychopathic mentality, propensity toward violence and track record for turning every place they migrate into a God-forsaken hellhole have greatly inspired me to stay the hell away from them and work hard to keep them the hell away from me. </p>

		<p>The article seems to be a not so subtle way of arguing for blacks to be identified as &#8220;Americans&#8221; in order not to be associated with their history and current status. Unfortunately one cannot alter history and appearance.</p>

<p>Your  Kenyan  friend  should  be  informed  that  there was  slaving  on  the  Kenyan Swahili  coast  during precolonial  times.  And  the  captives  were taken mainly from the  interior,i.e.  from the  Luo, Kikuyu, etc.</p>
<p>Secondly, colonialism  was  just live  slavery, especially  in  those  areas  where  the  Europeans  settled, such  as  Kenya. There  was  forced  labour and  the  indigenous  Africans  lost  most  of the  lands they  traditionally  owned(usufruct). The  Africans  who  lost lands  were  then  herded  into &#8220;Native  Reserves&#8221; where  they  were  virtual  slaves:  they were  dragooned  into  forced  labour  gangs  to  build  roads, buildings and  crop  growing  activities.</p>
<p>It is for that  reason that  the  liberation  movement  in  Kenya  called  itself Mau Mau and  fought a  bloody  war against  the  colonials.  The goal  of the  struggle was &#8220;Uhuru&#8221; which  means  in Kikuyu &#8220;Freedom&#8221;.  Only slaves or  quasi  slaves  would  ever  have  to  fight for their  freedoms.</p>
