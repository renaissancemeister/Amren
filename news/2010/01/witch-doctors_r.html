<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/8441813.stm">Witch-Doctors Reveal Extent of Child Sacrifice in Uganda</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Whewell, BBC News, January 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A BBC investigation into human sacrifice in Uganda has heard first-hand accounts which suggest ritual killings of children may be more common than authorities have acknowledged.</p>
<p>One witch-doctor led us to his secret shrine and said he had clients who regularly captured children and brought their blood and body parts to be consumed by spirits.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a former witch-doctor who now campaigns to end child sacrifice confessed for the first time to having murdered about 70 people, including his own son.</p>
<p>The Ugandan government told us that human sacrifice is on the increase, and according to the head of the country&rsquo;s Anti-Human Sacrifice Taskforce the crime is directly linked to rising levels of development and prosperity, and an increasing belief that witchcraft can help people get rich quickly.</p>
<p>In the course of our investigation we witnessed the ritual torching of the shrine of a particularly active witch-doctor in northern Uganda by anti-sacrifice campaigners.</p>
<p>The witch-doctor allowed ceremonial items including conch shells and animal skins to be burned in his sacred grove after agreeing to give up sacrifice.</p>
<p>He told us that clients had come to him in search of wealth.</p>
<p>&#8220;They capture other people&rsquo;s children. They bring the heart and the blood directly here to take to the spirits.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They bring them in small tins and they place these objects under the tree from which the voices of the spirits are coming,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Asked how often clients brought blood and body parts, the witch-doctor said they came &#8220;on average three times a week  &mdash;  with all that the spirits demand from them.&#8221;</p>
<p>We saw a beaker of blood and what appeared to be a large, raw liver in the shrine before it was destroyed, although it was not possible to determine whether they were human remains.</p>
<p><b>Extortion</b></p>
<p>The witch-doctor denied any direct involvement in murder or incitement to murder, saying his spirits spoke directly to his clients.</p>
<p>He told us he was paid 500,000 Ugandan shillings (Â£160 or $260) for a consultation, but that most of that money was handed over to his &#8220;boss&#8221; in a nationwide network of witch-doctors.</p>
<p><br>
Head of the Anti-Human Sacrifice and Trafficking Task Force, assistant commissioner Moses Binoga of the Ugandan police, said he knew of the boss referred to  &mdash;  involved in one of five or six witch-doctor protection rackets operating in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The senior ones extort money from lower people because they deal in illegal things,&#8221; he told us.</p>
<p>Mr Binoga said police had opened 26 murder cases in 2009, in which the victim appeared to have been ritually sacrificed, compared with just three cases in 2007.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also have about 120 children and adults reported missing whose fate we have not traced. We cannot rule out that they may be victims of human sacrifice,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But child protection campaigners believe the real number is much higher, as some disappearances are not reported to police.</p>
<p><b>Activism</b></p>
<p>Former witch-doctor turned anti-sacrifice campaigner Polino Angela says he has persuaded 2,400 other witch-doctors to give up the trade since he himself repented in 1990.</p>
<p>Mr Angela told us he had first been initiated as a witch-doctor at a ceremony in neighbouring Kenya, where a boy of about 13 was sacrificed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The child was cut with a knife on the neck and the entire length from the neck down was ripped open, and then the open part was put on me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When he returned to Uganda he says he was told by those who had initiated him to kill his own son, aged 10.</p>
<p>&#8220;I deceived my wife and made sure that everyone else had gone away and I was with my child alone. Once he was placed down on the ground, I used a big knife and brought it down like a guillotine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if he was afraid he might now be prosecuted as a result of confessing to killing 70 people, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been to all the churches .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and they know me as a warrior in the drive to end witchcraft that involves human sacrifice, so I think that alone should indemnify me and have me exonerated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uganda&rsquo;s Minister of Ethics and Integrity James Nsaba Buturo believes that &#8220;to punish retrospectively would cause a problem &hellip;  if we can persuade Ugandans to change, that is much better than going back into the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Child protection activists in organisations such as FAPAD (Facilitation for Peace and Development) and ANPPCAN (African Network for the Prevention and Protection against Child Abuse and Neglect) have highlighted recent cases of ritual killing and called for new legislation to regulate so-called &#8220;traditional healers&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>Witness testimony</b></p>
<p>In some cases against alleged witch-doctors due to come to trial later this year, police will use the testimony of children who managed to survive abduction.</p>
<p>One such witness is a three-year-old boy called Mukisa, who was left for dead after his penis was hacked off by an assailant.</p>
<p>He survived thanks to quick work by surgeons, and later told police he had been mutilated by a neighbour who is known to keep a shrine.</p>
<p>Mukisa&rsquo;s mother told us: &#8220;Every time I look at him, I ask myself how his future is going to be  &mdash;  a man without a penis  &mdash;  and how the rest of the community will look at him, with private parts that can neither be attributed to a man or a woman. Every time I recall the normal birth that I had and the way Mukisa is now, it is like the end of the world.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The stereotypical image of witch doctors (which is no longer allowed in the media) is of shrunken heads, Africans dancing around in grass skirts and weird tribal masks. It seems the real image of witch doctors is no less barbaric.</p>

		<p>Tim:  actually dancing in a grass skirt is a great deal LESS barbaric than sacrificing a living child.  Butterflying it&rsquo;s neck.  Killing your own 10 year old.  No, gotta go with grass skirts being less barbaric.</p>

		<p>The oxymoron: <i>Uganda&rsquo;s Minister of Ethics and Integrity</i> practically jumps off the screen! Worse, the number of arrests for these atrocities is decreasing! Is this because occurrences of this act are declining, or are corrupt law enforcement officers turning a blind eye to it in return for something (such as the promise that they&rsquo;ll share in the wealth to be obtained from it)? Idiots. This reminds me of a fairly recent story about Africans who have taken to killing and dismembering albinos to sell their remains to witch doctors. Supposedly, their body parts have &ldquo;mystical&rdquo; powers. More idiots. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine a group of people being so naive, primitive, and backward in this modern time. It&rsquo;s also insane to see the type of hold that witch doctors can have over a modern population. I don&rsquo;t know, however, which is more stunning: the fact that the masses believe what the witch doctors say, or the fact that the witch doctors do.</p>

		<p>This only goes to show that many Africans living in Africa share the same twisted values and inhuman practices as their ancestors did thousands of years ago.  This steadfast refusal to evolve socially and morally is a universally common theme between the most of the world&rsquo;s blacks, Muslims and Hispanics&hellip;    </p>

<p>What better illustration of why blacks have nobusiness outside Africa.</p>
<p>The same evolutionary restrictions apparent in these people are the norm throughout sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that the entire Western World suffers from black crime and violence, wherever these people flee to?</p>

		<p>Africa, where you can butcher 70 children for personal profit, &#8220;repent&#8221; and face no punishment and get appointed to a high ranking government job. And you know when enough of these people get &#8220;asylum&#8221; in Europe and the US, white body parts will fetch a premium price!</p>

		<p>Pure, unmitigated evil and barbarism. Multiculturalism and diversity be damned. </p>
<p>This is why virtually all of sub-Saharan Africa is destitute and in perpetual turmoil. Yet the left romantacizes these people. </p>
<p>There is a reason the word &#8220;civilized&#8221; exists. It distinguishes those societies that have advanced beyond ignorance and barbarism from those that have not. It reminds me of the never ending claim by the left that American settlers &#8220;stole&#8221; the American Indians&rsquo; land. The truth is that the Indians never advanced beyond a stone-age culture, while the rest of the western world was progressing by leaps and bounds. It was therefore inevitable that a more advanced society would displace the Indians. If not us, it would have been someone else. </p>
<p><br>
Ah, the indigenous peoples of the earth have so much calm wisdom for us all, if only we would listen. /s</p>
<p>Seriously, this is Gaia-worship in its purest form. The horror we feel at the details of these atrocities is a Western horror. The belief in the value of all human life is a Western ideal that we take for granted.</p>
<p>It will vanish completely once &ldquo;Hey Hey Ho Ho, Western Civ has got to go&rdquo; is a reality.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think that this should be chalked up purely to &#8220;barbarism&#8221; of the people in question, although that too plays a part. Rather, this is what happens when you have witchcraft for a religion. Today we have witchcraft and various other forms of occultism spreading in the West as well, and this may well lead to similar situations, unless effectively curtailed by stricter law enforcement. But then again, maybe some of the law enforcers will become witches/occultists themselves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder that Christians in Africa believe in &#8220;devil&#8221; and &#8220;evil&#8221; a lot more than the Western ones. That&rsquo;s because they have to face the reality of the operation of evil (such as manifested by this bloodthirsty witchcraft) on a regular basis.</p>

Good point, Luminary. But to me, what&rsquo;s most stunning of all is that University-educated white &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; at the BBC still insist upon reporting such horrifying stone-age atrocities in their usual &#8220;nonjudgmental&#8221; and &#8220;culturally sensitive&#8221; way for fear of sounding &#8220;racist&#8221; against people who kill children to make &#8220;magic&#8221; from body parts. (Yes, I know that news orgs are supposed to be impartial like that   &mdash;   but the Beeb has no problem getting very judgmental indeed when the topic happens to be Nick Griffin or the BNP!) </p>
<p><br>
From the article: </p>

<i>He told us he was paid 500,000 Ugandan shillings (Â£160 or $260) for a consultation, but that most of that money was handed over to his &ldquo;boss&rdquo; in a nationwide network of witch-doctors.</i></p>
<p><br>
And there you have it, my friends, as concise a definition of Africa as you will ever need: A place that has no nationwide network of telephone lines, but <i>does</i> have a nationwide network of witch-doctors.</p>

		<p>If you do a search under &#8220;muti&#8221; which is the African name for human sacrifice, you will find many articles about this.  There was even a case of a young boy who was found in the Thames river in London.  </p>
