			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Murphy, Christian Science Monitor, January 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the wake of the Haiti earthquake, bloggers, twitter users, and radio talk-show hosts are replaying a debate that emerged in the US after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans and its majority black population: Does race effect how the media covers natural disasters and how the US responds?</p>
<p>Much of the discussion has centered around the slow flow of aid to Haitians and whether that compares to the chaotic and slow response to the flooding of much of the crescent city. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>US rapper Kanye West touched off a small controversy five years ago when he bitterly complained about the way the press had covered Katrina on a telethon for its victims.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate the way they portray us in the media,&#8221; he said at the time. &#8220;If you see a black family, it says they&rsquo;re looting. See a white family, it says they&rsquo;re looking for food.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those comments were largely spurred by a pair of photos that made their way around the internet at the time. One of a black man in New Orleans wading through water with a caption that said &#8220;a young man walks through chest deep water after looting a grocery store&#8221; and another photo moved the same day by the Associated Press of a white man and woman captioned &#8220;two residents wade through chest-deep water after finding bread and soda from a local grocery store.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though the two pictures were taken and captioned by different agencies, with different internal standards and styles, they fueled allegations of racism in media coverage. Similar allegations are surfacing now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that on the rubble-strewn streets of Port-au-Prince, roving bands have been breaking into stores and taking whatever they can get their hands on. The description of all this as &#8220;looting&#8221; (a term the Monitor has used in some of its coverage) has prompted some outrage.</p>
<p>Writing at the Huffington Post, Michael Shaw asks: &#8220;Is it &#8216;looting&rsquo; if people are starving and desperate, and have no other recourse but to &#8216;steal&rsquo; food? And then, what are the racial dynamics of using the term &#8216;looting&rsquo;  &mdash;  instead of &#8216;stealing,&rsquo; or just &#8216;taking&rsquo;  &mdash;  particularly when the photo specifically features young black men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Voice of America, for instance, reported on Monday that &#8220;Haitian police fired shots into the air to disperse large roving bands of scavenging looters as they swarmed across the capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Twitter user &#8220;Caremelkeya&#8221; wrote &#8220;it sickens me to see CNN focus on the looting in Haiti. Relief will alleviate the restlessness of the people. Don&rsquo;t demonize the victims.&#8221; User &#8220;dredful&#8221; wrote: &#8220;news reported #looting of food from destroyed grocery stores in Haiti that is not looting! #katrina reporting all over again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter user &#8220;pezchaz&#8221; wrote: &#8220;can we stop calling non-white natural disaster victims who are trying to survive by scavenging supplies &#8216;looters?&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>Natalie Hopkinson, media critic for the Root.com, argues that &#8220;Nearly five years ago .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the racial double standard in the news media covering a catastrophic tragedy were obvious. Hungry, desperate white survivors were &#8216;finding food&rsquo; while hungry, desperate black survivors were &#8216;looting&rsquo; for food. Since the earthquake hit Haiti, I don&rsquo;t know what is more troubling: That so many observers, including political strategist and New Orleans native Donna Brazile, have been drawing facile parallels between the two cities. Or that so many of those comparisons are turning out to be true.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be sure, it hasn&rsquo;t been about food in every case. There have been ugly scenes of gangs of men breaking into stores and stealing everything they can  &mdash;  and fighting one another for possession. CNN posted footage of one such incident, in which a boy was injured when a piece of concrete was thrown at his head.<br>

		<p>You know, it&rsquo;s one thing if you find food and it&rsquo;s going to spoil anyway due to lack of refrigeration  &mdash;  might as well eat it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite another to be fighting one another over plasma TVs or some shiny object.</p>

		<p>I seem to recall many telecasts of young black men carrying boxes and packages of goods during Hurricane Katrina. Specifically, I remember a video clip of a black youth with a stack of new jeans (at least a dozen pairs) running away from the helicopter that was video taping him, and another of a black man wading through the water with a box containing a DVD player perched on his shoulder. No electricity, no food or shelter, but he had his DVD player. These scenes of course are examples of looting. Taking bottled water and a few canned goods from the local supermarket in order to survive is not looting, but being resourceful at a time of extreme chaos.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about looting in Haiti, too early to know the backstories amidst the emergency and MSM coverage.  But I do know that while whites looted for food in NO, blacks looted for food, yes, but they also looted for goods, robbed homes, and raped women.  But I wouldn&rsquo;t expect someone like Natalie Hopkindson to notice or report on it and undermine her own political reporting style overall.</p>

<p>Looting food in a devastating crisis is understandable when you have nothing and have no assurance when help will arrive. I don&rsquo;t fault anyone for fighting to survive. Honestly, I can&rsquo;t say how I would behave if I or my family were starving.</p>
<p>However, we&rsquo;ve all seen the images of blacks looting items such as TVs and other non-essential goods.</p>
<p>Blacks are portrayed by the news media as they are (at least until people like Mr. West complain and the news media go out of their way to show blacks not acting in stereotypical fashion.)</p>

		<p>Actually, the word &#8220;looter&#8221; was adopted from the Hindustani word for &#8220;thief&#8221;.  Therefore &#8220;looter&#8221; is both accurate and multicultural!</p>

		<p>Like so many here have said, with blacks, you&rsquo;re damned if you do, and damned if you don&rsquo;t. Would a total news blackout about the events in Haiti be better to the world&rsquo;s liking?</p>
<p>They complain about no coverage. They complain about too much coverage. They complain about what they consider the &#8220;wrong&#8221; kind of coverage.</p>
<p>Now, some people are actually whining that, because of pictures showing Haitians &#8220;looting&#8221; stores and warehouses, people will not send shekels to Haiti. That&rsquo;s what makes them afraid. Not the looting itself, but the fact that the looting is being shown around the world.</p>

		<p>One thing that blacks always willfully forget is that one of the purposes of language is to DISCOURAGE and SHAME undesirable behavior. This watering down of the language so that juvenile delinquents are now merely &#8220;youths,&#8221; illegal aliens are &#8220;undocumented workers,&#8221; and vagrants are now &#8220;the homeless&#8221; as if their homes have somehow been wiped out in some kind of natural disaster, has the effect of actually encouraging the behavior that is criminal and destructive (thus the skyrocketing crime rate over the last 40 years). </p>
<p>Saying that blacks are more often accused of engaging in undesirable behavior is simply to acknowledge that blacks do in fact engage more often in said behavior. Blacks and their handlers have deviously turned the tables to vilify not those who engage in the undesirable behavior but those who simply point it out!</p>

		<p>Oh, I see.  We have another word to add to the list of tabooed terms that blacks find &#8220;offensive&#8221;.  Eventually, it may amount to half the dictionary!  We might as well stop speaking about blacks or referring to them in any way. That would be safer.</p>
<p>Oh, but then they would complain that they&rsquo;re being ignored. <br>

		<p>It says something when a word or an expression becomes associated with a particular type of person. It happens because it becomes obvious that an excessive number of that particular type person is exhibiting that behavior. TA DA. </p>

		<p>Perhaps the word &#8220;looting&#8221; can be changed to &#8220;pillaging &rapine;&#8221; but with the education system being what it is these 2 &#8220;new&#8221; terms might not be readily understood.</p>

		<p>Another case of the absurdity and of Political Correctness.</p>
<p>In fact, there has been a great deal of restraint in reporting the looting going on. The major media has been thoroughly indoctrinated with this hyper-sensitivity towards reporting the facts about what certain groups of people - especially blacks - are doing.</p>
<p>You have to read between the lines or search deep into articles to find the truth of what has been really going on in Port-au-Prince.</p>
<p>The fact is that the largely destroyed downtown area was COMPLETELY LOOTED within a few days of the earthquake. Completely looted, stores stripped, emptied, people carrying of everything, not just food. There&rsquo;s nothing left there to loot now. Nothing. All gone and carried off. There was a complete collapse of order there for a few days.</p>
<p>If anything, the scale of the looting has been underreported.<br>

		<p>Anyone remember Findlay Ohio being flooded a few winters back? It is a predominately white rural town in Hancock County Ohio, and although the flooding devistated the town; you saw No looting, no busted open jewelers or gutted Wal-Marts -just people pulling together with their fellow townsfolk to help themselves and eachother. The contrast to N.O. was as stark as -well- black and white. Haiti is no different, they ecologicaly and economically ruined their half of the island Hispanola all by themselves -despite repeated warnings that were dismissed as &#8216;racist&rsquo;. Just ask yourselves why is the focus on Haiti and not on the Dominican Republic -which occupies the other half of the same island.</p>

		<p>Anybody fooled by Kayne West&rsquo;s remark has a poor memory. Most of the White people in New Orleans heeded the government&rsquo;s warning to leave the city as Hurricane Katrina approached. The Blacks remained in anticipation of looting the stores while the Whites were gone. Of the Whites that remained, a substantial percentage did no looting because they already had food: they had prepared themselves to survive precisely that kind of emergency.</p>
<p>If you had watched the streets of New Orleans during the flood, you&rsquo;d have seen that at least 19 out of every 20 looters were Blacks. And whereas the White looters were indeed scavenging food (which would have spoiled soon anyway), the Blacks were stealing everything they could pick up and carry away, including clothes, handbags, jewelry, guns, ammunition, stereos, boom boxes, and plasma TV sets. Even Black New Orleans police officers joined in the looting.</p>
<p>There is no justice in equating what the Whites were doing with what the Blacks were doing, during the New Orleans flood. Kayne West was trying to revise history by implicitly falsely equating Whites and Blacks in terms of numbers of looters and what they were looting for.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to understand how race bears on behavior during emergencies, we must appreciate that whenever there is an emergency, the people who come running in to offer assistance in person, or to offer donations from afar, are mostly White people. Most Blacks don&rsquo;t do such things. Blacks usually help nobody but themselves, regardless of circumstances, not even when other Blacks are the victims of a disaster.</p>
<p>Almost every country in the world has given aid to Haiti. Most of the exceptions are African countries. Most African countries have NOT given any assistance to their fellow Blacks in Haiti.</p>
