<h1><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article24364.htm">Africom  &mdash;  Latest U.S. Bid to Recolonise Continent</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tichaona Nhamoyebonde, Herald (Zinbabwe), January 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>AFRICAN revolutionaries now have to sleep with one eye open because the United States of America is not stopping at anything in its bid to establish Africom, a highly-equipped US army that will be permanently resident in Africa to oversee the country&rsquo;s imperialist interests.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, the US government intensified its efforts to bring a permanent army to settle in Africa, dubbed the African Command (Africom) as a latest tool for the subtle recolonisation of Africa.</p>
<p>Just before end of last year, General William E. Garret, Commander US Army for Africa, met with defence attaches from all African embassies in Washington to lure them into selling the idea of an American army based in Africa to their governments.</p>
<p>Latest reports from the White House this January indicate that 75 percent of the army&rsquo;s establishment work has been done through a military unit based in Stuttgart, Germany, and that what is left is to get an African country to host the army and get things moving.</p>
<p>Liberia and Morocco have offered to host Africom while Sadc has closed out any possibility of any of its member states hosting the US army.</p>
<p>Other individual countries have remained quiet.</p>
<p>Liberia has longstanding ties with the US due to its slave history while errant Morocco, which is not a member of the African Union and does not hold elections, might want the US army to assist it to suppress any future democratic uprising.</p>
<p>Sadc&rsquo;s refusal is a small victory for the people of Africa in their struggle for total independence but the rest of the regional blocs in Africa are yet to come up with a common position. This is worrying.</p>
<p>The US itself wanted a more strategic country than Morocco and Liberia since the army will be the epicentre of influencing, articulating and safeguarding US foreign and economic policies.</p>
<p>The other danger is that Africom will open up Africa as a battleground between America and anti-US terrorist groups.</p>
<p>Africom is a smokescreen behind which America wants to hide its means to secure Africa&rsquo;s oil and other natural resources, nothing more.</p>
<p>African leaders must not forget that military might has been used by America and Europe again and again as the only effective way of accomplishing their agenda in ensuring that governments in each country are run by people who toe their line.</p>
<p>By virtue of its being resident in Africa, Africom will ensure that America has its tentacles easily reaching every African country and influencing every event to the American advantage.</p>
<p>By hosting the army, Africa will have sub-contracted its military independence to America and will have accepted the process that starts its recolonisation through an army that can subdue any attempts by Africa to show its own military prowess.</p>
<p>The major question is: Who will remove Africom once it is established? By what means?</p>
<p>By its origin Africom will be technically and financially superior to any African country&rsquo;s army and will dictate the pace for regime change in any country at will and also give depth, direction and impetus to the US natural resource exploitation scheme.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that as soon as the army gets operational in Africa, all the gains of independence will be reversed.</p>
<p>If the current leadership in Africa succumbs to the whims of the US and accept the operation of this army in Africa, they will go down in the annals of history as that generation of politicians who accepted the evil to prevail.</p>
<p>Even William Shakespeare would turn and twist in his grave and say: &#8220;I told you guys that it takes good men to do nothing for evil to prevail.&#8221;</p>
<p>We must not forget that Africans, who are still smarting from colonialism-induced humiliation, subjugation, brutality and inferiority complex, do not need to be taken back to another form of colonialism, albeit subtle.</p>
<p>Africom has been controversial on the continent ever since former US president George W. Bush first announced it in February 2007.</p>
<p>African leaders must not forget that under the Barack Obama administration, US policy towards Africa and the rest of the developing world has not changed an inch. It remains militaristic and materialistic.</p>
<p>Officials in both the Bush and Obama administrations argue that the major objective of Africom is to professionalise security forces in key countries across Africa.</p>
<p>However, both administrations do not attempt to address the impact of the setting up of Africom on minority parties, governments and strong leaders considered errant or whether the US will not use Africom to promote friendly dictators.</p>
<p>Training and weapons programmes and arms transfers from Ukraine to Equatorial Guinea, Chad, Ethiopia and the transitional government in Somalia, clearly indicate the use of military might to maintain influence in governments in Africa, remains a priority of US foreign policy.</p>
<p>Ukraine&rsquo;s current leadership was put into power by the US under the Orange Revolution and is being given a free role to supply weaponry in African conflicts.</p>
<p>African leaders must show solidarity and block every move by America to set up its bases in the motherland unless they want to see a new round of colonisation.</p>
<p>Kwame Nkrumah, Robert Mugabe, Sam Nujoma, Nelson Mandela, Julius Nyerere, Hastings Kamuzu Banda, Kenneth Kaunda, Augustino Neto and Samora Machel, among others, will have fought liberation wars for nothing, if Africom is allowed a base in Africa.</p>
<p>Thousands of Africans who died in colonial prisons and in war fronts during the liberation struggles, will have shed their blood for nothing if Africa is recolonised.</p>
<p>Why should the current crop of African leaders accept systematic recolonisation when they have learnt a lot from colonialism, apartheid and racism? Why should the current crop of African leaders fail to stand measure for measure against the US administration and tell it straight in the face that Africa does not need a foreign army since the AU is working out its own army.</p>
<p>African leaders do not need prophets from Mars to know that US&rsquo;s fascination with oil, the war on terrorism and the military will now be centred on Africa, after that escapade in Iraq.<br>

		<p>This is the real reason that the White nations were vilified and destroyed in Africa.</p>
<p>When they snubbed British and US rule, they painted a giant bullseye on their countries.  Now that the Black run countries have done a reversal of White civilization, the way is cleared for British and US interests to recolonize.  </p>
<p>The power game is almost complete by the Britsh/US power structure.  The only step left is recolonization.</p>
<p>Africans have never shown that they can organize very well on their own.  They always need White help to beat the White man and even then, they are merely used against rebel groups of Whites who are not playing along with the larger White power structure.</p>
<p>The fate of the former White ruled nations in Africa represent one of the great power games of our time.</p>
<p>When will colonization happen?  It&rsquo;s hard to tell exactly but give it a few years and pay careful attention to any and all Aid to Africa programs.  Eventually a call will be made for high numbers of workers to go there and get production back to pre-Black levels.</p>
<p>A vilification of the Black leaders will happen with some discussion about how they betrayed the principles of equality and how they should be deposed and replaced with more equitable US/British leaders (puppets).</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, Africa&rsquo;s new colonial masters export raw materials back to China at breakneck speed. </p>
<p>P.S. The female shortage in China has also apparently been solved as improbable hookup after hookup surfaces between asian males and their Bantu paramours. If anything, this practice should kick up IQ scores in a generation.</p>

<p>This is one of the funniest articles I have ever read on Amren.  Imagine the irony of it; a black writer who doesn&rsquo;t want any whites to come to live in Africa quotes an English playright from the dawn of colonial empire in order to demonstrate to black Africans that they need to do something to keep whites out of Africa.  Meanwhile, they expect to gain entrance into Europe and the U.S. at their request, just as they expect the gazillions of dollars to continue to be spent on attempts to stand them up on their own.</p>
<p>But the real story here may be that the U.S. Military is going to establish an African army by recruiting Africans in Africa.  I have already read about Africans serving in the U.S. Army in Iraq.  Service for citizenship has been a quiet recruiting tool for some time now.  Once they are in, they can be brought anywhere to serve, including the U.S.</p>

<p>Actually the Monroe Doctrine was the policy of keeping colonialism out of the Americas.  Then in 1904 came the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine which said that United States has the right to intervene to stabilize the economic affairs of small states in the Caribbean and Central America if they are unable to pay their international debts. <br>

<p>No, Mr.Tichaona Nhamoyebonde, Shakespeare said nothing of the illiterate sort.<br>
 <br>
However, Edmund Burke (another Britisher) wrote &#8220;All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>You got the wrong continent there.  If that were the case, the Monroe Doctrine was a crashing failure, as Africa was colonized.  The purpose of the Monroe Doctrine was to deny foreign powers colonies in the Americas.</p>
<p>I sympathise with Mr. Nhamoyebonde&rsquo;s point of view.  I also do not want the american military in Africa.  What a waste that would be - a pointless undertaking to colonize such a backward place.  And where ever our army goes (Vietnam, Somalia, Iraq, perhaps soon Afghanistan), streams of refugess bound for America follow.  I don&rsquo;t want Americans in Africa, nor do I want Africans to come here.</p>

		<p>Of course, I oppose ALL US occupation, intervention and military action abroad. Call me kooky, I just ascribe to the ideals of GEORGE WASHINGTON.<br>
But I wonder, though our wars abroad only bring a flood of odious thirdworlders to our once clean land, if there won&rsquo;t be an eventual upside;<br>
As browns swamp and kill the USA and Europe, I think our descendants may simply move to the once brown lands, and displace the remaining natives. Thus, people will simply change places: browns will move to and desecrate white lands, finally destroying them. Whites will begin anew in places like Africa and Latin America, making new paradises&hellip;let&rsquo;s hope Leftist multicult freaks are barred, because THEy are the disease that kills white lands. </p>

		<p>The writer is an imbecile. He makes it sound like brutality and racism are one-way streets, practiced only by the European colonial powers. He conveniently forgets African civil wars started in Nigeria (the war against Biafra), Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, Sierra Leone, Congo and Angola for example. Conflicts occurred in these nations long after they became independent.</p>
<p>This writer is exhorting Africa&rsquo;s leaders to stand together against what he sees as American imperialism. How can they, if they&rsquo;re lapping up the crumbs that China and the U.N. are tossing them? It&rsquo;s ALL ABOUT THE MONEY, Mister. It was about the money when Bantus from neighboring countries flocked into apartheid South Africa for dishwasher and busboy jobs.</p>
<p>I note the writer says Morocco is not a member of the African Union. Why not, because Morocco is predominantly white? NOW, who&rsquo;s being racist.</p>
<p>Since he became president, Obama has increased troops in Afghanistan, bombed Yemen and is now establishing a military command on his mother continent; if this writer is to be believed. Some of you Amrenners said over a year ago that Obama was going to suck up to his mother continent by pouring money into it. How right you were!</p>
<p>It also begs the question: What was Obama given the Nobel Peace Prize for? </p>

		<p>I agree with poster #3.  So many people hate us around the world because we&rsquo;ve meddled in their affairs for so many decades.  China is making a killing in Afghanistan on commodity contracts and mining while our troops fight the hillbilly taliban.  </p>
<p>Close all overseas U.S. bases. End all wars.  Make Puerto Rico independent and make all puerto ricans here move back there.  Bring the troops home.  </p>
<p>Close all immigration (except for maybe love marriages, - can&rsquo;t stand in the way of love! - but no bringing relatives along), Kick out all illegals.  Gang membership is an automatic crime that results in loss of citizenship and deportation (and if the person was born here, automatically send them to contracted penal colonies in African deserts).</p>
<p>Interpret the 14th amendment as it was orginally intended (only to secure the rights of freed slaves), retroactively kick out the illegals and revoke citizenship for anchor babies.  </p>
<p>This will solve almost all our problems.</p>

		<p>Trust me, no one in today&rsquo;s Army gives a rat&rsquo;s tail about africa.  No sane white person would shed blood over the zulus.  Right now we have offices in the Pentagon that work shelf plans for african contingency ops but it&rsquo;s all blacks working the plans&hellip;and females.  No one wants to touch it.  The blacks think these are cool jobs because it somehow lets them actually use their so-called african studies degrees.  What a waste as I can see something happening and next thing you know, 4ID or the 82D is sent in.  This sub-saharan africa has never had a stable black government since the dawn of time. What makes us think otherwise?  Glad I get to retire soon.  Blame the fools in the cbc for this boondoggle and folks like cold cash jefferson. </p>

		<p>The US has been organizing an African Multi-national Contingency Force for a number of years.  A friend of mine has been involved in it, which is the only way I have heard about it.  The idea is to have the continent of Africa take care of their own problems such as Rwanda in future.  So far as I know it has never been employed.</p>

		<p>The whole of sub-Saharan Africa is not worth one White life! Africans themselves are responsible for the deplorable mess they&rsquo;re in. Not us hated Whites. We do NOT need a permanent presence there. If we need raw materials, we PAY for them. Unlike China who made grandiose gestures of &#8220;gifts&#8221; and interest-free loans, then forces the recipients into virtual slavery.</p>

<p>Beyond that, the reporter is apparently confusing William Shakespeare with Edmund Burke. Edmund Burke, the brilliant Irish statesman, is reported to have said, &#8220;All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Burke also said the equally profound, &#8220;When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by one.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s true. What wikipedia doesn&rsquo;t point out is that many times it was used in Asian and Africa in anti-colonial posturing by the US government, sometime backed up by force. American soldiers died enforcing the Monroe doctrine. Not many, but some. </p>

<p>Yeah, the Monroe Doctrine applies/applied to the Western Hemisphere and has nothing to do with Africa.</p>
<p>Stuttgart for a very long time was the headquarters of EUCOM, or European Command for joint U.S. Forces. I&rsquo;m not sure that it still is, with all the changes since my military days, but it&rsquo;s not exactly imbecilic to refer to a U.S. command being based there. EUCOM is different from USAREUR, U.S. Army Europe in Heidelberg, and also different from SHAPE, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in Brussels.</p>
<p>That said, I agree with many of the posters. We&rsquo;re WAAAY in debt and spread out all over the world, often for no particular reason IMO. Can a journalist anywhere be blamed for writing an article that concludes that we love to mess with other people militarily at the smallest provocation?</p>

<p>Agreed. The American taxpayer should not be forced to pay to defend foreign soil, let the Europeans, Asians and others fully pay for their own defence. Our troops and military are here to defend American soil not somebody else&rsquo;s. Put them on the borders of Mexico to keep out terrorists, illegals and drug runners. Put them on the Canadian border to keep out terrorists who might come in through Canada . Also, all these wars around the globe, Iraq and Afghanistan etc. are not worth one drop of American blood. Bring our boys and girls home. No wars unless we need to defend ourselves.</p>

		<p>Having served in the military (Viet-Nam 7/66-11/69) and working WITH the military in OIF/OEF for the past 6 years I can say that the military involvement in foreign countries is not just about occupation/defense, it is BIG BUSINESS! Also, I would point out that I, personally, am under no illusions that by bringing our troops home that things would be OK! the enemy (muslims) would consolidate their hold on the rest of the weak world and then turn on us, by which time, our government will have allowed the immigration of millions of muslim foot soldiers for the initial assault on America. End Game!</p>
