			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anthony Calypso, The Grio, January 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Darcelle &#8216;Darcey&rsquo; McGinnis opened her seafood café last fall she counted on her signature garlic blue crab dish and a little Southern charm as a way to satisfy her customers. Although her Atlanta area restaurant is relatively young and most likely prone to new start-up headaches, one of the things that McGinnis never expected was the way that some of her African-American customers failed to leave behind a tip or gratuity. Almost right away McGinnis, a 38-year-old former social worker turned entrepreneur, noticed the difference between the tips she received from her African-American and white clientele.</p>
<p>According to McGinnis this past week an African-American NFL player patronized the café and left without tipping. &#8220;He pulled out not a small amount of money, but a wad .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I just had to experience [this] firsthand,&#8221; says McGinnis who runs Bushels Seafood Café, a mom and pop style establishment with her husband and one additional worker. &#8220;I never paid attention before but I&rsquo;ve noticed [here] that our white customers tip more than our black customers who come through.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. William Michael Lynne, a full professor of consumer behavioral marketing at Cornell University&rsquo;s School of Hotel Administration has been examining the relationship between gratuities and race since the late-80s but due to what he saw as a politically sensitive topic, Dr. Lynne only recently began to discuss some of the implications attached to the subject. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a dirty secret in the industry that there is a wide spread perception that blacks don&rsquo;t tip well,&#8221; says Lynne. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Lynne who has conducted surveys in targeted areas of he U.S. as a well as telephone interviews across the nation, believes that at least some of the evidence from a compiled research paper titled, &#8220;Race Difference in Tipping&#8221;, first published in 2006, supports the negative perception of blacks and tipping.</p>
<p>According to Lynne, one study from the paper concluded that among whites, blacks, Hispanics and Asians, blacks gave or claimed to give the lowest average tip. In another survey from the same report blacks were more than twice as likely as whites to leave a flat dollar amount instead of a gratuity reflecting a percentage of the bill. Part of Lynne&rsquo;s research also came from opinions and data collected from restaurant servers. {snip}</p>
<p>Lynne&rsquo;s research also revealed that a third of whites within the study did not know the standard amount accepted for gratuities. Lynne who has continued to update his research findings, believes that there is no single answer as to why blacks might tend to tip less. {snip} &#8220;Ultimately, says Lynne, &#8221; the restaurant industry .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is less likely to open up restaurants in black communities even if they are affluent communities because of this race difference in tipping.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Wendi Williams, a Southern California native with a doctorate in counseling psychology, believes that even if blacks and whites have similar socioeconomic backgrounds the difference in tipping etiquette might have to do with the actual amount of disposable income within a black household. {snip}</p>
<p>Along that possible nuance, Williams who dines out approximately at least once a week says that she has noticed a difference in service when dining out with blacks versus eating out with mixed groups at restaurants. &#8220;I never receive poor service when [dining] out with whites [or] Asians and it never happens if there is a white male in the group,&#8221; adds Williams. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve heard of the stereotypes [yet] I believe that [some] blacks are over tipping in order to not be identified as that sort of black since we tend to internalize oppression and prejudice.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not a secret and it is not just a perception, as he well knows.  </p>
<p>&#8220;internalize oppression and prejudice&#8221;?  Now they&rsquo;re whining they&rsquo;re oppressed because THEY are stiffing low wage employees?<br>
&#8220;might have to do with the actual amount of disposable income within a black household.&#8221;  If you don&rsquo;t have the disposable income to tip, then you don&rsquo;t go out to eat at a restaurant.  Period.  Servers often make under minimum wage AND have to pay a certain percent of their sales (3% or so) in &#8220;tip share&#8221; to bartenders and hostesses.  This means when some &#8220;special table&#8221; stiffs you, you the server are literally paying for them to eat at the restaurant.</p>
<p>Most blacks themselves know what they&rsquo;re doing.  I even had them laugh about it in front of me when I was a server.</p>

		<p>This article is right up my alley. I work in the service industry here in Las Vegas and I can tell you emphatically that Whites tip way better than non-whites! Mexicans are the worst and blacks are pretty bad too. If I did not get so many White customers I would not be able to pay my bills! I am not joking. Whites respect good service, the others expect it but do not get it from me anymore!</p>

<p>Makes sense to me. I have a black subordinate of mine that I occastionally have to eat lunch with and I have noticed he barely tips at all. He pulls in less than half of what I earn yet drives a car worth three times more than mine.</p>
<p>No wonder blacks always complain about not getting good servce.</p>

		<p>Nothing new here. I&rsquo;ve heard the same story from virtually every person I&rsquo;ve ever known who&rsquo;s waited a table. Blacks are the rudest, most obnoxious and demanding, but won&rsquo;t leave any kind of tip. Take the famous Scottie Pippin (no-tippin Pippin) formerly of the Chicago Bulls. He&rsquo;s notorious for dining with friends and racking up bills of 1k or more, and not leaving a single dollar tip. No wonder waitresses and waiters run from having to wait on black diners. </p>

<p>EVERYONE knows it but it&rsquo;s not allowed to be spoken of in polite company.</p>
<p>Blacks will use any perceived slight (largely imagined) not to tip. I&rsquo;ve never worked at a restaurant but I know family members and friends who have and all of them cringe at being assigned to black customers. They know what trouble they&rsquo;re going to get and also that there&rsquo;s no payoff coming.</p>

		<p>Talk to any waitress and they will all tell you the same thing. Blacks are the worst possible customers; rude, obnoxious, loud, demanding and terrible tippers. In one sense it&rsquo;s ironic because a lot of black males like to be perceived as big spenders and have a fixation on bling (you see this in how blacks spend their money) but still, blacks are the worst customers to have. This is probably true of blacks in other businesses too. Maybe its that deeply ingrained false sense of entitlement so many blacks have. </p>

		<p>I was once a cab driver and remember quite well the blacks who would ride in my cab.  On Saturdays, black women would pair up to hire a cab to the grocery store together.  Sometimes they would each bring a mess of kids, which is no problem if you have a minivan cab.  Mine was a sedan.  </p>
<p>They would fill the trunk with grocery bags, and a Crown Victoria has a huge, cavernous trunk.   If the fare on the meter was $4.90, they would hand me $4 and then dig around in their pockets and purses for 90 cents.  It would never occur to them to give even a 10 cent tip.  </p>
<p>Sometimes there would be men sitting on the porch when we got back to their house, but they would be drinking out of the biggest beer bottles you&rsquo;ve ever seen and not do a thing to help unload the cab.  I would pitch in to unload, not because I wanted to help, but because the sooner they were out of the cab, the sooner I could be on to the next fare.  Also, I could keep an eye on the equipment in the trunk.</p>

		<p>The tipping trends between blacks and whites are a mirror image of one another&hellip;.Whites tip about 90% of the time, whereas blacks tip about 10% of the time&hellip;I worked off and on in different pizza shops over the years whenever I fell on hard times or just needed extra money for whatever&hellip;And yes, I always felt badly about the one or two blacks I would encounter that overtipped me&hellip;It was obvious they were doing it out of embarrassment of those who didnt tip&hellip;.Nobody knows blacks better than blacks&hellip;</p>

<p>They can package it up any way they want.  In the end there is only one reason&hellip;.. C-H-E-A-P!!!  Blacks love to take, they hate to give and tipping is one medium that proves it.  Take any aspect of society be it donating one&rsquo;s time, clothing, or money and you&rsquo;ll find that blacks are on the low end of the scale.</p>
<p>I remember eating at a local restaurant - family style (order at counter, waitress serves).  My son and I were joined by two black women and one black man.  After they finished their meals, the elder black woman put down a few bucks.  No sooner had her hand left contact with the paper when the other two blacks say to her - in unison - &#8220;What&rsquo;s that for?&#8221;  Her response was incoherent from my point but her tip stayed on the table.  I put down a few bucks and left.  My son picked up on what happened without me saying a word.  He was just 12-years old at the time!<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve waited tables at three different restaurants.  The behavior of  some of my black customers was absolutely appalling.  Black parents did not discipline their children, and when they did, it was with physical and verbal roughness. </p>
<p>What was even worse, though, was working with blacks.  They are unwilling to cooperate with ANY white co-worker.  One black girl told me that &#8220;taking orders&#8221;  from a white   &mdash;   even one in a managerial position   &mdash;   would be a display of a &#8220;slave mentality.&#8221; </p>
<p>So let me get this straight&hellip;your great-great grandfather was enslaved, so that&rsquo;s why you won&rsquo;t sweep out the crumbs from your row of tables, circa 2007? </p>
<p>What utter nonsense. </p>

		<p>I worked as pizza delivery driver in college.  I kept tip statistics with several variables, race was one of them.  The average black tip was something like 11 cents vs  $1.61 for whites.  The black number was skewed because I had one black customer that always tipped $5.  Blacks didn&rsquo;t tip the black drivers any better.  Black drivers never wanted to take the black runs.  There were approximately 8 driver assaults in the time period I worked, you guest it, all were by blacks.  When ownership refused to deliver to black areas where assaults had occurred they cried discrimination.</p>

		<p>   A friend of mine has owned his own restaurant for many years. Not only do they not tip, but they also complain about their service the most and about the food itself. You cannot make them happy. They know the prices, and yet they complain about the amount of their check.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t go to lunch with my co-workers for this very reason. One of the two blacks I work with NEVER tips. Yet he will ask for items not on the menu,e.g. raspberry iced tea(as close as he could get to Kool-Aid), red peppers on a philly cheesesteak. Recently he asked a waiter if the italian sub had baloney on it. How moronic!<br>
  It just became too embarassing for me; I also wondered if our food was being dosed with any sort of &#8220;extras&#8221; that are served to jerk customers (you know it happens).</p>

This is what is behind those Denny&rsquo;s scandals years ago.  If you recall, in the &rsquo;90s a few Denny&rsquo;s restaurants across the US got sued for not severing blacks.  Denny&rsquo;s was forced pay millions to various black customers and institutions.  They thought there was some formal policy in place against blacks, but what I think what was really going on is that Denny&rsquo;s workers across the US independently and spontaneously knew that blacks don&rsquo;t tip so they acted accordingly.  No big conspiracy was afoot.</p>

		<p>Having worked in many very hi-end restaurants I can say this is no secret that blacks tip poorly if at all and not do to income as we&rsquo;ve had plenty of wealthy professional blacks as costumers and the overwhelming majority tip a strait 10% excluding wine at best for continental sevice where a base tip standard is 30% +. The other group of bad tippers are &#8220;Rock Stars&#8221; (Mick Jager &amp; Bruce Springsten to name a few )that allways come in late and late for the reservation with way fewer than the reservation was made (at the last min.) and leave no tip even after hours of unwinding in the now closed restaurant with all the staff having to wait till they leave so that they can do their side work for the next day</p>

		<p>Another anecdote for you: Spouse and I were on a roadtrip, we stopped for lunch at the IHOP in Plattsburgh, NY off the interstate. Just as we were pulling into the parking lot, a large charter bus is about to pull out. The bus is full of blacks. We walk into the restaurant and are seated. Waitress says hello, brings water, menus and asks us to be patient as she and the cook are only ones working-though she called a coworker to come in and help. I mentioned that she must have been swamped with that charter bus that just left. She said yeah, she was but she got everyone served on time, had no complaints, etc. She then said the entire group (30 or so) left her a total of $8 in tips. </p>

		<p>I certainly think diposable income (and age, be it mental or chronological) has to do with this phenomenon. When I was a very young (and cash-poor) man, I was tighter with tipping, doing the customary minimum (15%),  sometimes less, if service was poor. But I would have been ashamed to appear a heartless tightwad in front of a girlfriend. <br>
Now that I&rsquo;m more prosperous, I tip quite generously, sometimes about 40%. Let&rsquo;s say I spend 40-50 bucks on dinner and drinks for me and my girlfriend (and ahe pays just as often), I figure 20% is bare minimum, and what&rsquo;s 20% on 50 bucks? ten bucks&hellip;which is chump change in these inflationary times. What&rsquo;s another ten bucks to me, if I eat out once or twice a week? Not worth worrying over!. <br>
 Eating out is a luxury, I eat at nice places with great food at reasonable prices, and, what do you know, the bartenders/waitstaff all treat me like a FRIEND every time, giving me extras, perks, large pours of wine, etc, of their own accord. They always go the extra mile. <br>
You see, you will never regret generosity. It comes back to you manyfold. Plus, you feel at home wherever you go, because people are happy to see you, and please you. You have friends, because you understand what pays their bills. Maybe since I get paid by clients for one-on one time, I especially appreciate SERVICE and customer loyalty.</p>
<p>But if more blacks/mexicans are poorer, or of a younger mental age (ie: low IQ), they will never figure this maxim out, and instead short themselves and everyone else, to save some change.</p>
<p>PS: the one place I never tip a CENT, is Chipotle&hellip;I know I should never eat there, but it seems roughly healthy, fresh food. If I&rsquo;m in a hurry, I need something that resembles real food, and there are few choices. But since MCtraitor&rsquo;s owns it, and hires a preponderance of Meximatans, etc, I will NOT subsidize their presence.<br>
I just hope they wash their third world hands!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve worked in restaurants in the past and most blacks are horrible tippers. And the worst thing about it is they are the worst patrons to wait on. I think some of them complain and cause trouble as an <i>excuse</i> to not tip. So not only do they stiff you on the tip but they&rsquo;re a pain in the neck about it, too.</p>

<p>Well Comrade McGinnis, welcome to the real world!</p>
<p>This is not your Social Non-Workers&rsquo; Anti-Racist Paradise, but an instructive insight as to how blacks and other nonwhites &ldquo;fit&rdquo; into a white normative society!!!</p>
<p>I waited tables for a long time, straight through: college, graduate school, and even after graduate school early in my psychology career. It was no secret that blacks were the worst tippers, and most other nonwhites came equally close to them in their parsimonious gratuities. Of course, nonwhites always want the best service, and wallow in their ignorant arrogance while demanding it. However, no matter how attentive the server, the reward is always the same, little to nothing. </p>
<p>For white servers of blacks it is hellish on the tip end; for a black waiter or waitress, it is mostly even worse. It was apparent to me, that they seem to take a peculiar pleasure in degrading and stiffing &ldquo;their own.&rdquo; One black waitress I worked with, was so abused and uncompensated for it in tips by her &ldquo;own,&rdquo; that she openly asked at a staff meeting to be allowed limited black patrons. As most of her fellow wait staffers (including myself) had seen what she went through with 99.999999% of them and respected her abilities greatly, it became an unwritten rule to allow for this, except in the highest traffic hours in the place.   </p>
<p>I could go on and on, but why bother?</p>
<p>I have made my point!</p>

		<p>Many blacks are not even generous within their own ethnic group.  Their attitude is that people are out to get what they can, and you&rsquo;re a dupe if you give.  They don&rsquo;t generally give to charities and don&rsquo;t adopt.  The U.S. and countries like Haiti are full of unwanted black kids, yet do American blacks take them?  Yet when non-black Americans decide to adopt a black child, some black social worker cries foul!  The TV liberals are already bemoaning that black children might be &#8220;stolen&#8221; from Haiti.  <br>
Too many blacks see bigotry where there either is none or none is on display.  I wouldn&rsquo;t do business where I felt someone looked down on me or hated giving me service, yet they constantly troop into such places and then complain.  I guess they have to exercise their rights.  They&rsquo;re 12-13% of the U.S. population and doomed to grow no larger.  If a proprietor doesn&rsquo;t have a business in the ghetto, I don&rsquo;t know why he would care if blacks patronize it.  Almost every time there&rsquo;s a problem with blacks, it&rsquo;s with their behavior, and there&rsquo;s no law against ejecting customers for that.  I look for a day when the courts decide that private businesses can discriminate in any way they please.</p>

		<p>It is doubly bad for the servers because the blacks know they are supposed to tip, so they justify NOT tipping by finding something to complain about. They will torture the server to justify not tipping which just adds insult to injury.</p>
<p>I find it surprising that a black woman would open a restaurant in a black area and be surprised by this fact. There is a reason restaurants in black areas don&rsquo;t offer table service.</p>

		<p>I have never worked in the food service arena, I have little to no tolerance for rude, uncivil behavior, but family and freinds have done so and frome their experiences and my observations I can tell you that not only are the blacks poor tippers, they make a HUGE MESS! the bigger the party, the bigger the mess and again, no tip. ALSO! relative to working with take out pizza! a recognized indicator of the safety of a neighborhood is indicated by where pizza delivery WILL NOT deliver. This is a better indicator than school quality.</p>

		<p>I managed a nightclub years ago. We had to pay extra to the cocktail staff to work on &#8220;urban night&#8221; because the black crowd tipped very little and usually not at all, and the income for the cocktail staff was primarily based on tips.  Conversely, there were plenty of volunteers for &#8220;Country-Western Night&#8221; because the rednecks and cowboys were well known for excessive tipping.</p>

		<p>Is this even debatable?  There is no &#8220;secret&#8221;, blacks don&rsquo;t tip.<br>
I noticed that the article didn&rsquo;t touch on the fact that they are also the most demanding and unhappy customers, looking for a free lunch on the planet.  Then they still don&rsquo;t tip.</p>
<p>Ask black waiters/bartenders and they&rsquo;ll tell you the same thing.</p>
<p>Best ex. was back when i waited tables, these 2 black women would come in all the time and order water with extra lemon and use all the sugar to make their own lemonade, and a big mess, and never leave a tip.</p>
<p>They worked in the builing and would come down for a break/smoke.</p>

		<p>My comment is not so much about how I have seen non-whites tip but of when I was served by a certain black waiter at a chain &#8220;italian restaurant&#8221; here in the Charlotte area a few months back. </p>
<p>I usually try to get a white server when I go to restaurants because I just seem to get better service if the waiter/waitress is caucasian or &#8220;non-black&#8221;. I decided to take my wife out to eat that night after a day of leisurely activities and let her pick the restaurant of her choosing. She saw an &#8220;  &mdash;    &mdash;  - Garden&#8221; restaurant (which I detest mostly because I feel their food is LOUSY for the price and they are a prime example of &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; hiring) and decided she wanted to eat there. I reluctantly agreed and we sat in the foyer, waiting to be seated.<br>
I saw numerous white servers and was hoping to be seated at one of their tables but low-and-behold (as my luck would have it) I got seated in &#8220;Tyrones&#8221; section. This server had &#8220;dooky braids&#8221; and saggin&rsquo; pants and just looked totally unprofessional and so unbecoming of any restaurant that would try to impress clientele. His speach was that of ghetto-slang and he didnt even try to hide it. It was like getting served by one of Snoop Doggy Doggs entourage members for that matter. He barely came to check on us and our glasses were only filled once in the hour and a half we were there. When asking questions about menu items his replies were something like, &#8220;Yeah, I like dey Luh-zahn-ya&hellip; It be reel good, and stuff&hellip;&#8221; type ghetto-banter (all the while he was talking his jibberish he would finish with a &#8220;you-knowuh-I&rsquo;m-sayin&rsquo;&#8221;).</p>
<p> I usually give servers the benefit of the doubt so to speak (i.e. if its busy/cooks messes up order of organization) but his swagger and professionalism was totally lacking. I dont plan on ever returning to said restaurant. They will never get a dollar from me again. I hit these kind of establishments where it hurts&hellip;. my wallet. From now on when I step into an establishment, I know within&rsquo; 2 minutes if I plan to eat there or not when I count the number of black servers they have on staff.</p>

		<p>Millions and millions of service industry workers (af all races) have witnessed this, yet it CANNOT be true.  It is racist to notice, think about, mention it, or discuss it. Therefor, the notion is 100 percent false.</p>
<p>However, if Chris Rock did a stand-up routine devoted solely to this topic, pointing out reasons why, when, where, and to who it occurs 20,000 people would laugh and applaud hysterically.  Evidence that everybody knows about it but it is racist for those being slighted to talk about it.</p>

		<p>This article really brought home some memories for me.  I worked for the government in Chicago and remember one time when there was a Christmas party held at a well known landmrak building in the city.  Most of the employees that attended this shindig were Black.  Anyway, there must have been over fifty people at this affair and the restaurant&rsquo;s staff did a superior job in serving all of the attendees but when it came time to pay the tab, not one dime was left for a tip.  The food service manager even went so far as to phone the the department head who had scheduled the affair in order to determine if the service was bad.  I don&rsquo;t know what the conversation was about but I do know that there were no future parties held there.</p>
<p>Another example comes to mind also when I went to San Francisco with a colleague who happened to be a Black woman.  We attneded a convention in that city and on the day we left the hotel she &#8216;stiffed&rsquo; the bellhop who had brought her bags down from the room and loaded them into the taxi. I tipped the guy the going rate of $2 oer bag. She didn&rsquo;t give the guy a dime and he really worked for his money that day.  They are just like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also heard from others that Blacks just do not tip.  They expect to be waited upon and served just as they expect security from the cradle to the grave.</p>

<p><br>
A related anomaly is the black funeral industry. Among my black, college educated and 70K plus co workers, it is not uncommon for funeral notices for parents or grandparents of employees posted. Frequently these notices from our HR dept make requests for cash to cover burial expenses for the deceased! The funeral homes serving these people will not take a check!  I deal with this on a regular basis, and can tell you that black funeral directors know their clientele, and granny is not going to the cemetery till the bill is paid in cash. Families frequently &#8220;pass the hat&#8221; to satisfy the bills before the hearse rolls.  More of that lack of forward-thinking-skills I assume. </p>

		<p>This needs not even be discussed! Empirical evidence suggests its true, as where can one find a sit down, tip your waitstaff restaurant in a black neighborhood? </p>
<p> If blacks tipped, the chains would be all over those areas. As it stands now, the blacks who want &#8216;fine dining&rsquo; find their way over to Red Lobster near my home, make a mess, and dont tip. The whites going there are what keeps the place open. I cant stand those places, as I know the urban element will eventually destroy the operation. Old Country Buffet works in those urban areas, as theres almost no tipping&hellip;..I know a steak place with great food and LOUD country music. The owner owns several other restaurants, and theres no mistake why country is played there at a noticeable volume. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that joke again about the difference between  some ethnic group and a canoe? The canoe may tip! </p>

		<p>Back when I waited tables in college, we discreetly referred to black customers as &#8220;Canadians&#8221;. Everyone knew a table full of &#8220;Canadians&#8221; would be surly, demanding, unruly, messy, loud, and wouldn&rsquo;t leave a penny extra. In fact, they were just as likely to stiff you, forcing you to dip into your own wallet to make up the difference.</p>

<p>&#8220;The custom of tipping is disgusting and demeaning to giver and recipient.</p>
<p>If restaurants and so on pay decent wages, they ought to add the cost to the bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree with you.  I lived and worked for a while in Slovenia.  Tips are not customary there.  Except for a few exceptions, like the McDonald&rsquo;s in Ljublijana, people working at restaurants (gostilnas) actually own them.  The gostilnas (guest houses) are always clean and staffed by family.  They dress neatly and serve with dignity and class.  When I returned to the U.S. I went through a sort of culture shock at the terrible service.  Here you get everything from the waitress who is constantly buzzing your table, asking questions while your mouth is full, to those who seem to feel that friendliness means talking about themselves, to frankly sloppy service and neglect.  But they all expect a big tip.  In the U.S. I do tip and I always try to justify a 20% tip because I once had a girlfriend who waited tables and I saw what she went through.  She was a pretty redhead and the black women treated her terribly all the time never leaving a tip at all.  Guys hit on her all the time,  often making lewd comments.  She often came home nearly in tears.<br>

		<p>I know this article is about blacks and tipping, but I work at a supermarket and black customers tend to be much more difficult to deal with and far more unappreciative of the service they recieve when compared with whites. They almost never say &#8220;Thank You&#8221; (even if you go out of your way to do them a favor) and they are a lot more likely than white customers decide against buying items that they bring with them to the check-out. Sometimes they don&rsquo;t even bother handing what they don&rsquo;t want to the cashier; they just leave in the magazine racks, including items that require refrigeration. So from my experience at a grocery store, blacks are the rudest and most inconsiderate customers that anyone could ever wait on. </p>

		<p>I used to be an event site manager, and would dread events such as black weddings. One time, the groom invited about 20 extra guests without informing the bride or the cater  &mdash;  they all showed up. There were no tables, chairs, dishes, glassware, etc.  (rental company had brought the standard number needed for the &#8220;official guests&#8221;  &mdash;  no one expected that kind of overage). The caterer was going out of her mind because there was not that much extra food  &mdash;  twenty more people had to be fed, etc.<br>
Long story short, caterer never did get paid for the overage, and as I recall, we had to call the cops that night, for some slight had metastacized into a brawl. C&rsquo;est la vie with certain demographics&hellip; </p>

		<p>Its not just tips at restaurants. Its every aspect of life. I never see blacks donate blood. I have donated blood for 25 years and live in a heavily racially mixed area. I&rsquo;ve never seen blacks volunteer for charity organizations, or environmental causes. They are known to be the least likely to donate organs or to adopt children. Blacks just don&rsquo;t have a charitable spirit or any sense of generousity. They don&rsquo;t do these types of things because there isn&rsquo;t anything in it for them. For blacks its all about &#8216;getting something over on someone&rsquo; and only a &#8220;sucker&#8221; gives something away. Altruism is basically alien to blacks and their cultural outlooks. This is true of blacks EVERYWHERE. Look at Haiti, or anywhere in the West Indies. Its the same in Africa. This lack of altruism, generousity, or doing something for others, reflects a basic lack of &#8220;human capital&#8221; and probably goes a long way to explain why black societies are so inadequate and dysfunctional. In the USA you can also add in the entitlement mentality too.</p>

		<p>Re the Tiger Woods anecdote. I&rsquo;m not sure what town it was, but it might have been L.A. It went something like this. There was a lady who made all of the travel, dining, and entertainment arrangements when His Highness visited, kind of like a private concierge/tour guide. I&rsquo;m guessing this didn&rsquo;t include escorts. She accompanied him and his entourage while they were in town.  She said she had to give it up, because everytime he was in town, it ended up costing her money, as he would NEVER tip anyone, and as she performed these services for others and was well known, she ended up leaving the tips, as it would reflect badly on her on future visits to restaurants, clubs, etc. </p>

		<p>This story is all too true&hellip; As someone who delivered pizzas for several years in different locations the lack of tips from the black community was all too evident. There were the few decent blacks that would leave a large tip, almost as if they felt bad about their fellow blacks non-tipping habits. We actually cut off a section of our area due to assaults, roberies and rip offs. One evening I had an order stolen by loud screaming blacks who said that the order was late. Unfortunately for them I called the sheriff (it was actually a rural area) who came by the restaurant later to thank us since they were looking for several of the miscreants. Another family in a low income apartment complex would order a hugely topped pizza, complain that it was uncooked and order another pizza. Amazingly this happened several times before an intellegent manager put a stop to it and quit delivering to the complex. I could go on and on like this but to put it in a nutshell the best tippers were Whites living in lower middle class areas, Hispanics always seemed to tip even if they did not have much money and nobody wanted to go on black runs. </p>

		<p>I work in a franchise restaurant where we have to tip out 3% of our sales to hosts, bartenders, and busboys. It sickens me when I bust my butt for an hour and everything goes perfectly with no complaints to be left with no tip at all from blacks. I do not like working for free. They have this sense of entitlement and no matter how good of service you give, they won&rsquo;t tip you anyway. I tell the hosts not to sit me with blacks and even the black servers say the same thing. I was raised to always tip at least the bare minimum of double the tax (here in New York that is 18%). So when I started serving, I was blown away at the disregard and nerve of these people.</p>

&#8220;If at all possible, do NOT get behind blacks in a check-out line.&#8221;  </p>
<p>There usually will be some sort of problem - even if the black customer only has one or two items - and you will be stuck there for quite a while while the manager is summoned to sort things out.</p>

		<p>Good points one and all.  I like the observation that high end restaurants don&rsquo;t want to be in black communities.  The business model doesn&rsquo;t work there.  Buffets or counter ordering is the way to go.</p>
<p>Same goes for retail stores.  Why do you think there are few grocery stores, big box stores or high end retail in DC and PG county?  The theft rate is through the roof.</p>
<p>Talk to any manager of a high end chain and ask them which store in their chains have the highest shrinkage, theft, returns etc. <br>
I&rsquo;m guessing there will be a pattern.</p>

		<p>Substandard service and lack of quality is also applicable to the bantu races.  They seem to want to &#8220;get one over&#8221; on the white man.<br>
I recently visited a relative in a hospital in Royal Oak Michigan.  Upon concluding my visit, I decided that I would stop at the local Kroger store (13 Mile and Woodward) to pick up a few items.  I should have walked out immediately.  The stench from produce on the floors, items misplaced and the general (un)cleanliness and ATTITUDES of the predominently black workers should have been a sign that all was not well.  Attempting to purchase my few items was an adventure in itself.  I had to wait for the &#8220;shucking and jiving&#8221; to cease before they would ring up my purchases.<br>
I have always made it a point NOT to shop where blacks are in the majority.</p>

		<p>&#8220;According to McGinnis, this past week an African-American NFL player patronized the café and left without tipping. &ldquo;He pulled out not a small amount of money, but a wad.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t pleased with the food or the service. Maybe he didn&rsquo;t like the &#8220;attitude&#8221; he found there. So what?  Leaving a tip is his option. It&rsquo;s at his discretion. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much money he has in his pocket (and that&rsquo;s none of her business anyway; she shouldn&rsquo;t even be commenting on that).  Tipping was intended for exceptional service. It should not be expected as a matter of course   &mdash;   even for mediocre food, slow service, and a lousy attitude. If she can&rsquo;t deal with that fact, she should get into another business. Obviously, there is something wrong with her attitude, right from the start; and probably it affects the rest of the way her restaurant is run. She thinks she has a right to what&rsquo;s in people&rsquo;s wallets.  And to notice and comment on it   &mdash;  - the nerve!</p>
<p>I say good for him!  I&rsquo;m on his side. He shouldn&rsquo;t be intimidated by what others expect of him. The tip his decision to make. How he spends his own money is nobody&rsquo;s business but his own. He paid the bill, didn&rsquo;t he?  And that&rsquo;s ALL he owes them. If they want more, they should include a specified service charge and get it out in the open, as is done in Europe. It&rsquo;s a much better system there. And no, the service there is not worse; it&rsquo;s probably better.  Of course, in Europe, if you get especially good service or request a special favor, you&rsquo;re free to leave more. I&rsquo;m willing to be quite generous when someone has gone out of their way&hellip; but not for bringing me a glass of water.</p>
<p>As for June&rsquo;s comment about those, ahem, &#8220;Canadians&#8221; who are &#8220;surly, demanding, unruly, messy, loud&#8221;&hellip; I admit I can sympathize with her, most definitely, but that&rsquo;s entirely another matter from ordinary tipping. Those people owe something extra for the nuisance they&rsquo;ve caused. I never, never make a mess, nor do I make any demands, but I don&rsquo;t normally tip (not much) except when its&rsquo; especially deserved.  However, knowing their expectations, I don&rsquo;t &#8220;stiff&#8221; them either. The fact is, I generally avoid places that expect tips. And so, they lose not only the tip but my patronage entirely. Is that really in their own interest?</p>

		<p>When I delivered pizza for a year after getting home from prison, the best tippers were enlisted Air Force Academy personnel (especially the guards on duty at the south gate on snowy nights - I always got great tips from them) and trailer park whites; people who knew what it was like to have to work a lousy-paying job for a living.</p>
<p>The worst tippers were - in no particular order - blacks with huge TV sets in their living rooms, rich whites with Mercedes and BMWs parked out front and corporate party orders (some of whom seemed to think that two dollars was appropriate for a $100 pizza order involving an eight-mile round-trip drive.)</p>

<i>I know this article is about blacks and tipping, but I work at a supermarket and black customers tend to be much more difficult to deal with and far more unappreciative of the service they recieve when compared with whites.

<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting point about saying &#8220;Thank you&#8221;.   I don&rsquo;t think blacks normally say  &#8220;thank you&#8221;&hellip; certainly not very often!   I can&rsquo;t remember hearing it.   Not even for a favor or special treatment. They seem to take it for granted, like I owed it to them anyway.   I suspect  that, within their culture, they consider it demeaning or degrading to express thanks. </p>
<p> I used to make it a practice to give Christmas gifts to my subordinates at work, but the blacks NEVER said thank you.  (They certainly didn&rsquo;t <i> refuse </i> the gift either!)   They just (practically) snatched the gift out of my hand and walked away with it, without a word of thanks &hellip;or even a grateful smile. It was only blacks, and Hispanics too, who did this. And it was consistent.   Eventually,  I wised up and stopped giving any more gifts. If they couldn&rsquo;t even be bothered to say &#8220;thank you&#8221;,  then I couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to give them presents!</p>
<p> <i>they&rsquo;re more likely than white customers to decide against items that they bring to the check-out. Sometimes they don&rsquo;t even bother handing what they don&rsquo;t want to the cashier;  they just leave in the magazine racks, including items that require refrigeration.</i> </p>
<p>I see that in the supermarket all the time!  Not to mention their kids nibbling on fruit, potato chips and cookies.</p>

		<p>  &#8220;ALSO! relative to working with take out pizza!  a recognized indicator of the safety of a neighborhood is indicated by where pizza delivery WILL NOT deliver. This is a better indicator than school quality.&#8221;   &mdash;    SKIP</p>
<p><br>
Ha!  That may well be true.  It may be an even better indicator than police statistics.  When I  used to work in a station house, prospective residents of the precinct would  call up to ask for the crime statistics and to get an opinion on the safety of the neighborhood.  (Of course, you had to be careful what you said.  Say the wrong thing to the wrong person, and you could be in deep hot water.)   Maybe they should have been calling a pizza shop instead to get a really objective, un-PC assessment of the neighborhood, free of any political bias.</p>

		<p> &#8220;Among my black, college educated and 70K plus co workers, it is not uncommon for funeral notices for [relatives] of employees to be posted. Frequently, these notices make requests for cash to cover burial expenses for the deceased!  The funeral homes serving these people will not take a check! &hellip; black funeral directors know their clientele, and granny is not going to the cemetery till the bill is paid in cash. Families frequently &ldquo;pass the hat&rdquo; to satisfy the bills before the hearse rolls.&#8221;<br>

<p>I think anyone who works with a lot of blacks can identify with this problem.  There are constant collections.  Collections, collections!   It gets really annoying. They come up with every conceivable excuse to take a connection for every conceivable reason.  And this is for people who are making just as much as you are!  They are always in need for money for emergencies and life&rsquo;s unhappy times.  (Don&rsquo;t they have savings for a rainy day?)  I really would like to work at a place that has a ban on collections.  Oh, but that might be considered &#8220;racist&#8221; since this seems to be a black thing.</p>

		<p>  &mdash;  Anonymous wrote&hellip;..  &#8220;Its not just tips at restaurants. Its every aspect of life.  I never see blacks donate blood.  I&rsquo;ve never seen blacks volunteer for charity organizations or environmental causes. They are known to be the least likely to donate organs or to adopt children. Blacks just don&rsquo;t have a charitable spirit or any sense of generousity. They don&rsquo;t do these types of things because there isn&rsquo;t anything in it for them.  Altruism is alien to blacks and their cultural outlook. This is true of blacks EVERYWHERE.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Interesting observation.   It&rsquo;s that  white sense of altruism  (or call it compassion)  that causes whites to give, pitch in, contribute.  I call it compassion because non-whites are not known for having any concern for animals either.  This altruistic instinct works very well among whites, in white societies, or even in societies where there are only a few non-whites   &mdash;    but not enough to be a drag.   But beyond a certain tipping point, it doesn&rsquo;t work well in  non-white or heavily mixed societies, because whites do all the giving while blacks do all the taking.   The whites cannot continue to carry an ever-increasing load.  At a certain point,  as white numbers diminish, such societies are bound to collapse into chaos, and then it becomes dog eat dog.  Thus, thoughtless altruism destroys itself.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The fact is, I generally avoid places that expect tips. And so, they lose not only the tip but my patronage entirely. Is that really in their own interest?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, ghw, it is in their interest to keep you out if you don&rsquo;t pay the waitstaff.  That increases staff anger and turnover.  That is the way it works in this country (though I do suspect restaurants will be moving to the European model, due to non-tipping blacks.)  And given how nasty and rude blacks are there is more incentive to keep them out.  They moan because they have found out restaurants will comp their meals if they do so&hellip;why would any restaurant want that?  It costs them money.  I urge all blacks who think they don&rsquo;t have to be decent human beings in restaurants to keep out.</p>

		<p>In Canada and most of Europe they automatically add a 15% gratuity to your restaurant bill. Most people round up the bill to the next dollar, too. This way the servers don&rsquo;t get stiffed&hellip;call it socialism if you want, but blacks would have to pay up like everyone else&hellip;</p>

		<p>re:GHW  &mdash;  &#8220;The tip his decision to make. How he spends his own money is nobody&rsquo;s business but his own. He paid the bill, didn&rsquo;t he? And that&rsquo;s ALL he owes them&#8221;</p>
<p>In the USA, no he owes a 15% tip unless the service was bad. It is the business of the waitstaff because that&rsquo;s how  they get paid.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never, never make a mess, nor do I make any demands, but I don&rsquo;t normally tip (not much) except when its&rsquo; especially deserved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, if you live in the USA, just about every restaurant runs on tips. Whether you agree with this or not is irrelevent, that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s done in the USA. If the server provided adequate service, then you should tip 15%. As far as Europe and Canada, I&rsquo;ve been there a lot and the prices plus tax often make a meal a bit more expensive than in the USA with tips. However, both systems ie.Europe vs USA have their advantages and disadvantages, ie. in Europe one still has to pay for lousy or surly service, not so in the USA,  but in the USA, good waitstaff can get stiffed, not so in Europe. I will say,most American severs prefer the tip system as they get more money than they would on salary.</p>

		<p>GHW you say that you don&rsquo;t tip much, but in all due respect, it&rsquo;s unfair to not pay the waitstaff(unless service is bad) just because you don&rsquo;t agree with the custom of tipping. </p>
