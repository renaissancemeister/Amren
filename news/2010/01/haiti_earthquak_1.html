			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Philip Sherwell and Patrick Sawer, London Telegraph, January 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As anger and fears of violence grew amid desperate shortages of food, water and medical supplies, bands of machete-wielding earthquake survivor yesterday roamed through the ruins of Port-au-Prince.</p>
<p>Sporadic violence, looting and gang-related gunfire broke out under sweltering Caribbean skies even as thousands of US forces awaited deployment from a newly-arrived aircraft carrier sitting in the waters off the city.</p>
<p>In chaotic scenes, United Nations food trucks were rushed by hungry people clamouring for handouts of nutritional biscuits and water purification tablets. Children and the elderly were pushed aside in the crush.</p>
<p>UN peacekeepers patrolling the capital said frustrations were rising and warned aid convoys to add security to guard against looting. Yet despite the tensions, survivors lined up patiently at other UN food and water distribution centres. A teenage boy working for the charity foundation of Wyclef Jean, the Haitian-born hip-hop superstar, was shot dead as he drove a truck-turned-hearse away from a cemetery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody wanted to carjack him,&#8221; said Mr Jean, who arrived in the city on Thursday and put his staff to work clearing bodies. &#8220;Two shots.&#8221;</p>
<p>In one particularly shocking incident, a looter was spotted hauling a corpse from a coffin at a city cemetery so that he could drive away with the wooden box. There were reports of armed gangs setting up roadblocks to demand money and essential supplies from passing lorries and the UN said that the poor security situation meant it could not reach outlying areas with aid operations.</p>
<p>In the Iron Market, one of the poorest neighbourhoods, teenage looters scuttled over the concrete debris and ignored piles of dead bodies on the street in their desperate bid to dig out supplies.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are hungry, thirsty. They are left on their own,&#8221; said Leon Meleste, an Adventist sporting a white &#8220;New York&#8221; baseball cap.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is increasingly dangerous. The police doesn&rsquo;t exist, people are doing what they want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Former US president Bill Clinton, the UN special envoy to Haiti, urged Americans not to be deterred from supporting the relief effort as his wife Hillary, the secretary of state, flew in to the country to discuss the aid operation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may see some things in the next seven or 10 days that don&rsquo;t just tug at your heart strings but upset you,&#8221; Mr Clinton said. &#8220;You may see a lot of very angry people, you may see some people looting, you may see some people doing and saying some things you don&rsquo;t like.&#8221;</p>
<p>US troops are due to be deployed this weekend to help the distribution of aid and quell the threat of violence. But for now the Haitian capital, a tense and insecure place at the best of times, has no effective police force.</p>
<p>And the security situation worsened when the collapse of Port-au-Prince&rsquo;s main prison left 4,000 convicts free to escape. A local policeman, standing near the jail, rifle at the ready said: &#8220;All the bandits of the city are now on the streets. They are robbing people. It is a big problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evelyne Buino, a young beautician, said: &#8220;Men suddenly appeared with machetes to steal money. This is just the beginning.&#8221; Harold Marzouka, a Haitian-American businessman, said: &#8220;If aid doesn&rsquo;t start pouring in at a significant level, there will be serious consequences on the streets. People are in the shocked and frightened stage. The next phase is survival.&#8221;</p>
<p>The shortage of water remains the gravest problem. People have been walking the streets carrying empty plastic bottles gathering water from broken pipes and gutters. The city&rsquo;s supplies dried up following the rupture of the municipal pipeline.</p>
<p>Even before Tuesday&rsquo;s earthquake, most Haitians depended on water from a huge underground natural reservoir delivered by truckers. But many of the drivers are now too scared to deliver supplies after a number of them were attacked as they drove into the city.</p>
<p>One significant piece of good news that a UN warehouse, though damaged in the quake, had not been looted, as initially reported  &mdash;  allowing aid workers to begin distributing the 6,000 tons of food supplies inside.</p>
<p>Oxfam had water supplies in Haiti left over from a 2008 storm and has managed to get some 2,000 and 5,000-litre tanks into the city. US military officials say helicopters are ferrying in water and other supplies from the USS Carl Vinson, while the US multinational Procter &amp; Gamble Co. is sending 3 million water-purifying packets along with cash donations for earthquake relief.</p>
<p>The structure of government and law and order all but disappeared in the days following the quake. But on the ground some Haitians were trying to fill the power vacuum and implement their own self-help operation, encouraged by the city&rsquo;s Radio Metropole, which urged residents: &#8220;Organise neighbourhood committees to avoid chaos and prevent people looting shops and houses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Milero Cedamou, the 33-year-old owner of a small water delivery company, twice drove his small tanker truck 10 miles outside Port-au-Prince, paying $25 for each fill-up before returning to a tent city where thousands of homeless people were living.</p>
<p>Mr Cedamou said: &#8220;This is a crisis of unspeakable magnitude, it&rsquo;s normal for every Haitian to help. This is not charity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jean Ponce, a 36-year-old mason, was among 200 people holding plastic buckets who clustered around the truck  &mdash;  adorned with the slogan &#8220;Wait for God&#8221; on its side  &mdash;  when it returned. He lost one of his children in the quake and said the bucketful he collected would be the first drinkable water his four surviving children tasted since the disaster struck. &#8220;This is nearly like a miracle,&#8221; Mr Ponce said.</p>
<p>The uncertain security situation has also taken a toll on efforts to provide desperately-needed medical care. At dusk on Friday, security advisors to a team of Belgian doctors and nurses told them to leave a field hospital where hundreds of critically-wounded Haitians were being treated after shots were heard nearby.</p>
<p>Clearly frustrated, the medics reluctantly packed their equipment as patients who had waited more than two days implored them not to abandon the tents. Several had suffered life-threatening head injuries and blood loss from roadside amputations conducted without anaesthetic to free them from collapsed buildings.</p>
<p>In a remarkable scene, Sanjay Gupta, CNN&rsquo;s chief medical correspondent and a practising surgeon, worked at the makeshift clinic through the night, turning his crew and the network&rsquo;s private security team into an emergency medical unit.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is striking to me as a physician is that patients who just had surgery, patients who are critically ill are essentially being left here, nobody to care for them,&#8221; Dr Gupta said. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve never been in a situation like this. This is quite ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gen Russel Honore, the retired US army commander who became a hero in New Orleans after leading the belated military relief operation following Hurricane Katrina, said the evacuation was unforgivable and urged greater co-operation between US forces and the UN.</p>
<p>He made comparisons with the chaos of Katrina when initial reports of rampant looting and snipers hampered the initial relief mission. But even there, he said, no medical staff walked away. &#8220;Search and rescue must trump security,&#8221; he said.<br/>

		<p>Haiti doesn&rsquo;t have running water?  Or village wells?  Most water in the country is delivered by truck?  That is insane!  Wells, pipes and aqueducts are not exactly high tech.  I wish we could just leave them to their own devices and just watch.<br/>

		<p>I am hesitant to say too much about this because it is a great tragedy.  But tragedies should not become justification for barbarism.</p>
<p>The thugs/gangs in Haiti are not committing violence because they are starving.  It amazes me how quickly the media justifies savagery, looting, chaos, and violence in the name of necesssity.  </p>
<p>I have read many books on fasting and nutrition and the normal  human body is more than capable of going several weeks without food.  You need water, but the typical human body can go without food for several weeks.  </p>
<p>Yet when we see a natural disaster like this, within hours the media will invariably talk about violence and looting breaking out by people starving for food.  </p>
<p>With so many nations, including the U.S., Canada and the European nations ready to help, a tiny nation like Haiti could be overwhelmed with supplies, food, water, and medical help.  Yet, it seems no matter how much aid is given, Haiti remains in a perpetual state of poverty, chaos, and violence.</p>
<p>Just yesterday I heard Vice President Biden talk about how we will continue to give aid to Haiti for the next several years, long after we help them rebuild from the earthquake.  Is he not aware that we have given aid before the earthquake.  Haiti is in perpetual need of aid.  </p>

<p>Haitians are dying in the streets by the thousands with no leadership from their government in sight. <br/>
Meanwhile, the president of Haiti is meeting with a voodoo witchdoctor.</p>
<p>Haiti must be Creole for Hell.</p>
<p>France now getting pissy over US &#8220;occupation&#8221; of Haiti:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/haiti/7020908/US-accused-of-occupying-Haiti-as-troops-flood-in.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/haiti/7020908/US-accused-of-occupying-Haiti-as-troops-flood-in.html</a></p>
<p>Note to France: we don&rsquo;t want or need freaking medieval Haiti. If we really wanted to occupy a desolate, scarred, hopeless, hellhole we&rsquo;d send troops into Detroit.</p>
<p> YOU created this mess 200 years ago. We&rsquo;ve been dealing with the public nuisance of your screwed up, third world, basket case colony ever since. Either get out of the way or you go in there and fix it yourself. </p>
<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;m sick of Haiti. I&rsquo;m sick of the kleptocratic Haitian government. I&rsquo;m sick of the hapless Haitian people who installed that government. I&rsquo;m sick of them constantly expecting America to fix their problems. And I&rsquo;m sick of them and their French enablers acting like ingrates when we try to help them. If that&rsquo;s the way they are gonna act, we should simply pull out and let them wallow in the huge pile of rubble, disease, and squalor that they have created for themselves.</p>

<p>The looting, barbarism and violence will no doubt be blamed by the left on the convicts who escaped from the collapsed prison, but, while 4,000 is certainly no small number, how many actually survived the collapse? Even if, say, half survived either death or being critically injured (doubtful, considering they were all cooped up in a large masonry structure) I would guess that the survivors were too badly injured to be responsible for much of the mayhem we read about in this article. But be sure to expect the MSM to blame most of the barbarism on the prison collapse.</p>

		<p>Is it my imagination, or do all those U.S. rescue teams working in Haiti fail at &#8220;looking like America&#8221;?  I do declare, everyone I have seen is white and male.  Where is the diversity in those volunteers rescuing Haitians?  So far, the only place I see non-Whites is in the overlords *sending* Whites to Haiti, including the head of USAID, Rajiv Shah (a former Bill Gates gofer), the Halfrican in the White House, and mulatoo from the islands, Eric Holder, who is busy passing out Temporary Protected Status amnesties for his racial brothers.</p>

		<p>This shortage of drinking water for these &#8216;angry&rsquo; africans is by no means confined to Haiti and has an underlying basic cause; the africans themselves. Lets suppose there are several large african cities which are well laid out and built (by Whites) and include all the civilised services such as piped drinking water and sewage systems but fail utterly within a decade of being taken over by an african &#8216;government&rsquo;. Not because of earthquakes, floods, a tsunami or thousands of wandering zombies, but simply that africans are totally incapable of running and maintaining absolutely anything at all, even when such services are handed over to them in perfect working order.<br/>

		<p>Just to point something out here:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not correct to say that Haitians have responded to this catastrophe by an increased level of violence. The flood of reports on violence in Haiti in the wake of the quake leave out one crucial point: This level of violence in Haiti is NORMAL! That&rsquo;s right, normal. This is simply the way Haiti is normally, a violent, mad, dangerous Hellhole. </p>
<p>The violence level in Haiti has actually *decreased* since the quake, so I guess we should give the Haitians credit for something. But the fact that this level of appalling violence is actually a pleasant change of pace from the normal quotidian status quo is shocking.</p>

		<p>It may sound cruel but why can&rsquo;t we just walk away from Haiti? The country was a hell hole before the quake and will be after many millions/billions of our tax dollars have been spent there since the quake. Worse than that how many thousands of these vodoo practicing perpetual poverty/criminal &#8220;refugees&#8221; will we end up with forever? The question no one wants to ask: what will happen when OUR economy hits rock bottom and our money is totally worthless? Are we seeing a preview of coming atractions in every minority dominated US city?</p>

		<p>Did anyone doubt that looting would break out?  What they hell could they be looting?  They didn&rsquo;t have anything to begin with.</p>
<p>These people are uncontrollable and when they don&rsquo;t get it when they want it, looting and rioting are their choices of response.  Doesn&rsquo;t matter that there are rotting bodies in the streets or that there could be 200,000 dead.  Look, as a person who grew up during the 1960&rsquo;s in Baltimore where rioting and looting broke out just after MLK was killed and having seen how blacks handle any major crisis (Hurricane Katrina comes to mind), this didn&rsquo;t come as any surprise nor was any surprise at how fast the looting started.</p>

The lack of a halfway decent IQ among most blacks allows their natural instinct to fully bloom in all its natural splendor when left to their own (lack of) devices.

<p>     A good observation. And i&rsquo;m wondering how much the hispanics in this country are going to contribute-in any way-toward the relief effort in Haiti?</p>

		<p>To understand Haiti, you should rent and watch the movie &#8220;Ghosts of Cite Soleil.&#8221; It is a documentary showing the complete dysfunction and low IQ of the Haitians.  You can order it from any of those &#8220;movies by mail&#8221; companies.</p>
<p>The movie shows how the neighborhoods are run by brutal gangs. The leaders of these gangs act like 12-year-olds   &mdash;   highly emotive, immediate gratification, style over substance, quick to violence, and lack of logic or control.  For example one &#8220;leader&#8221; goes back-and-forth from wanting to be a rap star to becoming a big politician.  All the while he sits with raw sewage flowing under his feet.  Notice that instead of actually solving a single simple health problem (digging trenches to carry away raw sewage), this &#8220;community-leader&#8221; continues to sit in his own feces for months, while fantasizing about becoming the &#8220;Big Man&#8221; of Haiti or a rap star.  He believes that everything bad that has happened to him is someone else&rsquo;s fault   &mdash;   no one in Haiti takes responsibility for bettering their society (except foreign aid organizations run by Whites).</p>

<p>That reminds me of an article I was reading the other day. It was speaking about how cruise ships and tourists no longer go there, and haven&rsquo;t for some years now.  (Interestingly, Bill &amp; Hillary Clinton spent their honeymoon there.)<br/>
It said that despite the appalling poverty that always existed in Haiti, there were actually  very few beggars   &mdash;  - because there was no one to beg from!</p>

		<p>Right now on CNN.com, which I no longer visit if not for laughs, there is an editorial entitled, &#8220;Why does Haiti suffer so much?&#8221;. Other, similar articles are occasionally published about Africa and, like a McDonald&rsquo;s meal, can be fun because of their sheer predictability.  </p>
<p>The CNN article doesn&rsquo;t dissappoint fans of the genre and stays true to form by not pinpointing any reason but mentioning racism as a cause.</p>

		<p>Which will come first?<br/>
A) Al Gore explaining how global warming causes earthquakes and only socialism can save us; or,<br/>
B) Rachel Madcow and Chris &#8220;Tingling Leg&#8221; Matthews explaining how millions were saved because Obama is better than George Bush; or,<br/>
C) CNN reporting that donations to Haiti are lower than the donations for the Asian Tsunami were because we&rsquo;re all racists; or,<br/>
D) I buy yet another crate of ammo and some more canned goods and thank God I live in a white Judeo-Christian enclave.</p>
<p>(Correct answer: &#8220;D&#8221;)</p>

<p>I did not post that comment, but I have seen it quoted in various articles. Here is one.<br/>

<p>Per your suggestion, I found the mail order DVD company I used had it available, so I sent it to the top of my queue.  I got it yesterday, watched it this evening.  (Instead of watching the Haiti beg-a-thon, how racist of me.)  And it&rsquo;s even more tragic than you say.  What jumped out at me is the relative lack of shame that adult women had for being topless, and how the white French woman &#8220;aid worker&#8221; was there for nothing more than multiple rendezvous with several Haitian men.  In spite of French (or the ebonicey version of it) being the native language, they knew plenty of English cuss words, and they love to use American hip hop star names as their pseudonyms, such as &#8220;2pac&#8221; or &#8220;50 cent.&#8221;  You really couldn&rsquo;t take sides in the battle between the &#8220;Rebels&#8221; and Aristide, because both sides are nothing more than dictatorial goons.  Notice how quickly the Cite Soleil gangs were ready to roll over and not resist the successful &#8220;rebels&#8221; once they took control, as long as the price was right.  And they were doggedly pro-Aristide even though he did nothing for them, as Cite Soleil (Sun City) was nothing more than a cruelly ironic name for a slum.  And yes, my opinion that Haiti is East St. Louis over half an island hasn&rsquo;t changed.  In fact, it&rsquo;s worse, because ESL has white Illinois and Federal government taxpayers to back them up.  Haiti is on its own, relatively speaking.</p>
<p>Why do Americans intervene there, 2004 or otherwise?  I can recall a Bismarck quote about the Balkans that I&rsquo;d like to repeat.</p>
<p>And the worst part about it is that one of the five gang bangers was taken into exile in Paris.  I feel sorry for Paris.</p>
