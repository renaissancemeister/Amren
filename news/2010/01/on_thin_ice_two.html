<h1>On Thin Ice: Two Russians Skate off the Reservation</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Felten, Wall Street Journal, January 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Russian figure-skaters Oksana Domnina and Maxim Shabalin, who have been favorites to win gold medals at next month&rsquo;s Vancouver Olympics, thought they had found an admirably multicultural theme for their ice-dancing routine  &mdash;  an homage to aboriginal peoples. In it, they leap and dance and spin to a hip-hoppy track of sampled didgeridoo sounds while wearing loincloths over bodysuits painted with pseudotribal designs.</p>
<p>They have now learned the hard way that the politics of multiculturalism are tricky: The pair were denounced last week by Australian Aboriginal activists who don&rsquo;t like outsiders dabbling in their traditions. Bev Manton, chairwoman of the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council, declared the skaters had co-opted &#8220;a foreign culture, and used [it] inappropriately.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the Aborigines&rsquo; complaint goes far beyond the assertion that the skaters&rsquo; routine is corny or crass. The more serious accusation here is that the Russians are infringing on the cultural property of Aborigines. &#8220;We see it as stealing Aboriginal culture,&#8221; said Sol Bellear, a member of the Aboriginal Land Council. &#8220;It is yet another example of the Aboriginal people of Australia being exploited.&#8221; Ms. Manton said the performance is &#8220;not acceptable to Aboriginal people&#8221; because it is &#8220;offensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Aboriginal activists met earlier this week to weigh their options and decided that the Russian ice-dancing routine &#8220;while offensive to Aboriginal people, is not illegal.&#8221; That&rsquo;s a relief  &mdash;  though we can expect the Russian pair to be treated as cultural criminals at the Olympics nonetheless. Which is a shame, because even as we celebrate the great multiplicity and variety of cultures in the world, there is a case to be made that we all share in them.</p>

		<p>These ice skaters usually do their routine with classical music playing in the background. It is appropriate when &#8220;white&#8221; music is played, but not &#8220;another&#8221; genre&rsquo; of music from another cultural domain?</p>
<p>There are aboriginal tribes in the wastes of Siberia. They have some sort of applicable &#8220;native music&#8221;? Use that instead.</p>

		<p>Non-Whites will hate White irrespective of what they do. Therefore I believe the best solution to the racist problem is to ignore them and to create as much distance between us and them as possible. Behave (if possible) as though they do not exist. I had purged myself of all non-White influences ages ago. I even stopped listening to music and watching movies I had liked. The only non-White cultures in which I show any interest at all are those of the Far East and maybe Native Americans.</p>

		<p>I found this complaint from those who have been around the sub-continent for about 50,000 years to have great merit.I think that our government needs to embrace the prevention of cultural assimilation by those who do not have the proper genome. Our young white people who embrace African-American Ghetto culture by using E-Bonics, woofing hand gestures,listening to and imitating rap music and it`s atavistic milieu, need to be arrested and charged with genocide. Whiting up such a valuable part of our ethos will end up destroying it.What an awful world that would be. No perp walks, no drive bys, no crack babies,no lower sat scores, fewer prisons and public defenders,no beaten and murdered white women who just tried to get along, a veritable Hell in the hood.<br>

		<p>Why, oh why would a pair of Russian skaters want to skate around and pay homage to Australian aborigine &#8220;culture&#8221;? Why don&rsquo;t they simply skate to Russian music like &#8216;Volga Boatmen&#8221;, &#8220;Nutcracker Ballet&#8221;, or &#8220;Dance of the Sabers&#8221;?</p>
<p>Trying to celebrate aborigine &#8220;culture&#8221;, would be like a Nigerian skating duo dancing to  Italian opera music and trying to celebrate Italian culture.</p>

		<p>What nonsense!  Some people are so prickly sensitive about their precious cultural achievements (pathetically skinpy as they are).  It seems the less &#8220;culture&#8221; they have, the more protectively they guard it. They can have it!  Who would want to &#8220;steal&#8221; dross?</p>
<p>Question: When a Chinese pianist performs a Tchaikovsky concerto, is that cultural theft?  If a Cuban ballerina dances a French ballet, or a New Zealander soprano (with Maori name) sings a German opera,  does that constitute theft?   This is all so childish and silly.</p>

		<p>The aborigines should be so lucky to have their cultural image so positively presented.In every Hollywood film that includes English characters we have been invariably depicted as sneaky, supercillious, tea-drinking snobs clad head to toe in tweed while living in a fog-bound Dickensian rookery and calling each other &#8220;bounders&#8221; and &#8220;cads&#8221;in between acts of villainy.Maybe Bev Manton would like to take on our case.</p>

		<p>How does one appropriate culture if that &#8220;culture&#8221; never existed? It seems that for thousands of years these aborigines did not progress along the lines of Europeans and East Asians, even when they could not cry that slavery was the evil that had held them back.  That leaves me to wonder what did hold them back.    </p>

<p>I feel exactly the same way.  Writing off minorities was a good decision for me.  Exposure to black culture in all its glory gave me post traumatic stress disorder and I would keep reliving the trauma in my mind until I just erased minorities, mainly blacks.  I realize my psyche was reliving the trauma because it was preparing me for the future of this happening again.  When I promised my psyche I would keep blacks as far away acquaintances and only interact with them in a perfunctory manner the symptoms went down.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t discuss racial issues with them anymore because when I used to in the past it was because I was honestly trying to help them by telling them that all they had to do was pull themselves up by the bootstraps.  I thought it was hopeful and bordering on the naive.  They hate to hear that because it diminishes their claims about racism being this all-encompassing monster that will allow them to make vicious demands.  </p>
<p>And it looks like Aborigines are following suit.  They were living in the paleolithic era when Europeans first arrived and were starving to death because they didn&rsquo;t have even the most basic means of catching sea life that surrounded them.  They live in government-donated houses that they turn to squalor before demanding and receiving new ones.  But they have the gall to become &#8220;agitators&#8221; and &#8220;activists&#8221; and condemn well-meaning (foolish, naive) whites in a typically self-righteous, never-fully-satisfied manner.  Not to mention the fact that they made the extremely hypocritical and deeply insulting decision to start calling themselves &#8220;black&#8221;.  Back when I gave a hoot about black uplift I would say to myself &#8220;this is exactly what black people need.  For the absolute moth-feeding basement dwellers of the human race with average IQs of 65, a mere 5 points above down syndrome, to co-opt and appropriate the race of black for themselves, further damaging our already understandly-soiled reputation.&#8221;  Now I don&rsquo;t care because black people are dead to me and they can all drown in failure.  I&rsquo;ve got my own money to make.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect you to make an exception for me because unlike most black people I consider you a free human being with innate rights including the right to associate with whomever you choose and the right to your personal opinions. My white friends know who they are.</p>
