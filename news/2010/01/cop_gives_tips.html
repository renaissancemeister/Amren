<h1><a href="http://newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/officers_givs_tips_on_driving_while_black/#cmt">Cop Gives Tips on &#8220;Driving While Black&#8221;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Zak Stone, New Haven Independent, January 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When NHPD officer Shafiq Abdussabur goes to make an arrest, he keeps at least two pairs of handcuffs in his squad car: one for the suspect and the other for the suspect&rsquo;s mom when she starts to &#8220;act up.&#8221;</p>
<p>If New Haveners follow the advice of <cite>Driving While Black: A Black Man&rsquo;s Guide to Law Enforcement in America</cite>  &mdash;  Abdussabur&rsquo;s newly released advice book on how to avoid unnecessary arrests  &mdash;  he will be able to leave the extra pairs of cuffs in the station.</p>
<p>One activist present at a book event Saturday argued that changes in behavior need to come from the cops&rsquo; end as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With chapters like &#8220;How to Survive the Common Motor Vehicle Arrest&#8221; and &#8220;Using Proper Etiquette When You are Speaking to the Police,&#8221; Abdussabur&rsquo;s book attempts to educate readers, young black men in particular, about their rights when they get pulled over by the police. The book provides a &#8220;fool-proof plan&#8221; for &#8220;emerging unscathed&#8221; from a routine motor vehicle violation, said the author.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When interacting with the police, &#8220;Be very, very polite,&#8221; Abdussabur insisted. He explained that when the cops pull someone over, a routine stop can quickly escalate into a serious conflict that terminates with an arrest or the use of force if the driver is uncooperative and mouths off. While racial profiling is a factor that stokes such conflicts, Abdussabur said, a driver&rsquo;s good attitude can go a long way, whether or not a cop is in the right.</p>
<p>He said that cops already know if they&rsquo;re going to give someone a ticket within the first 15 seconds of pulling that person over. Turn the music off, put the cigarette out, and don&rsquo;t do anything to &#8220;give the officer a reason to develop a profile about you,&#8221; Abdussabar advises.</p>
<p>Reading from his book&rsquo;s section &#8220;Ma! You Ain&rsquo;t Helping!  &mdash;  When Family Comes on the Scene &amp; Gets Locked Up Too,&#8221;  Abdussabur urged family members of a detained suspect to avoid arguing with the cops. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Bottom line; your mom is too late! But with all of the yelling and cursing at the police, she is right on time for an arrest,&#8221; Abdussabur read.</p>
<p>Fair [&#8220;activist: Barbara Fair, who offered Abdussabur feedback on the book&rsquo;s manuscript before it was published,] said in her experience, the source of the conflict is often the police, hassling he mothers of arrestees who are simply trying to find out what their sons did wrong.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fair said that many people in the Monterey neighborhood still feel &#8220;occupied by the cops,&#8221; despite the efforts of community-based policing. She said many neighbors think the police are corrupt. They still discuss the case of Billy White, the police lieutenant who received a three-year prison sentence for corruption charges in 2007. People tend to take this anger out on &#8220;all officers,&#8221; she said, which is &#8220;sad, because there are some really good officers out there,&#8221; like Abdussabur</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Abdussabur said the hopes to publish six more books  &mdash;  one every 18 months  &mdash;  on other urban themes, like gun violence and an analysis of community policing initiatives. He said that his next book will be &#8220;a handbook on raising urban males.&#8221; Abdussabur is the founder of the Omar Academy, an Islamic boarding school for boys, and CTRIBAT, an anti-violence youth empowerment organization.</p>

<p>The book is published by Wheatmark Book Publishers and sells for $16.95.<br/>

<p>What is common sense to whites needs to be spoken directly to blacks.</p>
<p>Will a book help? No. Blacks and their family members will still raise hell. Just as with the &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; movement, blacks will work to provoke a confrontation and then claim to be the victims.<br/>

<p>Cops are going to go where the crime is, simple as that.  Since there is a lot of crime in black communities, the cops will be there often.  If blacks did not commit crime at a relatively rapid pace, then they wouldn&rsquo;t be &#8220;occupied.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then again, I don&rsquo;t look at a squad car going down the street in my area in terms of the garrison.  I look at it as precluding an armed robbery against my person or burglary against my domicile.  But that&rsquo;s just little ole bigoted me, with my developed frontal lobe and all.</p>

		<p>I wonder who wrote the book that seems to tell all the young black folks to say things to the cops like &#8220;What the f*** you be stoppin&rsquo; me fo?&#8221; and things like that? This book seems to be getting wider circulation in the hood than this moslem&rsquo;s book is.</p>
<p>FWIW, I have never had a white guy do that to me on a traffic stop.</p>
<p>I have arrested families for interfering, though. I once had to fight a bunch of mexicans who tried to &#8220;rescue&#8221; their family member from a DWI arrest. It was New Year&rsquo;s Eve, and all the backup I had was a heavily armed wrecker driver. Gotta love it.</p>

		<p>Maybe his next book can be for whites, and the consequences of WALKING WHILE WHITE in black neighborhoods.  While blacks can get arrested and might have to spend the night in the slammer for as they say &#8220;driving while black&#8221;, whites sometimes have to pay a huge fine (robbery), or might even face the death penalty (murder) if they are caught WALKING WHILE WHITE, in the wrong neighborhood!</p>

<p>Blacks get everything backwards. A lot of liberals and conservatives too, believe it. What&rsquo;s most amazing is they often seem to have convinced themselves. There must be a way to attach a useful number to this mental defect.  </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s some advice, and i hope &#8220;BIG DADDY FROM CINCINNATTI&#8221; will let me know what he thinks.<br/>
I don&rsquo;t get pulled over often, but I have speeded too much lately, and the odds have caught me. <br/>
I&rsquo;been pulled over a few times in the last few years, but never ticketed, though I was definitely in the wrong. <br/>
I attribute my ticket-free existence to the following:<br/>
1) no points on my license. (in the past, I always went to traffic school to avoid the points).<br/>
2) I always keep my hands visible, usually turn on the cab light, put on my emergency blinkers, etc. I roll down my window, and put my hands on the wheel, and make eye contact with the officer.<br/>
3) I am apologetic and polite, but not too grovelling.<br/>
4) I always tell the officer when I am going to reach for my wallet or glove compartment, so as to enhance safety; I want them to know I&rsquo;m aware that they are in a dangerous situation. When they say &#8220;can I see your license and registration,&#8221; I always tell them what I&rsquo;m going to do, and ask their permission to make those moves.<br/>
They are polite and give me a just warning, and let me go home.<br/>
It has had the effect of making me much more aware of safe driving, and I&rsquo;m observing speed limits.<br/>

		<p>False Accusations of Using the &#8216;N&rsquo; Word<br/>
One aspect of police-race relationships that I have not seen discussed anywhere is blacks making false accusations of using the &#8216;N&rsquo; word.  This is based on my personal experience and hearing the same from other officers.  When in a group, one black will chime that the officer used the &#8216;N&rsquo; word.  The rest will join in that they also heard the same.  Next comes the threats to file a complaint or law suit.  If the officer in alone and there are five blacks, one would be forced into a position of believing the lone cop and saying the five blacks were all lying to clear the cop of the false accusation.  </p>

		<p>I agree with the intent of this book, but ghetto blacks will no doubt call this guy a &#8220;sell-out&#8221; because he&rsquo;s pro law enforcement. He&rsquo;s a Muslim so I am sure he&rsquo;s a black former Christian convert to Muslim. He&rsquo;s got a double whammy. He will be scorned by Muslims for following the laws created by infidels, and called an Uncle Tom by blacks for kowtowing to whites. That, in a nutshell is a battle nobody can win. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been caught in a couple of speed traps over the years, and I can assure everybody that my &#8220;white skin privilege&#8221; did not get me out of a ticket! One time I even had my mother with me and, needless to say, we were both deferential to the cop. Still got the ticket, but at least we were smart enough not to make matters any worse for ourselves.</p>

<p><br/>
Is it really necessary to publish a book telling us what most (sensible)  people already know by instinct?</p>
<p>When you are facing a person who has a gun, a badge, a nightstick, mace, a summons book, arrest powers,  and the authority to use them on you, it is simply wise to be  &#8220;very, very polite&#8221;   towards that person.  It&rsquo;s a case where being courteous and cooperative will pay off by getting you courteous treatment in return.</p>
<p>On the other hand, mouthing off, cursing, and questioning the cop&rsquo;s authority is very, very unwise.   It may earn you a bloodied head and a night in a jail cell, facing even more severe charges.  And justifiably so!   (You may disagree with the cop, but save your argument for the judge; you&rsquo;ll have a much better chance of winning there.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, how many ghetto families are going to buy a book for $16.95?   Most of them don&rsquo;t even read books anyway.  Not even for $4.95.   Who will buy this book?  Probably libraries and schools, as well as white liberals and social workers .  He&rsquo;ll make money from them&hellip;. but it WON&rsquo;T be read by the people who need it.</p>
<p>Btw, I love the comment from aey99, regarding the consequences of &#8220;WALKING WHILE WHITE&#8221;&hellip; which can be far more serious than a mere traffic ticket, possibly involving even the death penalty (in the form of murder).  So true!  Why are no  books written about this?<br/>

<p>Good points. But it doesn&rsquo;t even have to be in a so-called &#8220;black&#8221; neighborhood. I live in a city that&rsquo;s 95% white, and the minorities are basically living in high rise apartments in the neighborhood. At night, if a woman is walking with her Ipod on, she&rsquo;s asking for trouble from the &#8220;culturally diverse&#8221; crowd in the apartments. I have a baby and a wife at home. My wife likes to walk, and I tell her that I will go with her around the block. Also, I will have my pistol with me, too. It&rsquo;s sad but it&rsquo;s needed. </p>

		<p>Courtesy to the police?  Basic common sense!   </p>
<p>When I was about 19, now long ago,  I was stopped by the police while driving someone else&rsquo;s car (belonging to a friend) that I had borrowed without his knowledge or permission. I also had a bit to drink (a bit, tho not heavily).   To be honest (as I now realize in the wisdom of mature hindsight), I was in a very compromising situation:   I  was driving a car that was not mine,  I had no registration, I had exceeded  the speed limit, I had the scent of alcohol on my breath, and I did not even have a driver&rsquo;s  license!  They could have thrown the book at me.  </p>
<p>At least I knew better than to resist or lie. I knew when I was wrong.  I tried to be just as courteous and cooperative with them as I could be.  They reciprocated  in kind.   I answered  their questions honestly, admitted that I had a few drinks, that the car was borrowed, and that I had no license. I did not try to argue, lie,  or alibi.  I was truly apologetic and ashamed (not acting).  They didn&rsquo;t even check out my story&hellip;. obviously, they sensed that I was telling them the truth  (which I was) and they believed me.   In consequence, the officers treated me very leniently. They let me go with just a ticket and a warning to go straight home (which I did).  I was obliged to go to traffic court and pay a fine, and also to get a driver&rsquo;s license.  That&rsquo;s all.   It could have been much worse.  I don&rsquo;t ascribe this leniency to the fact that I was  &#8220;driving while white&#8221;  (which surely some black militants would try to claim) but to the fact that I was respectful and honest with the  police,  sincerely regretful,  and they in turn gave me a decent break.   </p>
<p>I learned my lesson, many years ago,  and have never repeated it since.   I would say they got the lesson across very effectively, and with minimum pain to both sides.</p>

If it&rsquo;s dark, the interior lights are on. As soon as the officer approaches, I politely inform him that I have a CCW and there is a weapon in the vehicle, what would he like me to do? Never had any problem. Never seen that on COPS. I like the Steven Seagal show. They pull over these 2 black guys and ask for permission to search the vehicle. Ask the driver 4 times if there were any weapons in the car. No, no, no, no. 10 seconds later the deputy pulls a loaded revolver from under the seat. Did he think it was so well hidden they weren&rsquo;t going to find it. Like Mark Fuhrman said,&#8221; First thing, anything out of a blacks&rsquo; mouth for the first five or six sentences is a lie. That is just right out. There has got to be a reason why he is going to tell you the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>You are OH, SO RIGHT!</p>
<p>Just act like you have some sense, and chances are everything will work out best. Maybe not perfect, but I guarantee you that being a jerk will NOT help you. </p>
<p>If you are caught dead to rights, you are caught. There is no need to get the officer warming up his ticket pen to cite you for extra things, which being a jerk will do. </p>
<p>If you are in a compromising situation, but one that could go either way, being polite and having some sense will go a long way towards a better outcome.</p>
<p>But colored folks typically do not heed any of this simple, sensible advice.</p>
