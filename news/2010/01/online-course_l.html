			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marc Parry, Chronicle of Higher Education, January 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Morgan State University, a historically black institution in Baltimore .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. objected to the UMUC [University of Maryland University College] effort because it would duplicate a similar program [in community-college administration] that Morgan State offers as a blend of face-to-face and online course work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} In the 1992 college-desegregation case United States v. Fordice, the U.S. Supreme Court said states should make an effort to prevent predominantly white institutions from setting up programs that compete with public black colleges. Another Maryland public institution competing with Morgan&rsquo;s program would violate the Fordice decision, says Marybeth Gasman, an expert on black colleges at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Morgan State is one of the few black colleges that offers a doctoral program for higher-education administrators. James E. Lyons Sr., Maryland&rsquo;s secretary of higher education, says he decided to restrict the University of Maryland University College degree to protect a unique program, not to assault online education.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve had people say to me, &#8216;Well, how in the world could you make a decision that denies a school the opportunity to serve its own state population?&rsquo;&#8221; he says. &#8220;But they&rsquo;re not looking at it in the historical context. This is a very profound higher-ed desegregation issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Online education appears to be a new arena for this fight. Mr. Lyons concedes that the conflict may carry national implications &#8220;to the extent that program duplication has historically been viewed as something that takes place between schools in close proximity,&#8221; not as competition with online programs. Similar situations could emerge in states like Mississippi or Texas, Ms. Gasman says.</p>
<p>That prospect worries some distance-education leaders, who see the online medium as a means of reaching an audience not served by classroom-based learning.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is more about historical institutional issues in Maryland, with roots in real or perceived racism at the core,&#8221; says Janet K. Poley, president of the American Distance Education Consortium. {snip}</p>
<p>Within Maryland, however, Chancellor William E. Kirwan, of the University System of Maryland, worries that the precedent may prevent the state from responding adequately to its need for work-force-related degrees, if future online programs could be considered duplicative. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For now, budding community-college leaders in Maryland who can&rsquo;t study at UMUC, or spend some time physically at Morgan State, are out of luck. {snip}<br/>

So, if you look at in historical context of desegration, you are ethically bound to agree that we, the afroovoodoos, now have the legal authority to tell whites what they can and can&rsquo;t do. The bottom rail is on top, and it will stay there.</p>

		<p>This is how to act as gatekeeper in creating ideological conformity.  You can be sure that if you enroll for a degree at Morgan, the historically black school, you will have to agree to its politically correct message in order to pass the classes and get your degree.</p>

		<p>One the one hand liberals say blacks are just as smart as anyone else but OTOH they decree that no one should be allowed to compete w/black-run colleges because the HBCUs will then go out of business. </p>

		<p>Once again, we must provide special protection against actual competition. HBCU&rsquo;s have their place, but they should be forced to offer value for the money. We can&rsquo;t have black students running off the the white man&rsquo;s university, that&rsquo;s not fair!</p>
<p>If you were to take this to its logical end, could the state of Maryland sue the University of South Dakota for setting up an online degree program? How about colleges in the DC area on the Virginia side of the border? What about colleges like Devry, Phoenix, Webster, and (state) Wesleyan Universities? I&rsquo;m curious to see what would happen if you had a case in 2013 called Morgan state vs. Univ of Phoenix. Would the telecommunications providers have to blank out access to Univ of Phoenix for their subscribers in Maryland? Could you take this case nation wide? How would Morgan State impact Boise State? Would we get another &#8220;25 year&#8221; ruling like that idiocy that Justice O&rsquo;Connor wrote some years ago? This should be interesting.</p>
