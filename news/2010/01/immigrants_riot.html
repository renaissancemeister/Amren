<h1><a href="https://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LDE60716O.htm">Immigrants Riot in Italy Amid Racial Unrest</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ilario Filippone, Reuters, January 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thousands of immigrants protested against racism in a southern Italian town on Friday, after a night of rioting sparked by an attack on African farm workers by a gang of white youths.</p>
<p>In one of Italy&rsquo;s worst episodes of racial unrest in years, dozens of Africans in Rosarno, in the Calabria region, smashed car windows with steel bars and stones and set cars and rubbish bins on fire late into Thursday night.</p>
<p>Police said at least one car was attacked while passengers were inside  &mdash;  several of whom were injured.</p>
<p>The immigrants, who also blocked a road, clashed with police in riot gear. Police said 7 immigrants were arrested. Thirty-two people, including 18 policemen, were injured.</p>
<p>The incidents took place after white youths in a car fired air rifles at a group of African immigrants returning from work on farms, injuring two of them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Friday morning some 2,000 immigrants demonstrated in front of the town hall to protest against what they said was racist treatment by many locals. Some shouted &#8220;we are not animals&#8221; and carried signs reading &#8220;Italians here are racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>Scattered acts of vandalism by immigrants continued on Friday morning as some smashed store windows. Police said that in two separate incidents Rosarno residents had tried to run over immigrants with their cars.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>SQUALID SLUMS</p>
<p>Maroni [Interior Minister Roberto Maroni], from the far-right Northern League party that is a junior partner in Silvio Berlusconi&rsquo;s government, sparked controversy when he said one of the reasons for the violence was that illegal immigration had been &#8220;tolerated all these years&#8221;.</p>
<p>Opposition leader Pierluigi Bersani and several centre-left politicians accused Maroni of fuelling the tensions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maroni is passing the buck .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we have to go to the roots of the problem: Mafia, exploitation, xenophobia and racism,&#8221; Bersani said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Italy has taken a hard line against illegal immigration and has moved to stem a tide of immigrants who board boats in Africa to try to reach its southern shores. Some boats have been turned back on the open seas.<br>

		<p>Just to clarify, the Italian news media is saying that the African laborers were shot with birdshot, not air rifles, sustaining non-life-threatening injuries to the legs. They interviewed a group of refreshingly candid Italian men from Rosarno, who said that they were &#8220;armed to the teeth&#8221; in order to defend their homes against marauding Africans. An incongruously well-dressed young Arab showed TV cameras the squalid conditions the immigrants live in before kicking over a bucket with his new sneakers in staged fury and lamenting their conditions. Several times in the report the black African immigrants spoke about moving elsewhere, though for some reason not one of them said they intended to move back home, away from racist Italians.</p>

		<p>Go to any White nation if you are nonwhite and yell racist and demonstrate and presto! you are in along with all your kin. The freebies will flow like Niagra Falls. </p>
<p>Why hasn&rsquo;t the White race worldwide awaken to this scam yet? Are they really that dumb and dumber? They haven&rsquo;t had enough bad experiences yet to KNOW that different races in a nation mix as well as oil and water. And they call the White race &#8220;intelligent&#8221; with a higher IQ than most of those flooding their lands? HA!</p>

<p>If it isn&rsquo;t the AP it is Reuters, making up excuses for black crime and violence.  I seriously doubt there was any such incident, involving an air rifle.  If there was, I&rsquo;m pretty certain it had nothing to do with the riots.  I mean, are these people really so dumb they&rsquo;re going to go berserk and destroy everything in sight, because a couple of them were stung by bb&rsquo;s?<br>
I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how down and out I became I have more pride than to stay in a country whose people don&rsquo;t want me and who are vastly different.  But these rabble not only have no pride they have no impulse control either&hellip;nor skills&hellip;.nor intelligence&hellip;.nor anything worthwhile, yet they have kids galore, knowing full-well beforehand that they can&rsquo;t feed them.  </p>
<p>But, don&rsquo;t worry, by the time the multicults are finished, the causes for the crime and violence will be determined to be not enough freebies, too much white &#8220;intolerance&#8221; or other bogus reasons&hellip;. except the real one&hellip;&hellip; and that is natives in any country don&rsquo;t like foreigners who commit numerous crimes and have disgusting practices, such as cruelty to animals and  forcing their way into their cities and towns.</p>
<p>According to one chief analyst that makes all the t.v. news shows, 2010 will mark the beginning&hellip;worldwide&hellip;.of a severe backlash on immigrants.  He named the tea party people as becoming &#8220;focused&#8221; on illegal immigration and said that if amnesty passes, the backlash will be a magnitude of outrage  equivalent to a super earthquake. </p>

		<p>This incident demonstrates the hyper-racial solidarity of blacks.  Notice how a couple of blacks were allegedly shot by a small group of Italian teenagers and every black in the area acts as if the Italian people as a whole have declared war on them.  If Italians rioted everytime one of their own was raped or murdered by a non-white immigrant there would be riots on a daily basis.  <br>
Blacks can dish it out but they can&rsquo;t take it.  They rape, murder, and rob whites with impunity.  But, the slightest transgression against a black by a white person, and they act as if it is the crime of the century.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t like anyone being shot or ridiculed.I don&rsquo;t know if these Africans were invited either. I do however think it is natural as breathing to see the writing on the wall when a large group men of a foreign race come to your small villages for work! Are the native men not supposed to see their jobs being taken by people willing to work cheaper for a while&hellip;? Are the native men not supposed to realize that these foreign men will  be eyeing their sisters and daughters with obvious intentions to be fulfilled? The bottem line is &#8220;You can castrate some of the men some of the time,&hellip;. but you cannot castrate all of the men all of the time&#8221; Fortunately&hellip; the Italians here have not been castrated in mind or body!!!!! When men lose the instinct to preserve what they hold dear&hellip; why even call them men?</p>

		<p>Italy is a relative new-comer to the game of mass third world immigration.It is decades behind the catastrophic path that Britain and France (both scheduled to be majority non-White by mid-century) have taken.<br>
One would have thought the unfolding tragedy happening in its big neighbor to the north would have been ample warning enough - but I forget, one must never undestimate the stupidity of the Left, particularly the Italian Left.</p>

		<p>Whites around the world need to realize that while there&rsquo;s money to be made by exploiting cheap non-white labor, the ultimate cost to white civilization overall far exceeds the benefits gained by a few individuals. </p>
<p>In white countries, employing cheap non-white illegal immigrant labor needs to made a serious offense and strictly enforced. </p>

		<p>He has no problem at all blaming &#8216;the mafia&rsquo; yet he actively brings in a group that will be much worse than the mafia with their use of tactics, treachery and secrecy. Perhaps in Italy it will be different, though. They&rsquo;re used to fighting the mafia. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;The attack set off a night of rioting by dozens of Africans, who smashed car windows with steel bars and stones and set cars and rubbish bins on fire.&rdquo; (From the full article.)</p>
<p>In the process of this typical &ldquo;spontaneous&rdquo; black expression of &ldquo;self-determination,&rdquo; 37 people were injured including 18 police officers, so states the same article. From this extravaganza of violence, these Africans have the unmitigated gall to march around with signs stating: &ldquo;We are not animals&rdquo; and of course, &ldquo;Italians here are racist&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Well, is there some special video tape or DVD that they all watch, before they leave Africa for Europe, that details exactly how to &ldquo;behave&rdquo; when they don&rsquo;t get their way? I would guess that if there is one, the UN passes it out along with all the other &ldquo;aid&rdquo; they give these downtrodden &ldquo;unfortunates.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In the end, the Italians are doing exactly what any abused and exploited majority population should do when faced with unwelcome colonists; they are driving them out. It makes no difference if Reds and other belligerently dewy-eyed traitors call them &ldquo;immigrants,&rdquo; they remain invading colonists. Much like the Italian settlers were driven from Libya and Ethiopia in the past, so too these Africans must face the unpleasant process of decolonization now.</p>
<p>After all, are we not always told that we have so much to learn from these enriching Third World wonders? Certainly, following their process of combating unwanted colonization is on the top of the list; haven&rsquo;t we been told that this was one of their crowning glories, following World War II for the last 75 years?</p>
<p>Hey, live and learn!</p>

		<p>The only way to save Europe is via Eastern Europe   &mdash;   Western Europe is lost. Eastern Europe has thus far been insulated from immigration, etc. Plus, those nations are still pretty traditional (and the oppression they experienced under communism gives them greater insight and understanding). But they are on the verge of being sucked into the same environment, especially as they begin to enter the EU. Efforts should be made to preserve Eastern Europe before it is too late. </p>

Most whites don&rsquo;t like blacks, not necessarily because they are different-looking than us, but we are tired of them forcing their way into our countries, cities, our government, our businesses, all while calling us racists, stealing from us, killing us, or raping our women.  Leave us alone and your people will not be hated!</p>

<p>The root of the problem is allowing a large number of non-natives to live in the country.  Without that, there could be no xenophobia or racism, both of which are problems for the newcomers, not the native population.  And just who is being exploited here?  The only real problem of the four is the mafia.</p>

		<p>My parents are from this region of Italy. It is quite poor and the unemployment rate is 3-4 times that of the North. You may be wondering why a region with such high unemployment would need migrant workers, and the main reason is that the socialist government has destroyed the willingness for people to work, and they have become dependent on the state ( remember, these are the same people who left to the US and Germany to work hard, before there was a welfare state). The majority of government spending goes to the south, even though the population is much smaller.  Socialism really is the cause of the decline of the west.  Without it, only a few would be brave enough to go to another country to work hard, not the millions of invaders we have now who just want a &#8220;better life&#8221; (because they destroyed their own country).</p>
<p>But Italy is lucky that the people are more racially conscience and they have a distinct culture, and a different language, and I hope this incident sends a message to others who were thinking about following.</p>

I strongly agree that Eastern Europe should be &#8220;saved&#8221;.  But my agreement ends THERE.</p>
<p>I emphatically DON&rsquo;T agree that Western Europe is lost and should be abandoned.  Shame on any defeatists among us who recommend giving up!  People who urge us to lie down and die passively are NO HELP to us at all.  Only a traitor would make such a suggestion.</p>
<p>And by the way, doesn&rsquo;t the above deluded person realize that once Western Europe is lost, Eastern Europe will soon follow?</p>

		<p>When are white people around the world finally going to say &#8220;enough is enough?&#8221; Why is it that whites in Europe are so scared of being morally lectured on the horrors of racism and discrimination against blacks and other non-whites in Italy? The way I see it, blacks and other non-whites have no business being in Italy. They are no more Italian than whites in Africa are African. To all those critical race theorists who insist that one&rsquo;s background has nothing to do with physical appearance and everything with language and culture, answer me this: Could a Pakistani woman in the United Kingdom play Queen Elizabeth in a film? Could Nigerians in Ireland star as Irish revolutionaries? I think the answer is a resounding no. </p>
<p>By the way, did any of you catch the political roundtable in Britain that featured leaders of the numerous parties? If so, then I hope you were as incensed as I was when Bonnie Greer told Nick Griffin that white British people like him weren&rsquo;t true natives. That a black American woman in Britain has the nerve to tell Nick Griffin he isn&rsquo;t native to the United Kingdom is truly revolting. As Mr. Griffin pointed out, nobody would approach a Navajo Indian in the United States or a Maori in New Zealand and have the audacity to tell them they aren&rsquo;t natives of the land. </p>
<p>I guess only white people aren&rsquo;t allowed to be natives to any country. We&rsquo;re the only ones who aren&rsquo;t allowed to have nations to ourselves. I know that certain anti-racists will insist that racial diversity is a consequence of colonialism and imperialism. To hear them tell it, had whites just stayed in Europe and kept to themselves, they wouldn&rsquo;t have all these headaches. Well, that doesn&rsquo;t exactly explain why Ireland and Scandinavian countries are now experiencing a decent influx of non-white immigrants. Those nations certainly didn&rsquo;t have colonies in Africa or Asia. </p>
<p>The multiracial madness we currently face is a result of an unwillingness to assert our collective racial consciousness and the unwillingness of white families to have more kids. Dr. Francis once said that if whites got together and decided they wanted to fix racial problems, they could solve racial problems tomorrow. We have the power to save our people. The vast majority of whites simply lack the backbone. They regard people here at American Renaissance as dumb and deluded. I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to let them learn the hard way!</p>
