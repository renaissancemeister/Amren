<h1>&#8216;Red-Neck Republicans&rsquo; Out to Get Them, New Black Panther Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ryan J. Reilly, Main Justice, January 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New Black Panther Party president Malik Zulu Shabazz hasn&rsquo;t said much publicly about the Obama Justice Department&rsquo;s dismissal last May of voter intimidation charges against his black power group, a decision that sparked conservative protests.</p>
<p>But last week in a podcast interview, Shabazz let loose  &mdash;  with a racially tinged rant against the Republicans he said are trying to turn the issue into campaign ads for this fall&rsquo;s midterm elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;These right-wing white, red-faced, red-neck Republicans are attacking the hell out of the New Black Panther Party, and we&rsquo;re organizing now to fight back,&#8221; Shabazz told the podcast host, a man who calls himself &#8220;Brother Gary&#8221; and hosts a show called Conscious Chats on Blogtalk Radio.</p>
<p>Shabazz singled out GOP Reps. Frank Wolf (Va.) and Lamar Smith (Texas)  &mdash;  two critics on the House Judiciary Committee  &mdash;  along with &#8220;Old Uncle Tom, Michael Steele, the black Negro who heads the Republican National Committee.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the podcast interview, Shabazz said that Republicans are trying to make it look as if the Obama administration and Attorney General Eric Holder were favoring the New Black Panther Party.</p>
<p>&#8220;People know that&rsquo;s crazy as hell, they don&rsquo;t owe us no favors,&#8221; said Shabazz. &#8220;If the Obama people thought we were their political allies, they would run in the other direction because we don&rsquo;t give them no political help.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the members of the party in Philadelphia, he added, &#8220;just happened to be a little too black or too strong&#8221; and &#8220;made a mistake&#8221; by bringing a weapon to the polls.</p>

<p>They knew exactly what they were doing only they DID make one mistake; bringing weapons.</p>
<p>They got a bit too cocky and premature. The guns will come later.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Democrat-controlled House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday rejected by a 15-14 vote a resolution of inquiry that would have forced the Justice Department to tell Congress why it dismissed a civil complaint against members of the New Black Panther Party who disrupted a Philadelphia polling place in the November 2008 election.&#8221;</p>

 Shabazz shoots off his mouth with racial epithets just like the so-called, &#8220;rednecks&#8221; he criticises. Same behavior, but different race.</p>
<p>He is an excellent example of the term &#8220;black redneck&#8221;.</p>

<p>Bringing a weapon to a polling station isn&rsquo;t a &#8220;mistake&#8221;. It&rsquo;s voter intimidation which is a federal crime. But I agree that the Obama administration probably isn&rsquo;t pro Black Panther. They just didn&rsquo;t want to draw attention to the Black Panther&rsquo;s voter intimidation tactics because it draws attention to their own ACORN voter shananigans.</p>

<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a little bit of a mistake to bring a weapon to a voting poll and then threaten all those &#8216;racist crackers&rsquo; that a &#8216;black man will control them&rsquo;</p>

		<p>These &#8220;NEW&#8221; Black Panthers are NOT a whole lot differenet than the &#8220;OLD&#8221; Black Panthers. In my observation just a bunch of grown ups, so called, trying to play &#8220;drum and bugle corps&#8221; for those beyond the teen years. The love of the fancy uniforms, the marching, the chanting, the whole atmosphere smacks of drum and bugle corps for adults.</p>
<p>Portray a bad image but underneath NOT really that. Like the intimidation but if their bluff called found to be wanting.</p>
<p>I am not impressed.</p>

		<p>Are these NBP guys gonna award each other medals for various (and nefarious) deeds? Along with their &#8220;uniforms&#8221; I&rsquo;m sure they all want to look like a South of the border general or an African &#8220;head of state&#8221; with all the medals on the breast.</p>

<p>They have everything handed and given to them on a silver platter&hellip;.NOW, they want to &#8216;take&rsquo; it&hellip;</p>
<p>THIS TIME they will face off with people that WILL fight back instead of a 135 lb. innocent lone White man&hellip;.and they will do what they always have in the past and present..run like hell&hellip;.</p>
<p>I cannot wait for them to try&hellip;..</p>

		<p>The irony is that the Republican Party cares as little about White interests as the Democrats and is possibly even more destructive (ie the 1986 Reagan amnesty, Bush II&rsquo;s strenuous attempts to push another &#8216;amnesty&rsquo; through).The only difference being the Democrats are open and honest about their intentions.</p>

		<p>Help is on the way. On March 2, 2010, SCOTUS will hear arguments in the case, McDonald v. Chicago, which is challenging Chicago&rsquo;s handgun ban. If, as expected, SCOTUS applies the Second Amendment to the cities and states, then urban dwellers will escalate the purchase of firearms. Then, the likes of Shabazz can be confronted. </p>
<p>Remember, a SCOTUS ruling applies to all 50 states, so cities that have gun-control laws will be targeted. New York City&rsquo;s Sullivan Act will be invalidated by the McDonald opinion.</p>

		<p>New or old the panthers are militants, not black rednecks.  They are goons and thugs, were then, are now.  They are just the type of people your &#8220;government&#8221; will cater too.  </p>
<p>I have come to understand that some people don&rsquo;t belong in a civilized society governed by laws; some people have no concept of courtesy, civil order, and fairness.  I have also come to understand that our government promotes these types of people at the expense of the orderly and civilized.</p>
<p>Either fight or flee.  So far the fleeing has been the order of the day for the past fifty years.  </p>

		<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if Malik Zulu Shabazz was actually Jervarious Quantrell Sheats or something similar. If a white had said the same thing in reverse, it would have rivaled the Haiti earthquake as a top main stream media story.  The very idea of organization such as a &#8216;White Panther Party&#8221; power group would give Jesse and Al a stroke.</p>

<p>That wasn&rsquo;t just a mistake: that was a crime, to intimidate people with a weapon, like that, at a voting poll.</p>

<p>&hellip;and it&rsquo;s a &#8220;podcast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet if I   &mdash;   or any other White   &mdash;   were to say:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;These left-wing black, black-faced, black-neck Democrats are attacking the hell out of the White Nationalist movement, and we&rsquo;re organizing now to fight back.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&hellip;it&rsquo;d be Racist Hate Speech and Conspiracy to Violate Civil Rights, and would involve immediate arrests.  </p>
<p>Double standards?  Oh no, Big Brother, I don&rsquo;t see any double standards.  I don&rsquo;t want <i>anybody</i> to ever call me a nasty Racist.<br>

		<p>We need to have the Panthers at our February meeting.They are our kind of minority. Armed and wanting to be seperate and left alone from white liberal dogooders and head busting cops.Shbazz razzmatazz says the same things we do about race mixing and democrat panderings. Bring them on board along with our friends in the Black Muslim movement. Whatever makes us seperate makes us strong.<br>
