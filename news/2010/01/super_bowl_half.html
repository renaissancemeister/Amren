<h1><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=jackson/100126">Super Bowl Halftime Needs Hip-Hop</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scoop Jackson, ESPN, January 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When is a hip-hop group going to get a shot at performing a Super Bowl halftime show?</p>
<p>Ever since the infamous &#8220;wardrobe malfunction,&#8221; the NFL has been more conservative than Ann Coulter in selecting who&rsquo;s going to entertain us between the halves. At this point it seems to be getting personal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about an act that would cause the same reaction people had when Three 6 Mafia won the Academy Award for best song. But until that tupocalyptic day arrives, here are some acts that the Super Bowl halftime selection committee should take into strong consideration .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sorta, really.</p>
<p>* The Ying Yang Twins: They can open up with an all-out ATL collabo (featuring Lil Jon, of course) version of &#8220;Salt Shaker,&#8221; followed by a 10-minute version of &#8220;The Whisper Song&#8221; (with David Banner making a guest appearance) and then finish the set with a remix of the anthem &#8220;Halftime (Stand Up and Get Crunk).&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* DJ Khaled: All he has to do is use his Def Jam South president status and bring any of the artists that he gets on his mix tapes (Akon, Usher, Rick Ross, T-Pain, Young Jeezy, Plies, Lil Wayne, et al) and do one song: &#8220;I&rsquo;m So Hood.&#8221; SB halftimes will never be the same.</p>
<p>* Run-DMC, Whodini, A Tribe Called Quest, EPMD, Salt-N-Pepa, De La Soul and Doug E. Fresh with Slick Rick: Hey, if Tom Petty got a shot then this should be no problem. The old school needs love, too.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>o Del Tha Funkee Homosapien: Because nothing gets a crowd more wild than hearing &#8220;Mistadobalina.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* OutKast: In this order: &#8220;B.O.B.,&#8221; &#8220;Da Art of Storytellin&rsquo; (Part 1),&#8221; &#8220;Ms. Jackson,&#8221; &#8220;So Fresh, So Clean,&#8221; &#8220;The Way You Move,&#8221; &#8220;Elevators (Me &amp; You),&#8221; and end with &#8220;Hey Ya!&#8221; Done.</p>
<p>* Jay-Z: Has the catalog, has the cachet, has the name, has the wife, has the connects, has the swag, has the résumé. If Hov doesn&rsquo;t eventually get the gig, then no one ever will.<br>

		<p>Ever since the wardrobe malfunction, every subsequent act has had a proven track record of not just longevity, but of being trusted to handle any surprises while performing live.<br>
Paul McCartney, Rolling Stones, Prince, Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, and coming up: the Who.</p>
<p>I would imagine Eric Clapton, Aerosmith, Pat Benatar, and Madonna are due soon. </p>
<p>Scoop&rsquo;s list are of people who may very well be forgotten pretty soon. If a black act is needed, it would have to be someone like Kool and the Gang, or LL Cool J. </p>

		<p>Hip-hop isn&rsquo;t even music; it&rsquo;s spoken words set to a pulse.  It is the &#8220;music&#8221; of the lower classes and the tone-deaf.  The vast majority of Americans don&rsquo;t want to hear this; if it was on as a halftime show at the Superbowl, 95% of Americans would be going on a store run for more chips and dip and beer during that time.  At least Janet Jackson was entertaining!  This stuff is only promoted because whites and other non-blacks are afraid of getting called racist if they don&rsquo;t promote it.  Blacks need to remember that they are NOT a majority in this country; they comprise about 17% of the population (and that&rsquo;s a generous estimate) - so why should their lower-class musicians get any play at all on the Super Bowl?</p>

		<p>Perhaps a performance of &#8220;Cop Killer&#8221; by &#8220;Ice-T&#8221; would fit the bill.  It would be timely, considering this past year&rsquo;s spike in the shooting death of police officers.  </p>
<p>A theatrical re-enactment of several of these cases would undoubtedly grab the attention of the sports fans like no other half-time show in memory.  </p>

<p>I think 17% is a FAR to low percentile guess of the black population in the U.S. A visit to any American city would confirm my guess that the blacks are more like 40% and higher in most big cities. This constantly quoted figure, I believe, is to mislead the White American populace about the true figure of blacks here.</p>

		<p>Actually, I have no problem with this - the league is mostly black anyway, and for the life of me I cannot understand why whites still bother with these leagues of glorified felons and thugs anyway. </p>

		<p>Skip no. 4 - in big cities you are right, lots more blacks there than whites (check Detroit and Chicago&hellip; Gary, IN) - but in the &#8216;burbs, not so.  You have pockets of them in certain areas, such as in North Pomona in Southern CA, or North Long Beach, ditto, but in the suburbs, the mountains, and in all more rural areas the whites far outnumber tha blacks.  Overall, I believe the 17% figure is right around what it actually is.  However, I would never suggest to ANY white person to pay a visit to any large inner city&hellip;. not without a backup Hummer full of armed Marines&hellip;.</p>
