			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Schorr, NPR, January 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} But it is important, as reconstruction work begins, that the United States and the family of nations agree on some central authority to supervise what may be the creation of a new state.</p>
<p>Obama speaks of &#8220;a path to a brighter future.&#8221; Under the stopgap arrangement in effect since the earthquake, the United States and the United Nations handle much of the flow of aid in cooperation with the Haitian government, they say. But President Rene Preval&rsquo;s government, for all practical purposes, does not exist. It lies in ruins in the rubble of the presidential palace and other government buildings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I am thinking of the mandate system introduced by the League of Nations after World War I and the trusteeship system of the United Nations after World War II.</p>
<p>Trusteeship, which officially ended in 1994, was a way of guiding countries toward autonomy with shadow governments reporting to the U.N. Trusteeship Council. Among the territories that experienced some version of trusteeship are Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor and Cambodia.</p>
<p>The United States will undoubtedly bear much of the burden of &#8220;building back better,&#8221; as former President Clinton, the U.N.&rsquo;s special envoy to Haiti, puts it. But it would be well if America did it under an international supervision.</p>

		<p>A case of the blind leading the blind. The UN needs to come under<br>
trusteeship itself. That being said, the UN will avoid having anything at all to do with Haiti, knowing it would be a thankless and hopeless job for which they will forever be blamed for the guaranteed disasters that will befall Haiti. The definition of a &#8220;boat&#8221; is a hole in the water into which you throw money. Haiti is a hole in the Caribbean.</p>

		<p>Even before the earthquake, 50% of Haiti&rsquo;s Gross National &#8220;Product&#8221;  came from foreign aid. </p>
<p>The future is clear: we will shovel in more and more aid, the population will go up and up, lather, rinse, repeat. </p>
<p>If we stop sending aid, they will invade in a &#8220;Camp of the Saints&#8221; type scenario.<br>

		<p>Actually what is true of Haiti is true anywhere of blacks. And the more blacks a country (or city, witness Detroit) has, the more true it is. Haiti is the most culturally and demographically black African country in the western hemisphere. It is also the poorest and most backward country in the western hemisphere. But here&rsquo;s the kicker. Haiti isn&rsquo;t that bad off by African standards. There are twenty-two countries in Africa south of the Sahara that are poorer then it. </p>

		<p>Why exactly is this?</p>
<p>Who are we, exactly, to tell the haitians how to live their lives?  To force them to live the way we want them?</p>
<p>That is neither moral nor within our self-interests.  Keeping the haitians in their own country&hellip;THAT is both moral and within our self-interests.</p>
<p>Seriously, the entire issue with blacks boils down to one thing.  It was (and is) a serious mistake to bring blacks into our world and insist they live like us.</p>
<p>What is going on in haiti?  It&rsquo;s their society attempting to shed itself of white civilization and return to the way this genetic lineage has lived their lives for hundreds of thousands of years before they came into contact with us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cruel, pointless, and quite frankly impossible, to interfere with that.  It&rsquo;s also self-destructive on our part.</p>

		<p>For any new readers to AmRen, please allow me to repeat the facts that our Nation continues to hide:  </p>
<p>Psychologists (psychometricians) have proven beyond any shadow of a doubt that the average African IQ is very low.  Low IQ people cannot earn good incomes and they make poor choices. The aggregate result is an inability to create safe, stable, healthy, &amp; wealthy societies.  This is demonstrated in virtually every country, city, or neighborhood inhabited by Blacks, which are, almost without exception absolute disasters.  </p>
<p>The bottom line is that there is nothing we can really do for Africans. No amount of foreign aid or training programs will make a lasting impact, because each generation starts again at relatively low IQ.  </p>
<p>Our desire to feed them, only allows massive population growth, which just delays the inevitable. Because of foreign aid, Haiti has grown to 9-million people today!!!, creating an ecological disaster for that very tiny island. The more we feed them, the greater the population and the greater the misery and brutality.  We create the problem by encouraging massive overpopulation.  We need to leave them alone to return back to ecological balance.  100,000 Haitians could have a very nice existence via fishing and subsistence farming.  Yet our &#8220;kindness&#8221; will assure that in 20 years, there will be 18 million people in Haiti.  </p>

		<p> In the first place, who believes that a country that has been &#8220;independent&#8221;   &mdash;   allegedly   &mdash;   for over 200 years, and is still a basket case, can be somehow morphed into a prosperous, peaceful, Social Democrat republic, sort of like Sweden? If the Haitians haven&rsquo;t gotten it right yet, aren&rsquo;t we entitled to assume that they aren&rsquo;t GOING to get it right?</p>
<p> Mr. Schorr seems worried that the Haitians might see us as an &#8220;occupying power&#8221; if we took on the job of protecting them from themselves all on our lonesome. As a matter of fact, the U.S. has had to intervent in Haiti on a number of occasions throughout its history   &mdash;   most notably when we stationed U.S. Marines there from 1916 to 1934. I think we should just say, &#8220;Thanks, but no thanks&#8221; to the whole idea of yet another intervention, once the bankrupt country is set on the way to some kind of recovery from the earthquake. Let the UN handle things there on its own. Don&rsquo;t we have enough problems right now, without adding Haiti to them?</p>

		<p>Haiti surely cannot continue to stagger on forever as she has for the last two centuries? At some point her out-of-control birth rate, which is only possible because most of the population has long been kept alive by international food and medical aid, will become insupportable even for the international community.What will happen then I cannot foretell.</p>
<p>Ideally, the country would be taken over by an organisation with the resources and determination to carry out an eugenic reconstruction of the entire population, before restoring a stable Haiti with a much smaller, high quality, population to full independence a century or so later. Dream on.   </p>

		<p>Re Anonymous at 7.47 PM.<br>
Note also that envisioning safe, stable, healthy, and wealthy societies is difficult for many blacks to do. These qualities are so rare in American black society that the musical / rhetorical performance art called rap seems never to advocate or even mention any of these. Mayhem, nihilism, lust and death, yes, but health, wealth, stability never. The &#8220;blues&#8221; are similarly dying out because the sense of loss and regret associated with it are becoming fainter. It takes a conscience to sense loss and regret; rap glorifies psychopathic freedom from conscience. When we look at black society today we see an ever deepening vortex.</p>

		<p>A U.N. Trusteeship? Isn&rsquo;t the U.N. a miserable corrupt organization? We were told so in the earlier Amren article, &#8220;Religious Haitians See Hand of God in Earthquake.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;If all of a sudden, in 15 seconds, 20 seconds, all the physical representations of corruption are destroyed, it gives you pause for thought,&rdquo; said Richard Morse, a renowned Haitian-American musician whose mother was a singer and revered Voodoo priestess. &ldquo;The Justice Ministry: down. The National Palace: down. The United Nations headquarters: down.&rdquo;</i></p>

		<p> Haiti is a nation and will rise or fall based on their soverign abilities. Trusteeship is an attack on their right to govern themselves and I would be against that. In the U.S.A. if the U.N. decided that we needed to be a trusteeship what would be our response? HMMMM!</p>

		<p>Haiti is none of our business, but letting UN rule over anybody is not a good thing. First they will come for the Haitians, eventually they will come for us as well. Can there be no earthquakes and other natural or man-made disasters here? Can we not have some traitor community organizer sign an executive order to hand over our land to be ruled in a more &#8220;global&#8221;, &#8220;democratic&#8221; manner by our foreign enemies?</p>

		<p>I have yet to hear that the president of Haiti has actually declared a state of emergency. Strange, given the circumstances. I wouldn&rsquo;t like to have that on my CV&hellip; sometime president of Haiti. &#8220;Have you ever held a position of authority and how did you handle difficult decision making situations?&#8221; Meanwhile,,, and totally unrelated, somali pirates continue to hold international shipping to ransom and are about to murder an elderly British couple whose yacht was seized while the British Nany stood by and watched. UK still admits somali refugees and eventually jails most of them. Ah.. but of course.. they are all african.. somali or haitian.. all with the same IQ. It&rsquo;s obvious they can get by with an IQ of 70 as the 100 IQ Whites will always bow to their demands, bail them out, feed them, give them the wrong colour coveralls, demolish their slave shacks, elect them into government. Sigh.</p>

		<p>My two cents worth: let Haiti survive or die on its own. We&rsquo;ve subsidized them forever and to absolutely no avail. They spew hatred for us even as we save their lives. They are a bunch of lazy ingrates, and I say if any other nation or nations want to take up the burden, fine. We have more than our share of problems right here at home. Frankly, I feel pretty much the same about all the failed third world societies we&rsquo;ve tried to help over the last fifty years. I know that&rsquo;s harsh, but it&rsquo;s come to the point where it&rsquo;s just wasting money that we don&rsquo;t have to waste. I&rsquo;d like to know how much money we&rsquo;ve literally thrown away on welfare, domestically and abroad. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s in the high billions, if not trillions.</p>

		<p>At the beginning of the 19th Century, both Haiti and the United States had just achieved independence.  </p>
<p>Haiti paid several million to buy out the remaining French, while the US paid the same amount to buy out the French Louisiana Territory.  At that point in time Haiti was the richest country in the Western Hemisphere, while the United States was broke and in debt.  Fifty years later the White part of the US had worked its way up to becoming the richest country in the Western Hemisphere, while Haiti, with its African tradition, went the way of all sub-Saharan countries (and don&rsquo;t credit slavery for US prosperity, because the wealth grew only in the free states, while the slave states remain the poorest to this day)</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to think that the hurricane in Haiti put the final nail in the coffin of &#8220;economic equality&#8221; among all countries and territories on planet Earth.

<p>What a stupid argument. First of all stupid people CAN earn good incomes (Paris Hilton, Mike Tyson). Second thing - so what that the Africans may have lower average IQ. If you use this argument to stop African immigration, then maybe we all should just kill ourselves so that smarter Japanese and Chinese people can come and race-replace us? Using this IQ argument is so stupid, it&rsquo;s like saying that Africans should be happy that white colonizators settled in their countries.<br>
White movement should be based on the fact that every nation should have a right for a homeland and to practice their culture. </p>

		<p>To poster 18:<br>
First,recall that the iq argument is not made to deny individuals can achieve even with a lower than average iq; rather it is a statistical argument, based on large numbers.It suggests that, not knowing anything else, you would be correct if you thought a black person you met on a random basis had a lower iq than you, assuming you are white. So I suppose it is worthwhile to know when mingling, as most of us do, in an urban environment where &#8220;getting to know someone&#8221; is not practical. Snap judgements are not invalid simply because they are not in depth.<br>
Secondly speaking of depth, I don&rsquo;t think you know either celebrity in that way. If you did, maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t be so sure of the quality of those people; maybe they wouldn&rsquo;t impress you as being wealthy types. Without their costumes, without prior knowledge of who they were, I bet you&rsquo;d think of them as dumb, period.<br>
Thirdly, the white nationalist movement IS based on the necessity and desireablity of a relatively homogeneous population.<br>
Fourthly, actually many blacks do wish the colonisers hadn&rsquo;t left. They certainly don&rsquo;t mind the aid they receive from them and want to send their children to the best white schools if they can afford them. The same &#8220;clinging to the white man&#8221; is evident in USA politics. You have heard of Brown vs Board of Education, haven&rsquo;t you?</p>
