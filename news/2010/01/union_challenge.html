<h1>Union Challenges Invitation of British National Party to US Conference</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Workers Uniting (UK), January 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Leaders of the largest trade unions in the UK, Ireland, North America and Canada have made a fierce protest against the decision of a large hotel chain to host a conference due to be addressed by the leader of the far right British National Party (BNP) Nick Griffin.</p>
<p>In a letter to the Westin Hotel from the world&rsquo;s first international union, Workers Uniting which represents three million working people, expresses deep anger about the decision of the management to allow an individual whose views are so offensive to many to address a white supremacist conference on its premises.</p>
<p>The Westin Hotel chain has over 160 hotels and resorts worldwide. Workers Uniting, the world&rsquo;s first global union is a partnership between Unite from the United Kingdom and the United Steelworkers (USW) from the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>In their letter signed by Derek Simpson, Tony Woodley and Leo Gerard they say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Workers Uniting is appalled that the Westin would allow an individual whose views are so offensive and abhorrent to many, to hold a public address on its premises.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should be aware that a court order was made against the BNP after legal proceedings were issued against them on grounds that their membership requirements discriminated on grounds of, amongst other things, race. In 1996 Griffin received a nine-month prison sentence (suspended for two years) after being found guilty of distributing material likely to incite racial hatred. As well as this, Griffin is reported to have referred to the Holocaust as the &#8216;Holohoax&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Derek Simpson, Tony Woodley and Leo Gerard are urging the hotel management to reconsider their decision in order to avoid serious reputational damage to their business.</p>

<p>There you have it, the circular argument. Surely, if &#8220;many&#8221; are opposed, all the sheep should be opposed. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need for discussion among the proletariat. The International Socialist (I.S.) has decided that all workers under its control must think with one brain. </p>

<p>I recall seeing opinion polls on immigration that show more Brits agree with the BNP position than with the Labour and Conservative positions. </p>

		<p>The government of Britain does nothing but bring down anyone who works in their country. I don&rsquo;t beleive that a group called workers uniting is genuinely dedicated to the interest of workers, if they support the british government and oppose any who criticize it&rsquo;s anti-worker, anti-white policies. </p>

<p>It has been my experience, in dealing with unions and observing them, that their leadership is totally out of synch with their rank and file members. The leaders are a different kind, and they have ideas and an agenda all their own. Somehow they keep getting elected and imposing their agenda upon everyone else. They are completely totalitarian, no better than Bolsheviks.  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge chance that many of the captive members of those unions mentioned above would heartily agree with Nick Griffin (and perhaps many have voted for his party). </p>

 Workers Uniting, your views are offensive and abhorent to many. That means you should ban youselves.</p>

		<p>Modern British Trade Unions have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with fighting for workers&rsquo; rights.<br>
In fact they have stood four-square behind the New Labour governments policy of uncontrolled immigration that has ground pay and working conditions down to subsistance levels for Britain&rsquo;s most vulnerable workers (at a time of mass unemployment).<br>
 Maggoe Thatcher back in the &rsquo;80s castrated the British Trade Union movement and publically threw the testicles to the four winds for the crows to devour in a wondeful piece of reverse Freudianism.<br>
 Since that time the unions, Chronos like, have struggle to justified themselves and the money they thief out of gullible workers&rsquo; pay-packets each week.So they have become a refuge for a lot of nasty, stupid sub-college Marxist ideologues (most of whom have never done a day&rsquo;s toil in their lives)who merely use the power-base that the unions give them to grandstand a lot of nutty ideas, most of which have nothing to do with the poor fools who pay their dues, and some of which are actually antithetic towards them.</p>

		<p>How arrogant these Marxist fools are! The Unions are losing power as their membership numbers fall. They let down the 5000 workers at the Rover car plant and lead their members up the garden path.<br>
They have also supported the Labour party for years when they are supposed to be neutral politically. How i detest these champagne socialists. </p>
