			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Maske, Washington Post, January 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The NFL&rsquo;s hiring rule aimed at promoting diversity continues to work, according to the leaders of the group charged with enforcing it. The leaders of the Fritz Pollard Alliance, named for the first African American coach in NFL history, said they don&rsquo;t think the Seattle Seahawks and Washington Redskins improperly circumvented the rule that requires teams with head coaching vacancies to interview at least one minority candidate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some observers have criticized the coaching searches conducted by the Redskins and Seahawks and questioned whether the interviewing rule  &mdash;  widely known as the Rooney Rule after Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney, the chairman of the NFL&rsquo;s workplace diversity committee  &mdash;  worked properly in those cases.</p>
<p>The Redskins hired Mike Shanahan, a former two-time Super Bowl-winning coach for the Denver Broncos, after satisfying the rule by interviewing one of their assistant coaches, Jerry Gray, before firing Jim Zorn as head coach.</p>
<p>The Seahawks, who announced Monday they had agreed to a contract with Pete Carroll, satisfied the rule by interviewing Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier on Saturday, after some media outlets reported Friday that a tentative deal with Carroll already was in place.</p>
<p>Former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy said in a televised interview Monday that he feels Frazier&rsquo;s interview with the Seahawks &#8220;was done in fairness and the spirit of the law&#8221; but he thinks that Gray&rsquo;s interview with the Redskins set a &#8220;terrible precedent&#8221; because it was conducted before Zorn was fired.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NFL&rsquo;s franchise owners enacted their minority interviewing rule by acclamation in December 2002 under the threat of litigation by Mehri and late attorney Johnnie Cochran. At the time, there were two African American head coaches in the league. There were six this season (not counting Buffalo Bills interim coach Perry Fewell), down from a single-season high of seven in 2006.</p>
<p>There are now five African American general managers of teams league-wide, and Wooten and Mehri pointed out that five of the six Super Bowl clubs over the previous three seasons had either an African American head coach or GM.</p>
<p>Said Wooten: &#8220;These people that are hollering, I don&rsquo;t understand what the hollering is about. You&rsquo;re not trying to tell people who to hire.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When we look at the Rooney Rule, we&rsquo;re grateful and thankful. Before that, we had no way to go to these owners and get it done, and now we do.&#8221;<br>

		<p>&#8220;NFL teams are required to interview at least one non-white when hiring head coaches.&#8221;</p>
<p>How about a requirement that they must interview at least one white for wide receiver and other positions on the offensive squad? <br>

		<p>Only in this madhouse called the U.S.A. would an organization that is overwhelmingly black be required to interview blacks in order to promote diversity.</p>

		<p>Yes, I was going to say, do they ever interview white kids for the position of running back?  My guess is, the owners of the team(s) know exactly who they want to hire in advance, so they could interview 14 minorities and it wouldn&rsquo;t matter - they&rsquo;d go on and hire the guy they wanted all along.  And howcum the Mexicans and the Samoans aren&rsquo;t squalling about getting THEIR fair share of interviews???</p>

		<p>Expect this sort of thing to continue, and be amplified, as the balkanization and race replacement of whites continues. Once instituted, protected classes (blacks, women, gays) never willingly relinquish that status. Just look to South Africa for proof: whites are now only 9% of the population, yet they are still officially discriminated against with these policies. How will the US be different?</p>
<p>Speaking specifically to the NFL, this is an organization becoming more and more explicitly hostile to whites. It is becoming another institution for social hiring (hiring based on membership of a group, as opposed to a meritocracy). They now promote &#8220;breast cancer awareness&#8221; for the better part of October - even though prostate cancer kills as many people, and of course, all NFL players and most of its fans are men, not women! Blacks now have six coaches in the league - 20% of coaches - which means they are overrepresented by 50% relative to their number in the general population. Considering their lower IQs, we should expect to have maybe one black coach if hiring was done on merit alone. Of course, as we&rsquo;ve seen (thanks to Johnnie Cochran and other race extortionists), that will never be enough. Marginalizing white players like running backs, which is well documented by the Caste Football organization, will also never be enough. In the balkanizing United States, the protected classes will only be satisfied with the complete, permanent disenfranchisement of white men.</p>
<p>I suggest a boycott of this organization, partial or preferably total. If you absolutely can&rsquo;t resist watching games, at least limit your physical attendance to games and the purchase of NFL merchandise!</p>

		<p>The Rooney Rule was promulgated under threat of legal action. In essence, it&rsquo;s nothing but a quota system. And this for a league which is 70% Bantu.   </p>

		<p>Since the entire playing field in professional football is black, it would suit me fine if they&rsquo;d have nothing but blacks in the coaching and training positions, too. Turn it into a completely black run organization and watch it drop like a rock.</p>

		<p>Football is turning into the NBA by the minute.  There seems to be more penalties, trash talking, show boating, and random &#8216;incidents&rsquo; involving almost always a black player.  When was the last time there was a white cornerback or running back?  Probably back in the early &rsquo;90s.  </p>

		<p>Funny how this rule only works to benefit blacks.  Where is the Rooney Rule that forces NFL teams to draft at least one white running back, cornerback or wide receiver?  Everyone knows that whites are woefully underrepresented at certain positions but I don&rsquo;t see any league imperatives to redress this wrong.    </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m confused because it is very obvious that the Redskins did not interview anyone but Mike Shanahan and that the Browns didn&rsquo;t consider anyone but Mike Holmgren - are they going to face a hefty fine for hiring the people they wanted to hire?</p>
<p>Also, Tony Dungy was a famous Rooney Rule hire - he immediately went about hiring Lovie Smith (black), Herm Edwards (black) and Mike Tomlin (you guessed it, black) - and guess what?  He didn&rsquo;t even have to pretend to be interested in hiring anyone white.  </p>
<p>Who took his job when he vacated his head coaching job at Indie?  You guessed it, Jim Caldwell - another black guy he hired!</p>
<p>See a pattern in Dungys hiring practices?  You&rsquo;d have to be blind not to, but apparently the &#8220;Rooney Rule&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t care about Dungys blatant racist hiring practices.</p>
<p>Oh and yes, I&rsquo;m a proud white, not racist - unless wanting to be treated the same is being racist, and the NFL is my favorite sport, deal with it SPLC.</p>

		<p>If one of the goals of the Rooney Rule is to drive whites away from the sport, it&rsquo;s working.  I can no longer stand to watch the NFL. </p>
