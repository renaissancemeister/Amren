<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-politics/20100118/POLITICS-US-OBAMA-POLL/">U.S. Poll: Fewer See Obama Advancing Racial Ties</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fewer Americans believe the presidency of Barack Obama, the first African American elected to the White House, has helped advance race relations compared with a year ago, a Washington Post-ABC News poll suggests.</p>
<p>The poll, published on the U.S. holiday commemorating civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., found 41 percent now say Obama&rsquo;s presidency has helped race relations, compared with 58 percent on the eve of Obama&rsquo;s inauguration a year ago who said his presidency would help race relations.</p>
<p>The decline was the sharpest among African Americans, with 51 percent now saying Obama has helped advance race relations, compared with 75 percent who, last January, said they expected Obama&rsquo;s presidency to help.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to know exactly what&rsquo;s meant by &#8220;race relations.&#8221;  I think the translation is &#8220;we&rsquo;re not getting enough freebies from whitey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Was anybody so foolish as to believe that this pro-black community organizer would do anything but drive a wedge in the already precarious situation between the races?</p>
<p>Race relations have gotten worse and the reason for it, as always, is because of black, anti-white hatred.</p>

		<p>So only 51% of blacks now believe that the Mulatto Messiah has &#8220;advanced race relations.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s because, to a black, &#8220;advancing race relations&#8221; means &#8220;Whitey give me evathang ah wants.&#8221;</p>
<p>The forty acres and a mule haven&rsquo;t materialized, so the tribes are grumbling.  But so what?  Does anyone seriously think they&rsquo;ll vote for a White man next time around?<br>

		<p>I just read in the local newspaper about a black speaker at one of the area colleges saying that, while Obama is certainly a fine fellow, he is not in the same league as Martin Luther King. From reading the story, I surmised that few in the audience, black or white, objected to his observation. </p>
<p>It seems that Obama was endowed with magical powers, the ability to change human nature and erase thousands of years of evolutionary differences. Certainly the rapturous fawning of the media helped to carry away expectations to ridiculous levels. </p>
<p>I wonder what Obama&rsquo;s approval rating will be after three more years of reality?</p>

		<p>While it may be true that many Blacks (mainly middle aged and older ones)are less than optimisitc about race relations, especially those in lower income socio-economic groups, the fact remains is that the majority of Whites have never really beleived in any sort of interracial liasion or environment in any sustained way.</p>
<p>Therefore it is totally understandable that Blacks (especially those over 45)are slightly more dismissive of the supoposed reality of interracial harmony given the fact that the burden to embrace integration has been placed upon them. <br>

		<p>What this article ignores is that blacks don&rsquo;t want &#8220;improved race relations&#8221;; what they want is power, especially if acquired at the expense of whites.  That they are disappointed with Obama goes without saying.  The problem is that the reasons for their disappointment are the very opposite of what they should be.  </p>

		<p>Race relations will get better when Obama&rsquo;s crowd stops committing half of all crime, living off welfare, getting into college free, getting jobs they are not qualified for, and getting to call any White racist for any reason at all.</p>

		<p>Everything that a politician could possibly give to blacks has already been given to them by white politicians. What did they expect Obama to do, the well is dry? </p>

		<p>Blacks aren&rsquo;t concerned about improving race relations in the real sense. In fact, most whites aren&rsquo;t either. Blacks didn&rsquo;t elect the Big O to improve race relations. They elected him because the black mentality is to stick together above all, right or wrong. And they naively believed he would pay their house payments, buy their gas and be on their side of all decisions.</p>
<p><br>
But the Big O&rsquo;s historic reign is beginning to show signs of imploding. The power elite who manage and carefully orchestrates his administration can&rsquo;t (yet) control all wordly events, and certainly can&rsquo;t control acts of God. Take a look at the Big O campaiging and him now, reading the arranged psuedo-sympathetic offers of assistance to Haiti, and all other natural disasters - they are two totally different people. His strength is campaigning, but certainly not as a decision-maker or leader of state. That combination makes him the ideal puppet.<br>

		<p> From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;among African Americans, with 51 percent now saying Obama has helped advance race relations, compared with 75 percent who, last January, said they expected Obama&rsquo;s presidency to help&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Peggy the Moocher explained clearly and exactly what it is blacks expected from obama:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; I won&rsquo;t have to worry about putting gas in my car. I won&rsquo;t have to worry about paying my mortgage. You know. If I help [Obama], he&rsquo;s gonna help me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blacks, but not American blacks, will have their gas and mortgage paid  &mdash;  and a whole lot more  &mdash;  when the massive Haitian airlift beings and huge numbers of destitute, violent, low IQd Haitians hit the Florida shores in the name of &#8216;compassion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And, if anyone thinks obama is in charge of this country, he is dead wrong. He is playing his role as the perfect foil, as any and all criticism of him or &#8216;his&rsquo; policies are instantly branded as racism. </p>
<p>I doubt obama is intelligent enough to understand economic or foreign policy  &mdash;  he is only doing what his handlers tell him to do and say whatever it is they feed into his teleprompters.</p>
<p>He will also (as planned) play the fall guy and be blamed entirely for the &#8216;endless wars&rsquo;, high unemployment, financial and dollar collapse, rise of terrorism  &mdash;  things of which he has little to no understanding  &mdash;  while those truly in power hide behind him.</p>
<p>Clever plan, and it&rsquo;s unfolding exactly as it was meant to.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
