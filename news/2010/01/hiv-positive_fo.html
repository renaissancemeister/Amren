<h1>HIV-Positive Foreigners Enter US After Ban Lifted</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marcus Franklin, R&D; Magazine, January 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Dutch citizen who arrived in New York on Thursday was among the first HIV-positive foreigners to enter the United States since the Obama administration repealed a 22-year-old travel ban that opponents said unfairly stigmatized people living with the virus.</p>
<p>Clemens Ruland, 45, of the Netherlands, arrived at John F. Kennedy Airport on a flight from Amsterdam with his partner, Hugo Bausch, 50, for a one-week vacation.</p>
<p>Ruland, a psychiatric nurse and AIDS activist who works with criminal and troubled youth, told reporters he was thrilled that HIV-positive travelers to the U.S. were being treated equally.</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;People with HIV are not a threat to anybody, so there is no reason to exclude them,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>A Canadian citizen who traveled to Buffalo on Monday was the first person to cross the U.S. border on the day the repeal took effect, officials said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.S. ban kept out thousands of people over the years it was in place. Green card applicants were required to take an HIV test, said Steve Ralls, a spokesman for Immigration Equality, a New York-based legal advocacy group. He said the ban complicated the adoption of foreign children with HIV.</p>
<p>Opponents of the ban said it hurt public health policy and was discriminatory.</p>

<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Gaëtan Dugas, a homosexual French-Canadian flight attendant, played an instrumental role in the initial spread and propogation of the HIV virus in North America. His impact was so severe that he has been nick-named &#8220;Patient Zero.&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess Gaëtan Dugas wasn&rsquo;t a threat to anyone, huh?</p>
<p>I guess that all the men Patient Zero infected, who subequently spread HIV to other gay men in adult book stores and bath houses, weren&rsquo;t a threat to anyone either, huh?</p>
<p>After doing a search on google for &#8220;hiv homosexuals,&#8221; I came across an article; it said that homosexuals accounted for half of all newly acquired HIV cases in 2005. It further said that 1 out of 5 homosexuals in major urban areas have HIV. Other statistics show that homosexuals generally have a lot more sexual partners than heterosexuals. What this means is that allowing HIV+ people, particularly HIV+ homosexuals, to travel to America will result in more infections and even more subsequent infections.</p>

<p>As far as we know ALL new AIDS cases in the last 20 years happened when the AIDS virus spread from a person with AIDS to a person without AIDS.  The only way to catch AIDS is to be exposed to the  virus, which only exists in infected organisms.  All people with AIDS, had HIV first.  Yet, these people (and the Obama Administration) have the unmitigated nerve to tell us that &#8220;people with HIV are not a threat to anybody.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Diversity will kill us!</p>

		<p>In other news, Government officials announced today that, &#8220;Box cutters are not a threat to anybody, so there is no reason to exclude them from airplanes.&#8221;  </p>
<p>&#8220;I have a box cutter in my garage, and it has never hurt anyone.&#8221; said Irum LiBrill, Director of the Department of Really Stupid Government Decisions. &#8220;It would be prejudice to specifically target only those passengers with box cutters.  We must be fair, now,&#8221; said Mr. LiBrill.</p>

		<p>This means even more Africans since most are Aids infected. Who is going to pay for all these homosexuals and their meds and medical bills? Guess they will be included in the Obama care while at the same time taking $500 BILLION away from medicare that was for seniors&hellip;and people still think this is a &#8220;good and moral&#8221; country and we are in the ME fighting for &#8220;our freedoms&#8221;?  What a farce. We have been taken,but good.</p>

		<p>Gays should be against this the most because gays are most likely to suffer from HIV positive foreigners.</p>
<p>That being said, if someone comes to the US for a visit (not a green card) how would anyone really know one way or the other.  They would just declare &#8220;no&#8221; when asked at immigration.  So this probably won&rsquo;t have that much of an impact on the corpse of the US.  Once a body has suffered numerous fatal wounds how much more damage will one more cause?</p>

<p>I am sorry I am neither American nor HIV positive therefore I am ignorant in that area but doesn&rsquo;t the law state that if a person is HIV-positive, it clearly says so on his or her passport?  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Temporary Protected Status&#8221; for Haitian illegal aliens in U.S. as well as TPS Earthquake Asylum and Refugee visas.</p>
<p>A quick Internet tour reveals that the immigration industry lawyers are already jumping on this angle&hellip;.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;On 1/13/10, DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano and ICE Secretary John Morton halted all removals to Haiti for the time being in response to the devastation caused by the earthquake on 1/12/10. AILA Doc. No. 10011330&rsquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
&#8220;On 1/13/10, AILA President Bernard P. Wolfsdorf sent a letter asking DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano to act quickly to designate Haiti for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) under §244(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. AILA Doc. No. 10011364.&#8221; </p>

		<p>In my opinion, Obama was wrong to lift this ban.  From an economic viewpoint, our tax dollars could potentially be used to treat these people.  Also, this could constitute a public health crisis, considering that HIV positive gay men will probably go to gay resorts, at which a fair number of gay men do indeed have casual sex.  Fortunately, however, it appears that most European American gay men are protecting themselves nowadays. Of the approximately 60% of HIV infections which are attributed to MSM (men who have sex with men) that take place in the U.S. each year, it&rsquo;s appearing that the vast majority of them are black gay men..but this is still a threat, because although sex with a black man is mostly taboo in the gay community, a number of them will do it for some reason.  </p>

		<p>Like everything the homosexualists do, this involves a political statement.  I suppose next we&rsquo;ll be admitting third-worlders with TB because not to do so will be seen as racist.</p>

		<p>The HIV-positive Africans will mostly not be &#8220;Gay&#8221;.  Remember, one after another of Africa&rsquo;s astute and humane rulers have clearly stated that their countries either have no homosexuals, or that they are actively imprisoning and executing their homosexuals.</p>
<p>No, the Africans coming here with HIV will be proud heterosexual men who have simply engaged in homosexual activity (but it didn&rsquo;t count, you understand, because they were the &#8216;active&rsquo; partner/killed the homosexual after the act/were drunk/did it as an act of war/did it during gang-rape/did it with a man dressed as a woman&hellip;).  Otherwise, the HIV-positive Africans entering the country will be the Women and children married to, or raped by, the proud heterosexual HIV-positive menfolk.</p>
<p>Oh, did I mention the HIV positive Africans who became infected due to re-used needles during drug use, or even at clinics?  Then, there will surely be girls and women infected by shared &#8220;instruments&#8221; at &#8220;FGM parties&#8221;.  </p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t worry, Gay Conservative, that HIV-positive Africans will show up at Gay resorts.  They&rsquo;ll be too busy raising their families, while spreading their virulent new drug-resistant strains of the virus to prostitutes, needle-sharers, and rape victims of both genders.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful continent, and we so desperately need the richness of their vibrant cultures.  It&rsquo;s a small price for our healthcare system (or whatever will, by default, be our healthcare system) to expend our tax dollars on EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.</p>

<p>No, if a person is HIV+, it is not on his/her passport.<br>
