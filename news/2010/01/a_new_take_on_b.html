<h1><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-banks23-2010jan23,0,2274077.column">A New Take on Black History</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sandy Banks, Los Angeles Times, January 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This exhibit  &mdash;  &#8220;American I AM: The African American Imprint&#8221;  &mdash;  leaves no doubt about its vision: to &#8220;celebrate nearly 500 years of African American contributions to the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The exhibit, created by broadcaster Tavis Smiley, is on its third stop in a 10-city, four-year tour. It opened in Exposition Park in October and runs through April. On Monday, the day I visited, more than 700 people bought tickets to see it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The journey begins with an explanation of slavery  &mdash;  complete with artifacts like a slave ship manifest and ancient shackles and chains.</p>
<p>The docents keep a box of tissues on hand, &#8220;because some people get pretty worked up about it,&#8221; Lamison said. &#8220;You look at these things, and you can imagine the pain.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The exhibition starts on a somber note, but it ends with a triumphal tone, chronicling the influence of black culture on this country&rsquo;s politics and pulpits, stages and sports.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>How does a young girl reconcile the promise of the 1776 Declaration of Independence, on exhibit in one glass case, with the receipt in another from the 1776 sale of slaves, $100 for a Negro woman and her child? I understand those parents who  &mdash;  like me  &mdash;  try to tie their children to our history, even though we cannot know what images they will remember in this sweep from slavery to the presidency.</p>
<p>The snapshot I choose from my exhibit visit is quintessential Los Angeles:</p>
<p>A rambunctious little boy named Josh, brown curls bouncing as he mimics Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>His African American father leaning against the wall, absently fiddling with his iPhone.</p>
<p>And his young, blond mother explaining to his brown-skinned sister why Rosa Parks refused to stand and Martin Luther King was behind bars.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;ll bite.  What are they?  If anyone has ever been to the black history museum in Macon GA, they will see a pitiful collection of questionable &#8220;black inventions&#8221; such as brooms, door knobs and verandas.  How many African huts actually have door knobs and verandas?  </p>

WOW. Doesn&rsquo;t that just say it all? Why are Whites so obsessed about teaching their children about slavery, when even Blacks deep-down don&rsquo;t really care, unless it&rsquo;s something they can exploit for financial gain?</p>

		<p>Sounds like the same old, same old.</p>
<p>White &#8220;indentured servants&#8221; were often slaves in all but name.  Your kids never learn about that in our public schools.  And the schools will tell your kids who invented peanut butter but not who invented the transistor or the magnetic hard drive.</p>
<p>They are also doing their best to ensure that there will soon be no more blond women by encouraging them all to miscagenate.<br>

		<p>What is new about this exhibit? It is new only in the sense of being the latest in a long string of black &#8220;slavery&#8221; exhibits down through the years. Slavery seems to be the only thing blacks can think about  &mdash;  but only white-on-black, never black-on-black slavery (no mention of slavery practiced in Africa even today, for example). </p>
<p>Kind of like how the &#8220;atrocity&#8221; of South African apartheid was on every black&rsquo;s lips a couple of decades ago, but you never heard of the many black on black atrocities committed throughout the African continent. </p>
<p>And what kind of twisted message does it send to blacks that their most notable accomplishments were not their own achievements but rights and privileges that were given to them by whites? </p>
<p>By the way, every news story that I have read in my local paper about local aid given to Haiti was on the part of white philanthropists, with the exception of an Indian doctor sent by the white-run hospital  &mdash;  a white orphanage founder, a white professor studying Haiti&rsquo;s &#8220;educational system,&#8221; a white female doctor. But despite the proximity of Gary, I didn&rsquo;t read about any local blacks making an effort to help Haiti.</p>

		<p>Very sappy ending.</p>
<p>Interesting how a full 500 years of African American contributions can fit into one mobile museum. Interesting how it&rsquo;s the usual suspects everytime: slaves on a ship, Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, etc.  </p>
<p>Can you believe people still weep over slavery?? They should be weeping for joy that they were captured because they would have been slaves in Africa and Africa is a hellhole, especially for women and girls.</p>

<p>Laugh out loud!  500 years?  The United States has only existed 234 years!! (from 1776 to 2010)</p>
<p>Apparently the Black / White achievement gap does indeed include simple mathematics.</p>
<p>One also finds this wallowing around in misery from the almost ancient past to be absurd.  Slavery happened centuries ago: GET OVER IT!  One doesn&rsquo;t see Irishmen creating traveling exhibits about the Potato Famine!  I myself am part German, but do not go around in sack-cloth and ashes regarding the Fire-Bombing of Dresden!  Enough of this Black foolishness already! </p>

		<p>Why oh why, does black history take an entire month? If they are looking for black contributions, then 5 minutes would be enough. Slavery was a business, not a contribution. As a product of a business, these blacks were fed, clothed and sheltered, just like they are now, except now they gvie nothing in return except blight, whining, and more demands.</p>

		<p>The writer has it all wrong. The first Bantu slaves were brought to North America aboard a Dutch slave ship in 1619. That&rsquo;s 391 years, not &#8220;500 years&#8221;. </p>
<p>Martin Luther King liked to say, &#8220;before the Pilgrims were here, we were here&#8221;.</p>

<p>Carver did not invent &#8220;peanut butter&#8221; BTW. I believe it was in use long before he was around.</p>

		<p>I doubt that there&rsquo;s ever been a racial or ethnic group as lavishly and fulsomely praised as have black Africans in America.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m reasonably sure that there&rsquo;s ever been another major racial or ethnic group in history with such a paucity of social, economic, cultural, and scientific achievement as these same black Africans.</p>
<p>Celebrating long past and most often wholly invented stories of achievement is hardly the key to harnessing and developing an ethic of invention and achievement.</p>
<p>Rather, it simply encourages additional feelings of grievance and injustice on which black African popular culture thrives, to the exclusion of any real accomplishment, save such cultural milestones as break-dancing and gangsta rap.</p>

		<p>Blacks are always going on and on about slavery. To be honest, I find their one track agenda rather boring. I cannot understand why the blacks keep on reminding the world of their vanquished ancestors. I would imagine it&rsquo;s to extract sympathy and funds from the gullible. I am part German and Scottish. During the time of the Roman Empire my antecedents were vanquished, conquered peoples many of whom were enslaved and mistreated by the Romans. I do not go on ad nauseum on how my people were slaves and downtrodden. I do not expect Italians from around the world to donate funds to my cause, and I haven&rsquo;t petitioned the Italian government for restitution either.</p>
<p>By the way I found it most interesting that good old dad in the article is more interested in playing with his iPhone (a toy) than being a responsible, engaged parent to his mullato children.</p>

<p>NICE ONE LILITH!!!</p>
<p>Yes, I wondered about the 500 years myself: 2010 minus 500 equals 1510&hellip;not to far away from Columbus&hellip;mmmm.</p>
<p>Post #5: White &ldquo;indentured servants&rdquo; were often slaves in all but name. Your kids never learn about that in our public schools. </p>
<p>They certainly were WR. I&rsquo;m currently reading &#8216;The Redneck Manifesto&rsquo; by Jim Goad; whilst being a tad profane, Jim covers the early years of the pre-USA White &ldquo;indentured servants&rdquo; and how they were treated&hellip;I wasn&rsquo;t suprised by this, but I didn&rsquo;t know the full extent of rich White ownership of White slaves.<br>
As you said, nothing your kids will learn about at school. How can they be trained to feel &#8216;White privelidge guilt&rsquo; if they find out that eh? <br>
This mistreatment of the White underclass didn&rsquo;t end back then either&hellip;</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The snapshot I choose from my exhibit visit is quintessential Los Angeles&#8221;</p>
<p>Is her lovely little &#8216;snapshot&rsquo; really &#8220;quintessential Los Angeles?&#8221; I don&rsquo;t live in The USA, but come on people, how could that ridiculous little &#8216;family&rsquo; - complete with bored black father playing with pointless digital device - be quintessential of anything? Is everyone bloody useless in LA?</p>
