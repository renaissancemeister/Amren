			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Colin Fernandez, Daily Mail (London), Jan. 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A park ranger sacked for asking a black colleague if he &#8216;put polish&rsquo; on his legs has won £40,000 compensation after a judge ruled that skin colour is a &#8216;fact of life&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Michael Farmer said he was branded racist and even falsely accused of being a member of the British National Party after making the comment. </p>
<p>Lambeth Council sacked him under its &#8216;zero tolerance&rsquo; policy on racism after two disciplinary hearings. </p>
<p>But employment judge Lindsay Hall-Smith has ruled that he was unfairly dismissed, saying: &#8216;An individual&rsquo;s race or colour is a fact of life. It does not follow that alluding to such matters to or in the presence of the individual concerned necessarily involves racism or less favourable treatment of the individual.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The judge, sitting at the Croydon Employment Tribunal, described how an incident on May 7, 2008, had led to the dismissal of 52-year-old Mr Farmer. </p>
<p>He said there was &#8216;a significant amount of banter exchanged between the staff about a black member of staff, Dwight Parker, who had arrived at work wearing shorts for the first time in the year&rsquo;. </p>
<p>The judge said the switch to shorts &#8216;usually provoked humorous comments&rsquo;, and one woman, Diane Nash, even wolf-whistled at Mr Parker when he arrived. </p>
<p>Mr Parker claimed he heard Mr Farmer say: &#8216;Dwight, what are you doing putting polish on your legs?&rsquo; </p>
<p>When he realised that Mr Parker was &#8216;not the least amused by his comment&rsquo;, Mr Farmer followed it up by saying: &#8216;Well, I have to use sun tan lotion if I want a tan.&rsquo; </p>
<p>In an email to his boss, Mr Parker wrote: &#8216;I was really shocked when I heard what he said so I just looked at him and kept quiet.</p>
<p>I strongly believe Michael Farmer was being rude and disrespectful in a racially motivated way. </p>
<p>He requested a &#8216;full-scale investigation and disciplinary action&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Farmer told the council: &#8216;As is the tradition when a male colleague switches from wearing long trousers to shorts a certain amount of badinage ensues (last year when I was issued with new shorts there were cat calls and requests to turn the glare down from fluorescent legs). </p>
<p>&#8216;I have enjoyed a joke with Dwight on numerous occasions in the past. If I have offended Dwight this time then I can but apologise most sincerely.&rsquo; </p>
<p>But Mr Parker said he would not accept any &#8216;informal arrangements&rsquo; and after a two-day internal investigation, Mr Farmer was told that the allegations had been upheld and he was guilty of gross misconduct.</p>
<p>Mr Farmer, a married father of two from Catford, South-East London, carried on working for four months but was finally fired after a second disciplinary hearing chaired by council official Kyron Peters-Bean, whose title is Head of Resilience, in September 2008.</p>
<p>Its report concluded that &#8216;the most concerning aspect of the investigation&rsquo; was claims by two other rangers that &#8216;this was not the first time Michael Farmer had made statements of this nature&rsquo;. </p>
<p>But the employment tribunal found no evidence that Mr Farmer had made racist comments before. </p>
<p>The judge said: &#8216;The tribunal found it disturbing that the prejudicial conclusions of the investigatory process appeared to be founded upon allegations which had never surfaced during the interviews.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The tribunal found that Mr Peters-Bean was not a &#8216;convincing&rsquo; witness and was &#8216;evasive&rsquo; when cross-examined about how much he had taken into account Mr Farmer&rsquo;s alleged membership of the BNP. </p>
<p>The judge said: &#8216;We were driven to the conclusion that the disciplinary hearing failed to maintain an objective approach to the serious allegation against the claimant.</p>
<p>&#8216;The disciplinary panel had made up its mind that the claimant was going to be dismissed&hellip; and failed to give any consideration to any other sanction.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Mr Farmer, who has previously set up a black youth community football team, said the idea he was racist &#8216;was the antithesis of what I stand for&rsquo;. </p>
<p>&#8220;What chance do I have as a middle-aged man getting another job in a recession?&rsquo; </p>
<p>A Lambeth Council spokesman said: &#8216;We have a responsibility to take grievances from our staff seriously and investigate them rigorously, but we accept the ruling of the tribunal.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Do blacks themselves think there&rsquo;s something wrong with blackness?  What if the aggrieved man had asked a white co-worker, &#8220;Do you put bleach on your legs?&#8221;  No one would have considered that racist.</p>

A couple years back, a Niagara Falls city worker was charged with a &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; for putting a &#8216;whites only&rsquo; sign on a water fountain as a joke.</p>
<p>He thought his black co-workers were his friends and could laugh at the joke. They didn&rsquo;t see a joke, they saw an opportunity.</p>
<p>The poor stupid lug didn&rsquo;t know what hit him. His black &#8216;friends&rsquo; acted as if this prank was the first stage of a lynching. It was all over the top. They put him through the ringer.</p>
<p>When interacting with blacks, don&rsquo;t ever assume they&rsquo;re your friends. Keep the conversations purely professional. Don&rsquo;t tell jokes or make risqué comments that can be twisted or misconstrued.</p>
<p>The best advice is to have as little contact as possible. It&rsquo;s better to be considered aloof than to be confirmed as a &#8216;racist&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>The black was hoping to be able to get some money for his unethical complaint, which, I&rsquo;m positive, he knew was bogus.  But, more than that, it was a kick in the teeth to a co-worker.</p>
<p>At all times from here on out the black should always be viewed with extreme suspicion and watched closely for further immoral conduct.  Certainly, he can&rsquo;t be trusted as a unified member of any working team.</p>
<p>That this Farmer declared how non-racist he was makes me want to vomit, so I&rsquo;m glad he got fired.</p>
<p>As it turned out it was a win-win for people who think as I do:  1) The black was made to look unreasonable and the plaintiff received compensation for the black injustice, with the rabidly politically correct employer having to pay; and 2)The non-racist grovelling white lost his job which might make him think twice about his pro-black views. (But I doubt it.)</p>
<p>So, the bottom line is that a black whiner</p>

		<p>This case says it all about England&rsquo;s one-sided race relations industry.A harmless comment is transformed into a hate crime and a white man loses his job.Meanwhile one is permitted,nay encouraged, to perpetuate the lie that the entire female population of Essex is comprised of promiscuous foul-mouthed blonde illiterates.The only suprise about this case is that the former Park Ranger actually received £40,000  compensation,although had he been black or asian no doubt the sum would have been nearer £400,000.     </p>

		<p>In my experience black co-workers are the ones most likely to engage in sex jokes, ethnic humor, flirting and  teasing.</p>
<p>Of course when someone offends one of them they demand instant firings and a lenghty investigation.</p>

		<p>This sounds like a &#8216;mountain out of a mole hill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But some of the wording/phrasing that leaps out at me from reading this are&hellip;.<br>
&#8216;branded racist&rsquo;, &#8216;falsely accused of being a member of the British National Party&rsquo;,  &lsquo;zero tolerance&rsquo; policy on racism, two-day internal investigation and council official Kyron Peters-Bean, whose title is <b>Head of *Resilience</b>(?)</p>
<p>* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilience_(organizational)" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilience_(organizational)</a><br>
<i>Resilience is defined as &ldquo;the positive ability of a system or company to adapt itself to the consequences of a <b>catastrophic failure caused by power outage, a fire, a bomb or similar&rdquo; event.</b></i></p>
<p>Racism is on the same level as a bomb attack now?</p>
<p>I know that it&rsquo;s a cliché on this site to comment on George Orwell when talking about the UK, but I can&rsquo;t think of any other applicable comparison in this case?</p>
<p>And the on the accused&hellip; <br>
&#8216;Mr Farmer, who has previously set up a black youth community football team..{snip}.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(I must admit I love it when the liberally inclined get to feel the wrath of political correctness first hand, teaching them that nothing you can do will ever make you safe from prosecution, he he.)</p>
<p>Before reading this story properly I was thinking a lot more light heartedly about how &#8216;down here&rsquo; there is anti skin cancer education aimed at those of us who have a &#8216;permenant tan,&rsquo; warning them that they are not immune to the dangers of the sun and thus must also &#8216;cover up&rsquo; even with their dark veneer&rsquo;s.<br>
Looks like skin cancer the least of all these concerns.</p>

		<p>This Mr. Farmer is just another White liberal getting what he deserves, and I&rsquo;m disappointed he won anything. Looks like he was good &#8220;pals&#8221; with this black guy, Mr. Parker, and was stabbed in the back by him the 1st chance he had.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s soooooo many &#8220;Mr Farmers&#8221; out there folks. It&rsquo;s the Mr. and Ms. Farmers of the world that&rsquo;s put us in this mess we&rsquo;re in today. I&rsquo;ll always remember the saying - there&rsquo;s no such thing as black power, just White weakness, which is mistaken for black power. Mr. Farmer fits this to a &#8220;T&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Of course he would not accept a simple apology,it was about gett&rsquo;in PAID!! Why do people not accept an apology-why take offense when none was intended,they want to blow things out of proportion at a percieved slight. They want to get on the bandwagon and wrongly enrich themselves by whinning about discrimination,which is fine in the PC world,of course unless the shoe is on the other foot and your white!!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m extremely happy for this gentleman. Britain is the compensation capitol of the world for immigrants and non whites. Police chiefs and and other black/Asian civil workers have had payouts in the region of £700,000. <a href="https://northfieldpatriot.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">https://northfieldpatriot.blogspot.com/</a></p>

		<p>The problem with &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; rules is it means that there is no forgiveness, no mitigating circumstances, no room for unintentional slights, draconian consequences to transgression large or small.  Odd that the charges of murder and rape have gradations of severity and judicial consequences.  But ill-defined racism, where injury is often small to non-existent, is absolute and the punishment severe.<br>
I suggest the following: racism charges must represent the underlying populations (i.e. 12% blacks means a like percentage of racism charges to that population), otherwise the procedures and the governing body are deemed racist.  Further that there be a zero tolerance policy to the council that metes out the determination of racism.  Thus in this case, the council members should lose their jobs over the mis-application of racism.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what was so offensive about his comment. Further more, I don&rsquo;t understand why the British government has all but lost the ability to punish violent criminals yet has the ability to wreck this man&rsquo;s life over a mediocre comment of mediocre offense. Perhaps the larger issue is the guilt by his supposed association of the BNP. Notice the two park rangers that couldn&rsquo;t wait to stab this man in back, as if being demonized in the press weren&rsquo;t enough.  </p>

		<p>Plenty of people get offended by minor things said by others on the job or elsewhere, some intentional some not. I myself have been many times in my life. It is absurd to fire someone who gives minor offense. Actually, Mr.Farmer meant nothing by it, he apologized so that should have sufficed. However, what Mr.Parker really wanted was to win the &#8220;Ghetto Lottery&#8221; and make some $$$$.</p>

		<p>Those whites who continue to believe they can actually be friends with blacks are fools.  Those whites who continue to insist they&rsquo;re far from racists are delusional. All whites, by virtue of birth, are guilty in black eyes, and the more they grovel the more they are detested by both black and white.  I no longer view anyone as neutral on this issue.  Every contact with a black, in whatever context, is a potential problem to be avoided.  Mr. Farmer is a buffoon, Mr. Parker is professional victim; a plague on both their houses. </p>

		<p>Mr Farmer is suffering the consequences of slobbering a friendship with parker and his like. I know by experience to not even look or say a word to blacks. We should practice silence with them at all times. And this will bring you closer to your folk. &#8220;H&#8221;</p>
