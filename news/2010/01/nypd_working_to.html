<h1>NYPD Working to Improve Its Diversity</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WCBS-TV (New York), Jan. 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The New York Police Department says it&rsquo;s attracting a growing number of officers who were born outside the United States. </p>
<p>The department has been working to improve its diversity. It began tracking officers&rsquo; nationalities in July 2006. </p>
<p>Of the 5,593 hired since then, 1,042 were foreign-born. </p>
<p>They came to the U.S. from 88 countries.</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic leads with 263 officers. Other contenders: Haiti, 78; Jamaica, 59; Pakistan, 29; and Russia, 18. </p>
<p>Commissioner Raymond Kelly says understanding different languages and cultures makes it easier for officers to do their &#8220;complex and demanding&#8221; work. </p>

		<p>It would seem appropriate for new arrivals (and guests) to be sensitive to our legal and cultural norms rather having our law enforcement personnel become conversant and sensitive to theirs.</p>
<p>The simple fact is that most felonies and misdemeanors are universally recognized as such.  The notion that we have to recruit foreign-born cops to explain the obvious to these interlopers is absurd on its face.</p>
<p>Murder is murder, theft is theft, vandalism is vandalism, assault is assault, and lying is lying everywhere in the world. We don&rsquo;t cops from any particular race or ethnicity to explain this to foreigners.</p>

<p><br>
This &#8220;news&#8221; is hardly anything new at all.  The NYPD has been working on diversity for years. And STILL, there isn&rsquo;t enough! (Will there ever be?)  </p>
<p>I joined the Department back in 1979, and they were busily working on it even then   &mdash;   although at that time, it was focused on increasing the numbers of blacks and females. Also Hispanics.  Now, that goal largely achieved, it&rsquo;s gone far beyond that in a zeal to encompass every language, culture, and nationality on the surface of the earth. There&rsquo;s no end to it!</p>

		<p>The NYPD has always attracted the most moronic (and corrupt) elements of any applyng groups. As someone with a partial Italian heritage, I&rsquo;m ashamed that the Italian-Americans who joined the NYPD in past generations were the bottom of the barrel.  Now, the barrel is getting deeper. Now, the worst of the lowest IQ groups will be enforcing the law. As an example, the NYPD recruits Chinese officers.  Most of them are the children of imigrants born in China. Those 50 year old parents were young during the genocides of the Great Leap Forward &amp; the Cultural Revolution which slaughtered 40 million Chinese. If mom &amp; dad survived, it&rsquo;s probably because they were part of the murdering class. Now their illiterate kids, who have no understanding of the Founders&rsquo; Constitution, will be &#8220;the law&#8221; in NYC.    </p>

<p>They&rsquo;re making a BIG mistake, but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.  We&rsquo;re headed for some austere, chaotic conditions, and most government employees are going to be cut to skeletal levels, and the police will be no exception.</p>
<p>Look for government revenues to drop precipitously as we go further into the new year.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an article from Newsweek about New York: </p>
<p>The Big Apple&rsquo;s Big Problem</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/228939" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsweek.com/id/228939</a></p>
<p>Basically says New York has to become more business and family friendly.   Maybe so, but the real story out of New York was the news a few weeks ago that the city council is now majority non-white.  New Yorkers are fooling themselves, as is the rest of the country,  if they think they can maintain their position in finance as a third-world city.  New York mirrors the nation in that the ruling elite have maintained a segregated bastion, Manhattan, while supporting multiculturalism, falsely believing they can sacrifice the lower classes while the effects of third-worldization won&rsquo;t touch them.   In the end Wall Street will leave and New York will do the Detroit.   </p>
<p>Speaking of Detroit, here&rsquo;s a story from Time about its decline, caused by white racism, Coleman Young, and the decline of the auto industry, not by the ethnic cleansing of whites by the policies and beliefs of liberalism or the inabilities of blacks:</p>
<p><br>
Detroit: The Death  &mdash;  and Possible Life  &mdash;  of a Great City</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/ycs8jsw" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/ycs8jsw</a></p>
<p>The author cannot really believe that &#8220;white racism&#8221; is to blame for Detroit&rsquo;s decline, but whites are always available to be bashed and blamed in white-hating, Liberal  racist America.  </p>

		<p>These police offices speak standard American English or do they speak with an accent, heavy or otherwise?</p>
<p>If confronted by such an officer, my initial instincts would be to wonder if HE WAS REALLY AN OFFICER OF THE LAW OR MERELY AN IMPOSTOR!! REALLY!</p>
<p>I guess the answer would be that we need those that speak the languages, do community policing, develop rapport with the locals, know the culture, etc. </p>
<p>There would be suspicion and resentment on my part when confronted by one of these guys? I do wonder!</p>

		<p>The current NY PD is a disgrace. Just go to any event or location that requires a large police presence and you will see what I mean. It looks like a convention of buffon&rsquo;s and thug&rsquo;s. A well kept secert is that only a conviction of a felony is an automatic bar to appointment as a Police Officer, but many many of these buffon&rsquo;s were arrested for felonies and had the case pled down to a misdemeanor, so they are not barred from joining the PD. Just recently David Patterson Gov of NY granted a pardon from a felony conviction for gun possession to some hispanic applying to join the NY PD, so now it is up to the PD if this person is allowed to join the Dept or not. I wouldn&rsquo;t put any money on him being rejected.</p>

		<p>When I get up to town (NYC) from time to time, I always notice the cops. What I see when I look at them is a bunch of sad sack individuals. Sloppily dressed, out of shape, lazy looking misfits. I have a friend who&rsquo;s a retired cop and when I tell him, he cringes, because he agrees. It&rsquo;s not his fault. It&rsquo;s all the people taken on the force that years ago wouldn&rsquo;t have had a chance to qualify for the NYPD in any way due to the standards of those times. Now that those standards are long gone, anybody can see the results.</p>

		<p>If you, as a White, were in need of a police officer for any reason and one of Haitian, Jamaican, Dominican, Pakistani or even Russian extraction showed up, would you trust him to work in YOUR best interests? to follow American laws? to arrest a back criminal against you, a White victim of a black criminal?</p>
<p>How will these new, foreign-born &#8216;officers of color&rsquo; react to crimes committed by their fellow ethnics, especially crimes against Whites?</p>
<p>Which do I trust to protect my Civil Rights, a non-White police officer, knowing that most of them despise us and would just as soon see us dead, or my trusty non-prejudiced Mossberg?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put my faith in the Mossberg, knowing it won&rsquo;t let me down.</p>

____________________</p>
<p>The &#8220;real story&#8221; is that the NYC City Council has been majority non-white for a LONG time now.  But it all depends on how you define &#8220;white&#8221;.  Now, it&rsquo;s just becoming more noticeably non-white. Little by little.  We are told this ia a good thing. It&rsquo;s progress.  It makes us competitive.  It makes us stronger. </p>
<p>As for the stock market and financial services industry, moving elsewhere will be all the easier now with computers and electronics. The work can be done anywhere in the world, no need to be in New York at all, or even the US.  Don&rsquo;t be surprised if you see the market move to Shanghai or Singapore.  I don&rsquo;t mean tomorrow, of course, but eventually that could be coming.  Those savvy investors with their ears to the ground are already anticipating it and making their adjustments.  Shanghai is seen as the next big place, the world financial center for the 21st Century.  (I&rsquo;m not kidding.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been planned that way for at least the past thirty years.  The United States has been slated for Third world status and our &#8220;greatest&#8221; city will reflect that - a Third world police force, a Third world government, and a Third world population ruled over by the Globalist Banksters from their armored citadels.</p>

		<p>Similar to the NYPD&rsquo;s relentless pursuit in diminishing the white man&rsquo;s presence in law enforcement, Canada&rsquo;s largest city, Toronto, is also desperately working to diversify a once proud police service. </p>
<p>#10 says, <i>&#8220;Supposedly, Caribbean blacks have a godfather within the department, and so have an edge in recruitment.&#8221;</i></p>

		<p>Anonymous @ 6:18PM: Thanks for that Toronto recruitment poster. Very interesting.</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s not much different from a NYPD poster, except for the absence of Asian and Hispanic females.<br>
 <br>
I remember Toronto when I was a kid when we used to drive there from Rochester for a weekend of big-city shopping and entertainment. It was a clean, safe city that was 99.999% white.  Some influential people, even then, didn&rsquo;t like it that way. They complained that it was too virtuous, too Anglo, too Christian, and too &#8220;boring&#8221;. Nothing exciting ever happened there. (But nothing terrible either.) &#8220;Toronto the Good&#8221; is what they sarcastically called it.</p>
<p>So they changed it.  Just look at it now.</p>
