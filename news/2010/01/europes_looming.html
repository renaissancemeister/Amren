			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pamela Geller, Washington Times, December 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;The Europe as you know it from visiting, from your parents or friends is on the verge of collapsing,&#8221; Geert Wilders said in a speech in the United States last year.</p>
<p>The leader of the Netherlands&rsquo; populist Party for Freedom added: &#8220;We are now witnessing profound changes that will forever alter Europe&rsquo;s destiny and might send the Continent in what Ronald Reagan called &#8216;a thousand years of darkness.&rsquo;&#8221; And not just Europe, but America as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Come Jan. 1, 2010, a disastrous and suicidal pact called the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (Europe/Mediterranean) goes into effect with little fanfare or examination. It boggles the mind that such a consequential and seismic cultural shift could be mandated and put into play without so much as a murmur from the mainstream media.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The European human rights group called Stop the Islamization of Europe (SIOE) has been working tirelessly to expose the mass Muslim immigration plan of the Euro-Med Partnership.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The goal of the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation is to create a new Greater European Union encompassing both Europe and North Africa, with the Mediterranean Sea becoming a domestic Eurabian sea. The goal is to establish a &#8220;comprehensive political partnership,&#8221; including a &#8220;free trade area and economic integration&#8221;; &#8220;considerably more money for the partners&#8221; (that is, more European money flowing into North Africa); and &#8220;cultural partnership&#8221;  &mdash;  that is, importation of Islamic culture into post-Christian Europe.</p>
<p>According to the SIOE, in the Euro-Med plan &#8220;Europe is to be islamized. Democracy, Christianity, European culture and Europeans are to be driven out of Europe. Fifty million North Africans from Muslim countries are to be imported into the EU.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skeptical? It&rsquo;s already happening. The British newspaper the Daily Express reported in October 2008 on &#8220;a controversial taxpayer-funded &#8216;job centre&rsquo;&#8221; that opened in Mali at that time as &#8220;just the first step towards promoting &#8216;free movement of people in Africa and the EU.&rsquo; Brussels economists claim Britain and other EU states will &#8216;need&rsquo; 56 million immigrant workers between them by 2050 to make up for the &#8216;demographic decline&rsquo; due to falling birthrates and rising death rates across Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>To offset this decline, a &#8220;blue card&#8221; system is to be created that will allow card holders to travel freely within the European Union and have full rights to work  &mdash;  as well as the full right to collect welfare benefits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And once in Europe, Muslims have already begun demanding special privileges and accommodations. IslamOnline reported on Dec. 21 that &#8220;Muslims activists from 26 European countries have come together to launch the first rights council to enlighten European Muslims about their rights, monitor rising Islamophobia and defend Muslim rights in European courts of law.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Islamophobia,&#8221; &#8220;discrimination&#8221; and &#8220;racism&#8221; are all terms Muslims in Europe and America use to confuse people into thinking that the perpetrators of Islamic terrorism are the real victims. And it is working: Mr. Wilders is going on trial in the Netherlands, instead of all the Islamic hate sponsors he is fighting against. It has to be this way, to increase harmony among the Muslim and non-Muslim member states of the Euro-Med Partnership.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Population replacement&rsquo; ends up being nearly doubly effective, in that wherever diversity is up (to offset the population decline), the white birth rate goes down. How many of those births are to a non-white father is another question.  </p>

		<p>The trillions of dollars in recent financial promises and obligations can only be met by pumping up the First World work force with millions of Third World bodies. </p>
<p>Consumption of resources will be unrelenting. No stone shall be left untouched. Water, fuel, air, and empty spaces that are currently unused will be deemed to be &#8216;under-performing&rsquo;, and shall be duly harnessed to the slave serf economy.  Everything will have a price put on it. Liberty will cease to exist.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t care how problematic Europe&rsquo;s low birth rate is&hellip;</p>
<p>The solution is surely not 56 million screaming, intolerant Muslim immigrants full of anti-white hostility.</p>
<p>Look at how they&rsquo;ve already killed white pols that oppose them - is anyone delusional enough to think that Muslims will moderate as their numbers grow?</p>

		<p>One often hears exhortations from the pulpit telling the Christian he should cheerfully suffer for Christ. More often than not, this is the signal for the parishioners to open up their wallets and put a few Dollars in the collection plate. If current trends in North America and in the European mother continent continue, the White Christian inhabitants are likely to find out that suffering involves more than parting with a few Dollars once a week.</p>

		<p><i>Brussels economists claim Britain and other EU states will &lsquo;need&rsquo; 56 million immigrant workers between them by 2050 to make up for the &lsquo;demographic decline&rsquo; due to falling birthrates and rising death rates across Europe.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t they heard of the stress our <i>current</i> population is apparently putting on the environment?</p>
<p>And for &#8220;economists&#8221; I find their claim highly flawed:<br/>
When the ageing Europeans are long gone, and these immigrant workers are facing retirement (if the non-white immigrants from the &#8216;60&rsquo;s onwards didn&rsquo;t leave, barring catastrophe these ones won&rsquo;t either) who will be imported to support <i>them</i>? And will we &#8220;need&#8221; these immigrants when Japan perfects robotic caregivers, labourers etc?</p>
<p>This short-sighted argument also ignores migrant fertility and (even excluding global warming) the pressure placed on what remains of Europe&rsquo;s natural environment.</p>

		<p>in western civilized countries, there is a clear, distinct separation of church and state, and that is the only way it should be, but for muslims, islam=government, and government=islam. It won&rsquo;t be long before muslims will be voting to end democracy in europe and replacing it with islamic law</p>

		<p>Not just Europe, but America, too, and not just Muslims but every other non-European migrant as well.  I can&rsquo;t stand &#8220;Conservatives&#8221; who think the U.S. is better off than Europe in this regard.  The focusing on the Muslim nature of this invasion instead of the real problem, the extermination of the culture and people of the West, is s cowardly Conservative&rsquo;s way of avoiding conflict with the dominant left over the issue of race, since he can pretend it&rsquo;s only about religion.  But the reality is that Europeans would  be no better off, and possibly worse off,  being displaced by Africans rather than by Muslims.   What&rsquo;s important is that they are being displace, not who&rsquo;s displacing them.   The modern Conservative conserves nothing,  not even his own people.   I suppose we should grateful that many of the migrants ARE Muslims, though,  otherwise Conservative papers like the Washington Times wouldn&rsquo;t dare criticize the invasion.   </p>

<p><br/>
Indeed it is!  It sounds so farfetched, so overly dramatized, that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to believe it either if I hadn&rsquo;t been there just a few days ago.   It&rsquo;s real enough!  Anyone with eyes to see can see it all around you. </p>
<p>But, strangely, while you see it everywhere, you don&rsquo;t hear it mentioned anywhere.  It is a tabooed topic. Nobody mentions it. Nobody acknowledges it. People won&rsquo;t discuss it. Very strange! It&rsquo;s surreal.  This is the New Europe   &mdash;   prosperous and comfortable, for the moment, but silenced while they await their own displacement! Most of them don&rsquo;t even realize that, I suppose, or don&rsquo;t dare think about it.</p>

		<p>The EU will need 56,000,000 foreign workers??? They might want to rethink this&hellip; You can&rsquo;t take the salt out once its dumped in! In all fairness though the Europeans must be aware of what their doing.. but I can&rsquo;t see the logic to it. Is this the will of the people? Geert Wilders.. is like the lone voice crying out in the wilderness* hope he doesn&rsquo;t end with his head on a platter for trying to prevent this cultural sucide.</p>

		<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be simpler and quicker if all the Europeans just shot themselves?  That way they could make room for the new and improved occupants without the new occupants having to put up with the discrimination and whining of the outgoing population.  You tear down the old house before building the new, correct?  The current crop of Europeans have had a good run of it and now it is time to pass the baton.</p>

<p>Hmmm, which one do you think muslims are going to choose, work or welfare? My money is on welfare, I can&rsquo;t believe white Europeans actually think third world non-whites are actually coming into Europe so they can work and take care of this continents aging white population. This is absolute fantasy, and the muslims just shake their heads in disbelief that whites can be this dumb and gullible..</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical about the true agenda of Wilders and Geller.  They are part of a euro-neocon network that disassociates itself from mainstream European Nationalists like the BNP and the FN.  They seem to want to be like European version of the GOP, with a neocon foreign policy and acceptance of non-white immigration, so long as the non-whites in question are not Muslims.</p>

		<p>It would be great if most Europeans could forsee the abject consequences of importing 56,000,000 Muslims into their countries. Unfortunately, most people don&rsquo;t perceive any danger of a coming disaster until the disaster actually hits, which means that Europe will have to become even more multicultural before most people&rsquo;s eyes open to the mass Euricide that will happen if things don&rsquo;t change.</p>

		<p>Somehow, I don&rsquo;t think this is the fate that the radical Feminists (the equivalent of mainstream &#8220;Feminism&#8221; today) of the 70&rsquo;s envisioned.</p>
<p>Logically, how could it have ended any other way? Their hatred of those (White males) that gave them the equality (supremacy?) they so desired has consumed them, and, when the normal urge of having children is considered &#8220;oppression&#8221; (if the father is a White male), Western civilization is lost. That&rsquo;s why there is a demographic crisis in the West. Dogs have become the &#8220;babies&#8221; of the Feminists. What kind of future does this create? One that is Islamic and African.</p>

		<p>Why are Europe&rsquo;s elites so determined to destroy Europe as we know it??  As these elites effectively control all of the institutions the only recourse for the European peoples may be to engage in revolutions and overthrow the existing governments where justified.  Revolutions have occurred throughout recorded history so why not now??  </p>
<p>Many successful revolutions were accomplished with a small, but highly determined group of people out of the whole population.  Previous revolutions were precipitated over much less important issues than the planned replacement of the European peoples that is occurring in the present day. </p>

		<p>Having fewer babies is actually the smart way to back off from the impending collapse of the world&rsquo;s resources.  The problem is that governments would lose revenue and capitalists would loose wealth because the markets would have to shrink.  So everyone is willing to sacrifice the cultures and people responsible for the highest cultural acheivements in the history of mankind.  And its just for the sake of money and fear of losing it.  Don&rsquo;t fret too much, this won&rsquo;t work.  After Europe and everywhere else is inundated with third world baby making cultures, when the entire world looks like India, China and Africa, these people will turn on one another and eat eachother alive, they won&rsquo;t have a choice because it will soon be impossible to prevent rampant starvation and disease.</p>

		<p>To me it is simply beyond comprehension. Europe was under attack several times by Islam and it cost hundreds of thousands of lives,(a lot back then)to stop it. I once mentioned that when I was on a vacation in Austria, I visited a museum, that housed the suits of armor, beautifully preserved and polished, that the Austrian army wore at the time of the invasion of Islam. Islam was stopped at the gates of Vienna, at the time. Yet now, we read of Europeans simply being oblivious to the sacrifices of their ancestors, and for what, in the name of some nebulous concept like diversity, that might actually result in no diversity at all. It&rsquo;s beyond insane.</p>

		<p>To be fair, I live in a dorm in Germany now, right next to the immigrant dominated welfare dorm. The government pays the mainly Turkish and African immigrant male to go to school, and supports his wife and children in a liveable &#8220;dorm&#8221; most of us would call an apartment. Now, the young Germans aren&rsquo;t innocent either. Most actually do get a degree and get out, but there is a slow growing number who do the American thing and stay in college for six years or more, fed on an white academic type of welfare (because we let anyone into college).</p>
<p>We need to get rid of this riffraff, but we also need to (especially in the US) discipline the youth. The nanny state needs to go. Skeptical? Maybe better institutions of learning don&rsquo;t have this problem, but look into state schools. To be a full-time student you don&rsquo;t even need to take enough credits to graduate in four years to qualify for federal aid. </p>
<p>On the same token, it&rsquo;s not all the students&rsquo; fault; we&rsquo;re giving jobs away to third-worlders teaching college labs. The economy is down. Export our riffraff so citizens can support themselves, but then make it impossible for them to laze around on academic welfare. An undisciplined youth will not bring home the bacon when social security needs it.  </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t understand the talk about &#8220;missing workforce&#8221;. There is so many unemployed people in Europe, especially among the young and among those over 45 yrs age. The tendency is here and it won&rsquo;t go away, so why import more and more people with low qualification?</p>
<p><i>IslamOnline reported on Dec. 21 that &ldquo;Muslims activists from 26 European countries have come together to launch the first rights council to enlighten European Muslims about their rights, monitor rising Islamophobia and defend Muslim rights in European courts of law.&rdquo;</i><br/>
Nothing new. They are exactly copying the Jewish approach, including an introguction of religious courts for family affairs. </p>

		<p>The cultural leftists of both Europe and America apparently think that replacing Christian &#8220;oppression&#8221; with sharia will allow them to openly practice libertine sexuality, Wiccan, atheism, or whatever their hearts desire.  Uh uh.  The Moslems consider Christianity to be a religion &#8220;of the Book&#8221; and will more likely than not tolerate it.  What they won&rsquo;t tolerate are comedians making fun of Jesus (one of their revered prophets) and signs in state capitols mocking theism and proclaiming atheism.  </p>

		<p>This has nothing to do with birth rates, talking about birth rates is the way the system blames its victims.   This is a conscious policy of genocide, not a natural phenomenon, and one way to begin to counter it is to not let anyone forget that simple fact.   It&rsquo;s a testament to the one-eyed fixation the left has for exterminating whites that these people ally themselves with Muslims, apparently on the enemy of my enemy principle.   They just don&rsquo;t care what comes after or if the changes will produce a better society,  they&rsquo;ll ally themselves with anyone who is anti-white and anti-West.   These are the same people who have for decades viciously attacked Southern Baptists as dangerous.   </p>
<p>One other thing that needs to be done is to attack the basis of Liberal belief and point out that the end of this hateful project won&rsquo;t be some sort of Utopia of world government, peace, and an end to race and racism, that won&rsquo;t happen for thousands of years, if ever.  The only thing this will produce is an end to our culture and nations, stupidly sacrificed to a cloud-cuckoo land vision that will never come about.   China will still be China, Africa will still be Africa, Arabia will still be Arabia, we&rsquo;ll be gone, that&rsquo;s all.    </p>

&#8220;Lest we get too pessimistic, I would like to point out that Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, as well as Turkey, have birth rates similar to the USA, Mexico, France, Ireland, and Scandinavia… about replacement level.&#8221;</p>

Those &#8220;statistics&#8221; don&rsquo;t mean anything.  Birth rates in places like France and Scandinavia are high because of the explosion in immigrant births that&rsquo;s taking place there. Those are not real French babies or Scandinavian babies.  And you&rsquo;re comparing Arab birth rates to Mexico, as if Mexico is an advanced country?  What&rsquo;s that got to do with anything?</p>

<p>NO! it is MURDER of the West by our leaders. AND to olwhitelady, The Moslems consider Christianity to be a religion &ldquo;of the Book&rdquo; and will more likely than not tolerate it. NO! again, the muslims only now &#8220;tolerate&#8221; Christianity because of Saudi and Kuwaiti relationship/dependance on the U.S. which, at the moment, is a mostly Christian country, but that is changing. The muslim ideaology has no room for any other religion whatsoever! There is no room in a muslim world for a non muslim, NONE! except as a slave.</p>

<p>Pretty much the same conclusion that I&rsquo;ve come to. The world wide cabal of liberal elites engage in this deliberate destruction of white people/white civilisation SIMPLY FOR THE SAKE OF DESTRUCTION OF IT. It is some kind of insane revenge motive against anything white. However, there is an old saying addressed to the revenge seeker: dig two graves, not one.</p>

Absolutely!   This is murder plain and simple. Genocide!  Soft and gradual genocide, if you will. But it has nothing to do with &#8220;suicide&#8221;, unless you want to call it &#8220;Assisted Suicide&#8221;.</p>
<p>Those hapless lemmings are being lured and  <i>pushed </i> over the cliff.  They have no idea what&rsquo;s going on, what&rsquo;s in store for them. In the meantime, they think they&rsquo;re promoting &#8220;social justice&#8221; and doing good. But (unfortunately for them) &#8220;doing good&#8221; means getting rid of themselves. It is good for others, maybe, but not for them.</p>

I&rsquo;m skeptical about the true agenda of Wilders and Geller. They are part of a euro-neocon network that disassociates itself from mainstream European Nationalists like the BNP and the FN. They seem to want to be like European version of the GOP, with a neocon foreign policy and acceptance of non-white immigration, so long as the non-whites in question are not Muslims.</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>Exactly!  Anyone with neocon connections must be cut off from any pro-white, pro-US, pro-Europe movement or activity. These people welcome the destruction of the West. They simply want to keep Muslims out because the Muslims know who the neocons are and what they want and can and will attack them. </p>
