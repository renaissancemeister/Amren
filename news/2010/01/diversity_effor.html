<h1><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122329851">Diversity Efforts Uneven in U.S. Companies</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Whitelaw, National Public Radio, January 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The United States is becoming an increasingly diverse nation, but progress in the workplace has been a bit slower.</p>
<p>On one side, there are companies like Xerox, which have gone well beyond making a concerted effort to hire minorities and women.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But for every Xerox, there are many other companies that do little more than pay lip service to the issue of diversity, says Robin Ely, a professor of organizational behavior at Harvard Business School.</p>
<p><b>Moving Beyond the Mandates</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, experts say that most companies, particularly the Fortune 500 firms, are trying to move beyond the legally mandated minimum when it comes to affirmative action and anti-discrimination efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vast majority of them have gotten on the diversity train and aren&rsquo;t going to get off it anytime soon,&#8221; says Eric Peterson, the diversity manager at the Society for Human Resource Management. &#8220;They realize it&rsquo;s necessary for their long-term prosperity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Indeed, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reported a record number of discrimination charge filings in fiscal 2008  &mdash;  some 95,402 nationwide, which marked a 15 percent increase over the previous year.</p>
<p><b>Uneven Progress</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The latest available EEOC statistics show that in 2007, minorities made up 33.4 percent of office and clerical workers  &mdash;  remarkably close to the overall proportion of minorities in the workforce, which is 34.1 percent. But at the executive and senior manager level, minorities represent just 16.6 percent of the total.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The uneven progress among U.S. companies in general reflects the fact that much of the push for diversity was defensive, driven at first by legal requirements about hiring minorities and women. Peterson says that in the 1980s, companies started thinking about it as a values issue, where good employees wanted to work for companies that they were proud of.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>A Change in Culture</b></p>
<p>For some companies that have ambitious diversity programs, it&rsquo;s about reaching certain customers or working in a global economy. Others believe that diverse teams produce the most innovations. Some companies promote diversity in part to help retain the most talented employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true that diversity can have positive effects, but only if we manage it in a creative way to draw out the different experiences people bring to bear from their backgrounds,&#8221; says Thomas Kochan, the co-director of the Institute for Work and Employment Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&rsquo;s Sloan School of Management. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not an automatic kind of thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Managers have learned that it&rsquo;s not enough to bring a wide variety of people into a homogenous corporate culture. Instead, the culture itself often has to change.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But there has been little systematic research into diversity practices in corporate America. Companies tend to closely guard data about minorities and women because of the sensitivity of the issue. Academics say that companies rarely grant them access to the inner workings of their diversity efforts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that the entire topic of diversity, particularly when it comes to race, remains extremely difficult for many people to discuss openly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There is also a concern that America&rsquo;s financial woes could force cash-strapped companies to cut their budgets for diversity programs and training. Firms just starting to invest in diversity often rely on outside trainers to conduct workshops for employees or hold special events to mark a particular group&rsquo;s heritage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>A Journey Without an End</b></p>
<p>Many U.S. companies are too small to support formal diversity programs or devote significant resources to training.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ultimate goal, says Harlow [Phil Harlow, Xerox&rsquo;s chief diversity officer], is that diversity is integrated into the daily functioning of each department and employee at Xerox.</p>
<p>&#8220;By no means do we think we&rsquo;re perfect,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We just happen to have been at it a lot longer than others, so we&rsquo;re a lot further along in the journey. It&rsquo;s really a journey without an end.&#8221;</p>

		<p>LOL! what is lost upon all these &#8220;experts&#8221; is the fact the companies exist first and foremost to deliver a profit to their shareholders.  A quick look at Xerox&rsquo;s 10 year chart shows a precipitous drop in its stock price from a high near 30 to its current price at 8.  Not to mention enormous job cuts <a href="http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/charts/chartdl.aspx?Symbol=US:XRX&amp;&amp;ShowChtBt=Refresh+Chart&amp;DateRangeForm=1&amp;CP=0&amp;PT=8&amp;C9=2&amp;ComparisonsForm=1&amp;CE=0&amp;DisplayForm=1&amp;D4=1&amp;D5=0&amp;D3=0&amp;ViewType=0&amp;PeriodType=8" rel="nofollow">http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/charts/chartdl.aspx?Symbol=US:XRX&&ShowChtBt;=Refresh+Chart&DateRangeForm;=1&CP;=0&PT;=8&C9;=2&ComparisonsForm;=1&CE;=0&DisplayForm;=1&D4;=1&D5;=0&D3;=0&ViewType;=0&PeriodType;=8</a></p>
<p>Is there a correlation to diversity? I think yes.  despite the economic downturn (caused largely by minority housing defaults) any company that increases &#8220;diversity&#8221; typical also has increased problems in customer service, absenteeism, and inompetence.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Part of the problem [of &#8220;little systematic research into diversity practices in corporate America&#8221; and of the tendency of companies  to &#8220;closely guard data about minorities&#8221;] is that the entire topic of diversity, particularly when it comes to race, remains extremely difficult for many people to discuss openly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Social science indicates why diversity makes companies and their employees clam up:   </p>
<p>&#8220;A bleak picture of the corrosive effects of ethnic diversity has been revealed in research by Harvard University&rsquo;s Robert Putnam, one of the world&rsquo;s most influential political scientists. His research shows that the more diverse a community is, the less likely its inhabitants are to trust anyone - from their next-door neighbor to the mayor &hellip;&rdquo; (Financial Times, Oct. 8, 2006)<br>
http://www.ft.com/cms/s/7e668728-5732-11db-9110-0000779e2340.html</p>
<p><br>
Putnam: &ldquo;&hellip;in the presence of diversity, we hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it&rsquo;s not just that we don&rsquo;t trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don&rsquo;t trust people who do look like us.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Prof. Putnam found trust was lowest in Los Angeles, &#8216;the most diverse human habitation in human history&rsquo; &hellip; When the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, they showed that the more people of different races lived in the same community, the greater the loss of trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>Where DO these groups come from?? I suppose that somewhere in their &#8220;portfolio&#8221; they are getting a lot of taxpayer funds too. And YES, hiring these &#8220;diversity&#8221; gurus is in fact a &#8220;never ending journey&#8221; and will never end until all the Whites have been replaced.</p>

		<p>You want more blacks and hispanics in higher positions?  Allow companies to fire incompetents.  That&rsquo;s right, fire incompetents.  By making it impossible to fire minority employees who don&rsquo;t work out you limit the number of slots open to qualified blacks and hispanics.  Companies will carry a certain number of blacks and only advance them so far so they can not hurt the organization too much.  If all the lawsuits were eliminated then companies could weed through the nitwits, get the blacks with potential and nurture them.  Instead you have to hire a black and then hire a white to do his job so you don&rsquo;t have to fire the black.  Why?  Cheaper than a lawsuit!<br>

		<p>As an aside, there has been a noticeable lack of quality in Xerox&rsquo;s physical products and product support recently.  And Xerox is listed here as an enthusiastic supporter of diversity.  Some say there are no such things as coincidences.</p>
<p>Similar to what this article contends, CW states that you have to have a diverse firm to market to a diverse world.  Somehow, the lack of diversity (until recently) at Coca-Cola didn&rsquo;t preclude Coke from being consumed all over the world.  So we are supposed to believe that the only way to get people in Kuala Lumpur and Lima is to have Malaysians and Peruvians as executive VPs of Coca-Cola.  <br>

<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet that by the end of this year that these same companies will have so many problems staying afloat diversity will be the last thing on their minds, as it should be.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be mass business failures in the coming months and I hope it&rsquo;s the ones that have the most diversity.</p>
<p>The commercial real estate market is just now beginning to go belly up, and its losses could amount to about a trillion dollars in a worse case scenario, which is just what a few experts are looking to occur.</p>

		<p>Any company that is gung-ho about diversity will soon be bankrupt. I predicted years ago that the Big 3 automakers would go bankrupt do to diversity. I&rsquo;m predicting Boeing will declare bankruptcy in 5 to 10 years. Boeing already has 4 thousand Black employees out of a work force of 52,000 (scary). They&rsquo;ve been hiring Indian and Chinese engineers instead of White engineers and they&rsquo;ve been outsourcing a lot of their production. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time for Boeing.

<p>If you are honest, guess what, you have just destroyed your career. No wonder whites hunker down and shut-up, good jobs are hard to come by and I&rsquo;m sure that if you cross that boundary, not only will you be fired, but probably ex-communicated from another corporate job for the rest of your life. </p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means do we think we&rsquo;re perfect,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We just happen to have been at it a lot longer than others, so we&rsquo;re a lot further along in the journey. It&rsquo;s really a journey without an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When is Xerox going to relocate their engineering and technical support to New Orleans, Detroit or Gary, Indiana? That would show some serious commitment to diversity. I could see printers that would shame the North Koreans, have the ease of Unix and the security of Microsoft. </p>
<p>What percentage of the minority senior level executives are in areas where they cause the least damage? The statistics show 83% non minority, but do they take into account all the things that go into gaining one of those positions? Starting out as a junior account manager. Being willing and able to move several times. Working those 70 - 80 hour weeks. Going back to school and earning your MBA after putting in those hours. Stepping up to the plate time and time again and not making serious mistakes. Even after all of that, there is little guarantee that you will get one of those positions.  </p>
<p>Speaking of the joys of diversity; my in-laws grew up in Gary, Indiana and left before Richard Hatcher became mayor. My mother-in-law was a teacher for a number of years. One of the things she told me was that in the late 1950&rsquo;s the schools of education were spouting this nonsense about &#8220;having blacks as neighbors will improve your property values&#8221;. We all know what a fine example that Gary has become. I doubt that I would be invited to any neighborhood block parties or BBQ&rsquo;s if I were a resident. </p>

		<p>Language such as : &#8220;Others believe that diverse teams produce the most innovations.&#8221;  reveals things of great import regarding the thinking processes of those who use it. </p>
<p>Why should anybody &#8220;believe&#8221; in the superior innovative capacity of &#8220;diverse teams&#8221;?  <br>
Which teams produce the most innovations is a simple, readily ascertained fact, not subject to anybody&rsquo;s &#8220;belief&#8221;.     </p>
<p>To believe a thing is a an act of faith, unless that belief is based on evidence.  To ignore readily available evidence in preference of promoting one&rsquo;s &#8220;beliefs&#8221; is akin to religious dedication.  </p>
<p>What we see here is the imposition of a sick religion based on hatred of whites.  </p>

		<p>Just this morning I was listening to an NPR show here in NYC called, &#8220;The Takeaway.&#8221;  It is liberal, PC all the way.  The segment on around 6:50 am was about diversity in the workplace.  The discussion was about hiring and race and all that.  While they noted that minority hiring was on the upswing in the upper levels of management, they lamented that it wasn&rsquo;t fast enough.  They even mentioned that in many companies, the share of minorities is equal to their percentage in society, but they also saidthat wasn&rsquo;t good enough.  The a young lady on the NPR staff wastalking about actions companies take to increase &#8216;diversity.&rsquo;  She did a freudian slip!  She said, &#8220;Companies are paying bonuses for race.&#8221;  Then she quickly changed her last word to &#8220;diversity.&#8221;  The other pundits said nothing about her slip and the conversation continued.  I mean it was so true!  The issue is race, and companies will pay bonuses to managers who hire by skin color (or pay bonuses to employees who are non-white, the statement was unclear).</p>
<p>They cannot stand it that there is ever any collective of white people in any way shape or form.  They are maniacal about injecting &#8216;diversity&rsquo; into every last group of more than three white people together they can find.  That is why we will be extinct as a race in 2-3 centuries.</p>

		<p>I own a relocation/real estate enterprise with approximately 730 personnel on full-time employment status.  After decades of making a rather valiant attempt to hire minorities, I&rsquo;ve given up entirely.  After dozens of cases involving theft of company property, theft of company monies, assaults, intoxication, drug use, garnered wages for child support and back taxes, etc, etc&hellip;the pattern has opened my eyes.  All these black problems were with 10% of the workforce which took 90% of HR&rsquo;s time to straighten out but to no avail. As a privately held company with no plans of going public, I&rsquo;ve made it my mission in life to personally screen every single resume and application.  I pride myself with a well run and very profitable organization filled with European and Anglo/Saxon last names and a sea of whiteness.  I even ensure that there is designated parking for those interviewing here so that I may personally see the backs of their vehicles.  Anyone with an &#8220;O&#8221; decal is automatically a non-hire as is that fish symbol with the legs and Darwin inside.  Also that stupid &#8220;Coexist&#8221; sticker is a non-starter too.  I guess one could say that I&rsquo;ve become very discriminating but in a positive sense.  The positives come from a safe, weapons free work place that enjoys morale off the charts.  It&rsquo;s amazing what a little cleaning can do :)</p>

		<p>&#8220;They realize it&rsquo;s necessary for their long-term prosperity.&#8221;  Because getting sued/ prosecuted is bad for prosperity.  In other words, these companies are blackmailed. </p>
<p>At the company I work for, there is an obvious policy of having a certain number of black and Hispanic employees distributed a certain way.  We also have some Asian employees.  Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve noticed (and my bosses and co-workers have certainly noticed it too): it&rsquo;s very difficult to find a good black employee; they usually show a lack of work ethic, a lack of willingness to learn or they end up leaving the company after a little while (more on this later).  The Hispanic employees are, by and large, good workers and easy to get along with.  They stay for a long time - BUT they are all foreign born and they take long breaks.  American born Hispanics are few and not particularly good.  The Asian employees are very hard working, stay for a long time and are eager to learn.  They have a tendency to think they know everything.</p>
<p>Why do decent black workers not stay very long?  It&rsquo;s probably because the push for diversity (in the country at large) has created a huge demand for good black employees.  If you&rsquo;re black and smart and responsible, you can always get a better job elsewhere; you are in very high demand.  This puts certain industries in a quandary.  They cannot pay their black employees more than others for the same work but they must hire/retain them nevertheless - or face legal problems and lawsuits.  The result, right now, is a very high turnover for black employees.  In the end, the company might even get sued for that.  I suspect that they will end up promoting blacks to higher positions after only a short time at the company.  This might already be happening and it will bring bad tidings.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. You have to be careful even around other whites lest they find out you are &#8220;not of the body&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Landrew guide us!  (Thanks, ENwhten.com!)</p>
<p>At the college where I teach we cannot find enough qualified blacks or Hispanics, so we are importing Indians, Koreans and Chinese for teaching jobs.  Yes, we will even hire non-citizens over native-born whites!</p>
<p>The administrators leading diversity initiatives are whites of the hippie generation.  Thanks alot, hippies!  Pot has burned out your brains.</p>

		<p>Forgive me for sounding redundant, but I believe the most important comment on diversity, as well as the &#8220;search for equality&#8221;, equal opportunity or whatever you want to call these leftist mantras, was stated with AM RENS, subtitle to this article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity  &mdash;  journey without an end.&#8221; If Americans of European descent would consider this statement, deeply,they would have an awakening as to its horrible implications  &mdash;  for them. </p>

<p>Because of the actual diversity of whites and their tendancy to think, most of use wouldn&rsquo;t fit into another&rsquo;s definition.  That is what I worry about. What has made the White race great is not desired by White Realists who want to have all whites think just like them, believe just like them, etc.<br>

		<p>Apparently, WalMart is a company that has a real problem with diversity  &mdash;  at least when it comes to protecting the rights of white senior citizens like the 69 year old gentleman who worked as a greeter in the Palm Bay, FL WalMart and got punched in the face by a customer he questioned for setting off the exit alarms with stolen goods  &mdash;  and then got FIRED for protecting himself against his 23 year old assailant. Kudos to store manager Steven Leake and store rep &#8220;Carol&#8221;, who offer nothing more than a blanket &#8220;no comment&#8221; on this outrage. Might be a nice idea to call these two at 321-723-2171 and express your personal opinion on their action.</p>

		<p>Two minutes web browsing yields the following interesting graphs:</p>
<p>Xerox sales (in millions of $, I assume) over the first half of the last decade:</p>
<p><a href="/blog1/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/xeroxsales.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://stockmarketbeat.com/blog1/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/xeroxsales.jpg</a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t imagine they&rsquo;ve been doing better since then, especially not now.</p>
<p>Also, this: Inkjet Printer market share from 2006</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theamericanconsumer.org.php5-9.websitetestlink.com/images/inkjet1.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.theamericanconsumer.org.php5-9.websitetestlink.com/images/inkjet1.gif</a></p>
<p>Xerox is buried in that little wedge marked &#8220;Other&#8221;.</p>
<p>With a little more effort, Xerox may achieve levels of diversity comparable to People&rsquo;s Express Airlines, The American Motors Corporation, and Enron.</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; Others believe that diverse teams produce the most innovations&hellip; Some companies promote diversity in part to help retain the most talented employees&hellip;. They (corporations) realize it&rsquo;s necessary for their long-term prosperity&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I defy any of these so-called &#8216;diversity enforces&rsquo; to prove that &#8216;diverse teams produce the most innovations&rsquo;, helps retain &#8216;the most talented employees&rsquo; and that &#8216;diversity is necessary for prosperity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is Orwellian new-speak  &mdash;  how akin is &#8216;Diversity is Our Strength!&rsquo; to Orwell&rsquo;s &#8216;Ignorance is Strength!&rsquo;?</p>
<p>These Kommissars  are are government-backed (always remember, government = force), unassailable thugs ensuring that the government&rsquo;s anti-White NWO agenda is enforced.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that I am forced to work with utterly unqualified non-Whites in the name of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; ;there is little to nothing I can do about this in the current White-hating reign of terror without risking my livelihood and pension.  </p>
<p>However,  I am tired of being treated rudely or dismissively by non-Whites in companies or organizations with whom I must do business  &mdash;  and I strongly feel that I am treated this way because I am White.  At least there is something, however small, I can do about this.</p>
<p>Any White who lives in California can tell you what it&rsquo;s like to deal with surly, non-White clerks every day in such places as the supermarket, the bank, DMV, hardware store, mall stores, restaurants and more.</p>
<p>Writer Alex Kurtic suggests  &#8220;doing your bit by engaging in guerrilla economics.&#8221;</p>
<p>He writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Large businesses are more vulnerable than you think, and their awesome size is as much a liability as it is an asset for them. </p>
<p>[U]se the companies&rsquo; own feedback forms to tell them why you were not happy with their customer service (but avoid any racial angle).</p>
<p>They know that without customers&rsquo; wallets, they are nothing&hellip;Some companies need only receive as few as ten letters of complaint on a given issue to start paying attention&hellip;. Let this be yet another front on which we wage our culture war&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>When I am treated rudely in any business, I do not hesitate to fill out the company&rsquo;s feedback form  &mdash;  either on-line or via their own pre-addressed/stamped postcards.  I make a point of telling them which of their competitors I will now patronize and that neither I nor any member of my family will ever spend a penny in their business or use their services again due to the way we were treated as customers.   I mention how much easier it is to make purchases on-line so I don&rsquo;t have to deal with their hostile clerks.</p>
<p>Businesses in California are already hurting and hanging on by a thread due to onerous regulations, taxes, a business un-friendly legislature, and a large, poor underclass.  The number of shuttered businesses around here is astonishing  &mdash;  shuttered and empty for two years.</p>
