<h1>Sweden Rattled by Somali Militants in Its Midst</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Karl Ritter, AP, January 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ten subway stops from downtown Stockholm is &#8220;little Mogadishu,&#8221; a drab suburb of the Swedish capital where radical Islamists are said to be recruiting the sons of Somali immigrants for jihad in the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>Police and residents say about 20 have joined al-Shabab, an al-Qaida-linked group waging a bloody insurgency against Somalia&rsquo;s government, and many of them came from the suburb of Rinkeby  &mdash;  the heart of Sweden&rsquo;s Somali community. According to SAPO, the Swedish state security police, five of them have been killed and 10 are still at large in Somalia.</p>
<p>The issue has gained notice at a time of worsening fears of Islamic radicalism in the Scandinavian countries, home to more than 40,000 Somalis who have fled their war-ravaged homeland. These fears sharpened with the Jan. 1 attack by a Somali immigrant in Denmark on a cartoonist who caricatured the Prophet Muhammad.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a small group but they have power,&#8221; said Abadirh Abdi Hussein, a 25-year-old hip-hop artist and &#8220;110-percent Muslim&#8221; who has become the best known Somali in Rinkeby because of his campaign to counter al-Shabab&rsquo;s influence. &#8220;People don&rsquo;t speak up against them. They don&rsquo;t dare.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Sweden, police say they can do little to stop them leaving for Somalia unless they can prove that they are conspiring to commit terrorism. Unlike the U.S., Sweden has not put al-Shabab on any terrorism list.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Experts say the Somali community is especially vulnerable to extremist influence because it&rsquo;s the least integrated immigrant group in Scandinavia. Since the 1990s, more than 25,000 have come to Sweden, 17,000 to Norway and about 10,000 to Denmark.</p>
<p>Denmark&rsquo;s intelligence service says the ax-wielding man who was shot and wounded by Danish police after breaking into cartoonist Kurt Westergaard&rsquo;s home was an al-Shabab-linked Somali with a Danish residence permit. In December a Danish man of Somali descent killed 24 people in a suicide bombing in Mogadishu.</p>
<p>Somali community leaders in Scandinavia say support for al-Shabab has dropped in recent years as people have become aware of its increasingly violent tactics and extreme fundamentalism.</p>
<p>Still, the Somali National Organization in Sweden, an umbrella group, has invited government leaders to address Somalis about how to steer youth away from the extremists.</p>
<p>Sweden&rsquo;s center-right government announced last week that it will study how local authorities here and elsewhere in Europe are tackling extremism.</p>
<p>Integration Minister Nyamko Sabuni, herself an immigrant from Burundi, acknowledged the problem has been poorly understood in Sweden. &#8220;Local officials and politicians working in these areas don&rsquo;t always have the knowledge needed,&#8221; she told AP.<br>

		<p>al-Shabab seems like it&rsquo;s doing good work, helping to return young Somalis to their homeland, where they are clearly more happy and where they can fight for a cause they believe in.  It&rsquo;s certainly better to have them fighting in Somalia than &#8220;enriching&#8221; Swedish society.</p>

<p>How particularly laughable and peculiarly Swedish!</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they just take a page from Karl Gunnar Myrdal&rsquo;s screeds, and &ldquo;integrate&rdquo; the problem out of existence through miscegenation?</p>
<p>It was supposed to solve the &ldquo;American Dilemma&rdquo; after all, in regard to our lack of &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; race relations. So, why not the same with regard to Somali terrorists?</p>
<p>In fact, why not really solve the problem and deport all the Swedes to Somalia for multicultural terrorism solutions, via interracial hybrid experiments there? Then the UN could humanely send all the Haitians to Sweden, as an act of re-affirmative replacement in a now depopulated land. </p>
<p>It all makes sense to me and Tiger Woods too!</p>

		<p>I used to have sympathy for the Swedes when I read these stories about Islamic immigration wrecking the country, but I don&rsquo;t anymore.  Sweden is probably the most feminized, emasculated country in the world.  It is also probably the most left-liberal country in the world (although China and Cuba are communist states, the people in those countries hardly hold liberal values) and the amount of self-hating political correctness emanating from that country would make a Harvard professor look like Rush Limbaugh.</p>
<p>Islamic immigration might be good for Sweden, like how shock treatment was used to treat ailments despite the pain it caused.  Maybe if they are exposed to an alien Third World culture, they will harden up and act more like their Geatish ancestors rather than a nation of 9 million San Franciscans.</p>

		<p>British internal security [MI5] lists the Somali immigrant or refugee or illegal as the # 1 security threat. Of the men, 10 % can field strip an AK in less than a minute blindfolded, AND NONE OF THEM HAVE CONVENTIONAL MILITARY TRAININGT!! NOT only that, but they have an amazingly high propensity for violence, fighting to kill for almost no absolute reason that can be discerned. Be very, very careful around these folks. That is all.</p>

Ah yes, but yet ANOTHER African hip-hop &#8220;artist&#8221; enlightening Europe. Do any of these parasites acually CONTRIBUTE anything to Europe. I would imagine that this &#8220;110% muslim&#8221; [ question: why are you living in SWEDEN  then ] is in bed with these radical Islamists, how else would HE get by with speaking out. He just does it with a smile -you know how Whites just LOVE &#8220;non-threatening&#8221; minorities.</p>
<p>the heart of Sweden&rsquo;s Somali community.<br>
Talk about the twilite zone. Swedens forfathers are rolling in their graves. Why is it that you never hear &#8220;the heart of Somalias Swedish community?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sweden&rsquo;s center-right government announced last week that it will study how local authorities here and elsewhere in Europe are tackling extremism.<br>
What&rsquo;s there to STUDY you twits, round them up and throw them out!   </p>

		<p>&#8220;Ten subway stops from downtown Stockholm is &ldquo;little Mogadishu,&rdquo; a drab suburb of the Swedish capital where radical Islamists are said to be recruiting the sons of Somali immigrants for jihad in the Horn of Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Mogadishu!&#8221;  What a horror to Swedes of a few years ago it would have been to see what third world evil has been invited to their shores by sick, twisted minds.</p>
<p>But the propaganda merchants are still wailing out their diversity message full force, oblivious to all the failures throughout Europe, Australia, and the US where diversity is threatening to sink them into a morass of conflicts, as Western economies continue to crumble.</p>
<p>One expert trends forecaster, Gerald, Celente, www.trendsresearch.com, is forecasting a SEVERE backlash of immigration everywhere, and maintains it is developing to the point where immigrants are going to be rounded up and shipped home eventually, as the economy continues to deteriorate and jobs get more and more scarce.  He says that Italy is just the first example.  There will be much more of that kind of heated backlash by the people who are harmed by these encrouchers.</p>
<p>However, I would be suprised if this forecast of his comes true, but let me add that I was surprised to see the Italians act with the outrage they did, when they expelled the crime prone blacks from their towns, so perhaps he&rsquo;s going to be correct once again.  He&rsquo;s been right so many times, quite frankly, I&rsquo;m disinclined to scoff at anything he says.  He spends a lot of time and money studying many various socio-economic factors, including military ones, that I doubt that there&rsquo;s a better informed group on the planet.<br>

		<p>The fact is that no sane White country would ever allow to enter (let alone import) thousands of Somalis or other Africans. Aid to those countries would be the most that sane govenments would provide. Western nations have committed foolish and self destructive acts in the last 1000 years, but nothing equals the demonical idiocy of their present immigration policies.</p>

BK, you may surmise that every nationality, every race and subrace has a character, a style and an ethos.<br>
Sweden had a lot to recommend it, but it also had some tragic flaws. Stoicism gave way to nihlism. peacefulness gave way to muteness, inaction. Belief-total trust in the good intentions of neighbors left them defenseless against the base criminality of third worlders.<br>
I know swedes, some of them are my best friends. Even they admit Swedes are kind of lost. They seem to accept the end of their world with no more than a shrug.<br>
Write them off. They&rsquo;re gone, as a society and a bloodline. The first Lemmings over the cliff.<br>
Sad.</p>

<p>Here in NJ we elected a Republican Governor.  But we reelected all the same Democratic and Republican Assemblymen and State Senators who got us into the mess we&rsquo;re in.  Governor Christie, though I wish him well, will be able to accomplish nothing because the Corzine Democrats and Whitman Republicans still run the show.  Why the poor man wanted the job is beyond me.

<p>Agreed. Sweden actively supported the ANC in the destruction of White-ruled South Africa. The Swedes hardly have a right to object to the social pathologies brought by Africans migrating into the northern climes when they forced the same on White South Africans. Perhaps when the Somalis et alia multiply to the point where they outnumber the indigenous Swedes, the Swedes will understand all the &#8220;joys&#8221; of black majority rule. </p>
