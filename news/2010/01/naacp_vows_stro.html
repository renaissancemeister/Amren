<h1>NAACP Vows Stronger Confederate Flag Fight in S.C.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeffrey Collins, Sun News (Myrtle Beach, South Carolina), January 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The NAACP will make a stronger push to remove the Confederate flag from the grounds of the South Carolina Statehouse, the president of the civil rights organization said Monday.</p>
<p>Benjamin Jealous wouldn&rsquo;t go into details, but said by the summer the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People would bring more publicity to its economic boycott of South Carolina. The campaign calls for blacks to not vacation in the state and spend as little money as they can within its borders.</p>
<p>Jealous was in South Carolina to speak at a rally by the state&rsquo;s NAACP chapter honoring Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>While speakers also discussed education and health care, the rally in South Carolina continues to be entwined with the Confederate flag, which slowly waved in a slight breeze on a 30-foot pole on the front lawn of the Capitol.</p>
<p>It was moved from its perch atop the Capitol dome after the NAACP began holding rallies on the King holiday to protest the flag. For the first rally in 2000, some 50,000 people jammed Statehouse grounds to demand the flag be taken down. The flag was moved months later.</p>
<p>For 40 years, the flag had flown below U.S. and state flags. Supporters said it commemorated the state&rsquo;s valiant fight in the Civil War, while detractors said it was a thumb in the eye of the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>The NAACP didn&rsquo;t support the compromise that displays the flag beside one of Columbia&rsquo;s busiest streets, but there has been little effort to revisit the issue. Jealous hopes to change that in the next few years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. King knew it was put there as an act of intimidation and hatred. Moving it from right up top to smack in front doesn&rsquo;t change things,&#8221; Jealous said. &#8220;In some ways it worsens the problem. You stand there and look at that flag and see how big it is to you and you look up at the American flag and see how small it is.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Blacks are going to boycott South Carolina?  Please don&rsquo;t throw SC into the briar patch.  I wish Missouri would start flying Confederate Battle Flags on its state house dome.  </p>
<p>What this article does not tell you is that the pro-flag rallies were way bigger than the anti-flag minor outbursts.  The coalition of pro-flag orgs would have succeeded in keeping the flag flying above the dome if not for treachery of a certain few people in the coalition.</p>

<p>What an interesting and laughable comment, by the aptly named Comrade Jealous. It would seem that this fool has a case of perspective envy!</p>
<p>Personally, I have come to accept that such ludicrous pronouncements and demands by blacks are both to be expected and welcomed. This demonizing of the Confederate flag as a &ldquo;racist&rdquo; symbol, only works toward destroying multiculturalism as &ldquo;our&rdquo; collective state religion. When politicians bow to this absurdity, it increases the racial awareness of whites in a way that spending $10,000,000 on media oriented toward the same goal just couldn&rsquo;t do. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It is simple, because it demonstrates not a limited conceptual example of our cultural and racial dispossession, but a concrete enforcement of it by the screeching nonwhite rabble and our treasonous &ldquo;elites.&rdquo; Thus, our racial enemies and the cowardly collaborators who wish to &ldquo;appease&rdquo; them win battles, while they also increase the racial consciousness of the beleaguered white majority, that eventually will translate into popular support for race realism, that is going to be needed to ultimately win the greater future war.</p>
<p>In the end, much like the election of the &ldquo;savior,&rdquo; General Secretary Obama did more to help than hurt us, so too does this type of idiocy. It will be interesting to see if this Scott Brown does win that US Senate seat in Massachusetts tonight; while the guy is no real prize to be sure, it will be a seismic rejection of the Multi Cult&rsquo;s overall goals as personified by the &ldquo;hope and change&rdquo; that is General Secretary Osama&rsquo;s &ldquo;transformative&rdquo; revolution.</p>
<p>May God let it be so!</p>

		<p>Wants more blacks to participate in boycott of South Carolina.</p>
<p>Yes, and I&rsquo;m sure the Whites in S.C. want more blacks to boycott also. Maybe the blacks and Whites there can work together to get more blacks to participate. It would be a win-win. The Whites would have less crime, poverty and welfare dependents, and the blacks will have a sense of punishing those &#8220;evil racisss White folk&#8221;. </p>

		<p>The funny thing about this &#8220;boycott&#8221;, which has been going on for 10 years, is that it has had zero negative economic effect.  Ben Jealous, what a name, may talk big but he knows that blacks, even if they were organized, just don&rsquo;t have the economic clout to pressure South Carolina into doing anything.  Maybe instead of fighting a meaningless battle about a piece of cloth, Jealous should concentrate on the horrendous black dropout rate, out of wedlock birth rate, black criminality etc..  </p>

<p>NO way were there 50,000 OR even 500 blacks at this &#8220;rally&#8221; I live in S.C. when I&rsquo;m NOT in Iraq or Afghanistan and when home the last time (Myrtle Beach) the previously 99% white Blvd and beach area, now looked like a ghetto with blacks in groups standing around on the sidewalks, leaning against buildings holding their genitals and hooting at White girls&hellip;.totally disgusting&hellip;the illegals in my home are over running the place too because states which never had illegal problems have no experience dealing with them. The front check out of our local WalMart Super Store looks like a French customs line (all blacks that don&rsquo;t appear to speak English) and the shopping areas look like I am back in Guatemala or Hondo. Like Flaxen-headed Strumpet, I wish the NAACP better luck than they had boycotting the May Memorial Week End black biker week, another exhibition of abysmal conduct by blacks.</p>

		<p>I read that tourism actually increased because of this boycott so the NAACP is actually doing SC a favor.  The state has some wonderful tourist attractions and the weather is very nice but the whole experience is ruined by so many blacks which by the way make up a third of the population.  Less black tourists would be a boon to the area.  Perhaps they could fly a few Confederate Flags over their malls?</p>

<p>I wish they boycott Europe. Blacks were never able to make pressure without their massive number. No matter, where they won, they won because they were many and the lefts helped them. That was thousand years ago like that an today its still the same.</p>
<p>Africa is 3 times a big as Europe and hast more people - but economicly has nothing. They have no any financial power to say anything.<br>
If Germany alone boycotts whole Africa, it will be a financial catastrophy - FOR AFRICA. <br>

		<p>Don`t waste your time talking common sense, history,or economics; pandering trumps all. It would be like a Democratic fund raiser in Miami Beach not talking about Farkhan or Hamas.I never attended a single fund raiser south of Vero Beach where the threat of Arab expansionism was not beat to death.<br>
     The Confederate battle Flag is to democratic black race hustlers as West bank settlement protection is to democratic Jewish money hustlers.The biggest black event anywhere in America occurs in Myrtle Beach. It is a black motorcycle week end that puts  pot bellied white drunks on Harleys to shame. I doubt if South Carolina could stand not having 50,000 bikers who spend a tenth of what white bikers do storm the Beach every year.<br>

		<p>What blacks just can&rsquo;t seem to get is Whites could care less if blacks don&rsquo;t participate, in fact most Whites would prefer it.It seems as if the main drive for blacks is not finding an honest job or creating anything of value NO their main interest seems to be invading places where they are not wanted and ruining the traditions of anyone who is not a black. blacks needs to recognize that they did not revolt for their freedom, over one half million Whites died in the Civil War to give them their freedom as a gift. blacks need to be thanking Whites, not bad mouthing them at every opportunity. blacks also would be wise to understand that had their long lost relatives not been slaves because when the black tribes sold other blacks into slavery the ones that were not sold were killed, meaqning they would not even be here to spit in the face of their White Saviours.</p>

		<p>The only blacks that will boycott SC are the black elites, like Jackson, Sharpton and their comrades,as I noticed, personally when the flag flap was first brewing.  </p>
<p>I was at the Paramount Carowinds Amusement Park, which sits on the border of North Carolina and South Carolina.  As I stood in line for the roller coaster ride, which actually sits on the South Carolina half, there was a black couple in front of us in line.  We started chatting as we waited patiently for our turn and much to my husband&rsquo;s chagrin, I asked the black couple how come they weren&rsquo;t boycotting the amusement park as Jesse Jackson had asked African Americans to do.  The husband&rsquo;s response was that they were interested in having fun and the fight over a flag wasn&rsquo;t going to stop them.  These weren&rsquo;t black elitist.  Just a regular black couple, out for the day at an amusement park to have some fun, in a park that happened to be in South Carolina.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, it is obvious to A LOT of people, that despite the protestations of Jackson, Sharpton and their ilk,  should every black in South Carolina and the entire country, decide to boycott the state, I would doubt that the state would suffer much.</p>

<p>  Good point. I have relatives who live in South Carolina and have visited them for nearly forty years. I&rsquo;ve seen absolutely no impact from this so called boycott. During Black Biker weekend in Myrtle the restaurant and shop owners hunker down, almost as if they&rsquo;re under siege. The cops are everywhere in overwhelming numbers as well. This flag boycott is a total flop.</p>

		<p>Just outside of Tampa is the world&rsquo;s largest Confederate Battle flag.  It is on private land and just about overhangs the Southern lanes of I-75.  This flag is also part of a monmument to those during the Civil War who answered the call and died for freedom.  As one way to defeat the racist NAACP, private land can be used to create honorable monmuments to those who sought freedom.  There are several in Florida and more being planned.</p>

<p>HEYYYYYY Charles! I am one of those Harley riders and I assure you, I AM NOT POT BELLIED NOR am I a drunk! The Harley Week is far less trouble in Myrtle Beach than the college spring break and nothing near the trash, ill manners, disrespect and overall conduct of the black bikers which has even been criticized by the black residents of Myrtle Beach.</p>

		<p>This may interest the Amren reader.  I am from South Carolina.  I know that the average black here doesn&rsquo;t care about the flag issue and watches the NAACP controversy with amused interest.  Outside of the extreme poverty of the I95 corridor, most blacks here live in relative comfort.  In fact, SC has the highest number of middle to upper income blacks in the nation.  They have more things to worry about than a fight over a relic flying on the State House grounds.</p>

		<p>From a Yankee,<br>
I have always had the utmost respect for the South. They lost a hard fought war, a war that cost them lives, money, land and it split families apart. They are more American then &#8220;Race Hustlers&#8221;. If I was a Southerner I would fly the &#8220;Stars and Bars&#8221; all the time. IMHO, they have earned the right to fly their flag. I wish If I raised it here in California, it would have them same effect.</p>

		<p>I never said that they are the majority of blacks.  Most of them are poor.  But they don&rsquo;t care about the flag debate.  The point is that SC is a comfortable place for them to live, wealthy or not, and do not pay much attention to the debate.</p>

		<p>This nation was born by dissent and rebellion. The state versus federal question had intelligent law abiding advocates on both sides. Lee.. a man of conscience, was Lincoln&rsquo;s first pick, yet Lee stayed with his own roots as he could not stay out of the frey or go against the particular culture that reared him. This still is one nation fortunately but to deny any validity to the southern cause is unjust. Likewise to deny the great efforts of those that fought for what they deemed just along with the flag of its memory seems unjust. The blacks that mind this flag might want to remember, if their own race hadn&rsquo;t prostituted their own brethren to us&hellip;this nation would not have suffered that war, nor would there have been the remarkable amount off black on white crime or costs to maintain disfunctional blacks.</p>
