<p>(El Paso, TX)  &mdash;  National Latino Congreso (NLC) will be holding a Media Breakfast during the NLC on Friday, January 29, 2010 at 10:00 AM in the Camino Real Braham Room.</p>
<p>During the event, members of the media will respond to the President&rsquo;s State of Union Speech on issues of health care, jobs, mortgage foreclosures, climate change, census, immigration reform, Latin America, and the MiddleEast wars.</p>
<p>Subsequently NLC delegates will launch an advocacy agenda representing tens of millions of Latinos from across America.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s &#8220;Congreso&#8221; serves as a Call to Action that will focus on developing strategies around enacting federal legislation on:<br>
 * Justice for immigrants;<br>
 * Climate change mitigation and adaptation;<br>
 * Economic stimulus to create jobs and save homes.</p>
<p>Other issues like the upcoming US Census, border violence, health care, drug policy reform, the Middle East wars, and U.S.-Latin America relations may also be heard.</p>
<p>The NLC comes at a crucial time as Latino unemployment approaches 20%, nearly 2 million Latinos have been foreclosed, and 12 million super-exploited undocumented immigrants  &mdash;  mostly Latinos- suffer in our midst without rights or justice.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The NLC comes at a crucial time as Latino unemployment approaches 20%, nearly 2 million Latinos have been foreclosed,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Latino&#8221; employment is about thirty-percent right now&hellip;&hellip;.MINIMUM?  If illegal aliens are included the unemployment rate will be even greater still.</p>
<p>Remember people working part time and those who are out of the labor pool, because of LONG TERM UNEMPLOYMENT make today&rsquo;s rate&hellip;overall&hellip;.17.5%, not 10%.  And, if I put another strain upon everybody, let me inform you that the true rate is even higher than that:  People who seriously study the situation are saying AT LEAST 30 million people are out of work!  That&rsquo;s about 20% of the entire working population in the United States.</p>
<p>The economy is going to stagnate along for a while with the stimulus money bumping up the growth rate a bit, but the government infusion of cash is about to run out.  </p>
<p>It WILL get worse.  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a shame if these racist Hispanic groups lose their funding and become defunct?</p>

		<p>Quote..&#8221;12 million super-exploited undocumented immigrants &mdash; mostly Latinos..&#8221;..unquote. How do they know? How do they count undocumented people, especially considering that math is not a particular strong point with Latinos. What&rsquo;s the difference between &#8216;exploited&rsquo; and &#8216;super-exploited&rsquo;? Do the latter zoom all over the sky faster than a speeding bullet, wear capes and change in telephone booths? 2.4 million unemployed? So who is employing the other 9.6 million undocumented Latinos? Perhaps they are all zooming around, so fast we don&rsquo;t notice them. Mind you, if they really did move fast, they wouldn&rsquo;t be unemployed for long. We could use a few in UK to sort and deliver our mail, the union at the post office seems to have a phobia about that.</p>

		<p>It is the taxpaying American citizens who are &#8220;super-exploited&#8221; by the employers who hire Hispanic illegals and the politicians who treat the criminal Hispanic illegals like family.  </p>
<p>We are the ones who have our jobs, identities and affordable housing stolen ny the criminal Hispanic illegals .  </p>
<p>We are the ones who are forced to subsidize housing, education, medical care and welfare benefits for the criminal Hispanic illegals .  </p>
<p>We are the ones who die on our highways annualy by the thousands at the hands of the unlicensed and uninsured the criminal Hispanic illegals .  </p>
<p>It is we American citizens who are &#8220;super-exploited&#8221; and we have had about all of this nonsense we&rsquo;re going to tolerate&hellip;</p>

		<p>Whites have become the most delusional people with regard to race and control of this nation and even control of our lifes. A blind spot is an understatement that a group(s) like this even exist without a white counterpart? What do people think will really happen with racial political gains, power structures and control when Hispanics become a majority?</p>

		<p>To them &#8220;justice&#8221; means wealth equalization.  In all fairness, they are not the first generation of Americans who immigrated here and got ahead through labor rackateering, political cronyism, nepotism, &#8220;poverty programs&#8221; and, in general, taking wealth from established Americans.  It&rsquo;s the same old Marxist whine of the 20th century.</p>
