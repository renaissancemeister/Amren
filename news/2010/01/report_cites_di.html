<h1>Report Cites Disparity in CMS Spending</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ann Doss Helms, Charlotte Observer, January 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Per-pupil spending is highest in Charlotte-Mecklenburg&rsquo;s small, high-poverty schools and lowest in large suburban ones, a report released Tuesday shows.</p>
<p>The school board heard a staff report designed to gauge whether students in high-poverty schools are getting an equal shot at a good education. The report looks at such measures as extracurricular activities, faculty credentials, technology and library books.</p>
<p>Following up on a discussion at a weekend retreat, many said they need to figure out a better way of measuring results.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re meeting the standards on so many of these issues, yet we&rsquo;re still not meeting the student achievement goals,&#8221; said board member Rhonda Lennon. &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter how many widgets and gidgets and gadgets are in the school. It matters what we&rsquo;re doing with the students.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 2010 report, which is posted on the district&rsquo;s Web site, will provide information for parents who are trying to choose 2010-11 assignments. It lists details on all schools, regardless of poverty level.</p>
<p>The report indicates CMS is meeting most of its goals and making progress toward the others. However, the higher-poverty schools remain less likely to offer a full slate of activities, such as chess, Odyssey of the Mind or Battle of the Books.</p>
<p>They also have teachers with lower average time on the job and fewer advanced degrees, and have significantly fewer teachers with National Board Certification.</p>
<p>Superintendent Peter Gorman says research shows teacher experience and advanced degrees have little effect on student achievement, but CMS students with board-certified teachers outperform peers with teachers who don&rsquo;t hold that credential.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And member Tom Tate said that since CMS has never provided the high-poverty schools an equal level of experienced teachers with advanced degrees, he&rsquo;s not convinced that isn&rsquo;t part of the problem. Gorman said next month he&rsquo;ll present Harvard University research on CMS students that will provide more detail on what makes a difference.</p>
<p>The report breaks down per-pupil spending for 2008-09. (Because the current year isn&rsquo;t over, those numbers aren&rsquo;t in yet).</p>
<p>The average was $6,156 per elementary student, $5,624 per middle-school student and $5,836 per high-school student. The elementary figures include some schools that have Bright Beginnings prekindergarten classes; CMS spends an average of $8,000 per child at its pre-K centers.</p>
<p>Many small, high-poverty schools were thousands above average  &mdash;  almost $12,500 at the alternative Hawthorne High and almost $11,000 at Shamrock Elementary.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Schools where at least 75 percent of kids are poor get extra federal Title I money.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Community House, a south suburban middle school with almost 1,500 students, had the lowest per-pupil cost, under $4,300.</p>
<p>Lennon and Kaye McGarry said CMS should start looking at other factors that influence student success, including absenteeism and parent involvement.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s clearly not the dollars,&#8221; Lennon said.<br>

For years, blacks have claimed that their children did poorly because their schools weren&rsquo;t funded as well as those in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Here in Buffalo, Buffalo public schools pay more for per student than the schools in the suburbs and the black failure rate last year was reported to be 53%.</p>
<p>No one raises the issue anymore. The new issue is that we need &#8216;regionalism&rsquo; so that black kids can attend suburban schools.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s never been about the money.  As a former &#8220;educator&#8221; I can tell you that we got tons of extra money because we were a Title I school, and it made not one whit of difference.  What does make a difference is:  (a) kids whose mothers were well-nourished during pregnancy; (b) kids who were properly nourished in the first 5 years of life; (c) parents who put a HIGH priority on education; (d) parents who discipline their kids and have high behavioral standards set for them; (e) administrators who don&rsquo;t test the students every other week or so and have it count towards end-of-the-year scores; (f) teachers who are not exhausted by the never-ending reams of paperwork required for &#8220;documentation&#8221; of student progress; and (g)parents who show up to volunteer their time to help the kids in various areas.  These things are SO necessary, and most of the time SO absent in low-performing schools - all the money in the world will not make up for the lacks in the areas aforementioned.</p>

		<p>I guess the only way a black student can learn if he/she is sitting next to a white student form higher economic stratum.  <br>
This is a joke; I am an educator in the 8th largest public school district in the USA.  The complaining from the &ldquo;black community&rdquo; has only increased over the years; the more concessions are made the more the blacks want.  Public education in the USA is a fraud.  The curriculum gets &ldquo;dumbed down&rdquo; year after year so the &ldquo;economically disadvantaged&rdquo; don&rsquo;t lose self esteem.  In the end, as a society we continue to lower the bar and use words like &ldquo;inclusiveness&rdquo; or &ldquo;empowerment&rdquo; to make the people feel better about losing our competitive edge as a nation.  No one in public education will face the truth; the truth that different people have different natural abilities or that there could ever be (God forbid) a difference between the races.  Just mentioning the idea is grounds for termination in my field.<br>

		<p>Same old tired excuses. What they are not telling you folks is that these schools are in predominately black neighborhoods, aka &#8220;high poverty&#8221; areas. That last paragraph was a bit shocking though. They seem to have reached the conclusion that money isn&rsquo;t the problem. FINALLY&hellip;</p>

<p>Perhaps this is because those in public education want to STAY in their jobs to retirement, as most who are racially aware should be about to retire now. We all know, at this moment in time, a criticism of blacks is a career killer though some are indeed awakening to reality.</p>

		<p>Skip, #8:  I WANTED to stay in my teaching job until I retired, but what was happening there was so sickening to me that I literally had to quit 5 or more years before I would have retired because my health went down the terlit.  I am better now; but that job almost killed me.  My friends had privately decided who would chip in for the casket.  I&rsquo;m lucky to still be here.  YES I&rsquo;m racially aware; and the lying and denying going on in the public school systems in America would do credit to a practicing alcoholic!!  (I&rsquo;m in AA also - we alkies lie and deny to the max when drinking/using).  So until the school systems get sober - don&rsquo;t choose education as a career.  You just might not live through it.</p>
