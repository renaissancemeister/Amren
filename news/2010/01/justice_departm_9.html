			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Megerian, NJ.com, January 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New Jersey&rsquo;s civil service test for police officers seeking a promotion to sergeant discriminates against African-American and Hispanic candidates, according to a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice Thursday.</p>
<p>Even African-Americans and Hispanics who pass the multiple-choice test are less likely to receive promotions because their scores are lower, according to the 10-page lawsuit filed against the state and the Civil Service Commission. The suit seeks to block the state from using the test.</p>
<p>At least 120 municial and county police departments in New Jersey have used the discriminatory system from 2000 to 2008, according to Department of Justice spokesman Alejandro Miyar.</p>
<p>Eighteen of the state&rsquo;s 20 largest cities and townships, including Newark, use the same test.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Department of Justice is arguing the state has violated Title VII, which prohibits employment discrimination, because it hasn&rsquo;t proved that the test, which some departments require for promotions to sergeant, is an essential tool for determing fitness for the job.</p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2008, 89 percent of the white candidates who took the test passed it, compared to 73 percent of African-American candidates and 77 percent of Hispanic candidates, the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>&#8220;For whatever reason, the test as it currently exists has a disparate impact,&#8221; Miyar said. &#8220;We don&rsquo;t have a problem with the use of a written test, but if the state wishes to do so it must not have a disparate impact.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Have the police union, better yet the minority members of the police union, devise a non-discriminatory test.  Good luck.</p>
<p>The key question should not be color, as any statisticians will tell you the results mean something.  And likely the something has to do with items other than race.  Like IQ tests, are the tests predictative of future success?  And is success correctly defined?  If so then discrimination is not an issue, although race maybe if that race either doesn&rsquo;t have the abilities or inclination to learn those professional skills.  Gee you would think some academic could write a learned paper on how do design a test that favors whites.  And if so then how to favor other ethnic groups.</p>

		<p> The reason tests are given is to pick the most qualified candidate for the job.If person &#8220;A&#8221; scores 90% and  person &#8220;B&#8221; score 75% the 90% score should be chosen. AA has not raised the minority&rsquo;s standards, only lower the whites.</p>

		<p>I always thought that the people who passed the test with the highest scores would get the promotion regardless of color. There is something wrong when whites and asians can pass the test because they studied for it and blacks cannot pass the test and they want the jobs that should go to the those who passed the test with the highest scores.</p>

		<p> If they dumb down the tests that just means that whites and Asians will kill the blacks on the tests and if to be fair they use ebonics and ghetto slang the white officers will still pass overwhelmingly and the Asians will suit for rightful discrimination.</p>

		<p> Thomas Perez, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division is bringing this case without even a suggestion that the test discriminates because of race. <br/>
That is always implied as a given in suits of this kind. IT&rsquo;S A KNOWN fact that blacks do not do as well as whites in most bar exams, is that grounds for other lawsuits? Perez  does not seem to have a clue, he is just on a mission as is his boss Eric Holder.<br/>

		<p>In the full article the assistant Attorney General states that he wants to make sure that &#8220;victims of such practices are made whole.&#8221; </p>
<p>This is just a way to transfer wealth and power to blacks and hispanics by giving them money and promotions, both undeserved.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to suspect that some of the leftists in power are not as dumb as they pretend to be; surely some of them are beginning to comprehend the validity of race and that the races do not have equal average I.Q.&rsquo;s.

		<p>I want to be an M.D. <br/>
But I&rsquo;m not really equipped to get through med school, and the other myriad hoops after school. Those things would take too much time, money, effort, brain-melting study, memory retention, and, yes, INTELLIGENCE. <br/>
 I know plenty of MDs and PhDs (and some of them are decidedly unwise), but they mostly are intelligent. They can sort and retain information long enough to spit it out on a test,and that&rsquo;s the fact.<br/>
They&rsquo;re better equipped to do that stuff than I.<br/>
Well, I&rsquo;m in a huge class of intelligent people who work hard, but, alas, cannot obtain MDs and PhDs under the current system&hellip;because we&rsquo;re white.<br/>
If we were &#8220;minority&#8221; (AKA part of the roughly 93% of the world&rsquo;s population, which is brown), we might be given a hand up throughout the entire advanced degree and hiring process.<br/>
What a bizarre world we live in.</p>

		<p>You can hire based on standards, or race, but not both, because blacks and hispanics consistently score much lower than whites on all tests of mental ability.</p>
<p>Once you decide to deny this simple and obvious fact, were compelled to engage in a bewildering variety of incredibly strange and socially destructive practices.</p>

<p>Lawyers who deal with the affirmative action legislation definitely know that races aren&rsquo;t equally intelligent.

		<p>Interesting concept. We don&rsquo;t object to a test for applicants as long as everyone scores the same.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that firefighting is approached differently by various racial and ethnic groups and that all such differences are, at bottom, irrelevant.  </p>

		<p>Forgive me for being blunt, but I think the only way such written tests could really deliberately discriminate against Blacks and Latinos (not the same thing as Hispanics, by the way), is if they were actually I.Q. tests.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I say, if a Black or Latino, by working hard, can get a good grade or score on a written test, hell, that should prove they would perform adequately in said job.</p>
<p>To discard all test scores, because Whites, over the while, did better than non-Whites, like what was done recently in Connecticut (with the blessing of wise Latina Sotomayor) in a Fire department, I think THAT is blatant discrimination.</p>

		<p>All written tests discrimnate against stupid and lazy people regardless of race. I am a lazy white guy therefore when I take the test I don&rsquo;t get a high score because I fail to study.  I am also stupid and even if I study I still can&rsquo;t pass the test.</p>
<p>For WHATEVER reason, I just can&rsquo;t pass the test, so it must be the fault of the test writers. Just because I can&rsquo;t pass the test, why should I be denied the job? It&rsquo;s not my fault, I am a victim of laziness and stupidity.</p>

How come employment tests never have a disparate impact against whites  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  - Oh but they do . Just what do you think the aptitude test that first began showing up in the late sixties were all about ? Whoever is in charge decides whether or not you pass or fail.That is why you will never be allowed to see your  your errors. Because it would give you grounds to contest their decision . What do you think the illogical concept of test that have,&#8221;no correct or incorrect answers,&#8221; is all about anyway ?  If minorities are in charge and eventually they will be one way or the other, you can bet your bottom dollar some poor white looking for work will lose out to AA and I don&rsquo;t mean al-anon . I&rsquo;ve had it happen to me at least once that I know of with a major corporation in the South . The personnel manager who was black, told me in so many words that is exactly what happened in my case . I had refused to accept that I had failed a test unless they showed me, which of course they woudn&rsquo;t.His very words, &#8221; All I can tell you is that it is now being contested in the courts.&#8221; That statement could not have possibly meant anything except AA . The possibility of it happening to you goes up exponentially as the minority population goes up .You live in a region that is 85% white, the chances of your running into it are slim . If you live in a region where whites are the minority, chances are you will experience it  &mdash;  -brutally.</p>

		<p>&#8220;New Jersey&rsquo;s civil service test for police officers seeking a promotion to sergeant discriminates against Afro-American and Hispanic candidates&#8221;.  That is a statement that should be challenged in court by asking exactly what questions and how many are indeed discrimiatory and racist and should be proven beyond any reasonable doubt that they are.  Failure to do so should result in a counter law suit for wasting the courts time and using false and slanderous statements. This rediculous scam that is spreading throughout this country in order to protect incompetent and lazy people has got to stop. Hard working, tax paying American citizens deserve better.        </p>

		<p>The whole idea behind these endless challenges to tests is that if you can&rsquo;t pass the test, then there must be something deficient about the test   &mdash;  - not that maybe there&rsquo;s something deficient with YOU.</p>
<p>As always, they are passing the blame and not accepting personal responsibility for their own performance.</p>

		<p>Remember whose justice department this is.  The questions of the genetic contribution to IQ as well as the fact that blacks consistently score at least one standard deviation below whites has been well established for decades now.  The overwhelming evidence also indicates that the genetic contribution to IQ is between 60-80% and that of all the factors that predict socioeconomic success cognitive ability far and away is the most important.  Any test that produced equal scores for blacks and whites would be seriously flawed and designed to favor the blacks.<br/>
None of this is new but that doesn&rsquo;t prevent our liberal brethren from doing everything in their power to either deny or ignore it.  It is Thomas Sowell&rsquo;s vision of the anointed phenomenon.  There is no possible world or society in which white and black test scores will be consistently equal so long as the tests are highly G-loaded,i.e. test cognitive ability.</p>
