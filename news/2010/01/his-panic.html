<p>{snip} While fears of perceived racial insensitivity may force many critics to choose their words carefully, widespread belief that Hispanics have high or perhaps very high crime rates seems to exist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If we examine the data in the most recent 2008 BJS [Bureau of Justice Statistics] report, published in December 2009, we discover the total Hispanic incarceration rate, while far below that of blacks, is still almost 150 percent above the white average, having fallen a little from the 170 percent figure in 2000. {snip}</p>
<p>The traditional liberal explanation for this would be that Hispanics are considerably poorer than whites, that poverty and racism cause crime, and that a white-dominated criminal justice system is likely to be biased against suspects of a darker hue. {snip}</p>
<p>The most obvious of these [factors] are age and gender. An overwhelming fraction of serious crime is committed by the young, young males in particular. This has been the case throughout recorded history and remains true everywhere in today&rsquo;s world. Almost all American crimes are committed by individuals aged 15-44, with the age range 18-29 representing the sharp peak of criminal activity. Also, the 14-to-1 ratio of males to females in the U.S. prison system provides a sense of just how heavily crime is a male phenomenon; for violent offenses, the ratio is even higher.</p>
<p>And as it happens, the age distribution in America for Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites is quite different. The median age for Hispanics is around 27, near the absolute peak of the prime-crime age range. But the median white age is over 40, putting nearly half the white population above the likely age range for committing crimes. While it is certainly true that Hispanic 23-year-olds have much greater criminal tendencies than white 45-year-olds, a more useful question is the relative criminality of Hispanics and whites of the same age. Also, many Hispanics are immigrants, and since immigrants are more likely to be male, there will be a gender skew in the general Hispanic population. Therefore, let us consider the Hispanic imprisonment rate relative to the number of males in the high-crime age range.</p>
<p>Suddenly the numbers change quite a bit, with the relative Hispanic-to-white total incarceration rate dropping by a third or more for several of the age cohorts. But even these lower figures may still be a bit misleading. As a recent front page New York Times story pointed out, over half of all federal prosecutions these days are for immigration-related offenses, and since a huge fraction of illegal immigrants are from south of the border, the 10 percent or so of U.S. prison inmates who are in federal custody might significantly distort our ethnic imprisonment statistics. Anyway, offenses such as robbery, rape, murder, burglary, assault, and theft are almost always prosecuted in state courts, so it makes sense to separate these street crimes from cases of illegal nannies convicted of illegal nannying.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Our first discovery is that even before adjusting for age, the overall Hispanic incarceration rate drops from 150 percent above the white rate down to just 80 percent above, presumably reflecting the exclusion of immigration-related federal offenses. We can now use census data to estimate the number of prime-crime-age young males in the two groups, and since there is some uncertainty in deciding which age range is most appropriate for normalization purposes, we should probably explore the results with several different choices, such as 18-29, 15-34, and 15-44.5 (Many observers believe that the number of Hispanic illegal immigrants in America is sharply underestimated by the government; if so, this would correspondingly reduce the relative Hispanic imprisonment rate.)</p>
<p>The overall age-adjusted national imprisonment rates are shown in Chart 1. Hispanic incarceration rates are now between 13 and 31 percent above the white average, depending upon which age range we choose for normalization purposes. By contrast, the claims of extremely high relative black incarceration rates widely publicized several years ago by The Sentencing Project remain correct even after these age adjustments.</p>
<p>Next, if we examine the relative age-adjusted Hispanic imprisonment rate for individual states, we find huge variations. In a number of states, the Hispanic rate is below the white rate, sometimes far below. For example, whites in West Virginia, Arkansas, and Louisiana are imprisoned at three to four times the Hispanic rate relative to their share of the crime-age population. To some degree, this reflects the time-lag impact of the recent arrival of large numbers of Hispanics in these locations, since most of the white convicts entered prison years ago, but such low relative rates of Hispanic incarceration are still intriguing. And even in Florida, where Hispanics have been a large fraction of the total population for decades, the white age-adjusted imprisonment rate is still twice as high as the Hispanic rate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Moreover, if we consider weighted-average age-adjusted Hispanic imprisonment ratios excluding those outlying cases of the Northeastern states, we discover that the remaining figure moves into close parity with white incarceration rates. Since Hispanics are still considerably poorer than whites, this is a striking result. Also, crime rates are always higher in densely populated urban areas than in suburbs or rural communities, and since Hispanics are three times as likely as whites to live in cities, their relatively low imprisonment rates become even more surprising.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The substantial regional or cultural differences in apparent white criminality are easily illustrated when we consider the age-adjusted Hispanic/white incarceration ratios in the two most heavily Hispanic states, California and Texas, which together contain roughly half of all Hispanics living in the United States. If we normalize the incarceration rate to the number of males aged 15-34, California Hispanics are imprisoned at 9 percent above the local white rate, while Texas Hispanics are imprisoned at 14 percent below the local white rate. Since California is one of America&rsquo;s most liberal &#8220;pro-minority&#8221; states and Texas one of the most staunchly &#8220;law-and-order&#8221; conservative ones, and the Hispanics in both states are overwhelmingly Mexican, these somewhat unexpected imprisonment ratios probably reflect the relative criminality of the local white populations more than anything else.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But there are good reasons to doubt the plausibility of that horrific scenario. First, contrary to popular belief, the majority of today&rsquo;s Hispanics are already American-born, and this is certainly true of those in the highest-crime age groups. For example, two-thirds of today&rsquo;s Latinos aged 18-24 are American citizens by birth. This figure has risen from less than half 20 years ago, while crime rates have simultaneously plummeted nationwide, with relative Hispanic imprisonment rates also dropping significantly since 2000. If American-born Mexicans and Central Americans had the exceptionally high crime rates suggested in that 2006 study, it is strange that we have seen no evidence of this either in the trends of national crime data or in imprisonment statistics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Take five minutes to consider the list of America&rsquo;s urban crime rates provided on Wikipedia, and you will notice an intriguing pattern. Nearly all of the most heavily Latino cities have low or even extremely low crime rates, and virtually none have rates much above the national average. Eighty percent Latino El Paso has the lowest homicide and robbery rates of any major city in the continental United States. This is not what we would expect to find if Hispanics had crime rates far higher than whites. Individual cities may certainly have anomalously low crime rates for a variety of reasons, but the overall trend of crime rates compared to ethnicity seems unmistakable.</p>
<p>But let us explore white and Hispanic crime rates in a more systematic fashion, drawing our data from the FBI Uniform Crime Report. Consider the five whitest cities in America: Colorado Springs, Colorado; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Portland, Oregon; Lexington, Kentucky; and Lincoln, Nebraska. These cities&rsquo; populations average 76 percent white, 9 percent Hispanic, and 8 percent black. Their crime rates are generally far below the national urban average, with less than half the homicide and robbery rates and a 30 percent lower violent-crime rate. Perhaps we can consider these figures as a reasonable approximation to the general &#8220;white urban crime rate.&#8221; These crime averages may be partly due to the local black and Hispanic populations, but since these cities are so overwhelmingly white, this estimate for the white crime rates is about as close as we can hope to get.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now let us consider the five most Hispanic cities in America: Corpus Christi, Texas; San Antonio, Texas; Miami, Florida; Santa Ana, California; and El Paso, Texas. Together they total over 3 million in population, averaging 68 percent Hispanic, 22 percent white, and 6 percent black. The ethnicities and crime rates of these cities are displayed in Chart 6.</p>
<p>Overall, the crime rates for these most heavily Hispanic cities are generally low, with violent crime 10 percent below the national urban average and the homicide rate 40 percent lower. On the other hand, the crime rates are still well above those of the white cities we considered above. In fact, the white homicide and violent crime rates are almost one-third lower. This provides some evidence for a higher Hispanic crime rate.</p>
<p>But this evidence is not particularly strong. First, the Hispanic cities are much larger than the white ones, with nearly double the average population. Also, Miami is an extreme outlier, with nearly twice as much crime as the other four Hispanic cities, and shifts the average considerably. If we exclude Miami, half the difference between the crime rates of the most Hispanic and the whitest cities disappears.</p>
<p>Even more striking, the average crime rates for the two most Hispanic cities on our list  &mdash;  Santa Ana and El Paso, each 80 percent Hispanic  &mdash;  are actually below our white urban average, and below the very low crime figures for 86 percent white Lincoln, the single whitest city in the nation. So although some heavily Hispanic cities have higher crime rates than some heavily white ones, the pattern seems very mixed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we consider the overall list of American cities, it is easy to find a number of those with sizable Hispanic populations  &mdash;  30, 40, 50 percent or more Hispanic  &mdash;  that have crime rates below our white urban average. If Hispanic crime rates were much higher than those for whites, this would seem very unlikely.</p>
<p>Similar evidence emerges if we restrict our analysis to major cities of half a million people or more and compare the average crime rates for the five most heavily Hispanic cities  &mdash;  Albuquerque, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Antonio, and El Paso  &mdash;  to the those of the five whitest  &mdash;  Oklahoma City, Columbus, Indianapolis, Seattle, and Portland. This time, the more Hispanic cities are the ones with the lower crime rates  &mdash;  10 percent below the white cities in homicide and 15 percent lower in violent crime. A particularly remarkable result is that gigantic Los Angeles  &mdash;  50 percent Hispanic and frequently perceived as a dangerous urban hellhole  &mdash;  has violent crime rates close to those of Portland, Oregon, the whitest major city in the nation at 74 percent. The Hispanic cities and their crime rates are displayed in Chart 7.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a final example, much closer to home. Consider two large and comparable American cities  &mdash;  San Jose, California and Seattle, Washington. Both are located on the West Coast, are overwhelmingly suburban and generally affluent, earn their living from the technology industry, are politically liberal, and have small black populations. Seattle is one of the whitest cities in America at 70 percent, with Asians being the largest minority; Hispanics number only 5 percent. By contrast, San Jose is over 50 percent larger in size and although mostly white and Asian, is one-third Hispanic, with a large number of impoverished illegal immigrants. Seattle&rsquo;s crime rate is indeed low, but the crime rate in San Jose is actually much lower: one-third lower for homicide or violent crime in general and with less than half the robbery rate. In fact, none of the most heavily white major cities in America have crime rates anywhere near as low as one-third Hispanic San Jose.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A reasonable question arises: are all of these crime rates actual, or might they be statistical artifacts produced by widespread underreporting of crime in heavily Hispanic areas? We cannot absolutely eliminate this possibility, but for homicides the reporting rate is always close to 100 percent, and since for all these cities the homicide and other serious crime rates tend to follow very similar patterns, there is no evidence that any of these racial patterns were warped by substantial underreporting.</p>
<p>Finally, let us consider the historical crime trends in my native Los Angeles, America&rsquo;s second-largest city. During the middle of the 20th century, it was by far America&rsquo;s whitest large city  &mdash;  roughly 80 percent white European by ancestry  &mdash;  and was generally regarded as America&rsquo;s middle-class suburban paradise. But as the decades went by, LA increasingly became a byword for violence, crime, and ethnic conflict, with the deadly Watts and Rodney King racial riots filling television screens across the country. These enormously negative social changes coincided exactly with the population becoming less white, and although relatively few analysts were willing to suggest a direct causal relationship, I suspect it was noticed by all but the most obtuse observers. {snip}</p>
<p>Since then, these ethnic demographic trends have continued apace, and Los Angeles today ranks as America&rsquo;s least white European large city. Half of the population is Hispanic, and many of these are impoverished illegal immigrants and their families. Yet all crime rates have been falling steadily over the last two decades, with homicide dropping a further 18 percent just last year. {snip}</p>
<p>This Los Angeles example also raises important questions about the official claims that Latino youths have exceptionally high rates of gang membership, 1800 percent higher than for whites. Los Angeles supposedly has among the worst Hispanic gang problems, yet the city&rsquo;s actual crime rates are roughly the same as what they were back in the lily-white days of the early 1960s. So if these local gangs aren&rsquo;t committing much crime, what exactly is the definition of a &#8220;gang&#8221;?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The evidence presented here powerfully refutes the widespread popular belief that America&rsquo;s Hispanics have high crime rates. Instead, their criminality seems to fall near the center of the white national distribution, being somewhat higher than white New Englanders but somewhat lower than white Southerners. Taken as a whole, the mass of statistical evidence constitutes strong support for the &#8220;null hypothesis,&#8221; namely that Hispanics have approximately the same crime rates as whites of the same age.</p>
<p>We must bear in mind that most Hispanics are still of very recent immigrant origins and thus are considerably poorer than the average American. There actually does exist a connection between poverty and crime, even if liberals make such a claim, and since today&rsquo;s Hispanic population has roughly the same crime rate as far more affluent whites, there is every reason to expect that this crime rate will drop further as Hispanics continue to move up the economic ladder. {snip}</p>

How many hispanics are classified as white?</p>
<p><i>Asians, who constitute the other large portion of the inflow, are generally regarded as economically successful and law-abiding.</i></p>
<p>That statement needs no further explanation or analysis. It&rsquo;s simply stated as a fact, a give; no explanation needed because it&rsquo;s obviously true.</p>
<p><i>So were my personal experiences [of not being a victim of racial/ethnic crime] atypical?</i></p>
<p>No. Blacks largely victimize blacks, whites victimize white, and hispanics victimize hispancis. That this individual wasn&rsquo;t a victim of hispanic violence doesn&rsquo;t mean incidents of hispanic violence are low.</p>
<p>Graph #2 shows that in the north-east, hispanic incarceration rates are in most cases more than three times that of whites. In Graph #3, the south-west, the rates average out as even.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I would speculate that in the NE, hispanics are classified differently than are hispaincs in the SW.</p>
<p>In graphs #8-13, notice that the categories are hispanic compared to white AND asian. A misleading comparison in my view.  <br>

		<p>When I was a boy, the LAPD sent TWO cops to our house to take a report on the theft of $11 worth of groceries from the back seat of an unlocked car.  Now they won&rsquo;t send out a single officer to investigate a car theft.  If crime rates are no higher than the 1960&rsquo;s, why are the cops too busy to bother with non-violent felonies?  </p>

		<p>I see that it&rsquo;s alright to discriminate on the basis of gender and age - but not so much on the basis of race.  Once again proving that race is the most important factor for liberals - or liberals calling themselves &#8220;conservatives&#8221; as the case may be.</p>

<p>A better comparison would have been Tacoma WA to San Jose CA. Tacoma is full of unruly blacks who use Seattle to commit crime. </p>

		<p>With regard to genetics, this makes some sense.  Two-thirds of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic whites tend to have the 4R allele of MAOA, the best understood violence gene.  One study found that blacks and Hispanics have more of the rare 2R allele, which might result in a very small number of very violent Hispanics.  Hispanics tend to have higher baseline testosterone, but I do not think there has been any research on their CAG repeat length in the androgen receptor gene, AR.  In general, the genetics of Hispanic people have been poorly studied.  Black people, on the other hand, would be expected to have higher rates of violence based on the genes, MAOA (3R and 2R), AR, DRD2, DRD4, and DAT1, as well as the low levels of cortisol, lower cortisol spikes, and higher levels of testosterone, testosterone spikes, estradiol, and SHBG.  SHBG levels, in particular, are known to be highly genetic.  I go into detail about this science in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hSQDArsn_4&amp;videos=Fa-MqcWcj4k&amp;playnext_from=TL&amp;playnext=1" rel="nofollow">videos</a> and <a href="https://theunsilencedscience.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">blogs</a>.</p>

		<p><i>Eighty percent Latino El Paso has the lowest homicide and robbery rates of any major city in the continental United States.</i></p>
<p>The author is being quite dishonest here.  Although the 05-07 Census survey does note that El Paso is 80% Hispanic, the city is also 76% white (i.e. 3 of 4 Hispanics identify as white   &mdash;   a crucial fact the author completely glosses over).  So in fact El Paso is exactly as &#8220;white&#8221; as the sample white cities the author lists.  I&rsquo;ve never been to the place so can&rsquo;t vouch as to the true &#8220;whiteness&#8221; of the city, but a quick search of El Paso businesses seems to suggest that there is a large contingent of White (but Hispanic) El Paso-ans.  </p>
<p>Also worth noting that El Paso has less than half the percentage of blacks as the sample white cities (under three percent).  Still   &mdash;   it is interesting, considering that the city of Ciudad Juarez, right across the river, which shares El Paso&rsquo;s demographics, is, according to Wikipedia, &#8220;the most violent zone in the world outside of declared war zones.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;We must bear in mind that most Hispanics are still of very recent immigrant origins and thus are considerably poorer than the average American.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy this. They are not THAT considerably poorer. NOT from what I see and I see a lot of hispanics. They seem to do pretty well across the board. ONLY those that are seasonal migrants traveling back and for to Mex are considerably poorer. The rest, not so much poorer. NO! Does anyone dismiss the claim that most neighborhoods that are heavily Mex have also very heavy gang presence and very heavy gang membership. Something not intuitively right about this article. Stats can lie!</p>

		<p>A very nice article&hellip;.entertaining too. No doubt the author is passonate about &#8220;proving&#8221; his point.</p>
<p>What he does not mention is the heavy use of Hispanic police officers in areas with a significant number of Hispanics. Does this also lower the REPORTED Hispanic crime rate?</p>
<p>He also does not mention the tendency to deport illegal aliens arrested for serious crimes, without bothering with the courts. In such cases, deportation saves some of them from the death penalty. In the rest of the cases, the state avoids the cost of trial and incarceration for decades. This escape valve keeps reported crimes by Hispanics low and deportation enables them to avoid the gallows only to slip back into this country in a few days. The use of deportation to save tax dollars only releases violent offenders on a helpless American citizenry and certainly keeps Hispanic crimes from being reported to his database.</p>
<p>He also does not mention the fact that so many illegal aliens (Hispanics) are unwilling to report crimes to the police out of fear of being deported themselves. Hispanics do commit crimes against other Hispanics, but a good many may go completely unreported. Check with the local hospital emergency room for Hispanics with injuries and wounds that were &#8220;accidental&#8221;. This also hides the Hispanic crimes from being reported.</p>
<p>He also does not mention the fact that murders (and disappearances) of Hispanics who are &#8220;not documented&#8221; are also not documented or reported when they are found dead in a ditch with their shoes tucked neatly by their side. More to the point, how many are not found in roadside ditches, but are simply disposed of on land or sea? Would this also keep crimes from being included in the Hispanic crime rate?</p>

<p>Putting aside the &#8216;crime argument&rsquo; for a moment (which I don&rsquo;t find convincing at all), even if the rates for certain types of crimes were identical, Hispanics are still considerably less intelligent than the average Northern European.

		<p>This is an interesting and thought-provoking piece.</p>
<p>My only experience or observations regarding Hispanics come from personal associations, which on the whole have been pretty much favorable.</p>
<p>In two tours in Vietnam, one with a rifle company and one with the 5th Special Forces, I served with and commanded a goodly number of Hispanic troopers, particularly in the conventional line company.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall ever having an inordinate number, if any, disciplinary problems with them.  Quite the contrary, they generally made good, disciplined, and often highly aggressive soldiers.</p>
<p>My only contacts with them as a civilian have been through general contractors of various types.  Whether their Hispanic worker were illegals, naturalized, or native-born Americans I can&rsquo;t readily say, but they always seemed hard-working, efficient, and after they were done I never had hand tools or various other implements mysteriously missing from my garage or basement, as has occasionally happened with white plumbers, carpenters, or electricians.</p>
<p>Obviously, one man&rsquo;s personal experience is not a statistically reliable indicator, but it does make me somewhat sympathetic to the suggestion that estimates on Hispanic-committed crime in the US perhaps are overblown.</p>

		<p>One point not raised in the article is the second-generation effect one sees with many immigrants: the first generation mostly behaves itself since its main interest is working and sending money home; it is the second generation, assimilated to America, that poses the problem  &mdash;  because they often assimilate to Africa-America, not the America of the responsible middle class. The entire style of Latino youth gangs  &mdash;  hanging on street corners, hand signals, bandannas, saggy trousers, graffiti  &mdash;  consists of cultural traits borrowed from Africa-America. Keep second generation Latinos away from Africa-America, and they may very well turn out OK. Hmmm  &mdash;  could be a good argument for re-segregation of schools&hellip;</p>

		<p>Mr. Unz is remiss not to mention the fact that the areas with the lowest crime rates tend to be predominately white states with very low Hispanic immigration and stable populations such as the Dakotas, Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire. Conversely, states with disproportionately high Latino populations tend to have above-average crime-rates such as Nevada, Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, and Florida. Moreover, if one believes that high teen fertility rates and rising illegitimacy are strong predictors of future crime, then Americans can look forward to steady increases in lawlessness. Latinos now have higher teen birth rates than blacks and the latest data reveal that the Hispanic illegitimacy rate is nearly 50 percent.  </p>

		<p>You know what this is all about, right?  Cooking the books to make it look like hispanics are just as law abiding as the average white.  Setting the stage, in other words, in hopes that we swallow Obama&rsquo;s planned Amnesty plan.  It&rsquo;s a load of horse dung.  Same with the follow on article about linking criminal activity to age.  It&rsquo;s all a load of horse manure.  Blacks are committing crimes 7-800% more than whites, and hispanics are committing crimes 400% more than whites.  Hispanic gangs are even more viscious than black gangs, and blacks don&rsquo;t have the luxery of running across the border, adopting a new name, and returning after their crimes.</p>

<i>One point not raised in the article is the second-generation effect one sees with many immigrants: the first generation mostly behaves itself since its main interest is working and sending money home; it is the second generation, assimilated to America, that poses the problem</i></p>
<p>Ron Unz does indeed address this:</p>
<p><b>From the article:</b><br>
<i>Another important question is to what degree Hispanic criminal activity is influenced by immigration status. While there is a widespread popular impression that immigrants, especially illegal immigrants, have a propensity for violent crime, actual studies almost invariably come to the opposite conclusion: for almost every ethnic group, Hispanic or otherwise, immigrant generations have lower rates of criminal behavior than their American-born children. This has resulted in concerned speculation that even if Hispanic crime rates today are relatively low, this situation may be temporary, and once the Hispanic population shifts from being mostly immigrant to mostly native-born, crime rates might skyrocket. A 2006 Migration Policy Institute study estimated that imprisonment rates are some eight times higher for American-born citizens of Mexican ancestry than for their immigrant co-ethnics.6 If we can expect Mexican-American crime rates to rise 700 percent in the next generation, we should be very alarmed indeed.</i></p>
<p><i>But there are good reasons to doubt the plausibility of that horrific scenario. First, contrary to popular belief, the majority of today&rsquo;s Hispanics are already American-born, and this is certainly true of those in the highest-crime age groups. For example, two-thirds of today&rsquo;s Latinos aged 18-24 are American citizens by birth. This figure has risen from less than half 20 years ago, while crime rates have simultaneously plummeted nationwide, with relative Hispanic imprisonment rates also dropping significantly since 2000. If American-born Mexicans and Central Americans had the exceptionally high crime rates suggested in that 2006 study, it is strange that we have seen no evidence of this either in the trends of national crime data or in imprisonment statistics.</i></p>
<p><i>The major difficulty with the study&rsquo;s evidence is that while prisons have an easy time gathering ethnicity data, determining the immigration status of convicts is far more difficult, and is generally based on self-reporting. Not surprisingly, most convicted felons are not eager to reveal their lack of citizenship and then face deportation once their sentences are completed, so the numbers must be taken with a grain of salt. In fact, a November 2009 paper by Steven A. Camarota and Jessica M. Vaughan for the Center for Immigration Studies raised serious doubts about the accuracy of these federal immigrant-imprisonment statistics, both based on the doubtful methodology employed and the huge, anomalous swings that occur on an ongoing basis.7 For example, the official data seems to show a 28 percent decline in the number of incarcerated immigrants between 1990 and 2000, even as the total number of immigrants grew 59 percent, then a sudden 146 percent rise in incarcerated immigrants from 2000 to 2007, a period when immigrant numbers grew only 22 percent. Such changes seem highly implausible and lead to serious doubts that the gap between immigrant Hispanic and American-born Hispanic criminality is anywhere near as great as has been portrayed. Besides, since perhaps two-thirds of today&rsquo;s highest-crime-age Hispanic population is already American-born, there is a strong upper bound on how much crime rates would rise in the future as that fraction gradually rises to three-quarters or more.</i></p>

		<p>Wow. This guy does seem to bend over backwards to tell me that the barrios I used to have to travel in San Antonio, Los Angeles, Dallas, Phoenix and others are just as nice and no more crime ridden than any of the white neighborhoods in those same cities. And that there has been no significant spike in criminal and gang related activity in otherwise nice, and even upscale, white towns such as Germantown MD as latinos have poured in, and gangs like Mara Salvatrucha have taken over areas of them. </p>
<p>I just love it when people search for a hundred ways to look at things so as to make the scenario look the way they want. I mean hey, who am I supposed to believe, them, or my lying eyes?</p>

		<p>My experiences with Hispanics had been overwhelmingly negative. They attempted to harm me on the job more than once, by throwing steel 50 feet to the dock floor where I was walking, energizing electrical circuits I was working on, and on one occasion rushing a man next to me with an upraised hatchet. Had I had a gun, I would have used it to relieve the world of at least one violent, Hispanic criminal alien that day. Rushing a man with an upraised hatchet creates a pretext for the legal use of lethal force for self-defense. They are dangerous, violent, and should be expelled from the country by force. They go out of their way to attack whites, they are responsible for untold murders, rapes and robberies against whites and they are sooner or later going to launch a genocidal campaign against us if La Raza and MEChA are representative of their hateful, evil ideologies and beliefs.</p>

He said that was besides the point, the point was that he didn&rsquo;t want America to become Mexico or any other nation.  </p>
<p>Personally, I find most immigrants from Mexico to be hard-working and decent people.  I defy anyone to spend a weekend as a tourist in NYC, staying at a hotel and going to restaurants, and not have a fairly favorable view of the role of Hispanics in that part of the NYC economy, especially compared to the sort of people who would be doing the same work if the Mexicans weren&rsquo;t around.  But I&rsquo;m not at all convinced that they and especially their offspring will be able to integrate into this country anywhere near as well as the southern Europeans and Jews were able to integrate in the 20th Century.  </p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to read through all the comments, so forgive me if someone has already made these points.  If it takes multiple print pages to prove what should be a simple point, the author is probably trying to spin you.  I suspect this is the case here.</p>
<p>Instead of purely focusing on white vs. Hispanic crime rates, this author chooses to use some complex, made-up matrix of comparing &#8220;white&#8221; cities to &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; cities.  This is a flawed strategy for many reasons.  First of all, there are numerous differences in regional crime rates and how different police departments report crimes which is not accounted for using the author&rsquo;s comparison.  </p>
<p>Second, the author seems to forget that it takes at least 2 people - a criminal and a victim - to commit a crime.  It is well-documented that ethnic criminals prefer white victims because we are seen as easier targets and are more likely to have things worth stealing.  A &#8220;white&#8221; city, thus, would provide numerous opportunities for ethnic criminals, resulting in a higher crime rate.</p>
<p>Third, in a &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; city, it comes to reason that a much larger portion of the victims would also be Hispanic.  Hispanics are notorious for not going to the police, either because of cultural attitudes or concerns over their own immigration status.  How many crimes in this &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; cities go unreported?</p>
<p>If the author really wanted to compare white crime rates vs. Hispanic crime rates, he could have done this very simply.  Just look at the data for one of the &#8220;white&#8221; cities and see if Hispanics are committing crimes at a rate disproportionate to their percentage of the population.  If this is the case, which I&rsquo;m sure it is, the author&rsquo;s premise is bogus.</p>
<p>It is sad what has happened to The American Conservative.  I used to be a subscriber but recently let my subscription lapse.  The magazine has become obsessed with the wars in the Middle East and almost every article is just some anti-war rant.  I&rsquo;m against the wars, too, but I could get this same content from watching MSNBC.  The last issue I received had an article blasting the BNP.  That was enough for me.  </p>

		<p>The elephant in the living room here is the issue of who is classified as &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;hispanic.&#8221; For example, just recently AmRen showed a page full of mugshots of &#8220;whites&#8221; arrested for violent crimes who were visually clearly hispanic and who had hispanic last names.</p>
<p>I am very skeptical of this article, and I will continue to have questions about what the real crime rate among hispanics is until the issue of racial classification is resolved. I&rsquo;m not going to hold my breath waiting for this to happen either, because clearly it&rsquo;s in the interest of the pro-amnesty elites to not keep accurate statistics.</p>
<p>And when all is said and done, suppose that it turns out that hispanics have about the same crime rates as whites - my response would be: So What? You want a cookie for not breaking the law, José?</p>
<p>Also, as someone already pointed out - the crime rate among illegal aliens is 100%.</p>

<i>Hispanic immigrants are institutionalized (usually that means in prison) at only about half the rate of white natives, but Hispanic natives are in institutions at about three times the white rate. As I said, this is the &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; view of immigration and crime supported by most academics.</i></p>
<p>(&hellip;)</p>
<p><i>increased crime in the second generation is consistent with an increase in several other underclass behaviors. As the chart above indicates, labor force dropout, illegitimacy, and welfare usage are all much higher among Hispanic natives than among Hispanic immigrants. (Those data come from reliable interviews of normal people outside of prison.) It makes sense that crime would increase if all of those other underclass problems are increasing as well.</i><br>
(&hellip;)</p>
<p>So, the children of Hispanic immigrants assimilate to underclass norms. I can see no way to prevent this without a miraculous reconstruction of the shame-based WASP-dominant culture of the US that started falling apart beginning with the Sixties Cultural Revolution in 1965.</p>

		<p>I believe that it is somehow reckless that white nationalists try to prove that certain racial/ethnic/religious groups are more violent or less intelligent than the others (in that case white). People don&rsquo;t want to hear that. People prefere to believe that everyone is equal and everyone can achieve anything. You cannot gain much support by repeating this. White people have to be aware of their racial, cultural identity and the importance of preserving it. I think white nationalists can help with that&hellip;</p>

<p>This type of &#8216;genetic&rsquo; causality is completely discredited. Unless you can tie genes to any sort of malady afflicting whites, then it&rsquo;s Ok, considered top science, especially if a type of illness brought on by stress.</p>
<p>ADHD, depression, mental illness, homosexuality, even things such as alcoholism&hellip; when it comes to whites - a day can&rsquo;t go by without these attributed to genetics. </p>

		<p>What the graphs tell us is that Hispanics, on average, commit crimes at least as often, or more so, than their poor white counterparts.  When you compare the average white, living in a predominantly white community, to the average Hispanic, living in a predominantly Hispanic community, the crime rates for Hispanics are in fact much higher than whites.  Much higher.</p>
<p>But after normalizing the equation (this is hyperbole for taking out all the bad Hispanics from the equation and leaving in the bad whites), what the article is really telling us is that a sack of good Hispanic lemons (after tossing out the bad ones) doesn&rsquo;t really look too bad when compared to a sack of bad white apples.  Unfortunately, the bad lemons that have been taken out of the lemon sack are residing in the white apples sack.  The white apple sack is now starting to smell like the lemons.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now up to the good white apples to send all the lemons back from whence they came.   </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this for one minute.  With so many whites such as me leaving the Southwest over the past 20 years, largely due to crimes against us and our children, and Hispanic gangs making life difficult even in once all white neighborhoods, this paper seems like a completely fabricated lie/forgery.  </p>
<p>What I could perhaps believe is that partiy has been reached between the number of white youth that remain in the Southwest who NOW participate in crimes that once were dominated by Hispanics.</p>
<p>But as others write, this is no reason to import more of them or advocate that Whites interbreed with them.  The aim of this article and others like it, is to destroy the white race, not as an Hispanic apology.</p>

		<p>From Statsaholic:</p>
<p>&#8220;Much like a magician sawing a lady in half, American Conservative Publisher and Writer Ron Unz has created an illusion by making it so we only see a misrepresentative part of what is actually there.</p>
<p>The basic issue with Unz&rsquo;s &#8220;His-Panic&#8221; Article, where he tries to convince people that Hispanics are nearly as law abiding as Whites, is that because Hispanics are much more likely to be in the Country Illegally, they are far more likely to have the crimes they commit go to a Federal Court. </p>
<p>And this applies even for those of their crimes that aren&rsquo;t immigration related. </p>
<p>After all, most often an Illegal Immigrant will only be taken into custody by the Feds because he committed a Violent or Drug Related Crime, as opposed to being taken in by the Feds just because he was in the Country illegally. </p>
<p>So guess what Unz does in his study? </p>
<p>He deliberately excludes people incarcerated for Crimes they were convicted of in Federal Court, instead only looking at people incarcerated for Crimes they were convicted of in State Courts.</p>
<p>Thus he rejects the far more valid technique used in The Color of Crime, which involved combining those convicted in State Court with those convicted in Federal Court to get a comprehensive and unbiased sample.</p>
<p>For this reason the American Conservative Article can be described as nothing more than a damned lie, carefully designed to dupe the gullible and weak minded.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Depsite claims to the contrary, this piece was in fact put together by some disingenuous immigration booster. When I was growing up in Los Angeles in the 1970&rsquo;s, before &#8220;hispanics&#8221; existed, there was a sizable &#8216;Mexican&rsquo; population. The crime levels in these latino neighborhoods were much higher than those in the white neighborhoods. The Mexican children whom I went to school with, were generally violent, at least half of the boys were in gangs, and they were uniformly awful when it came to schoolwork. Every day was nothing but fights. Flash forward to today, the city is filled with these people from Mexico and other latin American countries. Crime is out of control, the murder rate is through the roof. Go to the LAPD&rsquo;s website and look at the &#8220;Most Wanted&#8221; and the types of crimes these people are wanted for. To say they commit no more crimes than whites or that their crime levels are no higher than those of whites is an incredible level of lying. And the media will cover for this fraud every step of the way. </p>
<p>This piece is nothing but lies and statistical manipulation from top to bottom. Ron Unz has been an advance soldier for the neocon types and their self-deception for many years. Every move he makes is calculated to hurt whites, to aid in their dispossession by non-whites. Mr. Unz makes sure he doesn&rsquo;t live around a lot of hispanics. I&rsquo;d say that makes him somewhat of a hypocrite. </p>

		<p>i read the ron unz article. i also read the new rushton article on vdare. first of all, and i repeat myself, no serious research can be done using the american english definition of &#8220;hispanic&#8221;. there is no such thing as a &#8220;hispanic&#8221; person, not using the american english definiton. it&rsquo;s a made up term that is not connected to reality. it confounds any social science research right off the bat, since it is not connected to genes.</p>
<p>actual hispanics are genetically spanish - they&rsquo;re european. hispanic means &#8220;of spain&#8221;. this is no different than actual anglo-saxons being actual anglo-saxons, actual scandinavians being actual scandinavians, actual slavs being actual slavs. pau gasol, the tall white guy on the lakers, is an actual hispanic. the short, fat, brown guys who rioted outside of the staples center when the lakers beat the magic 4-1 in the 2009 NBA finals, are not hispanic. they&rsquo;re mestizo. and these guys are not the same as david ortiz on the red sox, or any other africans from the caribbean, like pierre garcon on the indianapolis colts. putting all these humans into one group makes no sense and immediately breaks the validity of social science statistics.</p>
<p>having said that, i&rsquo;m not buying that mestizos have a violent crime rate equal to europeans. the only place i&rsquo;m buying this is in texas, where a huge segment of the mestizo population have been there for hundreds of years, are completely integrated, and where everybody is armed, making everybody rather polite.</p>
<p>across the US, the unreported crime rate of mestizos has to be somewhat high, due to the illegal alien effect: not wanting to report crimes due to fear of being deported. this is why so many american mayors operate sanctuary cities. to keep the crime rate at least manageable, by trying to encourage the MILLIONS of illegal aliens to seek police assistance without fear of arrest.</p>
<p>of course the crime rate alone does not take into account that border jumpers just plain make america more dangerous, especially on the road. i personally was almost killed when illegal aliens crashed into me in nevada. and of course, i got the ticket and the increased car insurance rate, because that is police procedure and insurance company procedure in an nation with 20 million illegal aliens. they know who i am. they know i will pay. they know i won&rsquo;t flee the country or ignore the law.</p>
<p>also, yes, mestizos have lower testosterone than europeans. they&rsquo;re also shorter, weaker, less athletic, they run slower, and jump lower (no negative athletic stereotypes about them, strangely). they&rsquo;re less intelligent, less creative, less scientifically inclined, less musically inclined: they&rsquo;re simply mediocre from an HBD perspective. and they break rushton&rsquo;s &#8220;humans on a sliding scale model&#8221;, which was the first evidence i considered 15 years ago when contemplating rushton&rsquo;s ideas.</p>

		<p>My father-in-law went to high school in Los Angeles in the 1950s.  He said even back then Mexicans had violent tendencies.  They&rsquo;d jump you for looking at them the wrong way, and girls hid knives in their hairdos.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the Detroit area I personally knew some decent Hispanic people.  My aunt was married to a Puerto Rican.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Hispanics as a whole are a bunch of violent thugs&hellip;it just seems that they&rsquo;re below whites but above blacks.</p>

		<p>  Considering the different Latin American ethnic groups in the country, the term &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; can cover broad territory. Cubans are different from Chicanos, who are different from Dominicans, etc. The bottom line is we don&rsquo;t want our country to become like Mexico or most of Latin American. MS 13, Mexican Mafia, Los Lobos, we don&rsquo;t want these gangsters moving to main street America. As for supposedly safe El Paso, check out the most wanted: https://www.ci.el-paso.tx.us/police/mostwanted.asp  Do you notice a pattern?</p>

		<p>&#8220;The premise of the argument, which Mr. Unz never substaniates, is that poverty causes crime&#8221;.</p>
<p>There was another book out, probably banned by now, that pointed out that as the rates of poverty went substantially down 1950 to 1960 + (at one point nearly 80% of americans lived in povery, down to low of about 15% in 1978) during this same time period the crime rate grew exponentially.</p>
<p>To some extent, this is what AmRen is about. </p>
<p>It was probably true, however, that even in 1950, the poorest Americans were those most likely to commit crime. <br>

		<p>We must also &#8220;bear in mind&#8221; that mestizos don&rsquo;t have their own criminal category.  Only a seperate victim one(funny how that works out).  Looked at Cali&rsquo;s most wanted webpage lately?  Yeah, only one or two of the &#8220;whites&#8221; are actually white.</p>

		<p>Anybody watch No Country For Old Men?  Because what is striking about that film are the subtle comments about Hispanic-Anglo race relations in America and how accurate they are: an icy-willed Anglo cowboy Vietvet tests his wits against a fanatical Hispanic along the US-Mexican border in 1980.</p>
<p>The film points out, to those who get it, that the character of Spaniards like Bardem the assassin who conquered the Indians and intermarried with them were a bad lot to begin with, who had only one desire: gold.  In modern times, no surprise that they are genetically inclined towards violent brigandery, because we are talking about the descendents of Spanish bandits and soldiers and local Indian girls.  </p>
<p>And no surprise that they should find their worst resistance from the Scots-Irish drifters whose descendents are now the trailer park denizens like the Brolin character.</p>
