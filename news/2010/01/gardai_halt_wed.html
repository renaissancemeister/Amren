			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Allison Bray, Irish Independent (Dublin), January 26 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A PAKISTANI man&rsquo;s plans to walk down the aisle with a Lithuanian teenager this week were cancelled after gardai objected to the marriage.</p>
<p>The Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) intervened to stop Muhammad Shafi&rsquo;s marriage to the 18-year-old woman from going ahead.</p>
<p>Mr Shafi (27), of Collegeview apartments, Ballymun, Dublin, was due to marry the woman in Letterkenny, Co Donegal, on Thursday.</p>
<p>However, the wedding was cancelled after GNIB Det Chief Supt John O&rsquo;Driscoll lodged an objection to the marriage on the basis that immigration officials believe it would be a marriage of convenience for residency purposes.</p>
<p>The bureau&rsquo;s intervention was revealed in court yesterday after Mr Shafi was fined €250. He had pleaded guilty at Blanchardstown District Court to possessing both a bogus Italian and Hungarian passport.</p>
<p><b>Bogus</b></p>
<p>Det Garda Sean O&rsquo;Meara told the court that Mr Shafi came under the bureau&rsquo;s radar as part of a larger investigation into bogus marriages between Asian men and Eastern European women.</p>
<p>He said that Mr Shafi was arrested as part of the investigation in to more than 100 cases of marriages or intended marriage involving women from Latvia, Lithuania and Poland who were paid to marry men from Asia in order to secure them the right of residency in Ireland and other EU countries.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understood that the scam involves a bogus company set up here by Asian men who advertise well-paying jobs for former Eastern bloc women.</p>
<p>They are supplied with false documents in order to secure residency rights for their Asian &#8220;husbands&#8221;, some of whom are believed to have paid up to €10,000 for the marriage certificate.</p>
<p>The court heard that Mr Shafi was one of more than 20 cricket players from Pakistan who arrived here on a seven-day visa for a supposed cricket match in July, 2008, but that the entire &#8220;team&#8221; disappeared after gaining entry to the State.</p>
<p>The matter of so-called residency marriages was also raised by Justice Minister Dermot Ahern this weekend at an EU summit on immigration in Spain, where he said there was growing evidence of such abuse.</p>
<p>&#8220;The love affair between Pakistan and the Baltic states shows no sign of abating,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He cited statistics last year which showed 384 applications for residency were submitted by Pakistani men. Of them, 110 were based on marriages to Latvian women, followed by 50 marriages to Polish women and 47 marriages to women from Estonia. He said the Pakistani husbands tended to be students or former students with no right to residency here.</p>
<p>Fine Gael&rsquo;s immigration spokesman Denis Naughton, meanwhile, said the case illustrated the urgent need to crack down on such sham marriages.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2006, 1,207 applications for residency were made in Ireland by non-EU nationals by virtue of being married to an non-Irish EU citizen. In 2009 this figure rose to 2,116. Unusually, even though the number of EU nationals resident in Ireland is reducing, the numbers seeking residency on the basis of marriage to an EU citizen has increased by 175pc.&#8221;<br>

<p>Almost two years have passed, and nothing has been done to rid Ireland of this criminal. </p>
<p>Pakistan has 180 million people. Ireland has 5.5 million. Ireland must protect its racial-territorial heritage with the same ruthless determination both sides displayed during the &#8220;troubles&#8221;.</p>

		<p>        I wish this kind of marriage annullment would happen in the US more often. A cousin of mine has an illegal alien Mexican girlfriend who wants to marry him, and it doesnt take a rocket scientist to see why she wants to.</p>

		<p>I am a European immigrant in Ireland. The situation in here is also hopeless like in the USA. There are non-whites everywhere, in Dublin one may feel like if he was in Beijing. In Galway there are plent of Middle Easterners. A few ears ago there was very little crime in here, now it is dangerous to go out in the evening. The worse thing is that the Irish do not mind this. Most of them actually support the multiculty. I am very concerned about the future of my WHITE children&hellip;</p>

		<p>This fake marriage racket involving non-Europeans should have been stopped years ago by amending marriage/immigration laws, by not recognizing such marriages and immediately deporting the offenders.</p>

		<p>Everyone in Ireland embraces the multicult ideology. Our politicians are no exception. No one is propery keeping track of the numbers coming in here. Our economy is in tatters, and yet this problem continues. We have a small population and so could be one of the western nations to collapse due to 3rd world immigration. I just hope to be prepared to leave and move elsewhere before that time arrives. </p>

		<p>It isn&rsquo;t just marriage; Eastern Europeans have sought all sorts of ways of getting into the West.  Here&rsquo;s one that I experiences personally while I lived in Slovenia.  A friend&rsquo;s cousin wanted me to endorse her as an au pair.  She even prepared a letter for me to sign.  In it, she wrote that she had taken care of my children for years - children I never had and do not have.  I told her that I could not sign a fraudulent document like that.  She got angry and vowed to &#8220;get to California&#8221; despite that.  The sad thing is that aside from that, she seemed to be a real nice young woman.  Many Eastern Europeans just don&rsquo;t understand the seriousness of these sort of frauds.  </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t understand why they want to come to the West now anyway.  Some still think they can get rich and famous, I suppose.  It is true that many business frauds, like the billion or so a year bilked through Medicare frauds, are perpetrated equally by Eastern Europeans and Middle Easterners.</p>

<p>The reason they come to Western nations from Islamic countries is TO CHANGE THEM into Islamic countries. Like people from Pittsburgh, Pa. come to my home in the South and look for places LIKE Pittsburgh!!! Go figure! And BTW, we all know that Pakistanis are NOT Asian, they are simply troublesome muslims.</p>

<p>I guess marrying a Lithuanian gives him an unlimited residence permit for Lithuania and Lithuanian citizenship subsequently (perhaps not automatically but within a few years). </p>
<p>Lithuania is an EU country and an EU citizen is free to live in any country in the EU, including Ireland.</p>

<p>  This is what I find unbelievable. Ireland has collapsed economically and yet Third World immigrants are still allowed, no even encouraged, to come to Ireland. Eire is a country of only 4 million people  &mdash;  smaller than some districts of Mumbai.</p>

		<p>As some posters reported, the Whites in Ireland do not mind that their country is being invaded by floods of aliens.  They are too scared to come out of their houses for fear of being attacked by the aliens, but still seem not to mind the alien invasion.  That must be so, otherwise they would have kicked out alienist politicians out of office.</p>
<p>That is the ROOT problem in White nations.  The gullible white people who do not mind the 3rd world alien invasion. Because self-preservation (and by corollary, race and nation preservation) are biologically ingrained traits, and are essential for survival, the deterioration of these traits is a mental illness. </p>
<p>Whites in Europe who kept voting for Blair, Whites in USA who support the alien invasion, Whites in Ireland who seem not to mind, Whites in Massachusetts who kept voting for Kennedy despite his war on the nation  &mdash;  should be considered mentally deranged because they lack the basic instinct of self-preservation.  This basic instinct has been snuffed in them. </p>
<p>So what is the point.  This point is not merely academic, but practical.  One of the most important step is dealing with such problems is to IDENTIFY the cause, make the person AWARE of the problem and make him REALIZE/ACCEPT the problem.  The solution then follows.</p>
<p>So as I do now, I encourage all patriots to make such people aware that their tolerance of the alien invasion, despite all its costs and harms and destruction of their nation and race, is a mental illness because of the reasons stated above.  Once alienists realize that they are mentally ill (aware), they will first resist but then eventually realize it as such.  This will lead them to change their mind and speak up against the alien invasion that is destroying their lives, their race, their culture and their nation.</p>
