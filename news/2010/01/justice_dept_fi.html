<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/us/14justice.html">Justice Dept. Fights Bias in Lending</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charlie Savage, New York Times, January 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tom Perez, the assistant attorney general for the department&rsquo;s [Department of Justice&rsquo;s] Civil Rights Division, is expected to announce Thursday in New York that the administration is creating a new unit that will focus exclusively on unfair lending practices.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Perez plans to formally announce the new unit at the &#8220;Wall Street Project&#8221; conference organized by the Rev. Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. He characterized the effort as a major turnaround, and criticized the previous administration as failing to scrutinize lending practices amid the subprime mortgage boom.</p>
<p>While past lending discrimination cases primarily focused on &#8220;redlining&#8221;  &mdash;  a bank&rsquo;s refusal to lend to qualified borrowers in minority areas  &mdash;  the new push will instead center on a more recent phenomenon critics have called &#8220;reverse redlining.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They encourage lenders to make risky loans for reasons such as diversity, and then when lenders have a problem because they made too many risky loans, they condemn them for that,&#8221; said Ernest Istook, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under federal civil rights laws, a lending practice is illegal if it has a disparate impact on minority borrowers, and the Obama administration is signaling that it intends to make the enforcing of fair lending laws a signature policy push in 2010.</p>

		<p>A few weeks ago, Barney Frank proposed to set aside $4 trillion for future bank bailouts, or a permanent TARP.  Now we know why   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re gearing up for more affirmative action mortgages.</p>

<p>OH GOODY! this new division means the unemployed number of blacks wil be reduced by the total number of employees in this new division! should be about 18,000 if other divisions are a milestone.</p>

		<p>Tsk.  All this unpleasantness could have been avoided if the bank folks had just TOLD the would-be borrowers that they WERE in fact expected to PAY BACK the money on the loan, in a timely manner, as in monthly payments&hellip;..oops&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Any sensible lending policy will have disparate impact on blacks because blacks as a whole are poor credit risks.  They are more likely to default on a loan that a white person even when they have the same income.  So the law says we must have foolish lending policies, and look where it&rsquo;s got us.</p>

		<p>This is, as they say, deja vu all over again. Back in, I think, 1992, there was a report out of Boston having to do with disparate lending. My local newspaper bleated editorially about how terrible it was not to lend to people in certain neighborhoods (i.e. all the loans that eventually lead to the current mess). I wrote a letter to the editor (letter not published) that the paper wanted loans made in neighborhoods where they themselves would not put newspaper vending machines.<br>
This proposal is like trying to put out a fire by pouring gasoline on it. </p>

		<p>These liberals must have learned by now that all these measures do not work and will not ever work.  To admit that, however, means they will have to admit that certain ethnicities are, on average, unable to reach the same levels of responsibility as whites.  The liberals whole worldview would thus be destroyed.  So, like flat-earthers, they will continue to spout their theories for only God knows how long.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve said for years that what we are seeing is not discrimination of skin color- it&rsquo;s discrimination of how heavy or light your wallet is. Poor whites are completely abandoned by their more affluent &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221;. Do you think that a fat cat living in the Hamptons cares about a poor schlub from Queens who is trying to raise a family of 4 on a $40,000/yr salary? Not even close. That is why the white race is in jeopardy. Add to it the fact that far-left liberals would rather let the criminals (black, brown or Arab)own guns than the hard-working law-abiding centrist or moderate white guy, and you need not look any further for the deterioration of what our hard working European-American grandfathers and grandmothers created. </p>
