			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, Dec. 30, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Russia&rsquo;s population statistics are rising for the first time since 1995, says Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. </p>
<p>Mr Putin said that for the past five years the number of deaths had declined, while births had risen. </p>
<p>He said statistics to be released shortly would show life-expectancy had almost reached the age of 69. </p>
<p>As president, Mr Putin brought in policies to stop population decline, which has been blamed on emigration, alcoholism, and poor health care. </p>
<p>&#8216;Symbolic amount&rsquo; </p>
<p>&#8220;We can say with a high degree of confidence that Russia will register a growth in population for the first time since 1995,&#8221; said Mr Putin at an end-of-year government meeting broadcast on state television. </p>
<p>His spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the total anticipated population growth in 2009 was only about 20,000  &mdash;  but he said this was a &#8220;symbolic&#8221; amount. </p>
<p>Health Minister Tatyana Golikova said the first month of population growth in 15 years came in August this year, when the birth rate increased by 1,000. </p>
<p>Figures published in November said Russia&rsquo;s population stood at 141.9 million. <br>

Is the population rise from ethnic Russians or immigrants muslims?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Figures published in November said Russia&rsquo;s population stood at 141.9 million.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The US population stands at over 300 million. Considering the land mass of Russia, they seem to be underpopulated. Maybe they have room for an ethnic white homeland.<br>

		<p>This is very uplifting news, given that Russia does not look to immigrants for the dis-benefits of diversity, or for labour to do jobs Russians will not do. Instead, Putin actively encourages, without money bribes, migrants to leave. So the gain must be coming from large increases in fertility, not so much from increased longevity, which is largely the reason other European populations have remained stable. Russia then is reviving with an upsurge in births that will give it the energy and drive and intellect to become a world leader again. Now that it is becoming a market economy, the West will benefit from its revival much more that it will from the emergence of China.</p>

		<p>Of course if there is political will the decline could be halted or even reversed. Just in Western countries our thoroughly Trotskyite elites wouldn&rsquo;t dream of it. I guess the Russians won&rsquo;t be living in such &#8216;interesting times&rsquo; as us Westerners will.</p>

		<p>But how many births were to &#8220;native&#8221; Slavic Orthodox Russians - and two at that?</p>
<p>Considering the high birth rates of the native Islamic Turkic peoples (conquered during Russia&rsquo;s imperial expansion), and that the population decline in Russia largely affects the aforementioned Slavic population, I very much doubt there&rsquo;s anything positive in this for the (original) Russians</p>

		<p>Other measures are always possible to increase population figures if that is the desire, besides bringing in malcontents who riot periodically and want constant freebies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true in every Western nation that uses the excuse of declining population to justify bringing in third world hordes who deplete their treasury and contribute nothing but crime and violence.</p>
<p>Then why do Western nations bring in third world hordes?  Because, of course, as we all know, the purpose is to reduce the white power base, and some of the main culprits who pursue that agenda is the ADL and the SPLC and those in academia who are brainwashed slugs, left over from the hippie generation, until white idiots outnumber the original schemers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, however, the mish mash of various third world tribes they encouraged to relocate are going to be exactly the reason these schemers are going to feel the full brunt of the coming the chaos that is almost upon us right now and will grow worse the further we get into 2010.</p>
<p>Clumsy, stupid and inept describe them best.  While they are great at deceit, manipulation and lying, they are woefully inadequate when it comes to projecting what the repercussions from their criminal conduct might be.  Or are they so arrogant they can&rsquo;t conceive of failure?</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.  Enpire America is finished, and we will realize that before this year ends.</p>

		<p> The World Population Clock puts the Russian population at 139 million and a few hundred thousand. Hopefully Putin&rsquo;s figures are the correct ones. To learn that a country the size of Russia, which is heavily Caucasian, is also gaining population, will be like finding a reservoir in the desert.</p>
<p> Now Putin needs to work on the heavy smoking and drinking (I believe production of alcohol is a government monopoly) that are sending Russian men in particular to their graves at an age not much older than that of Third World countries.</p>

		<p>One can rejoice that the Rusian population is increasing after years of demographic catastrophe.</p>
<p>The term &#8216;Russians&rsquo; here means all citizens of the Russian Federation, which is well over 10% Muslim. At a rough guess, anywhere bewteen 15% and a quarter of the &#8216;Russians&rsquo; being born are Muslims.</p>
<p>Depending on which figures one accepts, immense Russia now has a smaller population than tiny water-logged Bangladesh.</p>

		<p>The information &#8220;Russia&rsquo;s population statistics are rising&#8221; does not reveal how much the population growth is contributed by immigration and how much by white Slavs actually giving births to babies. Even though the news doesn&rsquo;t sound bad at all, it can&rsquo;t make me very optimistic, because Russia is still suffering from a low birth rate and a high mortality rate. Assuming that both numbers will stay the same over time, Russia&rsquo;s population is likely to halve in about 60 years. And we&rsquo;re talking about the TOTAL population that includes non-slavs from Central Asia and other countries; Talking at Slavs, numbers might even look worse. In the distant future, Russians (and I mean Slavic Russians) won&rsquo;t be able to maintain the size of their country, simply because there won&rsquo;t be enough population to occupy the entire country and to protect borders (of a total length of more than ten thousand miles) from the migration inflow of non-white migrants from the surrounding countries. Also take into account that the Islamic insurgency in Chechnya and Dagestan is threatening Caucasus and Russia.</p>

<p>The big question here is: What percentage of the 141.9 million are ethnic Russians, or for that matter at least Eastern Slavic (Russians, Byelorussians, and Ukrainians?) If the Chinese &ldquo;migrants&rdquo; into eastern Russia and Turkic Muslims that have sauntered into western Russia are making up the increase in population, PM Putin has little to be rejoicing about.</p>

		<p>My question is: why politicians and lawmakers permit so many inmigration? even though it is proven that its benefits are lower than its handicaps? Is there any secret conspiracy? The only answer I can imagine is that politicians want to increase its voters. For example, as it happenned in Spain with the socialist party: first we let thousands of people to come in, then politicians pass a law in order to give them papers. Inmigrants (now with papers),  would vote thankfully to politicians who gave them papers. That&rsquo;s my explanation in basic. What politicians don&rsquo;t know is that this trick may work with latinos, but it is unlikely to work with muslims, who stick to their creed. Is there any other explanations for this massive third world inmigration into Europe/US??? Please let me know.</p>

		<p><i>Is the population rise from ethnic Russians or immigrants muslims?</i></p>
<p>Tough to say, but we do know that the birthrate in the surrounding majority Muslim central Asian countries has plummeted in the last 15 years, in spite of the emigration of low fertility Russians.  Turkmenistan, for example, went from almost 4 children/woman in 1996 to 2.2 today.  Uzbekistan went from 3.7 to 1.9.  These are heavily Sunni countries where Islam is part of the school curriculum.</p>
<p>If the birth rate of Muslims in the surrounding countries has fallen during this time, I think it&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that the same has happened for Muslims within Russia&rsquo;s borders.  Yet Russia&rsquo;s birth rate has increased by 30 or 40 percent since the late 90s.  This increase would require several tens of millions of Muslim immigrants, when a place like Turkmenistan has less than 5 million inhabitants!  It seems more likely that the effect is a rebound of Slavic fertility, like some other eastern European nations are also experiencing.  Not a big enough rebound, but at least some reason for hope.</p>

		<p>I believe that much of this population boom is among the Slavic Russian peoples. I think the Amren readers are very very pessamistic all the time. I know one White Slav Russian man (Personally know him) who has 18 children. His brother has 15 children. They stay now near the Ukraine border. Country people they are. This is common these days in many country places in Russia. Also, western people I meet seem to believe that Muslim people in Russia are not white. Many are not (but even these Muslims would mostly be considered white if living in England or United States)this is true. But, I have met many white Muslim people in Russia. Many white slavic peoples convert to Islam through the years (centuries  back) In fact many people I know who are orthodox may look less white than many people I know that are Muslim. I am not trying to defend Islam or promote it. I am just saying the truth. I am only saying that white people in the English countries sometimes believe Muslims are only Arabic or African. This is not true. Just like you have have African Christians in Nigeria, South Africa, Jamaica, you  also have white Mulims in Russia, Albania, and former Yugoslav countries. This is about race, not religioun.</p>

		<p>Poster 21 is correct this is a genuine white birth boom. I studied this in university and EE countries birth rates declined massively in the 90s due to the collapse of the commie economy.<br>
The economic rebound, economic incentives and pro birth propaganda are the key drivers of the baby boom. Ultimately though people, well white people anyway, have babies when they feel economically secure. Make it financially safe through incentives.</p>

		<p>Please note that most of the Muslims in Russia are not immigrants, they were conquered, assimilated, slaughtered and expelled by Russians from their ancestral homelands, i.e. Crimean Tatars (perished in Siberia), Circassians (90% of them live in Turkey), other Turkic speaking people, etc&hellip; </p>
<p>Russia is not necessarily a White country. However, this is a good new, I don&rsquo;t want them to become extinct. Well done, Mr. Putin. Don&rsquo;t forget to fight heavy smoking and drinking too.</p>
