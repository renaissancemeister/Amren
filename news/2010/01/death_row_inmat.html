<h1>Death Row Inmate&rsquo;s Sentence Vacated</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jay Stapleton, News-Journal (Daytona Beach, Florida), January 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A local judge vacated the sentence of one of Volusia County&rsquo;s oldest death penalty cases, finding that Ted Herring&rsquo;s IQ is too low for him to be executed for killing a convenience store clerk in 1981.</p>
<p>Last month, Circuit Judge Joseph Will signed the order setting aside the death sentence, which had been handed down after Herring&rsquo;s trial in February 1982.</p>
<p>Circuit Judge S. James Foxman followed a jury&rsquo;s 8-4 recommendation that Herring be executed for shooting Norman Dale Hoeltzel in the left side of the head with a .22-caliber bullet.</p>
<p>Herring killed the clerk for $23.84 at the 7-Eleven at 705 S. Ridgewood Ave.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hoeltzel, 29, was working the nightshift when he was killed. Two men found his body on the floor in the store. In addition to the bullet wound to the head, he also was shot through his left hand and neck.</p>
<p>During the trial, prosecutor Gayle Graziano showed jurors testimony that Herring fired the second shot because Hoeltzel was still alive and he wanted no witnesses. Herring was suspected in several other armed robberies of convenience stores at the time.</p>
<p>In asking for the electric chair, Graziano reminded the jury of testimony that Herring told a parole officer Hoeltzel &#8220;got what he deserved for trying to play here; now there&rsquo;s one less cracker.&#8221;</p>
<p>Herring will remain on death row while appeal is pending.</p>
<p>If the order is affirmed, he&rsquo;ll be sentenced to life in prison. If the state wins its appeal, he could be put to death.</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;re truly retarded in a clinical sense, then you don&rsquo;t have the mental capability to formulate racial bigotry as a motive for murder.  I am of the opinion that true retards really don&rsquo;t have it in them to commit murder, hate motivated or not, at all.</p>

		<p>Not executing low I.Q. black murderers could mean almost all of them that commit murders, because their group average I.Q. is 85 which itself is almost mentally retarded.  Average I.Q. of black murderers probably is in the vicinity of 70 to 80&hellip;if that high.</p>
<p>Being mentally retarded doesn&rsquo;t mean the perp doesn&rsquo;t know right from wrong, so the law&hellip;as so many of them are&hellip;is a wrong headed one, but typical of what these mentally challenged fools in the state legislatures are doing now.<br/>

		<p>This was a hate crime.  The comments of the murderer prove it.</p>
<p>Whenever there is an anti-white racial element to a crime I believe that the liberals work extra hard to get the criminal off.</p>
<p>Liberals support anti-white racism.</p>
<p>The 15th of every month is &#8220;White Defense Day.&#8221;  On that day do something to build up white people or to oppose anti-white racism.  Also wear something white on that day to show unity and support.  Spread the word about &#8220;White Defense Day.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Was it Ann Coulter who once remarked &#8220;Liberals only believe in IQ tests when they&rsquo;re trying to save death row inmates from being executed.&#8221;?</p>
<p>Because every time racial differences show up in IQ and SAT scores the elitists claim that intelligence can&rsquo;t be measured scientifically.</p>

<p>Right, and the fact that it was said DOES prove that racial hate was on the mind of the killer at the time he committed the crime.</p>
<p>These cases always amaze me. It took NEARLY THIRTY YEARS TO DECIDE THIS?! What took so long? Prior to this, NO ONE could discern anything wrong, so how do they now?!</p>
<p>And in my experience, MOST whites in this country are not even aware of the perjorative term &#8220;cracker&#8221; and the meaning as used by blacks to describe whites. The white is not even aware he is being insulted when a black describes you as a &#8220;cracker&#8221;.</p>
<p>Chris Rock the so-called comedian uses that term a lot and it just sounds STUPID!!</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip; Being mentally retarded doesn&rsquo;t mean the perp doesn&rsquo;t know right from wrong&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly right Ice!</p>
<p>I have worked with the truly mentally retarded in a volunteer capacity and one thing that always struck me was how totally Honest and Honorable they are. No matter how severely mentally handicapped they are, they have an intrinsic and fierce sense of right and wrong and fair and un-fair.<br/>
Even the ones that could barely speak and needed help even dressing and eating showed this trait.</p>
<p>Blacks with an IQ of 70 are routinely classified as &#8220;retarded&#8221; by the &#8220;system&#8221;. They walk and talk normally (for blacks) and would pass as just &#8220;a little slow&#8221; if they weren&rsquo;t officially classified as &#8220;retarded&#8221;. They could hold down a full-time manual labor job if they wanted to, but most only work part-time if at all so as not to screw up thier SSI gravy train. <br/>
I work with a few that are like this and they drink malt likka, smoke weed and cigarettes and routinely throw a hissy-fit if they are asked to work more than 25 hours a week. If they work more than 25 hours in a week they don&rsquo;t get thier &#8220;gubmint&rsquo; cheese&#8221; that month.<br/>
(WHat? you&rsquo;re &#8220;smart enough&#8221; to wash dishes 25 hours a week but are too &#8220;retarded&#8221; to do it 30 hours?)</p>
<p>I suspect these are the same types that the liberal bed-wetters claim are &#8220;too retarded&#8221; to be punished when they rape, rob and murder White Women, but they are smart enough to obtain an illegal gun, put on a mask to disguise themselves, use gloves to prevent fingerprints etc, etc&hellip;..</p>
<p>Even &#8220;retarded&#8221; blacks know how to game the Liberal-White-Guilt system to thier advantage.</p>

		<p>Post #2 is right.  It was claimed that  racist serial killer Coral Eugene Watts had an IQ between 68 and 75, yet he was able to murder dozens and attack many others over a period of 8 years without getting caught.   </p>

		<p>So Ted Herring was smart enough to know that he wanted to kill the witness to his crime, but not smart enough to get the death penalty?  This is how liberals think.</p>

		<p>The irony in the whole line of reasoning that says he has too low of an IQ to be executed, is that he had enough of an IQ to execute someone else.  </p>
<p>He shot the clerk once, then had enough mental capacity to shoot him again so that there were no witnesses.  He knows the difference between alive and dead, obviously.  Besides, what does it matter if he (or anyone for that matter that has committed premeditated murder) has a low IQ?  If he knows the difference between dead and alive, then he deserves to bemoan the fact that he is going to be put to death.  If he DOESN&rsquo;T know the difference between alive and dead, then he won&rsquo;t know, or care, that he is being put to death.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s win, win if he&rsquo;s put to death, both for the grieving family members and the unwilling taxpayers that are supporting his free health care, meals, library, gymnasium, etc.</p>

		<p>One in 4 blacks are too &#8220;retarded&#8221; (of course, they are not retarded at all, they are normal for their race) to be eligible for the death penalty. (for whites, its ca one in 100, and they really are retarded, because no normal white can have an IQ of 75).</p>
<p>It never seems to strike liberals that if 25% of blacks in a given community are unemployed, it is not because of &#8220;racism,&#8221; but because people with IQs below 75 are essentially unemployable. </p>
<p>It is extraordinary that black unemployment isn&rsquo;t higher: I can&rsquo;t imagine hiring anyone with an IQ below 85.</p>
<p>Until we directly confront the core problem - low black average IQ and lowered inhibition to engage in violence - we will continue to flail around in confusion.</p>

		<p>About 20% of American blacks have an IQ of 70 or lower.  Many people in prison, of any ethnicity, are poor readers or non-readers.  And, of course, liberals don&rsquo;t want to talk about intelligence in regard to minorities; in fact, many usually discount the very existence of IQ.<br/>
It&rsquo;s irksome the way anti-death-penalty proponents, in order to stop several or even one execution, pick at reasons that have nothing to do with the basic argument.  In Ohio, they claimed that using only one lethal-injection drug (instead of about three) was cruel and unusual.  They lost.</p>

		<p>This story boggles my mind. We&rsquo;re talking about a coldblooded murder committed over a quarter of  a century ago and the courts in their infinite wisdom are just now getting around to considering whether this guy&rsquo;s IQ is too low for him to be executed? What have they been doing for the last quarter century? Besides drawing their six-figure salaries, I mean. Never mind the blatant hypocrisy involved when liberals deny the existence of IQ out of one side of their mouths while at the same time using IQ to try to save the lives of the sleaziest killers. The thing that really gets me is how long it takes for the so-called &#8220;justice system&#8221; to make the simplest decisions. You&rsquo;d think that this whole issue of mental competence would have been decided during the trial (no telling how long it took them to get around to that). I mean, how can anyone be sentenced to death without some kind of competence hearing or investigation? Not that I think a low IQ should be enough to void a death sentence. This guy is dumb and vicious and that makes him ten times as dangerous, if you ask me. </p>

		<p>I find it endlessly interesting that the left vehemently denies any IQ differences between blacks and whites, but immediately jump on IQ as a reason not to apply the death penalty any time it is awarded to a convicted black murderer.  Which way do they want it?</p>

		<p>To those of you rightfully questioning the liberal double standard: it is nothing new for  left-wingers to contradict themselves. They oppose the death penalty but support abortion. They say &#8220;affimative action/equal opportunity&#8221; in the same breath without noticing the irony. They claim to believe in diversity but are not likely to date or marry outside their race or live in integrated areas that are crime-ridden.</p>

		<p>The only ones who are retarded are the judges who let this guy off.</p>
<p>Actually, that is letting them off way to light.  The truth is they did it to let another murderer kill again and get rid of the deterrent for other blacks.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think that if the victim in this case had been an openly gay man, with his killer bragging afterward that there&rsquo;s &#8220;one less f****t in the world&#8221;, the sentence would never have been vacated.  The message this judge is sending is that it is completely OK to murder white people so long as they are heterosexuals.</p>
