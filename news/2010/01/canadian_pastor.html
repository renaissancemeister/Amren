			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Allen, Daily Telegraph (London), January 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Orphans in Haiti are being offered for sale to foreigners for as little as 30 pounds ($50 Cdn) amid warnings that up to one million children in the country have been left vulnerable to abuse and trafficking in the wake of the earthquake.</p>
<p>In a remote area north of the capital Port-au-Prince, a man was reported on Wednesday to have offered to sell a young boy for just $50.</p>
<p>The first confirmed case of a child being offered for sale since Haiti was devastated by a 7.0-magnitude earthquake on January 12 took place near Gonaives, 150km north of Port-au-Prince. It was reported by Noel Ismonin, a Canadian pastor who rescues orphans in the area. A man offered to sell him the boy but the pastor refused.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in camps around the capital there were several reports of men being lynched after being accused by earthquake victims of trying to steal infants from tents.</p>
<p>The incident raised fears that child trafficking gangs could move into poor rural areas that have yet to be properly reached by aid agencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are an estimated one million unaccompanied or orphaned children, or children who lost one parent,&#8221; said Kate Conradt, a spokesman for Save the Children. &#8220;They are extremely vulnerable.&#8221;</p>
<p>A group of 78 children sleeping in the street outside their shattered orphanage are being guarded at night by local people. The bodies of 56 other children remain buried under the collapsed Notre Dame de la Nativite orphanage in the Carrefour slum area of the capital.</p>
<p>The youngest victims, Cedric Francois and James Alcius, were both just five months old. Of the survivors, many had wounds to their heads and limbs. They sleep on blankets laid in the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it rains it will be terrible,&#8221; said Eveline Louis-Jacques, 61, who runs the orphanage.</p>
<p>Vanessa Line, three, was rescued after spending two days stuck in the rubble. She stares blankly ahead and does not speak, clearly traumatized by her ordeal.</p>
<p>Naika Simon, six, who suffered head wounds when timber fell on her, said: &#8220;It hurt me and I was crying. I could hear others crying as well. It was dark and I was scared. I miss my mummy and daddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The orphanages have become targets for people desperate for food, water and medicine. Maison de Lumiere, which has 50 orphans, came under attack from a group of 20 armed men but security guards drove them off.</p>
<p>Charities and aid agencies are only supplying the orphanages with a few days of food and water at a time in case they are looted.</p>
<p>Ann Barnes, who worked for the UN in Haiti, has been named as the second British victim of the earthquake.</p>
<p>Barnes, 59, was originally from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, and was personal assistant to the UN Police Commissioner.<br>

		<p>And by all means, let millions of these Hatians into the USA; don&rsquo;t let go of the illegal Hatians already here; keep every African we can get!<br>
Doesn&rsquo;t anyone remember mom&rsquo;s admonitions to avoid bad company? Didn&rsquo;t mom tell us that even though WE may be smart and decent, that hanging around bad or stupid people leads to bad consequences?<br>
How can our government, and Liberal fools forget such common sense?<br>
It always applies. <br>
Why would the USA want to keep importing people from a society that are as low, craven, helpless/predatory, as Haitians?<br>
No, really, why? We want people that sell babys for 50$ ?<br>
We want people that can&rsquo;t get out of the stone age?<br>
ARGH!</p>

		<p>Welcome to Africa. Yout want black, you get black.<br>
In Europe it is the same:<br>
Belgium was one of most secure areas in whole Europe only 10 years ago. Today it is one of the blackest and most unsecure, poorest area. Nobody can today tell a white Belgium that Diversity is good. Sweden was having one of the best school systems und social systems in the whole world. Today they are thinking about changing it after the &#8220;cultural enrichment by imigrants&#8221; cause so many (imigrants) fail.<br>
Now nearly all european countries are getting more right. Right parties are growing everywhere. </p>

		<p>Of course, this kind of thing was going on in Haiti before the quake.  Almost every awful thing you hear about the country&rsquo;s situation is pre-quake and will continue.</p>

		<p>Slavery flourishes in Haiti (their name for slaves is &#8220;restavecs&#8221;) as it does in many parts of the Third World: Chad, Mauretania&hellip;. Of course, this attracts little attention in the West from minorities and white liberals. However, if the slaveowners were *white,* I think the situation would be seen in another light. Far better to focus on the pre-Civil War South, where as many as one in twenty Confederate soldiers owned slaves.</p>

		<p>Those thugs probably cannot believe the fact that there are actually idiotic naive people who would want to adopt those children. That does not stop them from trying to make quick bucks out of it though. </p>
<p>Blacks have a tendency to ruthlessly exploit and enslave the weak. There is no way White people and black people can ever live together. The nature of White people is exactly the opposite. Even people in places like India or Mexico are far less exploitative than blacks.<br>
