<h1><a href="http://newsmax.com/US/US-Colleges-Earning-Degrees/2010/01/28/id/348240">State Universities Want More Students to Graduate</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Newsmax, January 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For years, American colleges and universities have focused on getting more students to seek higher education. Now they want to make sure more of their students leave campus with a diploma.</p>
<p>Despite deep cuts in state funding, public university systems around the country are launching campaigns to boost graduation rates, especially among low-income and minority students who trail their classmates in earning degrees.</p>
<p>California State University, the nation&rsquo;s largest four-year system with 23 campuses and more than 400,000 students, on Wednesday announced an ambitious initiative to increase the percentage of students who graduate in six years, from 46 percent to 54 percent by 2016.</p>
<p>But some question whether Cal State and other public institutions can reach their goals when state budget cuts have led to big tuition hikes, fewer instructors and course sections, and more difficulty getting into classes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cal State is one of 24 state university systems that have pledged to close the gap in graduation rates between low-income, minority students and their classmates. Together those systems enroll more than three million students and about 20 percent of the country&rsquo;s undergraduates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nationwide, about 54 percent of full-time students at four-year public universities graduate in six years, but the rate is 43 percent for Hispanics and 38 percent for blacks, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.</p>
<p>College officials say students drop out of college for a variety of reasons, including poor academic preparation, lack of money and inability to get required classes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, which has 117,000 students, is working on a new plan to improve its six-year graduation rate, which is 58 percent for all students but 38 percent for under-represented minorities, said spokesman Kenn Marshall.</p>
<p>At the University of Louisiana system, where the graduation rate is 38 percent overall and 29 percent for under-represented minorities, officials are trying to boost those numbers by raising admissions standards, redesigning courses and improving academic counseling, said spokeswoman Jackie Tisdell.</p>
<p>Eric Fingerhut, chancellor of the University System of Ohio, said past efforts to narrow the academic gap in his state fell short, but he hopes the broader alliance will provide more momentum.</p>
<p>&#8220;States have had efforts like this before,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We barely got enough money to keep the doors open and the heat on, let alone make progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>In California, the CSU is launching its graduation initiative at a time when deep budget cuts have forced the system to furlough faculty, cut teaching staff, slash course offerings, raise tuition by more than 30 percent and reduce enrollment by 40,000 students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>CSU campuses will try to boost graduation rates by requiring students to meet with academic advisors, declare majors earlier and attend remedial classes in the summer before freshman year. Campuses may also change degree requirements and create &#8220;learning communities&#8221; that help students feel more connected to their schools, officials said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lillian Taiz, a CSU history professor who heads the system&rsquo;s faculty staff, worries the goals may prompt schools to water down curriculums or turn away weaker students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Setting this kind of goal without the resources you need to deliver a quality education is risky and leads to the temptation to take shortcuts and use gimmicks,&#8221; Taiz said.<br/>

<p>Yes, but what good is an affirmative action degree when they don&rsquo;t know the subject they get accreditation in?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many times, just this last year, I&rsquo;ve heard blacks scream racism, bias, prejudice, etc., when they have difficulty getting a job, because it is so apparent to the job interviewer the AA applicant doesn&rsquo;t know what he/she is supposed to know, along with a poor ability to express themselves adequately.  And I don&rsquo;t mean just &#8220;talk.&#8221;  But &#8220;express themselves adequately,&#8221; because most all blacks can bray non-stop on anything, but they come across as uneducated.</p>
<p>These colleges right now hand out AA degrees like pamphlets.   Any furtherance of the policy will mean they&rsquo;ve reduced their credibility even more.<br/>

		<p>CA lost its university credibility when it started admitting unqualified minorities.  When I went to college, there WERE no &#8220;remedial&#8221; classes; if you needed that, you didn&rsquo;t belong in college/university.  I say that is still true.  People who need remediating need to go to a less-demanding learning environment, like one of the &#8220;colleges&#8221; that prepares the person for a career in 9 months to 2 years.  Academia is NOT for the masses - it&rsquo;s for the most intelligent people, the ones who learn quickly, and lesser-abled folks need to stay out of this level where they don&rsquo;t belong.</p>

		<p>This is another example of how democratization in general does damage. The results of the supposed goal of equal opportunity turns out to be equality of <i>outcome.</i> The dumb benefit from the dumbing down; the rest of us must suffer the results. </p>

		<p>Imagine the far-reaching effects of removing all the obstacles to achievement (in this case, obtaining a college degree). The achievement becomes worthless.<br/>
It has always been a natural law, that organizations, schools, companies, societies, set up hoops and bars to jump through and over, on the upward path to success. Otherwise, anybody could stumble backwards into positions of power.<br/>
So much for  meritocracy, huh?<br/>
Well, I would now say a university degree- including phDs and MDs, are worthless.<br/>
I&rsquo;d never go back and obtain another baccalaureate or graduate degree&hellip;I&rsquo;d be ashamed to study in the presence of morons (and I&rsquo;m just talking about the administrators). And I dropped out of high school early to go to college, and escape the teenage morons (who I must say, were quite smart, just immature). Now, I&rsquo;d be in the company of young adult morons who never could have gotten out of junior high in my day. And that was just 20 years ago.<br/>
COLLEGE IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY. DON&rsquo;T GO. MAKE YOUR OWN WAY OUTSIDE OF THE ILLUSORY &#8220;SYSTEM.&#8221; THERE IS NOTHING IN THE OFFING FOR YOU IF YOU DUMP 50K INTO A &#8220;DEGREE.&#8221; BILL GATES HAS MADE SURE YOU WON&rsquo;T HAVE ANY PROGRAMMING JOB, INSOURCING THIRD WORLD &#8220;DOCTORS&#8221; HAS MADE SURE YOU&rsquo;D NEVER GET GOOD PAY OR RESPECT AS A PHYSICIAN&hellip;need I say more?<br/>
Oh yeah, to hell with diversity.</p>

		<p>The latest proposals that are starting to circulate are that high schools should not only be accountable for getting &#8220;All&#8221; students into college, but that high schools should be obligated to keep track of their students in their first year of college.  High school teachers will then be judged on the success of their students in colleges!  Imagine that.</p>

		<p>California has to hire the Wizard of Oz to run the system. He would get it down: as a practical matter, since businesses and other organizations need Diversity, competence is irrelevant. So, as the Wizard would say &#8220;You don&rsquo;t need a brain, all you need is a diploma!&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Getting more students to graduate?  Piece of cake, only admit those who can.  Deny admission to those who are unlikely to survive a semister there.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ll have to cheat to get them through or, as in Berkley High, do away with science and math classes. Give me a break. Why can&rsquo;t the colleges just make the ACT (at least 18 or above) or SAT scores the means to get in and then the students that really should be in college, whites included, would be there. They would be prepared to continue discoveries in technology, medicine, and become writers of distinction. The way it is now, any moron can get a diploma, especially if the tax-payer is financing the studies. </p>

		<p>Education is a help to everyone, but it should not be done at the expense of quality, which is what has been going on since the late 1960s.</p>
<p>California also had its education budget cut drastically by Reagan during his govenorship.  One result was the exchange of educators.  The more qualified had to flee the state while less qualified were hired to teach at lower wages.  Dumb social experiments like bilingual education, and historical revision became commonplace.  For example - Today hardly any community college offers classical humanities, as it was taught in the 1970s.  Educational results went down from there.  Professor Alan Bloom wrote a great book about this called, &#8220;The Closing of the American Mind.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I knew a senior professor who insisted that either he or a trusted colleague teach the intro course to his department, to ensure that no dullards or slackers passed.  He felt the task of culling was too important to be left to grad student lecturers.   </p>

		<p>A UC Santa Cruz alumnus, I used to receive frequent emails from them begging me for money.  I recently emailed them back, telling them I was absolutely delighted at California&rsquo;s financial troubles, and that perhaps the university system there could save money by immediately firing everyone with the word &#8220;diversity&#8221; as part of their job title.  I continued that begging a white male for money while do-nothing, multi-cultist diversitoids feed at the public trough seemed monumentally inappropriate.</p>
<p>I still send them the occasional message in which I gloat over their continued problems.</p>
