<h1>Martin Luther King Jr. Lesson Sparks Concerns About Discrimination</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elvia Aguilar, Corpus Christi Caller-Times, January 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An activity meant to honor Martin Luther King Jr. at Sinton&rsquo;s Smith Middle School that separated students based on eye color generated concerns of discrimination for some, and parents will receive a letter this week explaining the exercise, the district superintendent said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students in coach Robert Mounts&rsquo; physical education class with brown eyes were asked to perform a normal warm-up that is used in physical education two or three times each week. Students with green or blue eyes watched, VanMatre [Steve VanMatre, Sinton Independent School District superintendent] said. They were separated by eye color, not race, he said.</p>
<p>The exercise is similar to an experiment first performed in 1968 by a third-grade teacher in Iowa.</p>
<p>Mounts has written a letter to parents explaining the exercise, which will be delivered this week.</p>
<p>He wrote: &#8220;At the conclusion of the warm-up activities I explained the purpose of the separation of the students and gave small narrative about Martin Luther King and his importance in the civil rights movement and the importance of the civil rights movements in the lives of today&rsquo;s youth.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>VanMatre has received five or six phone calls from parents concerned that Mounts&rsquo; actions were discriminating to Hispanics, blacks or those with dark colored eyes. He explained to parents that the activity&rsquo;s intent wasn&rsquo;t to discriminate but educate students on the experience of being a minority.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>n 1968, Jane Elliot developed the blue eyes/brown eyes exercise to teach discrimination to her third-grade class in an all-white school after King&rsquo;s assassination. The exercise at first allowed the blue-eyed children to be superior, while brown-eyed children were inferior. The next day, the brown-eyed children were superior to the blue-eyed children.</p>

		<p>This exercise and variants thereon is as old as the hills.  Why didn&rsquo;t the people in charge send the letter BEFORE the exercise was performed and just tell the parents not to tell the kids?  As a former teacher, I know that if you advise people in advance, you can do a lot of things that would be protested if you didn&rsquo;t tell them until after the fact.  Somebody&rsquo;s common sense took a hike&hellip;</p>

		<p>I believe the racist, anti-White &#8216;experiments&rsquo; conducted on children by the odious Jane Elliot to be child abuse.</p>
<p>If that were one of my kids, all hell would break loose.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the noxious Queen of Diversity&rsquo;s brand of &#8216;training&rsquo; is THE prevailing wisdom in American schools and corporations to this day.</p>
<p>From a Jane Elliot interview (2003):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I think white people aren&rsquo;t aware that racism isn&rsquo;t just wearing white hoods and burning crosses. It&rsquo;s also fixing the system so that black votes don&rsquo;t get counted.  It&rsquo;s refusing to open the polling places in precincts where most of the eligible voters are people of color. It&rsquo;s outlawing affirmative action at the state level even though it has proven successful. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s building more prisons than we build schools and guaranteeing that they will be filled by targeting young men of color with things like the &#8216;three strikes&rsquo; legislation in California, and the DWB   &mdash;   &#8216;driving while black.&rsquo; </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s white flight&hellip; It&rsquo;s television programming that portrays people of color as villains and white people as their victims. It&rsquo;s ballot-security systems, which are used to intimidate minority voters and so result in the very activities which they are supposedly designed to prevent.</p>
<p>We give culturally biased IQ tests in the classrooms every day all over this country, and children of color are routinely expected to pass them&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/r8jm</p>
<p>Yet if any White deigned to challenge any one of these blatant, anti-White lies, he would be shouted down, called a Nazi and put his career at risk. </p>

		<p>Instead of using the &#8220;eye color experiment&#8221; to push a flawed ideology on gullible junior high students, why not try it on urban taxi drivers,who routinely practice &#8220;racial discrimination&#8221; in order to live to drive another day .</p>

I have been arguing with people for at least 25 years about race issues and I&rsquo;ve never been shouted down or called a Nazi and most of these debates are at work and even during &#8220;Diversity Training.&#8221;<br>
If anyone is waiting for the MSM to &#8220;wake our people up&#8221; we are going to have a long wait. A lot of white people really have fallen for the anti-white lies put out by the MSM and we should not be afraid to try to give our people the facts.</p>

		<p>The eye color discrimination exercise was outright stupid. Arbitrary physical differences are not the motivation for segregation. Historically in the US, segregation was practiced to keep a relatively law abiding, productive segment of the population from being raped, beaten, robbed, or otherwise inconvenienced by the lawless, vicious segments of the population. It just so happens that race is a good way to identify the lawless, vicious segments.</p>
<p>I like to point out that since the end of segregation 1.6 million white women have been raped by black men in this country. White men have hardly repaid black women the favor, according to The Color of Crime Report prepared by this website, with the phenomena of white on black rape being almost non-existent. But since the average American hasn&rsquo;t read The Color of Crime, they couldn&rsquo;t understand how utterly preposterous the accusations by Crystal Magnum&rsquo;s against the Duke Lacrosse team were.</p>

		<p>3 Bon says that if you challenge anti-White lies, you will be called a Nazi.  5 George00 says that no one has ever called him a Nazi.  I&rsquo;d guess that it depends on where you live and what sort of work you do.  In my own situation, I would be harassed out of my job to openly defend White as a race.  I always put the issues in terms of social class, which not only keeps the anti-Whites from accusing me of racism, it leaves them unable to respond at all.  </p>

		<p>I think one of the tactics of the eye color game in class is to herd brown eyed whites in with brown eyed blacks and hispanics, leaving the genetically whitest of all, the blue, green, hazel, and other light variations in a distinct minority.  It is an excercise aimed at intimidation of whites in a completely Machiavellian way.</p>

<p>I am delighted to hear that Whites are able to challenge diversity trainers in an open setting in certain workplaces and not be in fear of losing their jobs.</p>
<p>Not so in academia where those who do not agree with the standard party lies are attacked physically, shouted down or prevented from speaking  &mdash;  ask Professors Rushton, or Michael Levin or author David Horowitz, ( of &#8220;Ten Reasons Why Reparations for Slavery are a Bad Idea  &mdash;  And Racist, Too)&#8221; :</p>
<p>&#8221;..[Levin and Rushton] have been physically threatened because of their work on race and IQ. Doctor Rushton has actually been physically attacked. Mr. Levin has been given a body guard. Both have had classes disrupted&hellip;. Both have been threatened with job loss, loss of research funds, loss of tenure, and have had an absence of support from colleagues&hellip;Attempts were made to criminally prosecute Doctor Rushton, a Canadian, under hate crime laws&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Mr. Horowitz has faced death threats, and requires a bodyguard&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>In the educational-industrial machine, where I work, the one that brainwashes the next generation of children to be drones of the state, I would put my career at risk by challenging &#8216;diversity goddesses&rsquo; such as Jane Elliot.  This type of training is ongoing and mandatory and we are expected to disseminate lies such as &#8216;diversity is strength!&rsquo;, &#8216;there are no differences in intelligence!&rsquo;, &#8216;blacks perform poorly because of White racism!&rsquo; back into the classrooms where we teach.</p>
<p>Mentioning differences in IQ between the races would be career suicide.</p>
<p>And, for the record, I have been shouted down  &mdash;  once was enough.  And I have been called a Nazi.</p>
<p>I once, about a decade ago, stood up to challenge a White diversity trainer who presented a video about a very successful black school that was touting its wonderful &#8216;successes&rsquo; with poor, inner-city, black children   &mdash;  a methodology that we were going to be trained to emulate because &#8216;these particular tactics&rsquo; had worked so well with children who were &#8216;destined to be failures.&rsquo;  It turned out the students were heavily screened and only one in 14 was accepted (the rejects, of course, are sent to the public schools, along with any kid who doesn&rsquo;t succeed in the private school&rsquo;s program  &mdash;  usually they&rsquo;re kicked out right before the state tests).</p>
<p>I stood up and asked how a public school could possibly be compared to or emulate a small private school that had the luxury of cherry-picking the very best students from the surrounding community.  </p>
<p>(On a side note, this is how &#8216;super-teacher&rsquo; Jaime Escalante was able to succeed in teaching calculus to poor hispanic children  &mdash;   he vetted and hand-picked a small number of students for his &#8216;advanced mathematics&rsquo; class from a student body of about 3,500).</p>
<p>After I made my comment, all hell broke loose. Blacks started pointing their fingers at me and screaming that all black students had the potential to be &#8216;as good and smart as White students&rsquo; all black students were &#8216;at promise&rsquo;, &#8216;black failure was due to Whites wanting to keep blacks down.&rsquo;  I am not kidding and I am not making this up.    </p>
<p>No one, not one person, came to my defense  &mdash;  only later, safely away from the training, behind closed doors and when privacy was completely assured, did other Whites come forward and tell me they agreed completely with me.</p>
<p>Such is the Reign of Terror under which we in the K-12 and higher educational system must work.</p>
<p>After that experience, I learned to tune out diversity trainers or near-illiterate &#8216;educational experts&rsquo; who spout off about White racism being the cause of low black test scores and black failure, biased tests, and IQ being meaningless.  The big push now is to eliminate SAT and ACT tests as requirements for college admission  &mdash;  precisely because the achievement gap is ongoing and intractable.</p>
<p>Any and every excuse you can imagine EXCEPT THE ONE THAT IS THE TRUTH is put forth in these sessions as to why blacks and hispanics cannot achieve at the level of Whites and Asians.   Woe be to anyone who challenges this dogma.</p>

Joe is absolutely right on this one. There is a local diner that has a reputation for being &#8220;racist.&#8221;  It is not dark skin that my waitress friend objects to. It is the fact that they rarley tip and they are rude and demanding.  It is behavior, not skin color that is the issue.</p>

		<p>When whites or conservatives do it, it&rsquo;s the greatest evil in the sadly sordid history of mankind. When liberals or non-whites do it, it&rsquo;s considered enlightenment and the highest of scholarship and ironically, an exercise in &#8216;consciousness raising&rsquo;. Meaning education designed to convince us of the need to discriminate even more. </p>

		<p>Wow - Sinton, county seat of San Patricio County.  My wife&rsquo;s from San Patricio County, and her dad&rsquo;s a judge in Sinton.  He&rsquo;s a left-winger, but he does have blue eyes, so it will be interesting to see how this plays out if it goes to court, as it should.  This is blatantly illegal.</p>

Talking about race and IQ at Diversity Training when there are blacks in the room is almost a guaranteed way to start a bad scene. <br>
What I&rsquo;m mainly talking about is white people talking to white people, one on one, and trying to give them the facts and arguments to counter the &#8220;anti-White lies&#8221; put out by the MSM. It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to preach to the choir. If you pick the right person and place every race realist has no excuse to not try to convince the opposition.   </p>

		<p>The reign of terror will intensify as the less qualified receives more and more empowerment from liberals, esteem that is baseless and praise that is undeserved.</p>
<p>We have sacrificed our nations&rsquo; morals, culture, intellect,  and our nations industry on AA and EEOC, false science and left wing policies.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here?  try the truth and vote out all incumbents, and all anti American politicans and teachers.  Take back our country and recall the policies that have made us weak and useless.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>
