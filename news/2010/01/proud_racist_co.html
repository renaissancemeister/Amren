			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ann M. Simmons, Los Angeles Times, January 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Santa Clarita councilman&rsquo;s shout-out at a recent anti-illegal immigration rally that he is a &#8220;proud racist&#8221; has ignited an angry war of words in a suburban community over whether the longtime civic leader is a hatemonger who should be driven from office or a patriot unafraid to speak out for fellow Americans.</p>
<p>Bob Kellar, a veteran councilman and two-time mayor, said his words have been taken out of context, but he declined to offer an apology at a City Council meeting Tuesday night.</p>
<p>But the remark, which was posted in a video on You Tube and quickly spread across the blogosphere, has set off a firestorm. As protesters carrying signs milled outside the council meeting, dozens of Santa Clarita residents jumped on the issue. Many applauded Kellar when he strode into the meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are invading us, and colonizing us .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and we taxpayers are footing the bill for them,&#8221; lifelong Santa Clarita resident and Minutemen member Robert Crooks, 59, said of undocumented workers. For the last five years, Crooks said, he has volunteered as a sentry on the U.S.-Mexico border in Tecate, keeping watch for border-hoppers.</p>
<p>Bruce McFarland, a political organizer and 32-year resident of the Santa Clarita Valley, called Kellar &#8220;an embarrassment&#8221; and urged the council to censure him, which elicited boos and expletives from the audience.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The support for Kellar, a U.S. Army veteran who served 25 years with the Los Angeles Police Department, focused attention on the simmering tensions over the effect of illegal immigration in this predominantly white and largely conservative northern Los Angeles County city.</p>
<p>Population statistics published by the city for 2008 show that close to 70% of Santa Clarita&rsquo;s population of 177,045 is white. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Forty people living in one house and destroying our neighborhood and quality of life, emergency rooms with standing room only and no one speaking English, day laborers standing all over our streets taking a toll on our businesses and traffic,&#8221; Kellar wrote [in a written response published Tuesday in a local newspaper,]. &#8220;That describes some of the issues on a local basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many residents who defended Kellar&rsquo;s &#8220;proud racist&#8221; remark said they would crack down harder and wished undocumented immigrants would leave the city and country. Several blamed them for an upswing in crime and for drug- trafficking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Illegals are here at the expense of our community,&#8221; said Santa Clarita Valley businessman Larry Rasmussen. &#8220;I agree with Bob. Our nation is a nation of laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>The few residents who spoke out against Kellar at Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting accused the councilman of spreading hatred. Some called Kellar&rsquo;s remarks &#8220;disgraceful&#8221; and suggested that the councilman at least apologize. Kellar told reporters he had no regrets over his remarks.</p>

		<p>this is excellent, it&rsquo;s about time. Whites who have had to live with and deal with illegal immigrants have learned that they have to stand up for themselves. This is my favorite part: &#8220;Bruce McFarland, a political organizer and 32-year resident of the Santa Clarita Valley, called Kellar &ldquo;an embarrassment&rdquo; and urged the council to censure him, which elicited boos and expletives from the audience.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Santa Clarita is a textbook example of how quickly a neighborhood can turn.  I lived there from 1996 through 2000 and moved out as soon as my &#8220;rule of ten&#8221; was reached.  That means when I am able to count ten nonwhite faces in a day I move on.  From the day I counted my first until the day I could easily count 10 was much less than a year.  I guess once the word gets out the flood gates open.</p>
<p>My understanding is that the rapidity was kind of an influenced behavior, with the primary landholder of the area (Newhall Land and Farm) establishing the lion&rsquo;s share of the required section 8 housing in Canyon Country/Santa Clarita as a sacrifice to leave their cash cow (neighboring Valencia) unmolested.  That idea failed, and now Valencia is one of the nicest towns you&rsquo;ll ever be menaced in.</p>
<p>I took a look at my old house on Google Street View and it is painted a bright yellow.  I can only imagine who is living there.</p>

<p>This IMO, is what it will take to end this attempt to silence Whites. Most Whites cower in fear at the thought of being branded a racist. A White can be totally ruined by accusations of racism. And even when Whites grovel at Jesse or Al&rsquo;s feet for forgiveness, it usually isn&rsquo;t forthcoming. When enough Whites who are accused of racism, bigotry, spreading hate, etc, stand up and tell the race hustlers to shove it, like Mr Kellar did, this anti White bigotry will end. But as long as there are plenty of Whites who play along with this nonsense, there will be plenty of race baiters to take advantage of them for the most minor, most innocent of PERCEIVED slights.<br>

		<p>Couldn&rsquo;t have said it better myself!  My niece owns a condo in Santa Clarita, and has had a VERY hard time with nonwhite tenants refusing to pay rent, and screwing her out of a lot of money since landlord/tenancy laws in CA are written in favor of the tenants.  My niece is smart, but she hadn&rsquo;t counted on HAVING to rent to nonwhites and then having them get away with not paying the rent.  So good for Bob - may he and others like him take control of the situation! </p>

		<p>We should heed the cautious advice of Sam Francis in the May 1999 newsletter.</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8216;Racism,&rsquo; therefore, is a term originating on the left, and has been so defined and loaded with meanings the left wants it to have that it cannot now be used by the supporters of white racial consciousness for any constructive purpose. Anyone who uses the term to descibe himself or his own views has already allowed himself to be maneuvered onto his opponents&rsquo; ground and has already lost the debate. He may try to define the word differently, but he will need to spend most of his time explaining that he does not mean by it what everyone else means.&#8221;</p>

		<p>50 years ago the worst thing to be called was a communist. People lost their jobs and had their lives ruined. Today people pass the word &#8220;communist&#8221; around like it&rsquo;s a laughable joke.</p>
<p>Whenever anyone calls me a racist, I never apologize. Instead I laugh and say, &#8220;yes I&rsquo;m a racist but I&rsquo;m an equal opportunity racist. I do not believe in discrimination.&#8221; ^_^</p>
<p>If enough people stand firm instead of cowering in fear of being called a racist then the word will lose it&rsquo;s effect. One day the word racist will become like the word communist.</p>

		<p>I suspect that in the fairly near future we&rsquo;ll be seeing more and more people willing to publicly state the obvious about certain minority populations.</p>
<p>Forty years ago there was a very broad and strong concensus in this country that certain minorities were finally due a fair, or even more than fair, shake.</p>
<p>Very few people still believe that all minority problems are due to white racism.  Such people are now a small minority; the majority are now more than weary of incessant minority demands, minority incapacity, minority criminality, and the vast costs minorities now impose in this nation.</p>
<p>Tough economic times have hugely exacerbated this growing public sentiment.  An urban riot spilling over into middle class neighborhoods may provide a most unpleasant surprise for unruly and violent minorities.</p>
<p>The recent explosive growth in sales of guns and ammunition in this nation is motivated by far more than fear of government confiscation.  It&rsquo;s largely a response to fear of black and Hispanic disruption and violent crime, especially disruption and crime trying to spread beyond minority traditional neighborhoods.</p>

		<p>I live near Santa Clarita.</p>
<p>Santa Clarita is at the far end of Los Angeles County, 35 miles from downtown, referred to as an &#8216;edge city&rsquo; by Wikipedia  &mdash;  forcing long, daily commutes over jammed freeways for many residents.</p>
<p> Santa Clarita, in large part, was settled by Whites who were forced to flee from other areas of LA as their neighborhoods became unlivable and dangerous due to a massive flood of fecund, unskilled, uneducated hispanics from the Third World.</p>
<p>You can imagine the anger these people feel (Keller says his supporters outnumber the detractors 10-one) as the schools in their previous neighborhoods became dangerous and their own White children marginalized.  This is the main reason they moved to Santa Clarita in the first place  &mdash;  and here it is again, happening just as it did before.</p>
<p>They well know the end result and are aware of what will happen if they don&rsquo;t take a stance, which it appears they&rsquo;re doing  &mdash;  with Keller as the catalyst.</p>
<p>Keller (in an interview yesterday) said a day doesn&rsquo;t go by that furious local residents either show up, e mail or call his office to complain of day laborers cat calling to their young daughters, openly urinating in the streets, hanging out in front of legitimate businesses effectively shutting them down, living forty to a house (with the housing and/or health department unresponsive), lowering YOUR property value, making your home unlivable and unsalable and your neighborhood undesirable.  </p>
<p>Keller says his main issue is the loss of the quality of life in Santa Clarita.</p>
<p>If anything, non-Whites will get the message (via all the free lame-stream publicity) that Santa Clarita is NOT a welcoming place for fecund Third World, welfare-dependent non-Whites  &mdash;   that it is full of racist, unwelcoming, Third-World hating Whites.</p>
<p> Let&rsquo;s hope Keller sets a precedence for other Whites that are sick and tired of the Third World colonization of their cities.</p>
<p>And remember those of you who don&rsquo;t live here:  California is the leading edge of what is coming YOUR way, sooner than you think.  Prepare yourselves not to fall victim to our fate.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t define youself with a silly &#8216;ism-term&rsquo; invented by leftists. It would be like a man labelling himself &#8216;sexist&rsquo; at some sort of women&rsquo;s issues debate (ultimately pointless and you&rsquo;ll probably end up with a headache);as Mr Francis rightly stated (to reiterate):</p>

		<p>&#8220;I agree with Bob. Our nation is a nation of laws.&#8221; Wrong! we ceased being a nation of laws when the first illegal alien was allowed to stay in this county. Since then, the sound of laws being broken reverberates all over this nation. </p>
<p>Three cheers for Mr. Kellar. If we had more speaking up like he did,we might just have a chance to avoid becoming a third world country, but it will take courage and in Washington, that&rsquo;s a virtue in short supply.</p>

		<p>While I like the Council member&rsquo;s spunk,I think the words of Sam Francis definitely apply. Calling oneself a &#8220;racist&#8221; is just putting yourself on the wrong footing.</p>
<p>Speaking of terms, I also believe that the word, &#8220;European-American,&#8221; especially if &#8220;African-American&#8221; sticks for blacks, is the best way of letting people know that we are living in the U.S., yet are proud of all the centuries of Western Civilization that developed in Europe before our ancestors moved to North America.</p>

		<p>Being racist means you have a better idea of human nature and of how the world works. Being racist is natural human nature. Nothing to be ashamed of. Indeed people who do not believe in racial differences should be ridiculed for being stupid, childish, hypocrites etc&hellip; All non-White races are racists, only Whites are denied this natural behaviour. </p>

		<p>One of my coworkers (who is black, by the way,) rented an apartment in Santa Clarita recently. She complained rather bitterly about all the Section 8 tenants who got to live in the same building she lived in, but didn&rsquo;t have to pay as much as she did.  She also said they were nothing but trouble, causing frequent police visits, police helicopters circling overhead, etc.</p>

<p>No, nowadays it simply means &#8220;Whites who want to live among their own kind&#8221;. </p>
<p>THAT, and that alone, is the &#8216;sin&rsquo; that is now described as &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So white people who simply want non-involvement with other races - i.e. to simply live with their own kind, are &#8220;racists&#8221;? That&rsquo;s like calling a woman who refuses a man&rsquo;s sexual advances a &#8220;sexist&#8221;.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Racism&#8221; can be defined however you want it.  There are a million definitions.  That&rsquo;s yours.  I suppose it is closer to white supremacy.  Personally, I don&rsquo;t see that inferior or superior, better or worse, are relevant issues here.  I don&rsquo;t make a big thing of them.  I try not to be negative or arrogant.  If my people are better, that&rsquo;s nice, but I don&rsquo;t brag about it.  [Better at WHAT?]   And some others may be better (smarter, handsomer, healthier, whatever) than I am. That&rsquo;s OK too. We all have distinct qualities. A Bolivian Indian is better (than I am) at surviving at a high altitude.  And an Eskimo at surviving in low temperatures. An Australian aborigine can survive in a blazing desert that would scorch my skin to a crisp.   I admit that. They are better at what they are evolved to do.</p>
<p>I am a &#8220;racist&#8221; in that I care about and look out for the welfare of my  &#8220;race&#8221; because it&rsquo;s mine   &mdash;   the same way I would look out for my family (because it&rsquo;s mine, not because it&rsquo;s better that anyone else on the street).  As with my family,  I am concerned primarily for my own race, but NOT to the detriment of other races, nor bearing them any ill will.   No more so than I would wish harm on my other neighbors on the block, but I still put my own family first. </p>
<p>In an extended sense, my race is my family.  But I am also a human being, and that is my species.  Are we evil because we care for ourselves and for our own kind?  That is the first  law of nature   &mdash;   to look out for yourself.   We can be concerned for all races,  but still put ourselves first, and there is no contradiction.  It is only natural.</p>
<p>PS. Let me add that I wholeheartedly agree with Sam Francis&rsquo; observation that the word &#8220;racist&#8221; is best avoided completely. It was invented and is &#8220;owned&#8221; by the Left. Why use their terminology?  As he said,  &#8220;Anyone who uses the term [racist] to describe himself or his own views has allowed himself to be maneuvered onto his opponents&rsquo; ground and has already lost the debate.  He will need to spend most of his time explaining.&#8221; (And, I might add, not being believed. You cannot wipe out a lifetime of brainwashing with a few sentences.)</p>

		<p> &#8220;If anything, non-Whites will get the message (via all the free lame-stream publicity) that Santa Clarita is NOT a welcoming place for fecund Third World, welfare-dependent non-Whites &mdash;  that it is full of racist, unwelcoming, Third-World hating Whites.<br>
Let&rsquo;s hope Keller sets a precedence for other Whites that are sick and tired of the Third World colonization of their cities.&#8221;<br>

Oh, boy!   Just wait til Obama and Holder latch onto this!   They&rsquo;ll be smacking their lips.  You can expect some vigorous Justice Dept. prosecution and then the Section 8 housing requirements, school busing, redistricting, and all the rest.   No white community can be allowed to stand undiversified. </p>

		<p>Racism is nothing more than a belief that ones race is superior to all others.  </p>
<p>The sum total of racial accomplishments defines which race is indeed superior.  </p>
<p>However, you will never find anyone of any race who doesn&rsquo;t believe that their race is better than the rest.  </p>
<p>Hence virtually everyone is a racist&hellip; </p>

Speaking of terms, I also believe that the word, &ldquo;European-American,&rdquo; especially if &ldquo;African-American&rdquo; sticks for blacks, is the best way of letting people know that we are living in the U.S., yet are proud of all the centuries of Western Civilization that developed in Europe before our ancestors moved to North America.</p>
<p>===&gt;&gt;History of the term &#8220;Hyphenated American&#8221;
<p>The term &#8220;hyphenated American&#8221; was popularized in the 1910s by President Theodore Roosevelt, responding to the increasing fractionalization within the nation along ethnic lines. In an October 12, 1915 speech to the Knights of Columbus, Roosevelt said,</p>
<p>    &#8220;There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism. When I refer to hyphenated Americans, I do not refer to naturalized Americans. Some of the very best Americans I have ever known were naturalized Americans, Americans born abroad. But a hyphenated American is not an American at all. &hellip; The one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin, of preventing all possibility of its continuing to be a nation at all, would be to permit it to become a tangle of squabbling nationalities, an intricate knot of German-Americans, Irish-Americans, English-Americans, French-Americans, Scandinavian-Americans or Italian-Americans, each preserving its separate nationality, each at heart feeling more sympathy with Europeans of that nationality, than with the other citizens of the American Republic. &hellip; There is no such thing as a hyphenated American who is a good American. The only man who is a good American is the man who is an American and nothing else.&#8221;</p>
<p>President Woodrow Wilson also regarded those whom he termed &#8220;hyphenated Americans&#8221; (German-Americans, Irish-Americans, etc.) with suspicion, saying, &#8220;Any man who carries a hyphen about with him carries a dagger that he is ready to plunge into the vitals of this Republic whenever he gets ready.&#8221;</p></p>

		<p>Whether or not he is a &#8220;racist&#8221;, it is great to see a White American finally standing up for his community as a White man, and getting public agreement and support for his so doing!</p>
<p>I suspect that as more Whites are forced into a corner, such labelling (or libelling) will become more common, but we will also start to see more Whites standing up for themselves and each other. I suspect when that happens often enough,our enemies will see that they can no longer intimidate us by calling us &#8220;racists&#8221;, &#8220;fascists&#8221;, &#8220;neonazis&#8221;, and whatnot, they will have to debate us on the issues, and on our terms; egalitarian radicals will be driven from power, and we will finally see some positive  &mdash;  dare I say &#8220;White-positive&#8221;  &mdash;  changes in our society!</p>

<p>I agree completely with owning up right away to the label.  I am one who once thought it productive to actually deny the accusation of &#8220;racist&#8221; and make a grand effort at explaining why the charge, such that it is, was inaccurate.</p>
<p>No more.  I learned that no matter how cogent, how logical my defense, the accuser never changed his mind.  The result?  I&rsquo;m a lot happier.  Now, I&rsquo;m no longer fatigued by the tedium of engaging in the effort of the argument, and what&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s just a lot more liberating: now I simply respond that anyone who wants to call me a racist is free to do so&hellip;, that I live in the real world with my eyes wide open, and only a fool would deny the realities of race&hellip;and now that we both agree I&rsquo;m a racist, what shall we discuss next??</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, too&hellip;say it like you mean it, with a little attitude&hellip;and you might be surprised how many people give up on the debate and just walk away.  I&rsquo;ve enjoyed that reaction myself on more than a few occasions.</p>

		<p>I think the worst mistake a White person can do is try to run away from being labeled a racist.  The term is nothing more than shorthand for &#8220;Shut up, cracker!&#8221; when you are winning an argument with an Anti-White or Non-White.  </p>
<p>I have found that when my response is, &#8220;So what if I am?&#8221; when an Anti-White or Non-White calls me racist has the miraculous effect of shutting THEM up.  It immediately takes the wind out of their sales and deflates their tires like they drove over a bed of nails.</p>
<p>I consider saying &#8220;So what if I am&#8221; shorthand for, &#8220;No, YOU shut up, you stupid moron!&#8221;  Then I refocus on the issue at hand, handily winning the argument.  I don&rsquo;t end up being physically attacked by these people, either.  What can they do?  I didn&rsquo;t deny anything, but I didn&rsquo;t admit anything either.</p>
<p>White people need to snap their fingers at any accusation of racism, refuse to dignify that accusation with a denial or apology and simply soldier on.  Once people test your mettle and realize you won&rsquo;t back down, you will earn their grudging respect.</p>
<p>They are smart enough to KNOW they are race-baiting and race-hustling and what they are doing is wrong.  I think they are a little relieved when a White refuses to be intimidated by the racist label.  The last thing they want is for the lunatics to take over the asylum no matter how much they behave otherwise.</p>

		<p>It is good to see someone stand up for what is right and tell it like it is.  From this day forward, I&rsquo;m going to refer to myself as a Scottish-American. That ought to make for interesting conversation.  I&rsquo;m proud of my Northern European heritage.  </p>
<p>Quoting from the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Bruce McFarland, a political organizer and 32-year resident of the Santa Clarita Valley, called Kellar &#8216;an embarrassment&rsquo; and urged the council to censure him, which elicited boos and expletives from the audience.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
I wish I could have been there.  My &#8220;boos&#8221; and *various expletives deleted* against the imbecilic McFarland would have been the loudest.  What is a &#8220;political organizer&#8221; any way?  Is that something like &#8220;community organizer?&#8221;  They seem to be leftie-speak for rabble rouser.<br>

		<p>The word &#8220;racist&#8221; is an adjective that has no antonym, because the illegitimate word &#8220;racist&#8221; was invented out of thin air in 1933 by Marxist academics as part of their agenda to entice blacks into embracing communism&hellip;</p>

		<p>Yes, if you can&rsquo;t reason with indoctrinated people you can manipulate their brainwashing / programming. It might do to loudly accuse THEM of &#8220;racism&#8221; in loud and inflammatory tones, as they do. Accuse them of &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;hate&#8221;. <br>
Americans need to develop a whole set of techniques to counter the Marxist&rsquo;s Psychological Warfare campaigns. <br>
They could be discussed and practiced in secret group meetings, then broadcast across the internet and in one on one discussions with neighbors, friends and relatives. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Many applauded Kellar when he strode into the meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is what I have always said in the past when commenting on these types of articles: always hold your ground with the baying and drooling multicultural hyenas. Never show any weakness or grovel for their forgiveness, because that is when they go into their filthy feeding frenzies of &ldquo;tolerance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Treat them with the contempt they deserve and you will win almost every time!</p>
