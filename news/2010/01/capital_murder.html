<h1><a href="https://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6826959.html">Capital Murder Charge Filed in Bellville Massacre</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peggy O&rsquo;Hare, Houston Chronicle, January 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A family dispute pushed Maron Thomas to go on a rampage marked by a fury so intense that he decapitated his 2-year-old niece with a machete after killing her and four other family members, Austin County investigators said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Thomas, 20, was charged Wednesday with capital murder in the shooting deaths of his mother, stepfather, sister, brother and his niece. He remains in the Austin County Jail with bail set at $1 million.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The massacre happened between midnight Saturday and 3 a.m. Sunday at the family&rsquo;s home 7 miles outside the Bellville city limits, on FM 1456 between Buckhorn and Cochran.</p>
<p>Thomas then allegedly burglarized a car and was arrested around 3 a.m. after being caught trying to break into a house a mile and a half away while he was naked, investigators said. A neighbor held him at gunpoint until deputies arrived and arrested him on burglary charges. When deputies arrived, he had put on a pair of exercise shorts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thomas&rsquo; sister, Ka&rsquo;Tara Price, 24, of Houston, said she believes anger and Thomas&rsquo; conversion to the Muslim religion influenced his actions. She said she is not aware of him suffering from any mental illness.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While in jail Sunday afternoon on the burglary charges, Maron Thomas admitted to officers that he had killed members of his family, investigators said. As deputies drove to the slain family&rsquo;s home, other relatives called the Austin County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office to report they had found the bodies  &mdash;  about 12 hours after the slayings had occurred.</p>
<p>All killed were found inside the house except for Cedric Thomas, whose nude body was found outdoors in a wooded area behind the residence, Maxwell said. Price said she was told he had been chased there.</p>
<p>Near Cedric Thomas&rsquo; body, investigators found a shotgun and handgun, both believed to have been used in the crime, he said. Investigators aren&rsquo;t yet sure who owns those guns.</p>
<p>The machete used in the decapitation was found inside the residence. The toddler&rsquo;s severed head was found near her body, Faircloth said.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Not aware of his being mentally ill???&#8221;  What a liar.  Nobody goes on a rampage like that without previously exhibiting symptoms.  I&rsquo;d say the man is probably way below average intelligence; he&rsquo;d have to be pretty low to convert to Islam.  And, nobody but an insane, low-IQ savage would decapitate a little girl who wasn&rsquo;t old enough to hurt anybody.  Horsewhipping in the public square is too good for this boy - they need to bring in the caners from Singapore and let them finish him off.  Of course, he&rsquo;ll probably spend the rest of his days in a nice mental institution at public expense, where he&rsquo;ll murder other innocent patients.  However, Texas is real good with the death penalty; let&rsquo;s hope it gets applied here, and soon.</p>

		<p>There was a case earlier in the week of a Muslim who beheaded his wife because she has served him with divorce papers. The woman was found in the TV station that the couple had begun in Buffalo.<br>
The irony is that the mission of the station was to dispel &#8220;negative stereotypes of Muslims&#8221;. You can&rsquo;t make this stuff up!! <br>
Let&rsquo;s add this to the guy in in (Texas?) who took  his two lovely teenage daughters out in the family car and shot them to death because they wanted to assimilate and become American adolescents, you know, terrible things like wanting to wear makeup and liking boys who weren&rsquo;t Muslims.</p>
<p>Savage behavior, hypocrisy, misogyny.  All admirable qualities of the &#8220;Religion of peace&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Blacks are the most violent race on the planet and Islam is the most violent cult in the world.  A black Muslim is a ticking timebomb just waiting to go off&hellip;</p>

		<p>And to think those leftist idiots actually defend this religion! One would think liberal women would at least be outraged by this, seeing how Islam is very misogynistic.</p>

		<p>To DixieProud:</p>
<p>As far as Bantus are concerned, mental illness is akin to demonic possesion. No Bantu  will ever admit to mental illness - it&rsquo;s far easier to blame &#8220;racism&#8221; or poverty, or else shut themselves off completely. They fear acknowledging mental illness among Bantus, because they think that will only reinforce the image of the crazy, out-of-control Bantu man or woman.</p>
<p>Chamique Holdsclaw of the WNBA is a perfect example. She admitted to have &#8220;personal problems&#8221; of an undisclosed nature, and took an entire season off from playing basketball. You know what it was Dixie - Holdsclaw had depression, but she  couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to admit it. For all anyone knew, she might have had chlamydia or some other STD.</p>
<p>How ironic that this guy&rsquo;s sister says &#8220;converting to Islam&#8221; caused his rampage. Doesn&rsquo;t she know she&rsquo;s committing a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; - at least in England, where she&rsquo;d be in the women&rsquo;s can, by now.</p>

		<p>Had this man been a white Christian (preferably some sort of fundamentalist)this story would have saturated the national news for at least a week.</p>
<p>Like all instances of horrific black rampages, it&rsquo;s been willfully ignored by the MSM.</p>

		<p>the guy in in (Texas?) who took his two lovely teenage daughters out in the family car and shot them to death</p>
<p>I understand that he drove them to the airport, shot them to death in the car, got out and went in and boarded a plane for return to Egypt where the &#8220;authorities&#8221; refuse to extradite or arrest him.</p>
<p>And to ANON #3 A black Muslim is a ticking timebomb just waiting to go off&hellip;</p>
<p>I would offer that a black muslim is a ticking time bomb just WANTING to go off.</p>
