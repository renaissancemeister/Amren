<h1><a href="http://www.todaysthv.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=97956&amp;catid=2">John Walker: Arkansas Lottery Discriminates Against Black Students</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Duncan, KTHV-TV (Little Rock), January 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The man who fought Little Rock schools for years in a desegregation lawsuit claims the new Arkansas Lottery discriminates against black students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] would oppose the lottery and it&rsquo;s government proceeds hypocritically given to those who already have,&#8221; Little Rock attorney John Walker said.</p>
<p>Walker says the scholarships soon to be awarded would require an ACT score of at least 19. But he says the average ACT score of black students in Arkansas is only 16.</p>
<p>Walker says, &#8220;So when you set that score, you know the likely number of people who will be able to met that qualification. On the other hand, the average act score of white students is 21. What this means is the state benefits will continue to flow disproportionately to white students to the detriment of black students.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Walker also said black students would not be able to benefit from Advanced Placement courses to boost their grade point, because those classes are full of white students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Statistics from the department of education confirm the average ACT score for Arkansas black students is 16.7.<br>

		<p>The same type of thing happened to me when I was a boy in high School. Only ten people from all four classes were considered for the honor roll and the ten people with the highest overall class average were considered for the honor. Most times, the averages began around 95-96 % and went higher from there. In that my overall class average was always around 75%, I was never considered. It wasn&rsquo;t fair.</p>

		<p>A score of 18 on the ACT is in the 32nd percentile. 16 is the 19th percentile. God forbid we actually ask the students to be able to prove some ability before we shovel some money their way. </p>
<p>Considering the trillions of dollars paid out in the &#8220;War on Poverty&#8221; since 1965 that were supplied by primarily white tax payers, I&rsquo;m not upset that some of that money is coming back. A lot of states run the statistics on where the most lottery tickets are sold and guess what, they tend to be bought by poor people. The only time you see convenience stores in middle class and well to do areas with lines out the door is when the Powerball or Mega Millions is approaching $200 Million. At a few dollars a pop, this is not going to break their bank. </p>
<p>&#8220;Walker also said black students would not be able to benefit from Advanced Placement courses to boost their grade point, because those classes are full of white students.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you had enough black students in a school to fill up AP courses, that principal would sooner run a busload of nuns into a ditch than deny those students their classes. Imagine that the principal of MLK high school in Hornswaggle, AR announcing that he/she has 25 national merit semi-finalists. Every one of these kids had average ACT scores of 26 and received offers from Ivy League schools. Obama himself would be there to congratulate and find out how he did it. This would be in 72 point font on every newspaper and news web site in the US. While this would fulfill the fantasies of every bleeding heart liberal, this is not going to happen. </p>

		<p>This is too funny for words.  The average ACT score for high school students who want to go to college is around 20 to 22.  This average or &#8220;middle&#8221; ACT score would represent a grade of around &#8220;C&#8221;.  A score of 19 would represent a a low &#8220;C&#8221; or high &#8220;D&#8221; grade.  A score of 16 would represent a definite &#8220;D&#8221; grade.  </p>
<p>Hence, they want to give academic scholarships to &#8220;D&#8221; students, who have no business going to college.  In reality, they should only give academic scholarships to exceptional students   &mdash;   i.e., those who score above 32 on the ACT.  </p>

		<p>I see that Mr. Walker doesn&rsquo;t know the difference between &#8220;it&rsquo;s&#8221; and &#8220;its&#8221;.  </p>
<p>I am glad that certain students are weeded out on the college level, where there is no time to babysit them through the day.  If they can&rsquo;t cut it in high school, and are unable to make a good score on the ACT, then perhaps trade school or civil service careers are their answer.  As for putting them in advanced placement courses, that is ridiculous.  The students are in those classes because they already have shown through their excellent grades they deserve to be there; it&rsquo;s not a remedial class used to boost scores on a college placement test.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s this?  All of a sudden blacks do NOT want to be amongst whites?  If this is the case, then why the push for integration?  If this is the case, then why do blacks follow whites to the ends of the Earth and risk their lives just to be with whites?  This statement, by Walker, flies in the face of everything black activists/civil rights advocates have been saying for generations.  Also, Walker&rsquo;s whole approach is a cop out.  Instead of crying &#8220;racism&#8221;, he should be working to improve the average test scores of blacks.  But no.  That would require work and responsibility.</p>

		<p>For the reasons Mr. Walker opposes it, I support it.  That&rsquo;s where you put resources, with smarter students.  If you&rsquo;re inventing something new, you spend more time and money on designs which have promise of working than ones that won&rsquo;t work.  Otherwise, your invention will never come to pass.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t seem to apply that simple logic to education.</p>
<p>BTW, I have mixed feelings about lotteries.  On the one hand, they&rsquo;re a tax on the mathematically handicapped.  (Hint:  Somebody&rsquo;s gonna Lotto, but it&rsquo;s not going to be you.)  On the other hand, with the plutocrats outsourcing our prosperity to Bangalore and Beijing, they&rsquo;re the only real chance the average person has to get rich, even if the odds are exceedingly long.</p>

		<p>I wonder if Mr. Walker would like to come to Indiana and gripe that all of the lottery money towards &#8220;education&#8221; is &#8220;rayciss&#8221; because most of it tends to come from low-income areas. </p>
<p>This is from a TV station in Fort Wayne. The state of Indiana is looking at a bill that will hold back students in the 3rd grade who cannot pass the reading portion of the ISTEP test. There are four districts in Allen County, Indiana and the inner city schools are bringing up the rear. I&rsquo;m sure that his counterparts in Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, and Gary will be screaming bloody murder when Jamal, Devonte, and LaVetta can&rsquo;t matriculate with Madison, Hunter, and Zachary. </p>

		<p>Scholarships are for those who DESERVE them, not for those who simply WANT them.  See, you have to EARN a scholarship - it isn&rsquo;t just free money handed out for nothing.  How is it that the blacks just don&rsquo;t get the idea that they have to ACHIEVE something in order to get a reward????</p>

<p>The only reason I would entertain opposing this bill is that some black students, especially the boys, would have to be held back so often that they would be 15 years old and still in the 3rd grade, in the same classroom as 8-year old white boys and girls.  The boys would be bullied, the girls&hellip;much worse.</p>

		<p>This type of &#8220;thinking&#8221; is beyond idiotic. It actually does away with a basic concept of academic achievement and moves the discussion into the realm of the free handout with a genuinely moronic core argument - a seeming staple of black America&rsquo;s &#8220;fight for equality.&#8221; How Walker can even bring this up without understanding the overt message that blacks are intellectually deficient is a real mystery. Maybe he just likes to hear himself talk no matter how ridiculous the words happen to be.   </p>

		<p>Students who make a 16 on their ACT don&rsquo;t deserve a college scholarship in any way, shape, or form - regardless of their race.  Bluntly put, they don&rsquo;t belong in college in the first place.</p>
<p>A more appropriate reward for scholastic attainment at that level would be a shovel or roofing hammer.  </p>

		<p>Response to #10 Question Diversity</p>
<p>If I were in the state legislature, I would put a provision in the bill that if a child does not pass after one more chance, then he/she would go to a special school where the children are segregated by age. I agree, there would have to be some provision where kids who should be in 9th or 10th grade are not hanging out with 3rd graders. </p>

		<p>to LegalPhD #21, you&rsquo;re absolutely right. But for the past 50 years we&rsquo;ve given them everything for nothing, and they believe they are entitled to what someone else works for. They aren&rsquo;t the least interested in achievement. They just WANT. Blacks play the lottery in much higher numbers than whites, regardless of their [lack of] income.</p>
<p>To grasp the black mentality, I have this example. Several years ago, police were called and arrests were made at a school board meeting here, just outside metro Atlanta. A large number of black mothers were screaming at and storming the Board members because their chirrens weren&rsquo;t going to be allowed to &#8216;walk&rsquo; at graduation - they had failed the 3 attempts they were given to pass the adaquacy senior tests. One mother screamed, &#8220;You&rsquo;re ruining my chirren&rsquo;s LIFE!&#8221;  She was livid that her child wouldn&rsquo;t get her picture taken walking across the stage to get her diploma. Not at all concerned about actually LEARNING anything; just that she wasn&rsquo;t going to get to celebrate.</p>

		<p>If MOST Blacks are truly to convinced they&rsquo;re lifelong victims of discrimination and held down&hellip; despite the mountains of evidence arguing against that belief&hellip; why do they insist on living in this country?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think the rabid anti-White racists like Obama&rsquo;s Jeremiah Wright would have enough brains to pool their resources, relocate as many Blacks to the Mother Continent, as possible. There to blend in with the native population and build a magnificent nation, built and run by Blacks, to show us hated Whites that it can be done. Certainly a far better idea than their lifelong wallowing in that victimhood of theirs.</p>

		<p>Kids with a ACT score below 18 probably would not be able to do any sort of college work to begin with. More than likely they would be more suited to some sort of vocational training but saying that is so unPC these days that even mentioning vocational training is considered racist. Therefore these kids will probably go to college, run up a big bill and then drop out. Either that or they will be steered toward ethnic studies classes where all you have to do is show up to pass and get a worthless degree that qualifies them for some sort of affirmative action qovernment job.</p>
