			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Millbank, Daily Mail (London), January 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A wealthy businessman was arrested at home in front of his wife and young son over an email which council officials deemed &#8216;offensive&rsquo; to gipsies  &mdash;  but which he had not even written.</p>
<p>The email, concerning a planning appeal by a gipsy, included the phrase: &#8216;It&rsquo;s the &#8216;do as you likey&rsquo; attitude that I am against.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Council staff believed the email was offensive because &#8216;likey&rsquo; rhymes with the derogatory term &#8216;pikey&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old IT boss was held in a police cell for four hours until it was established he had nothing to do with the email, which had been sent by one of his then workers, Paul Osmond.</p>
<p>But police had taken his DNA and later confirmed they would be holding it indefinitely.</p>
<p>The businessman, who has asked not to be named, was also fingerprinted in the police investigation estimated to have cost taxpayers up to Â£12,000.</p>
<p>He said two uniformed officers came to his house on a Sunday afternoon and said he would be handcuffed if he did not accompany them to the police station.</p>
<p>His computer and other internet equipment were also seized.</p>
<p>The email, from a computer at his company, was sent last August to a website at Rother District Council, in East Sussex, on which the public can comment on planning applications.</p>
<p>It referred to an appeal by gipsy Linda Smith, who wants to keep a mobile home in an area of outstanding beauty overlooking the Battle of Hastings site.</p>
<p>The email also read: &#8216;Get a job, get planning permission but more to the point get out of the neighbourhood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The businessman, a father of two, said last night: &#8216;I had a sense of total disbelief. My wife and I decided to tell my 11-year-old son I had to go with the police because I had witnessed a road accident.</p>
<p>&#8216;Even though the officers were fairly pleasant to me, I was informed I would be handcuffed if I didn&rsquo;t go voluntarily. They then confiscated my computer and my wife&rsquo;s computer and took them to the police station.</p>
<p>&#8216;I was extremely angry. I was relaxing in the comfort of my home on a Sunday afternoon and then I was in a police car under arrest  &mdash;  all for an innocent comment by a colleague.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was driven five miles to Hastings police station.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;I have never had any criminal record and try my best to teach my children right from wrong. This was a ridiculously heavy-handed police reaction to what they perceived as a racist comment. I am not the least bit racist and neither is Paul Osmond. The gipsy family concerned did not complain.</p>
<p>&#8216;I did nothing wrong yet ended up in a police cell for four hours with my DNA stored on a criminal database.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The arrest happened on November 15 and followed a three-year battle by a gipsy family to win planning permission for the mobile home on land outside the town of Battle.</p>
<p>The planning application concerned this gypsy home in Battle, East Sussex</p>
<p>The planning application concerned this gipsy home in Battle, East Sussex</p>
<p>The family bought a field from a farmer, put down a concrete base, and installed the mobile home at the end of a short driveway. Rother Council issued an enforcement notice against the building.</p>
<p>The businessman said he also objected to the council over the location of the mobile home, which is near his property.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;It seems I have to get planning permission for everything I do right down to dead-heading the daffodils.</p>
<p>&#8216;It seems they can erect this home with impunity. But I made my objections entirely through the proper channels and I have absolutely nothing against anyone in the gipsy community.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The case finally ended last week when Mr Osmond, who had been arrested and bailed, was told there would be no further police action. The planning case is continuing.</p>
<p>Do as You like</p>
<p>Mr Osmond, 39, of Icklesham, said: &#8216;I made it clear to them I am absolutely not racist. I said I was simply registering my objection to this application because it is 200ft from the most important and historical battlefield in the country.</p>
<p>&#8216;I now feel I am not even able to express an opinion for fear of being arrested by the police.</p>
<p>&#8216;One of my closest friends is an Irish traveller and he uses the term &#8216;pikey&rsquo; all the time. This is the ultimate in political correctness going off the scale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sussex Police said they had arrested the businessman over &#8216;suspicion of committing a racial or religious-aggravated offence&rsquo;.</p>
<p>After consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, it was decided to take no further action against Mr Osmond.</p>
<p>Chief Inspector Heather Keating said: &#8216;Sussex Police have a legal duty to promote community cohesion and tackle unlawful discrimination.</p>
<p>&#8216;We are satisfied we acted appropriately in identifying the owner of the computer used and through this, the identity of the writer of the offending line.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Police said they would hold the innocent men&rsquo;s DNA indefinitely, which they said was in line with national policy.</p>
<p>A council spokesman said: &#8216;As far as we were concerned it was an offensive comment, so we got in touch with the police.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>This is insane.  I don&rsquo;t know what &#8220;pikey&#8221; means but that&rsquo;s beside the point, how can you arrest someone for an opinion or an offensive comment? I mean people have the right to their opinions and likes and dislikes, these are not criminal offences. </p>

		<p>The fabled growling English bulldog has morphed into a shivering mute Chihuahua.  The England that Orwell depicted in his book 1984 was a bastion of freedom compared to the England of today.  No one deserves to lose their liberty more than those who refuse to defend it&hellip;</p>

		<p>And do you know why the police are acting in this way? It&rsquo;s all to do with an organisation called Common Purpose - ostensibly an &#8220;educational charity&#8221; - who headhunt (yes, you read that right) actual or prospective leaders in key public positions (the judiciary, local and national government, the education system, the civil service, the NHS, the print and broadcast media, the police, etc), subject the &#8220;successful&#8221; candidates to a Common Purpose &#8220;training&#8221; course (for which they charge the attendees, their employers or, more often, the taxpayer, a large fee), and then re-insert them into their place of work on the firm understanding that their primary loyalty is to Common Purpose, and that they are to &#8220;lead beyond authority&#8221;. Such Common Purpose &#8220;graduates&#8221; (in all of the key professions listed and others) regularly meet in secret under the Chatham House Rule.</p>

<p>BOY, you can prosecute anybody for anything if that is your duty.<br>
Community cohesion&hellip;.wow, is that in the Magna Carta, Ten Commandments or something? Does Ms Keatings oath go something like I will enforce Community Cohesion or enforce the written law of the land? <br>
If I have an argument with my neighbor which one of us is arrested for not agreeing (being cohesive)with the other.Does he have to agree with me or do I have to agree with him?<br>
I guess we have to agree with the Police Inspector Keating on everything or be arrested.<br>
Of course she would say I have my rights and can disagree, (as long as it was not on anything important).  </p>

		<p>Arrested for using the word &#8216;pikey&rsquo; yet on this side of pond the word &#8216;redneck&rsquo;, a racial slur, is used in order to show to everyone else how enlightened you are. </p>
<p>They certainly use the word &#8216;racist&rsquo;, &#8216;hate&rsquo; etc over and over too. Since only whites can be racist for all intents and purposes, I suppose it&rsquo;s Ok to use the pejorative (sarcasm off).</p>

<p><br>
Well said. It&rsquo;s pathetic to see accused and abused Whites crying and moaning that they &#8220;aren&rsquo;t in any way RACIST and how they consider Racist thoughts to be THE WORST, most evil thing in the world&#8221;.</p>
<p>The best defense is a good offense. Never cry and whine that you aren&rsquo;t racist. It is not a crime to think politically incorrect thoughts or to take the side of our White people. Racial loyalty to our people is a good thing. When you see a White person starting to give in and cry and moan and blather that &#8220;he isn&rsquo;t racist&#8221; - intervene and force the individual to toughen up for the sake of our people.</p>
<p>Keep a stiff upper lip and also start to put out the truth that in this day and age, the good people are ones who &#8220;HAVE BEEN ARRESTED&#8221;, who have been persecuted. </p>
<p>We have to get away from producing and promoting cowardly sissies who never get arrested, who never cause any trouble.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s long past time that we started to cause a lot of trouble.</p>

		<p>For years in my own way &hellip; to the humor and (often bad humor of detractrers) I have been challenging individuals I&rsquo;d meet haphazardly to think&hellip;..as individuals&hellip; To just take any controversial subject&hellip; and try to figure it out for themselves&hellip; over time&hellip;constantly perfecting a solution or opinion they thought best given all criteria/info they could acrue. In this way I feel people can learn about themselves and about the world&hellip; and maybe more important&hellip;become their true or actuated SELF. This nation was built on an interesting mix of solid genetics solid brains solid ideas&hellip;. and the open market of competition of ideas backed by men willing to kill or be killed for the ideas they believed indespensible for a life worth living*  I have encouraged individual thought because I believe without it&hellip;.Individuality is stillborn and forfeited. The world it seems to me ..when I see whats happening in England is going contrary to individuality.. as  if a new inqusition has been slowly tightening a noose around free thinkers necks&hellip; orchestrated by a new religion called political correctness/multicultism&hellip;.which is basically&hellip; another (Rule of the proletariot). Again I believe the only viril antidote is a counterthrust of strong individual pursuits of truth with the willingness to defend them at any cost* We have to ask ourselves&hellip; are these laws which are sculpting our percpectives/fates&hellip;.Just?</p>

<p>Britain may have won the war (with an enormous amount of help from the USSR and the USA), but it sure didn&rsquo;t win the peace. I can&rsquo;t think of one single thing Britain ever gained from its foolish anti-German policies. In my opinion the German people today are better off then the British (particularly the English) in every possible way. Tragic and stupid.</p>

		<p>At this time I can think of no better Englishman to quote than George Orwell, in his BBC wartimne radio essay &#8220;Wells, Hitler and the World State&#8221;: &#8220;&hellip;.At this time I can think of no better Englishman to quote than George Orwell: &#8220;&hellip;. What has kept England on its feet during the past <br>
year? In part, no doubt, some vague idea about a better future, but <br>
chiefly the atavistic emotion of patriotism, the ingrained feeling of <br>
the English-speaking peoples that they are superior to foreigners. For <br>
the last twenty years the main object of English left-wing intellectuals <br>
has been to break this feeling down, and if they had succeeded, we might <br>
be watching the SS men patrolling the London streets at this moment. <br>
Similarly, why are the Russians fighting like tigers against the German <br>
invasion? In part, perhaps, for some half-remembered ideal of Utopian <br>
Socialism, but chiefly in defence of Holy Russia (the &#8220;sacred soil of <br>
the Fatherland&#8221;, etc etc), which Stalin has revived in an only slightly <br>
altered form. The energy that actually shapes the world springs from <br>
emotions  &mdash;  racial pride, leader-worship, religious belief, love of <br>
war  &mdash;  which liberal intellectuals mechanically write off as anachronisms, <br>
and which they have usually destroyed so completely in themselves as to <br>
have lost all power of action&hellip;.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The truth is  that they havent the actual power to prosecute for  these ambiguous remarks, however, the inconvenience would be quite enough to  force any one into self censorship. The day it ever happens to me I will demand to be charged and will see it through to the end. And so should we all. That&rsquo;s the only way you will ever turn the tables. Britain&rsquo;s press  has cases like these coming up every other week, and rarely does it result in prosecution. Simply because the cost  and negative publicity would rebound on them. Even the few fair minded liberals still about  tend to disagree with this  clumsy handed approach.  </p>
