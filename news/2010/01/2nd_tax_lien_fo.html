			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henry K. Lee, San Francisco Chronicle, January 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums and his wife, who already have a lien on their property for failing to pay more than $239,000 in taxes to the Internal Revenue Service, are now facing a second lien for more than $13,000, records show.</p>
<p>Dellums, 73, and his wife, Cynthia, 55, who acts as his unpaid adviser, are named in an IRS lien filed with the Alameda County recorder&rsquo;s office Dec. 23 in the amount of $13,638.</p>
<p>The lien, which says it is for tax year 2008, comes two months after the couple were slapped with a lien in Alameda County for failing to pay $239,000 in taxes from 2005 to 2007, the year Dellums took office as mayor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A lien naming Ron Dellums was also filed in October in Washington, D.C., where he lived for more than 30 years as a member of Congress and later a lobbyist. Both the mayor and his wife are also named in two additional liens in Washington, D.C., filed in November and December, records show.</p>
<p>The Dellumses own a house in Washington, which was assessed at $1.4 million in 2007, public records show. {snip}</p>

		<p>SKIP the psychic predicts&hellip;&hellip;..absolutely nothing will come of this because he is black. The IRS threatened MY first born over $6000, forced me to pay most up front and monthly payments for the rest&hellip;but then, I&rsquo;m a white, taxpaying male helping to row the Titanic (the U.S.) into the iceberg.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s remarkable how many black politicians, who have all sorts of plans for spending the tax dollars that are paid mostly by white people, don&rsquo;t think they should have to pay taxes themselves.</p>

		<p>Incompetent and corrupt. That&rsquo;s black rule in a nutshell. </p>
<p>Funny the father of the U.S. anti-apartheid movement would embody these two traits so perfectly. </p>
<p>Among folks in Oakland I know there&rsquo;s a kind of Stockholm Syndrome, a surprising lack of real outrage that their mayor   &mdash;    a man who has pushed for higher taxes and brow beat them about social causes for decades as their Congressman   &mdash;   isn&rsquo;t paying his freakin&rsquo; taxes. </p>
<p>Hence the lure   &mdash;   for me   &mdash;   of sites like this. Sweet, sweet politically incorrect nectar. </p>

		<p>Although he owns that $1.4 million house in Georgetown, Dellums is known to stay at the Four Seasons and the Ritz Carlton during his frequent visits to D.C. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called &#8220;living large,&#8221; and I believe that blacks generally approve of it among their own kind because it represents getting back at the white system that has supposedly abused them. </p>

		<p>You will also notice that black politicians also give almost nothing to charity. They feel they have already spent enough of the taxpayers&rsquo; money on the undeserving to get a free pass with regards to obligations to their fellow man.</p>
