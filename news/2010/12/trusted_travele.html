<h1>Trusted Traveler Program Lets Mexicans Skip Airport Security</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Judicial Watch, Dec. 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As violent drug cartels take over Mexico and expand their criminal enterprises north, the United States has signed a &#8220;trusted traveler&#8221; agreement that allows pre-screened Mexican airline passengers to bypass lengthy airport security checkpoints. </p>
<p>The foreigners will get &#8220;trusted traveler cards&#8221; with fingerprints and other biometric data and they must answer customs declarations questions on touch-screen kiosks before leaving airport inspection areas. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano claims it&rsquo;s a way to enhance information sharing and mutual security in the face of &#8220;ever-evolving, multinational threats.&#8221;</p>
<p>About 84 million Mexicans are expected to qualify for the trusted traveler program, according to Mexico&rsquo;s Interior Ministry Secretary, who signed the agreement on behalf of his country this week. Celebrating the festive occasion, the Mexican government official assured that the new accord will facilitate the U.S. entry of business travelers and tourists who are key factors in economic development, growth of trade and cultural exchange. </p>
<p>Mexicans will get the perk through the U.S. government&rsquo;s Global Entry Program, which allows participants to obtain security clearance by presenting a &#8220;machine-readable&#8221; passport or resident card at airport &#8220;Global Entry kiosks.&#8221; The machines issue the foreign travelers a transaction receipt and directions to baggage claim and the exit into the United States. Applying is easy. Candidates fill out an online application, provide valid identification and answer a few questions from a Customs and Border Protection officer.</p>
<p>While Napolitano was in Mexico finalizing the trusted traveler agreement this week, she also took the opportunity to sign a &#8220;letter of intent&#8221; to develop a plan for protecting immigrants from criminal attacks as they cross the border  &mdash;  illegally  &mdash;  into the U.S. Mexican officials have long complained that American law enforcement officers stand by as illegal immigrants are robbed, killed or violently beaten. Napolitano has committed to reducing the risk to life and security of migrants, according to the Mexican minister.</p>

		<p>Coming soon.  You to can avoid the virtual strip search and mandatory groping of your genitals by criminals (many past criminals work for the TSA) when you travel.  All you have to do is agree to be fingerprinted and be the first to accept a national ID.  Soon, you will have the added convenience of having that chip planted in your skull.</p>
<p>No, not conspiracy theory nonsense&hellip;.but actually happening right now, right before your eyes.</p>
<p>Now, you know what the purpose of those body scanners and enhanced frisking was.  You also know that it is obviously not necessary since nobody coming into the country seems to need to undergo that.</p>

		<p>In San Diego they have the &#8220;fastway&#8221; program where prescreened people are able to cross the border without the checks and wait,needless to say a lot of drug smugglers have been caught using this program.</p>

		<p>Eighty-four million might qualify? While Americans are increasingly subjected to dictatorial police state treatment as if they are all criminals? Who is this government working for, anyway? Napolitano and the entire cohort need to be shown the exit door, the sooner the better. The government has apparently been increasing methods of spying and ways to physically control the population. I wonder if they&rsquo;re expecting something to happen further on down the road. </p>

		<p>There are millions of people who can drive to their destinations rather than fly.  It&rsquo;s mystery to me why the millions who complain about groping don&rsquo;t forego flying to send a signal that we want nothing to do with the feds infringements upon our rights by refusing to profile Muslims.  The economic hit to the economy and federal revenue would be staggering.</p>
<p>Personally, there&rsquo;s no way I would subject myself to the abuse of these out-of-control thugs.</p>

		<p>Very interesting.  I travel internationally quite frequently.  I visit U.S. Embassies and Consulates overseas, and yet I have never heard of this trusted traveler program.  I guess that if you are a white person they don&rsquo;t feel they need to inform you about it, but I bet that every semi-literate Mexican knows all about it.<br>
Just go to the following U.S. Government address and you too can apply, even if you are a white American.<br>

I just discovered this on the internet a moment ago, so please let me know if they give while folks the runaround, or otherwise make it obvious that they really only want Mexicans to know about it.</p>

<p>No, this only applies to Mexicans and Spanish speaking Arab terrorist that cross from Mexico who want to skip airport security. The rest of us don&rsquo;t get that option.</p>
<p>&#8220;she also took the opportunity to sign a &ldquo;letter of intent&rdquo; to develop a plan for protecting immigrants from criminal attacks as they cross the border &mdash; illegally &mdash; &#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of protecting the border, the border patrol will be responsible for protecting not only the illegals, but also protecting drug gangs coming across from rival drug gangs and other U.S. law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>Exactly.  As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, no one has any &#8220;right&#8221; at all to fly on an airplane as opposed to any other form of transportation.  Put the damned airlines in charge of security  &mdash;  and let them choose which passengers can fly, as should be their right as a legitimate business.  Market forces will conspire to keep would be terrorists off the planes.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m being overly simplistic, but no one has an inherent right to fly on a plane, and anonymous above has an excellent point.  No one has an inherent right to fly into the US, either  &mdash;  simply tell other countries that unless they improve security, none of their citizens can fly into the US.  Let the satanic muzzies be the ones putting the satanic chip implants into their skulls.</p>

		<p>Where&rsquo;s MY &#8220;Trusted Traveller Card&#8221;? I&rsquo;m an American citizen, never had so much as a parking ticket in 67 years. I learned in school that as such I was presumed innocent of any crime (including being a terrorist) until proven guilty&hellip;Oh wait, that only counts if I&rsquo;m a Mexican or a Muslim&hellip;more fool me, I was born White, English-speaking American&hellip;I have no rights other than to travel another way or be sexually assualted at the local airport.</p>

		<p>Really, this is simply one more sign that the US government sees its own citizens as a populace to be controlled, much in the way it controls (or tries to control) the people of Iraq and Afghanistan.  Though I will note, at least in those places the locals tend to push back. The real problem, of course, is why do the majority of Americans go along with being treated as if they are an subjugated populace? </p>
<p>One more chapter in the history of anarcho-tyranny. </p>

		<p>  Another example of how &#8220;our&#8221; government distrusts its own citizens, but considers Third World flyers from failed states &#8220;trusted travelers.&#8221;</p>

  <br>
  Which is &#8220;our&#8221; government more concerned with: the safety of Americans from Narco-Terrorist Mexican drug cartels or the protection of mestizo law breakers in the country illegally? You decide. </p>

		<p>It sure would be nice if Americans had a government that looked after their interests the way Mexicans have. And to clarify, I&rsquo;m not referring to the Mexican government looking after Mexican interests but the US government looking after Mexican interests. Yeah, it&rsquo;s actually reached the point that foreigners have more rights in our country than we do.</p>
