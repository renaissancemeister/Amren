			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cameron Smith, Yahoo! Sports, December 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A youth football coach in Georgia has jeopardized his future, and that of the youth football association in which he works, with a series of racist ramblings on Facebook, with his comments inciting fury among parents of athletes in his league, which boasts a minority enrollment of 50 percent.</p>
<p>According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Frank Samuelson, the coach of a team of 10-year-olds in the Brookwood (Ga.) Football Association, enraged parents of the players on his team with a series of posts in October where he referred to those of South Asian descent as &#8220;red dots&#8221; and Hispanic-Americans as &#8220;Beaners,&#8221; while also attacking women and other minorities. </p>
<p>Among others, the Journal-Constitution cited the following two Facebook comments as two that incited the fury of Samuelson&rsquo;s football parents: </p>
<p>&#8220;I was dining in an Asian buffet today [big surpise], and I heard this morning how Asian students are suppodely so much smarter than American kids. My personal observation is that those fishheads still eat with chopsticks. It took Western ingenuity to invent the fork. I&rsquo;m just saying. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they a&rsquo;int that friggin&rsquo; smart.&#8221; [ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ]</p>
<p>&#8220;How to solve illegal immigration: Arrest the 30+ million illegals that are here first. Have them build a huge brick wall across the border [those guys do great brick work], and make them build it from the Mexican side of the border. Mount 50 calibre machine guns across the top and shoot anyone trying to climb over.&#8221;</p>
<p>The coach  &mdash;  who also served as vice president of the Brookwood Football Association  &mdash;  claimed that the comments were not intended for public consumption and referred to them as private jokes between him and friends, a defense which was good enough for BFA leadership to defend his role and keep him among the group&rsquo;s leadership core. </p>
<p>That, in turn, has led to public backlash, with parents threatening to pull their children out of the league altogether. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} While 68 percent of the students in Brookwood schools were white in 2005, the past five years have seen the area&rsquo;s population become much more diverse, with only 48 percent of white decent and 32 percent of students now black or Hispanic. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>If the comments were NOT made in front of children or in some sort of professional context I dont see what the problem is. Facebook and other networking sites are very public and unless you set your privacy settings pretty high it is likely that people you dont have on a friends list will see what you have written. </p>

<p>And that is the right way to handle it!  Who cares if parents want to pull their kids out of the team?  He said it in a private conversation and they should focus on his coaching; not his personal, social, and political views.  </p>

		<p>And that new percentage/ratio is right about where the tipping point is - where a school, community, or team becomes unruly, ill mannered, inattentive, rebellious, and just plain trouble.  Hence his frustration and concern.  The worrisome thing is, freedom of speech in this country is a thing of the past.  No one is allowed to have any speech or thought - even privately - that counters the PC mandated mantra.  The blacks used mass civil disobedience against Whites, why can&rsquo;t WE do the same in return?  If all we whites stood our ground, spoke as one, and said whatever the Bill of Rights guaranteed us we could say, what would they do?  Fire us all?  Bring about the United States of Zimbabwe into being overnight?  The politicians, civil servants, professors, et al would be out of a job in a month - for WE WHITES are the ONLY ones paying taxes as a whole.<br/>

		<p>We Whites are not allowed to tell a joke unless our Masters approve.  There&rsquo;s a White comedian named Brad Stine who was fired from a comedy job because he told a joke about forks being better than chopsticks.  A couple of Asians complained, and that was that&hellip;he was fired.  </p>
<p>I often wonder if comedians like Sam Kiniston, for instance, would ever be allowed to work today.</p>

<p>Wow! how&rsquo;s that for impartiality in reporting? The coach has &#8220;jeopardized his future&#8221; with a &#8220;series of racist ramblings.&#8221; Not jokes, not observations, but flat out &#8220;racist ramblings.&#8221; </p>
<p>Never mind the fact that you could talk to a Black Panther and a white politician and they would both give a vastly different definition of the word &#8220;racist.&#8221; And yet  this reporter knows! </p>
<p>And how about the racist slur at the end there: &#8220;the past five years have seen the area&rsquo;s population become much more diverse&#8221; &#8220;Diverse,&#8221; of course, applying not to hair color or interests or background or area of study or nation of ones ancestors or religion, but solely to skin color! Talk about racist.</p>
<p>What is the claimed rationale for parents pulling their kids out of the coach&rsquo;s team? That he won&rsquo;t treat the kids fairly but will be influenced by their skin color? Well, if they had no inkling of unfair treatment on the coach&rsquo;s part before now, that pretty much proves that he does treat the kids fairly. It has nothing to do with what he posted on Facebook. What they&rsquo;re really against is freedom of speech.</p>

		<p>While I have no problem with the coach&rsquo;s comments, I question the coach&rsquo;s mental capacity. He is a white man living in the U.S.; he should know the consequences of making such blatantly Incorrect statements, and avoid making them. This is similar to driving a truck with a 9&rsquo; height through a tunnel with an 8&rsquo;6&#8221; clearance.</p>

There&rsquo;s a 1993 movie called Falling Down:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_Down" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_Down</a></p>
<p>The white guy goes nuts dealing with his multicultural hell.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen the movie so I don&rsquo;t know what subtle message is may be espousing (white men are dangerous racists?). It might also be that the screenwriter couldn&rsquo;t stand what LA had become and was writing his deepest fantasies. Either way, it was made in 1993 and I believe it may portray the white man fighting for his survival.</p>
<p>Like the screenwriter, Coach Samuelson was likely expressing his increasing anger and frustration at a changing reality that will destroy America as we knew it.<br/>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get that message and I love that movie.  He was nice to the black people on the movie (the black guy protesting outside a bank and the black man and his son in the burger joint), he killed a nazi storeowner, and only fought those hispanics because they pulled a weapon on them.  He was willing to walk away from them.  I think it was just a movie showing a regular guy getting fed up with the slime of LA and I don&rsquo;t feel it made one race look better than another.  This is coming from a guy who sees Hollywood as anti-white and anti-conservative at just about every turn, too</p>

		<p>There it is again: &#8221; attacking women and other minorities &#8220;.  This exposes the true nature of the anti-white campaign. </p>
<p>If we could just separate male mosquitos from female mosquitos, we could be done with all mosquitos for all time, because they would become extinct.  </p>
<p>In the same way, anti-whites laying claim to white women is part of the program of genocide against whites.  </p>
