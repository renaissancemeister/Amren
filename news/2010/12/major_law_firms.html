<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-law-firm-20101226,0,7760657.story">Major Law Firms Hire Fewer Women and Minorities</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carol J. Williams, Los Angeles Times, December 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The nation&rsquo;s biggest law firms had been making impressive strides in hiring women, people of color and those with disabilities  &mdash;  until the recession dried up legal spending and wiped out more than 5,800 lawyers&rsquo; jobs.</p>
<p>After two years of layoffs and hiring deferrals, the proportions of women and minorities at major law firms dropped in 2010 for the first time since industry analysts began collecting demographic hiring data in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The statistical setbacks have been marginal  &mdash;  less than one percentage point in each group  &mdash;  but they concern affirmative action advocates and law firm recruiters who fear long-term damage to the quest for lawyers who reflect the clientele and communities they serve.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think that layoffs or reductions in force were done in a race-conscious way or a biased way. {snip},&#8221; said James Leipold, executive director of the Washington-based association [the National Assn. for Law Placement].</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Leipold said he expects to see the consequences of the diversity setbacks in seven years or so, when firms are reviewing candidates for partnership and will be seeing fewer minorities and women in the pool of contenders.</p>
<p>Association figures showing slight drops in women and minority representation mirrored the results of other recent studies by the American Lawyer magazine, the Minority Corporate Counsel Assn. and the American Bar Assn.&rsquo;s Commission on Women in the Profession.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hispanics, the country&rsquo;s fastest-growing minority group, already make up more than 15% of the U.S. population, but less than 5% of all lawyers are Hispanic. That&rsquo;s a big disparity,&#8221; said Stephen N. Zack, American Bar Association president.</p>
<p>{snip} The advancement statistics for racial minorities are even more dire, with people of color accounting for only about 6% of those sharing in their firm&rsquo;s profits. Minority women are 2% of partners nationwide, consistently the most under-represented demographic, according to the studies.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve known a lot of women in law school and found them quite capable, but they, like a lot of men, aren&rsquo;t ready to sacrifice  their lives and their children working for a major firm.  They don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth it (and neither do I honestly).</p>
<p>For blacks however, in economic downturns firms can&rsquo;t handle the incompetence.  Everyone has to be able to pull their weight.</p>

		<p>It is worth looking into how many white men are being hired by minority and women owned law firms or any other type of business for that matter.  My guess is that it isn&rsquo;t a lot.   </p>

<p>And the Hispanic lawyers in practice scored at the bottom on the LSAT. But you better keep a few around your law firm as associates just in case you draw an affirmative action judge like Sonia Sotomayor, who&rsquo;s incapable of following the recipe for chalupas in the Joy of Cooking, but will always manage to patch together some cut-and-paste judgment in favor of a fellow tribal member.</p>

<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s because the big law firms, say, like the ones covered in this very article, maybe because they are scarfing them up (at the unstated expense of white heterosexual males who are being discriminated) to bring in &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a bit similar to colleges wringing their hands about a lack of non-whites while there are numerous special school just for them. Or the way rural areas lament a lack of minorities at the same time suburban government offices and private companies are heavily recruiting for them, and some cities area are nearly 100% minority (and doing more to engender diversity too).</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t very well have programs doing everything you can to being in people of color at big law firms, and then complain about their absence somewhere else. Well, if you&rsquo;re a leftist you can. </p>

<p>For quite some time I&rsquo;ve seen posts on this site warning that as the economy continues to deteriorate we will see more and more private firms reducing their AA work forces, because they can no longer pay money out for the sake of political correctness as they have in the past.</p>
<p>The situation will get far worse, and we will definitely see the Sotomayor types fall by the wayside due to incompetence, and their employers&rsquo; reluctance to waste their firm&rsquo;s dwindling revenue will eventually evolve into a necessity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my opinion that the continuing economic deterioration will eventually be the death knell of political correctness, since it is ALL based on giving non-whites freebies that can no longer be afforded.</p>

		<p>Yes indeed. It sure is such a shame when your race has to rely on another race to hire you. </p>
<p>I guess women and minorities still haven&rsquo;t grasped the concept of starting their own law firms.</p>

<p>Except in most prominent firms, the only people who get to share in the firm&rsquo;s profits are the senior partners, and you don&rsquo;t get to be a senior partner unless you demonstrate ability to win judgments yielding big legal fees, OR you&rsquo;re a prominent ex-politician hired as a rainmaker.  Staff attorneys, which most AA hires in such firms are, only get the satisfaction of a regular salary, not having to eke out an existence chasing ambulances making less money than the USPS letter carrier delivering mail to your sardine box apartment, though it comes at the expense of a 20-hour a day workload doing the &#8220;heavy lifting,&#8221; and that&rsquo;s sometimes literally true   &mdash;   Law books do tend to the heavy side!</p>

		<p> I&rsquo;m not so sure that the number of AA hires will decrease dramatically should the economy swoon; firms still need to get clients and win over diverse juries.</p>

		<p>The situation is dire, no doubt, but not quite as desperate as they make it out to be. 15% of the nation may be Hispanic, however, there&rsquo;s a good chance the bulk of that population is under the age of 25, and therefore unlikely to be even capable of being a lawyer, unless they are all smarter than Doogie Howser.</p>

<p>Nonsense.  Big silk stocking law firms do not, by and large,  serve &#8220;communities of color.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Be careful what you wish for&hellip;</p>
<p>If a JAG Lawyer has to sit in on a Predator firing of a Hellfire missile into a crowd at a wedding to nail a &#8216;terrorist&rsquo; in the Swat valley, then they can also be mandated on the medical review board which decides whether you are &#8216;worthy enough&rsquo; for an operation to keep you healthy.</p>
<p>And they can similarly sit in on flying courts to give &#8216;legal weight&rsquo; in all manner of Judicio In Extremis conditions of civil law breakdown.  Do you honestly think that an ethnic or gender biased: &#8216;for the victim, which is me&rsquo;, lawyer could be trusted if the issue comes down to making a racially stable ruling?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&#8216;Judex Aequitatem Semper Spectari Debet&rsquo; quickly becomes a counterproductive condition in civil war where stabilizing barriers and lines of demarcation are essential to keeping anarchy from becoming entropic.  And people will not vest their loyalty in something too like the condition that is failing now.  Conservatism on racial grounds will rule.</p>
