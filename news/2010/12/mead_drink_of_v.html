<h1><a href="https://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MEAD_RENAISSANCE?SITE=FLTAM&amp;SECTION=US">Mead, Drink of Vikings, Comes out of the Dark Ages </a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Allen G. Breed, Tampa Bay Online, December 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mead, that drink of viking saga and medieval verse, is making a comeback. But this ain&rsquo;t your ancestors&rsquo; honey wine.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not just for the Renaissance fair anymore,&#8221; says Becky Starr, co-owner of Starrlight Mead, which recently opened in an old woven label mill in this little North Carolina town.</p>
<p>In fact, this most ancient of alcoholic libations hasn&rsquo;t been this hot since Beowulf slew Grendel&rsquo;s dam and Geoffrey Chaucer fell in with the Canterbury pilgrims at the Tabard.</p>
<p>In the past decade, the number of &#8220;meaderies&#8221; in the United States has tripled to around 150, says Vicky Rowe, owner of Gotmead.com, which describes itself as &#8220;the Internet&rsquo;s premier resource for everything to do with mead.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Traditional mead is made with three ingredients  &mdash;  honey, water and yeast. The biggest hurdle has been overcoming that centuries-old misconception that something made from honey HAS to be sweet.</p>
<p>But, as Rowe is quick to point out, grapes can be pretty sweet, too.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The honey, water and yeast are just the base. There are fruit-flavored meads, called melomels. There are methyglyns made with herbs and spices. And then there are what Rowe calls &#8220;weirdomels, which is mead made with lots of other things.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are even veggie meads.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a beet mead that was screaming pink, like, fluorescent pink, and actually was quite tasty,&#8221; says Rowe. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve had mead made with nuts, with exotic honeys you&rsquo;ve never heard of. You know, pretty much anything you can throw into a liquid and ferment.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Until about 1500, mead was THE alcoholic beverage of choice, Rowe says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because cultivated grapes were only for the rich, and at that point in time the poor folks, they couldn&rsquo;t get it,&#8221; says Rowe, who earned the nickname &#8220;Mead Wench&#8221; after years of wandering Renaissance fairs laden with wineskins full of her own homemade meads. &#8220;They had thin beer that they could make at home or they had mead, because honey was readily available to anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>In &#8220;Beowulf,&#8221; the Old English epic heroic poem, the great mead-hall Heorot is the scene of most of the action. It is where King Hrothgar &#8220;with fair courtesy quaffed many a bowl of mead,&#8221; and where the &#8220;fell monster&#8221; Grendel slaughtered 30 thanes passed out &#8220;after the drinking of the mead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chaucer&rsquo;s 14th-century &#8220;Canterbury Tales&#8221; contain several references to mead or &#8220;methe.&#8221; But with the opening of the New World and its sugar plantations, Rowe says, &#8220;mead began a slow decline .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and by the 1700s was almost nonexistent.&#8221;</p>
<p>That began to change in the 1960s, when the hippie culture rediscovered the joys of mead. Then, with the spread of Renaissance fairs and re-enactment groups like the Society for Creative Anachronism, and the growth of the craft beer industry, this musty old drink was suddenly seen as a &#8220;new and interesting and potentially wonderful thing,&#8221; says Rowe.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Picking up where Chaucer left off, J.K. Rowling has introduced a whole new generation of readers to the honey wine. {snip}</p>
<p><br>
Wine and beer makers are aiming for a slightly older demographic.</p>

I only knew mead by it&rsquo;s name and assumed, wrongly, that it was a kind of beer or ale. From the effects described in Beowulf, I thought one sip would knock me to the ground and was eager to try it; it sounded like THE man&rsquo;s-man drink. </p>
<p>I finally had my chance. I had my one and only taste at a renaissance festival in NY. It was sweet and relatively dense as I remember. I would sip it as a novelty with friends but it&rsquo;s not something I would drink very much.</p>
<p>If my drinking it will help fuel a renaissance of mead, I could support the cause though in small amounts.</p>

		<p>The alternative culture has some good things going for it: A desire for small, earth-bound communities; a connection to the earth and hard but satisfying labor thereon, an appreciation of the arts-and-crafts movement,  and now: Mead.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to taste it, possibly releasing some sort of inner Viking.</p>
<p>Conservatives talk of being conservative, but what are they conserving? Only money-making and free markets.</p>
<p>Their hands are too soft to even touch a Viking battle-axe.</p>
<p>That is not real conservatism.  </p>

		<p>One afternoon in the spring of 1971 I stopped at the tasting room of a small winery right next to Interstate 101 in Solvang, CA where I got my first taste of mead. I took a bottle of one of the sweeter varieties with me when I left and I have seldom been without one since that day. May this historic drink of our people warm and embolden us for all our days. </p>

		<p>I made mead for about 15 years, up to about 20 years ago (some of that time, yes, in the SCA.)</p>
<p>Grape juice is sweet, but wine can be made &#8216;dry&rsquo; (little to no residual sugars - everything gets fermented into alcohol.) I used to use 12.5 lbm honey per 5 gal water, then rack 1 week, 3 weeks after, then 3 months after, then age 2 - 4 years with oak splints in glass carboys.</p>
<p>Unlike frothy, cloudy, beer-type meads at ren-faires, these end products were fully aged in a year-round cool, dark wine cellar to produce clear, dry, meads. Lightly sparking sometimes, they were a joy to drink. The delicate essences of the flowers behind the honey drove the flavor, such as clover, orange blossom, or buckwheat.</p>
<p>Except if a batch were to have been forgotten and discovered later, I bet none of the Vikings or Celts had the patience to make it the way I did!</p>

		<p>Mead is easy to make at home (or in a dorm room). Google &#8220;brewing mead at home&#8221; and you&rsquo;ll find lots of info. Valhalla features lots of mead, so you better get used to it :)</p>

		<p>bees are dying en masse,   Honey, extended with invert sugar is routed into the country from China,the average consumer can&rsquo;t tell the difference anyway,  and they want to push mead. Excuse me while I play Tom T.Hall &#8220;I love beer&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Mead was drunk in all Slavic cultures and must be of Sarmatian origin bc &#8216;med&rsquo; means &#8216;honey&rsquo; (key ingredient in mead) in Slavic languages, being the root of &#8216;medved&rsquo; which means &#8216;bear&rsquo; to with &#8216;ved&rsquo; meaning &#8216;lead&rsquo; - so the word for &#8216;bear&rsquo; translates to &#8216;honey leader&rsquo; or &#8216;leader to honey&rsquo;. Sarmatians (ancestors of King Arthur, pre-Slavic Serbs &amp; Croats and even the Rus&rsquo; Vikings in their pre-Germanic/Slavic stage of ethnogenesis) are the only people that can account for the etymology of &#8216;mead&rsquo;</p>

		<p>There are three main varieties of Mead around today.  The commercial stuff, which is mostly imported from Poland, is simply a cheap raisin wine flavored with honey.  English Meads may be the same mix, or real Meads made from fermented honey.  The latter is far less sweet than the flavored variety. </p>
<p>The driest variety is sparkling Novgorod (Russian) Mead. You have to make it yourself, as it is not available even at Renaissance Faires. The basic recipe is 67% spring water, 33% honey, and brewer&rsquo;s yeast intended for ale.  Natural honey is a must, since the taste of the finished product depends on it. It reuires the strongest Champagne bottles.</p>

		<p>The phenomenon with mead sails on the coatails of America&rsquo;s reinvention and transition from corporate beer distributorship to independent home brewing.<br>
With names like Samuel Adams, Stoudt&rsquo;s, Ommegang, (Three Philosophers), Anchor, and Dogfish Head, America has finally reinvented herself from the big corporation and on to building a new and broader reputation as a country of refined beverage.</p>
<p>Although its uncertain how high meads popularity will rise with its uniqueness and alcohol content of 8%+, mead will definitely add to the popularity of the independent breweries.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve brewed mead, cider and what the English used to call a &#8220;pyment&#8221;.</p>
<p>A pyment is a honey mead with white wine grape juice co-fermented with it.  </p>
<p>I prefer cider.  For a five-gallon batch, I use 12 cans of cheap apple juice from Wal Mart, two pounds of beet sugar, and half a packet of Lalvin wine yeast.  It comes out exquisitely alcoholic, about 10%.  Homebrewed mead takes a little longer to get started because honey is naturally antibiotic, but the stuff I make also ends up at about 10%.  It&rsquo;ll get a fellow spun.</p>
