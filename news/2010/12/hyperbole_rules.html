<h1>Hyperbole Rules in Muslim Debate</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe R. Hicks and David A. Lehrer, Daily News (Los Angeles), December 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>WITHOUT serious debate or examination, the Los Angeles City Council recently passed a resolution that opposes &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221; and &#8220;repudiates&#8221; random acts of violence against Muslims. </p>
<p>This admittedly ceremonial resolution apparently accepts the premise that residents of the city commit acts of hate against Muslims so often that it warrants an official resolution from city leaders condemning and repudiating these acts. Is this really the case? </p>
<p>According to the latest hate crime report from the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations, {snip} [h]ate crimes that targeted Muslims (3 percent) ranked slightly above those directed at Scientologists (1 percent). In fact, the commission found that attacks against Christians (8 percent) outnumbered attacks against Muslims. </p>
<p>In any case, the actual number of reported hate crimes based on religion is quite small. In a county that has more than 10 million highly diverse residents, only a total of 131 crimes based on religion took place in all of 2009. {snip}</p>
<p>Since only 3 percent of 131 hate crimes during 2009 was directed against Muslims, it&rsquo;s difficult to understand why city leaders would pass a resolution that zeroes in on the category that has the next-to-lowest numbers recorded by the County&rsquo;s Human Relations </p>
<p>It appears that the City Council simply took information provided by an advocacy group, one that&rsquo;s hardly unbiased, and uncritically spat out a resolution opposing &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221; and &#8220;random acts of violence against Muslim-Americans.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Factually, there is no alarming number of attacks against Muslim-Americans. According to the FBI, the largest number of recorded hate crimes against Muslim-Americans took place in 2001. That year the number dramatically escalated from only 28 in 2000 to 481 in 2001  &mdash;  the year that young Muslim men drove planes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field outside of Shanksville, Pa., murdering 3,000 innocent Americans in the name of Islam. </p>

<p>Does that mean we have a new category of thought crimes? Not only do we have hate crimes, we now have fear crimes. </p>

		<p>Well, this is what happens when you have a government that is utterly incompetent. They engage in this kind of stuff to give the appearance of doing something and to hide that incompetence.</p>

<p>Right. NOT only is there not an alarming number of such, there are in reality very few cases.</p>
<p>What is so remarkable is that there are not so many of these cases but that there are so FEW!</p>

		<p>This is just another example of how utterly illogical liberal thinking is. LA is on the verge of bankruptcy, and here these fools have nothing better to do than spend precious time over such frivolity. God help them, they need it!</p>

		<p>Much of the same hyperbole exists in liberal thinking about &#8220;white racism.&#8221; Liberals would rather read history books about white violence against blacks, than news stories about black violence against whites.  </p>

		<p>The LA City Council is populated with radical hispanics, liberals, and buffoons.  They would love nothing better than wasting time and money passing warm and fuzzy &#8220;feel good&#8221; legislation that accomplishes nothing.  For 30 years they have also been preaching about minority-women business goals, &#8220;Green Power&#8221;, &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;electric cars&#8221; and establishing mandates for them that were never based in reality.  But they sounded so good.</p>

		<p>I was born and raised in L.A. My folks were and their folks were, dating back to the late 19th century. I never knew a muslim. My folks didn&rsquo;t know any muslims.</p>
<p>The L.A. that I knew and that our forefathers knew (the place of Hollywood Greats and engineering miracles and an economy greater than most nations) is DEAD. It was bludgeoned before our eyes by third-world non-White immigrants. Period.</p>

		<p>If you added up the IQ of the Los Angeles City Council members it would come out to be a amazing 150 below plant life.  The number of attacks by Muslims against American citizens is staggering compared to the reverse.  Here is a site that has the facts and it is just one of many sites that say the same thing.  <br>
   <a href="https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/Pages/AmericanAttacks.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/Pages/AmericanAttacks.htm</a>  and this doesn&rsquo;t even count the 9/11 attack.  Just like your typical liberal brain dead Marxist puke they can&rsquo;t even do the basic research that is required to prove a point.  However the truth, facts, common sense, intelligence, and competence are words that don&rsquo;t fit in with the liberal agenda which is lies, hate, brainwashing and fraud.  Liberal ideology is a disease of the mind that attacks all brain cells until there is nothing left or is the left nothing? </p>

		<p>Hitler did the same thing by putting in all kinds of nominally &#8216;economic&rsquo; driven legislation which gradually narrowed the free space around Jews, Marxists and Unionists in pre-WWII Germany.  Of course it helped that he and Bormann had set up a shadow government which defacto replaced civil law through the regional, district and municipal hierarchies of public control.</p>
<p>Essentially the &#8216;miracle&rsquo; of a 34 percent to 0 unemployment rate in 3 years was a confidence trick based on industrial dispossession, false statistics, huge deficit spending and the outright thievery of the German gold reserves.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t laugh at a law that is emminently absurd until you realize that someone with some brains has likely foreseen the condition where it&rsquo;s application as criminal control has real use.</p>

		<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t the LA City Council do something about white school children being racially attacked by blacks and hispanics? This has been a major problem since the introduction of forced bussing in the 70&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s actually a real crime that still happens every day. Why are they worried about imagined crimes that almost never happen?</p>
<p>LA is a dead city. I used to live there 15 years ago. It was bad then, it seems much worse now  I used to live in a predominately  Iranian neighborhood Some were Jewish, some Muslim. Believe it or not, it was very safe compared to the rest of the city. </p>

		<p>I read the LA Hate Crimes report and there is a large section devoted to hate crimes perpetuated by White Supremacists:</p>
<p><i>24% of hate crimes showed evidence of white supremacist<br>
ideology, most frequently the use of swastikas or other symbols of hatred&hellip;as a percent of all hate crimes, they increased from 20% to 24%.</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this for a second.  It is a false flag tactic to create fear and loathing of Whites, for fund raising purposes, but also to incite continued hatred of Whites.</p>
<p>Yes, there always must be a White Bogeyman!  Even in a city with a very small, shrinking and dying White population - a real White population, not a hispanic or middle eastern one passed off as White to beef up White numbers.  </p>
<p>A Euro-American White in Los Angeles is a  <i>rara avis in terris, nigroque simillima.</i></p>
<p>According to the LA Sheriff&rsquo;s department, the following groups in Los Angeles offer victim assistance and help with reporting Hate Crimes:</p>
<p>American - Arab Anti Discrimination Committee www.adc.org<br>
Anti-Defamation League www.adl.org<br>
Japanese American Citizens League www.jacl.org<br>
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund <br>
Muslim Public Affairs Council <br>
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People <br>
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force <br>
Organization of Chinese Americans<br>
Simon Wiesenthal Center<br>
South Asian Network<br>
Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Martin Luther King Legacy Association	</p>
<p>Notice any <b>minority</b> group in Los Angeles that is missing from the Sheriff&rsquo;s list?</p>
<p>Oh!  That&rsquo;s right!  Whites can never, ever be considered a member of a minority group, especially as pertains to Hate Crimes, even when our numbers fall to 11% of the population.</p>
