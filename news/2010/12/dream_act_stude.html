		<p>Thanks invaders, you just made our case against your kind, for us. Illegal alien and criminal invaders have no rights and are in no position to make demands, let alone make demands by threats. Real smart move threatening violence against us, because the anger among whites towards violent Hispanic illegal alien trash and the hostile alien elites in Washington will explode into bloody battles and civil war. Your ilk has no grasp of history, let alone common sense. Go ahead and riot, it would make our day. It&rsquo;s your kind who&rsquo;d better watch out, because you are going to find that within our ranks is a monster. When awakened it will be filled with a ruthless, merciless and terrible resolve to expel or eliminate all of you. Get ready to die in droves when you make  good your threats.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s important for people to understand that such outrageous threats by mestizos is no more than childish ranting, and none of them constitute any kind of threat.  </p>
<p>The reason I write that is because they have allowed their home countries to evolve into corrupt drug states where the politicians, police and many in the military are involved with dealing drugs, and they lack any ability at all to create a successful society.  Allowing such deterioration in a nation is proof positive that the inhabitants are cowards who rant and rave, but never act.  If they were granted citizenship here, they would allow the same kind of degeneration.</p>
<p>Did they fight corruption, desiring to make their country a better place.  No, they did not.  The fled like cowards to another country, because their own was taken from them, due to their lack of courage and failure to demand justice.</p>
<p>We have nothing to be concerned about from these people.  They have shown ample evidence that they will allow themselves to be bullied, harried and harassed with not so much as a peep in protest.</p>
<p>They represent no threat to anyone but themselves.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t get the generic cry for latino unity.  This is near exclusively about illegal aliens, emphasis illegal.  The US has a long history of legal latinos, now defined to include Puerto Ricans.  Puerto Ricans have long been US citizens.  The US also has a large Cuban population. While not without its problems, those populations are not part of the current DREAM act.<br>
The core issue is the States cannot afford to support illegals.  And the Federal government has done a poor job of protecting our southern border where a continual stream of impoverished Mexicans and South Americans stream into our country.  Aside from the issue of a breach of our laws and the ensuing economic burden, such large amounts have come and are not assimilating.  This means generations of economically dependent populations.  I would add, that if we allow the benefits of citizenship for merely crossing the border, we encourage that behavior all the more.  <br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, Aldemar, we&rsquo;re watching.  Very closely.  And more of us are watching every day.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Olivia Perez, an <b>undocumented</b> student who claims she was forced to fill out false paperwork in order to stay in the United States, says, &ldquo;Latinos need to fight back. We need to march. We need to scream. If necessary, we need to riot. We need to do everything Blacks did to get their civil rights!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Sidestepping for the moment the rather obvious point that blacks were at least legally born here, I hope Olivia does exactly what she says.  Nothing would do a better job of awakening the media-hypnotized White giant from its slumber.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Ms. Cruz [Elena Cruz of the Center for Latino Right] tells this column. &ldquo;We need to do our best to show this country how Latinos fit into the American Dream. We lost today, but we will prove ourselves very soon.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>So&hellip;what&rsquo;s been stopping you up to this point, Elena?  We&rsquo;re still waiting for you to show us how the Nation of Aztlan is some sort of patriotic American organization.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, is anyone else getting as sick as I am of that phrase &#8220;The American Dream?&#8221;  As far as I can tell, it&rsquo;s mestizo code for &#8220;welfare and free medical care.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;This is war!&rdquo; claims Phoenix student Aldemar Cruz. &ldquo;Republicans may have stopped the DREAM Act, but they won&rsquo;t prevent La Reconquista from happening.: I have to agree with these two points. Mexico has basically declared war upon the United States; whether or not the United States understands this doesn&rsquo;t really matter. Mexicans will continue efforts at Reconquista no matter what and particularly if we do nothing to stop them.  As it is now, with our country having gone through the last 45 years of immigration treason, I would gladly trade the lower Southwest for having all Hispanics move out of every other area of a new, non-Hispanicly tainted, nation. Although, given the highly unlikely scenario of that happnening peacefully, it may well come to a warfare type situation that Mr. Cruz seems to desire.  Otherwise though, I just do not see any reason for sending our sons and daughters to die in order to take back Los Angeles.</p>

		<p>Ms Cruz, we understand full well that you are a mouthpiece for Reconquista, and are merely trying to put a good face on the movement.  We also understand that the truth face, and arrogance, of the illegal alien invasion is exactly as Aldemar puts it.  The real face of illegal aliens is one of anger, hatred for Whites, lust for services and benefits they have no right to at our expense, and ultimately to &#8220;retake&#8221; that which they never conquered in the first place.  La REconquista?  Are they really silly enough to want a war with us?  They care nothing about OUR history, and appear that they know nothing about their own.  Spanish (europeans) conquered them.  French (europeans) conquered them.  Most recently European Americans conquered them not once but twice at least.<br>
Your gang mentality, Ms and Mr Cruz, does not serve well for organized military conquest except perhaps against your own disorganized, corrupt military.  Moreover, our blacks were CITIZENS when they marched.  YOU ARE NOT.  </p>
<p>Frankly, I hope you carry out your threats.  It will show the true face of the illegal invader.  Not only will amnesty not happen for a generation, but every one of you will find yourselves in either prison or detention camps, and ultimately deported.  Whites will FINALLY wake up and realize that you invaders are NOT the nanny next door.  You are criminals, thugs, drug dealers, rapists, child traffickers, extortionists, gang bangers, engaged in public service fraud, and by your own admission you &#8220;had&#8221; to adopt fraudulent papers to even be here and go to school.  PLEASE.  riot.<br>
so we can identify you all, round you up, and SEND YOU ALL PACKING.</p>

		<p> If Cruz wants to ethnically cleanse the southwest of whites and reunite it with Mexico, does he also have plans to wage war against the 9% of Mexicans who claim to be of unmixed European ancestry? After all, back in ol&rsquo; Me-hee-co, the entertainment, polical and business elites are dispropotionately from this 9% of the population. Why aren&rsquo;t militant mestizos like Cruz and Perez threatening riots in their motherland where the aforementioned white-ish elites have rigged the system to their advantage while the majority of Mexicans still remained mired in poverty and continue to aspire to move north? We had hundreds of thousands of Mexicans marching under Mexican flags on America&rsquo;s streets a few years back when they should have instead been back in their home counrty protesting the ruling class&rsquo; refusal to invest in education, infrastructure, job creation and the like so they wouldn&rsquo;t have to move to the US. </p>

		<p>These people just don&rsquo;t get it! For that matter, neither do the people who sponsored &#8220;The Dream Act&#8221;. First, the act is stating, in so many words that &#8220;yes, breaking our law is acceptable to us.&#8221; It states that, after a period of time, breaking our law will be forgiven. Further, breaking our law will be rewarded with lower tuitions than we will charge many of our own citizens. It states that we will actually provide a privilege that our own citizens cannot obtain - that of the award of lower cost tuition to a school in a state of the illegal immigrant&rsquo;s son or daughter chooses to attend. </p>
<p>If such a preposterous law is passed, it not only assigns a lesser status of rights and privileges to a native born or law abiding legal immigrant, student, it essentially makes the statement that &#8220;this is a nation of laws, not of men&#8221; a lie. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone a long way toward dismantling the concept that this is a nation of laws, not of men. The evidence is in the angry reaction of the illegal immigrant students cited in the article. They believe that they are entitled to such a great exception to our laws. They would not receive such an exception in Mexico, or Guatemala, or Honduras. They expect it here however, because our lawmakers have taught them to do so. If we had passed the Dream Act or if we continue to propose such stupid, treasonous laws, we will be truly finished as a nation. The very people that the law blindly seeks to help will also be diminished. <br>
The U.S. citizens and law makers that sponsored the Dream Act are guilty of treason. That our elitist leaders proposed such a thing proves they care little for our citizens or our nation.</p>

		<p> The problem with a race war is that the Federal Government would always side with any race except the whites.<br>
 They have put so much money, time, effort and programs in place to control the white population that they would rather completely destroy ( to a point of total genocide), rather than lose control of our race.<br>
 The military would not hesitate to bring all major weapons to bear on any significant number of whites to help the other races win this race war. Then the whites in the military and all police agencies would be eradicated.<br>
 Cant&rsquo;t happen? The current administration has repeatedly shown that their leanings are to wrest total control from the majority in order to more easily control the rest of America.</p>

		<p>Seriously? They claim they are just American dream seeking immigrants but when something does not work in their favor, they declare war against the natives. How peaceful and evolved they must think themselves to be. </p>
<p>All they are doing is reaffirming every belief that racial realist and many Americans hold, that they are invaders.  They do not want to work to become Americans; they just want to conquer a white nation because their former was so terrible. <br>

		<p>So tell me Mr. Perez, are you getting ready to star in a &#8216;Terminator&rsquo; sequel or was that your last arrest photo?  It does little to give weight to your writing but boy it sure is scary!</p>
<p>Is that honestly the image you intend to put forward on the eve of your fellows declaring war upon us?</p>
<p>Aside from the obvious of mooching off social welfare freebies, what part does a inveterately poor, uneducated (illiterate in their native language), illegal population have in a rich, technologically advanced, one with a 22% real unemployment rate?</p>
<p>Oh that&rsquo;s right, voting for the Democrats&hellip;</p>
<p>But wait!  Aren&rsquo;t a significant number of them now also part of the oppressed, unemployed, mindless zombie hordes?  I could&rsquo;ve sworn I read something about that in November.</p>

		<p>I sincerely believe this is not just rhetoric from the margins.  </p>
<p>The nation of Hispanics have developed a headstrong will to get their way, and will not accept resistance.  </p>
<p>Like other regimes before them, the government will try to buy their loyalty with greenbacks. Its the only card they can play which will preserve political capital. </p>

		<p>I never thought it would happen to me, but I recently had a run-in with a &#8220;Reconquista&#8221; Mexican at my school.  All the other Hispanics I&rsquo;d known up to this point were pretty friendly, to be honest (and trust me, there&rsquo;s a lot here).  Generally, they have been very like-able people.  In fact, I was beginning to wonder, &#8220;Are there really any Mexicans who want to reconquer the Southwest?  Or are organizations such as Aztlan and MEChA just fringe groups?&#8221;  And then, one day, I made a little comment about how one of my teachers should find some Mexicans to clean out his fish tank, and as everyone&rsquo;s laughing, this Hispanic girl who I&rsquo;d never talked to before but was in the same class comes up and says &#8220;What did he just say?!?&#8221; (apparently she couldn&rsquo;t confront me directly, she had to ask my friends what I had said) and they wouldn&rsquo;t tell, but to get her to go away I eventually told her what I said, and she gets all b****y on me and says &#8220;You know, Mexicans do all the work white and black people are too lazy to do.  You can&rsquo;t stop us, we&rsquo;re coming.&#8221; And then, she actually said, &#8220;F*** the USA!&#8221;  This is in a public school, mind you (she didn&rsquo;t say it too loud though), just a few feet away from an American flag.</p>
<p>So, I just had my first experience with one of those kinds of immigrants, the kind who come to take over.  And it wasn&rsquo;t pleasant, but I did learn something; although most Mexicans truly don&rsquo;t have dreams of reconquering the Southwestern states (including my state of Texas), there are some who do.  And, although all non-white immigration must be curbed for various reasons, it is only the small number of Mexicans who come here to conquer who we have to be really wary of.</p>

		<p>demanding more and more because this country is too weak willed to say NO in the first place.  These demanders smell weakness.  The blacks are worse off than prior to civil rights after wasting billions of tax money.  This country is being run into the ground because of the inability to say NO.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The DREAM Act would have provided amnesty for many children of undocumented immigrants who had no choice in their arrival to the United States. It would have also provided amnesty to all of their family members WHO COME FROM LANDS THAT WERE STOLEN BY THE UNITED STATES.&#8221; (My caps).</p>
<p>That is not normal wording for a mainstream U.S. newspaper! Can anyone enlighten me as to who owns these mysterious &#8220;Examiner&#8221; papers that seemed to spring up spontaneously just a few years ago in many of our major cities? </p>

Sorry, WhiteRaven. It is false reassurances like your quoted  (in part) advice above that has led to this situation in the first place. Native-born White Americans need to wake up to the fact that these people are NOT children. They mean every word they say. They hate us and they are determined to erase us from the face of the earth. </p>
<p>Why any of them are even allowed to stay in this country after openly declaring war upon the citizens is beyond me. They should be handcuffed, taken to the border and shoved out on the other side. There should be a physical barrier preventing their entry/re-entry to OUR country. Everyone seems to shy away from building a wall. They say it smacks of the Berlin Wall. Remember this, the Berlin Wall was built to keep people IN. This would be a wall to keep invaders OUT.<br>
 <br>
Do you have a fence around your home? Do you lock your doors at night? Why doesn&rsquo;t our country?<br>
 <br>
We need to round them up, by force if necessary, and deport them all. This includes their spouses/live-ins and others who have freely consented to breed with them, and all their children, whether they were born here or not. The children are proving themselves to have been cut from the same ungrateful, entitlement seeking, arrogant cloth as their invading, law breaking parents. </p>
<p>They claim they are &#8220;living in the shadows&#8221;. The above quoted statements (13  &mdash;  E Pluribus Pluribus) put the lie to that statement quite clearly. They are not &#8220;living in the shadows&#8221; They intend to take over and they  have let us know in advance. People who sit back and say, &#8220;they are children&#8221; &#8220;They don&rsquo;t mean it&#8221; &#8220;They can&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t REALLY do anything&#8221; are half the problem. WAKE UP WHITE MAN! They are already here, and they plan to kill you and dispossess your children.<br>
The DREAM act is just phase one of the nightmare that is about to decend upon Americans if something isn&rsquo;t done, and done fast.     <br>

My sweet little 67-year-old relative was LIVID, ranting and raving about the illegals protesting in Chicago over the DREAM act.  Her 40-year-old daughter is ticked off over the increasing numbers of Mexicans she sees at the stores, jabbering away in Spanish.  She (the 40-year-old) recently had a scuffle with her daughter&rsquo;s school because they were catering to Spanish-speaking anchor babies, at the expense of the white kids.</p>

		<p>Notice how brave the Hispanics are when it comes to threatening white people.  However, they are very afraid to threaten their own government and law enforcement in order to create better lives for themselves in their OWN country.  This shows me that they believe they can criticize white people with impunity because most of us don&rsquo;t fight back. Also, deep down, many of them are racists but they use historical racial grievances and pro-immigration enforcement reasons as excuses to project their racism onto white Americans. We need to peacefully fight against illegal immigration and for our Western culture.</p>

		<p>These students have been the beneficiaries of America&rsquo;s overly generous welfare policies with no clue whatsoever that those many benefits are provided by those same White people that these cockroaches denigrate. Hell, the command/control government <i>favors</i>  non-White colonists over Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Illegal colonists have been steeped in anti-White culture via the media and K-12 academia, believe the Southwest belongs to them, that Whites stole this land from from its rightful owner, Mexico.  </p>
<p>The mandated high school textbooks I am compelled to use are filled with stories of noble Mexicans as helpless victims of White hatred and oppression.</p>
<p>Little do they know or understand their primary role as the hostile elites&rsquo; disposable Useless Idiots, primed to carry out White destruction.</p>
<p>I do not believe Mexicans will skitter back across the border when government services dry up, as they are in California with its 26 billion dollar deficit; they believe this is their land and that any and all wealth and property, ALL OF IT, accrued by Whites belongs to them. </p>
<p>They will attack without mercy those who they feel are responsible for their misery:  White Americans.</p>
<p>I sense a growing hostility in the Mexican population in California.  I see it in their eyes and the looks they level at me and other Whites.</p>
<p>And, we Whites will receive no help from the government.</p>
<p>Victor David Hanson, author of <i>Mexifornia</i> and the recent article <i>Two Californias</i> writes (with very slight editing):</p>
<p><i>Students in classes hear of the sins of America more often than its attractions.</i> </p>
<p><i>So there is a surreal nature to these protests: something like, &#8216;Please do not send me back to the culture I nostalgically praise; please let me stay in the culture that deprecate!&rsquo; I think the DREAM Act protestors might have been far more successful if they explained why, in fact, they want to stay. What it is about America that they desire to remain rather than return to the place of their birth?</i> </p>
<p>Mr. Hanson is from a small Central Valley town near where my grandparents lived.  Last time I was through there (For the Final Time), I had a lot of trouble finding and recognizing the house in which I spent a lot of time as a child   &mdash;   the once-neat sidewalk was torn up into rubble, the three beautiful sycamore trees my grandfather planted in the front yard that provided shade in the 100+ degree heat were ripped out, the driveway and lawn were missing, now completely dirt and covered with trash and broken toys, the white picket fence that kept us from running in the street was torn out, the small orchard in the back completely gone.</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s satanic taxes and onerous business regulations are driving productive Californians out of the state at the rate of 2,000 - 3,000 per week as Third World Mexicans and Central Americans continue to pour over the border for welfare benefits.</p>
<p>This is the culture that is going to provide the California&rsquo;s &#8220;next generation of doctors, lawyers, scientists, business leaders and politicians.&#8221;</p>

<p>In response to the statement by Lorin (14) that the Federal government will always side with nonwhites, I doubt that will happen when the mestizos start beheading cops and car-bombing police stations here, the way they are already doing in Mexico.</p>

		<p>4-Whiteraven- I think it&rsquo;s important for people to understand that such outrageous threats by mestizos is no more than childish ranting, and none of them constitute any kind of threat. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to address this and point out a few problematic facts that most Americans are not aware of&hellip;..or may simply be in denial about.</p>
<p>The first and foremost is that these people are absolutely serious. They intend WAR.  Not allegorically but the real thing.  They are not exactly shy about saying so either.  La Raza, in particular, is fond of showing off strength in numbers and explicitly spelling out their intentions to ethnically cleanse white people from a future state of Aztlan, they plan to carve out of the southern United States and Northern Mexico.  An incredibly HUGE amount of guns, grenades, machine guns, military hardware and uniforms have been seized making its way over the border.  What has not been seized?  These are not criminals.  Criminals want mostly handguns, and perhaps something shiny to keep in the trunk or pose with, safely away from the cops.  And they certainly don&rsquo;t wear military uniforms.  Militias do this.  Paramilitary types do this.  An army gathering in secret does this.  Americans better wake up to the fact that they are indeed doing this.  People spouting off don&rsquo;t try to smuggle thousands and thousands of AK-47s into the country.  That is the bottom line.</p>
<p>The second thing is the race of those involved.  This has been hidden by our communist media (who, make no mistake, understands fully what is going on and firmly sides with THEM).  They love to use the term &#8220;hispanic&#8221; as a way to imply that the mexicans in the US are the same as the mexicans who run the government and the normal society in mexico.  They are not.  Normal &#8220;mexicans&#8221; are white.  They live a life pretty much in line with a middle class, upper middle class American lifestyle.  Most are educated.  None would ever consider immigrating to the US.</p>
<p>The &#8220;hispanics&#8221; causing the problem are mestizos.  A completely different racial group that does not mix with whites.  They are basically south american indian and wage near constant war with whites and blacks who speak spanish, no matter the country.</p>
<p>And that is what is going on in mexico&hellip;.a bloody, racial civil war where one race is attempting to wrest at least partial control of the country (and a good chunk of our own country) from another.  In good maoist fashion, they have the aid of a hostile state&hellip;&hellip;our own.</p>
<p>What has turned them into dangerous people is American welfare funneled into the drug trade and related slave (mostly children trafficked for sex) and weapons trade.  This is intentional.  Heck, it&rsquo;s the real reason welfare exists at all (which is the main reason it must be dismantled&hellip;.or else face a bloody third world war).<br>

		<p>Unfortunately, our more militant white nationalists most likely will not get their wish.  Despite a few big mouths, Hispanics will probably keep fairly quiet and will not riot or pillage.  They will continue to arrive and to breed.  They will continue ethnically cleansing us on a local level everywhere.  They will use the democratic system to increase their legislative and judicial power.  They will breed with the less astute members of our population (quite a few of us).  Even if there were a few riots, whites would just &#8220;tut-tut&#8221; like we did after the Rodney King incidents.  (If we were going to fight our racial competitors, shouldn&rsquo;t that have ignited something?)  Asian and other aliens will gradually gain more levers of power.</p>
<p>Our young are already lost.  Our ship may just keep sinking, slowly, until it is gone.  Not from war, but from decay and neglect.  As Chief Seattle said, &#8220;tribe follows tribe &hellip; the white man&rsquo;s time will surely come.&#8221;  I hope I am wrong.  There does seem to be a slight change in the direction of the wind.</p>

<p>Any kind of such threats should be taken very seriously, even if the people making them seem laughable right now. We know from their history, and even from what&rsquo;s going on in Mexico today, that Mexicans can be vicious and are capable of great violence. They are no joke.</p>
