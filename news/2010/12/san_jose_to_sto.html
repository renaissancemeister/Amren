<h1><a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_16810554?nclick_check=1">San Jose to Stop 30-Day Car Impounds for Unlicensed Drivers</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sean Webby, San Jose Mercury News, Dec. 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a sudden U-turn after years of complaints, the San Jose Police Department is expected as early as next week to stop impounding cars for a month when unlicensed drivers are nabbed for minor traffic violations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the proposal has raised concern from at least one City Council member, immigrant advocates say the 30-day vehicle holds unfairly target undocumented residents. Latino advocacy groups have long protested that the vehicle seizures deprived working-class people of their cars  &mdash;  which cost thousands of dollars in charges and fines to retrieve, often exceeding the worth of the car itself.</p>
<p>The new policy would give officers the option of allowing the driver to park the vehicle and have a licensed driver pick it up that day. If the car is towed, a licensed driver can pick it up almost immediately and pay applicable fees and fines, but without having to wait 30 days.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m so happy. This won&rsquo;t help me anymore, but it will help a lot of people,&#8221; said Inma, whose Nissan Xterra was impounded this year after her husband, an undocumented immigrant with no license, received a traffic citation on his way to work. </p>
<p>It took Inma, who declined to give her full name to protect her husband, a month and about $3,000 from savings and loans to retrieve her car.</p>
<p>&#8220;These people are not allowed to get licenses here; they would if they could,&#8221; Inma said. </p>
<p>State law allows for such impoundments, but San Jose is joining a host of other Bay Area cities  &mdash;  including Berkeley, Oakland and San Francisco  &mdash;  that have recently changed their policies. </p>
<p>&#8220;When you have a policy of towing cars solely because the drivers don&rsquo;t have a license, it really undercuts the trust between the immigrant community and police,&#8221; said Mark Silverman, an immigration attorney who has helped community groups craft impound policy recommendations in many Bay Area cities, including San Jose. &#8220;That is the major reason that the police have cooperated in this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acting police Chief Chris Moore said he agreed to the change after being approached in recent weeks by City Councilman Sam Liccardo.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is by no means a change that allows people to drive without a valid license. That is still illegal,&#8221; Moore added. &#8220;But the intent of the tow policy was to remove those drivers from the road, and the problem is that it&rsquo;s not doing that.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But not everybody thinks the change is a good idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that unlicensed drivers and drivers with suspended licenses are a huge threat to public safety,&#8221; said City Councilman Pete Constant, a former San Jose police officer. &#8220;I think when the Legislature created the ability for police officers to impound the cars, they gave them a very, very valuable tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that tool was so egregious to some that San Jose church-affiliated groups have complained to the city for years. </p>

		<p>This is perhaps the most important thing to understand about criminal third world invaders and their intentions.</p>
<p>Once they take over an areas demographically, they quickly move to shut down the rule of law.  Vote in government handouts for themselves, exemption from laws like drunk driving and civil fines and procedures.  They often do this formally by changing the laws.  But most often, they do it extrajudicially by simply ignoring the law, selectively.</p>
<p>I think a good example of how far they will go happened recently in Long Island.  A man used an AK 47 (legal civilian model) to defend his family from a vicious mexican gang who attempted to storm his house and murder them all.  They yelled quite clearly and quite loudly, their intent to murder the family, especially the children.  A few warning shots dispersed them.</p>
<p>What happened next is the local police arrested him and attempted to charge him with various crimes that had no merit.  Everything he did was perfectly legal in New York.  The problem is, there is no real rule of law where he lived.  Only expensive legal representation combined with the story becoming national news, resulted in his release.</p>
<p>Most importantly, despite every one of the attackers being known, none of them were arrested.  The intent is perfectly crystal clear&hellip;&hellip;to allow them to murder this man and his family as a warning to others, preferably after disarming him.</p>
<p>The police and local officials work for the gang and ignore the law&hellip;.to the point of allowing murder to enforce the gangs will.  Why?</p>
<p>Because everyone in the gang, everyone employed by the police and everyone in that local government are mestizos.</p>
<p>Something to think about&hellip;&hellip;.carefully.</p>

		<p>I think a better way to solve the problem would be to jail the driver for 30 days, seize the car permanently and if the driver was a illegal alien deport him after his 30 days in jail. <br>
It is just common sense to keep the law abiding citizens safe.<br>
And how about that car insurance? Do they have that at all.</p>

<p>An illegal alien trespassing in the United States, violating employment laws, violating motor vehicle laws and stealing public services&hellip;but can&rsquo;t get arrested. </p>
<p>Instead he&rsquo;ll get his XTerra back and remain free.  Laws are flexible because the business lobby runs the justice system.</p>

<p>If church&rsquo;s feel that they as an organization have the right to attempt to force changes in law, they ought to be tax paying organizations.  No doubt, the Catholic churches are the ones invovlved here.</p>
<p>Catholic churches in California have long served as safe havens for illegals, providing clothing, food, and arranging shelter for illegals.  They could be accused of racketeering since their activities skirt state and federal laws and enable a number of rackets, including drug smuggling and selling, to succeed.</p>

		<p>Are we to think that Hispanics are the only &#8220;working class&#8221; people in San Jose?  I guess there are no white working class people there, or anywhere.  Then again, thanks to all the Hispanics, there really can be no viable working middle class of native born white Americans.  That&rsquo;s because the Hispanics really aren&rsquo;t &#8220;working class&#8221; in the way you and I think of them   &mdash;   I don&rsquo;t consider welfare dependents and fodder for cheap off-the-books labor &#8220;working class.&#8221;</p>

		<p>So now we have four sets of laws?  One for illegal hispanics, one for blacks and US born hispanics, one for white woman and lastly one for white men?  The last two groups being the only ones expected to obey the most stupid laws (like the recent finning of an 80 year old woman for throwing a newspaper in a city trash bin).  The last group the only one it is legal to persecute and discriminate against.  Even if the nation stays together as a poltical entity defined by lines on a map it is doomed to fourth world status.</p>

		<p>I would bet that once the new procedure is in place for a while, they would find most of the illegals driving without a license will be back on the road in the same car in a couple of days.</p>

		<p>If one of these miscreants is stopped and THEN continues to drive and THEN is involved in an accident, San Jose will be liable in civil court to the extent that the government will become bankrupt. ONLY takes a couple of cases and the lesson will be learned. Civil court action can get results in a way that other &#8220;measures&#8221; fail. </p>

<p>Poor Poor illegal alien invaders! BUT! still able to gather $3000 from &#8220;savings&#8221; Isn&rsquo;t an Xterra an SUV of some sort? rather expensive if I recall and the &#8220;undocumented worker&#8221; has a job that allows him to save that much in the first place! obviously not picking lettuce under the table. I too wonder if these &#8220;people&#8221; have insurance, I suspect not, that would violate some sort of ILLEGAL ALIEN RIGHTS I&rsquo;m sure.<br>

		<p>In South Carolina, a state without a HUGE ILLEGAL ALIEN problem, if you get caught with no driving license or no insurance (either one) and your car is impounded until you provide proof of either or both! NO EXCEPTIONS.</p>

		<p>I live here in San Jose and I am left scratching my head&hellip;&hellip;I believe California also has a law simply stating that if you do not have liability insurance your car will be impounded immediately and the registration suspended.  Boo to you San Jose, it is patently unfair that I have to pay for uninsured motorist coverage, all the while you are allowing uninsured motorists to be on the road.  I think San Jose P.D. needs to remove, &#8220;To Serve and Protect from their vehicles&#8221;. </p>

		<p><i>Once they take over an areas demographically, they quickly move to shut down the rule of law.</i></p>
<p>Hispanics want the same rights afforded blacks:  Exemption from the Rule of Law   &mdash;   in particular, they want the Legal Right to drive on American roads drunk, with unregistered cars, lack of a driver&rsquo;s license and no insurance.</p>
<p>And, it seems to be working:</p>
<p><i>The accused killer, Carlos Montano, slammed head-on into the nun&rsquo;s car, in his third drunk-driving incident in five years. He had twice been slated for deportation but somehow was released onto public streets.</i></p>
<p><i>The Obama administration will not release the results of an investigation into why an illegal immigrant with two drunk driving convictions went almost two years without a deportation hearing before a crash that killed a Virginia nun, a senior official said.</i></p>
<p>You see, only Native Born White Americans are mandated to follow American Laws.</p>

		<p>Next time we pay our auto insurance (including &#8220;uninsured motorist&#8221; protection), next time we pay our state car registration fees, next time we pay taxes on a car purchase, next time we pay sales taxes of all kinds that pay for roads and police officers and EMT&rsquo;s and schools, next time we pay income taxes to the federal government and the state government &hellip; let us remember the poor illegal invaders.</p>
<p>Boy, I sure hope they get that darned DREAM Act passed. Golly, then the illegal invaders can not pay for car insurance or registration as they drive on our dime to our colleges and not pay for that too. Just makes me feel warm, fuzzy, and goose-pimply all over.  </p>

		<p> I&rsquo;ve said it before, but it bears repeating: In a multicultural society logic demands that every aspect of all cultures be tolerated. <br>
 The main thrust of the multicultarist is for White America to tolerate everything to a point of possible destruction of our entire way of life or be labeled racist or the new term recently touted by the SPLC &#8220;hater&#8221;.<br>
 At some point white America will either  have to take a stand or completely surrender to the liberals pushing this agenda. No matter which way it goes; it&rsquo;s not going too be a pleasent experience.</p>
