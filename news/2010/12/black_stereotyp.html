			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tyree Harris, Oregonian (Portland, Oregon), December 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Through high school, I struggled with my identity as a black male. I was sometimes called &#8220;white&#8221; because of the way I talked, and I was called &#8220;weird&#8221; because of the classes I took. But nothing offended me quite like when I heard people calling me a &#8220;sellout.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was by far the most offensive thing I&rsquo;ve ever been called. Calling me a sellout is accusing me of sacrificing the beauty of my culture for an assimilation into &#8220;the white way.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Just about any black person who does well in school faces these accusations. It&rsquo;s an issue that&rsquo;s exclusive to our culture  &mdash;  the smarter we get, the harder it is to be accepted by our community.</p>
<p>To many of us, being black means being like what we see on TV: It&rsquo;s the clothes we wear, the dialect we speak with and the dysfunctional bad attitude we&rsquo;re stereotyped to have. We&rsquo;ve fallen so deeply into the mold we&rsquo;ve been handed that we&rsquo;ve allowed ignorance to be associated with blackness and intelligence to be associated with whiteness.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Being called a sellout because I don&rsquo;t accept the media-spun perceptions of blackness made me paranoid and uncomfortable. I was afraid to hang out with white people because I didn&rsquo;t want to look like a sellout, and when I did my white &#8220;friends&#8221; would make snarky little race jokes to remind me I was different.</p>
<p>On the same note, I didn&rsquo;t care to hang with a lot of black people because I felt insulted and betrayed by them, and when I did they would make fun of me for trying to be smart or for hanging out with white people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Half asleep on a sofa at my friend&rsquo;s house last month, I flipped the TV on to &#8220;MTV Jams.&#8221; A music video came on with a very obese Rick Ross flaunting his unreasonable amount of tattoos, unreasonable amount of jewelry and half-naked black women in the background.</p>
<p>At first I laughed to myself thinking it was ridiculous, but then T.I., Nelly, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, Birdman and Waka Flocka Flame came on doing the same thing.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m the sellout? We see these rappers as well-grounded in blackness, but we never question the fact that they are millionaires portraying blacks as violent, egotistical and uneducated for the love of money. {snip}</p>
<p>At the risk of making young black minds believe that foolishness is blackness, and at the cost of putting black women in an even worse position, they are recklessly releasing songs that promote the bad aspects of our culture. They go as far as to imply that if we don&rsquo;t take part in them, we&rsquo;re somehow not black.</p>
<p>Standing in front of that camera, flashing that gold, that woman or that car, the rapper is the modern-day Uncle Tom. Bought like livestock, his millions make record labels billions. He loves his record label like the house slave loved his master. He&rsquo;s selling the negative connotations of his culture for money and protecting the hierarchy that&rsquo;s in place  &mdash;  but it&rsquo;s the students who do well in school and try to empower their peers we deem sellouts.</p>

		<p>The guy&rsquo;s right.  Our problem is that since he cannot find comraderie within his own race, he must turn to hanging out with liberal whites.  He will date white women, etc.  I know of someone like him personally.  The guy had a college degree and all the trappings of whiteness.  He married a white woman.  But it ended after two years in divorce, when the wife found that he was having an affair.  I hear of a similar scenario frequently.  I believe Jerry Springer has made a career on this sort of thing. Lipstick on a pig.</p>

		<p>The article was great until he started blaming the (white) record producers for the disgusting performance of modern rappers. Obviously this is what sells to the lowest common denominator so it is mass produced. Unfortunately this sort of thing is forced down the throats of unsuspecting Whites. Hopefully this guy will get it and understand that whites are not the cause of all the problems in the black community. Maybe I give the guy too much credit!</p>

		<p>I almost didn&rsquo;t want to read to the end. I knew it would end up being about the columnist in Oregon celebrating his blackness. Not only does he celebrate his blackness, he even accuses other blacks of being &#8216;uncle toms&rsquo; - not being politically or correctly black enough. </p>

<p>The rapper is glorifying black life, black culture, black life, the entire black male ethos. </p>
<p>The words expressed in the &#8220;genre&#8221; of rap are the true and real thoughts and feelings of the black man in America. The rap producers and stars and not so much &#8220;sellouts&#8221; as merely expressing what is truely felt!</p>

		<p>Positively &#8220;Maxwellian&#8221; in character (Bill Maxwell, St. Petersburg Times). Sample: Highlights from &#8220;Rap&rsquo;s excesses come home to roost, By&#8221; BILL MAXWELL, St. Petersburg Times, October 12, 2003:</p>
<p><br/>
BLACK INTELLECTUALS&rsquo; PAEANS TO HIP-HOP MUSIC AND CULTURE BACKFIRES IN &ldquo;GHETTOPOLY,&rdquo; A TAKEOFF ON MONOPOLY THAT MERCILESSLY LAMPOONS RAP CULTURE:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth were blacks thinking as rap &hellip; glorified the worst of everything - real and imagined  &mdash;  about our [black] culture? Did they not know that smart people looking to capitalize monetarily would be listening and watching? Which is exactly what David T. Chang, creator of Ghettopoly, was doing. He bought the rap videos. He studied them. He listened to the trash talk. He viewed the naked female flesh. He made images of the gold teeth, gold chains, flashy cars, guns and the other melange of rap. The difference is that instead of praising his material, Chang ridicules it mercilessly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BLACK INTELLIGENTSIA GOT WHAT IT DESERVED: </p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot improve on the observations of Chicago Sun-Times columnist Mary Mitchell: &lsquo;The symbols found in Ghettopoly are an accurate reflection of what hip-hop heroes are selling &hellip; Ironically, people are outraged about Urban Outfitters&rsquo; selling a foul board game, but few people of influence seem to care that every record store in America is selling music that glorifies the very stereotypes the game promotes. How can black people be outraged over a board game when black superstars have gotten rich by promoting those same stereotypes? These performers aren&rsquo;t boycotted. They are worshipped.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>NOTE: Ghettopoly was driven off the market, but Amazon.com has a used version for only $250.00:<br/>

		<p>Mr. Harris, the fact that you can name by sight these black &#8216;artists&rsquo; and indeed would turn on a television specifically to find a channel that plays their version of music, tells me you aren&rsquo;t as sophisticated as you would like to make us think.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
At the risk of making young black minds believe that foolishness is blackness, and at the cost of putting black women in an even worse position, they are recklessly releasing songs that promote the bad aspects of our culture. They go as far as to imply that if we don&rsquo;t take part in them, we&rsquo;re somehow not black.<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Or it could be selling to a level that is truth.  I think they call this &#8216;the urban market&rsquo;.  But what if the market is in fact genetic rather than cultural?  Or more bluntly, what if culture never rises above it&rsquo;s genetics?</p>
<p>Blue is a boys color, red a girls.  Boys like hard-physics things: cars, athletics, math.  Girls are more esoteric with higher social intelligence but less real world skills.</p>
<p>Do those assumptions seem silly to you?  But there is enough statistical truth in the stereotype that few people bother to question, when girl turns 13-14 her interests in science and math begin to falter.  Or when a boy tells his father that he wants to be a race car driver instead of a Nobel Laureate.</p>
<p>Why is it forbidden to assume that black culture has it&rsquo;s own _reality driven_ stereotypes and the mental associations to match?</p>
<p>No white would ever be accused of being &#8216;too Jewish&rsquo; for having high IQ and a good study and work ethic, that much is true.  But if the only way blacks can acknowledge exceptionalism amongst their own is by comparing it to what they are innately jealous of, who are you to complain so long as the appelation is accurate?</p>
<p>Do you feel bad about making more money in a month than they do in six?</p>

<p>Stop right there.</p>
<p>Stereotypes exist and persist because they are true. Blacks DEMAND they be portrayed as identifiably black. Blacks used to refer to this as &#8216;keepin&rsquo; it real&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If the media presents a black who isn&rsquo;t portrayed as a stereotype, blacks reject the image and DEMAND that they be shown as who they really are (stereotypes).</p>
<p>This is yet another example of damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t.  </p>
<p>If Spike Lee tried to make a black film that didn&rsquo;t show blacks as they really are (racial black stereotypes), blacks wouldn&rsquo;t go to see it. Blacks want to see their stereotypes in the media, they just don&rsquo;t like white folk seeing them as they really are because the stereotype is who they are.<br/>

<p>Aren&rsquo;t those who accuse black achievers of not being &#8220;authentic&#8221; inadvertently revealing their true opinion of the IQ of their own racial kin? Of course they&rsquo;ve just been &#8220;trained&#8221; to think of themselves that way by our racist white society, I know.</p>

I find that hard to believe - whites usually go far out of their way to avoid race when around blacks, even black friends.  Maybe this guy&rsquo;s white friends were the exception and let the &#8220;snarky little race jokes&#8221; fly, but I&rsquo;m guessing he&rsquo;s just projecting because he&rsquo;s insecure.  <br/>

		<p>I guess Mr. Harris doesn&rsquo;t watch too much prime time TV on the over-the-air networks.  There, he would get a good dose of stereotyping as well   &mdash;   Black nuclear physicists and brain surgeons, and white murderers and slack-jawed bigots.  </p>
<p>As far as that goes, every episode of that new ABC crime drama Detroit 187 that I&rsquo;ve seen (and I&rsquo;ve only missed one) features at least one white murderer.  Often times, the only murderer of the week will be white, with various black do-badders &#8220;falsely accused&#8221; at some point during the hour.  Heck, last week, the main doer was an upper middle aged white woman who lived in a ritzy part of the city (didn&rsquo;t know Detroit had anything like that anymore), and one of the subordinate quasi-criminals was a white drug junkie, a young white man.</p>

		<p>As with Mr. Harris, and as someone who is half white and black, I had personally experienced many of the same reactions from the few blacks who attended school with me at the University of San Diego in the 90&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Though I was undoubtedly called a &#8220;sell-out&#8221; by many of the black students, and I was roundly criticized for never attending, much less joining, the &#8220;Black Student Union&#8221;, the truth of the matter was that I frankly didn&rsquo;t care at all what the other black students thought of me.</p>
<p>Most of the students who were black were there on a sports scholarship, in any case; I was not.  And from what I gathered, most of these students never completed all four years; every Fall semester the returnees seemed to be fewer and fewer.</p>
<p>I never had any trouble from my fellow classmates who were White; in fact, I would imagine, if anything, I was somewhat of an anomaly in their minds.  Besides that, I was a Pre-Vatican II Traditionalist Catholic, something very unusual, White or otherwise.  And unlike Mr. Harris, I never seemed to be the recipient of any snide remarks, largely I think because I didn&rsquo;t fit the stereotype.</p>
<p>My reaction even then when I was referred to as a &#8220;sell out&#8221; was that &#8220;I never bought in&#8221;.  I was there to learn, to study, to get out and excel.</p>
<p>In short, the people who demonstrate these attitudes are pretty much the losers of the world.  Instead of, God-forbid, working on bettering themselves and concentrating on their own shortcomings, they see their own lives for the paltry, shabby existence that it really is, and feel that attacking others somehow justifies their own failures.</p>
<p>If I could give Mr. Harris any advice, it would be to develop a thick-skin, toughen up, and just deal with it.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately what Tyree Harris stays is true.  But we should not forget that while millionaire rappers are promoting the most damaging stereotypes about black people and encouraging other blacks to live down to those stereotypes, the media masters who promote the rappers (very few of whom are black) are the ones most eager to portray conservative whites as wicked and evil racists.</p>

<p>Well I could be mean and say groups want to live with people who they look like and who they are like. Whites want to live with whites -the more intelligent the better. Turks want to live with Turks -the more they act Turkish, the better.</p>

What beauty? Unless you find intertribal warfare (in which prisoners are always either killed or sold into slavery), polygamy, misogyny, primitivism, and insane mysticism &#8220;beautiful&#8221;, there is nothing beautiful in African culture. And anything that is remotely good in black culture in the US is derivative of white culture.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, and the media&rsquo;s so hard on blacks in its portrayal of that race and so easy on whites. Like all those episodes of &#8220;Law and Order&#8221; where the perp is always a black man who kills a white man, even though everyone knows that whites commit half of all murders despite being only 15% of the population. Oh, wait, it&rsquo;s the other way around? I guess Tyree&rsquo;s just full of it.</p>

		<p>A culture that refers to women as b*tches and hoes should not be embraced by anyone. They glorify killing, robbing and rape, while flashing expensive jewelry and drive very expensive cars. If only young naive whites would really see it for what it truly is, instead of emulating it. One thing that I always found curious, why haven&rsquo;t the femi-nazis not attacked this culture??

Well, some have indicated that politics makes strange bedfellows (in more ways than one). In the case of victimization politics, it seems to be an iron rule. Blacks and Hispanics don&rsquo;t get along either, but while they&rsquo;re shooting each other, they can agree that the reason they&rsquo;re shooting each other is the Evil White Man. And they vote accordingly.</p>

		<p>The fact of the matter is Mr. Harris is a sellout to black culture and does try to &#8220;act white&#8221;.  The problem is that he agrees with the opinion of the same degenerate blacks he despises and thinks that &#8220;acting white&#8221; is a bad thing.  Someone call the whambulance. </p>

<p>I agree with you. This young man is a fine person. Those of you who are looking for excuses to criticize him have no credibility. Given the fact he is Black, it would not matter what he said. </p>
<p>You are not race realists. You are bigots.  </p>
