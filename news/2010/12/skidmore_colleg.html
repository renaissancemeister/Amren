<h1>Skidmore College Student Justin Tavarez Charged in Racial Attack</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kerry Burke and Barry Paddock, New York Daily News, December 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Justin Tavarez, 19, a sophomore at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, became incensed when the two men sat down near him at Compton&rsquo;s Restaurant in Saratoga Springs about 5:30 a.m. on Saturday, authorities said.</p>
<p>Three fellow Skidmore students  &mdash;  two of them from New York City  &mdash;  joined in the attack on the white man while his black dining companion was in the bathroom, police said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were expressing their displeasure at the two of them dining together,&#8221; said Lt. Gregory Veitch of the Saratoga Springs police. &#8220;They started making racially derogatory comments to both of them and that escalated into the attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Tavarez bashed the man with a plate, Tavarez&rsquo;s three friends punched and kicked the victim as he lay on the floor, police said.</p>
<p>The victim&rsquo;s friend and diner employees managed to pull away the attackers  &mdash;  all of whom were black or Latino  &mdash;  and police nabbed the students, authorities said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tavarez admitted the assault to police, the Albany Times Union reported. &#8220;Yeah, so I hit him with the plate .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fine, so what?&#8221; Tavarez told cops. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not like if he had the chance he wouldn&rsquo;t have hit me with a plate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tavarez&rsquo;s family claims he acted in self-defense.</p>

		<p>Just being with an ethnic person drew the attention of other ethnic persons, who attacked the man because he was white. Good for the other patrons who held the bad guys for the police. But there will be a next time. Eventually somebody, or somebody&rsquo;s child will be attacked, who will have some influence to wake up a lot of people. Until then it will be poor proles like this guy geting beat up for their white race. I am white and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s historically justified, like they teach in the schools, that if a white person is victimised then he must have done something to deserve it.</p>

		<p>Yup, here we go again.</p>
<p>Unprovoked attacks by non-whites(esp.) blacks against whites, seems quite common in those blue states of the north.</p>
<p>We can blame forty- plus years of liberal policies for this. The more polititians and institutions try to appease them, the more hostile and bold they become. Benevolence is interpreted as weakness and unleashes their predatory nature. </p>
<p>White flight as we&rsquo;ve come to identify with it, has it&rsquo;s genesis in the northeast and areas of the mid-west. This later served as an impetus for the rest of the nation,-white nation that is. </p>

		<p>Please tell me the white dude attempted to defend himself.  Or, are all white men - and women - total sissies/babies?  Of course, minorities are always sucker-punching or taking a victim by total surprise in one way or another.  They also tend to gang up on their victims.  The usual ratio is 4 to 1.</p>
<p>This is going to escalate even more during the next few years.  Then, when the government is totally incapable of protecting anyone (meaning their &#8220;treasured&#8221; minorities), whitey will start hitting back.  I look forward to that day.<br/>

		<p>Yet, the same crew who attacked the victims will learn in their humanities that Blacks cannot be racists, and only whites are racists, and blah, blah, blah.  Yet, they are so racist that they attack and show no remorse.  Will their university now have special meetings on anti-white racism in the minority community?  Of course not.  The anti-white racism is taught in classes, encouraged by guest speakers, and the violence may be encouraged by lack of university punishment of the minority perpetrators of violence.  The more educated they become, the more they hate whites.  This is a consequence of some of the institutional racism in the US - how universities teach hatred of white people.  &mdash;    &mdash;  -HM</p>

		<p>Skidmore is a very good school with a high price tag. I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Tavarez earned his entrance per their very demanding standars (or possibly, just possibly per Affirmative Action and lower standars for Wise Latinos such as he).</p>

<p>Never mind, this about says it all-</p>
<p>&gt;<br/>
Tavarez&rsquo;s family claims he acted in self-defense.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know my son is not a racist,&#8221; said Tavarez&rsquo;s mother, Judy Cabrera, 42. &#8220;He&rsquo;s trying to better himself and get a good education.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our best friends are black and white,&#8221; she added. &#8220;We&rsquo;re all mixed. We&rsquo;re Hispanic.&#8221;<br/>
&gt;</p>
<p>When blacks and hispanics gang up on whites -together-, because this country is taking the long dive and the handouts and sympathy just stop coming, we will be in serious trouble.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate the ability of thugs to find common cause in a sense of dispossession from entitlements their parents told them would be theirs&rsquo; for the having.</p>

		<p>This is news? <br/>
Remember the Jena 6? <br/>
Anyone else ever go to a majority school of &ldquo;minorities&rdquo;? <br/>
Headline for an instant only. No follow-up coverage when the aggressors get no or nominal punishment. <br/>
This routine goes on all the time. <br/>

		<p>this happened in my neck of the woods. When I first heard the story on my way to work, no races were mentioned. The media drones called it a &#8216;bias attack&rsquo;. <br/>
It was not until later when the names of the perps were read out on the news that I learned the criminals were black and hispanic. <br/>
The funny thing is, when the perky news girl started interviewing people on the streets of Saratoga, she asks questions of two politically correct White guys! <br/>

I go to a school that&rsquo;s 70 percent minority but has test scores that AVERAGE in the 97th percentile and virtually no discipline problems- 1 suspension in the past 10 years and NEVER any incidence of violence on campus.</p>
<p>I know many people don&rsquo;t believe me so I&rsquo;ll provide the name of the school for you to google the facts.</p>
<p>Monta Vista High School, Cupertino, CA</p>
<p>Yep- 70 percent minority-<br/>
once you google it, you&rsquo;ll find out WHAT exactly separates us from other &#8220;minority schools&#8221;&hellip;..</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have to &#8220;google&#8221; anything to know what &#8220;sepatates&#8221; you from the other &#8220;minority schools.&#8221; Your school is a majority asian, with very few if any blacks or hispanic gangbanging illegals to bring down test scores.</p>
