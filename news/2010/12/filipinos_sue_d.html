<h1>Filipinos Sue Delano Hospital Over English-Only Rule</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Taxin, KBAK-TV (Bakersfield), Dec. 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dozens of Filipino hospital workers in California sued their employer Tuesday alleging they were the sole ethnic group targeted by a rule requiring them to speak only English.</p>
<p>The group of 52 nurses and medical staff filed a complaint accusing Delano Regional Medical Center of banning them from speaking Tagalog and other Filipino languages while letting other workers speak Spanish and Hindi.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Filipino workers said they were called to a special meeting in August 2006 where they were warned not to speak Tagalog and told surveillance cameras would be installed, if necessary, to monitor them. Since then, workers said they were told on a daily basis by fellow staffers to speak only English, even on breaks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In its lawsuit, the EEOC has accused the hospital in California&rsquo;s San Joaquin Valley of creating a hostile working environment for Filipinos by singling them out for reprimands and for encouraging other staff to report them. The agency is seeking an injunction to protect the workers against future discrimination.</p>
<p>The EEOC has seen an increase in complaints alleging discrimination based on national origin amid a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment, said Anna Park, a regional attorney for the EEOC. That&rsquo;s especially the case in California&rsquo;s central valley, where a greater share of the complaints the agency receives relate to such issues than in the nation as a whole.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under California law, employers may require workers to speak English if there is a business necessity, Su said.</p>
<p>Delano Regional Medical Center is a 156-bed hospital located about 30 miles north of Bakersfield.<br>

		<p>Regarding this story I do know that Filipinos are very prominent in the health field. It does seem unfair if Spanish and Hindi are allowed but Tagalog not. <br>
What I do know from personal experience is that the speaking of &#8220;diverse&#8221; languages in a place of employment in the United States of America IS a seed of discord and Disunity. Where I work some workers will have a little meeting with their friends, very nearby other co-workers during work hours and gab in their homeland language be it Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, etc. This most certainly is a cause of consternation, well especially amongst white people like me who can only speak English for the most part. It just makes you wonder-What are they giggling about? Are they sharing valuable career information? <br>
Finally, as someone who has ancestors who were non-English speaking, let us be Immigration Realists. I once took an Undergraduate American History wherein we looked into the 1924 Immigration Act. The left wing professor had us read dissent from people against who had names like Laguardia, Shannon, Rosenstein, and Wojcio. I hate to say it but most likely it was a good thing we put a halt to immigration at that time. We did need time for people to coalesce as a people. And I realize at least that that wave of immigration did not get Affirmative Action, SBA loans or other perks. They were probably greeted with ethnic slurs and had no recourse to some bogus politically correct lawsuit. <br>
We really need an Immigration Moratorium. Lets not just squawk about Illegal Immigration, that is only the most egregious. In time we could always modify Immigration Laws and hopefully the law will at least include no free lunch for recent immigrants. <br>

		<p>The irony is that almost all Filipinos speak English. My sense if that Filipinos in California are more liberal than the ones around DC. Perhaps because of greater numbers out there they organize by race.</p>
<p>But the bottom line is that more and more political disputes in California (and eventually the majority of the U.S.)will be between non-whites while whites just look on passively and foot the bill through increased taxes.</p>

		<p>I agree that the Filipinos should speak English if they work in a facility in the U.S., but on the other hand the Indians and Mexicans should also speak English only on the job! In that respect the lawsuit is justified if their is a double-standard regarding favored minorities.</p>

		<p>Reading back this article it is easy to see what happened in 2010 USA.</p>
<p>The Indians occupied the upper echelon of Hospital hierarchy-Doctors, educated support staff such as X Ray Tech.</p>
<p>As for Spanish speakers they occupied the lower mass of employees, and they can speak whatever they want.</p>
<p>The Filipinos occupied that middle level-Nurses, Nurse Aids, etc, either with more proximity to patients or less occupational clout.<br>

<p>Both sides of my family came from that wave of immigration. Neither suffered any major racial slurs or discrimination. Indeed, the Irish and Italians back then could give as good as they got (at the very least).</p>
<p>I can still remember a few mostly Irish and Italian neighborhoods when I was growing up in the northeast. They are probably all gone now but those white ethnic types were much more likely to fight back against black aggression than more assimilated whites.</p>

		<p>Well folks, all you white european descent persons now probably getting on in years.</p>
<p>As you get older you may require the services of a medical facility.</p>
<p>Just think how nice it is when you are laying in your bed in a not real healthy state and the cleaners, nurses, food services, etc are all speaking in a foreign language.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago they were all english speaking and shared some sense of compasion for those bed ridden.</p>
<p>Those days are over my friends.</p>

		<p>My wife was a cardiac nurse in California.  We left after two years there.  She stated that of all the ethnic groups in the hospital, the Filipinos were the laziest, most troublesome, and most clique-ish.  Nobody liked them much to work with them.  As an additional insight, while In Saudi during desert storm, I talked with many Saudis about their immigrant labor.  Next to blacks, they consistently said Filipinos were the most lazy, and deported them all, importing instead people from India who generally were polite, respectful, and hard working.  The second illustration is mentioned to show that my wife&rsquo;s opinion is shared by an entire country - it&rsquo;s not just her opinion alone.</p>

		<p>The irony is that in most cases, the grandparents or great grandparents of these Filipino workers were American citizens. Many of their ancestors fought against the Japanese. Someone I knew here in Tuscaloosa (he died recently)survived the Bataan Death March. He says he would not have made it if kind Filipinos had not helped him. He also witnessed a pregnant Filipino woman being disemboweled by Japanese bayonets for giving an American soldier a drink of water.</p>
<p>I have always thought highly of the Filipinos I have met in my life. If they want to speak Tagalog, then let them!  But you can be sure they speak good English too!</p>

		<p>Poster #6 is so right.  I have witnessed this and experienced it firsthand.  I&rsquo;m not a senior citizen or anywhere close to that yet, but I am so dreading having the Haitian nursing attendant, Chinese doctor and Latino nurse etc.</p>
<p>I have been to med centers from time to time for routine things, and in the last 15 years it&rsquo;s like ALL the white staff has disappeared from this city!  They&rsquo;re just gone!</p>
<p>I recently had a Chinese doc - couldn&rsquo;t speak English hardly at all and had about as much bedside manner as a snail.  I have a &gt;Latina tooth cleaner who is like the dentist from hell.  My in-law was admitted recently to a hospital for some tests, and all the staff were incompetent (all non-white) save for one elderly white nurse who was fantastic, and she opened up to us that the hospital wanted to can her because she spent too much time with the patients.</p>
<p>What will it be like in 30 years when I need services?  I shudder.  Already, every old lady you see around here is accompanied by a black (Haitian or Jamaican) &#8216;nurse&rsquo; attendant who pushes them down the street in their wheelchairs.  The white women look so sad, and the black attendants look so disinterested and even haughty.  Imagine your companion in your needy, twilight years is a low IQ black who hates you.</p>

<p>PLEASE!!! do not base an opinion on or of anything relative to what the disgusting Saudis think of anything. The problem with Filipinos in Saudi is that they (and anyone else not Saudi) is treated as less than human, which is of course, proper for a muslim) The passports are confiscated, their pay is NEVER what is advertised when they are hired, they are &#8220;loaned&#8221; money to tide them over till payday and the loan begins to accrue interest (which is unlawful under islam but ok for muslims to charge non muslims) and then a HUGE monetary lean is pressed against the passport which may result in prison time if the person tries to leave without paying the lean which is several YEARS of labor with no pay and little food. NO Sir, do not judge anything by a Saudis&rsquo; opinion. This same thing happens to these same people in Kuwait too.</p>

		<p>To poster #10, it is forbidden for muslims to accept or charge interest to both muslims and non-muslims, so the saudis charging interest at all makes them double hypocrites.  </p>
<p>I just wonder why filipinos and others even bother to go such places, especially now after abuses there are so widely known.</p>

<p>That is absolutely true!   I see exactly the same thing in my own neighborhood. The attendants seem to be mostly West Indians.  (Additionally, they have access to the building, which makes me a little uncomfortable, as we have no blacks here otherwise, nor in the neighborhood. How do you know who their relatives or friends are?  Whom they could let in?)    </p>
<p>Very rarely, I see an occasional old man (with attendant),  but almost all of the elderly are old ladies   &mdash;    by far.   I guess most of the old fellas have died off by then, while the women live on and on, indestructibly.  The old women (and  some old men) not only look very sad, they are silent, and most of them do not seem to communicate at all with their handlers who appear to be totally disinterested and bored.   </p>
<p>In fairness,  I must say that I have seen a few attendants who did appear concerned and kindly;  but most of them are just killing time doing  &#8220;a job&#8221; they hate.  One has to wonder how they bully and shove around their helpless,  elderly charges when they are indoors and out of sight of the public  (and even steal from them, as I have occasionally read in the newspapers).   Indeed, it is very sad.   What a future to have to face!  </p>
