<h1>Crystal Mangum Freed After Jury Deadlocks</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse James Deconto, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), December 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Crystal Mangum, the accuser in the Duke lacrosse rape case, is free and will be reunited with her children after a jury deadlocked on the most serious charge she faced from a domestic incident this year.</p>
<p>Superior Court Judge Abe Jones sentenced Mangum to 88 days in jail  &mdash;  time she already served awaiting trial.</p>
<p>A 12-member jury found Mangum guilty of child abuse, injury to personal property and resisting a public officer, all misdemeanors. Under state sentencing guidelines, 90 days was the maximum sentence Jones could have ordered, but he decided she&rsquo;d paid enough for her crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Questions the jury asked Jones during deliberations suggest the three dissenting jurors thought she was reckless in setting fire to a pile of her boyfriend&rsquo;s clothing in their bathtub. That fire was set while Mangum&rsquo;s three children and two police officers were in the apartment.</p>
<p>On the way out of the courtroom Friday, Mangum declined to talk to reporters. Supporter Victoria Peterson reiterated a claim by the Friends of Crystal Mangum that authorities were punishing Mangum for accusing Duke lacrosse players of rape in 2006. Mangum was retaliating against her boyfriend, Milton Walker, for allegedly punching her in the face; Walker was never charged.</p>

		<p>How much time will the 88 Marxist Academics who condemned<br>
the Lacrosse players as white rapist racists serve? Will<br>
they ever be held accountable for the destruction they <br>
committed? Of course not they will rise to the highest <br>
ranks of the Academic ladder like the good little Soviet<br>

Clearly this woman&rsquo;s life was devastated after she was &#8216;raped&rsquo; by those white Duke boys. </p>

		<p>This member of the criminal black underclass will continue her anti-social, lawless actions for as long as she is able.  There are millions more just like her, but we hear of her antics merely because she made herself infamous.  Nothing about her notoriety caused her to set a fire or be arrested.</p>

<p>Debra, did you read any of the &#8220;evidence&#8221; used against the boys? I have a feeling your head is firmy planted up your arse.</p>
<p>This hooker filed these accusations because she was thrown out by frat boys who did not want ghetto entertainment.</p>

		<p>She should hook up with Rodney King, who has also had a get out of jail for free card since his infamous run in with the L.A.P.D.<br>
The one thing that continues to amaze me is that O.J. Simpson is actually locked up, even if not for the right reason.</p>

		<p>No suprises here; after getting a free pass on felony obstruction of justice, a free pass on arson is par for the course.</p>
<p>The good news is that since she has been given no reason whatever to alter her behavior, she&rsquo;ll eventually die of a drug overdose.  This is what we call a &#8220;self-correcting problem&#8221;.  Piling her boyfriend&rsquo;s clothes in an apartment bathtub and setting them on fire is obviously the work of a crazy person, and crazy people usually self-medicate, which is head-shrinker code for &#8220;using hard drugs&#8221;.</p>
<p>My suspicion about the &#8220;rape&#8221; hoax was that she did not merely file the complaint because the lacrosse players tossed her out because of disgust at &#8220;ghetto entertainment&#8221;, Bobster.  I think she was also outraged and jealous at the notion of young white men from good families getting college degrees at a prestigious university so they could make something of themselves.  Here were whites - male ones at that - who were actually going somewhere in life, and she simply couldn&rsquo;t stand it.</p>
