<h1>Strip Club Owner Posts &#8220;No Negroes Allowed&#8221; Sign</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charles Ray, KSHB-TV (Kansas City), December 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A sign excluding black people from a future Abbotsford, Wisconsin business is enraging some people in the small town.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sign generations of people may have never seen, yet Mark Prior says it&rsquo;s his right to discriminate.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&rsquo;ve got a problem with you it&rsquo;s going to be on the front of my store,&#8221; says Mark Prior.</p>
<p>Prior posted his &#8216;No Negros Allowed&rsquo; sign after he says he had some problems with black people in the past and needed to make a policy against them.</p>
<p>Federal and State law says if the business is open to the public, prohibiting people based on race is illegal. If the man&rsquo;s proposed gentlemen&rsquo;s club was going to be a private club, then an African American historian says he could discriminate.</p>
<p>Legalities aside, his is a sign that many say is appalling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m going to stick to my guns because I think I have the right as a business owner to reject service to anyone, [he says.]&#8221; {snip}</p>

		<p>I think the law will come down against this smart man since if your business is open to the public you have to admit everyone who has the admission fee- regardless of the common sign &#8220;we reserve the right to refuse service&#8221;. I think the best thing for him and his business would be to become a private club and limit memberships to non-blacks.</p>

<p><br>
If an Historian, and an African American one at that, says a private club can discriminate, then I guess it&rsquo;s all right. </p>
<p>Maybe the owner can put up a sign that says &#8220;No welfare recipients,&#8221; or &#8220;No big nostrils,&#8221; or &#8220;No Affirmative action qualifiers,&#8221; or &#8220;No one below 85 IQ,&#8221; or &#8220;No fried chicken breath,&#8221; or some other non racial statement. </p>
<p>Of course if it said &#8220;No whites&#8221; there wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.</p>

		<p>Hmmm, so Freedom of Association is dead as we all knew anyway. My only question is where the article about black businesses in L.A. and surrounding areas of Oakland and San Fran where Whites are told to leave the store? Been there, done that. Don&rsquo;t believe the Justice Department is interested in pursuing the issue as long as Whites are involved.</p>

		<p> Senator-elect Rand Paul of Kentucky would agree with Mr. Prior. He said in an interview several months ago that he believes the 1964 Civil Rights Act only guarantees access to all entering public facilities   &mdash;   not privately-owned ones. The news media, led by the Louisville Courier-Journal, did a Ubangi stomp all over Paul for saying such a &#8220;verboten&#8221; thing, but he won the seat anyway.</p>
<p> Notice how the TV news crew hunted up a black professor to try to refute Prior&rsquo;s claim (and speak condescendingly of him into the bargain), but apparently made no effort to find anyone who might suggest that he is right. That&rsquo;s called &#8220;press bias.&#8221;</p>

		<p>We need to get back to freedom of association. This guy has the right idea, but in our world of scared Whites I think his straightforwardness might cause him problems.</p>
<p>I believe he could reach the desired effect with a sign like one I saw on the front door of a biker bar outside Macon, GA. It read:  The government prohibits us from denying service to Blacks (they didn&rsquo;t say &#8220;Blacks&#8221;), but be advised that our other customers might stab or shoot you if you come in here.</p>
<p>Thirsty non-local Blacks were occasionally attracted by the Ice House sign out front, but they always decided to buy one someplace else after they read the safety advisory on the door.</p>

		<p>I worked in the strip club business for almost 20 years. The clubs in my area that had the biggest problems e.g. drugs, robberies, car break-ins, fights, shootings, murders, etc., were those located in urban areas and/or catered to blacks (and hispanics). Having black and hispanic dancers is okay  &mdash;  as long as the vast majority of your customers are White. One plus of having black dancers is when you have to throw out a black patron (usually a drug dealer) and they try to sue for discrimination. The NAACP comes in, sees the black employee(s) and drops the case. To further keep out the &#8220;urban&#8221; clientele, clubs I worked for (1) charged a cover charge, (2) enforced a dress code, (3) didn&rsquo;t stock liquors like Alize and Hypnotiq (dropping Hennessy, Heineken and Tangueray would&rsquo;ve been a good move too), and (4) played LOTS of rock music like Lynyrd Skynyrd, Metallica, etc., and little rap/hip-hop. </p>

I walked up and told him he needed to leave. &#8220;But I haven`t done anything yet!!&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;True enough,&#8221; I responded. &#8220;But I know your going to Mess up before you know your going to.&#8221; Surprisingly, he didn`t have an answer to that one and quietly left the premises&hellip;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right as far as it goes literally, but governments do everything they can and reach to insane lengths to construe a business as being &#8220;open to the public,&#8221; and the Feds do the same for the sake of &#8220;interstate commerce&#8221; so that state and Federal civil rights laws apply to them.  If that fails, then some politician will slander the club as not really &#8220;private.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the late 1960s or early 1970s, a subdivision in Kansas City, Missouri was trying to resist forced racial integration.  So it decided to incorporate as a country club, build a pool as a &#8220;benefit,&#8221; and charge a low yearly club membership fee of $10.  The Attorney General of Missouri at the time, someone you have probably heard of, John Danforth, sued the residents using what were recently passed state civil rights laws.  The fundamental basis of his case against the country club was that $10 a year was too low for a real country club.  (Danforth should know a thing or three about country clubs, BTW.)  I can&rsquo;t remember the outcome of the case, but within several years, other pressures forced residents to move away, so the &#8220;country club&#8221; became moot.  But that stupid quote of Danforth&rsquo;s was used against him in his first U.S. Senate race, and it worked to keep him from winning.  But by the time of his second try, all that was unfortunately forgotten, and he won.  After Danforth left the Senate after three terms, he served as a head of a 1999 Waco panel/investigation that turned out to be a big cover up (the chief architect of the cover-up was just elected Missouri Auditor), and a few years later, Bush 43 made him his first UN Ambassador.</p>

		<p>What he could do is to claim that the strip club is a private club and charge &#8220;membership dues&#8221; to patrons. Even the late Tupac Shakur was persona non grata at a Atlanta Black strip club after several incidences with him and or his entourage touching the dancers and supposidly one dancer left the club with him even though she denied it.</p>

		<p>If this business owner is forced to admit blacks, then the Congressional Black Caucus should be forced to admit whites.  If a private business cannot discriminate, how much more so a political organization.  But somehow I doubt this double standard will be brought up in court.</p>

		<p>The sign seems harsh to our modern sensibilities, but in a free market economy, a business owner should indeed have the right to choose who he will and will not serve. If such a policy leaves an opening for the club across the street to admit blacks (if it wants to assume that risk) and undercut its competitor&rsquo;s market, a move which may allow it to capture the untapped niche and possibly drive it&rsquo;s competitor out of business, then that&rsquo;s how the free market is supposed to work! It is only our current communist system that forbids this type of free enterprise. </p>
<p>And by the way, organizations like the NAACP can and do exclude whites as they see fit, and nobody seems to care or notice.</p>

		<p>I agree that he should turn it into a private club. There&rsquo;s a private bar not far from where I live. Before it became private, my husband and I went in one night for a drink. It was a nice place, had some pool tables and civilized patrons. Nothing fancy, sort of like a little neighborhood bar, but nice. </p>
<p>We went back some time later in the afternoon and it was closed, but had a sign saying it was a private club. A man was coming out, I think he was the manager, and we asked him how we could join. He said all we had to do was walk in and say we wanted to become members. The fee was nominal, like $20/year.  </p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s done, folks.   </p>

		<p>(g) In my bar days there was a standard saying:&#8221;There are two things I cannot abide: One is racism and the other a [racial slur] in my joint&#8221;.<br>
But seriously: Were I to open a &#8220;Whites only&#8221; restaurant I could serve way overcharged dog [obscenity] and still be booked out two years in advance - and they know it. So I do not think they can allow this one to stand. They are going to throw everything including the kitchen sink his way. Though, with enough support this might become an interesting precedent.</p>

In South-Africa this is of cardinal importance. We have private holiday resorts; strip clubs; everything i.e. (parallel society) not open to the &ldquo;public&rdquo;. You can apply for a membership card, everything is membership based. They look at you and give you a membership card at a nominal fee, or they look at you and they don&rsquo;t. Some people call it discrimination, I call it art.<br>

		<p>Whites are prohibited from relying on their personal experience regarding blacks.  Whites are required to submit to the government&rsquo;s policy of treating blacks the same as whites, even though blacks are not the same as whites, and everyone knows it.  The emperor has no clothes, but it is illegal to act on that fact, so you&rsquo;ll have to pretend that he does, just as everyone else is forced to do, or be punished for acting on the truth.</p>

		<p>A private club can discriminate any way it wants.  WV used to allow liquor by the drink only in state licensed &#8220;private clubs&#8221;.  All anyone had to do was pay a small fee at the door for &#8220;membership&#8221;, and anyone could be denied that.  <br>
The U.S. still has freedom of speech, and no one can be legally stopped from using racial epithets.  A lot of people are fed up to the gills with PC and forced association.  If I understand correctly, Rand Paul believes any enterprise should be able to racially discriminate as long as public monies are not involved.  As it is, any enterprise with a private membership, no matter how transitory, is exempted from laws regarding racial discrimination.</p>

<p>Jack replies:</p>
<p>Music is extremely important in all situations. As long as you/we control the music - not allowing any low life hip hop/rap music, the Blacks know who is in charge and behave accordingly. And it doesn&rsquo;t have to just be White classic rock - if you go the extra mile to find, play very good Black R&B; music, blues music, soul music from the early 1970s it&rsquo;s still music/Stuff White People Like.</p>
<p>Older, more responsible Blacks will appreciate you finding, acknowledging very good Black music from 30 years ago and low life young Blacks feel left out that they don&rsquo;t even know about this music and can&rsquo;t appreciate it, same as they couldn&rsquo;t appreciate some classical music performance. When it&rsquo;s your music, low life young Blacks will either behave or leave.</p>

		<p>If the feminists really cared about the welfare of women they would support this businessman. The fact is blacks are more likely to grope or attack the strippers, keeping blacks out would go a long way towards ensuring the safety of the strippers. Suppose a stripper refuses to perform lap dances on black men, could she be sued as well? Where are the feminists who claim to champion the freedom of choice?</p>

		<p>Blacks have problems in strip clubs. The dancers avoid them because they are lousy tippers. Then the blacks get angry because the girls ignore them, then they get thrown out, and the cycle of violence continues.</p>
<p>   To avoid this I recommend playing rock music with some old R&B-; in case they complain of &#8220;Discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>   Some communities will ban booze if there is total nudity in the bars. Go to these places. Non-whites seem to need to be drunk to look at naked women.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a long time Harley biker and strippers like bikers. However, I have noticed in my long time strip club association that some of the stOOpid strippers insist on playing the gangsta rap music to dance to and then complain that the blacks give them a hard time! I say stop ALL gangsta music in clubs and get rid of DJs that insist on playing it, never mind what the dancers want and strippers that insist on gangsta music can go work at black strip joints and see how the tips fare there. Most Harley biker strip clubs make it known that blacks are not welcome and their usual conduct is not tolerated FOR LONG! so they seldom come to those places.</p>

		<p>Years ago I had a part-time job working in the evenings for a telephone marketing firm doing phone surveys.  For a brief time a young &#8216;lady&rsquo; sat next to me.  She was half-black/half-Latina and told me she usually worked as a stripper.  She was working there because she was &#8220;between jobs&#8221;.</p>
<p>One day, out of the blue, she told me was looking for a new job in a strip joint but was having difficulty finding one that catered to an exclusively White clientele.  She said she preferred dancing for White men over black or Latino men.  Though I already knew the reason, I asked her why.  These were her exact words:</p>
<p>&#8220;Because White men like to look; black and Spanish men have to TOUCH!&#8221;</p>
<p>Enough said.</p>

		<p>Strip Club Owner Posts &ldquo;No Negroes Allowed&rdquo; Sign, KSHB-TV (Kansas City); </p>
<p>Businessman seems to think he lives in a free country. </p>
<p>Thanks for the above (comment at the end). Made me smile if nothing else. Reminded me. In England, during the 1950s, a few boarding houses, probably not more than a handful were found to have similar signs up:  No Blacks - No Irish. No Dogs. I think the latter two were a canny attempt to get around the &#8216;prejudice&rsquo; thing  (a lot of white people in this country, even back  then were afraid of seeming racist - or &#8216;colour prejudiced &rsquo; as it was commonly known in those days). Anyway, these boarding houses were very few and very far between as to be almost non existent, but it&rsquo;s not stopped the liberal establishment and it toadying media from dragging  up this particularly piece - often headlined as - &#8216;a shameful episode in our history - every chance it gets as if it were an everyday happening. But it certainly wasnt  because my mother ran one of those boarding houses in a street full of other boarding houses and part of a town where blacks were being settled at this time (Harlesden, nowadays a yardy enclave in west London full of violent gun crime and  drug wars).  What&rsquo;s more, she couldnt even remember ever seeing any of these  &#8216;No Blacks Allowed&rsquo; signs. Though she did remember hearing about some young black children putting lumps of  dog excreta through an old lady&rsquo;s letterbox in a few streets down.</p>

		<p>&#8220;White strippers are like the bottom of the stripper barrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Funny, this coming from a black man, considering that the white strippers are probably the main reason that any black men go to strip clubs.</p>

		<p>This is so irrelevant, it&rsquo;s almost funny.<br>
I mean, you might as well post a sign in Florida saying, &#8220;No Eskimos allowed.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty good at geography, but never heard of Abbotsford, Wisc. So I looked it up.  It has a population that is 98.57 white, and only 0.15% black.  It&rsquo;s in Clark county, which is only 0.13% black.    </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re likely to be having any problems with blacks.  What blacks?</p>
<p>Now, it would be another thing if he put up his sign in Baltimore, Detroit, or East St. Louis!  That would take courage.</p>

<p>In Blackspeak, the more names they have, the more important the person. We&rsquo;re supposed to be duly impressed.</p>
<p>Just like  &#8220;The Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Junior&#8221;.   Would anybody pay attention to Martin King?</p>
