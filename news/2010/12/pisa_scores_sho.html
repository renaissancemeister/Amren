<h1>PISA Scores Show Demography Is Destiny In Education Too  &mdash;  But Washington Doesn&rsquo;t Want You to Know</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Sailer, VDARE, December 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Every three years, the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], the rich country&rsquo;s club, announces the results of its Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). These are tests of school achievement for 15-year-olds in the 34 OECD countries, plus 31 other countries or regions. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It took me two days of looking through the voluminous PISA results to create the simple graph below. It shows what the Great and Good don&rsquo;t want you to know about the 2009 PISA results: When broken down by ethnicity, American students did reasonably well compared to the countries from which their ancestors came. </p>
<p>In this chart, I&rsquo;ve depicted American ethnic groups in red to show where they fall relative to other countries, which are colored to reflect their dominant populations.</p>
<p>As my chart shows:</p>
<p>* Asian Americans outscored every Asian country, and lost out only to the city of Shanghai, China&rsquo;s financial capital.</p>
<p>* White Americans students outperformed the national average in every one of the 37 historically white countries tested, except Finland (which is, perhaps not coincidentally, an immigration restrictionist nation where whites make up about 99 percent of the population). </p>
<p>* Hispanic Americans beat all eight Latin American countries. </p>
<p>* African Americans would likely have outscored any sub-Saharan country, if any had bothered to compete. {snip}</p>
<p>PISA test scores are allotted in roughly the same fashion as for the SAT. The mean for the 34 OECD First World countries was originally set at 500, with a standard deviation of 100. The PISA test was also given in 31 other places, mostly poorer countries, most of which score well under 500. {snip}<br>
[See] my bar chart [below] of American scores by ethnicity. Interestingly, American Hispanics did significantly better in reading in 2009 than they had done in science in 2006 and in math in 2003. </p>
<p>Why does my second graph have to compare reading scores from 2009 to science scores from 2006 and math scores from 2003? </p>
<p>Because PISA and the U.S. government apparently conspire to keep the ethnic breakdowns of American scores a secret, except for whichever subject is the main theme of that year&rsquo;s PISA (reading in 2009, science in 2006, and math in 2003). Thus the only American scores broken down by ethnicity yet released for 2009 were for reading. </p>
<p>Yet all three subjects are tested each year, and scores for all subjects are released in mind-numbing detail cross-tabbed for every conceivable factor .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. except race.</p>
<p>Considering the hundreds of pages of data PISA releases on its website on all three tests for 2009, it&rsquo;s ludicrous (yet unsurprising) that PISA won&rsquo;t publish the ethnic breakdowns it has collected. The words &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; or &#8220;Latino&#8221; don&rsquo;t appear anywhere in the otherwise endless PISA 2009 data. </p>
<p>Instead, PISA conveyed the ethnic data confidentially to the U.S. government  &mdash;  which then released the racial breakdowns for just the reading test on its National Center for Educational Statistics website (PDF). </p>
<p>The goal of this byzantine process is evidently to make it more inconvenient for crass outsiders and possible critics to grasp the patterns underlying the scores.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A few caveats about the strong performance of the U.S.:</p>
<p>First: in 2009, the U.S. did slightly better in reading than in science, and moderately better in science than in math. So, my top graph, showing the 2009 reading results, puts America&rsquo;s best foot forward in what ought to be a three-legged race. But of course I can&rsquo;t show you PISA scores by ethnicity for 2009 in science and math because they are, apparently, federal secrets.</p>
<p>Second: my top chart does not offer a true apples-to-apples comparison of whites in America to whites in other traditionally white countries. For example, New Zealand whites scored 541 on reading in 2009, 16 points above American whites. But the Kiwis&rsquo; national scores are dragged down somewhat by the indigenous Maori and by Pacific Islander immigrants, who do more for the current competitiveness of New Zealand&rsquo;s national rugby team than for the future competitiveness of its 21st Century economy. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Third: America pays royally for the results we do get. We spend more per student than any country in the world, other than Luxembourg, a small, rich tax haven. We spend about fifty percent more per student than Finland does.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An important question remains: How much can we trust the PISA results? </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the fact that Northeast Asians tend to be smarter than Latin Americans is not the kind of thing you are supposed to discuss in the American MSM. It&rsquo;s considered both too obvious and too irresponsible to mention. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before reading too much into detailed results, here are some inherent problems with this kind of international testing that should borne in mind.</p>
<p>First: although the PISA officials worked hard to come up with representative samples of 15-year-old students in representative samples of schools, not all 15-year-olds are students. So, in countries with a high dropout rate, scores artificially boosted because the unstudious are not tested. {snip}</p>
<p>(Similarly, the overall ethnic gaps within the U.S. are larger than those shown in my second chart because of higher dropout rates among Hispanics and blacks.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Second: Might administrators cheat? {snip} We can&rsquo;t know for sure.</p>
<p>Third: how motivated students are to work hard on the test is a significant imponderable. Administrators and teachers are supposed to motivate the students, but not threaten them. So, at least in theory, PISA is a low-stakes test for students. Doing badly on it isn&rsquo;t supposed to hurt them. Which means the temptation to slack off and &#8220;bubble in&#8221; some of the answers is always there. </p>

		<p>Thank you for that wonderful Christmas Present!!!!</p>
<p>After decades of hearing how inferior we American Whites are to Asians (and how lazy and spoiled we are), your bottom graph reveals that in the two categories where we are supposedly soooooooo inferior to them (Math &amp; Science), we actually lead.  </p>
<p>And this in a world where we Whites put far less pressure on our kids to achieve academically, and where the Asians (supposedly, anyway) relentlessly make their young buckle-down and study.</p>
<p>You cannot imagine how liberating that knowledge is for me.  </p>
<p>Thank you, AMREN!</p>

		<p>If it&rsquo;s true that white Americans and whites in other &#8220;historically&#8221; white countries are about on par academically, then I think I&rsquo;ve figured out perhaps one reason that the media keep telling us that American students are doing so poorly   &mdash;   To con us into thinking that we &#8220;need&#8221; those H-1B visa legal immigrants from Asia to &#8220;fill the jobs&#8221; that &#8220;Americans just are not smart enough to do.&#8221;  </p>

<p>Steve as usual is right on the money. The man is a genius in his own right.</p>
<p>And I have always suspected this. White American kids do very well, if just taken as a group, NOT including the Mexican and Bantu. If you add in the Bantu and Mexican kids with the white, then the white kids are just dragged down something terrible.</p>
<p>Shanghai [Chinese], Hong Kong [Chinese] and Singapore [Chinese] are not really representative either of a NATION! Small elites not really representative of the whole. You throw in the rest of the kids in China and you will see the scores plummet.</p>
<p>The U.S. educational system is sound. Do not thrown the baby out with the bath water. Some make it dirty, but not all.</p>

		<p>I look at this data. I look at several urban and suburban schools with many black middle class students. I look at behavior patterns, suspension-repeat grades-graduation rates. My conclusion-public schools are bad for everyone. Shut them all down. Give the parents tax rebates up to fifteen grand per year. If they don&rsquo;t want to spend it on education,i.e., private schools new or existing, fine. Get rid of compulsory ed laws. Get rid of dropout ages. If you don&rsquo;t want your kid to stay in school ever, fine. But no welfare for the fact he&rsquo;s home and you have to feed him. Get rid of the school feeding programs which are evolving into fulltime feeding of minority students. Get rid of admissions that can&rsquo;t discriminate for any reason. I.e., a black school wants to exclude whites and Asians fine, and vice-versa. Let the market decide. What do you think will happen? And except for national security research, get rid of all federal aid to colleges, and ban affirmative action of any sort, including race as &#8220;a&#8221; factor, since when it&rsquo;s used, it&rsquo;s always &#8220;the&#8221; factor. Shake all this up. You come up with qualtiy education. As for the millions who will drop out by eigth to tenth grade?  Just don&rsquo;t subsidize them. They&rsquo;ll either apprentice themselves out at low wages and learn useful work. Or they will rebel, steal, and die. A win win.</p>

		<p>Even IF it&rsquo;s true Asians are the pinnacle while blacks are at the bottom, this just shows that if you&rsquo;re black and develop study as a habit you can outperform Asians in Asia. </p>
<p>As a second note the reading scores of 15 year old Asians show that in 30 years, in a fair world, most of the journalists will be Asians. Diversicrats must love that idea. </p>

<p>Steve Sailer is mistaken about this. All Steve has to do to get to the USA ethnic group data on math and science testing is to go to this US Educ Dept run website-</p>

		<p>These tests seem very pointless to me. Blacks and Hispanics are more or less a tax, they contribute nothing and suck up vast quanititites of resources. However when it comes down to it, they really don&rsquo;t really matter. We don&rsquo;t need them and we more or less keep them penned up in ghettos and let them rot. Whites still churn out brilliant scientists and innovators and lead the world in ideas and cultural influence. Try to name the world&rsquo;s most famous Asian  &mdash;  after the Dali Lama, it is difficult to name anyone. </p>

		<p>America&rsquo;s current productivity and innovation remain good because the country is still wealthy and continues to attract the world&rsquo;s best and brightest to work here. However, this may not persist into the long term future. Education budgets are being slashed and catering more and more to the middle instead of advanced students.</p>
<p>What was surprising about the recent PISA scores was the emergence of Shanghai-China at #1 in all categories - and this was just their international debut. They didn&rsquo;t participate in previous PISA evaluations. This is symbolic of China&rsquo;s rise (much like the 2008 summer olympics), but there is another conclusion to draw. Namely the talent and strength that was once hidden away is starting to make itself known.</p>
<p>Even though China is still magnitudes financially poor per capita compared to the USA, there is reason to believe that they will eventually provide the next wave of human innovation. The combination of R&D; relocation to China plus China&rsquo;s own use of statistical certainty to find it&rsquo;s best people all but guarantee it. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time. They need more time.     </p>

Reading and writing are abstract concepts. Yes, you need to know spelling and grammar, but writing in general is subject to the examiners interpretations. Spelling requires a good memory, which most Asians have. Grammar requires some simple repetitive rules. Science and math on the other hand are concrete concepts. The results to math and science are not subjected to personal interpretations. The answer are either right or wrong regardless of where or who is interpreting the results.</p>
<p>I am happy to see confirmation that whites aren&rsquo;t the dumbest bipedal animals as claimed by so many liberal intellectuals. It is also nice to see whites succeeding even thought they are constantly being psychologically abused, by being told they are inferior, from the first day they attend school.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe Germany scored so low. It must be all that &#8220;diversity&#8221; they keep bringing into their country.</p>

		<p>Who administered the tests?  I&rsquo;d be skeptical of test results from any non-western country, since often the education systems in non-western countries are corrupt.   At Canadian universities there is a MUCH higher incidence of cheating among international students from China and the Islamic countries, than among native born Canadian students.  Many of them don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with cheating.  Some of them even try to bribe professors  &mdash;  apparently a common practice in some parts of the world. </p>

		<p>What is the wisdom behind including the capitol of Shanghai and  ex-colonies like Macau, Hong Kong and the separate nation of Taipei (Taiwan) as different entities?  If we were to just list Washington DC and Puerto Rico for the US we would come up with  altogether different results.  I&rsquo;m willing to bet we can find some cities in Northern Europe with higher scores than Shanghai.  Mainland China doesn&rsquo;t even make it on the graph.    </p>

		<p>Get rid of all races except whites and in six months we&rsquo;ll begin to colonize the stars; get rid of only the whites and in six months what peoples are left will enter into another Paleozoic Era, or better said: the first NON-PALE-ozoic Era.</p>
<p>Each time I hear it said that whites are inferior to Asians I think of this photograph I once saw. It was taken in late 1943, during WWII. In the foreground of the picture were many of these so-superior Chinese, sitting cross-legged on the ground beside a runway they were building. They were hammering away on big rocks, using fist-sized rocks, to make little rocks. In the background a B-29 Superfortress, the biggest and most technologically complicated machine ever devised by Man (up to that time), was coming in for a landing. Invented, built and crewed by whom? You guessed it: a bunch of dumb, white guys, THAT&rsquo;S WHOM!       </p>

		<p>Heard a liberal commentator on one of the cable talking head shows this morning state that our &#8220;poor&#8221; PISA standings &#8220;prove&#8221; why we need to spend more money on education.  The H-1B angle (see my post 5), now this, are probably the main two practical angles to censoring the racial data.  Other than that the ruling class doesn&rsquo;t want us to ponder racial differences.</p>

Let&rsquo;s see the overall picture. Orientals are not good at innovation.  They lack creativity which is genetic in nature.  Sure, they can copy something but they need to mine Western technology in order to do it.  <br>

<p>Imagine someone took a camera and went back in history to when Europe was in the Dark Ages. If they took a picture of Europeans there and then compared them to other more advanced Old World cultures existing at the time&hellip; people would have thought Whites to be inferior. Would it have been true? Clearly not. The chest-thumping present in your post does little but propagate a false sense of security. </p>
<p>Times have changed. Back in the 1940s, China had nothing and was quite literally stuck in the Middle Ages due to complacent and xenophobic attitudes. Today, just 3 generations later, they can rival the world&rsquo;s sole superpower, America. The US is still majority White, but young White kids today are growing up without the same wealth and without the same spirit that characterized the American heyday (which was relatively short). The same can be said for the largely stagnated EU. In light of all this, where&rsquo;s the room for racial self-glorification? While it might make some people feel better in the short-term, it&rsquo;s ultimately harmful since it fosters complacency. The Chinese have learned that lesson, and its positive results are shown daily. What about us?</p>
