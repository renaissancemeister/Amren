			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lindsey Seavert, WCCO-TV (Minneapolis), Dec. 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Minnesota immigration rights group is protesting what it calls &#8220;mass firings&#8221; of Chipotle workers. According to the group, around 50 of the restaurant&rsquo;s Latino workers have been fired in the last week.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Immigration Rights Action Committeee (MIRAC), a local group that fights for the legalization of undocumented workers, says employees at local Chipotle stores came forward, saying they were fired over questions about their immigration status.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started to piece together there was something larger going on than a few people fired at one store,&#8221; said MIRAC member Brad Sigal. &#8220;It appears to be a statewide attack on immigrant worker who are longtime employees most of them been working there for years.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sigal says he suspects it&rsquo;s the result of a federal immigration audit.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an I-9 audit,&#8221; said Sigal. &#8220;They check the paperwork and fire anyone who can&rsquo;t immediately prove they have the right to work. An action like this on a mass scale before the holidays is not consistent with the image they have cultivated.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement, Chipotle said, &#8220;We are fully cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in Minnesota in connection with a document request they have made.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Customers leaving Grand Avenue Chipotle offered conflicting views.</p>
<p>&#8220;I happen to be someone who is struggling to look for a job and I believe in fair practice,&#8221; said Tasha Scott, a St. Paul resident. &#8220;If I am eligible to work, and I have all the status and things required by law, I should have a job here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am an ethical vegan, I care about animals and humans,&#8221; said Melissa Swanson, a St. Paul resident who says she hopes she learns the truth. &#8220;If it doesn&rsquo;t fit my ethics, we won&rsquo;t be coming back.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This is a small taste of what is to come when we make E-Verify mandatory for all new and current workers in the US.  There won&rsquo;t be any people singled out for racism.  There won&rsquo;t be internment camps.  There won&rsquo;t be any mass protests or people to protest against.  Only, letters that say, &#8220;I am sorry but your social security number is impossible.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve tried for years to understand - perhaps if someone speaks slowly to me - why anyone or any group would rail against those who broke into our country being fired, jailed or deported. They don&rsquo;t belong here, they need to go home. It seems pretty simple to me. Eisenhower said go in the early 50s and they left. To let them stay turns this nation of laws into a lie. When the first illegal alien was allowed to stay, we ceased to be a country who upheld the rule of law.</p>

<p>Under this idea, a brutal murderer (like some ILLEGAL ALIENS ARE) that goes for years without getting caught should be free! BTW, what happens to all the SSN money collected that doesn&rsquo;t go into a legitimate account? with all the 30 million ILLEGAL ALIENS it MUST amount to quite a lot of slush funds for those politicians that know how to access it.</p>

=================================================================<br>
That was before La Raza and no less than several other influential ethno-centric groups gained a foothold in this country. This was before the hispanic caucus was formed, only to go on to sell out this country in order to promote their hispanic first agenda. This was before gerrymandering and certain members of Congress representing districts made almost entirely of illegal invaders - who are no doubt voting.</p>
<p>All of these factors have combined to create the current atmosphere in which it has become &#8220;controversial&#8221; to remove illegal invaders from this country. The more our government panders to them, the more emboldened they become. </p>
<p>So much for &ldquo;living in the shadows!&rdquo; <br>

		<p>I have tried to follow the debate on illegal immigrants in the USA. It is obviously a serious problem but it also seems that some elements of American business and agriculture encourage illegals, not to mention all the do-gooders who seem to want open borders.</p>
<p>BUT, what are American Labor Unions saying about all of this? I would really be interested to know. Surely it would be better for Afro Americans to be employed in jobs such as picking crops or driving taxies rather than have then on welfare or joining street gangs. Are the unions trying to do ANYTHING to keep jobs for Americans either Black and White?</p>
<p>Perhaps the government and the unions should get together and simply not allow illegals to work in the USA without a permit and deny them welfare, problem solved!</p>
<p>In Australia illegals do not get welfare or medicare benefits. Agriculture seems to work quite well with proper wages being paid to workers. However we do have too many do-gooders who still want open borders. (Thank goodness we are surrounded by sea and ocean.</p>

<p>&#8220;Undocumented workers&#8221; say they were fired over &#8220;questions&#8221; about their legal status? No, they weren&rsquo;t fired over any questions. They were fired because of the answers they provided, or chose not to provide. It&rsquo;s amazing the Orwellian language the Lamestream media uses, and then wonders why it&rsquo;s objectivity is called into question.</p>
<p>Mandatory employment verification, immigration audits, and fines for employing people illegally here is the best tool we have for fighting illegal immigration. If they can&rsquo;t get jobs, most of them won&rsquo;t come. No need to deport. No need for a date with an immigration court. No teray-eyed mothers screaming that they&rsquo;re being torn away from their families. They&rsquo;ll realize they have to leave, and no more will bother to come.</p>

		<p>Hopefully this is just the start of this being done in ALL work places across the U.S. Realistically we can&rsquo;t deport, let alone find, all the illegal immigrants, so this is the next best thing. They come into our country illegally, use forged work permits and social security cards, start breeding immediately so they can point at their anchor babies and cry &#8220;you can&rsquo;t deport us - he/she was born in the U.S.A.!&#8221; and think that qualifies them for U.S. citizenship. All the while a lot of them are working our system for food stamps and other benefits. This has to stop! No wonder this country is broke. And millions of our LEGAL citizens can&rsquo;t find work, but businesses in this country will employ illegals? I think hefty fines should be leveed against these businesses employing illegals. The fines could go into an account to fund the unemployment benefits of U.S. citizens. And the quicker we bar them from working here, the quicker they will have to leave and go back to wherever they came from. It can&rsquo;t be too soon.</p>

		<p>How can any American feel any sympathy for these interlopers? The jobs that they are doing used to be held by Americans. When I was young( I am 46 now) most retail and restaraunt jobs were held by high school kids. At this time it seems these jobs are held only by illegals.These people are not all bad but they need to go back to their native lands. We have a minimum 10% unemployment rate in this country and we need those jobs. If we could make these people leave millions of jobs would open up for our people. I am tired of the lie that they are just doing jobs that we won&rsquo;t do. I have worked in construction for 26 years and  and see a steady rise in the number of illegals doing the jobs that were done by Americans when I entered the trades. I am sure that just about anybody who works has also seen this trend.Many of the jobs that they are doing used to pay family supporting wages but those wages and benefits are being eroded by illegals who will work for any wage in any conditions. This has to stop!</p>

		<p>ICE upper management has halted all worksite enforcement raids.  In the past, ICE would raid a large employer, interview the aliens, process them and place them in removal proceedings.  A few of the illegal workers would be used in the criminal investigation.</p>
<p>Well, with the Obama tribe in the White House, all worksite arrests have been forbidden.  All arrests of illegal workers has been forbidden.  The only thing allowed is I-9 Form verification audits.  When the employer is advised that certain workers have mismatched social security numbers, the employees are then asked to correct the info. (which never happens) and if not they are fired.  The aliens are allowed to simply wander off to find another job.</p>
<p>This is a serious scandal&hellip; ask the agents who want to work these cases aggresively.</p>

		<p>Notice the black girl interviewed (Tasha) had the common sense, and the white girl (Melissa) was the head-in-the-clouds liberal.  Smart blacks know they&rsquo;re being replaced by latinos and many are very angry about.  (I have stories to tell&hellip;.)</p>
<p>Truth is, the liberal whites have mostly tired of the blacks who are not conforming to their peace-and-love utopian standards, and they are allowing latinos to come in to give them a new &#8216;helpless&rsquo; group to devote their lives to who are not as violent and who are more pliable with the right carrots.</p>

		<p>Now AmReners need to call their local Chipolte Restaurant, and speak to its Manager, or its main Customer Service line, and let them know that WE support them in this action againt Illegal Aliens. All they hear is criticism from the limp wristed Left, so we need to step up and offer our support.</p>
<p>Our support should also be finacial, by stopping by for a meal, or some Take-out. Remember, money talks, and when we support them in a monetary way, we give them the economic resources to resist all those Left Wing Nut jobs that would excerise a boycott of their Restaurants. </p>
<p>Yes, Mr. Australian, you are quite lucky that your Nation is surrounded by water. </p>
<p>Anon. #12: Yes, Idiots like the one quoted are the reason that our White Nations are in such trouble. They need to bang their heads against a wall to shake what is in there, loose. Obviously, it isn&rsquo;t functioning.</p>

<p>Their attention is probably on rights and solidarity with union workers in Central and South America, and on supporting Obama.  </p>
<p>If the unions came out against migrant Hispanics, they&rsquo;d spark an internal feud with their more radical Marxist elements, who still march under the &#8216;workers of the world unite&rsquo; banner.<br>

<p>Jay, I must respectfuly disagree with half of your post! I think you have it backwards. Progressives(liberal Whites), do/ did not enlist blacks to be a part of thier &#8220;utopia&#8221;. Rather, they use/d  them as a source of ready violence that they can/ could unleash or threaten to unleash upon polite society when they don&rsquo;t get thier way. No justice/ no peace and all that rot. The black middle class has seen steady growth the last few decades and the left needs a new helpless &#8220;victim&#8221; as you stated. When the latins fail to dance to thier tune, they will find some new group to rally around.  </p>

		<p>6:  Most American unions are amnesty and open border all the way.  The only reason some might think they&rsquo;re on our side, i.e. a natural constituency for immigration restriction, is if one still has the dated image of middle aged white men working in manufacturing and heavy industry when think of unionized labor.  In reality, &#8220;service employees&#8221; (read: black and Hispanic mop-floppers) have been the fastest growing segment of unionized labor for decades.</p>

<p>It is a disgusting wrought. Each illegal immigrant costs us, the tax payer, about $80,000 each for them to be housed,the cost of trying to find out their true identities and all the other costs associated trying to determine who these people really are.</p>
<p>Their is much anger here about these illegals. Most of them appear to be economic refugees.</p>

		<p>Firing of ILLEGAL ALIENS? Sounds like one hell of a good idea to me. Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but federal law does prohibit knowingly hiring illegal aliens. Hopefully other businesses will remember their loyalty belongs to Americans and especially Americans expected to patronize their businesses.</p>
<p>My family and I refuse to visit any fast-food franchise, due to the penchant of franchise owners hiring illegal alients (not examining proffered fake I.D. too closely). We stopped eating at Burger-Barf, Slop-in-the-Box and McVomit type restaurants years ago. We&rsquo;re healthier and get far better nutrition as well as saving money. Also the sanitary practices of illegals   &mdash;   I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve all heard those horror stories   &mdash;   like the Latino coming out of a stall, wiping his hands on his apron, then heading back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Sir, I agree with you up to a point. But where I differ is that so many of our young people aren&rsquo;t physically, intellectually, or emotionally able to do what you suggest. For a long time, I thought it was only the hard work of the trades our young men weren&rsquo;t up to. But that&rsquo;s not correct at all. It&rsquo;s all work they&rsquo;re not up to, nor do they want to do work, generally speaking. I&rsquo;m a slow learner, but when I finally understand something, there&rsquo;s no trying to convince me otherwise. I know people who own stores, restaurants, construction firms, etc. and when you talk about our young people to them, they roll their eyes in disgust. In my own case, as an officer of my union and sitting on our Apprenticeship committee, it never ceased to amaze me how unacceptable many of our young men were (I won&rsquo;t even go into the absurd idea of women doing my work), even though we&rsquo;d lowered our standards considerably so they could seem to be qualified. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a very bad situation and the only way out is to stop teaching our young people that work is beneath their dignity, which we&rsquo;ve been doing for many years now.</p>

		<p>To Brian # 18. I agree with what you have said. Once they get to the Christmas, (note, CHRISTMAS! ) Island detention centre they get free air conditioned board &amp; lodging, medicals, legals, net access and $50 PW Pocket Money and usally some sort of legal residency after a few years. This does not exactly discourage boat people and people smugglers.Almost a red carpet welcome, and yes it does cost the taxpayer $$$$</p>
<p>The new Multicultural Lobby Group has accused both sides of politics of having a &#8220;race to the bottom&#8221; when it comes to dealing with illegals, I wish that were true.</p>
