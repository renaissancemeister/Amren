<h1>Germans Seek Ban on Islamic Radicals</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Crawford, Wall Street Journal, December 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Germany&rsquo;s stepped-up efforts to ban some Islamic groups for promoting radical views have sparked a national debate over whether the government is violating the free-speech protections of the constitution it says it is aiming to protect.</p>
<p>The German government&rsquo;s latest move to crack down on groups that promote extremist Muslim teaching came earlier this month, as dozens of police raided homes, offices and religious schools in the western German cities of Bremen, Braunschweig and MÃ¶nchengladbach. The security forces were seeking evidence that could lead to the banning of two organizations that officials say are calling for imposing Islamic law in place of German law.</p>
<p>Interior ministry officials allege that the groups, called Invitation to Paradise and the Islamic Culture Center Bremen, seek to undermine Germany&rsquo;s parliamentary democracy by supporting the establishment of an Islamic theocracy within the country. A security official said the groups also allegedly support a strict form of Islamic justice, such as the execution of Muslims who convert to other religions or the amputation of a hand as a punishment for theft.</p>
<p>Sven Lau, deputy chairman of Invitation to Paradise, rejected the allegations, saying that his group hadn&rsquo;t done anything illegal and that it calls on its members living in Germany to abide by German law. He described the group as a peaceful fundamentalist organization that believes in a strict interpretation of Islamic law, but said it advises members who want to live by its more extreme forms to live in Muslim-governed countries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the latest investigation marks a departure from previous crackdowns by German security and justice officials. German security officials are pursuing a ban of these two Islamic groups primarily because of the principles they espouse, rather than a suspicion of a link to terrorism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The investigation has spurred questions over whether the effort could run afoul of German free-speech protections and further alienate pockets of Germany&rsquo;s Muslim population.</p>
<p>The debate underscores the difficulty that Europe&rsquo;s democracies face in trying to curtail Islamic extremism without violating their own constitutional principles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Until now, such laws have mainly been used to curtail neo-Nazi activism. German authorities will &#8220;need to consider whether those restrictions apply&#8221; in the case of the Islamic groups under investigation, said Manfred Gnjidic, a lawyer who has raised German constitutional-law challenges to defend terrorism suspects.</p>

		<p>Germany is getting close to returning to sanity.  People there understand that Islam and it&rsquo;s influence must be pushed out of Europe.  Immigration from Islamic countries must be shut off completely and those Moslems in Germany must be encouraged to leave.  Hopefully Germany will be the first domino to fall and bring Europeans to their senses.  </p>

Sven Lau?  Sounds like a Swedish name!  What&rsquo;s he doing leading a group of Moslem fanatics in Germany?</p>
<p>The world gets stranger and stranger.</p>

		<p>Bremen is in the far North of Germany, culturally they are much closer to the Dutch and Danes than for instance the Bavarians. Names that sound Skandinavian to you are quite common there.</p>

		<p>@3 GHW,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Sven Lau? Sounds like a Swedish name! What&rsquo;s he doing leading a group of Moslem fanatics in Germany?<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPjaJnRk5cw" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPjaJnRk5cw</a></p>
<p>The extremely religiousity in general and Muslims in particular seem to suffer a profound cognitive dissonance with many of the concepts they seek to espouse such as can only find relief in public display or oratory.</p>
<p>This making a spectacle of their conversion and loyalty is a key signature of the fanatic and of course YouTube makes it so easy to be a fool in public, forever.</p>
<p>If you think about it, the outsider complex is not that of a rebel without a cause but someone who considers themselves an exile within their own culture and so finds hope for his own leadership position by bringing in an outside influence as alliance or strength.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether his/her accomodation tactics are that of a &#8216;true believer&rsquo; or simply in it for the social status change.</p>
<p>Because they seldom think of whether the fanaticism of their new found allegiance is based on what could give their parent culture benefit.</p>
<p>Only that here is something where, as a proselytist, they are themselves &#8216;leading the way&rsquo; in a manner that is the mirror of the imprinted surety which they felt rejected from as their old societal norm.</p>
<p>In this, Mr. Lau has indeed gone the full gamut and speaks in what we would call a hysterical stream of consciousness mode that not even the most rabid of fire and brimstone Christians would try and foist off on whites today.</p>
<p>I am reminded of the Austrian boy in &#8216;The Sound Of Music&rsquo; who was so full of Nazi beliefs because they pumped up his sense of self in a society where he was not recognized for being anything -but- a young, inexperienced, man.</p>
<p>Such a franchised-and-regretting-it youth conscience practically begs for a transition of identity in all cultures but it is only in a &#8216;global village&rsquo; that it so readily finds an outlet for it&rsquo;s iconoclastic madness before adult experience sets in.</p>
<p>As such, it is not restricted to Islam but Islam uses it quite well (simple associative concepts as rules, repeated through multiple rote repetitions in only one tongue) to brainwash the innocent into a politicized cult status which is so easily recognized it never is in danger of gaining real power among Islams really established inner cliques.  As if his skin alone was not enough.</p>

<p>Until now, Angela Merkel and her party haven&rsquo;t been up for re-election.  As soon as the voting is done, so are any serious efforts at such prohibitions against the Islamists.</p>

		<p>I agree with #6 Question diversity, as soon as the elections are over and if Merkel has won, the muslims will have free reign till they either dominate Germany or they will begin serious terror campaigns in Germany and I predict political assassinations if the elections are unfavorable to the muslims.</p>
