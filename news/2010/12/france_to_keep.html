<h1>France to Keep Repatriating Illegal Immigrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, Dec. 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>France will keep up its tough stand on illegal immigrants, having repatriated some 25,500 undocumented foreigners so far this year, Interior Minister Bruce Hortefeux told the daily Le Figaro.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>France has tightened immigration laws in recent years to make it easier to expel foreigners who threaten public order through theft or begging, but was hit by a wave of criticism earlier this year after a crackdown on Roma camps.</p>
<p>Roma, mainly from European Union members Romania and Bulgaria, make up many of the tens of thousands of people who enter France illegally each year, mainly from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Some 8,300 Roma had been expelled by end-August, prompting a rebuke from the European Commission.</p>
<p>The government says the expulsions, which drew fire from the left, the Catholic church and rights groups, were to clear illegal camps and did not target Roma as a racial group.</p>
<p>Hortefeux said a surge in asylum seekers, with France the number three destination after the United States and Canada, created delays and made it harder to sift through genuine and false claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;France, like all countries, has the right to choose who it wants to welcome and who it can welcome into its territory,&#8221; he said, noting that legal immigrants had the same social and economic rights in France as French nationals.</p>

		<p>They can choose who they want to welcome? How about who they choose to throw out? If Algerians can kick the French out of Algeria, and the whole world applaud, why can&rsquo;t the French kick Algerians out of France. Because they offer the French people so many benefits?</p>

		<p>Okay, So 25,000+ went out. But how many came in?!? It could be like that guy I know who would be down fifty with you, pay back ten and then want to borrow twenty-five more&hellip;<br>

		<p>&#8220;Tens of thousands of people who enter France illegally each year, mainly from Europe, the Middle East and Africa.&#8221;  When are they going to get to East Asians?  Besides immigration, education is the most important thing to sustain white society and East Asians TAKE away spots from white students from higher learning who will progress white society not exploit it like East Asians.</p>

		<p>My boat is sinking because of a hole which lets in 5 gallons a minute.  I bale out 1 quart a minute.  My boat still sinks.</p>
<p>France = a sinking boat.</p>

		<p>France has the right to choose who it welcomes? Then so does the rest of Europe, the U.S., Canada, and Australia. </p>
<p>No one has ever asked me if I want these hordes of blacks and browns in my country, and everywhere I look. They know what my answer would be. </p>
<p> The DREAM Act is stalled in the Senate. But they will try and push it down our throats, regardless of the calls to the Representatives and Senators to vote against it. </p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s another 30 million people from the poorest and most depraved places on earth, in our country, matter to the Patricians of D.C.? It&rsquo;s not as if they have to live and work among them, or have their children go to School with these Barbarians; but we do.</p>

		<p>If I could, I would ask the French men who were fed through the &#8220;meat grinder&#8221; at Verdun in 1916 or in Neville&rsquo;s disasterous offensive in 1917 whether any of their efforts were worth this.</p>
<p>I would ask Britons - especially the Scots, Welsh and Irish who suffered casualty rates that would have made any army on earth other than the Japanese mutiny - and Germans and Russians the same question.</p>

<p>&#8216;Death Bed Demography&rsquo; in 17 EU countries, no society has ever recovered from it.</p>
<p>Europe is complacent because it has become used to a Nanny State existence (ironically, Nanny Statism was provided based on the perception that European Citizenry were &#8216;too active&rsquo; in the roll of enabler in WWII) and has lost the innate &#8216;grown up&rsquo; behaviors of breeding and self reliance.</p>
<p>Seems socialized welfare can support an eternal adolescent but not their kids.</p>
<p>So they import a generation of Eurabian replacement children and then lock them up in tenement &#8216;estates&rsquo; which have 40% unemployment rates because, golly wally, nobody wants to employ people that don&rsquo;t look like them, don&rsquo;t act like them and are _dangerous_.</p>
<p>Steyn goes Jewish Liberal just shy of this truth but he gets the basics right.</p>
<p>The one thing he should talk more about is &#8216;the exhaustion of civilization&rsquo;.  Which I think is the final betrayal of our elites for their labor classes.  Promising wealth and enlightenment at the same time they increase taxation and stress and the general cost of living.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the easing of our lives.  It&rsquo;s the dissolution of self belief in trade for hidden stresses.</p>
<p>If you can do without grandparents (what the whole myth of college as the ultimate enabler was really about: freedom from parental ties as separate ennoblement) you can do without grandkids.</p>
<p>Because the truth of the urban crowd is not metrosexualism, it&rsquo;s sustainment of self for so long that our most brilliant workers and potential problem solvers, _can&rsquo;t stand_ to be around dependents themselves.  And would rather pay them off (liberalism as wallet based guilt spasming) than franchise themselves in.  Until it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re past saving our society as an institution.  I recommend reading a book called _The Witch Of Hebron_ as a clue to where our lost soul may come back to us, in the aftermath.</p>

<p>Fascinating questions, to ask in hindsight!</p>
<p>I wonder if they would dare answer you    &mdash;   or risk facing  treason or &#8220;hate crime&#8221;  charges?</p>
<p>Or, if their minds are still so befuddled with wartime propaganda and DeGaulle/Churchill-worship that those old vets cannot see what exists today right before their own eyes?</p>
<p>Yes, I wonder who  they think is responsible for all this?</p>
