<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-politics/20101216/POLITICS-US-OBAMA-TRIBES/">Obama Backs U.N. Indigenous Rights Declaration</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Caren Bohan, Reuters, December 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama said on Thursday he was giving a belated U.S. endorsement to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, drawing hearty applause from a gathering of Native Americans.</p>
<p>The U.N. declaration recognizes the rights of indigenous groups, like American Indians, in such areas as culture, property and self-determination.</p>
<p>The United States was one of a handful of countries to refrain from backing the doctrine in the past, but following a recent review of the government&rsquo;s position, Obama said, &#8220;I can announce that the United States is lending its support to this declaration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Welcoming the move, Robert Coulter of the Indian Law Resource Center said in a written statement: &#8220;The Declaration sets an agenda for the United States and Indian nations to design a reasonable approach to a progressive realization of the duties and responsibilities in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It serves as a guide for consultations among Indian and Alaska Native nations and U.S. governmental departments and agencies,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics say the declaration could lead to American tribes gaining more independence and economic power than is reasonable.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his speech the president outlined a number of programs his administration had implemented and supported that he said demonstrate its commitment to improving conditions for Native Americans and their relationship with the government.</p>
<p>They included bills to enhance judicial and law enforcement systems on Indian reservations, and to bolster health care.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He also cited improvements to roads and Internet services, and suggested many of his administration&rsquo;s broader economic programs would help Indians as well as other Americans.</p>

		<p>uh huh, so when the Iberian, British, French and other European peoples start asking for it, we&rsquo;ll see where BHO feels about it. <br>
Why don&rsquo;t they just admit that indigenous does NOT mean white. </p>

		<p>Hmmmmm.  What AREN&rsquo;T they telling us about what it will do?  Seems like everything coming out of the UN, Obamaville, the MSM et al is designed to dispossess Whites in their own countries while making Whites pay ever more taxes toward colored failure.</p>

		<p>An AMAZING double standard.  These areas are autonomous when it comes to the rule of law, yet completely dependent welfare states.  They even meet the standard of rogue states based on how much money they make as lawless zones for drugs, prostitutes and illegal guns.</p>
<p>The US should have handled this generations ago.  Make these areas completely separate nations with zero aid of any kind.  They can create trade relationships with other countries but criminal activity won&rsquo;t be tolerated.</p>

		<p>Idigenous rights, for indigents and the annointed one believes he speaks for all americans. The question being, what qualifies one to be indigenous, since most of those currently livivg in this country were born and raised here? I am certainly getting sick of hearing how mistreated these people are. You would think that the people who made this a great country walked in here and it was all just handed to them on a silver platter. The hardships and misery endured by them was beyond belief. Far more white european people suffered and died to make this a great country, than all the others combined. We are ruled by educated,idiots the idea that we should return everything back to square one is insane. Reparations are due indeed, but to whom?</p>

		<p>While I admit I&rsquo;m not familiar with the Indigenous Rights Declaration, I&rsquo;d cautiously welcome a recognition of the land rights of the indigenous white tribe of Europe.</p>

		<p>American Indians have had for nearly 100 years a legal status unique among all peoples of the world. Citizens of the U.S. AND also citizens of their sovereign American Indian nations. All the right they have as a U.S. citizen AND all the rights they assume as a member of their respective Indian nation. </p>
<p>When you enter onto an American Indian reservation, you are LEAVING the U.S.</p>
<p>The U.S. has ALWAYS since inception recognized the sovereign rights of the American Indian people. This is no biggy for the U.S. government, what is being acknowledged is what has always been done.</p>

		<p>Will the United Nations show any concern for the rights of indigenous Europeans?  Probably not.  Adjectives like &#8220;indigenous,&#8221; &#8220;native&#8221; and &#8220;aboriginal&#8221; are conspicuous by their absence when old stock Europeans are discussed.  A recent anti-Geert Wilders column by the lefty author Toby Axelrod included this paragraph:</p>
<p>&#8220;Populist doomsayers like Wilders predict a Muslim take-over of Europe, but experts says a gradual demographic shift is more likely. A 2005 study by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life showed that about 5 percent of the EU population is Muslim, with the percentage growing because of higher birthrates among migrants and low birthrates among &#8216;native Europeans&rsquo;.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>Note the sneer quotes around &#8220;native Europeans.&#8221;  Would Mr. Axelrod have felt the need to put quotation marks around &#8220;native&#8221; if referring to the aboriginal peoples of Africa, Australia, Asia or the Western Hemisphere?  Probably not.  At the risk of appearing hopelessly cynical, I expect the U.N. to eventually pass a resolution that reads something like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the Americas are deemed to be the exclusive and inalienable possessions of their indigenous peoples.  However, Europe, the British Isles, and Iceland have no indigenous peoples and are deemed to be part of the common heritage of humankind.&#8221;       </p>

		<p>Empowerment! My favourite (obnoxious) PC word!</p>
<p>Just one aspect of this; I suspect that sooner or later visitors to your national parks will have to pay a fee/get a permit just to take a photo as soon as these parks ineveitably come under indigenous control. (It happened here) That aside BHO will need to print even more $$$ just to pay for it all.</p>

<i>&ldquo;The Declaration sets an agenda for the United States and Indian nations to design a reasonable approach to a progressive realization of the duties and responsibilities in it.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>In short, money.</p>
<p>If I thought it would do any good, I would support it but native Americans have been given millions to help them establish self-sufficiency but they have nothing to show for it.</p>
<p>I guess THIS time it&rsquo;s going to work. If not, the NEXT time surely will.</p>

		<p>I was recently in the U.B.C. Anthropology Museum.<br>
They had had exhibits of Artifacts of not only<br>
B.C. Indians, but Artifacts from Indigenous People<br>
From all the Continents. There is nothing the Left Wing Anthropologists like more than building up Indigenous Peoples i.m.o.</p>
<p>Except, there were no Artifacts from European Peoples in the Museum. They didn&rsquo;t omit having Artifacts from Oceana, or New Guinea though. I don&rsquo;t the Curators are even aware of The forgot about Europe.</p>

		<p>You know, given that there was once a supercontinent before it was divided into the continents we know today&hellip;aren&rsquo;t we *all* indigenous?  And we all came out of what&rsquo;s known today as the Middle East.</p>
<p>I have no problem with Amerinds having their own nation and ruling it as they see fit&hellip;but they shouldn&rsquo;t depend on the white man for anything.  I have no personal issues with Amerinds (and I supposedly have Cherokee ancestry) and my uncle, who lives in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, has plenty of friends from the local Chippewa reservation, but they should have their own nation and we should have our own.</p>
