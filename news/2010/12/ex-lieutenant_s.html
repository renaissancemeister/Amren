<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jerry Lankford, 54, [a former San Francisco police lieutenant] says he was forced to retire after being wrongly accused of being unprofessional when he rapped his badge against a Starbucks window while the coffee store was closed.</p>
<p>The 30-year department veteran said he was unfairly placed on unpaid administrative leave in February and had no choice but to retire after being accused of &#8220;conduct unbecoming an officer&#8221; at the coffee shop in the West Portal neighborhood.</p>
<p>While on his way to work, Lankford, dressed in street clothes and a hoodie, began knocking on the door of the closed store, sources have said. When the clerk ignored him, Lankford allegedly pulled out his badge and began rapping it against the glass.</p>
<p><b>Returning in uniform</b></p>
<p>Lankford left but then returned in uniform and angrily accused store employees of refusing to serve him earlier because he is black, sources said. Someone reported the incident, and Lankford was placed on leave and ordered to turn in his gun and badge.</p>
<p>In a suit filed Friday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Lankford said he had been pushed off the force because of &#8220;false, meritless and unfounded accusations of performance issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>The allegations, he said, were in retaliation for his decision to testify against other officers and for complaining about racial discrimination in the department. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Subject of complaints</b></p>
<p>Lankford is no stranger to controversy.</p>
<p>In 1982, he was suspended for two months after Oakland police said he tried to solicit sex from an undercover officer, though no criminal charges were filed.</p>
<p>In 2003, while off-duty, Lankford was accused of abducting a woman off a Tenderloin street. {snip}</p>
<p>In 2006, after department accusations that he had frequented red-light districts, the Police Commission ruled that Lankford was guilty of three charges related to his having driven through San Francisco and the East Bay with his license plate covered. {snip}</p>

		<p> These dismissals happen often in police agencies   &mdash;   they happened to two or three (White) officers in my hometown. Like Lankford, these guys were given second, third and fourth chances, and finally just wore their welcome out. The one difference was, they didn&rsquo;t have any race card they could play, and he did.</p>
<p> In this day and age, with all the affirmative action, race norming, the permitting of black officers&rsquo; associations, and all the other things this nation has done to benefit black police officers, and with the presence of increasing numbers of them on every urban police force, the idea that any judge or jury would take a claim of &#8220;racism&#8221; seriously as a reason for a firing, is absolutely ludicrous. But then, there are plenty of stupid judges and jurors around. </p>

		<p>Gotta go with the Black guy on this one. Simply  based on the number of Starbuck`s &#8220;Service Failures&#8221; I have been witness to. <br>
 They are the first corporation I have &#8220;downsized&#8221;&hellip; But I used to see baristas (hearing that alone is enough to boycott)pedal up to a store half an hour after their official opening hours. <br>
 Then, instead of putting on six pots of coffee and counting out a register, the guy would go through the whole agonizing opening sequence while two dozen business people looked on in chagrin and dismay&hellip; I wonder if this is what happened to the cop?!? <br>
I myself  have rapped on the window of an &#8220;open&#8221; yet locked Starbuck`s on numerous occasions. What amazed me was how docile the waiting customers would be. Like they didn`t know what else to do but wait. Maybe the cop did what he knew how to do. Push his weight around and get loud&hellip; <br>
 P.S. It`s also the same time I quit buying a morning paper. Win Win for me.</p>

<p>The ONLY way to assure blacks don&rsquo;t disrupt police departments is to not hire them at all. </p>
<p>There are just too many incidents of misbehavior of some sort to have them around.  If it were just a small percentage of blacks who caused some kind of trouble or was incompetent, it might be overlooked, but the majority of them are either too stupid or too crooked to be in law enforcement.</p>

<p>Wow, that was real smart going out dressed like a hood and knocking on a door late at night.  Any reasonable person of ANY race working late at night sees someone who looks like a thug and trying to get in, is going to ignore the person (as in this case) or they are likely to call the cops or they are likely to banish a weapon underneath the counter in case you come in.  Being a cop and knowing most people associate the way he would dress as thuggish (and being a cop and knowing most thugs dress like that), he should have known better.  Oh, and also knowing most of the violent crimes are committed by black males, can a black (police officer) be that stupid to be shocked to discover the clerk didn&rsquo;t want to let him in?  I wouldn&rsquo;t have not let him because he was black, but because he was dressed like a thug.  Hell, there are times I&rsquo;m not comfortable around certain whites who look and talk like punks either.</p>
<p><b>Returning in uniform</b></p>
<p>Lankford left but then returned in uniform and angrily accused store employees of refusing to serve him earlier because he is black, sources said. Someone reported the incident, and Lankford was placed on leave and ordered to turn in his gun and badge.</p>
<p>Since when is someone forced to let you into their place of business or residence if they think you are a threat to them and others?  Typical of blacks.  Even a black cop doing this who was with the department for 30 years should have known better. Then again, looking at his past, he doesn&rsquo;t sound much different than a criminal</p>

		<p>He should have been gotten rid of in &#8216;82. Instead he&rsquo;s been given a pass all these years. All these incidents show he&rsquo;s an abuser of power at the very least and possibly criminal to boot. Makes you wonder what else he&rsquo;s done and gotten away with using his badge as a shield. </p>

		<p>I`ve reread the story and using my best The Saint demeanor&hellip; It was closed. Doesn`t say day or night. The cop was on his way to work. Doesn`t say day or night. Be he came back later on his shift after it was open. So he must have knocked on the door before opening and not after closing. A store closed for the night stays closed over night. But a store not yet open will be open a little later. So I think this adds weight to my belief that he got miffed when the store was supposed to be open but wasn`t on time. </p>

		<p><i>Lankford left but then returned in uniform and angrily accused store employees of refusing to serve him earlier because he is black.</i></p>
<p><i>The 30-year department veteran said he was unfairly placed on unpaid administrative leave.</i></p>
<p><i>Lankford said the disciplinary action that would eventually cause him to retire was racially motivated.</i></p>
<p><i>Lankford claims those charges were all payback for equal-employment complaints about racism filed against the Police Department.</i></p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t over yet.</p>
<p><i>Lankford&rsquo;s attorney, Daniel Ray Bacon, said &#8216;You shouldn&rsquo;t be able to do this to a person who has really a stellar record!&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>The City of SF has filed responses to rebut Lankford&rsquo;s charges of racism, and they may lose, especially if the case comes before kamala harris, California&rsquo;s newly elected black AG.   Lankford may yet get his badge and gun back, receive back pay, a large settlement from SF AND Starbucks, official apologies, be promoted and return to his usual &#8216;conduct unbecoming an officer.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>He was named in five lawsuits against the department that cost the city $59,000.  One suit was filed by another SFPD officer who claimed that Lankford ripped out some of his chest hair during an argument over an incident report.</i></p>
<p>He is black, says he&rsquo;s a victim of racism so therefore workplace rules, performance standards and the law do not apply to him. </p>
<p>And he may be right.</p>

		<p>Nice track record for this clown. </p>
<p>One prior incident. - well, a person can perhaps be forgiven - but it looks like old Jerry was racking them up. His behavior was unbecoming of a normal citizen, much less a police officer.</p>
<p>And to me, this is a prime example of pulling the race card. He probably figured he had nothing to lose. I agree with poster #5 - Jerry should have been fired long ago. They probably wanted to get rid of him and this was their chance.</p>
<p>As for Jerry&rsquo;s previous offenses, it&rsquo;s classic black idiot abuse of power. A good policeman needs a higher IQ but I bet Jerry is running the average for his people - about 85. That&rsquo;s really something to think about. </p>

		<p>I rapped on the locked door of a bookstore a few months ago that was supposed to be open at the time.  The clerk waved at me, so I rattled the door.  She waved again, so I gave her the finger before I went back to my car and drove away, never to return.  I&rsquo;m sure they were very busy doing whatever a bookstore does during open hours whenever it is that they are not selling books.</p>
<p>Bad service is bad service - when the store is allegedly open.  Don&rsquo;t expect them to open up early or stay open late, just because you&rsquo;re a left-handed albino transgendered Inuit.  Or whatever.</p>

		<p>  I worked at a Starbucks a few years ago and those morning hours are sketchy.  It was nothing more than a dark, deserted parking lot when I arrived. If some black guy shows up in the wee hours of the morning, dressed like a thug, tapping some shiny thing on the window that may or may not be a police badge, there&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;s getting in. </p>
<p>  Anyone who tries to tell me that is the wrong thing to do is advising me to behave in a way that could get me killed. I lived around a large number of blacks for a period of time a few years ago and I will never, ever do that again. The only advice one should give Whites, or even Asians for that matter, regarding blacks is stay the hell away from them. </p>
<p>  Any person who encourages mixing with them socially/residentially, is either completely ignorant and sheltered (limousine liberal) or severely malicious and looking to get some White folks killed, raped or both. I draw from this conclusion, that the government and the media in America are the supreme hostile forces seeking to destroy Whites. Through mixing, violence and dispossession. Although I don&rsquo;t think Whites or blacks control these institutions.</p>

<p>There was a bit of a furor several years ago when it was revealed that several police departments were giving intelligence tests to applicants and automatically rejecting those who scored <i>too high</i>. SF must have been one of them.</p>

<p>All that trouble that would land a commoner in jail.  Was he treated gently because he&rsquo;s black?  I doubt it. He got off easy due to the blues protecting their own. It is known euphemistically as &#8220;professional courtesy&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Wiseacre is correct. </p>
<p>The fact is the police offcers are corrupt and cover up for one another regardless of race. I am White and can tell you this is true.</p>
<p>In 2006 five police officers, three White, two Black attempted to frame my son with drugs by planting them in his car.  At the time my son was 23, a graduate student working on his Ph.D. in computer science. He is now a professor at a college in the southeast. My son is a hardworking family man who would never engage in such behavior. </p>
<p>Fortunately, there were two witnesses who had cell phones and taped the incident. The officers were terminated and given 5 years probation. </p>
<p>This left me with a bad taste in my mouth towar cops. Many are good and decent, but there a number who have no business wearing a badge and should be behind bars themselves.</p>
