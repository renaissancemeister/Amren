			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Gibson, Politics Daily, November 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The FBI says the number of reported hate crimes dropped significantly in 2009 from the previous year, to their lowest point in more than 15 years, despite the deepening recession and growing social tensions. {snip}</p>
<p>Whether that downward trend  &mdash;  and the proportionally low number of anti-Muslim incidents  &mdash;  continued into 2010 will only come to light in next year&rsquo;s report. Given the supercharged political atmosphere that marked this election year, and flashpoints like the so-called ground zero mosque controversy and the Koran-burning threats that sparked numerous attacks on Muslims, the numbers could spike.</p>
<p>But for now, religious groups are giving thanks for the decline, even if they have no clear explanations for the drop.</p>
<p>The FBI report shows that there were 6,598 single-bias incidents in 2009, with nearly half motivated by racial bias. The second-highest total was the 1,303 incidents motivated by religious bias, accounting for just under 20 percent of all hate crimes. Overall, the numbers represent a drop of 15 percent in all hate crimes to the lowest number reported since 1994, outstripping the 5.5 percent decline in violent crime in 2009 and the 4.9 percent drop in property crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Studies have found no clear correlation between economic downturns and hate crimes, as many tend to believe should be the case. {snip}</p>

		<p>According to the SPLC, there has been no decline.  But to arrive at that conclusion, they have to water down the definition of &#8220;hate,&#8221; &#8220;crime&#8221; and &#8220;hate crime.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but I just don&rsquo;t think we get one iota of truth from the government, especially the FBI.</p>
<p>Their figures on hate crimes are so skewed they consider Hispanics white as perpetrators and consider them non-white as victims.</p>
<p>Too, they don&rsquo;t list even half the black on white hate crimes that occur annually, and the vast majority they call white on black hate crimes are committed by Hispanics or they&rsquo;re really not hate crimes at all.</p>
<p>The FBI is embroiled in so much illegality anymore, involving the manufacturing of evidence or altering it somehow, they are no more than another lying government agency.</p>
<p>All this is just more evidence of an empire in decline.</p>

		<p>Yeah, the SPLC will keep playing it up that there is a hate crime &#8216;epidemic&rsquo; by redefining hate crimes to include looking cross-eyed at some Muslim, Mexican, Gay, etc. crossing the street in front of your car, causing you to wait until they pass.</p>

		<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t the SPLC be great if they focused on &#8216;hate&rsquo; in the form of crime against whites? The 2 million acts of crime or violence each year by persons of color against whites in the US?</p>

		<p>As I said on the November 22 thread, the hate-crimes report is a complete fraud, it has nothing to say about the real number of hate crimes committed in any given year, it&rsquo;s not real.  It is itself a hate-crime, which leftists often cite to justify their silence about  (sponsorship of) racist violence against whites, by far the most common form of hate-crime in America today.  It is obscene to take this low-level government and media war-crime seriously. </p>

<p>So the anti-immigrant hate-orgy never materialized. Go figure.</p>
<p>Does it matter if it goes up or down? The white-haters would rake in the money if they had only one poster child for &#8216;hate&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>There IS no decline in Hate Crimes. It&rsquo;s just another part of the propaganda spin. There are more hate crimes than ever before except that they&rsquo;re not being reported because they&rsquo;re all being perpetrated against Whites. I won&rsquo;t bore you with the stats about the 34,000+ B/W rapes annually etc. </p>
<p>I hate to bring up Knoxville again but we all know that the police saw no evidence of anti- White hatred. How stupid do they think that we are? They pee against our legs and tell us that it&rsquo;s raining. Who gets to define hate? Remember the judge who said something like &#8220;I can&rsquo;t define obscene but I know it when I see it&#8221;?<br>
He&rsquo;s 100% on the money. Anyone who can look at cases such as Knoxville, Whichita, Missy McLaughlin, Eve Carson etc., etc. and not see hate is a lying SOB and deserves to be the next victim.  </p>
<p>Those crimes were lynchings and nothing less.<br>
