<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>America&rsquo;s primary and secondary schools have many problems, but an excess of excellence is not one of them. Not only do our weak students fare poorly in international comparisons, so do our strong ones. Mediocrity is the national norm.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A case in point is Evanston Township High School in Evanston, Ill., a racially and economically mixed suburb of Chicago that is home to Northwestern University. It recently decided to eliminate a high honors freshman English course aimed at challenging the top students.</p>
<p>Henceforth, these youngsters will be grouped with everyone else in a regular &#8220;honors&#8221; class in humanities. Next year, the same may be done with biology. {snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hardly the only school in America where grouping students according to their ability is in disrepute. There is a widespread impulse to treat all kids as equally able and willing to learn. But the results often fall dismally short of the hopes.</p>
<p>When the Chicago public schools scrapped remedial classes for ninth graders and put everyone in college-prep courses, &#8220;failure rates increased, grades declined slightly, test scores did not improve and students were no more likely to enter college,&#8221; according to a study by the Consortium on Chicago School Research at the University of Chicago. Among average and above-average students, absenteeism rose.</p>
<p>The danger in putting the brightest kids in general classes is that they will be bored by instruction geared to the middle. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Thanks to the abolition of this elite course, we are told, &#8220;high-achieving students&#8221; will profit from &#8220;experiencing multiple perspectives and diversity in their classes to gain cultural capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, racial balance will take priority over academic rigor. Blacks and Hispanics make up nearly half of all students but only 19 percent of those in advanced placement courses and 29 percent of those in honors courses.</p>
<p>This is because minority students at Evanston, which has an enrollment of nearly 3,000, generally score lower on achievement tests. Putting all students together is supposed to give everyone an equal opportunity.</p>
<p>{snip} The low numbers of black and Hispanic students are a symptom of a deeper problem, namely the failure of elementary and middle schools to prepare them for the most challenging course work. Evanston has had a big racial gap in academic performance for decades, and there is nothing to gain from pretending it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Schools that group (or &#8220;track&#8221;) kids by ability generally get better overall results. Chester Finn Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, notes in a recent report, &#8220;Middle schools with more tracks have significantly more math pupils performing at the advanced and proficient levels and fewer students at the needs improvement and failing levels.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There is no excuse for this! Kids that excel do not need to be punished by having to be in class with kids that do not function at a high level. More than likely the class will be dumbed down to the lowest common denominator, the smart kids will be bored at constant repetition and the lower achieving kids will start to act up. The best thing you can do if your kid&rsquo;s school starts doing this would be to sacrifice and get them into a good private school or teach them at home. Another red flag would be having kids work in groups or seeing quite a few group assignments. Usually the smarter kids will end up doing all the work but will still recieve a low &#8220;participation&#8221; grade because other group members did not participate. </p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe they are getting away with this. I don&rsquo;t know if the parents of this school put up any kind of fight, but shame on them if they didn&rsquo;t. When is the dumbing down of our white youth in this country ever going to end? I&rsquo;d pull my kid from this school in a heartbeat. Even if parents have only a High School education themselves, I&rsquo;m sure they could do a better job homeschooling than the nonsense getting ready to take place in these &#8220;honors&#8221; classes.</p>

		<p>Saw it for myself firsthand. School told me I was so smart I could opt for a &#8220;gateway&#8221; program, i.e. a class designed to dumb down smart kids so dumb kids can catch up. They pulled me out of class and had me making paper airplanes and building Play-Doh castles while the dumb kids were learning math and science. I still scored better them on standardized tests. We are going to lose to China and other nations if we don&rsquo;t uncork our heads from our behinds very soon.</p>

		<p>Very good column.</p>
<p>One factor in our government schooling monopolies&rsquo; highly successful war on academic excellence the very low AVERAGE COGNITIVE ABILITY of teachers and, especially, administrators at the K-8 level.  See: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Dismal GRE Statistics for Education Fields&rdquo;<br/>
Wall Street Journal, July 25, 2007 <br/>

<p>Another factor, of course, is the average 4-year white-non-Asian minority achievement gap by 12th grade, which &#8220;educators&#8221; wish consumes &#8220;education&#8221; decision-makers: </p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time [minority students] reach grade 12, if they do so at all, minority students are about four years behind other young people. Indeed, 17 year-old African American and Latino students have skills in English, mathematics and science similar to those of 13-year-old white students.&rdquo; (Education Trust, &ldquo;Closing the Achievement Gap,&rdquo; National Governors Association Clearinghouse, 2002, 9th paragraph) <br/>
http://tinyurl.com/2d6sayq</p>
<p>Still another factor is the protected monopoly structure of schooling in America.  A letter in the Wall Street Journal, in the context of discussing the reform du jour, No Child Left Behind, neatly captured our predicament:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Child Left Behind is a valiant effort to rationalize the fundamentally irrational, centrally-planned system that is our public school monolith. Like the Soviets, we can &hellip; tweak and adjust &lsquo;proficiency standards&rsquo; and &lsquo;adequate yearly progress&rsquo; forever to get the NCLB&rsquo;s heart ticking smoothly. None of it will matter. The system is flawed and &hellip; will wind up on the ash heap of history &hellip; only fundamental reform that establishes a market-based system using educational vouchers to allocate resources through consumer choice will work. (Karl Borden, Professor of Finance, University of Nebraska, April 22, 2005) <br/>

		<p>The first line of this article is probably belied by another AR news item today, about Steve Sailer&rsquo;s breakdown of the PISA scores.  But while the rest of the article is correct, I&rsquo;m unsure if the good neo-cons that write for Real Clear Politics know the kind of hot potato they&rsquo;re handling.  I highly doubt they&rsquo;ll want to follow the next logical step and write about innate racial differences, and even if they don&rsquo;t, leftist criticism or the threat of it will preclude them from doing so, even if their own ideology didn&rsquo;t itself preclude it.  There&rsquo;s nothing a neo-con fears worse than the accusation of racism; they&rsquo;d rather die a death of a million knife cuts.</p>

		<p>At my son&rsquo;s high school, 90 percent of the students in the honors classes are minorities and only 10 percent are white. The minorities are all Asian- half East Asian and the other half are South Asian. THe regular classes are about 70 percent white and 30 percent Asian. Why aren&rsquo;t there programs to increase the number of whites in the honors classes? Why aren&rsquo;t whites crying out that the tests are &#8220;culturally biased&#8221; towards Asians?</p>

<p><i>Thanks to the abolition of this elite course, we are told, &#8216;high-achieving students&rsquo; will profit from &#8216;experiencing multiple perspectives and diversity in their classes to gain cultural capital.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Orwell himself couldn&rsquo;t have written a better of example of Doublespeak.</p>
<p>Eliminating AP and honors classes is the latest educational push (putsch a more apt term) these days for something called Social Justice.  Social Justice is one of many code words for White dispossession.  Asians, caught in the cross-fire, are opening race/culture/language-based K-12 &#8216;academies&rsquo; for their own high achieving  children to escape from the honors, AP-hating government school gulags.  But if I were to even deign to open a school preserving White culture and heritage&hellip;.</p>
<p>It is <b>morally wrong</b> to deny high ability children the means and opportunity to achieve at the highest academic level possible.  But that the vast majority of high-IQ, high ability children are White and Asian means (according to Social Justice theory) that anything that aids and abets their success must be curtailed or eliminated in the name of Social Justice.</p>
<p>Like it or not, people in the top 10% of intelligence produce the everyday, advanced technology we use   &mdash;   new pharmaceuticals, computer chips and software.  These people have a huge impact on whether our economy is vital or stagnant.</p>
<p><i>In 2006, the Department of Education spent about $84 billion. The only program to improve the education of the gifted got $9.6 million, one-hundredth of 1% of expenditures. In the 2007 budget, President Bush zeroed it out.</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  Charles Murray in <i>Aztecs and Greeks</i></p>
<p>I suggest the next high school that opens dedicated to Social Justice be named <i>Harrison Bergeron High</i> in honor of Vonnegut&rsquo;s much beleaguered victim of Social Justice.</p>
<p>From the short story:</p>
<p><i>All this equality was due to the 211th, 212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing vigilance of agents of the United States Handicapper General.</i></p>
<p><i>his intelligence was way above normal [and] he was required by law to wear a mental handicap radio at all times. It was tuned to a government transmitter. Every twenty seconds or so, the transmitter would send out some sharp noise to keep people like George from taking unfair advantage of their brains.</i></p>
<p>We may laugh at this short story now but in the future, our White future&hellip;..?</p>
<p>That is if there is a White future.</p>

		<p>Evanston really deserves to have a poor high school - just like everyone else. It&rsquo;s is one of the most socialistic suburbs in Chicagoland. When the decision to eliminate advanced courses was announced a lot of &#8220;white&#8221; parents actually cheered.</p>

		<p>Kudos to Steve Chapman, a guy who used to write for the Chicago Tribune. He was a rara avis in terris, in that he supported gun rights in Chicago, something unheard of, at the Tribune. He&rsquo;s also not afraid to bash Obama, if he feels the need.</p>
<p>I actually thought Chapman would say &#8220;something else&#8221; was responsible for the Caucasian-Oriental  and Bantu-Hispanic achievement gap, but even he stopped short here. We at Amren know what it is.</p>
<p>In a liberal enclave like Evanston IL, Chapman notes the gap has persisted for DECADES. Why? Why has the achievement gap not narrowed in such liberal enclaves as Evanston, San Francisco, New York, Detroit, Berkeley CA, Hartford CT, and Los Angeles? These cities never promulgated Jim Crow laws.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of that &#8220;something else&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Bon (#8), you remind me of a TV comedy which was screened a couple of decades ago here in Australia. It included advertisements for an imaginary product called &#8220;Thicko&#8221;, which slowed down and generally disrupted children&rsquo;s thought processes, thus making them &#8220;thick&#8221;. Such a child is much less irritating than an intelligent one.</p>
<p>Coming to your school soon - tons of Thicko, to be fed to high-performing kids, if those kids are white.</p>

		<p>Your getting yourselves all hot and bothered over nothing. The only thing our kids have to learn at this point is good position, proper breathing, windage/setting sights, six o&rsquo;clock bull, take up trigger slack, and the right time to let the round go. One round, one hit, and it doesn&rsquo;t mean a thing whether or not the kid can spell rifle.</p>

<p>- I live this kind of nightmare everyday!  The first public high school I worked in was 70% latino and 30% black. One year, I suggested we start an AP class for the dozen or so talented kids we had. (They were languishing in the zoo that was the average class.) The admin, an older, activist liberal jewish lady was AGHAST at merely the suggestion and she used the words, &#8220;That would be ELITIST!  No way!&#8221;</p>
<p>I had to downplay the suggestion as if I were only saying it in jest lest I be put on the chopping block.  In fact, in the urban area where I work, I have never seen a public high school with any &#8216;honors&rsquo; classes at all.</p>
<p>The &#8216;cultural capital&rsquo; thing they harp on is so fuzzy and ill-defined.  They don&rsquo;t realize how racist it is.  The basic premise is that you have to know a person&rsquo;s culture before you can sell him anything.  So if I want to sell a shirt to black people, I have to know their rhythm and way of looking at life.  To sell to an Asian, or Arab or Latino you have to do the same thing, etc.  </p>
<p>They who claim not to be racist put everyone into categories that they assume cannot function outside their boxes, but must constantly peer into everyone else&rsquo;s box to make the world work.  </p>
