<h1>Immigration to Be a Major Issue at Capitol in 2011</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kate Brumback and Shannon Mccaffrey, Beaumont Enterprise, November 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Emboldened by November&rsquo;s electoral gains in the General Assembly, Georgia Republicans are fixing to make illegal immigration a major issue during the upcoming legislative session.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have an ally in incoming GOP governor Nathan Deal, who made tough anti-illegal immigration measures a centerpiece of his time in Congress.</p>
<p>A committee of 14 Republican lawmakers was formed in September to study illegal immigration and to identify its impact on Georgia. The committee aims to fill any gaps in Georgia&rsquo;s laws and to add enforcement tools to laws already on the books, co-chair Rep. Matt Ramsey said.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of talk about the possibility of an Arizona-style crackdown on illegal immigration by giving local law enforcement expanded powers, but Ramsey said the committee won&rsquo;t just cut and paste the text of the controversial law that Arizona passed earlier this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock says it&rsquo;s one issue Georgians seem to care about.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s probably more symbolic than anything else, but it&rsquo;s certainly a topic that resonates with a lot of people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is it going to have an effect that will be felt by non immigrants? Probably not. Is it going to suddenly free up a lot of jobs? I doubt it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the critical mass is, but if enough states enact tough Arizona-type legislation to treat illegals like the criminals they are, including their kids who swarm in our schools, clinics and emergency rooms, Congress will at the least bury &#8220;amnesty&#8221; legislation, and perhaps force Nobama to sign legislation to mandate everify, cut off fed aid to schools that harbor illegals, and keep the illegals out of the Obamacare that will be in effect, and will not be repealed. </p>
<p>Deal with it Tea Partiers, Obamacare is here to stay. The best you can hope for is to keep Illegal Pablo from getting free antibiotics for his endless infections. But I doubt that will happen. See how &#8221; compassionate&#8221; your GOP heroes can be.</p>
<p>But at least cut off private and public employment of illegals, as well as state and fed contracts from these leeches. Starve em out. (You think they&rsquo;re not getting fed and state contracts? Ha!)</p>

		<p>Here is an informed way Georgia legislators can think about the costs of schooling associated with illegal immigration:</p>
<p>Quoting from a U.S. Congressional Budget Office study, &#8220;The Impact of Unauthorized Immigrants on Budgets of State and Local Governments,&#8221; December 2007: </p>
<p>* &#8220;Analyses from several states indicate the cost of educating students who did not speak English fluently were 20 percent to 40 percent higher than the costs incurred for native-born students.&#8221; </p>
<p>* &#8220;Current estimates indicate that about 2 million school-age children (5 to 17 years old) in the United States are unauthorized immigrants; an additional 3 million children are U.S. citizens born to unauthorized immigrants.&#8221; </p>
<p>Thus, roughly 10 percent of U.S. public school enrollment is a direct result of illegal immigration. Simple math: 5 million students (who would otherwise not be here) x $11,000 (estimated average annual per-pupil expenditure) = $55 billion in annual costs. </p>
<p>This estimate is low as it does not include added costs of educating students who do not speak fluent English, nor additional capital expenditures required (school construction, debt service) which typically adds 15 percent to total costs. </p>
<p>SOURCE: CBO study: &#8220;The Impact of Unauthorized Immigrants on Budgets of State and Local Governments&#8221; <br>

		<p>While Georgia lawmakers are studying the impact of illegal aliens on Georgia they should look for a rise in parasite-borne diseases and ailments that coincide with the rise in the illegal alien population.</p>
<p>I have previously commented on AR about used toilet paper on public bathroom floors in everyplace frequented by Mexican illegals. I have also commented on AR about the dangers of porcine tapeworm eggs which are without a doubt on the hands of more that a few of the Mexican illegals who served food in Georgia today.</p>
<p>Recent studies indicate that the prevalence of cysticercosis in Mexico is between 3.1 and 3.9 percent of the total population. Most of the cases are among the poor, rural citizens who so often make the northward journey  to live among us norteamericanos. Such people are involved in American food production in every step between the field and our dinner tables. </p>
<p>So, please, Georgia lawmakers, look beyond the dollars and cents impact of illegal aliens on your state. What you find will spark studies that will affect every American in every state.</p>

		<p>The Biased Press and the Nutty Professor?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about the &#8216;Beaumont Enterprise,&rsquo; but a few things of interest: (1) Although there are exceptions, the press tends to use &#8220;emboldened&#8221; to describe the state of mind of groups that it considers to be at least somewhat unsavory, as in enemy fighters of U.S. troops becoming, from time to time, &#8220;emboldened&#8221;; (2) Maybe this appeared elsewhere in the article, but you have to wonder what is this Professor Bullock&rsquo;s credentials to become, in effect, the ultimate arbiter of this article; (3) &#8220;&#8216;Is it going to have an effect that will be felt by non immigrants? Probably not. Is it going to suddenly free up a lot of jobs? I doubt it.&rsquo;&#8221; What on earth does all that mean? Does &#8220;non immigrants&#8221; mean those who are not illegal aliens plus those who are not legal immigrants? But if the law affects either or both, wouldn&rsquo;t that, by necessity, have some effect on American citizens? As far as the prediction that such measures will not &#8220;suddenly free up a lot of jobs,&#8221; well, what law &#8220;suddenly&#8221; does anything, especially one that will undoubtedly have Obama and the courts fighting it at every turn?  But, all right, what if the efforts of George lawmakers turn out to just free up several thousand jobs, a drop in the bucket for an entire state? Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean the world to a few thousand jobless Georgian? <br>

		<p>Deal with it Tea Partiers, Obamacare is here to stay.</p>
<p>You completely misunderstand the point and goals of the tea party people.</p>
<p>The goal here is to cause a near collapse of the federal government itself.  Destroy the federal reserve.  Handle the aftermath of a worldwide default on sovereign debt (unavoidable at this point and perhaps weeks away).  Elimination of welfare.  Elimination of 90% to 99% of federal spending and most taxes.  Dissolution of the federal courts.<br>

		<p>You deem yourself knowleageable about the Tea Parties, and I take your word for it. But you mentioned NONE of the major spending programs of the out of control federal govt, supported by the out of control US Supreme Court.Let me count the ways we will go broke whether a few piddling little discretionary boondoggles are scuttled by Tea  Party faves like Michelle Bachmann.</p>
<p>Socialized Medicine: Medicare and Medicaid</p>
<p>All federal aid to education, not just the DOE bureaucracy, including &#8220;Pell Grants&#8221; and student loans which should be made by states, private companies and local banks.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense, better known as the Department of Energy Security:  How many hundeds of Billions can be saved by abolishing worthless tasks most of our &#8220;servicepeople&#8221; do. No Id don&rsquo;t appreciate their sacrifice. Most of them live in houses I can&rsquo;t afford and drive cars I can&rsquo;t afford. And most never see a day of combat.And the ones who do are involved in civil wars that are none of the business of the USA.</p>
<p>Homeland Security: The Republicans caved on this. This provides no security and violates individual and gun rights every day. Get rid of it.  I don&rsquo;t fly anymore. Fire the affirmative action morons at the security gates,and the thousands of lawyers and snoops in Washington DC employed by this useful agency. It&rsquo;s really had an impact on Islamists giving up their murderous quests.</p>
<p>The CIA: Lifetime employment for Ivy League grads who can&rsquo;t find useful work in the private sector. The lovely Valerie Plame being an example of what you get.  Playboy, not the CIA, Valerie.</p>
<p>Grow up Tea Party. Granny is owed NOTHING by the federal govt or by taxpayers. Less fed $ to doctors, they will eventually cut their fees. Medical inflation is caused by too many fed dollars chasing too few primary physicians. The Docs can live on a 100 grand per year. Even pay off their loans. We&rsquo;d save hundreds of billions.  </p>
<p>The Tea Party thinks small. Are they even on record about the deportation of illegal immigrants, federal aid to them, and the closure of our borders to ALL immmigrants except those from Caucasian Europe?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d rather have Mexicans than blacks, though neither would be great.  However, since we cannot just trade one for the other, white Georgians should enlist the help of blacks who are going to be losing entitlements to the browns.  Of course, you have to be able to find blacks with a high enough IQ to act in their own best interests.  That might be difficult.</p>
