<h1>DREAM Act Vote Delayed By Democrats</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julie Hirschfeld Davis, Washington Post, Dec. 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Senate moved Thursday to delay a politically charged showdown vote on legislation carving out a path to legal status for foreign-born youngsters brought to this country illegally, putting off but probably not preventing the measure&rsquo;s demise. </p>
<p>Facing GOP objections, Democrats put aside the so-called Dream Act and said they&rsquo;d try again to advance it before year&rsquo;s end. They&rsquo;re short of the 60 votes needed to do so, however, and critics in both parties quickly said they won&rsquo;t change their minds in the waning days of the Democratic-controlled Congress. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bill grants hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children a chance to gain legal status if they enroll in college or join the military. </p>
<p>The House passed it Wednesday night after Democratic leaders painstakingly lined up the votes to push it through. Just eight Republicans joined Democrats to support it while almost 40 Democrats defected to vote &#8220;no.&#8221; </p>
<p>In the Senate, Democrats had virtually no chance of attracting any GOP support to move the legislation since all 42 Republicans have signed a letter pledging to block action on any issue until bills to extend expiring tax cuts and fund the government were completed. </p>
<p>Even once those agreements are reached, though, it&rsquo;s unlikely Democrats would be able to gather the 60 votes needed for quick action on an issue as emotional and complicated as immigration. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The measure is viewed by Hispanic activists and immigrant advocates as a down payment on what they had hoped would be broader action by President Barack Obama and Congress to give the nation&rsquo;s 10 million to 12 million undocumented immigrants a chance to gain legal status. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics denounce the bill as a backdoor amnesty grant that would encourage more foreigners to sneak into the United States in hopes of eventually being legalized as well. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With the GOP taking control of the House and representing a stronger minority in the Senate next year, failure to enact the legislation by year&rsquo;s end would dim the prospects for action by Congress to grant a path toward legalization for the nation&rsquo;s millions of undocumented immigrants. </p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s drive to enact the legislation and congressional Democrats&rsquo; determination to vote on it before year&rsquo;s end reflect the party&rsquo;s efforts to satisfy Hispanic groups whose backing has been critical in elections and will be again in 2012. </p>

		<p>One of the showdowns that is coming is going to be the next budget.  Before the election, the dems left most of the vast increases they earmarked in spending, unfunded.  They did this for the simple reason that we cannot pay for these things with borrowing so any arrangement to pay will involve vast increases in taxes.  Had they voted on the budget, it would have gone ten times worse for them during the election.</p>
<p>But now the election is over and anything done will count toward who gets elected in 2012.  This time around, however, they have to deal with a number of newly elected congressmen and their allies who plan to block ANY budget until their demands are met. What they are doing will be immensely popular but set off a direct conflict between those who get handouts from the government and those who pay for those handouts.</p>
<p>The reason the DREAM act was tabled is the democrats can now give lip service to a HUGE segment of those who get handouts on an issue that they were literally threatening revolt over, while not actually having to do anything.  An attempt to vote on it in the senate would probably failed and enraged those of us who pay for handouts while, at the same time, showing to those who get handouts that the democratic party is weak and ineffectual.</p>
<p>The dems have no intention of spending political capital on illegals, btw.  Their focus is on the budget now.  An interesting question is if the criminal invaders from the third world realize they&rsquo;ve been scammed.</p>

		<p>This legislation is pure double talk. There are qualifying requirements, that illegals have been here so long and are of a certain age. If someone is undocumented how do they prove they qualify? Also we don&rsquo;t need to fill our military with illegals who really don&rsquo;t want to be there. I&rsquo;m sure they will get preference in university admissions at our expense also.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad that DREAM is essentially dead.  However, the dark lining to that nice fluffy fair weather cloud is that certain moderate Senate Democrats, like Missouri&rsquo;s Claire McCaskill, will never be truly tested on the immigration issue while a Democrat is in the White House.  In her first Senate trimester, corresponding with the second half of the second term of Bush 43, McCaskill was stand-up on the immigration issue   &mdash;   She opposed &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform,&#8221; and pushed to prevent the obnoxious amnesty queen Julie Myers from running ICE.  The question was at the time whether she was really on our side, or just reacting to a Republican President.  The answer would have to wait until a Democrat was in the WH (which eventually came in the person of Barack Obama, who McCaskill supported over HRC from the get-go), and an immigration bill grew legs.  This was as close as it will ever come to happening.</p>

		<p>What the Dream Act really says.</p>
<p>1. Immigrant &#8220;children&#8221; means up to the age of 35 with waivers<br>
for age possible.<br>
2. Dream Act recipients are elibible to begin chain immigration<br>
for other relatives still in Mexico<br>
3. The &#8220;military&#8221; requirement is waivable.<br>
4. No proof is required as to when exactly the recipient <br>
arrived in the USA..as illegal crossings are not registered<br>
5. In state tuition for out of staters is something no white<br>
American citizen enjoys..not even veterans.</p>
<p>IN SHORT..THE DREAM ACT IS A BLANKET AMNESTY</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a thought for the Republicans.  Rather than pander to the illegals and totally alienate most Americans trying to sway Hispanics to the Republican cause, which will never happen&hellip;..how about they reduce the votes guaranteed the Democrats by DEPORTING AND EXPELLING the millions of illegal aliens.  We all know they are voting in &#8220;sanctuary cities&#8221; and everywhere else Dems control the polls.  </p>

		<p>Though they don&rsquo;t yet have the 60 votes needed to invoke &#8220;cloture&#8221; on the the DREAM Act, Senate Democrats are still intent on ramming the bill through in the lame duck Congress.  See:</p>

		<p>I think this budget battle is nothing more than the Democrats running out the clock on the DREAM act so they do not have to vote for it.  The Democrats are a lot smarter than the Republicans.  They understand that once Hispanics get demographic superiority, they they have this nasty habit of getting rid of all Non-Hispanic politicians (no matter how much Hispandering they have done in the past) and vote in their own.  That&rsquo;s exactly how Bob Dornan lost his office.  Flipped off his White constituents and told them to resign themselves to their own dispossession by the Hispanics.  Then whined to beat the band when the Hispanics ran one of their own women against him.  And I say, good for them.  Never EVER trust a politician who would stab his own people in the back.  Race traitors should never be allowed to profit from their treason.  EVER.</p>
<p>So, I think Obama will cut some back-door deal where he will sign in a blanket amnesty the moment he retakes office in 2012.  Make them understand he couldn&rsquo;t tick off the Whites and his black constituents before then.  Most Republicans are pro border enforcement and fiscal conservatives.  Hispanics won&rsquo;t want to vote Republican because not only is another DREAM amnesty dead in the water, they will see their social entitlements cut.  </p>
<p>The Democrats will remain publicly pro-borders enforcement but will find some way of keeping amnesty off the table via other parliamentary procedures in the reasonable expectation that Hispanics will vote Democrat because they perceive the Republicans as the Pro-White party.  Too bad nothing could be further from the truth.<br>

		<p>Question Diversity, I believe Claire McCaskill is as solid on the illegal immigration issue as John McCain.  Ever since the Tea Party gained sway, she&rsquo;s been talking more like a right-wing populist.  Obviously, she fears a primary challenge and intends to bend with the wind as far as necessary.<br>
As bad as it is on the surface, the DREAM Act is fraught with between-the-lines interpretations that make it a highly dangerous piece of legislation.  Proponents constantly try to minimize its impact, even to the point of either lying by omission or outright lying.  I&rsquo;ve heard one of them argue that it would enable the foreign-born to serve in the military, yet that already happens.  Some claim the law wouldn&rsquo;t enable those affected to bring in more relatives, but once they become legal, why not?  Why on earth would Repubs saddle themselves with this albatross?  I can&rsquo;t wait till the end of this lame duck, when this and the DADT repeal initiative die!  A GOP House will never bring them up again, and the filibuster will make them a fool&rsquo;s errand in the Senate.</p>

		<p>The DREAM act is far from over.  Reid bought himself and pelosi another week to bribe, strong arm or threaten senators for a YES vote.  Stay tuned, remain ever vigilant and see here as to what you can do to stop this  abomination:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/c4vvx4" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/c4vvx4</a></p>
<p>And, as usual, media such as the <i>Washington Compost</i> won&rsquo;t tell the public what is really in this bill:</p>
<p><i>According to a GOP memo, illegal aliens could still qualify for the DREAM Act even after committing assault, domestic violence, marriage fraud, visa fraud, voter fraud, multiple DUIs, sexual abuse and reckless driving.</i> </p>
<p><i>No one can be deported once an application is made, even if it takes years to adjudicate and it will grant a path to citizenship to an estimated two million individuals&hellip; Any person up to the age of 35 can apply by enrolling in college or the military&hellip; if they drop out of a two-year college program, they can apply for a waiver under the law&rsquo;s &#8216;hardship&rsquo; provisions.</i> </p>
<p>And, once granted &#8216;amnesty&rsquo; those millions who qualify (and you can be sure the government&rsquo;s numbers are vastly under-reported) will then be able to start the daisy chain of &#8216;family reunification&rsquo;   &mdash;   including the illegal parents who broke US laws by crossing the border.</p>
<p>I have nothing but contempt for reid, pelosi and others of their ilk who should be up on charges of sedition instead of lording over the US senate encouraging others to ignore US Laws.</p>

<p>Ah, but they don&rsquo;t have to prove anything. For the Democrats, that&rsquo;s the beauty of the act. </p>

		<p>Republicans, you were most conspicuously given by the American people a vote of trust in November of 2010. Do not sell out!</p>
<p>The Dream Act is a saccharine euphemism for a directive: &#8220;Rich industrious White Americans, you give and give and keep giving till WE (that is, everybody else in the world) tell you that you have given enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have a DREAM: that White Americans regain and maintain that which God has so obviously granted us. Jesus said, &#8220;A Tree is known by its fruit.&#8221; After more than a half century of the mission-to-attain-equality-at-Whitey&rsquo;s-expense, let us take serious note of where we are today and where we wish to be tomorrow. Look at the Fruit of Mexico; look at the Fruit of the U.S.A. Which do you want? Which do they want? Does the Dream Act promise the U.S. that she will get  &mdash;  as she did during the European &#8220;brain drain&#8221; of WWII  &mdash;  the brightest and the best, Nobel-prize winning authors and physicists? No. We get to keep and pay for millions and millions more peasants and criminals and non-Americans who have no wish to assimilate as those educated European immigrants of the past did. </p>
<p>I grew up in a California that had the FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. Today, the population of California is five times greater, and the population of my native Southern California is at least ten times greater &hellip; and Governor S. just announced a STATE OF EMERGENCY because they are 160 billion dollars in debt. California has tens of millions more third-world immigrants and with them California has more prisons, more crime, more instability, and the irreplacable loss of a true dreamland. </p>
<p>What could have happened to California in the past few decades to account for this? How and why did beautiful Utopian city after city fall victim to &#8220;White Flight&#8221; for decades and become third-world, overpopulated and bankrupt?</p>
<p>I have a DREAM &hellip; that Americans of European ancestry who built this Unique Nation will cease to believe in THE LIE that they have been forced to swallow: the LIE that they are bad, and that all non-Whites are victims, and that the Whites and their children must be brought down a notch or two so that all children all over the world can hold hands and finally feel good about themselves. And I have a DREAM &hellip; that Americans of European ancestry will accept and understand that their culture IS incomparable and superior, and that is why people with any sense anywhere in the world would love to come and live here  &mdash;  because our culture is blessed and exceptional. However, history shows that when a White majority is replaced by a non-White majority, the civilization falls. Invariably. </p>

		<p> I vote and will be continuing to vote as long as I am able. I think that the Dems. will pass the dream act and take the rage of me and mine. They will try for a dark of night vote with as many opponets safely out of the chamber as possible just like the income tax vote. It will come while everyone is home for christmas holidays probably.<br>

		<p>Keep a sharp eye on the Senate and watch for an end-run. I would not be at all surprised if this perfidity passes in the same way we had the Federal Reserve system pushed down our throats; a last minute vote while most of the Senate is out of town. It is frankly sickening that this passed the House, and I would hope that someone would list the RINO&rsquo;s who voted for this abomination.</p>

<p>You are entirely wrong about this.  The Democrats see amnesty as a crucial issue   &mdash;   when the illegals are made citizens they can vote and 75% of them will vote for Democrats.  The Democrats know that the white electorate won&rsquo;t vote for them so their grand plan is to replace the electorate.  This is far more important to them than some budget bill   &mdash;   after all whatever money is needed will be magically created by the Fed as usual.</p>
<p>Call your Senator soon and tell him politely that you don&rsquo;t want this massive amnesty.  Thousands of phone calls just might tip the balance.  (My two senators are hopeless.)<br>

<p>DREAM Recipients: How Many Millions Will Try to Pass for Under 30?</p>
<p>Posted By Brenda Walker </p>
<p>Remember this guy? He was the 25-year-old Honduran crack dealer Jose Mendoza Cerrato who successfully masqueraded as a juvenile in permissive San Francisco using fake identification that portrayed him as being 17. So instead of being tried, imprisoned and later deported as an adult felon, he was sent at taxpayer expense ($7K/month) to a comfy group home in San Bernardino County to receive culturally appropriate liberal counseling. (See my blog item, Another San Francisco Poster Boy Crack Dealer,)</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is that illegals procure fraudulent IDs specific to their needs. If the miscreants need to be juveniles, then no problema. They just stipulate that requirement when ordering up their fake papers from the local distributor.</p>
<p>The usual estimate of eligible persons for the DREAM Amnesty is two million, but that number is based on the numbers of illegals who are actually under 30.</p>
<p>But since there is no requirement for the authorities to check any of the applicants&rsquo; papers, the varieties of fraud will most certainly include age. Persons who genuinely graduated from high school, but at a time inconvenient to pose as under 30, will buy a fake diploma online with a better date.</p>
<p>If the amnesty passes, I&rsquo;m thinking there will be gigantic rush on hair dye among the post-30 alien crowd to look younger by coloring over the annoying grey.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no punishment for lying on the application, so the question is who won&rsquo;t apply? And who behind the desk will question anyone for looking too old? It won&rsquo;t happen.</p>

		<p>I personally think that the Dream Act is pushed by Democrats to kowtow to the Latino vote. This ia population that historically has not voted in large numbers because a good portion of their population is ineligible to vote because of citizenship status. With the unemployment rate being what it is in the majority of states, why open the door now and let these Dreamie kids compete with the unemployed population? I find that these kids are going to find the Dream Act a disapointment because if the join the military, they are going to find several fields closed to them because they are not US citizens such as Special Forces, Navy Seals, Marine Guards at US embassies overseas and the inability to become a commissioned officer or any other miitary job that requires any security clearance they would be unable to get.</p>

<p>Like all these half-witted Chicano &#8220;Dreamers&#8221; are actually going to want to risk having to die for a country they hate?  They don&rsquo;t want to go into those special fields.  They&rsquo;ll be perfectly happy in &#8220;support&#8221; fields (read: cooks, mop-floppers), where they are lauded for being a &#8220;hero&#8221; while they walk in their camos through the international airport on their way home for Christmas, while risking almost nothing.  And if they receive any real military training, that&rsquo;s an extra added bonus   &mdash;   They can pass it on to their gang buddies in Los Angeles and Ciudad Juarez.</p>
