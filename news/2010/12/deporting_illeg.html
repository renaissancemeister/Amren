<h1>Deporting Illegals Can Be Expensive, Slow</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matt Reed, Florida Today (Stuart, Florida), December 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than three months and about $12,000 in detention costs later, illegal immigrant Ali Moussawi (aka Aldo Barone) appears to be home for the holidays.</p>
<p>Moussawi is an Italian chef and restaurant manager who tried to turn himself in to immigration authorities after seven years of work in the shadows of Florida&rsquo;s service industry. Although he had no visa, paid no taxes and once served jail time for theft, Moussawi had not recently committed a crime. So, neither the Melbourne police, the Border Patrol nor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would take him in.</p>
<p>I had arranged to drive the man who called himself &#8220;Aldo&#8221; to ICE offices in Orlando. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I can confirm that he was removed to his home country of Italy,&#8221; ICE spokeswoman Dani told me when I checked on him last week.</p>
<p>COSTLY DETENTION</p>
<p>Moussawi, 42, exposed a little-understood hole in U.S. immigration enforcement  &mdash;  a strategy that targets only dangerous criminals and spends billions on border enforcement but lets millions of illegal workers such as Moussawi walk free.</p>
<p>His months awaiting deportation exposed another truth about illegal immigration: Rounding up and expelling aliens from Florida is a slow, expensive and secretive process.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Moussawi had received his deportation orders from a judge within &#8220;a couple days&#8221; of arriving at Krome, he said. But weeks passed, then months. Officials would not tell him why he remained.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ICE typically &#8220;removes&#8221; aliens from Florida on commercial flights or, sometimes, chartered planes if it has enough detainees bound for the same country. Forget buses. Only one-third of illegal immigrants in Florida come from Mexico or Central America. Most come from Europe, South America, the Caribbean and Asia.</p>
<p>One-way flights from Miami to Rome cost as little as $693 on Air Berlin and $906 on Swiss Air.</p>
<p>By comparison, housing someone at an ICE detention facility costs $846 per week, on average  &mdash;  nearly three times the cost for male inmates at Florida prisons.</p>

		<p>What it brings to mind is how are whites going to keep them out after we have our own white country? For some reason, I imagine it will not to be a problem at all. Personally, I would be in favor of allowing some non-whites to live in our new country under limited conditions.</p>
<p>I somehow just imagine it will be as easy as pie keeping them out. How will we do it?</p>

		<p>Very expensive to deport them and even more expensive to let them stay and breed a generation of welfare babies.  The best case would be to STOP them at the boarders.</p>

		<p>Well, this is why there needs to be a military presence at the border to keep them from entering in the first place.</p>

		<p>We spend, on average, 60 billion dollars a year, EACH, in AfG and Iraq.  12,000 dollars per head, times 400,000 illegals which ICE says they sent home, annually, in the last two years = 4.8 billion dollars a year.</p>
<p>Bring the troops home.  Spend 20 billion dollars a year on border security.  We will be safer, the soldiers will be closer to their families and the money spent will go back into our economy rather than helping terrorists keep their families fed in back of beyonds like AfG where we pay for ever door we kick down and every farm animal that steps on a Soviet era mine that &#8216;might&rsquo; have been from an American CBU.</p>
<p>This massive difference in expenditures for winnable vs. ungrateful causes is why I have always said: Forget the 14th Amendment.  Forget the Entitlement cutoffs.  Even forget E-Verify.</p>
<p>Until and unless we _secure our national borders_ we are only throwing good money after bad, chasing the robber already in our bedrooms.  Because the Illegal Aliens can return for a lot less than we sent them back for.</p>
<p>And no, you don&rsquo;t need to kill.  You can use heat guns and sound guns and fire cracker mines (looks like bird poop, makes a bang like a toy cap pistol) that alert acoustic trackers and brings the BP and UAVs which the Mexican Horde can never escape from.</p>
<p>If we won&rsquo;t do this, even in the face of OBVIOUS, GENETIC, RACIAL, _DEFICTS_, in use of welfare and IQ based lack of high tech job skills, we cannot hold onto the nation state and must begin to think of Seceding to a survival mode like the city states of Europe.</p>
<p>It breaks my heart to say this.  But those are the alternatives.  Because our real enemy is the corruption and stupidity of liberals.  And if we can&rsquo;t convince, convert or kill our own to win the argument, we must still save ourselves regardless.</p>
<p>And let social Darwinism prove one side or the other, right.</p>

		<p>Worse in Missouri, and Illinois where they typically just give them a summons to have to appear in an immigration court 6-12 months later, and most of them never return. When they do eventually get rounded up again, they often release the same ones that didn&rsquo;t show with another summons rather than hold them. </p>
<p>If it didn&rsquo;t destroy the country I could laugh at what a total, and complete joke the idea is that they enforce any kind of internal immigration controls. It plays nice for the media, but the reality on the ground is pretty pathetic. A simple set of car stops in St. Ann, Missouri would yield thousands of illegals with little effort; the majority of illegals being from Mexico, but Guatemala, Honduras, Haiti, many African nations, and even former a few Eastern European nations would be represented.   </p>
<p>Even for illegal aliens that commit crimes, most of the pre-trial detention facilities (jails) do not have any formal relationship with ICE to deport the illegals, and even if they do, its more likely that they will get a speeding ticket like summons to voluntarily appear 6 months to a year later in an immigration court than to be held over for trial. The most likely scenario is they get released after they make bail, or after a short stint for their crime, with no deportation hearing, and ICE either isn&rsquo;t notified, or refuses to come, and pick up 1-20 illegals. If ICE does bother, they merely refuse voluntary deportation, and get the summons for a long date first appearance. (Even if they did show, appearing there is mostly just a guarantee to set another date several more months into the future.) </p>
<p><br>
Pretty much the only way someone actually gets deported in this system if they agree to voluntary deportation. In fact, some of the illegals try to use it as a free ride home to see family, and will show up voluntarily at enforcement centers for just that purpose. Even when they show up voluntarily, ICE still wont routinely deport even the willing because &#8220;we are not a taxi service for undocumented migrants&#8221;. </p>
