			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrick J. Buchanan, buchanan.org, December 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Buried in the Oct. 30 Washington Post was a bland headline: &#8220;Report Points to Faster Recovery in Jobs for Immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>The story, however, contained social dynamite that explains the rage of Americans who are smeared as nativists and xenophobes for demanding a timeout on immigration.</p>
<p>In the April-May-June quarter, foreign-born workers in the U.S. gained 656,000 jobs. And native-born Americans lost 1.2 million.</p>
<p>From July 1, 2009, to June 30, 2010, foreign-born Hispanics gained 98,000 construction jobs. Native-born Hispanics lost 133,000. Black and white U.S. construction workers lost 511,000 jobs.</p>
<p>According to the Center for Immigration Studies, from Jan. 1, 2000, to Jan. 1, 2010, 13.1 million immigrants, legal and illegal, entered the United States, a decade in which America lost 1 million jobs.</p>
<p>From 2008 and 2009, the figures are startling. In 24 months, 2.4 million immigrants, legal and illegal, arrived, as U.S. citizens were losing 8.6 million jobs.</p>
<p>Query: Why are we importing a million-plus workers a year when 17 million Americans can&rsquo;t find work? Whose country is this?</p>
<p>Why do we not declare a moratorium on all immigration, until our unemployment rate falls to 6 or 5 percent? Charity begins at home. Ought we not take care of our own jobless first before we invite in strangers to take their jobs?</p>
<p>According to the Pew Hispanic Center, each year between 300,000 and 400,000 &#8220;anchor babies&#8221; are born to illegal aliens. These newborns are entitled to citizenship, free health care and education, welfare and food stamps</p>
<p>Their parents  &mdash;  almost all are poor or working class  &mdash;  rarely pay any state or federal income tax.</p>
<p>How long can we keep granting citizenship and full social welfare benefits to the children of people who break our laws and break into our country or overstay their visas? How long can we keep bringing in workers to take jobs when our unemployment rate hovers around 10 percent?</p>
<p>Again, according to the Pew Center, the number of anchor babies here now is about 4 million. Add to that 3 million to 4 million born each decade, and it will not be long before Colorado, Nevada, Arizona and Texas resemble California, which is on the brink of default.</p>
<p>If no action is taken, the Republican Party will soon be unable, even in wave elections, to win the presidency, as it won nothing and indeed lost state legislative seats in California in 2010.</p>
<p>The border will disappear, and America will be a geographical expression, not a country anymore.</p>
<p>Legal scholar William Quirk describes a new phenomenon in the invasion of America: &#8220;maternity tourism.&#8221; Pregnant Asian women pay $15,000 to agents to ensure they are in the United States when their child is born so that they can return home secure in the knowledge he or she will be a U.S. citizen with the right to a U.S.-taxpayer subsidized education in college.</p>
<p>Though the nation has awakened to the threat to social cohesion and national solvency, Harry Reid is still attempting to ram through a lame-duck Senate an amnesty for illegal aliens up to age 30 who claim they were brought here before they were 16, have a high school diploma or GED and state that they intend to go to college within six years.</p>
<p>An estimated 2.1 million illegal aliens would be amnestied, put on a path to citizenship, and be eligible for student loans and more.</p>
<p>According to Alabama&rsquo;s Jeff Sessions, ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee:</p>
<p>&#8220;Aliens granted amnesty by the DREAM Act will have the legal right to petition for entry of their family members, including their adult brothers and sisters and the parents who illegally brought or sent them to the United States, once they become naturalized U.S. citizens. In less than a decade, this reality could easily double or triple the 2.1 million green cards that will be immediately distributed as a result of the DREAM Act.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lawbreaking would be rewarded. Chain migration would continue. A permanent powerful magnet would be provided to all foreigners to sneak into the United States and be sure to bring the kids.</p>
<p>As Rep. Dana Rohrabacher argues, one effect of the DREAM Act will be to move illegals applying to college ahead of many Americans, as 80 percent of illegals are Hispanics and eligible for affirmative action.</p>
<p>U.S. soldiers coming home from Afghanistan will &#8220;sit in back,&#8221; as Obama puts it, when competing against amnestied illegals.</p>
<p>Several days ago, UCLA&rsquo;s Kent Wong addressed a pro-amnesty rally in Los Angeles&rsquo; MacArthur Park. Wong turned the race card face up.</p>
<p>When Reid&rsquo;s bill passes, said Wong, &#8220;the young people of the DREAM Act movement will go on to accomplish and do great things. &hellip; You will go on to become lawyers, teachers, doctors and members of the U.S. Congress to replace those old white men.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp..;&#8221;</p>
<p>If the DREAM Act passes, Wong is right about whose time has come and gone. May the tea party take names at the call of the roll.<br>

<p>Funny, I have seen just a documentary (made by lefties), which said that &#8220;the people&#8221; thought 50 years ago if Congo, Rwanda and Zimbabwe get free from white governments, they will give a boost to human beings with their creativity and different culture. Well we know what happened. And I am pretty sure either Mr Wongs kids will live in an Asia area where they vote very right and oppose immigration or will move to the last white areas maybe in Russia were they call for more diversity.</p>

		<p>Buchanan is one of the tiny number of establishment conservatives that tells it like it is. What is most disturbing about the statistics that Pat includes in his column is the revelation that our political class do not care one bit about us. If they could make the White majority disappear tomorrow it would be not soon enough. It is a bit heartening that there is a growing disquiet amongst Whites. I&rsquo;m fairly pessimistic, but I do hold out some hope that enough of us will wake up before the point of no return is reached. It is a good sign that more and more states will enact restrictive immigration laws. </p>

		<p>Speaking of the DREAM Act and supposedly moderate Senate votes, I wasn&rsquo;t able to listen to it, but I heard from one of my spies that Claire McCaskill was a guest on a local pseudo-conservative talk show today, and that when the host, herself not quite the sharpest tack in the rug, quizzed McCaskill on DREAM, she all but said she was for it without actually saying she would vote for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m through with Claire McCaskill, officially.  But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ll vote Republican when she&rsquo;s up in 2012;  It all depends on the Republican nominee.  If the Republican is some dud, then I vote third party.</p>

He makes many good points but I have to ask, why doesn&rsquo;t Mr. Buchanan have more influence in policy circles? He doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a part of any think-tank or alliance. No one seems to take him seriously anymore. Why?</p>

		<p>More people equals more consumption.</p>
<p>The answer to Buchanan&rsquo;s rhetorical question, &#8220;why are we taking in more people while so many are unemployed&#8221; is because immigration policy is about getting more consumers integrated into the supply and distribution chain.</p>
<p>Non-whites will cause divisions in society which will distract from economics.</p>

		<p>The United States, if it continues, will be nothing more than a geographic location in a mess called Latin America. Most people within this geographical location will be non-white or mestizo, with a few pockets of European civilization surviving. Our cities will become like that of many Latin American cities, just look at what has become of cities such as Los Angeles and Detroit, once great cities. Our descendents will have to fight just to survive in this new world as the despised Euro-American minority. I hope that their fate is not as bad as that of our siblings in Zimbabwe or South Africa. </p>
<p><br>
Latinos are not immigrants; they are a mass of invaders whose goal is not to become &ldquo;Americans&rdquo; (if they even can) but rather to expand the wasteland they fled. These immigrants do not embrace the things that made America great, our fragile balance between individualism and community will be completely thrown off, our democratic values, institutions, and identity will be destroyed. These people will gladly throw away rights if it means more government goodies and once this land is drained and ruined, they will move onto another. Perhaps Canada will be weak enough at that point?<br>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s part of the reason. But it&rsquo;s a complex issue, having no single, simple reason.  There&rsquo;s a lot more to it than just that.  It&rsquo;s a complicated  issue that&rsquo;s been cleverly designed to appeal to a variety of different supporters for  a variety of different reasons. They all have a personal  iron in the fire to defend.  That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so hard to confront.</p>
<p><b><i>Buchanan is one of the tiny number of establishment conservatives who tell it like it is.</i> </b><br>
 <br>
He tries.  But even he doesn&rsquo;t fully &#8220;tell it like it is&#8221;.   I can&rsquo;t believe he doesn&rsquo;t see the entire picture more than he reveals.   But he has to play politics and tiptoe softly to keep his position and his respectability.   If he did  tell it like it is,  he would be exiled  overnight to anonymity (like Helen Thomas), treated as a senile old wacko, and would never be heard from  in the mainstream media again. </p>
<p>People employed in the  govern-media all have to toe the line and say what they&rsquo;re supposed to say &hellip; just that, but not more than they&rsquo;re supposed to say, at the risk of facing professional oblivion.</p>
<p>We brag that we have Freedom of Speech.  Yes, you can say or write anything you want   &mdash;   but there&rsquo;s no guarantee that anyone will ever hear it or read it.</p>

		<p>Hard not to notice what is going on in EU, such as Greece and Italy with their escalating problems with Africans and muslims. These muslims and Africans are willing to sneak into other countries and fight with the police, the armies or other authorities but they are NOT willing to fight in their own countries to make them better, why is that??? It is because after they get into the EU, THEY GET FREE STUFF!</p>

		<p>Yes,this is our America. All we have to is take it back. But we can&rsquo;t be cowards. Blacks and hispanics aren&rsquo;t courageous people. All they have going for them is the idea that they don&rsquo;t give a darn. Why should they? They don&rsquo;t fit in here and they know it. That&rsquo;s the bottom line of their supposed &#8220;bravery.&#8221; Once they&rsquo;re confronted by a determined White man, they just give up. There was an old story that there was some cattle rustling going on down near the Rio Grande and a Texas Ranger showed up to get the cattle back. The mexicans were so petrified, they sent more cattle back over the border than were originally stolen.</p>

		<p>While we are here focusing on a vote, not one illegal immigrant is being deported.  This government is lawless.  Even if with stop the Act from passing the flood of immigrants will continue and possibly increase.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a numbers game.  We must become proactive and start the deportations.  First puch with your representative to make illegal entry into this country a felony offense.</p>
<p>And quit calling it an open border.  Could white Americans go into Mexico and do the same things that Mexicans come here and do? Also quit calling them illegal immigrants they are invasive Mexican nationals.</p>
<p>Send their employers to prison and make it very public.  </p>
<p>Why not have all White Nationalist organizations push in a joined concerted method to undo this push one for English push two for Spanish.</p>
<p>We need to quit being reactive but push for our own measures that we can see immediate results for.  Anything that doesn&rsquo;t quickly result in less immigrants, even legal is not good enough.  Legal sounding words on paper will not do at this point.</p>
<p>As for anchor babies we don&rsquo;t need to do anything but insist that the common sense of the words be followed and these invaders be repelled.</p>

		<p>I talked to an engineer a year or so ago. He&rsquo;d been out of work, at the time for a year or more. Couldn&rsquo;t even get an interview. One day around October he was called in for an interview. He said that was the very week that the HB-1 Visa quota had been filled up. I don&rsquo;t think he was lying to make some kind of political point. Not at all. Political correctness is against that. But it does work the other way&hellip;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d take Buchanan more seriously if he were an unapologetic pro-White spokesman.  Unfortunately, he has never been more than a Respectable Conservative, delicately pointing out the decline of &#8220;The West&#8221; (known to the rest of us as &#8220;White People&#8221;), yet always pulling his punches, afraid to say anything Racist that might upset his Respectable Conservative friends in the neighboring pews.  </p>
<p>When Buchanan comes out unequivocally on the side of White people, <i>then</i> I&rsquo;ll take him seriously.  He&rsquo;s an intelligent guy, but until he gets over his squeamishness at being proudly White, he&rsquo;s not going to do us much good.<br>

		<p>The basic assumption of Amren&hellip; is that Western culture is White culture&hellip; and the two are inseperable.. I think.. Thus, if America is eventually populated in majority by non whites&hellip;it will cease to actually operate as a western culture. Unless somehow Whites can hold the majority of political and economic power. Non whites may believe this possible scenario to be unjust&hellip; racist&hellip; etc&hellip; but&hellip; what nations ruled by non whites enjoy the standards of living with the rule of law etc&hellip; as white nations do..? Pat Buchanan is simply stating the obvious&hellip; You can&rsquo;t maintain your integrity by giving it away. Entropy is always working to erode what is not maintained.. to return to the course and primitive what is not disciplined with high ethos.</p>

		<p>The point I&rsquo;m about to make seems to split the uprights between 4 sbuffalonative and 13 Blaak Obongo.</p>
<p>PJB&rsquo;s only regular media appearances these days are on MSNBC and as the right winger on The McLaughlin Group, unfortunately both have minuscule audiences.  The only reason MSNBC tolerates him is because he denounces the Republican Party and neo-conservatism at times (not that he&rsquo;s wrong).  And he&rsquo;ll be on McL Group for as long as he wants because he&rsquo;s been there for a very long time.</p>
<p>I wish he would be more strident, and I get conflicting &#8220;read between the lines&#8221; clues that he might or might not actually be One Of Us, but even if he is, he knows that if he shows it, his minuscule media exposure will become no media exposure.</p>
<p>At that, most of conservative talk radio has blacklisted him.  The host born Michael Alan Weiner has disowned PJB, when he used to have him on as a guest frequently, because Dr. Weiner can think of nothing but re-fighting WWII in the European theater every day, and takes offense to PJB&rsquo;s less than conventional reading of history from that time period and place.  Mark Levin has never had anything to do with PJB, for much the same reason.  AMAF, Levin openly bashes Weiner (they occupy the same daily time slot, so of course they bash each other a lot) for ever giving PJB the time of day.  Rush Limbaugh has rarely mentioned PJB since he officially bolted the Stupid Party in 1999, taking the occasion of their debate on Rush&rsquo;s show in October of that year to make the official break.  The only big name national conservative radio talker who has him on frequently anymore is Weiner&rsquo;s TRN stablemate, Laura Ingraham.</p>

The Republican Party exists in order to advance the economic interests of the richest ten percent of the country.  If you keep that in mind, you will never be surprised by what the GOP does (as opposed to what Republicans say).<br>
 <br>
A high rate of immigration means higher prices, lower wages, and higher profits.  </p>

<p>  Why do they ignore Pat, because he is basically persona non grata to our privileged elites. They acquiesce Pat, as a representative of Paleoconservativism, so that they can say, rather hypocritically, that all viewpoints are tolerated. In reality, everything is under control by our corporate/ultra-liberal media, who limit access to the media channels of power.</p>

Last time I saw him on a cable news &#8216;crosstalk&rsquo; type news show, a year ago or so maybe, he completely destroyed his liberal counterpart. The shows moderator had to take her side just to make it seem fair and balanced. It was not on Fox. </p>
