			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Theunis Bates, AOL News, November 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 15-year-old British girl has been arrested on suspicion of inciting religious hatred after she allegedly set fire to an English-language copy of the Koran and posted footage of the incident on Facebook.</p>
<p>The unidentified teenager is accused of torching the Islamic holy book at her school in Sandwell, near the city of Birmingham in central England, as other students watched. She was questioned by police on Friday and was released later that day pending further inquiries.</p>
<p>Police also arrested a 14-year-old boy on Tuesday on suspicion of making threats on the social networking site, in connection with the alleged burning. He has also been released on bail pending further inquiries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under British law, if an adult is found guilty of religious hatred  &mdash;  something no one has been convicted of since the law was introduced in 2006  &mdash;  they can face up to seven years in prison, a fine or both. {snip}<br>

		<p>No one deserves to be punished just for burning a book. She should have been aware of the consequences though. I doubt anything would have happened if she burnt a Bible. </p>

<p>Its hard to imagine no one has been arrested under that religious hatred law considering how much religious hatred moslems spew.</p>

<p>What, inciting hatred of Christians? In this crazy, topsy-turvy world, that&rsquo;s the only kind of hatred her act aroused.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to get real. At least about something. </p>

		<p>The Brits are completely out of their minds. So, this White British girl burned her copy of the Koran. So what? It was her property, to do what she wanted to do with it. </p>
<p>Muslims destroy Christian Churches, burn Bibles, kill people they find with Bibles, accusing them of spreading that dreaded Christianity among the brain dead Muslim populations. Muslims burn our flags, too, but that seems to be alright, because they are doing it. </p>
<p>Muslims just recently murdered 60 Iraqi Catholics in Baghdad, while the Priest was saying Mass. So, where is the world outrage?! Nowhere, as usual. Visit www.tfp.org . </p>
<p>In Austia, there is an &#8220;Art&#8221; display by an Austrailian &#8220;Artist&#8221; who wrapped the Statue of the Virgin Mary in a condom. Where are the cries and charges of &#8220;Hate Crimes&#8221; against Catholics, and Christians in general? Nowhere! The silence is deafening. </p>
<p>Of course, you can read about this blasphemy of the Blessed Mother at America Needs Fatima www.anf.org,because you won&rsquo;t hear about it anywhere else. Naturally. </p>

		<p>Considering what that book says about women in general, and the Kaffir woman in particular, it&rsquo;s not hard to see how she might object very strongly to what it contains. </p>
<p>Ironic she was arrested on suspicion of &#8220;inciting religious hatred&#8221;. Surely the only people she might incite would be those fans of the book, who it seems hardly need inciting to anything. Many of its adherents already demonstrate that they are full to overflowing with hatred for the &#8220;Kaffir&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The chapter on the Koran and Moslem women gives us some idea on Islam&rsquo;s injunctions on Moslem women. They should cover their bodies from head to foot. Khomeini&rsquo;s Iran forces the women to go under the &#8216;chador&rsquo;. They must not go outside to work where other men might see them. </p>
<p>The non-Moslem or kafir women are to be handled differently, as the Islamic codes are not birding on them. The kafir women are considered to be the property of Moslems; they are their &#8216;slaves&#8221; and the wife or daughter of a &#8216;zimmi&rsquo; can be molested by a Moslem with impunity in a Moslem state ruled by the &#8216;Sharia&rsquo; or Islamic jurisprudence. The idea comes from the treatment meted out to kafir women who were captured in the battlefield. The first fifth of all booty went to the prophet or the caliph or whoever happened to hold the position of the amir-ul-mominin. It could be the Moslem king of the land or even a petty chieftain. This so called leader &#8216;examined&rsquo; all booty, inspected and sometimes &#8216;felt&rsquo; by touching it. The women, all of them were paraded in front of the leader, naked or scantily clad, so that the leader could make his choice.&#8221;</p>

Ooops! Typo! They forgot the most important part   &mdash;   the disclaimer that should have gone at the end:</p>
<p>Under British law, if an adult is found guilty of religious hatred [&hellip;] they can face up to seven years in prison, a fine or both   &mdash;   <i>but only if they&rsquo;re white and Christian.</i></p>

		<p>It will not be long before the white British are extinct.</p>
<p>The current crop of judges, politicians and other community leaders of white ancestry will carry on until the muslims take over political and legal control.  Then they will be booted.</p>
<p>I hope to live to see the day when the British parliament is dissolved and replaced by a full muslim legal and political framework.</p>
<p>I wonder what will be the legal status of all the Britsh infidels at that time.  Will they be elegible for all the current social benefits.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t think they will have any rights or benefits and will either die off naturally or be exterminated.</p>

<p>  I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that many of the Pakistani gang rapists in the article &#8220;An Asian gang of &lsquo;sexual predators&rsquo; cruised city streets for girls as young as 12 &mdash; usually white &mdash; who were then plied with drink and drugs and raped or abused&#8221; recieve prison sentences shorter than this 15-year old girl, who did a stupid immature act on Facebook. </p>

		<p>It seems those sorry dhimmies are not even familiar with sharia law.(neither is that 14 year-old issuing threats. Shame on you, Mustafa!)<br>
An &#8220;English language&#8221; Koran is not a Koran at all. The word of the Prophet (PBUHN) is to be tradited ONLY in the original.</p>

		<p>Islam does not respect democracy or freedom of speech. The fact that burning the Quran can provoke death threats is proof that Islam is not a peaceful or a tolerant religion. </p>
<p>Although burning the Quran may be likely to inflame violence freedom of speech is a cherished western ideal. I say leave the British girl alone and arrest any Muslims threatening her over the incident! Some good may come of this if her actions flush out violent Muslims for the police to arrest.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should all consider burning the Quran in solidarity with this persecuted young lady. I say we make her a martyr for the cause if she is put on the choping block.<br>
