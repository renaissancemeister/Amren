<h1>Democrats Give Charlie Rangel Standing Ovation</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Hayward, Human Events, December 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On November 16, 2006, incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared, &#8220;This leadership will create the most honest, most open, and most ethical Congress in history.&#8221;</p>
<p>A prominent member of her caucus, Representative Charlie Rangel of New York, aggressively sold his political influence for money. He abused government resources, including House personnel and free postal privileges, to solicit campaign donations. He cheated on his taxes, failing to report some of his income. He filed &#8220;incomplete and inaccurate&#8221; financial disclosures.</p>
<p>Yesterday, December 2, 2010, after ethics hearings that lasted years and cost our heavily indebted government considerable amounts of time and money, the House of Representatives voted 333-79 to censure Rangel. Rangel expressed his contempt for these hearings by walking out of them. How much jail time will this felon receive? None at all. &#8220;Censure&#8221; means he just has to stand there and listen while the House expresses its displeasure. Even this ridiculously mild &#8220;penalty&#8221; was too much for 146 of his colleagues, who wanted to downgrade it to a quiet reprimand {snip}.</p>
<p>The Democrats then gave Rangel a standing ovation, causing numerous Republican campaign consultants to think about using the footage during the 2012 elections, and faint dead away.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rangel and some of his defenders characterized his tax cheating as a &#8220;mistake,&#8221; thus assuming their listeners are complete imbeciles. Rangel chaired the panel that writes tax laws. He under-reported his income by hundreds of thousands of dollars for a decade. He was eventually compelled to pay federal and state treasuries $16,000 in back taxes, with absolutely no penalty or interest. Republican John Carter of Texas introduced a bill called the &#8220;Rangel Rule&#8221; to extend this penalty-free privilege to all taxpayers in 2009, but of course it went nowhere.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rangel&rsquo;s defenders, sadly including a number of Republicans, cite his Korean War military service as a reason to excuse his crimes. Rangel himself loudly makes this argument at every opportunity, He did it again during the House procedure yesterday, as well as once again violating House rules by shamelessly using photos of fallen veterans from New York City next to the door of his office as political props.</p>

<p>It could just as well have been a sock puppet appearing before kongress.  As long as it had a black face, the Democrats would have worn out their hands applauding.</p>
<p>As for the few RINO Republicans who did likewise, well, this episode needs to be publicized all over again, come next election.<br>

		<p>Rep. John Lewis, the African American civil rights icon, set Rangel up as a civil rights hero during the hearings.  Talked about not knowing the charges, but that Rangel was in Selma marching across the bridge (i.e. trespassing).</p>
<p>Now Rangel will get rich from all the books and speaking.  Whites will be forced to invite him to come and give lectures and pay him big fees.  Any who resist will be attacked as raciss.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a shakedown scam. One day, White Humanity will say the best word we know: &#8220;NO!&#8221;</p>

<p>I just read today where other abuses and crimes have been uncovered involving him, so I guess they&rsquo;ll just have give him another standing O, as soon as he&rsquo;s tried and convicted again.</p>
<p>The entire lot of them are morons of the highest order.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll bet Wesley Snipes would loved to have been censured rather than doing time in the slammer. How does Rangel escape the &#8220;justice&#8221; meeted out to regular folks? Are Congressional criminals exempt from the law? Snipes had three years back taxes unpaid I belive, while ol&rsquo; Charlie has made &#8220;mistakes&#8221; for seventeen years.</p>

		<p>Given the nature of Rangel&rsquo;s&rsquo;s crimes, how could anybody have the sheer, almost stupefying gall, to claim that &#8220;censure&#8221; (whatever that means) is too severe a penalty?</p>
<p>If any of us had been guilty of the tax evasion felonies Rangel committed we&rsquo;d be on our way to Federal prison to find ourselves &#8220;married&#8221; to about twenty black inmates.</p>

		<p>The CBC is acting like censure is such a harsh punishment that actually carrying it out was a travesty.  When it reality, censure is nothing more than a hard slap on the hand.  Many of these same CBC members wanted to censure President Clinton for committing felony perjury instead of impeaching him.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney in New York will do nothing to Rangel, because the U.S. Attorney is an Obamaite.  And Rangel easily beat Adam Clayton Powell IV in the primary back in August, so Rangel is home free.  Any chance truly to punish him is now gone.</p>

		<p>Maybe they were just clapping for Rangel, for having the courage to  withstand the white man&rsquo;s attempt to discredit this fine upstanding black man, who is simply  about the people&rsquo;s buisness. I heard a rumor that they broke out into song singing &#8220;We Shall Overcome&#8221;, but I could be wrong about that.</p>

		<p>Typical of them to close ranks and protect one of their own. They act like they are immune to laws that apply to the rest of us. Rangle has proved himself to be a dishonest career politician. He should do time like all criminals.</p>

		<p>To no one&rsquo;s surprise, the 79 Congressmen who voted not to censure Rangel<br>
 were all his soul brothers and sisters, Democrat Latino reps and New York Jews like Jerrold Nadler.</p>
<p>Two Republicans, Young (AK) and King (NY) voted against censure. That surprised me.</p>
