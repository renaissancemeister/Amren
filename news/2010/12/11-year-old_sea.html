<h1>11-Year-Old Seattle Boy to Face Prosecution in String of Alleged Crimes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Sullivan, Seattle Times, December 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An 11-year-old boy who was wounded by gunfire during an alleged robbery attempt aboard a Metro bus in August will face prosecution in connection with that incident and two others, a judge has decided.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s lawyer, Dennis L. McGuire, said he expects the boy will plead guilty to reduced charges during the upcoming hearing, but the details are being negotiated.</p>
<p>Deputy Prosecutor Jennifer Worley said that if the boy pleads guilty to all of the charges, he faces between about 10 and 20 months in a juvenile facility when he is sentenced.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Seattle boy was 10 at the time of the crimes he&rsquo;s accused of committing. The Times generally does not name juveniles accused of crimes.</p>
<p>The boy and his two half-brothers, ages 12 and 14, were charged with first-degree attempted robbery in the Aug. 17 incident aboard a Metro bus. Seattle police say the younger boy allegedly ordered a 17-year-old boy to empty his pockets and was accidentally shot during a scuffle on Route 7.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 11-year-old boy was also charged in a robbery aboard a Metro bus on June 5 in which a man&rsquo;s earring was stolen.</p>
<p>He was also charged in the theft of bicycles outside the Levi&rsquo;s Store in downtown Seattle on June 24.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>I would absolutely shoot and kill a child threatening me or my loved ones with a gun. A 10-year old who does this is no child, he is a threat to be either eliminated or rendered harmless. I was once about to be threatened by two black juvenile thugs with guns, until I gunned my engine and gave them the choice to either get run over or hit the dirt. Had I had a gun then and if the situation demanded it, I would have shot and killed both of them. Threatening the lives of others is not an act of a child, outside of warfare or law-enforcement doing that is the act of a violent criminal, nothing less. Before they are 18 or 20 years old, they will murder at least one white person, if not several, and they should be locked up in a juvenile detention center until they are 18. Their parents should also be locked up because they are not raising their minor children the way parents are supposed to in a civilized society.</p>

		<p>Must be something in the malt liquor in Seattle. First there was the uproar last week over the video of the four teenage African American women assaulting a pregneant white woman, and now this. For a city that prides itself on being progressive, enlightened, sophisticated, etc. the behavior of African American &#8220;youths&#8221; remains remarkably consistent.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t you just LOVE how the media downplays any violence committed by blacks and minorities.  It wasn&rsquo;t a &#8220;scuffle&#8221;.  The pre-teen thug was pulling a pistol out of his brother&rsquo;s backpack to SHOOT the victim, but shot himself, accidentally, while trying to get it out of the backpack.  Trust me.  He will get more violent and better at this as time goes on.</p>

		<p>Stuff happens all the time on the Metro, always caused by blacks, and most of it never makes the papers.  This is par for the course on King County Metro buses.</p>
<p>It was always an ordeal for me to use the bus, you needed eyes in the back of your head.  Even the bus stops and Park and Rides there aren&rsquo;t safe.<br/>
I&rsquo;ve been threatened by very young blacks who say I &#8220;dissed&#8221; them since I wouldn&rsquo;t give them money (the bus showed up just in time); I&rsquo;ve been nearly trampled in a stampede of people evacuating a Metro when a knife fight amongst blacks broke out; they constantly board the bus and refuse to pay.  To go towards the rear of a Metro bus is dangerous.</p>
<p>Glad I don&rsquo;t live there anymore.</p>

<i>&#8220;Under state law, children between the ages of 8 and 11 are presumed to be incapable of committing a crime unless a judge determines the youth has the &#8220;sufficient capacity to understand the act &hellip; and to know that it was wrong.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t be punished. He&rsquo;ll be sent to juvenile counseling until it&rsquo;s all forgotten and quietly released. In a few years, we&rsquo;ll read about his latest escapades. We&rsquo;ll be told that he re-offended because while he was in treatment, he learned how to be a real criminal by associating with criminals. He&rsquo;s a victim of a criminal justice system that doesn&rsquo;t care about him. Whatever treatment or punishment he receives will only be telling him that he is doomed to be a criminal all his life.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a victim of society and therefore innocent.</p>

		<p>Does anybody feel we should start releasing the names of these juveniles? Perhaps the humiliation of their name being released will wake them up?<br/>
If he is sentenced..how predictable will it be if the sentence goes from 10 and 20 months, to just 2 months? We all know this has happened before&hellip;</p>

		<p>In some segments of the underclass, children are taught at a very young age that theft or &#8220;boosting&#8221; is justified because of slavery &amp; discrimination. I&rsquo;ve seen store security videos where you have three generations of a family, working as a team to shoplift. This is sometimes called &#8220;getting paid.&#8221; It is no mystery that a child raised in such an environment can so easily pick up a gun and transition to armed robbery &amp; even murder. For this child has been taught to believe that all problems are caused by whites. </p>

		<p>Society used to know how to deal with this problem.  Either we adopt the solutions of the past, or we will be living in a new dark age.  Non-blacks who are forced to go into black territory, either because of lack of finances or geography, are going to face constant danger.  The black underclass used to be leery of attacking whites because they clearly understood how severe retribution would be.  Now, our only solution is to stay away from them and secure our homes and vehicles as best we can.  There was a reason police kept strange blacks out of white neighborhoods, and it wasn&rsquo;t because the cops were just hateful.</p>

<p>Not likely. In their twisted world, things like criminal records are a badge of honor. You have education and work experience on your resume; they have babies mommas and felony convictions on theirs. </p>

		<p>Poor Seattle! I&rsquo;m old enough to remember when it was mostly white and much safer than it is today.  Don&rsquo;t you just love white liberals, like those in King County who refuse to see reality for what it is?  The only part of this country which is racially realistic to some extent is the South. Liberals love to call Southerners &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;backward&#8221; because most of us realize what blacks are really like-barely descended from the trees compared to other races. Closer to home, my ultra liberal sister lives in Seattle and may have to deal with their  black-dominated school system since she has young children.  Wonder how long it will be until she wakes up after her kids are exposed to the charms of black youth.  The poster who mentioned that crime for blacks is a way of &#8220;getting paid&#8221; is absolutely right. Blacks will NEVER lose their entitlement mentality until more of us whites say NO MORE! And that goes for their overall rudeness, complete disregard for other people, and obnoxiousness in public places.</p>

<p>You mentioned anti-Southern bigotry and Seattle.  I was listening to NPR (must have been a temporary fit of insanity) around ten years ago.  The City of Seattle was thinking of putting up a dime-a-cup tax on enhanced coffee beverages (e.g. expresso, latte, cappucino), but not coffee itself, to fund early childhood education programs.  (Mainly because a lot of funding from such programs had been diverted to pay for a new football and baseball stadium).  The measure failed at the polls.</p>
<p>NPR interviewed some Seattle residents on the streets.  One woman said words that I&rsquo;ll never forget even if I grow to be an old centenarian with Alzheimer&rsquo;s - &#8220;I don&rsquo;t understand why we have to pay more in taxes for the stuff we like.  Let them filthy rednecks down South in trailer parks pay more in cigarette taxes and use that for our kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>That proved that liberal obsession with tobacco is nothing more than bigotry towards &#8220;lower class&#8221; whites.</p>
