<h1>45 People Lynched Amid Haiti Cholera Fears</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>ninemsn (Sydney), December 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Angry Haitian mobs have lynched at least 45 people in recent weeks, accusing them of spreading a cholera outbreak that has killed over 2500 people across the country, officials said.</p>
<p>The number included at least 14 suspected sorcerers previously known to have been lynched in the far southwestern region of Grand&rsquo;Anse as local people feared they were spreading cholera with a magical substance. The area has been largely spared by the outbreak.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have counted 40 people dead in Grand&rsquo;Anse department alone, where people are attacking natural healers they accuse of cholera-linked witchcraft,&#8221; said communications ministry official Moise Fritz Evens.</p>
<p>Five other people were killed in similar circumstances elsewhere in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The victims  &mdash;  most of them voodoo priests  &mdash;  were stoned or hacked with machetes before being burned in the street,&#8221; added the official, who was presenting the results of an investigation conducted in Grand&rsquo;Anse earlier this month.</p>
<p>Communications minister Marie-Laurence Lassegue said &#8220;voodoo practitioners have nothing to do with the cholera epidemic. We must press for an awareness campaign about the disease in the communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Official figures earlier showed the water-borne bacterial infection has claimed 2591 lives so far in the nation&rsquo;s first cholera outbreak in more than a century.</p>
<p>The disease first appeared in mid-October in the north.</p>
<p>Health ministry figures as of December 17 showed 121,518 people had been treated for the water-borne bacterial infection, including 63,711 who received hospital treatment.</p>
<p>And in a sign there is no end in sight for the disease that has become a thorn in the side of the already deeply troubled nation, about 50 people died on each of the last five days recorded.</p>
<p>At the outbreak&rsquo;s peak in November, there were daily death tolls of 60, 70 and even 80 and above.</p>
<p>The cholera outbreak led to deadly anti-UN riots last month as a desperate populace turned its anger on peacekeepers from Nepal accused of bringing the disease into the country.</p>
<p>The first lynching cases date back to late last month, when mobs hacked or stoned to death their victims.</p>
<p>About half of Haiti&rsquo;s population is believed to practice the voodoo religion in some form, though many are thought to also follow other religious beliefs at the same time.</p>
<p>Sorcery and spiritual magic have been incorporated into some of the beliefs.</p>
<p>Voodoo evolved out of the beliefs that slaves from West Africa brought with them to Haiti.</p>
<p>It is now deeply rooted in Haitian culture.</p>
<p>Evangelical Christian movements however are also making inroads in Haiti, and religious tensions have risen in the wake of January&rsquo;s catastrophic earthquake that killed 250,000 people and left more than one million homeless.<br>

		<p>This story reminds me, although on a much smaller scale, of the 14th century in Europe during the horrible time of the bubonic plague.  Christianity sponsored a number of persecutions against suspected individuals and groups, from individuals being accused of witchcraft to the Jews accused of poisoning wells.  The medieval European mind, injected as it was with Dante&rsquo; style visions of hell combined with a heavy handed control by clergy through fear of their &#8220;loving&#8221; God, sought to appease that God through increased supplications such as the flagellate cults, and holy pilgrimages, where travel was performed on hands and knees.  The primitive mind always resorts to superstition and the inflicting of pain on others, but just as often on oneself.</p>

		<p>This means there have been more lynchings of blacks by other blacks in the western one-third of a Caribbean island in the last number of weeks than there have been in the United States in the entire lifetimes of most people reading these words right now.  But that&rsquo;s not the impression you&rsquo;ll get by reading somebody&rsquo;s &#8220;intelligence reports.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Where&rsquo;s Jesse? Where&rsquo;s Rev. Al? Where&rsquo;s the Southern Poverty Law Center?  They&rsquo;re no where in sight and its because there&rsquo;s no money in it for them. They could care less that those people were lynched, because they were lynched by other blacks.</p>

		<p>It just occurred to me that in the 45 or so years that I&rsquo;ve been paying attention to the news, I can&rsquo;t recall hearing or reading anything good about Haiti. Not once.</p>

		<p>Its always OK for blacks to lynch blacks. </p>
<p>Its OK for blacks to lynch whites or rape,assault, rob, murder etc. </p>
<p>Whites are supposed to ignore the double standard.</p>

		<p>Old White Jim - That&rsquo;s not fair.  The climate&rsquo;s beautiful, the island&rsquo;s picturesque, and the beaches are wonderful.  The only thing wrong with the place is the native population. </p>

		<p>It was fascinating to watch Sarah Palin on TV this week trying hard to spin Haiti for her political benefit.  Not a word about lynchings, of course; just about how we need to do more for them, much more of what has never worked in the past.   </p>
<p>My impression is that, aside from hardcore missionaries (including secular ones), everyone else has written off Haiti &amp; moved on. </p>

<p>NOT since 1964 has there been an authenticated lynching in the U.S. of a black man by a white mob. And in the years prior to that, decades actually, the numbers were scant, from 1930 or so onward about one, two, three a year at most. And in most of those cases, there was some sort of provocation! NOT desirable for a mob to seek &#8220;justice&#8221; by mob rule, but that was the case, and the numbers are miniscule over a period of time compared to what is occurring now in Haiti. Have perspective! I think most of us do already.</p>
<p>[statistice concerning &#8220;lynching&#8221; in the U.S. from the NAACP have to be correct and absolutely accurate too, who would question the NAACP on such a matter?]</p>

<p><br>
Good deeds never go unpunished.  It was the same thing when Pres. Clinton sent soldiers to Somalia to HELP them.  The ingrates attacked and mutilated our troops.  </p>
<p>This shows that the UN, the US, and everyone else should just leave Haiti to its own resources. They don&rsquo;t appreciate  help?  Then don&rsquo;t give them any! It&rsquo;s a bottomless pit.</p>
