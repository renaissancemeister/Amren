			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alvaro Huerta, Press of Atlantic City (Pleasantville, NJ), December 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Republicans managed to defeat the DREAM Act, but it&rsquo;s a victory that will haunt them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Republican Party once again demonstrated its disdain toward one of the most marginalized and vulnerable groups in this country: undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s not forget the Democrats who voted against it. This group included Sens. Max Baucus of Montana, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Jon Tester of Montana.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I had several reservations with this bill, but not the same ones that the senators voting no had.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like the word &#8220;Alien&#8221; in the title; no human being is an alien.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like the fact that it would have induced young brown people to risk their lives in unjust wars like the one President George W. Bush waged in Iraq.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t like the fact that it gave special treatment to those who attend college. An immigrant kid who doesn&rsquo;t go to college still contributes to our society, after all.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the end of the day, while this is a short-term loss for Latinos in this country, in the long term, the Republicans and those conservative Democrats will pay a big price at the ballot box.</p>
<p>The browning of America is a reality that an aging white population needs to come to terms with. {snip}</p>

		<p>Mr. Huerta is wrong.  The illegal aliens are just that-alien to the United States.  They are NOT immigrants. I didn&rsquo;t like the DREAM Act because it would give legal status not only to the illegal alien children but also to their parents/relatives who put them in this position in the first place. So the lawbreakers would get citizenship after all. The dominant &#8220;browning&#8221; of America is only possible because of illegal immigration and our politicians turning a blind eye towards it. Of course, Mr. Huerta loves the &#8220;browning&#8221; of America because it is his own kind that would eventually dominate this country. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Young brown people to risk their lives in unjust wars like the one President George W. Bush waged in Iraq&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Unjust&rsquo; is an opinion made solely based on an emotional response by the author of this drivel. Having spent two years of my life on the streets of Baghdad, I think the wars made perfect sense: Forcing discipline and order on a race of people who need it the most.</p>
<p>And on that note, having served six years in the Army, a vast majority of the &#8220;young brown people&#8221; in the military community do not risk their lives in any fashion; they leverage the military system in order to obtain as much prestige and profit for themselves as they possibly can, much like they do in the civilian world with the current welfare system. In addition, they are exponentially more bigoted, racist and unfair to the whites in their ranks as they claim whites to be. Equal Opportunity is a miserable failure in the Army, and a vast majority of taxpayers in the United States would be appalled at how skewed Military justice has become. Not to mention, allowing so many minorities into positions of power greatly reduces America&rsquo;s ability to maintain the readiness it requires to effectively defend its shore from all enemies, both foreign and abroad. <br>

		<p>Alvaro Huerta is right on schedule reminding Whites of the &#8220;browning&#8221; of this country, otherwise known as White Genocide by race replacement.</p>
<p>An &#8220;aging white population does need to come to terms with those promoting this Genocide.</p>
<p>Genocide tribunals would be a start.   Those in the dock would be the enablers throughout government, media and academia who have not enforced the law, or have changed the law to enable the occupation by swarming to occur.</p>

		<p>The columnist brags that hispanics have a higher birthrate than white Americans.  Does this La Raza devotee understand that the stable society that whites built is allowing hispanics to have several children each?  Does he not understand that whites are supporting their own displacement through generous handouts to blacks and hispanics?  Does he understand that if whites decided to fight back, the mestizo hegemony leftists and La Razaites so relish would be stopped cold?  These arrogant brown people really think that the game is over and they have won, I&rsquo;ve got news for them, it&rsquo;s not going down the way they think.</p>

		<p>What Mr. Huerta &amp; his ilk need to come to terms with is that this country was established and built by white people - specifically white European people. Their culture, their mores, their thoughts, their industry, and the entire reason that this nation has survived and thrived is due to them. </p>
<p>When this nation finally becomes &#8216;browned&rsquo;, it will no longer be the same place. It will no longer be a desirable place. It will be Mexico-norte. When that happens, it will be the same lawless, villainous place that Mexico, the land that most of the &#8216;browns&rsquo; come from, is today. Mr. Huerta might well be sympathetic with these people now, but I wonder how he&rsquo;ll like his newspaper asking the brigands what they want the paper to print. Then, Mr. Huerta, you&rsquo;ll have the &#8220;browning&#8221; that you seek! I fervently hope that you feel its full effects!</p>

		<p>Hey Alvaro, cry me a river.  Firstly it isn&rsquo;t just &#8220;aging whites&#8221; who put conservatives in Congress.  Moreover, I predict that if the new folks actually VOTE conservative and they demand a halt to immigration both legal and illegal, and fund ICE in removing you illegals rather than fund DREAM, they will get even MORE votes next time around.  Blacks hate your being here too, ya know.  Dim as they are, they finally recognize that you are taking THEIR jobs, not mine.  You are taking THEIR places in college, not mine.<br>
You are sucking dry welfare which THEY depend on, not me.  THEY were born here.  You were NOT.  GO HOME.</p>

		<p><i>I didn&rsquo;t like the word &ldquo;Alien&rdquo; in the title; no human being is an alien.</i></p>
<p>Well, he needs to learn how to use a dictionary. He apparently has been watching too many sci-fi movies and thinks the term &#8220;alien&#8221; can only refer to little green men from outer space.</p>
<p><i> The browning of America is a reality that an aging white population needs to come to terms with.<i></i></i></p>
<p>And what exactly is this &#8220;browning of America?&#8221; Is it some natural force, caused when people stay out in the sun too long? </p>
<p>No, of course not! It&rsquo;s a political phenomenon! And who allowed it to happen? Obviously it was the majority white population who allowed the immigration laws to be changed in the first place, and could change them back if it acted in time. </p>
<p>Of course, Hispanic activists and libs want us to think it&rsquo;s inevitable. That&rsquo;s why they always refer to it as such.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for all five of the Democrat Senators that Huerta wants to remember, but I can assure you all that Kay Hagan is far from &#8220;conservative&#8221; as she voted for Obamacare and for a &#8220;Sugarbritches&#8221; military. I just think that her phone rang off the hook with angry old dead White people whose lyin&rsquo; eyes had seen enough in North Carolina of general lawlessness and fiscal crisis brought on by a foreign invasion of third worlders. </p>
<p>Sr. Huerta has just shown his political illiteracy with this nugget.</p>

		<p>I still remember the first time I came across a Hispanic who openly said that this should be a spanish speaking country.  The matter-of-fact way he just came out and said it caused me to be speechless.  </p>
<p>Because he was a &#8216;supervisor&rsquo; (read: affirmative action, patronage appointee) I didn&rsquo;t say any more and just went about my business.</p>
<p>This was about three years ago after I went to work in the city, which much to my surprose, was almost 80% &#8216;brown.&rsquo;  I had no idea urban areas were basically already occupied territory.  </p>
<p>While many latinos I know are nice and even some want to assimilate completely, I fear the masses of amer-indians who know only gang life or very simple village ways.</p>
<p>As other posters have pointed out, the &#8216;browning&rsquo; is happening only with our cooperation, active or passive.  Otherwise there would be no resources to support all those babies.  When America has become a black and brown &#8216;paradise&rsquo; of gang warfare, kidnapping, malnutrition and no jobs, where with the black and brown masses go for their freebies?  Europe will have become a black and brown hellhole by then too!</p>
<p>Hint: China does not want you and will not let you in.</p>

<p>This sentiment demonstrates exactly what is wrong with the White race in America.  The author somehow believes that the destruction he is participating in, against people who did us no harm, is good.  No wonder we cannot get any traction&hellip; there is not enough tread to get a grip.  </p>

		<p>Senor Huerta, let me clarify something for your readers. When you say: &#8220;An immigrant kid who doesn&rsquo;t go to college still contributes to our society, after all.&#8221;  I guess gang-banging and going to jail contributes to society as it helps to employ police, lawyers and prison guards.  <br>

<p>That kind of paternalistic, white supremacist thinking is a large part of what got us into this mess in the first place.  One would have to be extremely foolish and naive to believe that the Iraq war &#8220;forced discipline&#8221; on people who &#8220;need&#8221; it.  With so many people like that in our race, it&rsquo;s no wonder the neocons manipulate us to serve their interests so easily.  <br>

		<p>I love the stuff he said about &#8220;the browning&#8221; of America, because older White Baby Boomers have not been having enough children to replace themselves.  But he has NOT been paying attention younger White people.  And where a Boomer with two children was considered to have a large family, I am seeing young White families with four and five children of their own. </p>
<p>Second of all, he is too arrogant and stupid to recognize that these &#8220;undocumented immigrants&#8221; are here at White America&rsquo;s sufferance.  We don&rsquo;t have to forcibly eject any of them.  All we have to do is make it impossible for them to live here.  Make it illegal to hire and house them.  Cut off all welfare benefits.  Demand proof or citizenship from everyone who is arrested and if they don&rsquo;t have proper documentation put their happy little brown behinds on a chain gang for one to five years depending on whether they are a repeat offender or not.</p>
<p>If the Democrats didn&rsquo;t find a way to pass this DREAM act or some other form of Comprehensive Amnesty when we had the most leftist Democrat in the White House ever complete with a supermajority of Democrats in Congress and a handful of go-along-to-get-along RINOs like McCain and Graham, it is highly unlikely that they are going to get anywhere in 2012 when even more pro-enforcement candidates are voted in.  I think even the Democrats have figured out that Mestizos have this nasty habit of voting in their own once they achieve demographics even against non-Mestizos who have pandered to the in the past.  </p>
<p>Barak Obama has his faults.  He may not like White people, but he is first and foremost a Black Advocate who will never ever allow his race to take a back seat to a bunch of Mestizos who could have gotten free college back home.</p>

		<p>In California there is a high rate of lower class white and Hispanic intermarriage.  Many other states I&rsquo;m sure are like this or will be like this.  </p>
<p>The effect of this trend will be &#8220;acceptance&#8221; that America is browning because so many people will have some Hispanic ancestry.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect the same thing to happen between blacks and whites in this country although the same high level of intermarriage is happening in Briton between whites and Caribbean blacks. </p>

		<p>This sounds like a last gasp to me. These people know their own countries don&rsquo;t want them, nor do we. It seems they think it&rsquo;s a God-given right to invade other countries and whine, demand, march, wave their foreign flags and feel entitled to whatever anyone else can be forced to give them. They are common criminals who bring their corrupt and lawless mindsets with them. Every day we read of the murders, rapes, molestatons and other crimes committed by these invaders. Hopefully, our new Congress will announce that the US is no longer the dumping ground of the world and we will not tolerate a nation of undesirables.</p>

		<p>#2 overseas! I read what you wrote about the U.S. military and you are correct on every point, you left out the HUGE numbers of black officers, many of field grade,something never before seen much of as they are mostly incompetent and no matter the commission they are still ghetto types in most cases. I hate to see the current crop of general officers kissing black muslim a$$ and being PC about it. Officers like McChrystal (sp) are few and far between and we know what the Obamaster did to him. Our military is finished with the exception of the almost totally white special ops units of the various branches of services.</p>

 Honestly, I can`t think of a more insidious waste of our countrymen. Fighting to what?!?! Teach, give, show them democracy?!? What for?!? Who cares?!? I think we should be arming each side and let them kill each other. It would be more cost effecient, keep them busy and us uninvolved&hellip; </p>

		<p>&ldquo;The browning of America is a reality that an aging white population needs to come to terms with. {snip}&rdquo;</p>
<p>When in history has such a stubborn populace ever just sat back and accepted a third world invasion? In addition, there is a major assumption in the Hispanic community that the White community is only made up of senior citizens, which they are heavily mistaken. A great deal of the white racialist movement is made up of younger people (including myself) who will never &ldquo;come to terms&rdquo; with the invasion of our lands. </p>
<p>Sometimes Hispanics use the &ldquo;white people are dying&rdquo; idea as a sort of manifest destiny for their destruction of our country. They believe that it is their &ldquo;destiny&rdquo; to come and do what the old whites are no longer able to do. They are sorely mistaken. Right now, the white community is passive and soft, but once the fat is trimmed from our race, will they realize what monster they have awoken? <br>

		<p>[b]&#8221;2, Overseas, wrote &lsquo;Unjust&rsquo; is an opinion made solely based on an emotional response by the author of this drivel. Having spent two years of my life on the streets of Baghdad, I think the wars made perfect sense: Forcing discipline and order on a race of people who need it the most.&#8221; [/b]</p>
<p>You may not be aware of it, but according to the US census the population of Iraq is White/Caucasian. Because the US census has counted millions of non white caucasians into the white &#8220;majority&#8221; it follows that the white majority in the USA is imaginary, the 50% crossover point is happening about right now and not in 2042 or 2050 according to my estimations. Do you think the general societal dysfunction that is exposed as the tide of easy credit recedes is some kind of random happening? </p>
<p>Miscegenation between whites and non white caucasians is also not reflected in the statistics. Judging from what I have seen firsthand, such offspring takes after their nonwhite parent in looks as well as mentality. White behaviour as well as looks is obviously dependent on recessive genes. Jim Crow obviously knew what he was talking about.  </p>

		<p>Mr. Huerta is right.  Ultimately whites will give in, like the parent who will not slap down an arrogant child until they eventually grow tired of the constant cajoling and begging for a toy or privilege.</p>
<p>Because the psychology is now one of saying no because it&rsquo;s rude to ask rather than NO! because we are white and our racial identity and hardwon perks are more important than acknowledging brown &#8216;humanness&rsquo;, as the right thing to maintain.</p>
<p>In this, Mr. Huerta&rsquo;s desire to relabel Illegals as other than &#8216;alien&rsquo; finds it&rsquo;s true meaning: as long as they remain outsiders the whiff white racial collectivism will stand against them.  And those in power can easily contrive to keep them voting liberally by making it clear that ONLY through them does the power to change society exist at all, at a local level, with slow growth.</p>
<p>And that is something that I think hispanics and white democrats are beginning to realize will not stand the test of time, from both sides, as each looks to steal what is left before there is nothing left at all.</p>
<p>Slow leads to massive compression of the remaining white majority which rapidly becomes an impenetrable wall.  Yet slow is also the only way a politician can sell out his nation (i.e. his _people_) and live long enough, well enough, to enjoy it.  </p>
<p>For as soon as they are not illegal, &#8216;browns&rsquo; will chain migrate and reproduce at a level compareable to or exceeding the 4.4 TFR in 1986 California.  And when everyone comes of age and are unconstrained in how they vote and for whom, that will be the end of white liberal influence through vote pandering.</p>
<p>You can thank the Tea Party for that much.</p>
<p>I also agree with the man who said the Iraqis needed to be spanked, but not for the assumptive reason that it will make them a better people.  Rather because Islam&rsquo;s standing, would have have suffered a tremendous drop in the eyes of it&rsquo;s adherents had we simply said: &#8220;NO, Iraq is ours.&#8221;  Good, bad or indifferent, our strategy of accepting a bloody nose in trade for owning an oill rich, secular, Arab state would have been seen in much the same way we Marshall Plan dominated Europe.</p>
<p>And the rest of the Middle East would have looked like fools for inviting us in to begin with.  This would have brought governments crashing down and possibly even seen the final humiliation of Islam as the bandit religion &#8216;out robbered&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Add in the 40 billion in known petroleum reserves and 20 in unexploiteds that Iraq (and the French) now again own, we would have gained a tremendous lever in controlling the flagrant price &#8216;speculation&rsquo; which was and is now destroying our society as punishment for daring retaliation over 9/11.</p>
<p>Having lost all of that, I think the U.S. military has now proven it is useless and could and should be brought home from not just AfG (which is a worthless hole) but also Korea and Europe, to be reduced in size by 60%.  So that it cannot be used against the U.S. Population.</p>
<p>Four iterations of Bottom Up Reviews didn&rsquo;t correctly resize our military after the Cold War and staying, uselessly, in the Gulf for ten years, was part of what kept the military so fat, based on a hollow threat.</p>
<p>Perhaps the sight of society disintegrating before their unemployed eyes might make the overwhelmingly white combat forces coming home more cognizant of the &#8216;discipline&rsquo; needed right here and more likely to choose the correct side when Secession is the only chance to save what&rsquo;s left of what&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Certainly, if you are facing a 13 trillion dollar deficit, growing approximately 2 trillion a year, dropping a 388 billion dollar F-35 fighter program makes a lot more sense than refusing to help out states who have been living on a war economic footing, without federal matching funds in nearly every area, running their coffers dry, while we piddled around in Southwest Asia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to look inside and decide, not whom we hold responsible for this mess we&rsquo;re in.  But whether we want to continue to associate with them as we pry ourselves loose.</p>
<p>And the answer to that, for me, is _live well_, as the ultimate vengeance.  So that the proof of white superiority, in our own societies, is the survival of a cadre element of us, while the rest of America &#8216;browns out&rsquo; into an oblivion of Mexican Village existence.</p>

		<p>It hurts me to say this but what has a beginning has an end.<br>
This browning of America as they call it, could easily be The Beginning Of The End?<br>
I can&rsquo;t say this without sounding racist, but then again isn&rsquo;t anything negative said about anyone who is non white considered racist today.<br>
All anyone has to do is look at Mexico and some of these other countries to see what these people do to a country and a government in short time.<br>
They come because they think America&rsquo;s wealth comes from the land BUT in reality it comes from the people and I am not speaking of the low life invaders we are experiencing in America today. But how can it be any different when we have a man at the helm who couldn&rsquo;t run a successful candy store and elected official who rob us blind then laugh as they spit on our face.<br>
I wish this would turn around but I have a strong feeling it won&rsquo;t Oh Well it was nice as long as it lasted.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t grok your point.  Are you saying that Iraqis needed discipline, or that Hispanics in the military needed discipline?  Either way, that&rsquo;s not supposed to be the function of the American Armed Forces.  And it should be noted that Iraqis were plenty disciplined under the Saddam regime.  I am of the mind that Arabs need at least a mild form of despotism in order to have semi-functional societies, and should the despot be a secular Muslim, like Saddam Hussein was, all the better for us.</p>

		<p>The earlier posters were right: this is a threat.  So we should punished for defending ourselves?  Well, if we are going to be taken over and displaced regardless of whether cater to hispanics and blacks, might as well fight them.</p>

		<p>Mexican racists sneer at us, that they are growing in numbers and there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about it. Other than a civil war, that is true. However, we are forgetting one important force, nature. Nature has a way of thinning out herds when they begin to abuse morality and destroy the environment. These invaders are prone to extreme violence and unprotected, uninibited fornication. Bascially, they will kill each other with violence and AIDS. There is no pronounced gay community amongst the illegals, other than the obvious hairdresser types. The homosexuals feel they have to act macho, have sex with women, make babies, etc. Like blacks, they are on the down low, and have clandestive unsafe sex with other men. They then give AIDS to their wives and unborn children. This is spreading like wildfire, my doctor in California informed me of this. More often, the heterosexuals catch AIDS in prison and jails, and then give it to their wives and girlfriends when released. The welfare system provides them with some medication, but that is drying up as the healthcare system becomes bankrupt. If it is not AIDS, then it will be something else. Nature keeps mutating new diseases, and these men will never be able to control their urges. </p>
<p>As far as violence, we all know about the horrific gang violence that keeps getting worse.  </p>
<p>Their communities will thrive as long as we allow them to. When we take away the handouts and force them to support themselves, they will either go elsewhere or die off.</p>
