<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-politics/20101229/US.Indian.Affairs.Dorgan/">Retiring Senator Spurs Action on Indian Issues</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Daly, Comcast News, December 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After years of trying, Congress passed several landmark bills for Indians, including laws overhauling tribal health care and law enforcement and settling a 15-year legal battle over lost royalties for mismanaged Indian lands.</p>
<p>Congress continued parceling out $2.5 billion in economic stimulus money to tribes and resolved four long-standing water disputes totaling more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>Tribal leaders and advocates call the two-year session that ended last week the most productive for American Indians in four decades. They offer several reasons, including strong support from the Obama administration, which has made tribal issues a priority.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dorgan, a Democrat [North Dakota&rsquo;s Byron Dorgan], announced last January he wouldn&rsquo;t seek re-election after almost 30 years in Congress. Dorgan, chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, said he then &#8220;focused like a laser&#8221; on unfinished business, including the long-stalled bills on health care and crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jacqueline Johnson Pata, executive director of the National Congress of American Indians, the oldest and largest Indian organization in the nation, said Dorgan&rsquo;s pending retirement spurred action.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The health care law, formally known as the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, was included in the larger health care overhaul passed by Congress last spring. It clears the way for more preventive care, boosts mental health resources and addresses recruiting and retaining physicians throughout Indian Country. It also focuses on teen suicide  &mdash;  an epidemic on many reservations  &mdash;  and improves treatment for diabetes, another chronic problem.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dorgan also championed the Tribal Law and Order Act, which aims to give tribes more authority to combat crime on their reservations.</p>
<p>The measure authorizes more federal law enforcement officers and makes federal agencies collect data on crimes committed in Indian Country. It also requires the Justice Department to maintain criminal data on cases that U.S. attorneys decline to prosecute for various reasons, including a lack of evidence. A recent report found that federal officials decline to prosecute more than 50 percent of violent crimes on reservations.</p>
<p>On some reservations, fewer than a dozen officers patrol areas the size of Connecticut.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Congress approved $3.4 billion to settle the lost royalties case, which covers claims that Native Americans were swindled out of payments for oil, gas, timber and grazing rights for more than a century. As many as 500,000 American Indians will receive at least $1,500 apiece; some will get significantly more.</p>
<p>A total of $2 billion will be used to buy broken-up Indian lands from individual owners willing to sell, with the lands turned over to tribes. Another $60 million will go to a scholarship fund for young Indians.</p>
<p>The settlement was reached in late 2009, but was not approved by Congress until the lame-duck session that ended just before Christmas.</p>
<p>A separate settlement with the Agriculture Department will pay Indian farmers $680 million for improper denial of farm loans. The settlements and new laws, Dorgan said, are a matter of honor.</p>

		<p>Really, having an Indian Territory was a great idea. The greed of settlers and oil interests to push the resettled Indians aside in OK should have been ignored. Maybe parts of N.Texas should have been added on, along with bits of Kansas and New Mexico. Then you could have just ignored these people. Left them to their own unsubsidized devices. By now, most would have followed to the big hunt in sky  the vast populations of &#8216;native americans&rsquo; who never made it out of the era prior to white settlement. </p>
<p>There are genetic problems with these folks, colorful as some of them are. If some assimilate, as many did for 200 yrs, fine, but the rest are quite useless. As our European ancestors quite correctly ascertained 500 yrs ago.</p>

<p>Sixty years ago, productivity was defined by manufacturing or agricultural productivity.  Today &#8220;Productivity&#8221; is defined by how much money you get from the government.  </p>

		<p>As much as I resent the idea that it is okay to profit off of the real or imagined suffering of others, it just seems more equitable to give more consideration to Indians, who were already here, and lost lives and land,than some immigrant who randomly decided to show up.</p>

		<p>from what I saw most of the so called &#8220;indians&#8221; were just mexicans playing &#8220;indian&#8221; to get big money handouts</p>

Nonwhite assimilation leads to genetic assimilation which leads to white extinction. It&rsquo;s baizzar how many people who post here want nonwhite assimilation. Isn&rsquo;t the bottom line the survival of the white race? There are a lot of Americans who are to some percent American Indian and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s good.</p>

		<p>I also am not opposed in principle to giving some redress to the Indians.  They were definitely more noble than any Africans brought here, and they often put up one heck of a fight.  I just want to know that after giving back some land here and there, some more tribal authority and a few freebies that they will leave the rest of us alone after that and not come back in 20 years asking for more.</p>
<p>Get a job.  Go to college.  Do something.  Heck, you can even wear your traditional costumes to work if you want!  Just don&rsquo;t get on the shakedown bandwagon.  Give respect to your ancestors!</p>

		<p>American Indians that I know and talk to that come from the various &#8220;nations&#8221; and reservations always talk and brag about the treaties their tribes made with the US, stating that the US must stick to it&rsquo;s agreements and such. I respond by asking that is fine but why are you always pandering and asking for anything more? Isn&rsquo;t a treaty a treaty? They see it as a stopping ground to have to be on equal terms with us or to concede anything else, but they also see it as a vehicle to constantly single themselves out for more freebies. </p>
<p>The problem is they want to pretend they are a distinct &#8220;culture&#8221; but they really have no means to do anything even on the distant level of western civilization, which they secretly and not so secretly covet beyond imagination&hellip; even with all the subsidies and handouts and information they are constantly given with open arms. They live as a third world enclave no matter what we do or sacrifice for them. Yet they still brag&hellip; about what, is there something to be impressed with here?</p>
<p>You made your deals to be free&hellip; then be free and stay out of our pockets forever.</p>

		<p>Used to teach on an Indian reservation. Grants for land, for houses, complete free college educations&hellip;.but it was still like a ghetto   &mdash;   beat-up motor homes,trash, and pit bulls everywhere. And honestly, the last thing they want is more law enforcement on their land. Remember the Leonard Peltier case?</p>
<p>For the most part, there&rsquo;s a real sense of superiority among the people. And the school was horrible   &mdash;   tribal reps attending every behavior meeting to be sure the kids never saw any consequences.</p>
<p>The other day, I read the pages of newly-passed gov&rsquo;t programs that included these grants and settlements. All the bills were listed alphabetically, and about every fifth one was &#8220;The Native Peoples&rsquo;&#8221; this or that. BO recently signed a new agreement with the U.N. promising development and money to &#8220;the indigenous peoples of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gets credit for being &#8220;black,&#8221; but with his Kenyan background, I&rsquo;d say his heart really lies with the indigenous. It&rsquo;s the ol&rsquo; anti-colonialism that goes along with him hating the first world and transferring all he can to the third.</p>
