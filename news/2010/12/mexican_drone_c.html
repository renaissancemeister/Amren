<h1>Mexican Drone Crashes in El Paso</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Star-Telegram (Fort Worth), December 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Mexican government official said Friday that a small drone that crashed in El Paso had been flying over Mexican airspace but that a malfunction forced controllers to bring it down across the border.</p>
<p>He said it belonged to the Mexican federal police and had been on a routine patrol.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.S. is known to use drones to patrol the border, but this is thought to be the first time that a Mexican drone has been reported operating at the border.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the developer, it is designed for use in military and Homeland Security missions.<br>

		<p>In case no one else says it, I will.</p>
<p>This is a million dollar piece of hardcore military hardware.  NO police department of any country, let alone Mexico, could afford these.</p>
<p>Obviously, they obtained these from the US military, fresh off operations in the middle east.</p>
<p>This says two things that are not common knowledge.  There is war in Mexico.  And the US is involved in that war&hellip;..secretly.</p>
<p>Should the US be involved?  I would argue yes.  More than that, I think we should disengage from the middle east and redeploy along our own border&hellip;.since the situation is so serious.</p>
<p>But it should not be secret.  The US is a democracy (for now), not an dictatorship.  Decisions like going to war are not made by King Obama. They are made by an elected Congress according to the will of our population.</p>
<p>The US has slid quite far down a slippery slope indeed&hellip;.both in what we allowed Bush to do and what Obama is not even bothering to ask us to do.</p>

		<p>One can only surmise that the unmaned aircraft was funded by the Vato Guvimint to contol the flow of south bound Hondurans, Guatemalans, and Salvadorans throuth sovereign Vato Territorio.</p>

		<p>This is probably an American built drone, passed on to the &#8220;legitimate&#8221; (insert laugh tracks here) Mexican authorities under the Merida Initative.  What it proves is that drones don&rsquo;t make crime any better.  They are good for lining the pockets of certain industries.</p>

		<p>Investment guru Jim Powell has been recommending stock in the Harris Corporation for several year now. Harris makes drones for military use and for use inside the US as well.</p>
<p><i>The drones, as they are usually called, are extremely sophisticated. Most of them, such as the updated Predator and its successor the Reaper, are operated remotely from half way around the world&hellip;.Many other drones are fully automated.</i>  </p>
<p><i>The latest drones are no larger than model airplanes&hellip;. One electric drone being tested is no bigger than a robin. The &#8216;bird&rsquo; is completely silent. You would not want one coming after you.</i></p>
<p><i>Even large drones can now be made nearly invisible&hellip; Unofficially the new aircraft are called &#8216;noseeums.&rsquo; Some are intended to be used inside America</i></p>

<p>Since 2006, Charles Rangel has been promoting a reinstitution of the extremely unpopular military draft.  You can be sure neither he nor his loved ones will be subjected to being shipped 9,000 miles away into an unwinnable War, a meat grinder in Afghanistan, Pakistan or Iran, said Rangel:</p>
<p><i>What it does is make everyone between the ages of 18 and 42, whether they be men or women, straight or gay, to have the opportunity to defend this great country whenever the President truly believes our national security is threatened</i></p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2f9rnp5" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2f9rnp5</a></p>
<p>Rangel imagines himself and obama as the determiners of whether &#8216;national security is threatened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As a military draft remains unpopular, the threat of fragging high, War, will by necessity, become increasingly unmanned and mechanized.</p>
<p>As for the Harris Corporation, Jim Powell states:</p>
<p><i>At the time I recommended Harris it was selling for $33.37. It is now $50.42, a 51.1% gain in six months. The company is profitable and it pays a dividend. I think Harris is still a buy for long term accounts.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather invest in the Harris Corporation than invest one of my loved ones.</p>
