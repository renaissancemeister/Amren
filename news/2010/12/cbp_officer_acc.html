<h1>CBP Officer Accused of Alien-Smuggling Denied Bond</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Monica Balderrama, KFOX-TV (El Paso), December 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Ricardo Manuel Cordero, 48, and his lawyer asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Richard Mesa to set a bond so Cordero could get a chance to be with his family. But, Mesa granted a request from federal prosecutors that Cordero stay in jail after listening to evidence of the alleged acts.</p>
<p>A Special CBP Agent with Internal Affairs, Jesus Lowenberg testified that from Sept. to Dec. 2010, Cordero and another man, Jaime Sergio Quintana, 40, facilitated the crossing of undocumented immigrants into the U.S.</p>
<p>Lowenberg testified that {snip} on Oct. 28, Quintana met the informant and an undocumented immigrant on the south side of the Bridge of the Americas. The three approached the pedestrian crossing where Cordero was assigned to that day and was able to facilitate the crossing of the immigrant. He testified that the informant paid $5,000 in advance.</p>
<p>Lowenberge also testified that the second crossing happened on Dec. 9 and that the informant was asked to pay $6.500.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lowenberge also testified that Cordero has two birth certificates, one from El Paso County and another from the state of Chihuahua.</p>

<p>In Mexico!!! We would never see him again. Typical of his kind, commit crimes in the US and skate back across the border to never be punished!</p>

		<p>I believe this was a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Inspector and not a Border Patrol agent.  Inspectors work the land and airports, while the Border Patrol works between the land ports.</p>
<p>Customs Inspectors have had this problem for years.  In fact CBP&rsquo;s own website on their internal net, used to post something called Hall of Shame.  Here they identified those Officers who were convicted of crimes like the one referenced in this story. There were plenty to report, but most were barely mentioned in the news if at all.  Border Patrol agents rarely made the list. </p>
<p>The reasons for these criminal tendencies are many, including downright rock dumb leadership among most senior officers. The biggest pool is centered within the &#8220;brain trust&#8221; that operates out to the Reagan building in DC.   </p>
<p>The new recruit from day one sees examples of incompetence, corruption, poor integrity, and laziness, so he quickly adapts to the new culture. If he does&rsquo;t, some excuse will be made up to get rid of him. </p>
<p>Since Customs is politically corrected, those in charge care far more about acceptable &#8220;cultural&#8221; mix among the recruits than they do quality.  To gain this correct mix, they lower the entrance requirements and water down training demands so that not too many in the favorite group fail.    </p>
<p>US Customs for years has been a quasi criminal gang, they just covered their tracks very well and threw a sacrificial lamb out to prosecute from time to time.  To move up one must be able to look the other way, kiss appropriate body parts of senior members, be a sexual pervert and homosexual.</p>
<p>For a long time it was thought, with some evidence, that recruit training at the major Custom&rsquo;s training base was run by  a homosexual ring.  To move up&hellip;..you can guess the qualifications.    </p>

		<p>Anonymous 2,</p>
<p>Michael Medved is of the view that more illegals come via ship and plane than on foot over the border. He will always challenge with a curt, &#8220;What is your source?&#8221;.</p>
<p>In that vein, what is your source?</p>

		<p>The Mexican birth certificate instantly put Cordero into the &#8220;flight risk&#8221; category; thus the no-bond hold.  When I was in trouble with the feds 10 years ago, my Australian permanent resident visa had me in the same situation.</p>

		<p>On my recent family trip to Tombstone I was shocked to see that all U.S. border agents there looked Mexican.</p>

		<p>Another corrupted Border Patrol agent who just also happens to be mexican. Can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m all that surprised. This is a natural occurrence when you hire from a culture where corruption and breaking the law is common place. It&rsquo;s as if we have the fox guarding the hen house! No telling how many anchor babies we have guarding that border who still have significant ties to the very country they&rsquo;re supposed to be defending us against.</p>
<p>This is what happens when an agency that&rsquo;s supposed to be defending us becomes politically corrected&hellip;.<br>

		<p>Walt, again I tell you the source.  CBP&rsquo;s own admissions, their website. Simply do a quick web search as well. Get one of your buds in Customs to look for you on his internal site. You will find that what I said about Customs criminality is accurate.  The agency should be abolished and replaced by unarmed private clerks. </p>
<p>Illegals do not come by plane.  They are legal when they enter. They may have lied to get entrance authority but at the very least they have what seems to be proper documentation. Problem is legal entrants overstay and remain in country on tourist visa etc. Nobody goes in search of them.  ICE is suppose to do this, but what a joke. </p>
<p>Since Customs inspectors are so poorly trained and supervised they likely will not be able in many cases to identify false documents of passengers entering the airport anyway.  </p>
<p>There was a well know test given to Customs inspectors at one the crossings into Texas from Mexico where the GAO cadre used false and real docs to enter the US.  None of the inspectors caught the false docs.  The same cadre showed the same docs to a number of barkeeps in Las Vegas, all bartenders identified the false documents from the real. </p>
<p>Turns out that Customs recruit training on false docs had been reduced from about three days,  which included extensive labs, to a few hours of lecture.    </p>
<p>More illegals by ship? Come on.  Common sense rules this out.  If Medved said this, what was his source?  What is your source that he said this?  In what article did he say it? </p>
<p>Some illegals do hide in containers but they are found dead in most cases.  I&rsquo;m aware of only one regularly scheduled ocean passenger service and that was (or is) the QEII from South Hampton to NY six months of the year.  </p>
<p>On cruise ships, all passengers are counted on and off and they must carry immigration documents.   </p>
<p>Medved is an excellent debater but sometimes he says things so quickly and with so much authority that on the surface it is believable.  </p>
<p>Once he said on one of his programs about ten years ago that white people in the US should not worry about Mexicans flooding in, because Mexicans are white people too.  Believe that if you wish.   </p>
