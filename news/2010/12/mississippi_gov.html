			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christopher Weber, Politics Daily, December 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gov. Haley Barbour took heat Monday for comments that appeared to minimize the racial tensions of the civil rights movement and praise segregationist organizations in 1960s Mississippi. </p>
<p>Barbour, whose name has been mentioned as a possible Republican candidate for president in two years, was interviewed for a lengthy profile in the the Weekly Standard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just don&rsquo;t remember it as being that bad,&#8221; Barbour said of race relations during the early 1960s in his hometown of Yazoo City, Miss. </p>
<p>The two-term governor credited the relatively peaceful integration of schools in Yazoo City to Citizens Councils, all-white segregationist groups that formed in Mississippi in the mid-1950s. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You heard of the Citizens Councils? Up north they think it was like the KKK. Where I come from it was an organization of town leaders,&#8221; Barbour told the magazine. &#8220;In Yazoo City they passed a resolution that said anybody who started a chapter of the Klan would get their ass run out of town. If you had a job, you&rsquo;d lose it. If you had a store, they&rsquo;d see nobody shopped there. We didn&rsquo;t have a problem with the Klan in Yazoo City.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The governor said during King&rsquo;s speech, &#8220;We were sort of out there on the periphery. We just sat on our cars, watching the girls, talking, doing what boys do. We paid more attention to the girls than to King.&#8221;</p>
<p>The remarks garnered criticism from liberal bloggers, the NAACP and Democratic officials.</p>

		<p>I wish guys like Barbour would just shut up about race. Either that or have the courage to defend your views when they are challenged. Whites just look so pathetic and weak when they grovel over racial remarks that are 100% true yet considered &#8220;offensive.&#8221;</p>

		<p>He is guilty of speaking while White.</p>
<p>Hinton Rowan Helper was White and spoke when Whites were free from the tyrannization of the Diversity Curse.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you get the feeling that speaking out on any racial issue without blaming Whitey for everything puts you in jeapordy of losing your job and career and White friends?</p>
<p>We are not free, it will get worse, and there&rsquo;s no reason to expect anything better than slavery.  Your job is to make yourself and your family as strong and independent as possible.  Contribute nothing to instituitions that embrace Diversity.  Everything you give will be taken by the Diversities, and once removed from White Privilege, your donations will forever make the Diversity stronger and hasten the day of our demise.  </p>
<p>GIVE NOTHING EXCEPT CONTEMPT!</p>

		<p>I remember reading about a similar view stated by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.  He said something like he had never, ever been threatened, either vocally or physically, by any white person during his entire life in the South.</p>
<p>Blacks and liberal whites practically hanged for that one.<br>

		<p>I think Barbour&rsquo;s reading of that particular element of history is a little bit inaccurate.  It&rsquo;s not that the CCA (Citizens Councils of America, the proper name of the organization   &mdash;   Not &#8220;White Citizens Councils,&#8221; as ignorant journalists use) wanted school deseg, and it&rsquo;s not that they were hostile to the K-group for leftist reasons.  It&rsquo;s that they wanted to clear out the embarrassing elements of the right wing and keep some semblance of racial peace, in order for the Feds not to have any pretext to swoop in and ram desegregation in their faces.  In other words, wipe the honey off your face before the bear comes around. </p>
<p>Now, the Feds would eventually get that pretext, thanks to FBI &#8220;informants&#8221; running around in K uniforms burning black churches and the like.</p>
<p>I read that article, and several other versions.  What surprises me is that they don&rsquo;t drag the modern day Council of Conservative Citizens into it, because the CofCC succeeded and supplanted the CCA in an organizational sense.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good candidate to me!  But I doubt anyone perceived as &#8220;racist&#8221; could win a national election.</p>

		<p>I read the whole interview - not really hostile to Barbour, other than saying he was a Washington lobbyist that secured huge Fed contracts.</p>
<p>The short comment about his small Mississippi town not being so bad and the local business group the Citizens Council worked to integrate the public schools in a peaceful way, with no K violence, that&rsquo;s hardly controversial to anyone here or anyone who would ever consider voting for a White person from the South.</p>
<p>So the mainstream media, and lamestream Neo Conservative media is jumping all over Barbour saying he is defending the evil RACIST pre civil rights South and wants to bring back segregation, slavery etc. This shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise to anyone who reads American Renaissance Magazine.</p>
<p>The main issue here is to see how Barbour handles it, does he back down, apologize, pander - and it looks like he is doing just that. Our side needs to become as powerful as the anti White MSM. We must demand that leaders who present themselves as our leaders not pander, not back down, not run and cry in terror just because some vicious liars in the MSM shout &#8220;You&rsquo;re RACIST&#8221;.</p>
<p>Does this Barbour guy have any courage, is he another coward? If so, he should go back to being an insider Washington lobbyist - he can&rsquo;t speak for us.</p>
