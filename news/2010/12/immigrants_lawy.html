<h1><a href="https://www.wtop.com/?sid=2193093&amp;nid=104">Immigrants&rsquo; Lawyers Using Culture As Crime Defense</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Samantha Henry, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), December 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The case highlighted a legal strategy that experts say immigrants&rsquo; defense lawyers are using increasingly in the U.S.: the argument that a defendant&rsquo;s actions reflect his cultural upbringing, rather than criminal intent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bryant [Susan Bryant, a law professor at the City University of New York] said demand for cross-cultural training among legal professionals has steadily increased over the past decade.</p>
<p>Bukie Adetula represented the Togolese immigrant, Akouavi Kpade Afolabi, who was convicted of human trafficking and visa fraud charges at her 2009 federal trial in Newark. Prosecutors alleged Afolabi brought at least 20 girls between the ages of 10 and 19 from West African nations on fraudulent visas to New Jersey, effectively enslaving them and forcing them to work in African hair braiding salons for no pay.</p>
<p>Adetula argued that what prosecutors called clear-cut signs of modern slavery were considered protective measures in African culture: restricting telephone access, holding the girls&rsquo; passports, and forbidding them from going out of the house unaccompanied.</p>
<p>&#8220;America is supposed to be a country made up of so many different cultures, so, yes, make the laws, and enforce the laws,&#8221; Adetula said. &#8220;Do not make different sets of laws for different people, but look to the interpretations of acts, before you say: &#8216;Oh, it&rsquo;s an offensive act, it&rsquo;s against the law, it amounts to human slavery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adetula, a Nigerian native who has been practicing law in New Jersey for more than two decades, is one of many lawyers  &mdash;  often immigrants themselves  &mdash;  who bridge the divide between their clients&rsquo; cultural or religious backgrounds and the American legal system.</p>
<p>Raymond Wong, a lawyer in New York City&rsquo;s Chinatown neighborhood who has a large Asian immigrant client base, said his challenge is often twofold: explaining a client&rsquo;s cultural customs to Americans, while persuading foreign-born clients who prefer resolving disputes through negotiation to use the U.S. court system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Defense attorney Tony Serra gained national prominence for his use of cultural defenses in two separate California cases in the 1990s where American Indians were accused of fatally shooting law enforcement officers. Serra&rsquo;s cultural defense tactics included using expert witnesses on American Indian culture to argue the alleged perpetrators were victims of longstanding anti-Indian racial prejudice, historical tragedies, and a deeply rooted fear of authorities. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lawyers like Adetula emphasize that factoring in someone&rsquo;s cultural upbringing can help juries and judges determine the degree of an offense or the severity of punishment; they say it is not meant to excuse criminal acts.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are aspects of American culture that may not be acceptable in other parts of the world also, and we hear stories of Americans hiking in other countries and they get arrested, or taking pictures at places where it&rsquo;s offensive in other countries, and getting arrested,&#8221; Adetula said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not a one-sided thing.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The lawyers are correct - there is no such thing as a universal culture.</p>
<p>National borders, not laws, are more effective at containing unique national customs and cultures of distinct peoples, defining the limitations of their habitation and influence.</p>
<p>Drawing their conclusions out fully, the lawyers would have to concede that indiscriminate immigration policies are inherently flawed, and the remedy is to forbid the practice.</p>

		<p>My own picture taking story in a foreign country took place in Argentina, Thank God. I had my camera out for a furtive shot near a military base when the guard came running over. I explained to him thru sign language that I WAS NOT photgraphing the base. Only the cool sign on the barb wire fence  that showed a tourist getting shot photographing the base. If it had been Malaysia instead of B.A. it would have cost more than a Pepsi and a smile to not become a Locked Up Abroad episode&hellip;</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re trying to scam the court. Holding someone&rsquo;s passport, limiting outside communication and guarding them while outside is not &#8220;protecting&#8221; them, it&rsquo;s holding them hostage no matter where you are from. The defense lawyers are banking on the likelihood of most people not having much knowledge of what the cultures of Africa are like and so could be misled and sold some nonsense, getting their clients off the hook.</p>

<p>As I said in another post:</p>
<p>Nobody decent sends their brat 9,000 miles across The Big Water without preconditional expectations of CV, references and _some kind of scheduled contact plan_ as a verification of safety and good grades and general happiness.</p>
<p>The exception being someone looking to sell that brat&rsquo;s feeding and care into someone else&rsquo; hands, at a profit.  Never expecting to see them again.</p>
<p>Such a vile act would certainly never happen more than once without it becoming common knowledge that X personality was a human trafficker.</p>
<p>But then again, if we admitted that Blacks and Arabs had been doing this to _other blacks_ for 700 years before whites got started for 3 centuries more, the entire facade of racial reparations and guilt tripping as a means to entitlement for the protected stupid classes, would come crashing to a halt.</p>
<p>And of course, since this &#8216;crime culture&rsquo; is safely ensconced and untouchable back in Togo, the lawyers can equally make bald faced lies about their client&rsquo;s stated vs. actual motives and nobody can send a subpoena to gut the defendant&rsquo;s lies on the stand.</p>

<p>Yes, it is a one-sided thing because those American hikers are only visiting those other countries.  By doing so, they support the tourist industry in those countries.  When they&rsquo;re done hiking and taking photos, they go home.  </p>
<p>In contrast, the Africans who come here typically have no intention of returning to Africa.  They want to get as far away from their trashy countries as they can and they want to stay away as long as they can.  When they arrive at our shores, it is their responsibility to shed their old ways and become Americans.  If they wish to adhere to the old ways, let them go back to Africa.  So, any time such a defense is used, whatever sentence they receive should be followed by deportation.</p>

		<p>As a court interpreter, I saw this &#8220;cultural-jurisprudential&#8221; (How do you say &#8220;Sharia Law&#8221; in Mexican Spanish?) trend developing many years ago. One case about five years ago comes to mind. </p>
<p>The case in question involved the statutory rape of a 13 year old southern Mexico Indian girl by a 24 year old male of the same ethnic description. The LARGE extended families of both parties were well acquainted and numerically well represented during court proceedings (so much for trembling in the shadows). By the time this plea bargain played out in front of a &#8220;Special Circuit Superior Court Judge&#8221; in NC (absolute age of consent in NC is 16) the Amerindian girl was fourteen and ripe with child. </p>
<p>In the interim between original complaint/arrest (seven months) and the plea, the extended families had made their peace and had asked the court to make the criminal charges &#8220;go away&#8221;. </p>
<p>The DA acquiesced and the &#8220;special&#8221; Superior Court Judge just grimaced and asked: &#8220;How much younger counselors?&#8221; before custom crafting (ie legislating from the bench) his bizarre judgement which was:</p>
<p>1-One year&rsquo;s probation with a special condition that the defendant marry (pursuant to special court permission and parental consent) his swollen minor princess.</p>
<p>2- That he provide for child support of his child and not violate any NC or Federal laws.</p>

		<p> I was wondering when this sort of event would take place. If &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; is to be the law of the land; then logic demands that everything that every culture does must be tolerated. </p>
<p> The consequences of this attitude will be that American laws will become almost unenforceable; except for &#8220;real&#8221; Americans and all the other cultures will be allowed to practice their own customs and laws of their culture.</p>
<p> Anarchy will prevail, if no one is in charge; then everyone is in charge. </p>

		<p>Once again I agree with sbuffalonative, though I would term it more &#8220;crime as cultural&#8221;.<br>
If these peoples from the third world want to actually claim that crime is their culture, then we should obviously NOT let anybody from those &#8220;cultures&#8221; in our country.<br>
If their &#8220;culture&#8221; is criminal under our laws, then they should not come here, and we should not let them.  Period.  As for the specific case here, the argument is no defense from guilt or conviction according to OUR laws.  They broke OUR laws while in OUR country.  Convict and deport.  Expel all others from that same &#8220;culture&#8221;.  And slam the door shut.  For good.  Besides, if they didn&rsquo;t know or believe what they were doing was criminal in nature, why do they go to such great lengths to HIDE their activity?</p>

		<p>In some African countries, rape is not even a crime. If this lawyer&rsquo;s stratagem is allowed to succeed, every African rapist in this country will have a &#8220;cultural defense.&#8221; In fact the victims will be guilty of &#8220;intolerance&#8221; for merely objecting to being raped, and attempting to prosecute African rapists will be a &#8220;hate crime.&#8221;</p>

		<p>*I* was taught that ignorance of that law is no excuse.</p>
<p>If I go back far enough into my own cultural history, I can find cultural teachings which would allow, promote, or even demand:</p>
<p>what most Western cultures would define as rape<br>
infanticide<br>
incest<br>
human sacrifice/killings most societies currently label as murder<br>
polygamy<br>
prostitution</p>
<p>to name just a few. I would like to say that I had to go really far back to find such things, but I&rsquo;m only 3rd generation American by birth. Some cultures are just freaking creepy about what&rsquo;s &#8220;OK&#8221; - which is part of why my family came here in the first place.</p>
<p>To one degree or another, all of these things are forbidden by current Federal and/or State Law in the US. Therefore, my responsibility as a part of choosing to continue being a citizen here is to know where my cultural beliefs and the law conflict&hellip;AND DEFER TO THE LATTER.</p>
<p>How is this not obvious on its face? What reasonable &#8220;defense&#8221; is &#8220;My people don&rsquo;t think this is wrong&#8221; ?!?<br>
