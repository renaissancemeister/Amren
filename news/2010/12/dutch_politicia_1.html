<h1><a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3995574,00.html">Dutch Politician Urges Jews to &#8216;Emigrate to US or Israel&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Israel News, December 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Prominent Dutch politician Frits Bolkestein sparked an uproar in the Netherlands by saying practicing Jews had &#8220;no future here, and should emigrate to the US or Israel,&#8221; French newspaper Le Monde reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the recently released book &#8220;The Decay; Jews in a Rudderless Netherlands&#8221; by Manfred Gerstenfeld, chairman of the Board of Fellows at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, the former European Commissioner and ex-leader of Holland&rsquo;s ruling rightist VVD party is quoted as saying there is no future for Orthodox Jews in Holland because of &#8220;the anti-Semitism among Dutchmen of Moroccan descent, whose numbers keep growing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that the increase in anti-Semitic incidents in the Netherlands over the past decade had led him to have limited confidence in the government&rsquo;s ability to fight anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>Bolkestein also said he was &#8220;pessimistic regarding the never-ending Israeli-Palestinian conflict that feeds anti-Semitism.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Dutch parliament is expected to hold a special session to discuss Bolkestein&rsquo;s remarks.</p>
<p>Geert Wilders, the leader of the anti-Islam Party for Freedom, reacted by saying that &#8220;not Jews should emigrate, but anti-Semitic Moroccans.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>And some Americans still think Jews are the problem &#8220;because they run the media and banks&#8221;.</p>
<p>The truth is, here in Europe there are nearly no Jews at all and if there are some, they hide themselves because of Muslims. In fact the few Jews are the conservatives who want less immigration or deport criminals back like Sharkozy but lefties -mostly none-Jews and born around 1969- call this people racists and want more immigration.</p>
<p>Not the Jews are the problem. The problem are lefties coming from a time in which all threads were made by whites (nuclear bombs in Russia and America, Hitler had destroyed whole Europe&hellip;) and none-white people were far away and had small populations.</p>

		<p>Would this be a problem if the population was 100% ethnic Dutch?  No!  This is why Diversity is so toxic   &mdash;   it almost always leads to conflict.</p>
<p>How do you destroy the unity and community spirit of a nation? How do you weaken a nation?  It is easy: simply make it multicultural.  </p>

Its funny, isn&rsquo;t it, that the mainstream politician told Jews that, essentially, he&rsquo;d rather they leave than the Moslem invaders, whereas the &#8220;far-right: politician Geert Wilders, accused of anti-semitism on many occasions I&rsquo;m sure, takes a stand against Moslems in defense of Holland&rsquo;s Jews.</p>

		<p>As always, I have to agree with Geert Wilders, one of a few politicians I admire and respect. Unfortunately, I doubt, they <br/>
will ever deport any moslems for anti-Semitism&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Bolkestein in correct in that the inundation of Western European (and other Western)countries with Muslims leads to vastly increased attacks (including physical) on identifiable Jews. However, Wilders&rsquo; conclusion is more useful. It is Europe&rsquo;s indigenous White Christian peoples, and their race and civilization, that are under attack in their homelands (as well as within the societies they have created elsewhere: in the case of states founded by the Anglo-Saxons and celts, in Australia/NZ and North America). Attacks by Muslim invaders against Jews is merely a corollary of Islam&rsquo;s war against Israel, the Jewish ethno-state in the Middle East; which in turn is merely an instance of the &#8216;bloody borders of Islam&rsquo; worldwide (cf. the strife between Muslims and: Han Chinese, Hindusim, Buddhism, Russians). </p>
<p> So the VVD ex-leader&rsquo;s remarks are true as far as they go; and furthermore the Jews living in Holland, France, and anywhere else in Europe might indeed want to consider relocating. But Geert Wilders&rsquo; take is more relevant to the interests of the actual Dutch nation(and the other nations of Europe). As I have written in another post, the future of Western countries will be very bleak unless and until the third-world reverse colonization wave is stopped AND reversed.</p>

		<p>Even better yet, how about the Dutch simply barring &#8216;anti-semitic Moroccans&rsquo; from entering the country. That would seem to be the most logical solution to the problem. But then again, what do the liberal politicians in power over there know about logic? </p>

		<p>Wait a minute, isn&rsquo;t this tolerance and diversity in action?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this what Jews push on everyone else?</p>
<p>Could it be that the Jews might soon start becoming a little more conservative?</p>
<p>Bolkestein is correct.</p>

		<p>Comment #9: Jews and Arabs do share genetic history. It&rsquo;s not just a Bible story of Ishmael and Issac. But, the two cultures have always been seperate, although the numerous Jews in MidEast nations and in spain shared some cultural similarities,and at times some alliances.  Also extensive conflict, with the Arabs on top all of the time till the 20th century. </p>
<p>As for the european jews, on the whole they do share those semitic genes too, but culturally have nothing in common with Arabs or Turks, and they have been far more similar to Christians in Europe since the fall of the Roman Empire, if not before.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s mentioned that many of the Dutch Jews arrived in Holland at the invitation of the Dutch after the Dutch tossed out the Spanish king whose predecessors in turn threw the Jews out of Spain (and Portugal) in 1492.  The majority of Dutch Jews come from the sephardic &#8220;mideast&#8221; wing of Jewry from an ethnic origin(and thus ironically may share heriditary traits with Moroccans where Jews lived). But the Jews in Holland have been Dutch and have been fairly assimilated there since at least the 17th century.</p>
<p>The Arabs are generally historical ignoramuses. Those who aren&rsquo;t deliberately distort history. They did that to the vast detriment of the Palestinians by failure to recognize the genuine passion Jews had for Palestine as a homeland.  They repeat their mistake by taking on the small but smart and tough Dutch Jewish community.</p>
<p>Jews have proved throughout history that numbers may mean you lose some battles at great cost in lives and treasure. But, in the long-run, financial smarts, ethnic pride and historical perspective (which, IMO, the Jews and Chinese, traditionally and today, have far more of than anyone else) win epochal and transformational wars. </p>
<p>In the end, Hitler was a pathetic failure in death, as he was in his fairly sad and unsuccessful life.  To think that these illiterate morons will succeed where Hitler strategically failed, is ludicrous. </p>
<p>The &#8220;Dutch&#8221; Moroccans, Indonesian Muslim &#8220;Dutch&#8221;, and other troublemakers for the Jews, should be worried.  Very worried.</p>

		<p>  Yes, those Jews who have supported open borders and Third World Immigration have made a huge mistake. Large immigrant Muslim communities will serve as centers of European anti-Semitism. We can see this now in Sweden and Holland. I see the correlation between rising Muslim populations and anti-Semitism, but some Jewish organizations live in the past and are against any manifestation of European nationalism or white ethnic pride. This is foolish, very foolish on their part. </p>

		<p>   A comment for poster #5: Wilders has never been accused of antisemitism and is, in fact, a strong supporter of Israel. He spent time on a kibbutz as a teenager and has been in love with the country ever since. Since becoming a member of the Dutch parliament, he has visited &#8220;the promised land&#8221; on numerous occasions and strongly defended it as one of the bastions of Western values. The following link will provide an illumination of Wilder&rsquo;s warm feelings for Israel: <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/141007" rel="nofollow">http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/141007</a></p>
<p>  For poster #6: Bolkenstein&rsquo;s comments were specifically addressing the orthodox segment of the Jewish population, a group that has never been liberal and has never advocated pushing &#8220;tolerance and diversity&#8221; on anyone. </p>
<p><br/>
  For poster #9: Antisemitism, in its classical historical sense, has always been directed at Jews and not at Arabs. Wilhelm Marr, who coined the term, and all subsequent users of same, never used it with reference to any other group but Jews. Muslims are not an ethnic group, unlike Jews, which is another difference; the largest Muslim land is Oriental Indonesia, not &#8220;Semitic&#8221; Saudi Arabia, for example.    </p>

		<p>Now let me make sure I have this right.<br/>
A Muslinm says The Jew is trash and they ask the Jew to leave.<br/>
A White Person says anything about anybody who isn&rsquo;t also White he is a RACIST, without regard to the truth of his statement.<br/>

		<p>We&rsquo;re seeing the failure of the liberal, multicultist ideology in action all throughout Europe.  One wonders if the Europeans will wake up in time?  Alas, I know too many Euro-liberals who will, in typical ideologue fashion, rationalize away outrages such as this, blaming it all on lack of education and on &#8220;racism.&#8221;  I wonder at what point liberals will realize that their ideology is a delusion which is dooming the West?  When we have seen Europe finally overrun and Christians, Jews, etc., driven off the continent?  </p>

How naive some of these posters are!   &#8220;German&#8221; seems to suppose that you have to be present in large numbers in order to exert influence or control.  Did the Afrikaners rule S. Africa by means of their greater numbers?  Do the whites in Mexico and Brazil control those countries by virtue of their superior numbers?   Do the Tri-lateral Commission  and such groups control international trade and politics through their overwhelming numbers?  <br/>
 <br/>
It is often more convenient to live elsewhere, lie low, and use a large, powerful country as a surrogate to impose one&rsquo;s will on others.  If you control the large fish, the small fish will obey.  If you control the lead ram, the lambs will follow.<br/>
 <br/>
When it was decided (in and by Washington) to go to war with Saddam and bomb Iraq into oblivion for having all those dangerous WMD&rsquo;s and being a threat to civilization,  we saw all the satellites meekly get in line, with hardly a murmur.  Well, most of them   &mdash;   Tony Blair, recognizing his master&rsquo;s voice, fell immediately into line. But France (as usual) did balk.   But that  difficult French president  (who imagined he was independent!) was replaced at the very next election (and then put on trial on corruption charges).  Now France has a president who is much more amenable to  Washington&rsquo;s wishes. We see the same obedient  line-up happening today with Iran.<br/>
 <br/>
Did General Clark and Madeline Albright have to live inside Serbia in order to impose their mandate that &hellip;<i>&#8220;There is no place in modern Europe for pure ethnic states&#8221;</i>?   Or did they use the US Air Force  (and NATO) as their instruments to enforce their imperious will and impose multiculturalism on the recalcitrant Serbs?  Germany itself is at present little more than a satellite state, frankly, although it is allowed the face-saving grace to think it is independent, which it is to only a degree.  But it still has US military bases and personnel, and no peace treaty has ever been signed.  In other words, it is still an occupied country.  In major matters on which there is no debate or negotiation, Germany, like all others in the Western System,  must do as it&rsquo;s told.  Ultimately, it will do as the US Congress tells it.  And who is telling the US Congress?  As we can see from our catastrophic immigration impasse, it is certainly NOT the American people!<br/>
