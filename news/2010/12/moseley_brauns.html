<h1>Moseley Braun&rsquo;s Financial Angel</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Jackson, Sun-Times (Chicago), December 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Carol Moseley Braun needed money for her new business, the onetime U.S. senator and ambassador  &mdash;  now one of the big names in the race for Chicago mayor  &mdash;  turned to a former campaign contributor for help.</p>
<p>Joseph Stroud, a millionaire TV station owner from Oak Brook, came through in August 2006 with a $250,000 loan for her company, Ambassador Organics, a line of coffees, teas and spices.</p>
<p>That was about nine months after Stroud  &mdash;  the owner of WJYS-Channel 62, a station that fills its airtime with paid religious programming, health shows and infomercials  &mdash;  was found liable of harassing a former employee in a racially charged court case that the U.S. Supreme Court upheld last month.</p>
<p>As the race to succeed Mayor Daley heats up, Braun now seems eager to distance herself from her benefactor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The case stemmed from Stroud&rsquo;s firing of a woman named Jerri Blount in October 2000. Blount  &mdash;  who, like Stroud, is black  &mdash;  had taken the side of a white woman, fired by Stroud&rsquo;s company, who then filed a federal discrimination lawsuit.</p>
<p>After being fired herself, Blount sued Stroud. She testified that he got mad at her for backing her co-worker, called her an &#8220;ignorant n  &mdash;    &mdash;  &#8221; and told her she shouldn&rsquo;t &#8220;side with&#8221; the other woman because &#8220;white people&#8221; have &#8220;done nothing for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blount also testified that, another time, Stroud &#8220;started screaming at her and told her that she needed to know who she was &#8216;up against,&rsquo; asserting that he was &#8216;one of the richest n  &mdash;    &mdash;  s in the world,&#8221; and that she did not know who she was &#8216;f  &mdash;  ing with,&#8221;&#8221; {snip}.</p>
<p>On Nov. 21, 2005, a Cook County jury ruled against Stroud, finding him liable in the civil case for retaliating against Blount and ordering him to pay her nearly $3.1 million. With the Supreme Court&rsquo;s Nov. 1 refusal to hear Stroud&rsquo;s final appeal, the amount he owes has now swelled to more than $6 million, including interest and other costs, records show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite Braun&rsquo;s statement distancing herself from Stroud, she&rsquo;s still on the hook to him for the $250,000 loan, which is secured through one of four mortgages on her five-bedroom, 4.5-bath house in Hyde Park near the University of Chicago. She appears to have fallen behind the original repayment schedule on that and another loan, the second from First Midwest Bank for $97,025, records on file at the Cook County Recorder of Deeds office show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Braun says the terms of both loans have been renegotiated and that she is current with her payments under the new terms, though she declined to provide details. She also says she&rsquo;s up to date on her two other mortgages, which total $1.53 million.</p>
<p>In March, she put her house up for sale, later explaining she didn&rsquo;t need such a big home after her grown son had decided not to go ahead with plans to move in with her. Asking price: $1.9 million  &mdash;  $200,000 more than she bought it for in December 2006.</p>
<p>Now, Braun acknowledges that the recession has hurt her company, which she launched in 2005. {snip}</p>

		<p> Note how Mostly Brown   &mdash;   er, Moseley Braun   &mdash;   tries to hitch a ride on the coattails of the conservative wave of November by describing herself as a &#8220;small business owner.&#8221; Perhaps it was because she was devoting so much time to &#8220;saving&#8221; her business that she managed to blunder into such an embarrasing situation as she now faces.</p>
<p> With four mortgages (ask any banker and he&rsquo;ll tell you the last three don&rsquo;t count) on her home, including money owed to a black millionaire being sued by another black for &#8220;discrimination,&#8221; Moseley Braun appears bent on proving that she only gained her Senate seat by a fluke, and lost it because she wasn&rsquo;t qualified for it in the first place.</p>

<p>Oak Brook is one eof the MOST wealthiest communities in the U.S. Almost exclusively inhabited by the VERY rich. NOT only wealthy but almost totally WHITEY!!</p>
<p>Butler, the original developer of Oak Brook, was an ardent &#8220;let-the-races-not-mix&#8221; advocate. </p>

		<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, all of the major credible candidates for Chicago Mayor are so crooked that they&rsquo;re going to have to screw them into the ground when their souls have gone to the Great Beyond.  Therefore, I consider any &#8220;hit pieces&#8221; against one in the Chicago media to be aid and comfort to one of the other candidates, in the Sun-Times&rsquo;s case, Rahm.</p>

		<p>Does anyone want to wager that Mr. Stroud was one of the lucky ones who hit the jackpot when the government doled out a handful of broadcasting licenses to minority owners in the name of diversity? So much for whites not helping others. </p>
<p>As for Carol &#8220;Mostly Fraud,&#8221; she managed to win the US Senate nomination by a plurality when two other candidates split the vote. In a state dominated by Democratic voters, she managed to lose to a Republican outsider during her re-election bid. The only issue that this opponent had working in his favor is that Illinois voters disliked Carol Moseley Braun&rsquo;s arrogant diva routine. </p>
<p>Braun lived a charmed life on account of affirmative action. When she was employed in the US Attorney&rsquo;s office, I doubt that she ever handled a file. When she was caught up in financial irregularities relating to a family member&rsquo;s estate, she was never prosecuted.  </p>
