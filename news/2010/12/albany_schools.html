			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jill Tucker, San Francisco Chronicle, November 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The city of Albany is up in arms over new district-imposed controls on PTA cash at each of the city&rsquo;s three elementary schools, with the school board dictating what parents can  &mdash;  or more specifically can&rsquo;t  &mdash;  buy for their kids to supplement their public education.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Albany district officials decided it wasn&rsquo;t fair for two of the schools, Marin and Cornell, to have parent-funded academic extras like chess, art and music class while Ocean View, their less affluent sister school, went without. So the district suspended those extra classes.<br>

		<p>Parents in zip code A donate some of their disposable income to the PTA so their children can have extra classes.  Parents in zip code B use most of their disposable income to roll doobies.  I&rsquo;m wondering in what kind of crazy clusterfreak world should students in zip code A not get the extra enrichment because parents in zip code B would rather roll doobies than enrich their children.  Then it dawned on me:  It&rsquo;s this world, one pathologically obsessed with racial equality.</p>
<p>From the original:</p>
<p><i>Jack O&rsquo;Connell, the state schools superintendent, has spent the past eight years visiting hundreds of schools across the state and has seen the disparities firsthand.</i></p>
<p>You may not think it judging from who won California statewide elections last month, but California really dodged a fast bullet when O&rsquo;Connell decided not to run for Governor   &mdash;   He was thinking of doing just that.  (He didn&rsquo;t try for another term as State School Superintendent, either.)  O&rsquo;Connell explicitly blames black and Hispanic stupidity on white teachers.  Last I looked, he is white, and a &#8220;teacher&#8221; of sorts, so I guess he was blaming himself.</p>

<p>Libertarian economist Murray Rothbard has pertinent comments on the role of race in a free society:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If and when we as populists and libertarians abolish the welfare state in all of its aspects, and property rights and the free market shall be triumphant once more, many individuals and groups will predictably not like the end result. In that case, those ethnic and other groups who might be concentrated in lower-income or less prestigious occupations, guided by their socialistic mentors, will predictably raise the cry that free-market capitalism is evil and &lsquo;discriminatory&rsquo; and that therefore collectivism is needed to redress the balance. In that case, the intelligence argument will become useful to defend the market economy and the free society from ignorant or self-serving attacks. In short; racialist science is properly not an act of aggression or a cover for oppression of one group over another, but, on the contrary, an operation in defense of private property against assaults by aggressors.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>When I was growing up on the south side of Chicago and attending a racially mixed school, I remember that the black kids thought many of the white kids were spoiled because we took music lessons, dance lessons, etc. I remember thinking the black kids were spoiled because they typically wore expensive designer clothing. </p>

		<p><i>with the school board what parents can &mdash; or more specifically can&rsquo;t &mdash; buy for their kids to supplement their public education.</i></p>
<p>So, the little authoritarians get to <b>dictate</b> to &#8220;rich&#8221; parents what they can/can&rsquo;t do with their own money. As this is San Francisco, the school board must be in Soviet Heaven.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like those &#8220;rich&#8221; parents are funding the educational system in California, an educational system that is mostly poor and non-Whites.</p>
<p>What the media and school board won&rsquo;t tell you is that &#8216;poor&rsquo; schools are showered with Title I monies, to the tune of $12.7 billion per year, monies that are supposed to be used to &#8216;close the achievement gap&rsquo; by providing low, at-risk or poorly performing students with supplemental material to &#8220;improve curriculum, instructional activities, counseling, parental involvement, increased staff and program improvement.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/dbjlty</p>
<p>Monies that are not showered on your White/Asian children to supplement or improve their educations.</p>
<p>For an entire school to qualify for Title 1 funds, at least 40% of students must be enrolled in the free and reduced lunch program.  One of my colleagues at a non-Title 1 schools tells me that at her school, students were heavily pressured to apply for the government-slop that passes for food, even going so far as to run a school-wide contest, the winner the classroom that signed up the most students for the free-lunch, breakfast (and soon) dinner program (don&rsquo;t know what the prize was).  The applications were turned in, I don&rsquo;t think anyone bothered to verify a thing because all of them were accepted.   This year, for the first time, this particular school received the coveted Title 1 monies.</p>
<p>Charles Murray reports in <i>Real Education</i></p>
<p><i>Despite being conducted by people who wished the program well, no evaluation of Title 1 from the 1970s onward has found credible evidence of a significant positive impact on student achievement.</i></p>
<p>Low-income schools are showered not only with Title 1 money, but with extra counseling services, social services, parent centers, college outreach programs, volunteer do-gooder college students, free tutoring, reduced-fee or free AP/SAT tests, free Kaplan SAT prep classes ($1500/student), field trips, work-study programs and more.</p>
<p>I know because I worked in a Title 1 school for a number of years. </p>

		<p>The same group of parents who were funding the special classes should get together and fund a home school co-op where the kids can get not only basic instruction but teaching in areas where the school board has put its foot down. If they dont want to go that far they can also fund private classes outside of school hours- there are ways that kids can get a good education without having to resort to what the public school says. </p>

		<p>I find this odd that liberal elites would stand for such interference in their rigging the system of public education paid for in part with the money of riff raff without Ivy League and or graduate degrees. Mc Clain and Louden Virginia are the two most wealthy places in America. The former`s high school mascot is The Saxon and the latter`s is The Highlander. That is as white as you can get. The PTAS of both schools resemble ladies day at Chevy Chase Country club. The perks in those schools far outpace America`s most prestigious private schools. These wealthy liberals would lynch that clown before they would let him equal out the playing field they have created to foster the next generation of liberal scions. They have a sliding scale of dues that goes from 1 dollar a year to the Moon. There are a few poor folks who earn less than 100 k a year who live there and they are treated like whooping cranes and California condors. Why didn`t this clown encourage the parents in the trash school to kick in and ask the parents of the elite schools to noblese oblige it a bit and kick in a c-note a year to the trash? If he did that, he couldn`t play the class and race card next time he runs for office.<br>

		<p>As a kid in the 8th grade in a private military school with an entire school population of 250-students in the 5th to 12th grades, I was subjected to all kinds of pressures to excel. My task was to &#8220;get the job done to the best of my ability&#8221; no matter what the circumstances.  No excuses.  I had the best materials available to work with.  High discipline situation.  Nothing was &#8220;fair&#8221;, my feelings were not considered, only results were considered.</p>
<p>Of the 12 astronauts that walked on the moon, two of them came from that school (including the first man in space, Alan Shepard) What do you think the odds of that happening are?  It didn&rsquo;t happen by accident.</p>
<p><br>
I was not a natural leader, had limited natural talents in anything, and I wasn&rsquo;t very smart - if I received a &#8220;C&#8221; my entire family looked at it as victory.  However, the principles I learned at that school enabled me to become an All-American athlete, millionaire, business owner, stock market day trader,   world traveler, and I&rsquo;ve had a great life.  However, many of the top people in my classes in most part went on to achieve higher results than I because they were either smarter, worked harder, luckier, or whatever.  I did well because of the enviroment the school created, and this is the way it should be.  Had our enviroment been diluted by giving our advantages to other schools, the results would have been lessened. We must have systems that produce high achievers.  Life is not equal.</p>
<p>Point is - if you want your kids to get to the top in life, get them what they need and expect results.  If others stand in your way, crush them.  Life is not a game and it&rsquo;s certainly not &#8220;fair&#8221;, it&rsquo;s serious business.  Soon most Americans will be living in poverty, so get your kids whatever they need to excel to keep them out of the soon-to-come soup lines.  And remember that you do not advance society by taking from one group to give to another group.  Get the winners what they need to win and we all win.  Try to make everything equal and we all lose. </p>
<p>Liberalism, a mental disorder, is based on the theory that we are all equal.  Therefore, the end result of this screwed up way of thinking, if it is successful, must be that we all end up equally miserable.  It is a system that creates losers, not winners.  Fight liberalism with all you&rsquo;ve got, it is the big destroyer.  Forget equal, forget fair, think results.</p>

		<p>The parents should simply fund these activities in their own homes outside of school hours.  Note that not only would this remove all control by the district&rsquo;s Handicapper General-wannabes, but it would allow them to arbitrarily exclude disruptive troublemakers in a manner that no school is permitted.</p>
<p>City parks &amp; recreation departments also frequently make these sorts of classes available during summer vacation (at least they used to back when municipal governments weren&rsquo;t struggling to find money to pay for street repairs).  There was a lot of that sort of thing when I was growing up in Boulder.  One summer saw me getting free golf lessons every week (I&rsquo;m still a lousy golfer).</p>

The money pays for foreign language programs, drama classes and counselors, among a laundry list of extras that aren&rsquo;t available in neighboring San Mateo County school districts.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Most California Hispanic Students (70% in LA) don&rsquo;t graduate high school.  Many come to California _illiterate in their own language_.  If they don&rsquo;t want a white collar job, why do we have to pay for them to have babies instead?  That&rsquo;s right, in California upwards of _FIFTY PERCENT_ of first babies are born out of wedlock, during the teen age years.  And women have anywhere from 3.2 to 4.4 kids.  Compared to Mexico where _poverty_ keeps them t 2.4.  Still more than replacement level but at least no gobbling up social welfare while giving nothing back at all.  75% of interracial Hispanic Households, no matter who is the outsider parent, remain Hispanic Speaking through second and third generation parents.</p>
<p>They take and take and take while _conserving_ their own identity and characteristic behaviors.  In this they are to be admired.  But not encouraged.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Jack O&rsquo;Connell, the state schools superintendent, has spent the past eight years visiting hundreds of schools across the state and has seen the disparities firsthand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The inequities do cry for significant education financial reform,&#8221; he said.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Fine, close the borders and institute State Wide functional IQ tests.  For those who don&rsquo;t want to or can&rsquo;t mentally play the higher education game: immediate post-8th grade vocational training.  Let them earn the big money as construction contractors, plumbers and auto mechanics.  No, seriously, there is _good money there_ and if you start when you are 17-18 for your dad&rsquo;s company, you can make more money initially, than a college grad will in his first ten years of employment.</p>
<p>OTOH, for those who, based on their great-great grandparent&rsquo;s dreams, believe that man is NOT MADE to be a bipedal donkey, but should seek out enlightenment and a separation from the mean reality of living day to day, like an animal struggling to survive: provide the full humanities, athletics and higher level AP course placement to _cement_ those &#8216;unfair advantages&rsquo; into what they obviously are: A Genetic Leverage.</p>
<p>One which is perishable if the class and racial advantages (the phenotype and the genotype of social reality) are not _conserved_.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Liberalism, a mental disorder, is based on the theory that we are all equal. Therefore, the end result of this screwed up way of thinking, if it is successful, must be that we all end up equally miserable. It is a system that creates losers, not winners. Fight liberalism with all you&rsquo;ve got, it is the big destroyer. Forget equal, forget fair, think results.<br>

<p>Art, I know I&rsquo;d like you if I met you but I think that you put too little emphasis on the aesthetics of race.</p>
<p>On wanting what you find beautiful to be uplifted into something better than it would have been if left alone.</p>
<p>You sir, are yourself the keystone proof of this argument.  On your own, you would have been a social failure and probably dead by your late forties or early fifties.  But because someone dared to invest in sending you to an environment which saw the diamond in the coal, the sculpture in the stone, the sword in the billet steel, you were -forged- into something more.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s tail if that had happened to a black/asian/hispanic man or woman because I do not desire to share their genes with mine.  I find them ugly, alien and unapproachable.  But if these were all white schools up in NY, I would be willing to invest a little to find another Art From NC, hidden in the stones.</p>
<p>Because I know that, at some level, we are all just place markers until generational chance or God or something else finds the genetic recombination that makes our descendants as much as ourselves shine out with brilliance.</p>
<p>In this I _envy_ people like the Jews and the Parsi who deliberately keep to themselves and trade the penalties of endogroup inbreeding to achieve a more or less permanent increase in IQ.  Because IQ is the basis of it all:  Social Conformity.  Socialized Compassion.  Rational Insight.</p>
<p>Of realizing who you will or will not give kindness as uplift to.  Not as universal but rather tightly focussed Social Altruism.</p>
<p>We dare not lose the baseline population group who gives our childrens&rsquo;s childrens&rsquo; genetics the activated placemarker so that THEIR child can achieve greatness.  We dare not punish our own just to keep ourselves safe from The Other.</p>
<p>We must be allowed choice as freedom to associate, and by consequence, to exclude, from our company those whom we do not care to see improved.</p>
<p>And that is what is at risk here, whether we drink the Kool Aid of multicult diversity.  Or fight to stand apart by internal secession from all things &#8216;public funded&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Im sure that the parents could afford to fund a charter or private school since Marin co CA is one of the wealthiest counties in the entire nation. Unfortunately it is also one of the most liberal and also unfortunately for the kids the parents would feel that by giving up enrichment classes for their kids they could somehow have equality for all school kids. </p>
