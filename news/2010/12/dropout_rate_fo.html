			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jill Tucker, San Francisco Chronicle, Dec. 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than a third of California&rsquo;s African American public high school students dropped out before graduation day, a startling number and one that&rsquo;s on the rise, according to 2009 data released Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 37 percent African American dropout rate, up three percentage points from the prior year, was far above that of any other ethnic subgroup. Hispanic students had the second highest rate at 27 percent.</p>
<p>Locally, San Francisco cautiously celebrated a 9 percent overall dropout rate, a stark contrast to Oakland&rsquo;s 40 percent, numbers still under review for accuracy.</p>
<p>The statewide statistics highlight a pervasive achievement gap in test scores and graduation rates that persists despite focused efforts to boost the academic performance of black, Hispanic and low-income students, state education officials said.</p>
<p>Overall, 22 percent of state students dropped out of high school, according to the new data, up from 19 percent the year before.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[State schools Superintendent Jack] O&rsquo;Connell blamed the increase on state budget cuts, which have resulted in larger class sizes, fewer art and music classes, cuts to sports, fewer counselors and less access to career/technical courses  &mdash;  all programs that can help keep struggling or at-risk students in school.</p>
<p>In addition, drastic cuts to summer school have prevented students from catching up on credits during the break, meaning they can&rsquo;t graduate on time and too often give up.</p>

		<p>It continues to amaze me that no one can see or say the obvious.  Why is it low-income whites and Asians do not suffer these same ailments?  Why is it money will solve the problem when they haven&rsquo;t even identiified the cause of the problem?</p>
<p>I am waiting for the day when common-sense and truth make a come back. Without truth alll this reporting is nothing more than propaganda fed to the masses.</p>

		<p>I couldn`t agree more with Superintendant O` Conell, If only we spent another 2300 a year on every black student in California we would decrease the drop out rate by at least 5%.  So if we spent an additional 12,8000 per black student the rate would be zero.Their problems have nothing to do with the fact that 75% of them were born out of wed lock; or that their father and mother had a combined IQ of 160; or that even sitting in your seat and not beating up the teacher is called,&#8221; Acting White.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Where I come from, not having some art class or a spot on the sports team doesn&rsquo;t mean that you throw yourself in a garbage can by dropping out of school.  Don&rsquo;t those &#8216;expert&rsquo; educators ever take a look at gangsta rap and its messages which encourage the sorts of behavior that cause dropping out?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest.<br>
Struggling because they are not smart enough to pass.</p>
<p>At-Risk because their parents don&rsquo;t raise them right, ie: No help or support to stay in school and study (too white), drugs in the house, generation after generation of gang members.</p>

<p>Other than sports, I didn&rsquo;t take advantage of any of these in high school. We had to see a counselor once a year for about 10-15 mins to talk about future plans. I asked him for some application advice once but he couldn&rsquo;t answer my question and never got back to me (he couldn&rsquo;t even remember my name when I would see him in the hall occasionally).</p>
<p>Yet, amazingly enough, this white boy managed to graduate and never blamed his problems on other people.</p>

<p>They can&rsquo;t compete and they know it.  Besides, selling dope, robbery and pimping don&rsquo;t require any special knowledge or skills, and the pay is considerably better than that paid by <br>
any available jobs.</p>

		<p>What they don&rsquo;t tell us is the racial breakdown of San Francisco&rsquo;s &#8220;low&#8221; 9% dropout rate (which might not be that low   &mdash;   The jury is still out on that.  I think there&rsquo;s some book cooking going on.)  But if it is that low in SF, it might have something to do with San Francisco proper being too expensive for most blacks   &mdash;   I keep reading stories about blacks leaving SF because of the high cost of living.</p>
<p>I can add another theory to Jack O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s litany of bromides   &mdash;   Since the California public school system has become so predominated by Hispanics, that repels blacks, not only because most can&rsquo;t speak Spanish, but because of black-Hispanic gang feuds.</p>

		<p>In a serious high school, colorblind equilibrium black dropout rate would be something on the order of 90% (assuming a lower cutoff IQ of 100). This does not yet take into account disruption and crime. So what exactly are they complaining about?</p>

		<p>The more white society expects from blacks, the more frustrated blacks become.  New schoolhouses, state-of-the-art computers, specially tailored courses and meals, individual tutoring  &mdash;  nothing will work on people with IQ&rsquo;s simply too low to rise to the challenge.  The &#8220;talented tenth&#8221; will succeed on its own merits, and the rest will simply take the course (pun acknowleged) of least resistance.  At least this article accepts the idea that lack of vo-tech training, basket-weaving-level classes, and sports affect black participation in school.  (The reporter has probably already been accused of racism!)  But if teachers are compelled to constantly push low-IQ students and assure them they can be rocket scientists, frustration will drive them to drop out.  Black communities need to use every resource to open more black-only schools.  (When they call them Afrocentric, most whites don&rsquo;t dare object.) Smarter blacks can continue in integrated schools.</p>

		<p>We are told by advocates of school reform that we should raise standards and reduce the dropout rate. Raising standards and reducing the dropout rate is like cutting taxes and balancing the budget. It cannot be done.<br>
 <br>
When standards are raised many students discover that they lack the motivation or the intelligence to meet those standards. Therefore they drop out.  <br>
 <br>
Charles Murray has argued that most Americans get more education than they are able to benefit from. When you pour a quart of water into a cup, you waste three cups of water.  <br>
 <br>
Beyond the city limits of Lake Wobegon it is unfortunately not true that, &#8220;all the children are above average.&#8221; Half are below average. Those who find this alarming reveal an understanding of grade school arithmetic that is below average.  </p>

		<p>When money gets thrown at inner city minority schools rural majority White schools get slighted. Many rural schools are sorely lacking in books and other equiptment and I have had teacher friends who had to purchase supplies with their own money. Forget about any sort of special classes or tutoring sessions. Even advanced classes or college prep programs that would be staples in urban school districts would be missing. </p>

		<p>I teach hispanic students now, and 50% of them will work in class, the other 50% will do absolutely nothing, no matter what you do or what the school provides in the way of services.  </p>
<p>I had black students a few years ago.  90% did nothing, while the talented 10% did about 30% of the class requirements.</p>

		<p>The real danger here is two fold:</p>
<p>1.  If you treat the symptom, you can hold off for another generation on treating the underlying cause.  Genetics and Genomic Therapy could solve ALL of this, very quickly.  But needs some serious upfront investment to nail down the long sequence elements of DNA driven IQ.</p>
<p>2.  We are as we believe ourselves to be.  Jean Baptiste Lamarck believed that a giraffe gained a long neck by stretching to reach higher and higher leaves for generation after generation.  Modern evolutionary studies laughed at his &#8216;try a little hard and your children will grow longer necks&rsquo; approach to Darwinism.  Until we discovered the HAR-F1 gene which activates latent function and -alters- that function in scripting to the gonads.  i.e.  A cognitive and genital linked sequencer gene that could make the lie true.  If a black is bettered by a hispanic in work ethic and an asian in IQ and a white with some combination of the two, they have no reason to stretch a little harder.</p>
<p>If blacks are disenfranchised by hispanics at the bottom and asians at the top.  WE will catch the hell for it as they leave California for easier locales.  And blame us, their caretakers, for not &#8216;doing something about it&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it will not be UNTIL whites are a pluralitive minority that someone wakes up and asks to other key questions:</p>
<p>A.  Is anyone else truly equipped to do any better?  The percentage variance between Asian and White IQ suggests &#8216;not enough to matter&rsquo;.</p>
<p>B.  Will they care more than we do?  Show altruistic motive in sustaining the social enablements which at least keep society from being at racial throats?  All signs suggest no, they will have retained their own racist views, protected by &#8216;minority status&rsquo; and continue to push only those agendas which secure them against all _external_ threats.</p>
<p>And in particular for the Hispanics, you need only look at LA and the continuing displacement conflicts with blacks to realize that their agenda is one of utter extinction.  Within their own areas of influence.</p>
<p>America is dying, one inch at a time, because pity for Ethnies who have none for each other or us, is the excuse by which a strategy of invasion and supplantation hides, openly.</p>

		<p>In Vallejo, California, the drop-out rate is estimated to be 49%. Link:<br>
https://www.contracostatimes.com/news/ci_16805671?nclick_check=1<br>
 <br>
Let&rsquo;s celebrate the news.  Afterall, the higher the drop-out rate, the better for the rest of the students. The  underperforming students bring the following to high school campuses and classrooms: drugs, gangs, violence, foul language, stealing, bullying, aggression, disruption, disrespect, and other bad behavior. They contribute nothing positive, lower the quality of education for everyone, and are a factor in the fast burnout rate of otherwise great teachers. The sooner these types of students leave school, the better.<br>

		<p>Hello, this is my first post on this site. I have followed this forum for a few years in an effort to cleanse myself from the liberal indoctrination that is forced upon me by the school district which I work in.</p>
<p>First let me say that I cannot even access this site from my school computer. It is filtered under the category of &#8220;racism and hate&#8221;.</p>
<p>I teach at a high school that is considered one of the best in my state, one that students need to be accepted to in order to attend. Even at this school, when the bell rings, guess who is roaming the halls? CORRECT  &mdash;  -blacks!!! They are on their own bell schedule and will openly admit that they are in fact proud of it! They call it &#8220;CT&#8221; for colored time.</p>
<p>Again  &mdash;  -this is at one of the highest performing schools in our state. We are a success in spite of the blacks who are not expected to arrive to class on time. Imagine how hard the other students are working to win the race while dragging the minorities with them to the finish line.</p>
<p>Our success is NOT because of good teaching ( I also taught at one of the worse schools in our state and the teachers were better at that failing school)<br>
Our success is NOT because of good administrators.</p>
<p>Our success is because our mostly white and Asian students come from decent upbringing where their parents worked with them from a young age, teaching them the basics of proper social behavior, the three &#8220;R&rsquo;s&#8221; and so forth.</p>
<p>Im not saying genetics doesn&rsquo;t play a role, it certainly does, but I feel that our society pampers the blacks so much that there is no excuse for them to not perform. (of course its the pampering that has led to this stupidity).</p>
<p>Funny thing happens too- when I have pizza and doughnuts for the kids on special occasions (a few times a year)  &mdash;  guess who forgets about colored time  &mdash;  -yep, the blacks- first in line for the goodies  &mdash;  most of them are not even my students. You should see the dust fly off their $300 shoes then.-unsuspecting whites and Asians, used to the &#8220;colored time&#8221; are thrown off guard by the quick pace of the usually lethargic blacks and wonder if there is an emergency-only to find the doughnut giveaway was the reason. </p>
<p> To top it off, every so often the facility meetings driven by the liberal administration try to force feed cultural diversity down our throats as an excuse for why blacks cannot perform. This cultural diversity bit only leads me to believe in the unintended theory that blacks can only be successful in a tribal setting. If you really listen to the liberal argument about cultural diversity, they are really saying that blacks do not belong in our modern society! Thanks for letting me post. I have decided to speak my mind instead of being scared of what the liberals think. In the past few years, I have watched everything in our society take a nose-dive. I wish I could identify myself, but the libs I work for dont believe in free speech and the economy is tight.</p>
<p>Thanks for all that you guys do. Amren has always been a light beam in the darkness of liberal stupidity for those, like me, who work in the belly of the beast.<br>

		<p>Poster #21 - are you my clone?</p>
<p>I have experience the exact same things in the high schools that I&rsquo;ve worked in.  </p>
<p>#1 The diversity professional &#8216;development&rsquo; trainings are a big kumbaya joke.  What NaQuan is making strange animal noises in the corner and throws books and papers out the window every day?  &#8220;You just need to differentiate more!&#8221;  What?  That kid over there is literally mute and unresponsive, like in a comatose (drugged-out) state?  What strategies have you tried with multiple intelligences?  The examples go on and on.</p>
<p>#2  I had the exact same experience when it came to the food issues.  My classes at my previous school were 70% latino and 30% black.  While not all of the latinos had good home training, enough of them did to at least set the tone for the other latinos.  The black students, yes they operated on &#8216;colored time&rsquo; DAILY.  I remember the first (and last) time I gave my class a pizza party.  At the start of class, the black students RUSHED like maniacs into the room and at the pizza boxes.  It was so surreal.  The latino students were also dumbstuck with mouths agape.  Then a CROWD of black kids who were not in that class rushed in and took slices and ran.  I had enough presence of mind to grab at three of the boxes and pull them away so my latino students could get one slice each, but it was terrible.  Some other teachers who had happened by when the blacks were dispersing saw what was going on and attempted to reason with some of the thugs in the hallway, as they carried 2-3 slices each.  To no avail.</p>

		<p>In response to the previous posting, I am also a high school teacher. By far the best school I ever taught at was 90 percent Asian. White kids today are too focused on texting in class, using facebook, and concerned about who&rsquo;s dating who. Asian kids are the only serious ones entirely focused on their studies. Discipline problems in an Asian school are virtually zero. They study ten times harder than whites. Yet liberals keep claiming &#8220;minorities&#8221; cannot succeed because tests are culturally &#8220;biased&#8221; towards whites&hellip;..why do Asians perform so much better than the so called &#8220;advantaged whites&#8221;?</p>
