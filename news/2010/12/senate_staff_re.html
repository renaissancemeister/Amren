<h1>Senate Staff Researcher Suspended Over Anti-Obama E-Mail</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Juliana D. Norwood, Our Weekly (Los Angeles), December 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>According to the Associated Press (AP), Louisiana State Senate researcher Tammy Crain-Waldrop was recently suspended without pay, after sending an e-mail to hundreds of government workers apparently trying to show President Barack Obama depicted as a White man with pale skin, blue eyes and fine brown hair. </p>
<p>The e-mail said &#8220;Do you like him any better now? No? Me neither.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then you&rsquo;re not a racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The e-mail was an effort to show that anybody who doesn&rsquo;t support the president, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be a racist, and that Obama&rsquo;s being Black holds no bearing on the dislike.</p>
<p>Several African-American government employees who received the e-mail replied expressing how offensive the message was.</p>
<p>Immediately after the original message was sent, Crain-Waldrop sent another message apologizing and saying she sent it to the state capitol e-mail box by mistake, but she was still suspended without pay pending an investigation.</p>

		<p>How many of those black staffers sent around pictures of Bush as a monkey?? Ohh but that was ok right, because blacks can&rsquo;t be racist, only whites can be. If the roles were reversed you MIGHT get an apology from a black, most likely an excuse, which is more than enough to satisfy the liberals. But the white gets fired. </p>

		<p><i> Several African-American government employees who received the e-mail replied expressing how offensive the message was.</i></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t we mean <i>claiming</i> they found the image offensive?</p>
<p>I wonder if George Bush (either one) was ever depicted as a black man? If so, then I&rsquo;ll bet that was &#8220;offensive&#8221; to blacks too.</p>
<p>In any event, I LOLed when I saw the image, even tho the color is not quite right. That&rsquo;s more of a pale beige, the color you paint the guest bedroom. Also, I don&rsquo;t know if Obama would be photographed wearing a flag pin. Or was that just during the election?</p>

		<p>lol  Even trying to prove you&rsquo;re not a racist is racist. Especially that. The only way to win is not to play the game. Well, there&rsquo;s no way to win, that&rsquo;s why you shouldn&rsquo;t play. This fool should have known that. Or at least if he couldn&rsquo;t shut up, he should have simply been pro-white. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t get it; how is this offensive? It is racist to oppose Obama and it is offensive to say that you wouldn&rsquo;t like him even if here were white? What do they want from us here? Don&rsquo;t a lot of Blacks accuse Obama of being White anyway? I seriously don&rsquo;t get it.</p>

		<p>This is how your president would make himself appear if he were born and living in a white male dominated society: Minimizing his African ancestry, and maximizing his Caucasian appearance . Of course, he would not be the POS, more likely a teacher or neighbourhood lawyer.</p>

		<p>The fact is that there is nothing beneficial about demeaning the office of the presidency whether it be Bush, Clinton, Obama etc&hellip;  </p>
<p>The staffer should have been fired. There is no jusitifcation to defend this sort of behavior.</p>

		<p>No Roger, the FACT is that blacks have been working for decades to deny freedom of speech, deny freedom of association, deny freedom to keep the fruits of your labor for the benefit of your own family not theirs,  destroy the merit system upon which all successful societies depend, and they inject ALL discourse with racial animosity.  THAT is what should offend and enrage you.  By the way folks, the &#8220;offender&#8221; was a FEMALE.<br/>
Not a &#8220;he&#8221;.  At any rate, if we allow blacks to remove freedom of speech and thought from even within the Senate and Congressional offices, HOW IN THE WORLD CAN WE EXPECT ANYTHING GOOD OR LOGICAL TO COME OUT OF THOSE OFFICES????  What comes out of those offices affects ALL OF US.  WHY do we let a perpetually disgruntled single race dictate to the entire country every facet of our lives, thoughts, and discussions?  THAT is what should have enraged you Roger.</p>

		<p>(Actually, the doctored picture makes Obama look more like Jimmy Carter.)</p>
<p>The state researcher was foolish to send the email, but there are many such foolish emails, every day.</p>
<p>State employees owe the President of the USA no loyalty or fealty. It would be appropriate for a Federal employee to be called on the carpet for discussing the President in these terms, but state employees owe him nothing.</p>
<p>Maybe now, Tammy will take her work a bit more seriously and not use the state email to broadcast humor. Her boss will naturally feel she does not have enough work to do&hellip;..and everything will have a happy ending.</p>
<p>Some people can learn the easy way, by listening, and others have to learn the hard way.</p>

What do they &#8220;want&#8221; from us? They (blacks and other aggrieved minorities that hate whitey) want us to be gone! It&rsquo;s that simple. Anything we say or do is perceived as &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>So now the offending party will be subjected to further diversity indoctrination in order to appease the black and hispanic racist who were do offended by this e-mail.<br/>

		<p>Pull your heads out people, it was a woman who sent the email.</p>
<p>Assuming she wasn&rsquo;t just begging for attention (and got the wrong kind), it took even more guts for her to do this than it would a man because women are supposed to, you know, &#8216;be sensitive to other&rsquo;s vulnerabilities&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We should get behind her and let her know we understand and appreciate her rational logic because she is one of the few females that doesn&rsquo;t equate her own weaknesses to a victim status that should be shared by all others.</p>
<p>And no, the office of President is not something akin to King where you represent the country as much as yourself.  Your value lies in your ideas and their synchronicity with the beliefs of the people who elected you.  If you lose that polity&rsquo;s faith, you should be just as much subject to derison as any other citizen in forming a block opinion necessary to assure your removal.  No one is &#8216;elected by god&rsquo; here&hellip;</p>
<p>Go Tammy!  Apologize for _nothing_.</p>
