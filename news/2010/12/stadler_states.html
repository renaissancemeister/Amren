			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Trevor Loudon, New Zeal Blogspot, December 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tolerance is a commendable virtue, but honesty is even more important.</p>
<p>Austrian Member of Parliament Ewald Stadler, is bluntly honest in his rebuttal of Turkish criticism of alleged poor treatment of Turkish immigrants by Austria.</p>
<p>Some societies are better than others. Some cultures are respectful and tolerant of individuals than others. That is a fact.</p>
<p>Tolerant and open societies should not put up with criticism from nations with far poorer human rights records.</p>
<p>Ewald Stadler seems to understand that. If only more western politicians did, we would all be better off.</p>

		<p>Bravo Ewald! Its edifying to see that the German speaking <br>
nations havent given up their identity despite being endlessly lectured about being &#8220;Nazis&#8221;..its just this pride that will save them..whereas the tolerant over intellectualized French are doomed.<br>

		<p>I would be in favor of revising the U.S. Constitution if it would allow someone like Ewald Stadler (as opposed to say, Arnold Schwarzenegger) to become President of the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t even imagine the uproar if someone touched a muslim imam or some other religiously estemmed muslim - it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to call them &#8220;spiritual&#8221; leaders anyway-&#8220;</p>
<p>Man!  You could hear this guy chomping at the bit!  No doubt the only reason he held back was because if he really let loose, the lefties would have had him dragged out in handcuffs for a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;.  No matter, the message got through, loud and clear.</p>
<p>There still appears to be some life left in places like Austria and Hungary.  Let&rsquo;s hope this spark of anger soon mushrooms into a bonfire of outrage across Europe!  Bravo, Herr Stadler!</p>

		<p>Yesterdays related report, &#8220;WikiLeaks: France has not integrated its minorities&#8221; (Dec. 6) reveals four cables from U. S. diplomatic officials in France back to the State Department with such observations as:</p>
<p>&#8220;The real problem is the failure of white Christian France to view its dark-skinned and Muslim compatriots as citizens in their own right.&#8221; </p>
<p>Bud, in his comment number 21, reminded us that all the while the George W. Bush was &#8220;pushing hard at the time to have Turkey accepted as a European country.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a difference between the breath-taking stupidity of GOP nitwits like Bush   &mdash;  - who, thankfully, Europeans ignored on the question of Turkey&rsquo;s membership in the EU   &mdash;  - and MP Oswald Stadler!</p>

		<p>That was quite amazing to watch.  Especially the applause he got from his colleagues.  Hopefully, others will learn from him to be more outspoken.</p>

		<p>Stadler is a nice enough guy; in fact, he had been a TV ombudsman for years and was rather popular before the FPÖ shanghaied him. So he´s not a career politician. That´s good. He is a bit headstrong though - on other occasions he´ll stab you in the back with an extremely PC position with the same nonchalance if he believes in it.</p>
<p>Still, I´d like to see more like him :)</p>

		<p>I am tired of these third worlders sneaking over some fence or sea that have no idea what a light switch is and DEMANDING that they are let in.  Someone needs to tell them that civil rights is not a global right, and human rights do not constitute going to whichever white country wherever and whenever you want for welfare, selling drugs, and raping white teens.</p>
<p>There is one thing we should be a little proud of.  All of these countries letting in these third world muslims that have HAD to interact with them cannot stand them and want them gone.  The politicians are slow to follow and change.  But they will.  And if they do not, another party will step in and take their place among the people and these old multicultural parties will go the way of the Whig (party).</p>
<p>Either that or another civil war in about thirty white countries.  And even at that, after we have won, our NEW constitutions will permanently ban muslims and non europeans.</p>
<p>Constant exposure to dangers will breed contempt for them - Seneca The Younger</p>

		<p>&#8220;Tolerance is a commendable virtue&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps, perhaps not! &#8220;Tolerance&#8221; is a meaningless term unless what is to be tolerated is specified. The liberals bloviate about tolerance without clearly specifying what should be tolerated. Note that the liberals show zero tolerance for those who oppose the liberal agenda.</p>
<p>Liberals also use the terms like &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;hate&#8221; in the same manner. Social psychologists classify these terms as stimuli for conditioned reflexes. When liberal conditioned Americans hear or read these terms, they manifest the response that liberals want them to. </p>

		<p>Why in hell should Eurpean White nations stupidly allow themselves to be invaded by Muslims or third-worlders regardless of what religion they claim to adhere to? Islam was unable to conquer and take Europe by force centuries ago. Now their tactic is to resort to peaceful invasion via legal (or illegal immigration), then engage in rat-like overbreeding in hopes of eventually outnumbering the native Europeans. While, of course, their rat-like overbreeding is supported by native European taxpayers. The same tactic practiced by America&rsquo;s illegal Latino immigrants.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see the Western white world toughen up, too!  I&rsquo;m tired of our lands being invaded by people who take advantage of us and then whine about our culture and constantly accuse us of making their lives hard.  Since we don&rsquo;t want you (third world immigrants) and you don&rsquo;t like us, let&rsquo;s have a divorce</p>

		<p>Wow - what a great speech?</p>
<p>However, people shouldn&rsquo;t go all out on Turkey as the main enemy - as the Turkish Secular Republic is an excellent system for Western European white Nations with growing poor, NW Muslim populations.</p>
<p>Under the secular republic set up by Turkish nationalist hero Kemal Ataturk - Turkey has a &#8220;democratic&#8221; republican system of government with very strong restrictions on (Muslim) Religious groups/individuals causing any trouble. Turkey looks to Europe for economics and culture and the Turkish army is given the explicit duty to defend the secular republic and that means desolving the &#8220;democratic&#8221; government and arresting/killing religious groups/people who cause trouble.</p>
<p>Can anyone imagine some White Western European country&rsquo;s military doing a coup to arrest and kill Muslim trouble makers like all the ones doing so now in Merry Old England? Well, Turkey&rsquo;s military has done many coups since the 1950s.</p>
<p>Holland, England and France should vote to become official &#8220;Secular Republics&#8221; banning activities like mass public prayers, women in veils etc. Few Christians try to do this in Europe these days, so anti religious laws will be aimed exclusively against NW Muslims.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Some societies are better than others. Some cultures are  more respectful and tolerant of individuals than others. That is a fact. Tolerant and open societies should not put up with criticism from nations with far poorer human rights records.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is amazing is not what Ewald Stadler is saying or the fact that it is being applauded (as Jewamongyou and others are pointing out,) but the fact that the West has come to such a point of feckless wretchedness, that such sanity is seen as &ldquo;amazing&rdquo; at all. And this criticism is hardly directed at anyone here or Ewald Stadler in the very least, but at the West as a civilization on a joyride of suicide as a whole. When Ewald Stadler speaks of &ldquo;tolerance romantics&rdquo; and &ldquo;diversity babble,&rdquo; and what it has lead to, he is only stating the obvious. This is like myself or anyone else here being applauded for stating that the sky is normally blue or that the grass is normally green, as opposed to orange and purple respectively. It is a fact, end of story!</p>
<p>That Turks in Austria or Mexicans in the USA are alien; that they are encouraged to remain alien by both their former governments and ours; and that this leads to social chaos and destruction, and not &ldquo;enrichment&rdquo; and &ldquo;strength,&rdquo; is equally obvious. It does not take a PhD in psychology or history to figure that out, let alone a media job or political office. That is why the issues of &ldquo;immigration&rdquo; and &ldquo;integration,&rdquo; are so frustratingly laughable; they have only negative results when layered with an obnoxious multicultural icing, and everything else that is applied so &ldquo;sweetly&rdquo; to augment them, is as deadly as a rotten tuna salad after five days in the sun.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>
