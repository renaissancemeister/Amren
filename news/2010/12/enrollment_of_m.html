			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William Wan, Washington Post, December 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the past few years, enrollment of Muslim students such as Shabnan has spiked at Catholic campuses across the country. Last year, Catholic colleges had an even higher percentage of Muslim students than the average four-year institution in the United States, according to the Higher Education Research Institute. The influx has astonished and sometimes befuddled administrators. Some Catholic campuses are creating prayer rooms for new Muslim students and hiring Islamic chaplains to minister to them. Others are unsure how to adapt.</p>
<p>One of the sharpest increases in Muslims students has been at Catholic University in Northeast Washington. In the past five years, as the number of self-identified Catholics on the campus has decreased, the number of Muslims has more than doubled, from 41 in 2006 to 91 this fall.</p>
<p>The largest group of international students by far now comes from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Muslim students say they enroll at Catholic schools for many of the same reasons as their classmates: attractive campuses, appealing professors and academic programs that fit their interests. But there is also a spiritual attraction to the values that overlap the two faiths.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it is an overtly religious place, it&rsquo;s not strange or weird to care about your religion here, to pray and make God a priority,&#8221; said Shabnan, a political science major who often covers her head with a pale beige scarf. &#8220;They have the same values we do.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>A place to pray</b></p>
<p>Echoing Islam&rsquo;s conservative culture, the school separates men and women in its dorms and imposes visiting hours. The university prohibits sex before marriage. Daily prayer and periodic fasting are common concepts.</p>
<p>At the same time, Muslim students find themselves immersed in what can seem at times alien iconography. Almost every classroom is adorned with a crucifix. Statues of the Virgin Mary and Holy Child dot the campus. Professors often open their classes with an appeal to Jesus. Courses in theology are an undergraduate requirement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But there are also drawbacks to being Muslim on an overwhelmingly Catholic campus.</p>
<p>Most of the students eat everything but the pork in the student union. For the more orthodox, eating can be a tricky proposition that involves driving as far as Potomac to find halal meat, which is slaughtered according to strict guidelines.</p>
<p>Although other Catholic schools have established prayer rooms and student associations for their growing Muslim populations, Catholic University has neither. For their five daily prayers, Muslims often scramble to find empty classrooms where they can kneel, face Mecca and bow before God.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>An adjustment</b></p>
<p>During his more than four years as a graduate student at Catholic, Ali Basiri has become one of the regulars at the small chapel in Caldwell Hall, the oldest building on campus. Basiri, 27, has spent so much time in the chapel&rsquo;s pews that he has befriended the organist who practices there.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He has struck up friendships with equally fervent Catholic believers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do this thing where he teaches me his prayers in Arabic, and I share with him the prayers I say as a Catholic,&#8221; said one of his friends, Kenny White, 20, a sophomore from Annapolis. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve learned about God by learning about him and his own faith. It&rsquo;s been a really important and beautiful part of being here.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Proud of who we are&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>It was that kind of exchange that prompted Basiri&rsquo;s attempts to start a Muslim student association. He wanted to help Muslim students connect and gather for prayer in addition to helping spur conversations across religions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Then, an administrator pulled him aside and said it wouldn&rsquo;t work to have a Muslim group at such a major Catholic institution.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many other Catholic schools with rising numbers of Muslim students have set up prayer rooms and formed Muslim student associations.</p>
<p>Georgetown University, whose Muslim student numbers have also been climbing, has a prayer room, student association and an entire center devoted to Muslim-Christian understanding, and the school hired a full-time Muslim chaplain in 1999. Catholic administrators at colleges that have added similar features say they haven&rsquo;t perceived the efforts as a challenge to their religious identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not going to take down the cross or change our name. We&rsquo;re proud of who we are,&#8221; said Marco Masini, associate vice president of student life at Benedictine University in Illinois. &#8220;Hospitality is a part of the Benedictine philosophy, so it&rsquo;s important we welcome individuals of all faiths.&#8221;</p>

		<p>In France Muslims now make up about 10 percent of all pupils at Catholic schools, and in some areas, like Marseille, they are often in majority:</p>
<p>&rdquo;Marseille, France  &mdash;  The bright cafeteria of St. Mauront Catholic School is conspicuously quiet: It is Ramadan, and 80 percent of the students are Muslim. When the lunch bell rings, girls and boys stream out past the crucifixes and the large wooden cross in the corridor, heading for Muslim midday prayer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s very important for people who allow wife-beating, killing converts, and stoning women to death for being alone with a male non-relative, to make certain they eat properly slaughtered food, like lambs.<br/>

		<p>&ldquo;Hospitality is a part of the Benedictine philosophy, so it&rsquo;s important we welcome individuals of all faiths.&rdquo;: Sure, but I wonder if they would be so welcome if the students didn&rsquo;t have their acedemic career paid for in full?  Of course, what the Catholic schools are failing to understand is that they are being invaded by a foreign force that has the goal of eventually displacing all Christians. Or, maybe they do understand what is happening, but have just enough greed and arrogance to think it won&rsquo;t happen to them&hellip; that someone else will stop the Islamists&hellip; that it&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s problem, etc.</p>

		<p>Generous scholarships from the Saudi Ministry of Higher Education make this possible.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has a population of just 20 million. It recently launched the &#8216;King Abdallah University of Science and Technology&rsquo;, to improve the education of select citizens.</p>
<p>Sending their children to the West to learn English and attend our schools is a long-term strategic move on their part. The US, UK and Canada have been the most popular destinations. </p>
<p>Almost 18,000 Saudi nationals were studying abroad in 2006, with as many as half on paid scholarships.  President Bush assisted the Saudi government to award 5000 scholarships for Saudi&rsquo;s to enrol in US institutions.</p>

		<p>Do they squat on the toilets?  Do they require foot baths or separate restrooms from non-Muslims?  Are their women forbidden to be in public with non-muslims without escorts or without veil?</p>
<p>I am not a Christian but it would seem to me that the choice between accomodation of Muslims at one religious institution and having them create their own schools _here_ is no real choice at all.</p>
<p>Indeed, the real question for me here is that, with such a conservative set of religious doctrines to follow as the Wahabist sect of Sharia in Saudi, why these students or their parents want to be exposed to an alien religion -or- the supposed foulness of American culture?</p>
<p>The only thing that comes immediately to mind for me is that &#8216;student associations&rsquo; on a religiously controlled campus of another faith would be an excellent means for terrorist plotting to go unnoticed and unsurveilled.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but there is simply no reason to extend a hand to these people.  Their faith is historically not one of peace.  A huge number of their adherents _world wide_ (Islam is now the largest religion) cheered when the Trade Center fell.  And 18 of the 26 terrorists involved were in fact FROM the center of this religion&rsquo;s historical root: in Saudi.</p>
<p>Where, from the mid 7th century genocide onwards, neither a Christian nor a Jew nor a Buddhist can practice their religion or even carry their version of a holy book, lest they be beaten to a pulp, legally, by the Mutaween.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s disgusting.  If I was dean of a Catholic university, I&rsquo;d run every Moslem (and in fact, every Protestant, atheist, and Jew) off my campus for good.  I&rsquo;m not even Catholic, but I can&rsquo;t understand why a Catholic university would find the acceptance of non-Catholic students acceptable.  Then again, I don&rsquo;t understand why black universities allow so many whites and others, to where now only one-half of their student body is black, on average.  You would think they&rsquo;d try harder to be truly &#8220;black.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yea, and the sun never sets on the British Empire.  What fools.  Have they not forgotten that these Islamic lands these people come from were once Christian lands.  What happened to the Christians of Algeria, Libya, Egypt, and Morrocco? Hippo on the North African coast was the home of St. Augustine the Great.  It took hundreds of years for the Christians to throw off the yoke of Islamic invaders in Spain, Greece, and the Balkans.  How the fools have forgotten and only repeat these mistakes here. The Christianity of our forefathers is not the Christianity practiced to today.  It is a meek watered down neo-marxist humanistic pscyo-babble.  We need to return to the faith of our fathers, a strong paternalistic Christianity with its full force and desire to preserve and protect its followers.  The El Cids and the Charles Martels who fought under the banner of Christianity against those who wished to destroy us.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed this phenomenon even in the Catholic high schools.  How much longer will it be before these Catholic schools become Muslim schools, very much like some churches I&rsquo;ve seen turn into mosques?  If we don&rsquo;t wake up fast, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time till we no longer have a country.<br/>

Jesus was very clear that His religion was not multicultural:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the way, the truth, and the light. No one comes to the Father but through Me&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s odd that those who profess to be Christians don&rsquo;t even understand what their religion requires of them.</p>

<p>May I (as one of the lone clerics who posts here) interject?</p>
<p>First off, if I remember my parochial education, Islam and true Catholicism (of either Eastern or Western varieities) is inimically OPPOSED to Islam, PRECISELY because they worship a) a different God (that is no god, as St. Paul points out in his epistles) b) they are heathens (as various popes, patriarchs, and prophets have corroborated) and c) they are NOT of the race of Christendom, but are INVADERS. A number of Crusades, Lepanto, Ronceveaux, et al. should forever clarify the HISTORIC Catholic position.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re talking about post-Vatican II religion&hellip; Maybe today&rsquo;s Catholicism &#8216;lite&rsquo; might not be the religion that once said it was &#8216;semper edeam&rsquo; (always the same), when compared to Charlemagne, Sobieski, the Holy Roman Empire, and all the rest&hellip;.</p>
<p>Could be.</p>

		<p>Why would Muslims want to study in Christian schools? Don&rsquo;t they have their own schools? I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t want to study in a Muslim school.</p>
<p>The only reason I think they&rsquo;d want to do that is so they can hit on white girls.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Footbaths&#8221; were installed at the University of Michigan.  I find that these &#8220;footbaths&#8221; make dandy urinals, one&rsquo;s &#8220;aim&#8221; not having to be quite as precise.<br/>
I have NEVER been challenged by any muslims on my use of these &#8220;footbaths&#8221;.<br/>
If I am challenged, I will merely tell them that in MY country, these &#8220;footbaths&#8221; are urinals.<br/>
There is NO SUCH THING as a &#8220;moderate&#8221; muslim.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, Christian and Jewish schools are legally prohibited from excluding non-Christian/non-Jewish students from their education establishments as a result of Marxist politically correct European Union legislation during the course of the last 25 to 30 years or so.</p>
<p>Muslim schools, however, are inherently safeguarded from non-Muslim intake (or more aptly, <i>invasion</i>) if only because few, if any, non-Muslim parents would feel at ease about sending their offspring to any such institutions for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>While the white Western world continues its membership of the non-White dominated United Nations and allows Marxists/Zionists/Muslims to control the political and judicial arenas of the West, Christian/Jewish schools will remain unable to exclude alien religous adherents even each other, from any of their institutions.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, the present political and judicial setup as aforementioned, must be dismantled and permanently destroyed, and replaced by indigenous White ethnonationalist systems of government and judiciary by whatever means necessary before the root causes currently responsible for the ongoing collapse of Western civilisation can begin to be tackled at all.</p>
<p>The fact that 80% of the Catholic school studentship is non-White Muslim and tellingly also in tune with demographic advantage, some of these aliens have had the outrageous audacity to raise objections to a crucifix and other religious icons present in the Chapel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s high time non-Muslim faith schools got together and formed powerful lobbying groups to keep Muslims out of their sacred institutions altogether, in view of the nature and end goal of the Mohammedan cult in the first instance. </p>
