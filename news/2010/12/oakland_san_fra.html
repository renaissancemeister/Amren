			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chip Johnson, San Francisco Chronicle, December 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When it comes to the public schools, Bay Area parents rarely illustrate the strident, progressive beliefs they apply to most political and social issues.</p>
<p>The phrase limousine liberal is not complimentary, but on this issue, it&rsquo;s a glove that fits a little too well.</p>
<p>Because whether it&rsquo;s fueled by economic privilege or simply a matter of choice, the rate at which Bay Area parents, regardless of ethnicity, send their children to private schools has historically been higher than most other places in the country, say researchers who have studied the issue.</p>
<p>And at inner-city schools, that migration has translated into an exodus of white students from the public school systems in both Oakland and San Francisco.</p>
<p>Similar numbers are reflected in school districts in Stockton and Sacramento as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Separate has never meant equal in this country, and we&rsquo;re seeing the legacy of that because when you segregate, these typical patterns usually follow,&#8221; said Janelle Scott, an assistant professor of education at UC Berkeley. She has researched school choice as it pertains to civil rights, race and equity.</p>
<p>Often against stiff resistance, San Francisco has made attempts to re-distribute students across district schools by offering parents a choice and establishing magnet schools for students whose first language is Mandarin, Cantonese or Japanese. The district also created a &#8220;diversity index&#8221; based on nine ethnic and cultural variables.</p>
<p>In Oakland, a city of nearly 400,000 residents whose population is nearly one-third Caucasian, the issue is even more dramatic. Officials estimate there are 70,000 school-aged children living in Oakland. But only 39,000 kids are enrolled in the public school system. Ninety-five percent of the enrollees are students of color.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For the current academic year, there are 92 white public high school seniors in the district&rsquo;s graduating class of more than 3,400 students. </p>
<p>Historically, by the time Oakland students reach high school, the Caucasian student population is cut in half, to about 3 percent of the district&rsquo;s overall student population, said Troy Flint, a spokesman for the Oakland Unified School District.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It would be unfair to blame parents for merely trying to find the best education possible for their children, because that&rsquo;s one of the main duties of a responsible parent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the duty of Oakland schools to provide a reasonable assortment of education choices for students, and that&rsquo;s not happening in an equitable way across the district.</p>

		<p>Where I&rsquo;m at, most whites are also hopelessly liberal, but drive past any public school in this city and there is a 99% chance you won&rsquo;t see a single white face except for the teachers.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t know why nobody shoves this in front of liberals and forces them to admit their &#8216;latent racism.&rsquo;  There are so many ways to expose liberal hypocrisy, yet none of our national or local American-first activists hound them on these things.</p>

		<p>Seems like its time to have an affirmative action program to attract whites to these schools (btw whites are a minority in California).  Such a program would have courses that white kids like - English, social studies, math and science maybe art.  A few advanced placement programs based on merit as well.  And assure them a safe and well-behaved environment.  <br>
What the planners haven&rsquo;t grasped is that the better abled, are better educated and have better behavioral patterns.  Consequently they want the same winning formula for their kids.  Further, those factors provide the parents with better paying jobs and hence mobility to move to areas with like-minded people, be it a school district or private school.</p>

		<p>Chip Johnson is an excellent journalist.He is a black conservative who tells it like it is.White parents send their kids to private schools, paying huge amounts of mooloah in property taxes to support school systems that are afrocentric and anti white, because all of the elected bueacrats cater to the afrocentrists who dictate to them how the schools are run.Looong time ago I went to SF schools that were fairly decent, even if the black kids may have felt a little awkward in them.<br>

		<p>Sigh.  33% of the city population is Anglo and yet 6% of the schoolchildren are.  The tragedy of our people in a nutshell and we are undoubtedly paying for other ethnies to have 3-4 or more of their own.</p>
<p>Of course it takes a black woman-</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/NWt8E</p>
<p>To make it all about &#8216;segregation and equality&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Just as it takes an asian to comment that-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
It&rsquo;s also the duty of Oakland schools to provide a reasonable assortment of education choices for students, and that&rsquo;s not happening in an equitable way across the district.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our research, what we hear from parents who are making choices for the betterment of all kinds of kids is they want the district to offer academic plans that work for them,&#8221; Seyer-Ochi said.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Which inevitably translates to &#8220;Let us chase the whites to better places or we&rsquo;ll cry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem being there wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if there were no foreign ethnies having huge numbers of low IQ children and then wondering why whites choose not simply location but _lifestyle_ which reflects a K-breeding philosophy of dedicating one&rsquo;s resources rather than locusting the landscape with many.</p>
<p>I keep hearing Kruschyev: &#8220;We will bury you!&#8221; running through the back of my mind-</p>

<p>No translation necessary?!  Why that can&rsquo;t be America!  Look at all those young white kids!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, when you test the races separately they&rsquo;re never equal! It&rsquo;s only when you lump them all together and test them as a group that you can claim they&rsquo;re all performing equally badly. </p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be unfair to blame parents for merely trying to find the best education possible for their children, because that&rsquo;s one of the main duties of a responsible parent.</p>

<p><br>
I like reading about this kind of stuff. It&rsquo;s so humorous. Forget the liberal hypocrisy for a moment and think: Like George Bailey telling Mr. Potter, &ldquo;You own the public schools, got all the administrators in your back pocket, but those private schools are our of your reach! And it&rsquo;s gnawing at you isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Hahaha</p>
<p>At least the author gives me that impression. It burns Chip there to know that those ARE private schools without government funding or interference (because of the law), which allows them their self-governing and with the ability to dictate what they want and what they&rsquo;ll allow. Sad for the liberals to believe they can force their whims on everyone when they can&rsquo;t, hypocritical (self explanatory in the article), ridiculous to believe whites will put up with this nonsense (thus exodus), but sweet to know there&rsquo;s still some damn freedom of choice left in this country!<br>

		<p>The real racist inequity in this country is this:  White parents must pay for the education of black children (through their taxes) and must in addition pay all over again for the private education of their own children, if they want their children to actually learn something and not be at risk of assault.<br>

<p>couldnt be an Asian element in there somewhere?!<br>
I actually live in Australia but spend a few days in the Bay area<br>
six  month ago (after a 23yr hiatus) and couldnt help noticing<br>
the increase in Asian population along with Vancouver in Canada<br>
I wonder if the fact that these cities have a lower black/hispanic population than a lot of other major US cities <br>
is driving Asian immigration to these areas&hellip;from my past experience I would have to say definitely yes!<br>
Asians are much more racially conscious but more subtle than whites in expressing a racial awareness regarding where they<br>
live,send kids to school etc.<br>
For example I had a young Japanese doctor working here<br>
àt a city  hospital here   recently tell me he came here with his  family to work and live here instead of going to Chicago for `safety reasons&#8220;    <br>
Let&rsquo;s see if anyone can figure out what `safety reasons` are?</p>

		<p>Poster #6, &#8216;Sue&rsquo; states that she works at a prestigious private school in San Jose, CA. She says that a large percentage of their pupils are &#8220;minority&#8221; and score better than the white kids. She wonders why this is. I think I know the school she is talking about. When I drive by the school I do not see any blacks or mestizos. Most of the students pass an exam before they&rsquo;re admitted. The tuition is high which means that the parents are not uneducated unemployed single moms. The &#8220;minorities&#8221; that Sue is talking about at her school tend to be Asian or from India. Some of the students recently won special national awards in science. Darned if every single one wasn&rsquo;t Asian. If this private academy stopped charging blacks and metizos tuition and didn&rsquo;t require them to pass any admittance requirments   &mdash;  - how many of these &#8220;new&#8221; students would win any science awards Sue?</p>

<p>Few possibilities:</p>
<p>1) The minorities you&rsquo;re referring to are overwhelmingly Asian.<br>
2) The school fudges the scores/curves them.<br>
3) Hispanics are included in in the White category.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll take a stab at figuring out what your secret is in your PRIVATE school, Sue.</p>
<p>Stringent entrance exams, high tuition (ensuring students come from educated families), school dress codes, strictly enforced behavioral codes, and merit based only test structures?  In short, whatever minorities you have are NOT the standard dis-interested gang banger thug found in every public school.  Moreover, through your entrance testing, even targeting mainly minorities, you would get the upper two percent of IQ from those minorities and the high tuition rate would ensure the parents kept on top of the kids to do well after admission.  The behavioral standards would ensure any unwilling or disruptive kid would be quickly expelled and his seat given to somebody on a waiting list who DOES want to learn and has the IQ to do so.<br>
Would THAT all be your secret?</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s something going on now which so clearly signals the end of the United States as a successful nation, much less a world power, that if I weren&rsquo;t as old as I am now, I&rsquo;d get really upset.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s due to the public education system, kindergarten through college, that&rsquo;s been in place in the U.S. for the past 20 to 30 years.</p>
<p>So-called &#8220;students&#8221; are being brainwashed, from the earliest age, to think of white people as the only race capable of doing evil (and that&rsquo;s mainly only white men, of course, not really white women) and that minorities   &mdash;   especially so-called African-Americans   &mdash;   only fail due to the evil white man.  If left to their own devices, they&rsquo;d create a Paradise on Earth.</p>
<p>Of course, this includes those class assemblies, especially before MLK Day, where slave auctions are reenacted and the black kids in the audience get to sit there with those martyred expressions on their faces while the white kids are supposed to look down at the floor with great shame and embarrassment that they had the misfortune to be born into such an evil race.</p>
<p>I see so many young white people who have fallen for this Greatest Lie Ever Told, that they&rsquo;ve actually decided to model their lives on black people.</p>
<p>They figure white ways of thinking are inherently repressive, if not blatantly evil   &mdash;   and that black people are cool and understand life in profound ways.</p>
<p>Thus white women are having babies without the fathers being involved in the child&rsquo;s upbringing.  They&rsquo;re giving them &#8220;made up&#8221; names (the latest one I was told about is a poor little girl with no chance of a decent future being burdened with the name Kadentz for the rest of her life).  I&rsquo;ve even heard young white people purposely adopt the black dialect, including flinging in &#8220;You know whud I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;?&#8221; after every second or third utterance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over, folks.  And it&rsquo;s fun to complain about it all, but the writing is on the wall in great, big, black (very black) letters.  By 2100, the U.S.A. will only be written up in whatever history books will be written (if any) as this place where evil white people ruined the world for 300 years.</p>
<p>Of course, it will before then be a third-world country, ripe for invasion by China, so those books might be written in Chinese.</p>

<p>Sue, It is difficult to address you challenge as you haven&rsquo;t identified the school so that other factors can be considered.  However I suspect a private school that has a merit based admission program would have a high percentage of those going on to college.  Typically those able to afford private school come from families that have had financial success and value education   &mdash;   private schools are biased sample.  As for the high percentage going to college, the quality of college should be made clear as near anyone can go to some college in the US.  As for the only &#8220;20% is white&#8221;, it appears that either your school is not appreciated by whites or perhaps no appreciated by high performing whites, and/or you have a discriminatory admission policy.  Have you considered an affirmative action program for high performing whites, as you know whites are in the minority in California.</p>

		<p>Where is Chip Johnson getting this figure (Wikipedia?):</p>
<p><i>Oakland, a city of nearly 400,000 residents whose population is nearly one-third Caucasian.</i></p>
<p>According to Zipskinny.com, Oakland CA&rsquo;s demographics are:</p>
<p>Hispanic/Latino: 	49.6%<br>
White: 	7.5%<br>
Black: 	23.1% </p>
<p>I have a hard time believing that Oakland is one-third White, but then I only pass Oakland at 75 mph on the freeway (I accelerate through that area) during the day, with enough gas and with the car doors locked.</p>

<p>I work as a noon supervisor at a prestigious private school in San Jose- we are known for our extremely high test scores and our 99 percent college admission rate. Believe it or not, 80 percent of our student body is minority and only 20 percent is white. Does any AR reader dare take a stab at explaining this?</p>
<p>P.S. Our average minority scores about 10 points higher than our average white student.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if anyone can figure out what our secret is&hellip;.. <br>

Let me guess.  Nearly all of that 80 percent is east Asian. <br>
 <br>
Am I close?  </p>

		<p>The area where segregation made most sense was the first area where it was attacked legally: in public schools.  Blacks really are less intelligent, on the average than whites, and more violent. If these characteristics were due to &#8220;white racism,&#8221; they would be disappearing. They&rsquo;re not. They are due to genetic differences that have taken thousands of years to develop.    <br>
 <br>
Liberals destroy the careers of anyone who says that in public.  Their behavior demonstrates that they privately agree.   </p>

<p>Virtually all of our &#8220;minority population&#8221; is either East Asian or South Asian and they outnumber whites about 4:1. </p>
<p>No, we do NOT curve our tests, fudge our results, or discriminate against whites. It&rsquo;s just that the Asian parents value education and have smart, well behaved kids.</p>

		<p>#12 is correct, and more people should be bringing this up:  whites and Asians pay for the public school system in urban areas, while sending their own kids to private schools.  They have to pay twice to get their kids an education in a safe environment.</p>

<p><i>THE FACTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. THERE ARE MINORITY DOMINATED SCHOOLS THAT ARE BETTER THAN ALL WHITE SCHOOLS!</i></p>
<p>There are very few NAM (Non Asian Minority) schools that outperform White schools, when they do, it&rsquo;s only because the students have been chosen on a highly selective basis. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the numbers, as you say, for William Faria Elementary in Cupertino (Obtained from Greatschools.org an excellent tool to determine if you children will be diversified by Jamal and Jose..)</p>
<p>William Faria Elementary</p>
<p>African American or Black - Less than 1%<br>
Hispanic or Latino - Less than 1%<br>
Asian - 96%<br>
Filipino - Less than 1%</p>
<p>So no surprise, the vast majority of the &#8220;minorities&#8221; (an archaic term for much of the country..) are Asian. The subtext provided by Amren is that liberal Whites don&rsquo;t want to send their children to schools that are majority Hispanic or Black. So what&rsquo;s your point and how does it follow with our comments.? </p>

		<p>I used to be a school teacher in the public schools, therefore,</p>
<p>I have witnessed how Black students misbehave on a daily basis,</p>
<p>and when disruptive students are sent to the office, the</p>
<p>administrations are too meek and timid to enforce the </p>
<p>disciplinary rules that have been established.  I had a </p>
<p>conference with a Middle School principal and his female</p>
<p>assistant, and to begin the session, the female assistant,</p>
<p>in her mind, apparently wanted to make me appear in a dismal</p>
<p>light when she opened the discussion with these clever words,</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Habern, you write more DR&rsquo;s than any teacher in this</p>
<p>school.&#8221;  DR&rsquo;s are Disciplinary Reports.  What she failed to</p>
<p>realize, was the fact that she had just paid me the highest</p>
<p>compliment she could muster.  Writing Disciplinary Reports</p>
<p>are supposed to bring to the administration&rsquo;s attention, the</p>
<p>behavioral patterns of certain students, but most </p>
<p>adminstrators do not want to be bothered to correct the behavior </p>
<p>pattern for fear of parental suit.  In addition, I asked this</p>
<p>Middle School principal, how he planned of eliminating students</p>
<p>wearing hats in the hallway and in the classroom, using their</p>
<p>cell-phones in class, and listening to their music devices in</p>
<p>class.  This Middle School Principal, at this point, became</p>
<p>very disturbed and uttered these words of wisdom, &#8220;Mr. Habern,</p>
<p>you do not understand administrative procedures, there is the</p>
<p>door; this session has ended; you will never work in this</p>
<p>district again.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a typical example of how most schools are </p>
<p>administrated in the United States, and therefore I can speak </p>
<p>from experience when I say most schools, because I used to </p>
<p>Substitute Teach in at least 10 schools in the same time period.</p>
<p>School Administrators are the problem in the United States.</p>
<p>Corporal Punishment is no longer a factor integrated into the</p>
<p>American school as a form of punishment for misbehaving </p>
<p>students to at least act as a deterrent, therefore, students</p>
<p>and parents are running the schools, with administrators</p>
<p>dancing to the tune of both for obvious reasons, therefore,</p>
<p>until a better sense of discipline has returned to the</p>
<p>classroom, American schools will appear to fail, along with</p>
<p>their student clientele, which is the prime factor that can</p>
<p>be observed as the reason for the failure of the United States.</p>
<p>It only follows, that a country that maintaines a weak sense</p>
<p>of discipline in all instutions, is a country that is doomed</p>
<p>to fail.  This is a simple equation that Liberals fail to view</p>
<p>the value.  The pendulum must eventually swing in the opposite</p>
<p>direction, if the United States is further maintain Her status </p>
<p>on the planet as the world leader.  Therefore, the emphasis</p>
<p>on discipline and education, needs to once again become a</p>
<p>priority in the &#8220;HOME OF THE BRAVE.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>I live in Cupertino California and send my white child to one of those &#8220;Asian dominated&#8221; schools. The reason we chose Cupertino is that we feel that the large number of high achieving Asians protect the schools  and neighborhood from those government programs such as school integration of &#8220;minorities&#8221; and &#8220;section 8&#8221;. The government isn&rsquo;t on our back to get rid of honors classes to &#8220;diversify&#8221; the class because we already have our minorities- hard working, high achieving Asians. </p>
