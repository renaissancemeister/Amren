<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This struggling small city on the outskirts of Mobile was warned for years that if it did nothing, its pension fund would run out of money by 2009. Right on schedule, its fund ran dry.</p>
<p>Then Prichard {snip} stopped sending monthly pension checks to its 150 retired workers, breaking a state law {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s rapid decline began in the 1970s. The growth of other suburbs, white flight and then middle-class flight all took their tolls, and the city&rsquo;s population shrank by 40 percent to about 27,000 today, from its peak of 45,000. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last week several dozen retirees  &mdash;  one using a wheelchair, some with canes  &mdash;  attended the weekly City Council meeting, asking for something before Christmas. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The budget did not move forward. {snip}</p>

		<p>I once had a chatroom buddy who lived in Mobile, AL for some time, and was well aware of Prichard.  He called Prichard by a different name   &mdash;   Take out the first syllable in &#8220;Prichard&#8221; and insert the first syllable of a certain racial pejorative.</p>
<p>He seems to think that &#8220;sagging&#8221; (as in pants to expose boxer short) as a clothing style (as opposed to a prison way of life) was actually born in Prichard.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s how to take care of the good retired folk from Pritchard:</p>
<p>Have the Pritchard City Council ask Obama for a municipal bailout! If they send along a group picture with the request for money this should be a slam dunk! The way the stimulus money was &#8220;managed&#8221; the people of Pritchard might even turn a profit.</p>

		<p>Read this story and then ask yourself if our government lies when is says we need to increase Diversity in order to improve the economy.</p>
<p>Does diversity improve the economy or does diversity destroy the economy?  Look at any place on the planet that has a high percentage of Blacks or Hispanics   &mdash;   does it enjoy a high standard of living or abject poverty, crime, misery, and social decay?  Now find a 99% White city   &mdash;   notice the difference?  </p>

		<p>Pension shortfalls are occurring in cities all across the country.  It will continue to get worse, as we get further into 2011, with states declaring also that they cannot meet pension obligations.  Police departments are being cut back en masse as well.</p>
<p>This situation was warned about several years ago, but has been ignored until the crash of &#8216;08.  In &#8216;07 Peter Schiff was warning that the country was on the brink of an economic plummet via a housing crisis, and was literally laughed at by other economists on a t.v. business network.</p>
<p>Gerald Celente forecast the crash of &#8216;08 in &#8216;07 and took out the domain name, &#8220;panic of &#8216;08,&#8221; and he was ignored by most in the MSM. He&rsquo;s also forecasting a fall into deep depression between 2010 and 2012, with a likely starting date of late 2010 to 2011.  From all indications that forecast appears to be on track as well.  Almost all his many forecasts have proven accurate with a deviation sometimes of a few months.</p>
<p>It is Celente who is saying the feds will have to step in and bail out the cities to keep them solvent and to also keep them legal, because all public pensions are protected by law; however, he maintains the feds are not going to have the funds to bail everybody out.  Pandemonium will be the result.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a tragic joke to see ex-cops and firefighters taking to the streets, rioting and tearing things up to protest pension payment stoppages?</p>

		<p>San Francisco is in a similar situation, with a lot of big differences.Most of the retirees arent black, we have a HUGE tax base, which gets ever larger because of the extreme leftist Board of Stupervisors,whose holy grail is expanding the size of City Government, increasing tax revnues, getting more and more City Employees, and giving them more and more generous pensions.One of our retired Po-leece cheifs,Earl Sanders,who helped to send to prision several totally innocent men for a few decades, draws a pension of  over 100 thousand.He has gotten a lot of hate e-mail lately.

		<p>Very Sad situation. Blcks can&rsquo;t administer anything. That group of retirees looked quite angry. I sure wouldn&rsquo;t want to be on that town council explaining to them why there&rsquo;s no money for their pensions anymore. It doesn&rsquo;t look like they&rsquo;d be too happy to hear any double talk.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m from Alabama and know Prichard quite well!  Decades ago it was a prosperous little city, but once blacks took over, it was straight downhill. The situation has nothing to do whatsoever with the economy. It has everything to do with thievery and utter incompetence. Just to give you an idea of how badly Prichard is run, all you have to do is look at the library. A statewide economic data publication gave information on all public libraries. Here in Tuscaloosa we have a very efficient library, it costs about $1.70 for each unit of circulation. In Hoover or Mountain Brook (two very nice affluent suburbs) the cost is about $3.00 per unit. In Prichard the cost is over $39.00 per unit!  The Prichard Library has a budget of about half a million dollars but only about 30 items circulate each day! THIS IS UTTERLY ASTOUNDING!</p>

		<p>When the other shoe drops it will probably be discovered that the black city council didn&rsquo;t just mismanage the fund, but raided it for personal percs and bling.  The root cause, of course, is that the whites fled the violence, and blacks don&rsquo;t pay taxes.<br>
However, a White conservative council would have seen it coming and done something about it.</p>

		<p>Prichard is a town that grew fast during world war two when many Alabama residents moved there to work in the ship yards.It began as a mostly white town, but as you can see from the pictures of the city council that has all changed.Also from the pictures you can see most of the retired workers are white. They will never get their money. </p>

		<p><i>This struggling small city on the outskirts of Mobile was warned for years that if it did nothing, its pension fund would run out of money by 2009.</i></p>
<p>This scenario will become increasingly common across the US as entire states from coast to coast run out of money and pension and entitlement obligations drive state governments over the edge (states cannot declare bankruptcy).</p>
<p>You see, unlike the Federal Government, state and local governments do not have access to printing presses to create dollars out of thin air.</p>
<p>As QD mentioned a while ago, the next big crash will be the municipal bond market as once-safe muni bonds become worthless junk, the debt cycle is cut off, a hostile Republican congress says no to states&rsquo; tin cups and years of state and local governments living beyond their means comes to an end.</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s old/new governor Gumby Brown stated the following with a straight face:</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been living in fantasy land. It is much worse than I thought. I&rsquo;m shocked.</p>
<p>Brown himself bears a lot of responsibility for the state of California&rsquo;s debt, because he made it possible for state employees to unionize and begin a spiral of insane salaries and pensions for state workers who routinely retire at 50 with pensions higher than their base pay.</p>
<p>Government allowance of ongoing illegal immigration has also been a huge factor in driving up California&rsquo;s insurmountable 27 billion dollar debt.</p>
<p>Richard Spencer explains:</p>
<p><i>The endgame will take one of two possible forms: 1) the federal government says no, and the downward pressures of cancelled pensions, higher taxes, and unemployment push the economy into a deflationary depression; or 2) the Feds say yes, fire up the printing press, meet every state and local obligation in nominal terms, and create, eventually, hyperinflation.</i></p>
<p><i>I would bet on the second.</i></p>
<p>Brace yourselves and prepare!  Pensions will collapse, entitlement benefits will dry up, the dollar will become worthless.</p>
<p>Financial Guru Lee Bellinger&rsquo;s <i>Independent Living</i> reports:</p>
<p><i>A new report by the Army War College&rsquo;s Strategic Studies Institute states flatly the U.S. military must prepare for &#8216;a violent, strategic dislocation inside the United States&rsquo; that could be provoked by &#8216;unforeseen economic collapse&rsquo; or &#8216;loss of functioning political and legal order.&rsquo;</i></p>

<p>I have no problem with those of you here who state <b>Bring it on!</b> but just make sure you and your loved ones are prepared.</p>

Minorities are a drain on whites. They always have been and they always will be. Add to that corruption and incompetence and you understand how things go down hill so quickly once they reach &#8216;critical mass&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Here in NY, the speeding train to fund minority entitlements is heading to the inevitable crash and burn. Even with the state flooded with minorities and the drive to bring in more, we&rsquo;re going to lose two congressional seats.</p>
<p>NY state is a perfect example of why bringing in more minorities isn&rsquo;t the solution. It&rsquo;s the problem.<br>

		<p>This is happening all across the country.  Interestingly, the more &#8220;diverse&#8221; the community, the more acute the problem.  </p>
<p>I know a pensioner from a small, predominantly white suburb.  He told me their pension kitty has plenty of cash.  The problem is all the big cities and towns are broke.  Some liberals have proposed that all pension funds be combined into one state-run fund!                  </p>

		<p> I think there&rsquo;s something else going on here that the media don&rsquo;t want to mention, but one glance at those photos will tell you.</p>
<p> The comment has been made that in Black-managed cities, Black councils quietly look at expenditure and decide &#8220;Who benefits - Black or White?&#8221;<br>
 In Black-managed cities, majority-White schools are being shut down while new schools are built in Black areas. Lavish sports stadiums and basketball courts are built while Police forces are cut. Basic maintenance and roads suffer while they raise their Salaries and blame everyone and everything else for their problems.<br>
 Here, they&rsquo;re taking it to the next step. They&rsquo;re cutting off majority-white recipients entire. You can bet this all-Black council will NEVER, EVER cut off Section 8, welfare.<br>

		<p>isnt it pretty obvious to the retirees when they talk to the all black council ? I assume it is. They should have seen the demographics changing and gotten out when the getting was good. </p>
<p>Any black majority city will be destitute. Because all black and hispanic populations are net drains on the economy. Look at california in general. As a white state it was the most successful in the nation. as a mestizo state, its bankrupt. it doesnt take a genius to figure it out. Whats terrible is section 8 housing that lets blacks move into and destroy even the white parts of town. this really must be stopped. its especially evil since the cost goes up with the cost of housing. All blacks should be on fixed price welfare and as america hyperinflates their benifits will naturally decline to nothing. right now tied into the ocst of housing they are living better than many hard working whites which is outrageous</p>

		<p>I live near a black city that was once white, where their council has cut the size of the cops and fire in half while landing on the top 10 most violent list.<br>
They have been raiding the budget for stuff like cash grants to black pastors, limos and cell phones for themselves, meetings in Sun City, South Africa. They also have been closing library branches but &#8216;reopening&rsquo; them in black churches while paying rental fees to the pastors.<br>
The feds caught them stealing from the housing funds, including stealing two million dollars to purchase a closed race track in their own names.<br>
They held a rally accusing the feds of racism and the congressman made the criminal charges go away.<br>
Blacks running a government doesn&rsquo;t work in Africa, why do we think it will somehow work here?</p>

<i>According to the articles, it appears that the pension funds have long been drained, at least partly through corruption. Due to its depressed economy the city is now finding it difficult to make ends meet.</i></p>
<p><i>It is worth noting that the pension obligations do not appear to quite the crushing burdens implied in these articles. The NYT reports that the average pension is $12,000 a year. This means that if the full payment were made out of current tax revenue it would imply a tax of approximately $18 per capita on the town&rsquo;s 27,000 residents. This is less than 0.14 of the city&rsquo;s per capita income.</i><br>

<p>No where is hispanic influence or black influence improving the overall quality of life.  Not even the nfl or other sports.  The formerly minority influence has pretty much dumbed down sportsmanship and conduct.</p>
<p>Economically speaking no improvement anywhere&hellip;they are consumers not builders of quality lifestyles and environments.</p>

		<p>They don&rsquo;t get it. They don&rsquo;t want to get it. These blacks and the Illegal Invaders infesting our country make the false assumption that it is the country (the land itself) that makes America great, sorry to burst your bubbles but as whites leave disaster moves in to take their place. If you were to put a few thousand whites on an island within a very short time they would be prospering. Now look at Detroit, Oakland, Africa, Mexico, there are little to no whites there, What do you find in places without white dominance&hellip; Poverty, Hunger, Shortages, Crime, are you starting to see the relationship here between white rule and the rule of any other group or race?</p>

Causing complete demographic shifts is the fate that the ruling class in corporate Washington have in store for America.<br>
Obama&rsquo;s vision of the future, like his corporate masters, has little to do with creating a viable future for all, and everything to do with taking away white American&rsquo;s futures. <br>
As you can clearly see in the second picture below, Prichard&rsquo;s city council is a puppet gov. far removed from  what a true conservative moderate local city council should be.<br>
A black ruled city whose politicians take their seats at each meeting with a smug smile realizing how the liberals built a fence around a small town and took away a peoples future.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, I see the opposite to what -should- happen being the most likely outcome.  Poor white elderly folk will be forced into &#8216;project&rsquo; like tenement lifestyles, treated like dirt by the cheap, resentful, labor which can be contrcted in with little or no elderly-care skills and basically put on starvation rations (including minimal meds) until they die off.</p>
<p>The loss of these folks will then of course allow a more liberal stance by both Republicans and Democrats with regards to handouts to the cheap labor classes.  Classes which will consume and destroy the environment and economic strength until they too are &#8216;dead at 50&rsquo; from poor health or deliberate sabotage of their lifestyle entitlements for the next bunch.</p>
<p>In this, Mexico and Africa are indeed good representations of what is coming.  10% rule 90% with whispered promises and an iron fist.</p>
<p>A generation of middleclass whites, who congeal economic wealth into few debt holdings (house, car, insurance, college, retirement) just don&rsquo;t keep enough currency value in motion to sustain the &#8216;economic growth&rsquo; which is ultimately killing our planet as much as ourselves.  We have to go.</p>
<p>Or the economic system which made the wealthy so heartless, has to.</p>
<p>But in the short term, there are options here folks.  We can stand up and take care of our own.  Create the kinds of group investment funds that not only pay for retirements but also make wealth for the entire  system of a retirement institution.  </p>
<p>Social Security would have worked, if it had been invested properly instead of being constantly hand-in-tilled by the Fed.  It could still work if heavy investment in a retirement community added up to a tax-free cash shelter and &#8216;reserved slot&rsquo; waiting list option for all of us.  Or alternately, take in elderly on a private basis and get tax credits for doing so via a refinished basement or whatever.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are so many of us in America and so much of the white base is over 50 that, unless we make some kind of group investment in caring for what amounts to our vote base, individual churches and charities will be rapidly swamped and all sense of social altruism lost.</p>
<p>Would you be willing to take in a large elderly population to your state or community, given current FHA new-construction standards for the elderly, and literally create a community for them based on a rapidly evaporating dollar value and drained pension funds?</p>
<p>If not, don&rsquo;t complain when those smug blacks smile their false commiseration at those idiot whites.  Because their insincerity is no less than yours.</p>

		<p>To Smart South Asian - HERE (in the US or Europe) you are productive and non-violent.<br>
And yes, individually on average Asian IQ&rsquo;s ARE higher than Whites.  But back home in South Asia and East Asia?  Not so productive, not so advanced, not so non-violent.  Back home in Asia the ruling class and corporate icons live like princes, while the vast majority live in abject poverty. Corruption and state sponsored or Tong/Yakuza type violence is rampant.   Kinda like in the black and brown world of Latin America and Africa, eh?<br>
To put a fine point on it, most folks here when talking of &#8220;minorities&#8221; are speaking predominantly of blacks and browns.  Not Asians.  So chill.  Nobody is attacking you or Asians - exempting Mhongs of course, who are another alien culture rifle with corruption, paganism, and gang mentality who DO come from Asia.  </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s a load, 24. Whites basically invented the modern world. I&rsquo;ll give the devil his due and admit that some South Asians and some East Asians are smart and are very good with the technology and SOME (but by no means all of the philosophical) concepts and ideas that WHITES INVENTED and propagated to create a successful civilization. But the creative power of Asians lacks far behind the white one if history, science, philosophy, and culture are any metric at all. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see people scrambling to go live in India or even in China the way people make mad dashes for the countries whites built and created. The &#8220;smart&#8221; Asians (especially South Asians) that you&rsquo;re alluding to represent the one or two percent cream of the crop that were smart enough to pool together the means to escape a tar pit of a country like an India or a Pakistan. Each of those countries are filled with low IQ people who contribute to an overall backward culture. The Indian technician we all know down the street (who might I add feels entitled to be here) is not the typical Indian. He is far from the mean average. So you can come off your silly high horse now about your race compared to mine or at least be consistent and get the hell out of Europe or America. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in East Asia. Thinking outside the box there is almost unheard of and that&rsquo;s why without the West, their world will stagnate. Everyone talks about how &#8220;techy&#8221; the Chinese and Japanese are. Well, who invented most of that technology that they use to fuel their economy? Indians? Nope. Pakistanis? Nope. Chinese? Nope. Yes, those hated &#8220;whites&#8221; did. So their intelligence is geared toward emulation, not innovation. Plenty of people have already figured out that Eastern progress runs on Western innovation.</p>

		<p>I live near Prichard, and I can tell everyone here that it&rsquo;s a wasteland full of abandoned, looted and collapsing buildings. Armed gangs are everywhere, and it&rsquo;s my area&rsquo;s no go zone. Drug dealing goes on openly day or night, and even in the daytime it&rsquo;s very dangerous to be there if you&rsquo;re white. Of course it&rsquo;s full of blacks. It&rsquo;s been run into the ground by blacks, who want to retain control at any cost, even at the expense of other blacks. To make matters worse, Mobile, New Orleans, Selma, Birmingham, Montgomery, Atlanta and many other cities in the southeastern U.S. are either controlled by blacks, are nearly all black, or both. All or part of these cities are very dangerous for whites, and because of that many whites carry weapons at all times. Brutal home invasions have occurred in my city that have been committed by blacks. If a city is controlled by blacks, it&rsquo;s devolution into a third world slum and war zone is assured. Prichard was at one time a nice, safe area to live, but that was until the blacks took over and the whites wisely fled. The same thing is happening to my city, and whites are moving to the Eastern Shore of Mobile bay or out into the county to the west and north. </p>

		<p>The situation is worrying indeed. </p>
<p>I have been sitting in a coffee shop in the French Quarter in New Orleans for many hours over this holiday season. </p>
<p>I have been SHOCKED to notice that over 80% of the toddlers that are brought here by their parents are mixed race, mostly Asian female/white male, but also a lot of White female/black male pairings. </p>
<p>At first I thought there must be a mixed-race marriage convention going on or something, it was truly shocking. </p>
<p>But the pattern persisted: I would see as stroller, while waiting in line I would get a glimpse of the toddler inside, and time after time after time, it would be a little brown baby. </p>
<p>How is this possible? This reeks of a conspiracy of the highest level. </p>
<p>I am not exaggerating the 80% figure either. On some days it has been even higher. </p>

<p>NONSENSE!  I remember well when the first Vietnamese arrived in California after 1975.  Vietnamese gangs were the start of the new rise of gangs in LA that ended up creating black and Hispanic gangs.  The IQ difference is only a couple points, not so great.  And as others pointed out, that only becomes so when Asians arrive and plant themselves here. It is their children, not them.  I have seen many fresh of the boat young Asians who can barely pass their classes at the community college where I live.  Interesting is that Russian and Ukrainians do so well in comparison, and are white.</p>
<p><br>
Asia, whether it is India, China, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, or wherever, has long been a very violent region.  The simple fact is that character languages improve the memory, so literate Asians do well.  But I haven&rsquo;t seen that improve standards of living for people living in Asia.  They all copy, steal, from the West.  China has only grown because it breaks international trade laws by fixing its currency.  Chinese people seem to act like idiots with new money, not the sage, responsible people they so often represent themselves to be.  They still believe that eating horns or fins from animals they cause to be slaughtered to extinction will make them more virile.  That&rsquo;s not intelligence at work.  I could go on, but this myth of the superior Asian is just that, a myth.  Still, Asians have more to offer because they have places in them where decency can be established.  That is due to being a very old people, culturally.</p>

		<p>To the folks who believe  &#8220;If you were to put a few thousand whites on an island within a very short time they would be prospering&#8221; you might want to take a look at your history.  When whites are the dominant cultural entity, they typically attempt to murder each other.  Reference Ireland 1800&rsquo;s, Europe 1912 or 1939, or U.S. 1929 when whites,  aka &#8220;Oakies&#8221; were murdered for daring to enter other states looking for work.  Not exactly the prosperous picture your trying to paint.</p>

		<p>I look at those poor white elderly folks who have been dispossessed of their pensions. This is a smaller version of how elderly whites live in Rhodesia and South Africa. They worked hard their entire lives under a stable white system, only to lose their deserved pensions when the blacks take over. It looks like a BBC news clip of &#8220;Poor Whites Still living in Zimbabwe&#8221;. They loose everything, and are often victims of violent racial attacks. Black communities in various parts of the US mirror Zimbabwe and South Africa. With white rule, there is prosperity, jobs, and security for everyone. With black rule, there is death for everyone. </p>

<p>Amongst themselves, whites will find reasons to differ and indeed in the last 100 years they&rsquo;ve killed one another with great diligence (as Mr Taylor might say). There haven&rsquo;t been any world wars in over 50 years, so I&rsquo;d like to say whites have put that history behind them, but recent troubles in the Balkans  show that whites can still be a quarrelsome bunch.</p>
<p>But whether or not whites fight amongst themselves wasn&rsquo;t the issue, was it? No, the question was whether when left to their own devices whites can take nothing and then create something out of it, i.e. a prosperous white society.</p>
<p>Well, the ultimate proof of this claim is Europe itself (and the US and Australia too), isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Left on their own, white people in Europe et al have created the most advanced technologically and culturally accomplished societies with the highest standards of living and best quality of life ever seen in human history. Is there any doubt of this?</p>
<p>Now tell us why white people couldn&rsquo;t be uprooted and planted somewhere else and not be able to do it all over again?</p>

		<p>#27, every dollar that is spent on old whites is one dollar that cannot be spent on white children. In the brave new world the old maxim that people that do not work should not eat will hold more true than ever, not just for blacks but also for whites. These old whites had their chance to influence events 30-40-50 years ago but they didnt and now they have to pay. I dont see why younger whites should cover for them. </p>

		<p>Where minorities congregate, Blacks and Hispanics, and other</p>
<p>various ethnic groups, diversity is a word that appears well in</p>
<p>its definition: a diverse range, a variety.  Normally,</p>
<p>accompanying this definition, are a lower class of people</p>
<p>escaping their origins, only to regroup into non-assimilating</p>
<p>entities that retain the the same traditions from which they</p>
<p>escaped from.  The Puritans, during the 17th century, escaped</p>
<p>from religious persecution in England and brought with them,</p>
<p>the same convictions from which they were escaping from.</p>
<p>Today, in the modern world, diversity appears to mean a safe</p>
<p>haven for groups that seldom contribute to decreasing their</p>
<p>internal domestic problems and rely on the city or the</p>
<p>Federal Government to come to their rescue.  It is also quite</p>
<p>noticeable, that wherever Black or Hispanics congregate, these</p>
<p>communities begin to become run-down because the educational</p>
<p>level is normally well below that of major-well-run white cities.</p>
<p>Blacks in Africa have fought for many years to obtain their</p>
<p>independence, but when One observes their progress, it can be</p>
<p>equated to that of a tribal mentality with no idea of how to</p>
<p>form a viable government for their people, and this is sad.</p>
<p>Education is the key factor, which is lacking amongst the</p>
<p>minority communities both in the United States, Africa and</p>
<p>other countries as well.  Until education plays a major role</p>
<p>in the world, DIVERSITY will be a listed as an equality to</p>
<p>low standards.</p>

		<p>Well, I wish I could have been involved in this discussion earlier.  I have been away from the website for a while.</p>
<p>First of all, I like all the comments above in regards to how &#8220;this is happening all over the country&#8221;.  </p>
<p>As a Southerner who&rsquo;s people have been trashed for decades now, and lectured about our awful racism by Northerners who have never had to live around a minority their whole life, I am glad to see that a lot of you are now experiencing what we have experienced all along.</p>
<p>No, of course it isn&rsquo;t a good thing, but I am looking at the big picture.  For decades you have lectured my people on tolerance, and you have enforced hateful institutions upon us such as Reconstruction and Integration.  Thanks to you, my people now have the worst schools in the entire country, but that isn&rsquo;t enough for most liberal Northern whites. Most of you STILL crack redneck jokes as if it is us Southern whites who are the low IQ-ed and violent people in the South.</p>
<p>Maybe now for once, since you are receiving a taste of your own medicine, you will for once stop enforcing such hateful policies on my own people.  Maybe now, for once, white people from ALL regions of the country will finally become racially conscious.</p>
<p>Second, to the arrogant Indian who posted&hellip;&hellip;.as others have noted, it is only the cream of the crop of your people who come here. 90% of your people back home can hardly compete with whites and as a result, India and China are hardly places to brag about.  So far, I am really only impressed with Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong, and even those places thrive on copying white technology.  Asians who live elsewhere have no business bragging.</p>
