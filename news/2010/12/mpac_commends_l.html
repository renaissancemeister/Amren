<h1>MPAC Commends LA City Council for Unanimous Passage of Resolution on Religious Pluralism, Islamophobia</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marium Mohiuddin, Muslim Public Affairs Council, Dec. 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Muslim Public Affairs Council congratulates the City of Los Angeles for standing up against the nationwide spread of Islamophobia by unanimously passing a resolution today that upholds the American principles of religious freedom and pluralism. City Councilman Tony Cardenas (6th District) sponsored and presented the resolution today at Los Angeles City Council meeting. </p>
<p>&#8220;Pluralism is an American bedrock value that speaks to one of our greatest strengths,&#8221; said Aziza Hasan, Southern California Government Relations Director, who attended the City Council hearing. &#8220;L.A. is proudly one of the most diverse cities in the world. This resolution will speak to that strength and serve as a model for the nation and world to follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The resolution recognizes Islamophobia as being a cause of the opposition to lawful construction and expansion of Islamic centers across the United States, including Tennessee, Wisconsin, Illinois, Connecticut and California. In addition, the resolution expresses deep concern about Islamophobia as evidenced by more than two dozen mosques across the United States who have been targets of vandalism, arson and other hate filled acts.</p>
<p>The adoption of this resolution by the Los Angeles City Council, in agreement with Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, will ensure that the city of Los Angeles will include in its 2010-2011 State and Federal Legislative Program plans to support and sponsor legislation that will oppose Islamophobia and condemn hateful violent acts against Muslim Americans.</p>
<p>Faith-based and community organizations who attended the hearing in support of the resolution included MPAC, the City of Los Angeles Human Relations Commission, Progressive Jewish Alliance, NewGround alumni, Progressive Christians Uniting, All Saints Episcopal Church Pasadena and California Faith for Equality.</p>
<p>&#8220;This resolution is about reminding ourselves to be responsible for ourselves and ask what do I stand for? Am I willing to correct myself? Am I willing to treat people equally?&#8221; Councilman Cardenas said during the City Council hearing.</p>
<p>Los Angeles is one of the most ethnically rich and diverse cities in the United States, with 600 religious sects and 224 various languages that are spoken.</p>
<p>Founded in 1988, MPAC is an American institution which informs and shapes public opinion and policy by serving as a trusted resource to decision makers in government, media and policy institutions. MPAC is also committed to developing leaders with the purpose of enhancing the political and civic participation of Muslim Americans.</p>

		<p>Communism and Islam are very similar.  Both are all-consuming, completely controlling social and economic systems that stifle creativity, science, independent thought, liberty and freedom.  Both systems create poverty and misery, and suck the joy out of life. <br>
 <br>
50 years ago we did everything we could to stop communism, including profiling and discrimination.  Politicians, preachers, teachers, professors, all spoke out about the dangers of bringing communism to America.  We fought tooth and nail to thwart communism.  We refused to hire communists.  We barred them from immigrating.  Speaking about the dangers of communism made you a concerned and patriotic citizen.  Islam is actually more dangerous than communism.  Yet, today, if you speak out about the dangerous of Islam, you are considered an evil, ignorant racist.  In some European countries, one can go to jail for &#8220;Hate Speech&#8221; if one points out the problems with Islam.  </p>

		<p>Both communism and Islam are adhered to with a mindless religious fervor by their brainwashed converts. Both are bad for America and neither should be allowed here. </p>
<p>Millions (maybe hundreds of millions) have been killed because of these 2 ridiculous, unnatural, cultish philosophies.</p>

		<p>1) If I remember correctly, Communism was once compared to a &#8220;godless islam&#8221; when it was founded.  However,  all of those things you mentioned are now being done to us &#8216;racists&rsquo;. It would have been better to simple explain how communism will always result in a giant prison than try to throw the communists in jail.</p>

<p>More like 50 years ago we fought tooth and nail to thwart McCarthy. Sure, the American military was large and ready but did more than 50 people &#8216;lose their jobs&rsquo; during all of the communist scare? In 2010 more people that that lose their jobs in one day in efforts to thwart the legacy of McCarthy - oops, in an effort to &#8216;fight intolerance&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Islamophobia.  This identifies a person or persons that have an &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; or unwarranted fear of Islam.</p>
<p>Anyone who is not a Muslin should have a reasonable fear of Islam as they will be viewed as an &#8220;Infidel&#8221; or nonbeliever. And the Koran clearly states that &#8220;Infidels&#8221; should be converted to Islam or&hellip;. put to the sword.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;Islam&#8221; means: &#8220;to submit&#8221;. If you do not submit to Islam you will be put to the sword. Now most Muslims cannot bring themselves to commit murder, however, there are many who can.  Therefore you should fear Muslims (potential murderers) until they are proven non-violent and not willing to &#8220;convert&#8221; you.</p>
<p>Islamophobia has become a new magic word in the liberal dictionary along with &#8220;racist&#8221;, &#8220;hater&#8221;, &#8220;homophobic&#8221; and &#8220;intolerant&#8221;. </p>
<p>The fact is, the enemy of my enemy is my friend and the enemy in this case continues to be the White, Christian, heterosexual male in America. Therefore those who are not Christian, or not white, or not heterosexual, or not male, will join together to defeat those who are. Mexicans are not white and Muslims are not Christian therefore they have something in common, a common enemy. Add into this mix the delusional, white liberals in L.A. and you have a strong force bent on destroying American society. </p>
<p>Los Angeles is a strong liberal epicenter which is indicitive of what is wrong with this country.</p>
<p>Americans do not share the same values as Muslims therefore they do not want to see America become Islamified like Europe.  To want to maintain your culture and values is not a &#8220;phobia&#8221; it is a rational thought of self-preservation.  It is pefectly normal. But in the world of LALA Liberal L.A. it is viewed as a phobia. So be it. Decide for yourselves. </p>

<p>I read statements like that and feel as if they&rsquo;re taken out of a page from Orwell&rsquo;s 1984. How can anyone be so blind. I would challenge the L.A. city council to compare the Los Angeles of 1965, or 70, (or even later) with today. I&rsquo;d ask them to give me one example where Los Angeles was better by any standard today- economic, social, or cultural  &mdash;   as opposed to when the city was 90% white.  The fascists are winning and I feel as if we&rsquo;re doomed. </p>

		<p>Municipal politicians increasingly want to accumulate political capital by pandering to immigrants. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s grandstanding and it works for them, with almost no perceptible downside.  </p>

<p>Communism and Islam, indeed are very similar. The major exception is that Islam uses religion as a mask for its true intentions, which is worldwide obedience to a Muslim &#8220;deity&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the past, I could never understand why Muslim states around the world allied themselves with the old Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact satellite states of Eastern Europe. After all, they preached atheism, while Muslims were devout believers in &#8220;Allah&#8221;. At first, I thought it was due to taking sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
<p>As you say, Islam is even more controlling than communism was. It damns democracy, condemns equal rights for women and represses free speech, thought and activities of individuals. Paradoxically, Muslims set up shop in democratic nations with the ultimate goal of bringing them to heel under the Islamic scimitar.</p>
<p>This is what must be fought, but which the Western democracies cannot understand.</p>

		<p>I realize O&rsquo;Reilly is an &#8220;expert&#8221; on everything, but he sure was off base the other night when he had two guests warn him of the evils of Islam. He told them they were wrong - but HE was wrong. Islam IS a threat to everywhere they occupy. If O&rsquo;Reilly ever gave anyone the chance to complete a sentence, he might learn something. Sorry, Bill, this time, you&rsquo;re the pinhead!</p>
