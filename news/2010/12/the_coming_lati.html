<h1>The Coming Latino Revolt</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bryan Curtis, Daily Beast, December 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s zero hour for the DREAM Act, a bit of immigration legislation that has taken on a hulking importance among Hispanic leaders. For two years, Barack Obama failed  &mdash;  or, if you prefer, refused  &mdash;  to nudge along a major immigration bill. The last-ditch hope is that departing Democrats, and a few Republicans, somehow band together in the lame-duck session and pass a law allowing illegal immigrants who came to the United States as minors to gain citizenship. Harry Reid promised to bring up the bill for a Senate cloture vote this week. Republicans vowed to scuttle it, just as they did in September</p>
<p>But as Chicago congressman Luis Gutiérrez prepares for a rally at a church in Brooklyn a few weeks before the vote, the DREAM Act seems like the end of his interest in congressional gamesmanship rather than the start. Gutiérrez is one of several Hispanic leaders who have found themselves politically estranged from the president. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} No, when the lame duck ends, Gutiérrez and his movement allies will ask for a divorce  &mdash;  from the Democratic Party, from the entire lawmaking process. To hear Gutiérrez tell it, Hispanic leaders are about to stage a full-tilt campaign of direct action, like the African-American civil-rights movement of the 1960s. There will be protests, marches, sit-ins  &mdash;  what César Chávez might have called going rogue. The movement will operate autonomously, no longer beholden to wavering Democrats, filibustering Republicans, and  &mdash;  perhaps most tantalizingly  &mdash;  no longer beholden to Barack Obama.</p>

		<p>I hope they do exactly what they are threatening to do.  Firstly, blacks were brought here in chains, or were born on American soil.  They didn&rsquo;t immigrate here, and they didn&rsquo;t ask to come here.  Trying to tie their arrogant, illegal presence to the black experience is SURE to anger blacks, especially when the illegals are taking many of the jobs blacks need.  Secondly, I can think of NOTHING that would anger and unite White Americans more than this plan on the part of the angry illegal invaders.  PLEASE carry through your plan!  When these arrogant interlopers tried one mass march carrying their Mexican flags there was such a backlash that amnesty died a twitching death, and America saw the face of the enemy under THEIR flag.  Lastly, people who sneak across our border, illegally, and then demand &#8220;rights&#8221; and services that their OWN country won&rsquo;t provide, at OUR taxpayer&rsquo;s expense, deserve only one thing: deportation or imprisonment at hard labor.</p>
<p>Go ahead.  Show the ugly face of the illegal invaders.  And watch the storm of new laws come crashing down on your heads.  Better you should just GO HOME.<br>

		<p>I love Chicago&rsquo;s congressman Gutierrez. He&rsquo;s against ANY restrictions on immigrants. Everybody anywhere can come here, get free education, a job, and free healthcare, because they are here. Especially if they are from Latin America.</p>
<p>why, you say?</p>
<p>Because he loves the media. Sunday talk shows. Nightly news. Internet.  Each time he demands, and he always demands, total public subsidies for Spanish origin immigrants with or without documents, I am convinced 1,000 Caucasian and perhaps Asian viewers are enraged.  Luis, keep your mouth blabbing. Demand more. And MORE. You, amigo, will be responsible for the tidal wave that will clean the streets of the USA.</p>

		<p>the obvious question is, why don&rsquo;t they go back and fight for their own country instead of making all these illegal demands here?  Because, they know that the whites are generous = higher chance of free loading here than in their own country.  third world peoples have this ingrained attitude that whites are suppose to take care of them otherwise = racism.  they are learning from the blacks that the whites somehow owed them something for some delusional wrongs. </p>

		<p>The Hispanics have latched onto a tried and true method of bullying Whitey. Jesse Jackson used to say, &#8220;It&rsquo;s gonna be a long hot summer!&#8221;, and White folks would grab their ankles and encourage their government representatives to open the floodgates to let the free stuff flow so that those scary Blacks wouldn&rsquo;t get mad again.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to risk getting a bloody nose, White folks. Those playground bullies are going to keep coming back every day for your lunch money if you don&rsquo;t. </p>

		<p>This will make it clear, once and for all, to both blacks and whites, that mestizos are not poor people looking for a handout and certainly are not brothers as people of color, but rather, violent, evil enemies bent of taking what is not theirs, by force.</p>
<p>There is no &#8220;civil rights&#8221; angle to this.  It&rsquo;s not a political issue or a legal one.  It&rsquo;s a form of warfare where mestizos plan to hurt people in order to convince them to hand over goods and services.</p>
<p>How will we respond?</p>

		<p>I work around a lot of latinos.  I hope it won&rsquo;t get ugly just for the sake of work-place safety. (We whites are a minority there.)  I also think at any marches and protests they have planned, it could be a bonanza for ICE officers who could corral them into buses and drive them immediately to the border!</p>

		<p>It is interesting. Black and Brown America appears to be in a state of intriguingly unstable dismay. The election of the Mulatto-Messiah, to much fanfare, adoration and &#8220;hope,&#8221; has not turned out to be the magical freeby-ride and &#8220;coming-of-age&#8221; many non-whites obviously felt it should and would be! </p>
<p>How quickly the overall mood has changed from those halcyon moments of the Annointed One&rsquo;s inauguration. Non-whites and unhappy, yet they and their liberal White facilitators contiue to over-played their hand at every turn. And America is more racially polarized than in many a year! </p>
<p>Thus, as basically eveyone else has already said - &#8220;bring it on ye teeming brown minions&#8221;&hellip;the louder and angrier you get, the more White Americans awake!!<br>

<p>This is correct. These goons were told by the organizers of the marches NOT to fly the Mex flag but the goons did so anyhow. A thumb in the eye as they saw it. An arrogance that is very detrimental to their cause. But these are PROUD people, let us not forget that.</p>
<p>Hell, their very presence if an illegal is civil disobedience all the time. Might as well do it openly and notoriously and without restraint. Their very everyday life is civil disobedience already.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Coming Latino Revolt&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it looks like it&rsquo;s coming at a time when the police are getting laid off in many urban areas.  </p>
<p>N.J. has a pretty large mestizo population, so the big cities there are probably in for some chaos at a time when it can ill afford to handle it.</p>
<p>Here are just two in the news the last couple of days.</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/2frh4wz</p>
<p>&#8220;TRENTON   &mdash;   Camden received the state&rsquo;s permission Tuesday to lay off nearly half of its police force and about one-fourth of all city government employees.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2af34kt" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2af34kt</a></p>
<p>&#8220;A day after Mayor Cory A. Booker announced that the city was laying off roughly 13 percent of its police force, residents battered by decades of runaway crime and stampeding blight raised the specter of the bad old days.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are just two cities. The entire country is downsizing in sporadic areas from sea to sea.  It will get worse. </p>
<p>Looks like Tom Chittum, via his book, Civil War II, could well be right on. <br>

		<p>If the illegals gain citizenship, they will also gain affirmative action preferences, and thus gain admittance to a college, a scholarship, a job, a promotion, or a contract over a better qualified person born in America.  This is a good reason to oppose any amnesty or dream act.  Indeed, for American citizens, it will be a nightmare act.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  Hugh Murray</p>

		<p>Luis Gutierrez is a traitor. He has been quoted as saying, &#8220;My only loyalty is to the immigrant community.&#8221; He means to the criminal community. I don&rsquo;t know of anyone who deserves less to be in office than him&hellip; except maybe Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi. His constituents are the very people who are demanding that they be taken care of. And he complies. He is a disgrace to America and needs to be voted out, but as long as he fights for those who laugh at our laws they will continue voting for him. He is as anti-American as those who wave their foreign flags and demand that the US give them the benefits of citizens. If this weak government of ours would immediately stop all benefits we would see a huge exodus, and it wouldn&rsquo;t cost us a penny.</p>

		<p>Not that I agreed with the &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; movement from the 60s, but at least blacks then could make a case: they were here as citizens for centuries.  Hispanics, on the other hand, only started being more noticeable increasingly in the past few decades and most of them are here illegally.  Lots of blacks don&rsquo;t like them taking away their entitlements, and most whites are sick and tired of supporting non-whites in general.  They aren&rsquo;t going to take over the country without a fight.  I will guarantee the Hispanics that.</p>

		<p>Re: Bill R</p>
<p>You need to realize that&rsquo;s its not just Mexicans fighting for this bill, there are people from all walks of life rooting for it. The problem isn&rsquo;t some poor soul sneaking into the country. We can argue that white Europeans came to America for the same reasons all people end up in America for. The problem is the people we elect into office who ignore our cries to close the borders, and refuse to get us out of wars in which we have zero interest in, and so on.  Advice to all americans-vote the incumbents and foreign country adherents who lack loyalty to the United States of America out of office. You don&rsquo;t have to look beyond the democratic party to discover true illegals who are  disguised in sheep&rsquo;s clothing who have utter contempt for us all constitutional defenders</p>

		<p>The Hispanics do not have the stones for civil disobedience.  At the first sign of police or ICE they will run.  They get no respect and deserve none from Democrats because like Blacks they go mindlessly along and get nothing, but lip service in return for their millions of votes.
