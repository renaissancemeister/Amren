			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amina Khan, Los Angeles Times, December 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the world heats up and polar ice melts, different types of bears, whales and seals could meet and mate  &mdash;  but these unions may be far from happy, researchers said Wednesday. In fact, interspecies sex brought on by the melting Arctic ice could lead to the extinction of many endangered Arctic animals, the scientists said in an article published in the journal Nature.</p>
<p>At least 22 species are at risk of hybridizing in 34 different combinations, according to a team led by Brendan Kelly, an Alaska-based evolutionary biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The pairings include polar bears and grizzlies, narwhals and beluga whales, and various assortments of seals. Some of those species are listed as endangered or threatened.</p>
<p>Because hybrid offspring  &mdash;  or their offspring, in turn  &mdash;  are often infertile, maladapted or sickly, much of the genetic biodiversity of the Arctic could be lost, the scientists warned.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kelly and his coauthors reached their conclusions after reviewing the scientific literature, scouring museums for possible hybrid bones and pinpointing which populations are at risk of running into each other as the Arctic ice shrinks. That ice has separated many sea- and ice-dwelling animals for as long as 10,000 years, maintaining a barrier to animal movement, and thus interbreeding. Some scientists have predicted that the Arctic could become ice-free by the century&rsquo;s end as a consequence of climate change.</p>
<p>Although Arctic species rarely interbreed, many are capable of doing so. In 2006, a bear with a patchy white-and-brown coat was shot in the Canadian Arctic. Scientists suspected  &mdash;  and DNA-typing later confirmed  &mdash;  that the animal was a polar-grizzly hybrid, a creature known variously as a &#8220;pizzly&#8221; or &#8220;grolar bear.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the 1980s, an apparent beluga-narwhal hybrid skull (one that lacked the narwhal&rsquo;s single tusk) was picked up in Greenland.</p>
<p>And last year, what appeared to be a hybrid of two whales  &mdash;  a bowhead whale and a right whale  &mdash;  was spotted in the Bering Sea.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If endangered animals increasingly mate with other species, they could be hybridized out of existence, Kelly said. Consider North Pacific right whales. About 200 are known to exist  &mdash;  and only 30 in the area where Withrow spotted the bowhead-right whale hybrid in 2009.</p>
<p>Even though hybrids can often be healthier than either of their parents (a phenomenon termed &#8220;hybrid vigor&#8221; by scientists), this is often a temporary advantage, said coauthor Andrew Whiteley, a conservation geneticist at the University of Massachusetts. The offspring, should the hybrids be fertile, are generally more sickly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Negative effects may be more subtle too, said Fred Allendorf, a conservation geneticist at the University of Montana who was not involved in the study. Birth cycles may not match up with those scarce months when food is available. Animals may head in the wrong direction during migration periods. And it&rsquo;s not clear that hybrids would be hardy enough to handle certain environmental shocks or diseases.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s only three problems with this.</p>
<p>1.  The world is cooling, not warming.  It actually may be cooling at a dramatic rate.</p>
<p>2.  The arctic ice is expanding, not melting.  See #1.</p>
<p>3.  Species do not typically cross mate unless forced to by adaptation to human disruption of their environment (ie no other mates around), domestication and forced breeding etc.  The ability of somewhat similar species to create &#8220;mules&#8221; is interesting but atypical.  It is NOT a mechanism of extinction.</p>
<p>Put another way, has any species had documented extinction through this method?  That would be no.  That&rsquo;s because this is theoretical bordering on the delusional.  It has no basis in facts&hellip;..like most liberal pseudo-science.</p>

		<p>Gee, can someone tell me why these liberal environmentalist alarmists find it SO troubling that bears might interbreed and become extinct as unique breeds, but at the same time cheer on the extinction of the White race of humans through inter-racial breeding?  Pretty short sighted.  Have anybody other than Whites given a hoot about any animal, or contributed to the DWL environmental alarmist organizations?  When Whites are gone, to be some mulatto racial abomination with the darker hue being dominant in personality and intelligence, who saves the world then?  Bears might interbreed.  HORRIBLE.  SOUND THE ALARM.  Whites are going against nature and interbreeding with other races, not breeding at all, or engaging in unnatural sex which cannot bring forth the next generation.  HOORAY.  MORE OF IT.  AND IF YOU DISAGREE YOU ARE A NAZI.  And they don&rsquo;t even understand the irony of their position and accusation.</p>

		<p>Damn that global warming.</p>
<p>I was deeply dismayed by the dozen or so cases of hybridizing that I observed at a mall in Louisville over this past weekend. The male specimens that I studied appeared to be extremely poor examples of their racial group and I initially mistook their mates for either polar bears or Beluga whales. The offspring from these matings will likely lack the intelligence required to utilize their food stamp cards. </p>
<p>Al Gore tried to warn us this would happen, but we refused to listen.</p>

While I understand AR&rsquo;s reason for posting this (miscegenation of unique animal species) I have to say this is yet another propaganda piece by the warming alarmist.</p>
<p>These people are pulling every punch. Now they&rsquo;re concerned about maintaining unique animal diversity. Give me a break.</p>
<p>Global warming, climate change, global climate disruption, which ever phase they&rsquo;re using this week, is only an attempt to extort money from rich nations and give it to poorer nations with a great amount of skimming along the way.</p>
<p>The idea that you can produce the same amount of airborne carbon dioxide but charge nations for doing it doesn&rsquo;t address the problem and has SCAM written all over it.<br>

I know that in the early 40s at least the Canadian Arctic was more ice-free than it is now during summer. But the problem is age and thickness of winter ice, and both have been systematically decreasing over at least the last four decades. That´s one of the things we built mm-wave radar satellites for :). If you think the current cold spell means anything, you might want to think again (though there are some new data on sun activity that just &#8220;might&#8221; mean a reversal).</p>

<p>I thought Darwinism was suppose to take care of this. The sickly die off and the healthy live, mate and produce offspring.</p>
<p>This looks like a prime example of Orwellian doublethink &#8220;The power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one&rsquo;s mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.&#8221;</p>

		<p>While the &#8220;grolar&#8221; bears do not appear to be dysfunctional, interspecies breeding among deer in the Texas trans-Pecos region produces a mule deer-whitetail hybrid that doesn&rsquo;t live long.  The animal&rsquo;s gait is midway between a whitetail&rsquo;s run and the bounding spring of a mule deer, with the result that the (slower, less agile) hybrids can not escape predators like pumas.</p>
<p>Where grolar bears are concerned, an Inuit hunter shot a bear last April that he thought was a polar bear.  DNA testing confirmed that it was a second-generation hybrid with a grolar bear mother and a grizzly bear father.  These hybrids thus seem to do OK, since one obviously grew to sexual maturity in this case.  Canadian wildlike officials have proposed calling these &#8220;nanulak&#8221; bears, as &#8220;nanuk&#8221; and &#8220;aklak&#8221; are the Inuit words for grizzlies and polar bears, respectively.  Hybrids like these observed in zoos behave as polar bears do, stamping toys the way polar bears break ice and hurling them to the side the way the do when catching seals.  Grizzly bears given the same toys do not do this.</p>
<p>Infertility in hybrids is fairly common.  If the parent species have differing numbers of chromosomes, the hybrid can have an odd number of chromosomes.  For instance, a goat has 60 chromosomes and a sheep has 54.  The resulting &#8220;geep&#8221; from a mating has 57.  Horses have 62 chromosomes and donkeys have 62; mules and hinneys thus have 63.  These hybrids can&rsquo;t produce viable gametes because the odd chromosome disrupts meiosis in a sort of evolutionary censorship.</p>

<p>Apparently the gospel of Global Warming grants a dispensation from logical consistency.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you had any education in biological sciences, or health sciences, you would be able to easily see that genetic changes due to interbreeding might produce offspring that are initially strong but later fail to flourish.  This has been seen over and over again in various hybriding experiments since the 19th century.  </p>
<p>You are so anxious to attack the political aspect of the global warming phenomena that you end up preaching to your very limited choir, while repulsing anyone with a higher education.  Exactly the opposite of that continued, &#8220;We whites have inherently higher IQ&rsquo;s argument.</p>
<p>All that has to be done to confirm that the overall temperatures on earth are increasing is to measure increased sea levels and overall changes in not only the ice caps, but glaciers, both of which are shrinking at alarming rates.  Anyone who lives in a state with a glacier or two will know this, and it is world wide.  Shifts in ocean currents as a result of this melt can and do result in colder winters in some places, but that is a temporary trend.  The entire scenario of for example, Britain having colder winters was predicted a couple decades ago and occurs because the colder melt waters actually reduce the gulf flow to the seas that normally warm the British Isles.</p>
<p>The real takeaway from this article is not the knee-jerk anti-global warming political know-nothingness most posters are responding with, but a usable argument concerning race mixing.  Race mixing presents long term health problems because genetic outbreeding is as problematic as inbreeding, maybe worse. The  statements made about biodiversity are great examples of how science actually supports preservation of species, which on the human level, ought to apply and demonstrate clearly that universal race mixing is not going to result in a better world. </p>

<p>So you didn&rsquo;t get the memo that climate science is a boiling cauldron of horse pucky?  Still a disciple of the Goracle?  I guess you don&rsquo;t have to learn anything when you already know everything there is to know&hellip;</p>
<p>Most of the time I respect your insight, but personally what I find repulsive is your &#8220;those with a higher education&#8221; attitude.  We&rsquo;re sorry we haven&rsquo;t been all over Europe, we&rsquo;re sorry some of us are still hopelessly rooted in that whole passe Jesus thing, we&rsquo;re sorry that according to you we don&rsquo;t deserve the &#8220;vaunted IQ&#8221; label.   </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough as it is, but then when we have to listen to you proclaim nonsense like socialism is the answer for us whites and we all just need to shut up and listen to the learned &#8220;best and brightest&#8221; among us (including you presumably) because economic and climatologic issues are beyond our feeble grasp, I fail to see exactly what separates you from Obama other than you&rsquo;re one-half-more of a white man.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t accuse others of being ignorant if you&rsquo;re going to preach junk science and champion an economic system that requires a repressive authoritarian government to survive and has worked a grand total of zero times.  White men don&rsquo;t need a dole.  They need to rediscover their spines and stop listening to the &#8220;best and brightest.&#8221;  We may be uneducated rubes but we know damn well where we&rsquo;re headed when we feel the pavers of your good intentions under our feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hybrid vigor&#8221; is a term for <i>when</i> hybrids are more vigorous than pure-breds.  How this became &#8220;hybrid vigor is the extra vigor you get when you cross-breed,&#8221; as if hybrid vigor was a given, I&rsquo;ll leave to others (I&rsquo;d start with Alon Ziv &amp; co.).</p>
