<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New York Gov. David Paterson commuted the sentence Thursday of a black man imprisoned for the racially charged shooting death of a white teenager on Long Island, a decision in the final days of his administration that infuriated the lawyer who prosecuted the case.</p>
<p>Paterson said the five months John Harris White has served was enough time for the emotion-fueled 2006 shooting death of Daniel Cicciaro, 17. Paterson said everybody connected with the case had suffered enough, and White was released Thursday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A judge sentenced White to two to four years in prison, a fraction of the maximum, exactly four years ago Thursday. He finally went to prison in July this year after his appeals were rejected.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Spota [Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas J. Spota] said a court, upheld by an appellate court, agreed that a reasonable person wouldn&rsquo;t have believed deadly force was needed that hot summer night.</p>
<p>In a courtroom secured by 18 police officers because of the racial tensions, White testified that he was trying to protect his family when the white teenagers turned up at his house. He claimed his pistol fired accidentally when Cicciaro lunged for it.</p>
<p>The victim had a blood-alcohol reading above the legal limit for driving and was just 3 inches from the pistol when he was shot.</p>
<p>White had said his son, Aaron, woke him around 11 p.m. to say teens he had argued with at a party were headed to the Whites&rsquo; house in Miller Place, a predominantly white community on eastern Long Island.</p>
<p>The younger White had complied earlier with a request to leave the beer bash after he was suspected of posting online threats against a teenage girl at the party. The story of the threats turned out to be bogus, but when Cicciaro and others heard about what happened, they headed for Miller Place, making cell phone calls to Aaron White.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an inspiring example of an elected official using commutation powers for good,&#8221; said Benjamin Jealous, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The NAACP sought a full pardon.</p>
<p>The Rev. Al Sharpton said that he hoped the families would move toward healing and that the governor &#8220;showed great courage and fairness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sharpton had led a rally in Riverhead, the county seat, complaining that none of the teenagers who arrived at White&rsquo;s house was prosecuted. The district attorney&rsquo;s office said the White family refused to cooperate with a police investigation.</p>
<p>The spokesman said a canvass of the neighborhood found no evidence or witnesses to corroborate allegations made by White&rsquo;s attorneys.<br/>

						<p>
							<i>Corky Siemaszko, New York Daily News, December 23, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A black Long Island man convicted of killing a white teenager was home for the holidays Thursday after Gov. Paterson commuted his sentence.</p>
<p>John White, 56, was released after serving just five months in an upstate prison for killing 17-year-old Daniel Cicciaro Jr.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from Cicciaro&rsquo;s parents, who were not told in advance that White was being sprung.</p>
<p>During his bitter and racially charged trial, White claimed he was trying to protect his family from a &#8220;lynch mob&#8221; when he fatally shot Cicciaro Jr. on Aug. 9. 2006.</p>
<p>Paterson said he realized his decision  &mdash;  reached in the waning days of his administration  &mdash;  would tear open barely healed wounds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Paterson, who has a week left in office before giving way to newly elected Andrew Cuomo, is not the first governor to spring a convicted felon early.</p>
<p>&#8220;We salute Gov. Paterson&rsquo;s decision and hope that all families involved will move towards healing,&#8221; the Rev. Al Sharpton said. &#8220;There are no winners in this situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota ripped Paterson for callously disregarding the feelings of the victim&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>A drunken Cicciaro was killed at the foot of White&rsquo;s driveway after he went to the home with four friends late at night, bent on fighting Aaron White over a bogus rape threat, police said.</p>
<p>They yelled racial slurs and threatened to rape Aaron White&rsquo;s mother, according to cops.</p>
<p>White testified he grew up in Brooklyn hearing stories about how the Ku Klux Klan torched his grandfather&rsquo;s business in Alabama. He said wanted to scare the mob away and that his gun accidentally went off when Cicciaro lunged at him.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said that instead of calling the cops, White went out to confront the teens and shot Cicciaro in the face from three inches away.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t get it.  I would not normally defend blacks against whites, but  &mdash;  if the story is legit, the father was probably justified in pulling the gun to protect his family.  He screwed up, and probably accidentally shot some drunken punk.  This does not sound like typical black on white crime, it sounds like someone defending his home.  Then again, I don&rsquo;t really know any of the specifics, other than what I have read here, so I could be very wrong.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Prosecutors said that instead of calling the cops, White went out to confront the teens and shot Cicciaro in the face from three inches away.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is at least third degree murder and perhaps second degree. A very lenient sentence to begin with and then the guy is let go after five months. I must be getting old. He did not call the cops to begin with?</p>
<p>Anytime you confront a person with a firearm you are saying: &#8220;I intend to kill you!&#8221; Whether you mean it or not.</p>
<p>Heaven forbid if this had been a whitey shooting a black youth in a similar situation. That would have been at least first degree murder charges and spend twenty years minimum in max security, maybe the SHU.</p>
<p>This White [ironic, isn&rsquo;t it] will get sued big time in civil court now.</p>

I may be alone in this, but I don&rsquo;t believe governors or presidents or anyone should have the power to pardon people.</p>
<p>People are judged and found innocent or guilty by their peers. I always find it outrageous and arrogant the one person can bypass the justice system. These people were likely uninvolved in hearing the courtroom presented facts in the case. How can they determine guilt or innocence or simply disregard the evidence in each case?</p>
<p>If this process is going to continue, I believe it should be made public.</p>
<p>Elected leaders should be required to publicly announce all cases they are considering at least two weeks or more so that the victims involved have the opportunity to present their side of the case.</p>
<p>These last minute walking out the door decisions are an affront to our justice system.  </p>

		<p>Last year, an incident with many similarities took place in Rochester, New York. A black man, father of six, was staying overnight in a house owned by his white girlfriend in the suburb of Greece.  About 2:00 a.m., a couple of white teens were going into unlocked cars, probably looking to steal the contents.   The black man left the girlfriend&rsquo;s house with a loaded pistol, confronted the teens, who were unarmed, and were not on the girlfriend&rsquo;s property nor breaking into his or her car, and shot one of them twice, killing him.  He was acquitted of manslaughter. </p>

		<p>A drunken 17-year old and four of his pals came around, late at night, and threatened this man&rsquo;s family.  White or black, these don&rsquo;t sound like the nicest of people. There is doubtless more to this story, but based on what we are told, I won&rsquo;t get involved in defending these unsavory characters. I&rsquo;m keeping out of this.</p>

		<p>So a black kid comes onto a white girl, she rejects his advancements, he makes threats like a normal black. Funny how the article asserts that the threats were &#8220;bogus&#8221;</p>
<p>And somehow the black is the good guy?</p>

<p>To say that nobody should be allowed the pardon power is to think that the criminal justice system is perfect.  The prosecutors, defense lawyers, defendants, witnesses, judges and juries are all human, and therefore, it sometimes does get it wrong.  And even if it gets it right, it can get it right for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>However, I think there should be a differentiation between a pardon or commutation that allows someone to be released from incarceration, a pardon or commutation that wipes away someone&rsquo;s probation, and a commutation that wipes out the rap sheet of someone who is out of prison and complete with probation.  Furthermore, a pardon or commutation that means someone is released from prison should be further delineated between violent (i.e. murder) and non-violent (i.e. having an illegal bullet) crimes.  For these varying degrees, there should be something along the lines of consent of the legislative body if the commutation or pardon means a release from prison and/or probation.  And of course there should be ample time for public input.</p>
<p>I tend to think that it should be a little easier to be pardoned.  I know there are various programs out there for that, mainly for the benefit of people whose felonies were committed at a younger age, and who has done nothing wrong since then.  However, the states can&rsquo;t publicize these pardon programs, because of the whole &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; nonsense   &mdash;   Whites far more than blacks would tend to benefit, and you know the civil rights crowd will throw a fit.</p>
<p>And of course, any respect I had for David Paterson has now evaporated.</p>

		<p>If these newspaper stories are accurate, then this guy did not do anything wrong. Anyone should be allowed to shoot punks in the face if they are on (and &#8220;foot of the driveway&#8221; should count as on) their private property. That being said, and is often said here, reverse the races of the shooter, victim, and governor and then see how the Black &#8220;leaders&#8221; react. Once again, it is shown that they care about Blacks rather than about justice.</p>

<p>You may turn out to be right, but I think I disagree with you. Since our people DO mostly believe in fair play, it seems to me that to appeal to them, we must uphold fair play ourselves).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough about the circumstances in this particular case, but I do know that when I go to white nationalist websites or to any other websites, it drives me nuts trying to separate the truth from the drek. How much more pleasant it would be if everyone thought the truth alone was dreadful enough to support their positions adequately. I know&hellip;.dream on, sucker&hellip;!</p>

		<p> It seems like a justifiable shooting to me. If a bunch of black guys showed  up at my house yelling racial slurs and threatening my family there is a pretty good chance he would be shot.If he lunged at me he definitely would get shot. Of course I live in Texas and we don&rsquo;t convict people for defending their homes.</p>

<p>Very good point.  Also, I did read the article as carefully as I should have.  If this were a white on black shooting, then  &mdash;  as has been pointed out here  &mdash;  the resulting news coverage would have been slanted egregiously, as the coverage of this most likely has been.  I should know better by now than to take a news article at face value.</p>

		<p>The black teenager was thrown out of the party because they believed he had made rape threats against the girl on facebook (later they claimed his &#8220;friend&#8221; used the facebook account without permission and made the rape threats, no one denied the threats occured they just claimed someone else used the account).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy into the &#8220;self defense&#8221; line at ALL. The gun was THREE INCHES from the kids face! Who in their right mind would walk up and shove a gun right in the face of a person you thought was endangering your life? </p>
<p>Details of the story include the fact the teenagers were well know to the black kid, and had been calling him after he left the party at which point he said &#8220;yeah come on over&#8221;. They came over and yelled from the street, at which point the father and son, both armed, walked down to the street to yell back. The father threatened all of them with the gun then shoved it in the victims face, the victim slapped the gun away and the father did it again, this time firing at point blank range.</p>
<p>They knew the kids were coming over, the son told them too, they could have called the police but instead went down to threaten and confront them. The kid was shot because he was disrespectin&rsquo; a black man, that was obviously the main reason.</p>

		<p>Race and race-tension obviously here in everyone involved.  None of the major participants acted well.  As usual, the solution isn&rsquo;t to release the felon who the DA decided to prosecute, the solution is to put everybody involved in jail and keep them there for a while until they understand they don&rsquo;t live in their own little isolated bubble. Neither the whites nor blacks of this story at least deserve official pardon, compassion or much attention beyond vigorous prosecution.</p>
