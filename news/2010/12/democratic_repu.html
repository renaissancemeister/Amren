<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two Belgians traveled through the former Belgian Congo and posted their photos and observations on line. Here are some excerpts:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is that old generation that longs back to the colonial time. They acknowledge there were a lot of problems in that period and that they were discriminated by the white coloniser. But at least they had a functional country. They had roads and schools. They had jobs and could buy supplies. And above all, there was stability. Now there is nothing but uncertainty .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. waiting for the next war to start.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The first village we encountered seemed deserted at first, but as soon as we entered the village we saw people coming at us from all sides. They had machetes and sticks and were shouting. &#8216;Des Blancs. Argent!&rsquo;  &mdash;  &#8216;White people. Money!&rsquo; They were all over the place. This was not good! I floored it and sped out of the village. A rock hit the back of our car. What in gods name was that all about? Very few Congolese had made us feel welcome, but this was plain aggression! It scared the hell out of us. We passed another village, and once again a mob formed as soon as they heard us coming. Machetes flying round, racist slogans shouted. Once again we did not give them the chance to get near us and blasted out of the village. They tried following us. This was turning ugly, if we would get stuck here we would be in big trouble, these people did not want a chat!&#8221;<br>

		<p>My spouse just had a niece spend six months in South Africa. She was transformed. Not a good thing. She told how the cabbies and everyone else she came into contact with would &#8220;Scold&#8221; her on not knowing what the score was since she was White. She related this with all the zeal of the converted and seems determined to address the racism. She had also come home and verbalized her decision to soon visit every country in Africa. At that point her Dad smiled and shook his head like no way&hellip;<br>
 Another thing that made me laugh. Her grandfather had gone down there on a cruise. When I asked about conditions he made a telling if inadvertant remark. he said, &#8220;We had a lecture on the ship about the problems of residual racism they are overcoming&hellip; Actually there were six lectures!!&#8221; I had to walk outside as I could no longer stifle the guffaws.</p>

<p>How on Earth could such a country not be rich?  It must be a racist conspiracy of course! All Les Blancs have stolen all the Argent, that must be it. What other explanation could there possibly be?</p>

		<p>Long ago I read stories in Life Magazine about the Belgium Congo gaining its independent. People in the Congo were told that once they got independence, they would become white and would have big cars to drive. People came to town with baskets wanting independence to take back to their villages. There were even a picture of a billboards with smiling Congolese driving in big cars.  </p>
<p>I also remember reading that one of the first acts of the new government was to kill anybody that was educated. They deliberately killed the very people they needed the most. </p>

<p>A number of years ago now, this Professor Ferguson suggested that a return to colonialism in some parts of the world would be a good thing. Well, you can imagine the hysteria that suggestion was met by. And the man had the Congo in mind. A degenerate place reverting to the ancient ways. The &#8220;natural order&#8221; of things being restored. The people acting according to their true and basic nature, and to the detriment of all. </p>

<p>&#8220;Eventually they offered to help us if we pay them. I tell them that I do not have money. They did not move an inch.</p>
<p>It takes the best part of an hour to get us out. To their surprise we stop again and I get out and walk up to them. Very calmly I explain that we did not like it when they laughed at us. I asked them how they would react if they hurt themselves and we would laugh at them. The acknowledged that they would get mad at us.<br>
I asked them if they would want us to help them if they had a problem. The acknowledged this. I said what they would think if we asked for money before we would help them. <b>They called us racists and immediately demanded money from us.</b>&#8221;</p>

		<p>Those two tourists are either just plain nuts, or have more balls between the two of them than an entire village. Why they didn&rsquo;t get mugged and ripped off for everything they had is a complete mystery. What are the locals afraid of? That some (crooked)cop is gonna arrest them if they helped themselves to the goodies.</p>
<p>Maybe for a nice followup adventure they can try to walk through a typical American ghetto at night. Harlem, East St. Louis, New Orleans, south side of Chicago, anyone??</p>

		<p>If you have a few hours to spare, this was a very good read. Very educational. But not in the way I think this Belgian couple intended. The racism shown them was very overt. The Congolese people are a wretched lot. This couple may have been prepared for adventure, but I don&rsquo;t think they had a clue as to what they were getting themselves into. And I may be wrong, but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re aware that they are lucky to have gotten out of there alive. And after having read this, it just confirmed what I knew already. The Congolese people have only themselves to blame for their wretchedness, but still try to blame white people.</p>

They only pretend to. White liberals behave as though they know what the truth is. They avoid black neighborhoods, especially after dark. They do not send their children to predominately black public schools. </p>

		<p>This is a good read, and the authors comments and those of the readers are also informative.<br>
almost all of the observations the authors made are no news to AmRen posters:</p>
<p>*The police and authorities are incredibly corrupt, all police and governmental officials are constantly working for a bribe. How can a working economy be built with such corruption?</p>
<p>*The citizens themselves aere also constantly looking for handouts. No assistance is offered unless money is promised.</p>
<p>*The locals have the same cruelness we are familar with. When their vehicle was stuck, villagers laughed at them as the struggled to free it.</p>
<p>*It is understood by all that life was better under colonial rule. Virtually all services have deteriorated severely since its&rsquo; end.</p>
<p>*African &#8220;mechanics&#8221; are butchers, their primary tools being hammers and screwdrivers.</p>
<p>*Wildlife is being hunted to extinction; modern firearms have allowed this.</p>
<p>*The Chinese are taking over. The only developement is from the Chinese who essentially are coming in with their own people and utilizing the natural resources. No locals are usually hired.</p>
<p>Amazingly,(or maybe not) the others readers post comments wondering why Africa is such a mess!</p>

<p>I would love to know what Albert Schweitzer would have had  to say about all of this. Too bad he isn&rsquo;t here to speak!  Of course, he would be denounced as a crusty old racist who just can&rsquo;t adjust to   &#8220;Change&#8221;.   [&#8220;that hopey  &mdash;  changey thing&#8221;]</p>

<p>Because of life-long indoctrination.  And because it&rsquo;s unpopular to say/or think outside the box.  And risky too!  Group pressure for conformity is very strong.   It&rsquo;s the  &#8220;Emperor&rsquo;s Clothes&#8221;  syndrome:  nobody wants to be thought stupid!  Or evil, or   (worst of all)  racist!</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s Europe, being stupid can get you ostracized and laughed at.    But being &#8220;racist&#8221; will get you fines and prison terms. <br>

<p>It also has poor soil, lots of rocks, little natural wealth,  hardly any growing season, and lots of cold water everywhere you look  (half the country is water). Other than reindeer and trees, what have they got?</p>
<p>Oh, yes   &mdash;   snow!  There&rsquo;s plenty of snow.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it has an enviable  standard of living, and has been rated for several years in a row as the &#8220;best country in the world&#8221;  to live in, with the best education, quality of life, and many other things. </p>

<p>Just one quick note;  Exploration of Sub-Saharan Africa did not take place until the mid 19th century with the likes of Dr. Livingston, Sir Richard Burton, John H. Speke.  Before this time, no white man ever got far into the interior, nor did any who tried live to come out.  But the savagery they braved was well documented.</p>

		<p>Whites should simply leave Africa and let it turn itself into a primitive 10,000 BC Continent that it should be. </p>
<p>Eventually, the Africans will run out of AK-47 bullets, they will stop shooting each other and go back to killing each other the way they always have, with spears.  </p>
<p>The attempt to colonize or modernize or improve Africa has been a dismal failure, as succeeding generations of Mrs. Jellby&rsquo;s go there and discover the truth, or don&rsquo;t because they are blinded by their own ideology.  A Continent that has a population with an average IQ of 67 is never going to build a sea going ship, a two story house, or develop a written language. </p>
<p>The Brazilians quite rightfully abandoned efforts to improve the natives living in the Amazon River basin. They just let them remain as they have for 10,000 years.  The same should be done in Africa.</p>

		<p>Whiteplight, you are certainly correct.  At the time I posted, I was so fired up about the story that I didn&rsquo;t think about dates!  It&rsquo;s just that so many observations rang similar to what I remember reading and it just blew me away.</p>
<p>And I was fortunate to learn about some of these older sources due to different Amren posters making mention of such books from time to time.  So thank you all, and Happy New Year everybody!!</p>

		<p>The Congo region is a treasure house of minerals. It is bisected by a huge, navigable river and enjoys an excellent location in the center of a continent. It is very similar with Brazil. It should be an economic powerhouse. But neither country is a success. Wonder why?</p>

		<p>Yes it is a very enthralling story. The 30 days in the Congo was part of a 2 year trip. </p>
<p>The condition of the roads is amazing, especially because those roads were paved 40 years ago and now just ruts. The people sit around all day and expect the Chinese or the Europeans to come fix them. 300 mile drives that should take 3-4 days can take a month or more when trucks get stuck and sit for weeks.</p>

Interesting!  I recently read a magazine story about Finland&rsquo;s huge and extremely successful Nokia company. It began originally as a small pulp mill and producer of forest products. Then, it shifted to making rubber snow shoes. <br>
  <br>
At the end of WW2,  finding themselves nearly bankrupt, they began supplying cable to the Soviet Union as part of the onerous war reparations that Finland was forced to pay.  As payment was required in the form of industrial goods, Finland had to reorganize its production structure.  This actually paid off for them, as it stimulated rapid industrial development of the country. (The Soviet debt was paid off, fully, and on time, in 1952.)  Next, sensing the wave of the future,  Nokia got into transistors and cell phones&hellip;. And the rest is history!</p>
<p>Who would have imagined that a maker of paper pulp and snow shoes would become the world&rsquo;s largest manufacturer of mobile telephones? </p>
<p>Today, the high-tech Nokia company is considered  a model of streamlined corporate structure. Incidentally,  the official language of Nokia is English. All documentation is written in English, and English is used in all official spoken communication and e-mail.</p>
<p>When I was in Finland, I was astonished at how well everyone spoke English, even the kids   &mdash;   without even an accent!</p>
<p>Another thing: while Africa is always looking for hand-outs, charity, aid,  and more loans (which will eventually be forgiven), Finland is the only European country which repaid its U.S. war debt, in full   &mdash;   and in gold no less.</p>

		<p>Did anyone else catch the notation of documented cannibalism in 2006?  Cutting off ears and frying them?  Cooking young women and children?</p>
<p>These two were utter fools to do what they did and even worse not to have learned anything of real value in the experience. </p>
<p>If an experience like this does not cause an awakening - what would?<br>

		<p>#16 Bull Market:</p>
<p>No need to wonder. Here&rsquo;s what Dr Schweitzer actually said&hellip;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I have given my life to alleviate the sufferings of Africa. There is something that all white men that have lived here must learn and know; that these individuals are a sub-race; they have neither the intellectual, mental or emotional abilities to equate or share in any of the functions of our civilization. I have given my life to try and bring them the advantages which our civilization must offer, but I have become well aware that we must retain this status; white, the superior, and they the inferior, for whenever a white man seeks to live among them as their equal, they will either destroy him or devour him, and they will destroy all his work; and so for any existing relationship or for any benefit to this people let white men from anywhere in the world who would come to help Africa remember that you must continually retain the status; you the master, and they inferior, like children that you would help or teach. Never fraternize with them as equals, never accept them as your social equals; or they will devour you; they will destroy you.&#8221;</em></p>
