<h1><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/dec/28/murder-on-the-border/">Murder on the Border</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Editorial, Washington Times, December 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Brian Terry died for President Obama&rsquo;s sins. Mr. Terry, a U.S. Border Patrol agent, was killed during operations against bandits near the southern Arizona town of Rio Rico, approximately 15 miles inside the U.S. border. Here and along other infiltration routes, gangsters prey on illegal aliens and drug smugglers or serve as private security forces for gangs engaged in illegal activities. Agent Terry was part of a four-man Border Patrol Tactical Unit sent to engage the bandits, and he was shot down in the resulting firefight.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano offered condolences to Mr. Terry&rsquo;s family but met a sharp rejoinder from his father, Kent, who said, &#8220;You gotta wake your man up in the White House.&#8221; Ms. Napolitano countered that Mr. Obama has &#8220;done more in the last two years than any other president,&#8221; and when pressed by reporters on the matter said she did not &#8220;think it appropriate for the media to try to pick this as a fight.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>The Terry family called Ms. Napolitano&rsquo;s claim that Mr. Obama has done more than any other president to deal with border security &#8220;empty words,&#8221; and the notion is easily proved false. Whatever accomplishments the Obama administration may claim, they pale against the aggressive and successful border-security policies President Eisenhower pursued in the 1950s. Woodrow Wilson&rsquo;s response to cross-border activity by Mexican gangs was to send 4,800 troops over the border. Mr. Obama&rsquo;s most notable actions have been to unleash the Justice Department on Arizona for taking small steps to try to deal with the problem of illegals and to push the Dream Act, a backdoor amnesty nightmare that thankfully ended when the Senate woke up and defeated it.</p>
<p>Worsening conditions in the United States reflect the situation in northern Mexico, which resembles a full-scale insurgency. There, the &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; is not just a slogan; it&rsquo;s a daily struggle fought with guns and machetes. {snip} In Juarez, Mexico, across the Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas, almost nine people are killed on average per day, making it proportionately the most violent city in the world. Conditions there are so dangerous that college football players from Notre Dame and Miami in El Paso for the Sun Bowl have surrendered their passports to their coaches and been briefed by the FBI on the perils of crossing the border.</p>
<p>Northern Mexico is descending into drug-fueled chaos and soon will join the list of the world&rsquo;s ungovernable spaces. {snip}<br>

		<p>Thanks for keeping this story alive. Here in Southern Arizona, as all over the country, we have heard LITTLE of this tragedy. Mexicans  &mdash;  here illegally  &mdash;  kill other Mexicans  &mdash;  also here illegally, and when a U.S. Border Patrol officer attempts to establish order, he&rsquo;s murdered &hellip; by illegal invaders in this officer&rsquo;s own land. And no one blinks. </p>
<p>Napolitano and Holder and all the anti-Arizona Obama-zombies are braind-dead, thick, evil.</p>

		<p>There will be atrocities on the border much greater than this one in the very near future.</p>
<p>But the greatest threats from this present danger will be against police personnel and will come from the drug gangs established in this country with real political power.</p>
<p>With roughly one hundred billion dollars in play every year from illegal drug profits, can anyone understand that it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible to have such a criminally lucrative enterprise unless payoffs are reaching the hands of high level officials in the federal and state government?  Is this why they refuse to guard the border?</p>
<p>Many threats to national security are converging on this empire all at the same time:  The ongoing economic plunge is continuing its downward spiral; drug gangs have established 200 points of distribution in the US, along with payoffs and corruption of local and federal officials; cartels are in the process of taking over COMPLETE control of Mexico, which will result in a war with Mexico and an insurgency against the feds in the Southwest; and the inundation of large populations of muslims many of who are preaching or in active jihad mode against the US; and blacks from war torn and/or corrupt countries in Africa, Haiti and Jamaica are not able to contribute to society and are placing undue burdens on social services and the courts which are right now in the process of cracking badly.  (They will soon go broke.)</p>
<p>Too, it has to be pointed out that we have a multi-million population of Mexicans here whose loyalty is only to Mexico and their race and they will join with their tribesmen in any battle against the federal government.</p>
<p>And to add to all these calamities it has to be pointed out that food, water and other resources are in short supply, although even if they were plentiful ANY Kind of stoppage or disruption of freight hauling systems could see the super market shelves bare in just two or three days in every city that is affected.</p>
<p>Never has so many threats to this country converged at the same time in this country, and all of them have the potential in and of themselves to completely destroy this empire more effectively than a nuclear attack.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the midst of a situational Katrina that has winds in excess of two hundred miles per hour and is so large it encompasses the entire contiguous USA.  </p>

		<p>Details are still scarce, but this was a significant firefight between a four-man Border Patrol tactical unit and five well armed adversaries, which ended with reinforcements tracking and arresting the gang in a place called Peck Canyon.  </p>
<p>Are we already so numb to wartime death that military action and fatal casualties on U.S. soil don&rsquo;t rate more than a footnote in the media?</p>
<p>Are they saving their ink and ire for the next &#8216;noose hoax&rsquo;?</p>

		<p><i>Terry was a member of a four man tactical unit</i> says the article?  What the hell was supervision thinking?  Border Patrol Agents are law enforcement not army or marine units organized into fire teams.  </p>
<p>I suspect that if one reviews Agent training one will see that it is heavy on such things as law, pistol shooting, physical fitness, and likely a little Spanish language thrown in as well.  Search the training and operations guidance and squad fire and maneuver ops probably will never be mentioned.</p>
<p>But this is the crux of the problem isn&rsquo;t it?  Law enforcement is being asked to do the job of the military&hellip;..because of PC and gutless politicians and political appointees to DHS. </p>
<p>One army combat brigade deployed to AZ would do the trick in a couple of weeks. What, we can&rsquo;t use the military to enforce civil law?  No such consideration was given the Branch Dividians.  </p>
<p>I would like to have a great deal more details about the shooting,but I sense that DHS is in full CYA cover up mode.  At this point don&rsquo;t believe a word these senior government political apparatchiks say.   </p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly, but the best policy might be to NEVER believe what they might say.  This is the most racist, corrupt administration in recent times.</p>
<p>Without exaggerating one bit I think I can say that these people are the greatest enemies we have on the planet, worse even than the jihadists, because they are no more than terrorists themselves. </p>

		<p>Not only does the US have an army in Afghanistan, but it has soldiers and military bases unnecessarily stationed all over the world. There&rsquo;s no reason why the military bases in Europe are needed 65 years after WWII and nearly 20 years after the Cold War. One would think that the largest and most expensive military in the world would at least be stationed to protect its own southern border. </p>
