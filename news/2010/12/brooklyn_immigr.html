<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/nyregion/29church.html?_r=3&amp;src=twt&amp;twt=nytimes">Brooklyn Immigrant Congregations Clash</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Dolnick, New York Times, December 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The United Methodist church in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, is anything but united.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two very different congregations share the soaring brick building on Fourth Avenue: a small cadre of about 30 Spanish-speaking people who have worshiped there for decades and a fledgling throng of more than 1,000 Chinese immigrants that expands week by week  &mdash;  the fastest-growing Methodist congregation in New York City.</p>
<p>The Latinos say they feel steamrolled and under threat, while their tenants, the Chinese, say they feel stifled and unappreciated. Mediators have been sent in, to little effect. This holiday season, there are even two competing Christmas trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;This pastor is very rude to us,&#8221; said the Rev. Zhaodeng Peng, who heads the Chinese congregation with his wife.</p>
<p>The Rev. Hector Laporta, leader of the Latino church, responded, &#8220;He really has an anger problem.&#8221;</p>

		<p>White Christian groups bring in these Christianized Asians hoping to teach them how to vote, etc.  Most convert simply to get into the U.S.  But all this really does is further the threat to whites in general through continuing the Balkanization of America.</p>

		<p>Wow, where to begin!</p>
<p>This comment from the original article was rich:<br>
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not our church anymore; that&rsquo;s the way we feel,&rdquo; said Oswaldo Nieves, 70, a Puerto Rican who has attended the Latino church for eight years. &ldquo;They are eliminating us slowly, slowly.&rdquo; </p>
<p>So, now Latinos can find out what whites feel like. That is just what they are doing to us in many places the USA, not just the Southwest. Now Latinos can find out just how they will be treated when China comes to dominate the world, and surely the USA. This is rich!! What goes around comes around!!</p>
<p>And just why are there so many immigrants coming in from China weekly? How did that happen? It has been said that there are many illegal immigrants from China coming here. Why is there no media attention? Notice the orginal article does not touch that topic.</p>
<p>It should also be a lesson for whites in how we will be treated by the Chinese!!</p>

		<p>Look for the National Association of Diversity Journalists to put out the kibosh on reports of Diversity vs. Diversity clashes.  Whites must not see that the Diversity Curse doesn&rsquo;t uphold our &#8220;universal values of the dignity and equality of each human being.&#8221;   Diversity must always be spoken of in terms of how it enriches White American, never that is has a streak of non assimilation.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t mix linen with wool in the same garment.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hitch a horse and a cow to the same plow.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t mix seeds of different plants in the same furrow.</p>
<p>There is a reason for such admonitions. From the Bible.</p>
<p>Or am I being too simplistic? I ask you.</p>

		<p>First off, neither should be here.  White people created this country, it&rsquo;s a white nation.  The article points out at the end Norwegians built the church.  CNN did a special called &#8220;Latino in America&#8221; where they showcased a very similar thing happening with a white and Latino congregation in NYC.  In that case the white people were there first.  The Latinos didn&rsquo;t want to go to any events held by the white congregants instead they set up their own events for themselves, didn&rsquo;t even invite the white congregants of the same church.</p>

		<p>Very brave of the New York Times to print a story about how different cultures prefer their own.  I would add that this is the wave of the future where the Asians could care less about the sensitivities of Hispanics and Black.  Be organized, be productive, grow in influence or get out of the way.  And the Asians will succeed in displacing the Hispanics because no one dares hobble them with claims of racism.  Asians are exempt.  Conversely, if it was whites displacing the Hispanics it would be a major civil rights struggle inclusive of an investigation.</p>

I&rsquo;m really very surprised that this story was reported at all. Especially in the NYT.  I wonder how it slipped through. It&rsquo;s not generally considered the kind of &#8220;news that&rsquo;s fit to print&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I have always been astounded at how the children of Buddha so readily convert to this or that sect of christianity.  They have no idea at the centuries of conflict that caused so many competing sects.  In my area, it seems the chinese and korean christians use their affiliations as a social and economic vehicle of advancement.</p>
<p>Well, Buddha was an Indian, but the orientals made him out to be like them, so when will we see a chinese jesus?</p>

What are we to make of the New York Times?</p>
<p>These are the people who provide us with numerous articles highlighting the failure of inclusion, tolerance, and diversity.</p>
<p>Why do they keep reporting on these issues? Are they totally ignorant of divisive consequences of diversity ? Is there an agenda that we&rsquo;re missing? Or are these people truly stunned every time they report on another failure of diversity?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if no one at the New York Times reads the New York Times. If they did, you would think they would have connected the dots by now.</p>

		<p>Religions a farce and this exposes that. Racial solidarity  and identity trumps all and &#8220;God&#8221; is used to justify people&rsquo;s own prejudices and supremacy&rsquo;s (muslims play this to the ultimate end). The problem is is that white Christians are the only ones that get slammed for this behaviour.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, the only issue that hyphenated Americans agree on is that White men are the enemy. They remind me of scavengers on the African plain fighting over the body of a large giraffe (about 2000 pounds of edibles). Lions, hyenas, jackals, buzzards, etc. all anxious to get some before its gone. They fight viciously with each other, but none will help the giraffe. </p>

<p>It comes down to a lot more than that, Tim.  Centuries of Christianity couldn&rsquo;t stop Europeans (who are members of the same race but different ethnic groups) from fighting one another.<br>
 What made anyone think it would unite people of different races?</p>
<p>By the way, you see the same thing happening alot with the adherents of &#8220;the Religion of Peace&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Strange how the Latinos are not reminded of the benefits they receive from the rich diversity brought by the Chinese immigrants. </p>
<p>Strange how they are not caricatured as out of touch bigots for not welcoming the privilege being made minorities in their own community.</p>
<p>Strange how the Latino Minister is not told to take sensitivity training and ordered to learn Chinese.</p>
<p>I wonder why that would be?</p>

		<p>Read the entire article over at the NYT and you&rsquo;ll see they don&rsquo;t frame it as a racial issue at all. It&rsquo;s framed as a religious rift, nothing more. Plus, the article makes sure to score plenty of political correctness brownie points by gushing over the &#8220;vibrancy&#8221; of the neighborhood the church is in, etc.</p>
