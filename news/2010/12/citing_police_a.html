<h1>Citing Police Abuse, Hispanics Leaving Conn. Town</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Melia, San Francisco Chronicle, December 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Santiago Malave has worked law enforcement jobs in Connecticut for more than four decades, but as a Puerto Rican, he says he cannot drive through his own town without worrying about police harassing him.</p>
<p>Malave, a probation officer who works in New Haven, says the racial abuse is so bad that he only crosses the town line into East Haven to go home. He and his wife are now preparing to sell their house and move, joining an exodus of Hispanics who say police have hassled them with traffic stops, false arrests and even jailhouse beatings.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has started a civil rights investigation, and the FBI recently opened a criminal probe. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&rsquo;t tolerate the town anymore,&#8221; said Malave, 64. &#8220;For us to leave our beautiful home is something that hurts, but we can&rsquo;t deal with these people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Racial profiling allegations began swirling about two years ago in East Haven, a predominantly Italian-American seaside suburb of about 28,000 people 70 miles northeast of New York City. Hispanics make up only about 7 percent of the population, but their numbers had been growing as the peaceful, small-town setting and thriving businesses attracted newcomers from Mexico and Ecuador.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanic business owners say police made a practice of parking outside their shops and stopping any Latinos. Some who complained say they faced retaliation.</p>
<p>Luis Rodriguez, an immigrant from Ecuador who owns the Los Amigos Grocery, said he was arrested two months ago and jailed for five days after a woman pointed out to police that his 3-year-old son was unsupervised on the sidewalk outside the store. He said police were out for revenge because his wife had been videotaping them. He was charged with child neglect; the case is still pending.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his store is up for sale. {snip}Rodriguez said police have scared customers away by threatening to alert immigration authorities if they ever saw them in town again.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s civil rights branch began investigating the police force in September 2009. It is still looking into alleged discriminatory policing, but it identified preliminary concerns in April over issues including outdated policies and a lack of clear guidance on the use of force.</p>
<p>The town&rsquo;s mayor, April Capone, revealed this month that the FBI was gathering evidence for potential criminal prosecutions of some of the officers. {snip}</p>
<p>Dermot Lynch, a student intern with Yale Law School&rsquo;s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, said the problem goes beyond a few rogue officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a systemwide leadership failure. It&rsquo;s going to need widespread reform,&#8221; said Lynch, whose group filed a lawsuit in October on behalf of nine immigrants who say East Haven police abused them with beatings and unwarranted use of a stun gun. It also quotes officers using ethnic slurs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Malave, who has lived here since 1977, said he never had problems before late 2008 when police responded to a report by his wife that some money was missing. The couple had begun to argue. Malave, who was asked his nationality, said police arrested him for disorderly conduct the minute he said he was born in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to talk to the sergeant, but he said, &#8216;You spics don&rsquo;t have rights here,&rsquo;&#8221; said Malave, a former New Haven police officer.</p>
<p>Hispanics in East Haven say more than half their population  &mdash;  estimated at 1,900 by the Census Bureau  &mdash;  has moved away.</p>
<p>Mario Marin, who was at work one recent afternoon in his family&rsquo;s empty restaurant, La Bamba, said two of his siblings moved to nearby Waterbury and another brother returned to Ecuador. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They destroyed our future here,&#8221; Marin said of police. He said even out-of-town diners have stopped coming since officers launched raids on the restaurant&rsquo;s parking lot, towing away any cars with out-of-state license plates.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the allegations made against the police are true.  The Hispanics in the article could be committing crimes. The mainstream media believe any racial grievance talk from a non-white. However, I don&rsquo;t see any articles written about white people who have left their home state of California because of the invasion of illegal aliens. Some white children were being harrassed by Hispanics in the schools and once peaceful towns are becoming more and more crime infested. It is shameful that the media always seem to frame the issues in terms of non-whites as victims. </p>

<p>Well, Milia, do you think the businesses are thriving now?  If you do you have to be living in a cave, which is a very real possibility.  Your lying hit piece could never get published in anything but a liberal rag, because too many assertions point up the probability that you&rsquo;re a mestizo and you published ludicrous allegations, hoping to intimidate the police and public into being reluctant to arrest and or criticize your mestizo tribesmen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all for naught, though.  2011 will just about accelerate the train wreck that was expected to be about right now.  But, nothing&rsquo;s changed except the time element.  We&rsquo;re going just a wee bit slower.</p>
<p>The sign posts still tell us quite clearly that economic chaos is just ahead.</p>

Stuff like this is almost common protocol in New England and other northern states. Reading the article, didn&rsquo;t surprise me in the least.</p>
<p>Racial resistance towards non- whites is &#8220;real&#8221; but  usually &#8220;convert&#8221;, embedded in the social, political and economic machinery of the north, while the south was comparatively &#8220;overt&#8221; and led to their undoing.</p>
<p>All those protesters, anarchists and change agents should&rsquo;ve stayed north of the Potomac during the 60&rsquo;s &amp; 70&rsquo;s. They obviously had alot more to do right there and could&rsquo;ve saved themselves a heap of traveling.</p>
<p>On one hand I&rsquo;m proud and appreciate the resistance that goes on up there, I just can&rsquo;t stand the total hypocracy and denial that goes along with it. </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s one way to stop the invasion. But there are problems: (1)other &#8220;minority&#8221; groups will grow stronger in the vacuum and (2) the FBI isn&rsquo;t a friendly on this one (as if they ever are). </p>

		<p>Stopping cars with out of state plates, or expired tags, with latino drivers in front of a western union money gram store is like shooting fish in a barrel for finding: no license, expired license, no insurance, no registration, no safety inspection, stolen plates, stolen stickers, stolen cars, warrants, drugs, drunk drivers, equipment violations, and if they are empowered to ask a few simple questions finding tons of illegals. Hopefully their jail system has a means of deporting the illegals they do find, and has a deal in place with ICE to have them picked up. </p>
<p>Merely standing in front of one of these places with a video camera, and a two way radio is enough to make many illegals circle the parking lot, and leave. They can&rsquo;t claim they were not the driver when you have it on tape. </p>
<p>The businesses may not like it, but its not any different from the police sitting in front of a bar at closing time, and looking for intoxicated drivers. Yes, it does hurt business a bit, but if you are targeting certain types of offenses it makes sense to hunt where the hunting has the highest chance of success. </p>

		<p>Having lived with both these groups - immigrant, lower class Hispanics and Italian Americans who don&rsquo;t cut and run until it is really, really bad - I have to say the story sounds accurate. Italian Americans here are simply defending their turf - not letting it get run down, taken over. </p>
<p>Italian Americans are generally the most consistantly &#8220;racist&rsquo; White group in the world and we need to get over this upper class aversion to being &#8220;racist&#8221; in the down in the street, defend the turf sort of way.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all get out of our ivorty WASP towers and get to know Italian Americans like the late great Philly police chief/mayor Frank Rizzo. Italian Americans like Frank Rizzo will save our people when the worst of the non Whites start getting ideas of rioting, raping, shakedowns etc</p>

		<p>The Hispanic&rsquo;s and black&rsquo;s never talk about all of the people that they drive away, including their own, because of their criminal and anti social behavior. This article is supposed to tug at your heart string&rsquo;s because of the racist behavior of the police. Most likely it is only the police doing their job. Another case of dammed if you do dammed if you don&rsquo;t, and this is in CT one of the bluest and most affluent of state&rsquo;s. Imagine the outcry if the police took no action. Don&rsquo;t hold your breath waiting for the San Francisco Chronicle to do an article about the savage conduct of these minority group&rsquo;s and the problem&rsquo;s they cause for all.</p>

		<p>It seems like there is one thing that many are trying to step around. And that is the role of like and dislike in situations like this. What some whites feel guilty about or are assumed to feel guilty about is that we are not being &#8220;fair&#8221; to the Hispanics. What I&rsquo;ve heard about California, the Hispanic view is that this land is a faceless free-for-all where anyone is entitled to benefit in any way he sees fit. And, since they assume that this is the mindset of the white population and the American dream, this becomes their definition of &#8220;fair&#8221;.</p>
<p>Whites are being displaced in California. If this is their other definition of &#8220;fair&#8221;, I want to say it aloud, that according to this definition, all the allegiations in this article, even if they were true, fit into that definition of &#8220;fair&#8221;. And that is what causes the odd mixed feeling of guilt and confusion with a feeling of &#8220;getting even&#8221; when reading this.</p>

		<p>My family was originally from New Haven, CT, as I have mentioned in several of my posts. Let&rsquo;s have some ariticles in San Francisco about how whites had to flee the city in the 1960&rsquo;s and 1970&rsquo;s to the suburbs outside New Haven due to violence and crime against us by non-whites!!</p>
