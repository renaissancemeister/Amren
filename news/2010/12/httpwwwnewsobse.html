<h1>NAACP Head Calls Out Wake County</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jay Price, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), December 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The head of the NAACP looked down from the podium at his group&rsquo;s first national educational summit in three years, picked that tone that says &#8220;you all know what I mean&#8221; and uttered just two words: &#8220;Wake County.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Then Benjamin Todd Jealous, who is the president and CEO of the group, made it clear that the Wake school board&rsquo;s efforts to end diversity-based school assignment have made the county a front line for his group.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not a mistake we are in Wake County,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have watched desegregation roll for 20 years in this country, but when folks start getting bold about it, when they start putting it out on the street in clear terms, talking about our children as animals released from cages, resurrecting the rhetoric of none other than Barry Goldwater, then it&rsquo;s time for the family to gather together, and it&rsquo;s time for the family to go back out into the country and tell them what is going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The meeting, held at the Raleigh Sheraton, drew more than 200 people from around the country. They came to talk broadly about education issues and also about what they see as huge steps backward in Wake and other places where desegregation is being reversed.</p>
<p>NAACP leaders said that a trend to return to neighborhood schools and reduce busing of students has pushed separation by race in U.S. schools to its highest level in four decades, with two-thirds of black and Latino students now assigned to schools having at least 90 percent minority enrollment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Two investigations</b></p>
<p>Complaints by the NAACP have sparked probes into the school system. The U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s Office for Civil Rights is looking into an accusation that the school board is practicing racial discrimination through student assignment and other policies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also investigating the school system&rsquo;s actions is the national accreditation group Advancing Excellence in Education Worldwide, which has the power to withdraw accreditation from Wake&rsquo;s high schools. That could make it harder for students to gain admission to some universities and to receive financial aid for college.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jealous vowed that the pressure won&rsquo;t stop with the investigations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ain&rsquo;t going to let go of Wake County till Wake County admits that what it&rsquo;s been doing for a long time is the right thing and that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s going to stay,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>We just want to hear them admit what Integration means to them:</p>
<p>Supervising White children so they can be punished by the Diversity Curse when forming impermissible White Identities.</p>
<p>Harassing White girls who don&rsquo;t eagerly date black bucks.</p>
<p>Keeping White academic standards down to lowest afrovoodoo denominator.</p>
<p>Punishing Whites for unearned White Privilege by preventing them from having anything that is just their own. </p>
<p>Breaking down natural instinctive resistance (virtuous prejudicial habit) by constant exposure and demoralization.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
No matter what they say, it&rsquo;s always an attack on Whites, not an uplift program for blacks.</p>
<p>For every one degree of uplift a black gets, ten Whites suffer a degradation of ten each.</p>
<p>Whenever you see White acting blacks, in their train are a hundred suffering Whites who were held back so the blacks could make little advances.</p>
<p>Civil Rights for Whites Only! Segregation Again!  Dixie Rising!</p>
<p>Restorative Justice- War and Reconstruction Reparations for White Southerners!</p>
<p>Poetic Justice- Integrate the White synagogues with afrovoodoo inclusion, especially in the most intimate and social ways possible.  <br>

		<p>lol, did Barry Goldwater threaten to nuke black children? Did he suggest all parents should be free to send their kids where ever they want to, 4 decades ago? That was kind of bizarre. Wouldn&rsquo;t it have suited their political ends to denounce a &#8216;racist&rsquo; a bit more contemporary, like Sarah Palin? Do they have non-profit status?</p>

<p>Someone needs to explain to my why this is an issue.</p>
<p>Are we to believe that blacks can&rsquo;t learn in a majority minority environment? If true, why? Are White children more motivated and more intelligent? Do blacks see Whites as so superior that even being around them makes blacks better? Are blacks saying that without Whites, they would fail at everything they do? Do black &#8220;leaders&#8221; understand how hopeless and pathetic they see their own people?</p>

&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t going to let go of Wake County till Wake County admits that what it&rsquo;s been doing for a long time is the right thing and that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s going to stay,&rdquo; he said.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Hooks in, hands out.  Forever.</p>
<p>Never a better choice of words or name for the man who uttered them.  Jealous.</p>
<p>Does anyone remember the study, back in 1964 or so which showed that black schools in the south were receiving -better funding- as standalones than the white schools they faced?</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t see a reference source for the &#8216;animals released from cages&rsquo; quote except as the NAACP rep who uses it like a phantom whip.</p>
<p>And speaking of &#8216;the board and it&rsquo;s arbitrary selections&rsquo;-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Jealous was elected by the NAACP National Board of Directors in a 34-21 vote. CNN reported that &#8220;no one clapped or celebrated,&#8221; according to one board member after the meeting.[1] According to CNN, Jealous was the only finalist presented by the search committee to the full board for consideration despite there being other qualified candidates. Although some board members wanted to examine two others whom the search committee identified as finalists, Jealous&rsquo;s supporters, including Chairman Julian Bond, prevented their presentation to the board.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Whatever way the wind swings, so long as you can set your sail by it, eh Mr. Jealous?</p>
<p>So drop all public schooling, set up community based schools and fund them privately using tax codes and residential tax code values that are functionally &#8216;selective&rsquo;.  Then introduce a bill in the N.C. legislature that frees parents from having to pay double, if they will instead take a voucher to be applied to the school of their choice.</p>
<p>Poor whites and blacks will stay in the system of institutionalized day care we call public education.  The rest will figure out that this is the new way of doing things and _because whites can organize, constructively_, give their kids a real chance at life.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see how hooded night-riders could scare blacks into thinking they were ghosts or demons.  One hundred and fifty years later, blacks are still imagining bugaboos whenever their leaders yell &#8220;Boo!&#8221;  And now that these leaders can find few or no real legal challenges, the bugaboos will abound.</p>

		<p>Yawn, the NAACP needs to get a new gig. I am bored with them. Does anybody still take them seriously anymore? These ambulance chasing race hustlers. If the NAACP comes after you then you know that you are doing something right. At which point you keep doing it. </p>
<p>Oh by the way, the Department of education is a joke, as are most federal agencies. They should go bye bye.</p>

		<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s just so much &#8220;hate&#8221; in Wake County, that the NAACP was able to boldly hold its conference there while insulting the residents. Of course, American Renaissance has to keep the venues for its conferences a secret until a few days before the events just to avoid being harassed by &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; terrorists. Then again, it&rsquo;s just proof that whites are far more likely to act in a civilized manner than the blacks and wiggers whom we&rsquo;re supposed to look upon as &#8220;freedom fighters&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Black professional agitators are not happy with desegregation so now they push forced integration. Rather than looking at themselves and realizing there are manifold legitimate reasons whites constantly distance themselves from large black populations, they just chalk it all up to &#8220;evil racism&#8221;. I think it&rsquo;s called projection in psychological circles.  </p>
<p>Some folks refuse to take a hint&hellip;     </p>

		<p>If the NAACP truly believes in racial equality, then it ought not matter to them the racial composition of a given school.  It shouldn&rsquo;t matter which race of students is or is not in a given school.  However, the NAACP isn&rsquo;t as egalitarian as they would like to think   &mdash;   They implicitly admit what we all know through common sense observation   &mdash;   The whiter the school, the better the school.</p>
<p>2 Anonymous:  And Goldwater was a libertarian.  He opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for the same reason he opposed the &#8220;religious right&#8221; after he retired from the Senate.  Not only because Goldwater&rsquo;s political career was so long ago, and he&rsquo;s been dead for 12 years, one would think the NAACP could dig up a bogeyman a little closer to so-called &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; than Goldwater (see below) and a little closer to Raleigh than Phoenix and a little closer to alive than having died in 1998 and a little closer to credible power than retiring in 1987.</p>
<p>In his autobio, Goldwater said that he was the engineer of the policy which saw his family&rsquo;s eponymous department store chain in Phoenix be the first real big retail outlet in the city to hire blacks, way back in the late 1940s.  Then again, Phoenix didn&rsquo;t have many blacks then (or now), so it wasn&rsquo;t the same kind of &#8220;civil rights&#8221; coup that integrating the workforce of a department store chain in Alabama at the same time would have been.  Incidentally, the Goldwater family sold their chain to May, which rebranded them Foley&rsquo;s, and May later sold out to Federated, which recently turned them into Macy&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I bet. If the NAACP gets its way it&rsquo;s ultimately the fault of whites who don&rsquo;t have the courage to obtain what&rsquo;s best for their own children by electing politicians who will help them protect their children.<br>

		<p>As usual, what&rsquo;s best for non-black students doesn&rsquo;t enter into consideration, only what&rsquo;s best for blacks. White children are always the sacrificial lambs to improve the educational environment of the under preforming black students. Whites &amp; Asians are on average much better behaved and academically much better performing so naturally their presence makes the better environment. Also busing out black students, while negatively impacting the normally white majority schools, removes many of the problem and unruly black students from the normally black schools. Do liberal whites think that black parents would do the same for them. Shame on the white liberals for letting this injustice of busing happen.</p>
