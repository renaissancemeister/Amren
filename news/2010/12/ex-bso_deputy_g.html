<h1>Ex-BSO Deputy Gets 30 Years for Raping Prisoner</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa J. Huriash, Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale), December 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A former Broward Sheriff&rsquo;s Office corrections deputy was sentenced Thursday to 30 years in prison for raping a handcuffed prisoner he was moving from one jail to another.</p>
<p>Charles Edward Floyd, 40, wept openly in court as he addressed his wife and then his mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Baby, I&rsquo;m sorry, I gotta go. Don&rsquo;t cry for me,&#8221; he sobbed. &#8220;Mom, I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>His wife, who told the judge Floyd was a good man, ran down the hallway after the sentencing, crying and throwing up.</p>
<p>In September a jury convicted Floyd of kidnapping and two counts of sexual battery by a person in a position of control or authority.</p>
<p>Before trial, he had turned down a plea offer of five years in prison, to be followed by 20 years of probation. His sentence was for 30 years on each count, to be served concurrently. {snip}</p>
<p>The victim testified that on June 13, 2007, she was one of three female inmates the deputy was transporting. Floyd dropped off the other two women and took her to a remote area behind a warehouse, where he told her, &#8220;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for this all day.&#8221;</p>
<p>She testified that he forced her to perform oral sex and raped her. Prosecutors said Floyd&rsquo;s DNA was found in the woman&rsquo;s cervix.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Floyd&rsquo;s mother had appealed for a lighter sentence.</p>
<p>&#8220;My son has never been in trouble in his life,&#8221; she said as Floyd wiped tears from his eyes with shackled hands. &#8220;I never had problems with him ever, ever. He had a 3.6 grade [point] average, captain of the band.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Blacks always make fools of themselves by telling us what a &#8220;good boy&#8221; their criminals were, who &#8220;never got in trouble&#8221;.  They always say the same thing, almost as if they are trained, which they are.  They actually believe that either the black judges will give them leniency, or Whites will demand easier sentencing.    There is some voodoo code at work in much of what blacks say, and Whites never really understand it, we just respond with care and compassion and regret over the shameful past of Jim Crow segregation.  </p>
<p>We like it when blacks go on about how &#8220;good&#8221; dey crimnals be, because it makes it just a little bit harder for the few remaining health White school children to believe that diversity is our strength. </p>
<p>Blacks acting typical undoes months of diversity trained Whites.  Our prejudice is our healing.<br>

		<p>Evolutionary biologists have long debated why Africans have such an elevated sex drive, and why rape and multiple sexual partners are so common among Africans.  Two proximal factors may be low intelligence and elevated testosterone, which also may contribute to impulsive, violent behavior.  </p>
<p>However, the ultimate reason may be that Africans evolved in tropical and sub-tropical climates where most offspring died of disease.  As a result, whether or not the father raised the child (invested in the child) made no difference in his fitness   &mdash;   i.e., fitness was achieved by having as many children as possible by as many women as possible (a form of bet-hedging, such that at least one genetic combination will be resistant to the local pathogens).  </p>
<p>Aiding this is the fact that women and children do not immediately die when abandoned in the tropics, because there is always warmpth, water, and insects and leaves to eat.</p>
<p>In contrast, in northern Europe, there is ice for 6 months every year.  If a man who abandoned his mate and child, both would probably die.  Place a woman and a small child outside in Finland in mid winter and how long would they live?  Hours?</p>
<p>In cold, temperate zones, the best fitness strategy for a man is to form a bond with a women and remain with them to raise a small number of offspring (i.e, high investment).</p>
<p>In Africa, the best fitness strategy is to produce as many offspring as possible with as many different women as possible, and leave them to live or die. It&rsquo;s classic r- vs. K-strategy. This is also why black men abandon their baby-mommas and assorted children.  </p>

		<p>I used to work with a guy who had a son who almost got into a mess like that when he worked at the womens prison in Shakopee, MN. He told his dad that every male who works in the prison gets flashed every day at least once. They get plenty of offers of sexual favors, too.</p>
<p>One day the young guard accepted one of those favors and before he could even get his pants up the inmate told him if he didn&rsquo;t bring in drugs for her she would tell the captain he had raped her.</p>
<p>He agreed, but then he contacted state authorities who promised to let him resign without criminal charges if he would mule the drugs for the inmate so they could bust her and her supplier in the free world.</p>
<p>Former Deputy Floyd may have fallen into a similar trap.</p>
<p>They need to quit putting men in vulnerable positions by allowing them to work alone around female prisoners who more than likely have a devious nature.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t make a weak man sound like the victim. Men work alone around women all the time and don&rsquo;t turn into uncontrollable sex fiends. This is the same argument that Muslims use   &mdash;   that women need to be covered head to toe in bedsheets lest men&rsquo;s carnal desires take over and they get themselves raped. </p>
<p>I am a female working in a male-dominated career field. If I worked in corrections, I don&rsquo;t care if men were showing me their junk all day long. I am not going to mess around with one of them. For one, that&rsquo;s nasty. Two, there are standards to uphold being in a position of authority. Three, I am not going to throw my life and career away. Four, I took vows when I married that I intend to keep.</p>
<p>Your friend&rsquo;s son was rightly fired (allowed to resign) b/c he proved that he cannot be trusted in position of authority - the only reason he ratted on this inmate is b/c she blackmailed him. Otherwise, he may have continued his immoral and illegal behavior for the rest of his career - and corrections officer have one goal: to become a patrol cop. We certainly don&rsquo;t need someone like him out on the streets interacting daily with females. </p>

		<p>From Post # 3: &#8220;In Africa, the best fitness strategy is to produce as many offspring as possible with as many different women as possible, and leave them to live or die. It&rsquo;s classic r- vs. K-strategy. This is also why black men abandon their baby-mommas and assorted children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually this evolutionary strategy works even better inside European societies, because the abandoned black off-spring don&rsquo;t die (as would normally happen in Africa), instead, White people raise the abandoned black children and also support the abandoned black mother, so that she will stay healthy and can quickly breed and produce even more abandoned black babies by random fathers.  </p>
<p>Because the government transfers money from Whites to irresponsible blacks (i.e., taxes that go for welfare, Section 8 housing, affirmative action, prisons, etc.), Whites have less income, causing Whites to have less children.  Meanwhile, because Blacks are being supported by Whites, Black men are free to irresponsibly breed like crazy, while having Whites pay for their spawn.  </p>
<p>Our government forces us to pay for our own ethnic replacement.    </p>

<p>Since Floyd is 40 years old, how is his high school record remotely relevant?  Will we next be treated to the usual insulting nonsense about how this adult rapist is really a &#8220;youth&#8221; who &#8220;fell in with the wrong crowd&#8221;?</p>
<p>The other inmates won&rsquo;t get the opportunity to make his life miserable; Floyd will end up doing his sentence in protective custody, where he will be locked down in a 6 X 14 cell 23 hours a day.  He will be allowed several showers a week, and if the weather is nice, his hour out will be on a fenced-in dog track.  Visits will be &#8220;no contact&#8221; either via a video monitor or through a plexiglass window.  With a 30 year sentence, Floyd&rsquo;s going to serve 15 to 20 before parole, since rape is a violent crime.  That puts him at 55-60 when released to a halfway house, along with mandatory lifetime supervision of a sex offender and mandatory registration as one.  I&rsquo;ll bet the plea offer for five years, of which he&rsquo;d have served approximately 40 months seems pretty good right now.</p>
<p>All of that for a few minutes of bad sex?  That and the fact that Floyd didn&rsquo;t bother using protection but then took the case to a jury trial anyway, even though the DNA evidence would confirm the accusation, marks him out as stupid on a level normally reserved for insects and houseplants.  If he got a 3.6 GPA in high school, just how dumbed-down was the curriculum?<br>

<p>You apparently have no basis for comparison. There is a world of difference between working around women and working around women convicts. If your female co-workers start flashing you, rubbing up against you and feeling you up every chance they get you might discover a previously well-concealed weakness of your own. </p>
<p>Most jails and prisons don&rsquo;t allow private contact between women convicts and male staff because they understand that the behavior of the women convicts will test the self control of any man who is a true heterosexual. </p>

Your  hypothesis  is  just  wrong.  Don&rsquo;t  be  misled  by  Rushton who  has  been  dogmatically  pushing the  same  easily  falsifiable  hypothesis  for  years.</p>
<p>1)If cold  weather  required  more  effective  cognitive  skills  than  those  required  for  the  tropics  then  explain why the  Neanderthals  proved  to  be  no  match  in  terms  of  brain  power  with the  in-migrating  Africans  coming  from  tropical  regions.</p>
<p>2) One  only  has  to  enumerate  the  large  numbers  of  wantonly  created  offspring  of  white  males to  belie  the  silly  Rushton thesis  about  r  and  K  strategies.  North  America,  South  Africa,  Angola,  Mozambique, South  America and  Australasia constitute  glaring  proof  of  Euro  sexual  irresponsibility.  </p>
