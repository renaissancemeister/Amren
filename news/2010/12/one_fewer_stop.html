			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Kimball, Minnesota Post (St. Paul), December 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Santa Claus, as portrayed by Dennis Jackson, won&rsquo;t be visiting students at the Head Start classes in St. Peter this year.</p>
<p>Jackson has made appearances the past four years at the classes for students who need help preparing for school, but this year officials said, &#8220;No, no, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason: The classes have many immigrant children who don&rsquo;t celebrate Christmas, says the Mankato Free Press.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The official explanation from Chris Marben, who coordinates regional Head Start programs through Mankato-based Minnesota Valley Action Council: &#8220;We have Somali families in the program. We&rsquo;re respecting the wishes of families in the program.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The simple truth is that southern Minnesota has become a much more culturally diverse society than it was a few decades ago,&#8221; she told the paper. &#8220;Part of our challenge in Head Start is providing an environment where young children from many different cultures can all feel comfortable.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Black failure rates have prompted many policies to try to lift them up to white levels, one of which was &#8220;Head Start.&#8221;  Get them trained earlier so they won&rsquo;t fall so far behind later.  It has been a failed policy, of course, as we all know now&hellip;but didn&rsquo;t we say so before it was initiated?</p>
<p>Michelle Obama pretends she is working for all students when she advocates upgrading diets, encouraging them to eat right and lose weight, but she has no one else but blacks in mind.  No one else matters to her since she&rsquo;s the usual black nationalist.  </p>
<p>She&rsquo;s under the misconception that diet and an early start will help close the achievement gap, too dimwitted herself to understand that there are blacks throughout Africa that are proportionate, fit and well-fed, but it hasn&rsquo;t improved them intellectually one bit, and that the entire theory is just another hare-brained leftist lie, designed to avoid having to admit blacks are at the bottom of the learning totem pole of all the people of the earth.</p>
<p>The latest policy of the radically left, elitist mob is to hand out diplomas and degrees even though the course work isn&rsquo;t learned in order to increase blacks in the professions and business.</p>
<p>This too will end in chaos and failure.</p>

		<p>This is so sad.  St. Peter used to be one the nicest, whitest towns around.  There&rsquo;s a Swedish Lutheran college (Gustavus Adolphus) right on the main street.  When St. Peter got hit by a tornado about 12 years ago, there was an outpouring of assistance for the town in Minnesota.  Fortunately, they didn&rsquo;t need it.  Nearly everyone had insurance.  They wound up sending truckloads of clothing and furniture donations away.  They even returned some of the cash that was being donated.  Would Minnesotans had been so generous if the TV news had shown a diversity of people disaffected by the storm?</p>

		<p>She didn&rsquo;t say how many objections were made, but said more than one would be enough to cancel Santa.</p>
<p>Oh really! Well than, does that mean that if more than one objected to Santa being banned, would Santa be allowed to return? If more than one objected to Somalians even BEING in Minnesota, could they send them all back?<br>
Ya know, the liberal mind is really something to behold. I imagine that if these Somalians were &#8216;offended&rsquo; by us eating, the liberals would starve themselves to death - hey, I think I&rsquo;ve stumbled on an idea! Does anyone have a phone number to those Somalians in Minnesota? </p>

		<p>One of the largest employers in St. Peter is the security hospital for the criminally insane. I am not joking or exaggerating when I tell you that the local folks have been deeply affected by those who dwell behind the walls. Many of them became crazier than an out house rats from working every day in close proximity with the darkest, most dangerous minds in the state of Minnesota. </p>
<p>You can bet that some of the people behind the decision to give Santa the boot over the feelings of a few Somalis have the Security Hospital on their resumes. </p>

<p>What it comes down to is these children are Muslims and this is just another way of caving into Islam. If Chris Marben was really concerned about the children she would take Christmas as a time to introduce the children to the diverse culture that they now live in. </p>

		<p>After seeing this news several days ago, I wrote the Head Start headquarters, but still have received no answer, and really don&rsquo;t expect to. I supposed maybe instead of Santa, whose image is one of love and giving, will watch videos of Somali pirates who only take.</p>

<p>Two would be enough. One women tells her friend that she objects to the celebration of Christmas. The friend agrees. Two friends with the same motivation object.</p>

		<p>We can complain all day about the concessions given out by loony lefties, but eventually we need to ask, what happened to our spine?  </p>
<p>This decision was made by a COWARD. Period.  He was confronted by a &#8220;precious&#8221; protected minority and made the decision based on keeping his job in the name of diversity.  These liberal COWARDS cannot stand up to a crowd.  If the fathers of the children being cheated out of their tradition got together and demanded Santa shows up things could be different.  These things will continue to grow until we start making our own demands.</p>

		<p>The Head Start has no long term effect on academic success of the participating children, just like the Job Corps has no long term effect on employment of their teen trainees. With the amount money wasted on Head Start the issue of Santa is just a minor irritation.</p>
