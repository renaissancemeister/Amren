			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Doughty, Daily Mail (London), December 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Christmas has been banned by the Red Cross from its 430 fund-raising shops.</p>
<p>Staff have been ordered to take down decorations and to remove any other signs of the Christian festival because they could offend Moslems.</p>
<p>The charity&rsquo;s politically-correct move triggered an avalanche of criticism and mockery last night  &mdash;  from Christians and Moslems.</p>
<p>Christine Banks, a volunteer at a Red Cross shop in New Romney, Kent, said: &#8216;We put up a nativity scene in the window and were told to take it out. It seems we can&rsquo;t have anything that means Christmas. We&rsquo;re allowed to have some tinsel but that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>&#8216;When we send cards they have to say season&rsquo;s greetings or best wishes. They must not be linked directly to Christmas.</p>
<p>&#8216;When we asked we were told it is because we must not upset Moslems.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Banks added: &#8216;We have been instructed that we can&rsquo;t say anything about Christmas and we certainly can&rsquo;t have a Christmas tree.</p>
<p>&#8216;I think the policy is offensive to Moslems as well as to us. No reasonable person can object to Christians celebrating Christmas. But we are not supposed to show any sign of Christianity at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Labour peer Lord Ahmed, one of the country&rsquo;s most prominent Moslem politicians, said: &#8216;It is stupid to think Moslems would be offended.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Moslem community has been talking to Christians for the past 1,400 years. The teachings from Islam are that you should respect other faiths.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;In my business all my staff celebrate Christmas and I celebrate with them. It is absolutely not the case that Christmas could damage the Red Cross reputation for neutrality  &mdash;  I think their people have gone a little bit over the top.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The furore is a fresh blow to the image of what was once one of Britain&rsquo;s most respected charities.</p>
<p>The British Red Cross lost friends this year over its support for the French illegal immigrant camp at Sangatte and its insistence on concentrating large efforts on helping asylum seekers.</p>
<p>Yesterday officials at the charity&rsquo;s London HQ confirmed that Christmas is barred from the 430 shops which contributed more than Â£20million to its income last year.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Red Cross is a neutral organisation and we don&rsquo;t want to be aligned with any political party or particular philosophy,&rsquo; a spokesman said.</p>
<p>&#8216;We don&rsquo;t want to be seen as a Christian or Islamic or Jewish organisation because that might compromise our ability to work in conflict situations around the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;In shops people can put up decorations like tinsel or snow which are seasonal. But the guidance is that things representative of Christmas cannot be shown.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Volunteers, however, said they believed the Christmas ban was a product of political correctness of the kind that led Birmingham&rsquo;s leaders to order their city to celebrate &#8216;Winterval&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Rod Thomas, a Plymouth vicar and spokesman for the Reform evangelical grouping in the Church of England, said: &#8216;People who hold seriously to their faith are respected by people of other faiths. They should start calling themselves the Red Splodge. All their efforts will only succeed in alienating most people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Major Charles Heyman, editor of Jane&rsquo;s World Armies, said: &#8216;There is really nothing to hurt the Red Cross in Christmas, is there? Would the Red Crescent stop its staff observing Ramadan?</p>
<p>&#8216;In practice, the role of the Red Cross is to run prisoner- of-war programmes and relief efforts for civilians. Those activities require the agreement of both sides in a conflict in the first place. Celebrating Christmas in a shop in England could hardly upset that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Major Heyman added: &#8216;Moslems are just as sensible about these things as Christians. The Red Cross is just engaging in a bit of political correctness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>British Red Cross leaders have, however, not extended the ban to their own profitable products. Items currently on sale include Christmas cards featuring angels and wise men and Advent calendars with nativity scenes.</p>
<p>The spokesman said: &#8216;The Red Cross is trying to be inclusive and we recognise there are lots of people who want to buy Christmas cards which they know will benefit us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The charity&rsquo;s umbrella body, the Swiss-based International Red Cross, has also had politically-correct doubts about its famous symbol. But efforts to find an alternative were abandoned in the face of protest and ridicule five years ago.<br>

		<p>Is there anyone who still thinks that political correctness isn&rsquo;t a religion in it&rsquo;s own right?  It&rsquo;s laughable and untrue that Moslems in Britain are behind this absurd marginalization of Christmas.  Nope, it&rsquo;s just the usual silly leftists.  Funny, Christmas is controversial in Britain, but a hotel in the United Arab Emirates displays the world&rsquo;s most expensive Christmas tree.  </p>

		<p>This is just stupid.  I know some moslems and they have no problem with christmas and all it entails.  Half of them decorate their houses also with lights and such.</p>
<p>It is PC coming from the white lefties in the organization.  For crying out loud, if they were so concerned about &#8216;offending&rsquo; then they would also change their symbol - the cross.</p>

		<p>The Muslims created the Red Crescent society because they don&rsquo;t want a charitable organization that has a cross.  So the Red Cross responds by banning Christmas.  This is so predictable its would be laughable if it wasn&rsquo;t tragic.<br>

<p>Utterly and absurdly laughable. By instituting this ban, the Red Cross did indeed align itself with a particular philosophy  &mdash;  that of political correctness!</p>

		<p>Jay #3: Absolutely. The Red Cross can now call isteslf the &#8220;Red Star&#8221;, or the &#8220;Red Hammer and Sickle&#8221;. </p>
<p>Drop the Cross, and stop the pretense. You&rsquo;re no more Christian than the Dali Lama.</p>
<p>By the way, the Red Cross is also one of those &#8220;Charities&#8221; that is in favor of Amnesty for 30 million Illegal Aliens, and the DREAM Act in Congress. </p>
<p>Call them and tell them that you will not donate to the Red Cross for their stand on Amnesty. Then call your Congressman and Senators, and tell them to Vote &#8220;NO&#8221; on the DREAM Act.</p>

No, it isn&rsquo;t neutral.  To the contrary, it is anything but neutral.  This, and similar organizations like the YWCA, have been taken over and been made instruments of the Extreme Left.</p>

		<p>  I learned what a greedy self serving organization the RC is when I was in the military. Behind their philanthropic facade, they are all about the bucks. They do what they have to to keep the bucks coming in. I haven&rsquo;t given them a dime or a drop of blood in decades, and never will again.</p>

<p><br>
Ooops! You said &#8220;Christmas&#8221; instead of &#8220;Winterval&#8221;! Now the Red Cross will have to fire its own spokesman for his &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;xenophobia&#8221;! </p>
<p>Folks, this is not your father&rsquo;s Red Cross. Just as the various Humane Societies in western countries   &mdash;   once staffed by kindly grannies in knitted sweaters, now staffed by wild-eyed young radicals in Che T-shirts   &mdash;   so too has the Red Cross been infiltrated by the professional Utopianistas of &#8220;Big Left&#8221;.* Whenever you hear about the Frankfurt School&rsquo;s &#8220;long march through the institutions&#8221; of academe and media, don&rsquo;t forget that the large do-gooder <i>charities</i> traditional in the West (and ONLY in the West) such as Humane Societies and the Red Cross also count as &#8220;institutions&#8221; that need to be &#8220;marched through.&#8221; </p>
<p>The great Anglo-American historian and Sovietologist Robert Conquest once observed that &#8220;Any organization not specifically dedicated to being right-wing, will eventually become left-wing.&#8221; </p>
<p>What exactly do these anti-Christmas policy-makers at the British Red Cross think the &#8220;Cross&#8221; in &#8220;Red Cross&#8221; refers to, anyway? It is the CHRISTIAN cross, the Crucifix, on which Jesus died. Even I know that, and I&rsquo;m an Atheist. But I&rsquo;m an Atheist who completely respects the Christian component in the history of the Red Cross (and Christmas itself, for that matter) and would never dream of forcing them or any other Christ-based org to secularize or de-Christianize itself. </p>
<p>The very idea is insane. Beneath contempt. A bad joke. </p>
<p>Also, are these left-wing kooks who now apparently run the venerable Red Cross not aware that, if Muslims are &#8220;offended&#8221; by a cross or a pine tree with decorations on it, these Mohammed-likers are free to instead join or donate to the charity&rsquo;s Islamic equivalent, The Red Crescent, which operates ambulances, POW camps, etc, throughout the Arab world? </p>
<p>And finally, let me also take a jab at the schizophrenic &#8220;institution&#8221; known as <i>The Daily Mail</i>: a newspaper that prints article after article complaining about the exact same social problems that the British National Party complains about&hellip; and which seems to propose most of the same solutions for those problems as the BNP&hellip; but which then turns around and demonizes the BNP at every opportunity. </p>

		<p>&#8220;We certainly can&rsquo;t have a Christmas tree&#8221;.</p>
<p>I would ask just what part of the Christian religion is symbolized by a Christmas tree or Santa Claus. </p>
<p>Christmas is and has been for many years just about the closest thing to an all inclusive secular holiday. Even Atheist can celebrate Christmas. </p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>When my apartment building in NY burned down (some years ago), the black and Puerto Rican residents were all given an immediate grant (I think it was $300) to buy/replace necessities. However, I (the only white) was bruskly told by the RC investigator (a black man) that the building was still livable (which it was <i>not</i>) and that I was entitled to nothing. He treated me like I was trying to pull some kind of a scam.</p>
<p>I have NEVER given them another dime since, and I never will.</p>
<p>These so-called &#8220;charities&#8221;  (just like government taxation) have become mere devices for taking from whites and giving to non-whites. Another form of wealth transferral!</p>
<p>And thanks to  #1 above for that revelation that the CEO makes over $600,000. a year. With money like that, they don&rsquo;t need my hard-earned pennies.  </p>

		<p>The EU commision has this year sent 3 millions calendars to school children:</p>
<p>&#8220;While the euro calendar marks Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Jewish and Chinese festivities as well as Europe Day and other key EU anniversaries, there are no Christian festivals marked, despite the fact Christianity is Europe&rsquo;s majority religion. </p>
<p>A commission spokesman described the diary as a &#8220;blunder&#8221; and said that in the interests of political correctness there would no references to any religious festivals in future editions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re sorry about it, and we&rsquo;ll correct that in next edition. Religious holidays may not be mentioned at all to avoid any controversy,&#8221; he said.&#8221;</p>

We should start ANOTHER equivalent organization, one that CELEBRATES the cross, and put our money there   &mdash;   and make VERY sure that the people they help are our own U.S. citizens first!!!</p>
