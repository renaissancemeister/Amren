			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Barnes, Washington Post, Dec. 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Supreme Court sounded conflicted Wednesday about whether Arizona&rsquo;s attempt to revoke the licenses of businesses that knowingly employ illegal immigrants intrudes on federal law or complements it. </p>
<p>The case pits Arizona against an unusual coalition of challengers that includes the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, civil rights groups, labor unions and the Obama administration. But that high-powered group faced a barrage of skeptical questions from the court&rsquo;s conservatives, which bodes well for Arizona to see its law upheld. </p>
<p>The state and the law&rsquo;s challengers agree that Congress meant for the 1986 federal Immigration Reform and Control Act to generally preempt states from using employer sanctions to control immigration. But Arizona has taken advantage of a parenthetical clause in the statute  &mdash;  &#8220;other than through licensing and similar laws&#8221;  &mdash;  to go after companies that knowingly hire illegal immigrants. </p>
<p>The law being challenged, the Legal Arizona Workers Act, says a company could lose its business license for knowingly hiring illegal workers  &mdash;  a &#8220;death penalty,&#8221; in the words of Washington lawyer Carter G. Phillips, who represented the Chamber of Commerce. </p>
<p>The legislation was passed in 2007 and signed into law by then-Gov. Janet Napolitano, now President Obama&rsquo;s homeland security secretary. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in the illegal-worker case, though, might give some indication of how willing the justices are to allow states to come up with their own ways of trying to curb illegal immigration. </p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia was the most vocal member of the court in expressing sympathy for the states and suggesting that Arizona was justified in taking what he described as a &#8220;massive step.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;What Arizona says has occurred here is that the scheme in place has not been enforced, and Arizona and other states are in serious trouble financially and for other reasons because of unrestrained immigration,&#8221; Scalia told Phillips. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Acting Solicitor General Neal K. Katyal said there can be no doubt that Congress meant to reserve enforcement of such employer sanctions for the federal government. </p>
<p>But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. sharply questioned why the exception was made for &#8220;licensing and similar laws.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor seemed supportive of the view that the state law intruded on federal responsibilities. </p>
<p>Sotomayor, the only justice who referred to &#8220;undocumented&#8221; rather than &#8220;illegal&#8221; immigrants, asked whether Congress had meant only to give states flexibility on licensing after federal authorities investigated and then decided to sanction an employer. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Justice Elena Kagan withdrew from the case because of her previous work on the issue when she was the U.S. solicitor general. That makes the case even more difficult for challengers of the law. </p>
<p>Because the law was upheld by the 9th Circuit, five of the remaining eight justices would have to agree to overturn the law. A tie vote would uphold the lower court&rsquo;s decision, although it would set no precedent. </p>
<p>The case is Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting. <br>

		<p>Ralph Nader was fond of always calling for the &#8220;corporate death penalty&#8221;.  It was the cornerstone of his Green Party progressive political platform.  I don&rsquo;t need to point out the irony, but it is clear that the left has no problem with yanking business licenses for environmental polluters, companies that violate labor practices, and those that do not pay taxes.     </p>

		<p>The mainstream media&rsquo;s legal beagles are unclear on whether Commerce v Whiting will be any clues to how SCOTUS will rule on US vs AZ on SB 1070 once it gets to them.  I think all that matters is two things:  One, the legal reasoning used in the majority opinion.  (If the majority rules in favor of Arizona/Whiting, and finds no pre-emption, then those same judges will likely also vote to uphold 1070.  If another line of reasoning is used, then it&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;s guess re 1070.)  Two, if we have the same SCOTUS now that we&rsquo;ll have when they take up SB 1070. (You never know who might keel over tomorrow, and guess who gets to appoint the replacement.)</p>

		<p>This will be the most important decision affecting states rights since the 1960&rsquo;s. If the court upholds this law their decision will provide lawmakers in every state with a tool to curb illegal immigration and the theft of American jobs and resources.</p>
<p>I am not surprised that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is on the wrong side of this case. They have long supported giving the jobs of American workers to foreigners. If it&rsquo;s a job that can&rsquo;t be off shored the Chamber wants greedy companies to have the option of having an illegal do it for as close to free as possible. </p>
<p>They say cheap labor is good for the bottom line, and that&rsquo;s good for America.  What&rsquo;s good for America is to have an enormous army of middle class consumers. </p>
<p>This issue is the hidden reason why conservatives are split over raising taxes on the richest people in America. Everybody who has been paying attention is aware that any new jobs resulting from a continuation of the present tax rates will either be in in a developing nation or will be given to an illegal.   </p>

		<p>If the SCOTUS allows this we will see a tidal wave of other states that are buried in immigration costs doing the same thing muy rapido!</p>
<p> This is the best news on the immigration front I&rsquo;ve heard all year. If the undocumented aliens can&rsquo;t find work wages will rise for citizens and the migrants will go to other states. These states will pass similar laws and the migrants will eventually have to go home.</p>
