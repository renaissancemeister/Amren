			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Darryl Dyck, Toronto Star, November 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Failure rates for immigrants writing citizenship tests have soared since the spring, when tougher questions and revamped rules made it harder for newcomers to become Canadian.</p>
<p>The new test, introduced March 15, was based on a bulked-up citizenship guide released a year ago to give immigrants a richer picture of Canada&rsquo;s history, culture, law and politics.</p>
<p>The 63-page guide, Discover Canada, replaced a slimmer volume dating from 1995 that had fewer facts to memorize. The failure rate for the old citizenship test, with questions drawn from the smaller guide, ranged between four and eight per cent.</p>
<p>Failure rates for the new test, however, rocketed to about 30 per cent when it was first introduced  &mdash;  prompting officials to revise the rules to avoid clogging the system with thousands of would-be Canadians who, because they had flunked, often had to plead their cases before busy citizenship judges.</p>
<p>A reworked test introduced Oct. 14 is helping to cut the national failure rate to about 20 per cent, still far higher than historic levels and making the exam-hall experience much more nerve-wracking for newcomers.</p>
<p>Hundred of documents outlining the bumpy introduction of the new tests were obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the highest number of fails I have seen in my time here with CIC (Citizenship and Immigration Canada) doing the test,&#8221; said a harried official at a Mississauga, Ont., office on March 19 this year, where 15 of 43 people had failed that day.</p>
<p>The old and new tests both have 20 multiple-choice questions and a 30-minute time limit. Only those citizenship wannabes aged 18 to 54 years are required to write the test, which is available in French and English.</p>
<p>But the pass mark for the test introduced March 15 was set at 75 per cent, meaning at least 15 of the 20 answers had to be correct. That compares with just 60 per cent, or 12 right answers, for the old exam.</p>
<p>The impact of the tough new standards was dramatic: shocked officials at testing centres across the country reported massive failure rates in the first sittings.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&rsquo;t believe it, it&rsquo;s the highest fail rate I have ever seen here,&#8221; one Toronto-area official reported by email to headquarters.</p>
<p>An internal survey of 35 testing centres across Canada, carried out between April 19 and June 24, showed an average of one in four people were flunking. At some centres  &mdash;  such as the busy Etobicoke office in Toronto  &mdash;  it was one in three.</p>
<p>And while many people under the previous regime finished the test within 15 minutes, the new exam had most people sweating for the full half-hour.</p>
<p>People who failed the old test were automatically referred to a citizenship judge. In 2008-2009, for example, 9,500 applicants who blew the test had to spend up to an hour with a judge to argue they were still worthy of citizenship.</p>
<p>Worried that the tougher tests could swamp the system, officials decided that applicants who flunked would be allowed to rewrite. And in the revamped test introduced Oct. 14, the department further eased the rules by eliminating a long-standing policy requiring correct answers to a few mandatory questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We anticipate that the pass rate will settle in the 80 per cent to 85 per cent range, which would indicate that the test is not too easy or too difficult,&#8221; said department spokeswoman Karen Shadd.</p>
<p>She added that the test questions are being shuffled more often to help end what the department believes was rampant cheating under the old system.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past, with the old test, some people would buy the answers from unofficial sources,&#8221; Shadd said in an email.</p>
<p>&#8220;After paying for the answers, they would memorize them in order to pass the test. This accounted, in part, for a much higher pass rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shadd also said the option of rewriting the test is only a temporary measure implemented to deal with the transition to the new exam.</p>
<p>She declined to provide an example of the test but said typical questions are either fact-based  &mdash;  &#8220;Name two Canadian symbols&#8221;  &mdash;  or conceptual, such as &#8220;What is the meaning of the Remembrance Day poppy?&#8221; Sample questions are included in Discover Canada.</p>
<p>The internal survey of 35 testing centres in late spring found the Etobicoke office in Toronto had the highest failure rate at 34.9 per cent, followed closely by Surrey, B.C. (33.7), Winnipeg (31.5), Scarborough in eastern Toronto (31.3) and Niagara Falls, Ont. (30.4). Officials declined to speculate on why these were the worst performers, but said education levels rather than mother tongue appear to be a big factor.</p>
<p>Citizenship and Immigration administers about 150,000 citizenship tests each year. The current 75 per cent pass mark is the same as in Australia and the United Kingdom, but higher than the 60 per cent set by the United States.</p>
<p>Shadd would not say how the new tests have increased the department&rsquo;s workload, only that &#8220;there were times of heavier than normal workloads during the most intensive monitoring phase when we initially implemented the new test.&#8221;<br>

		<p>What makes the difference what the third world hordes know or don&rsquo;t know about Canada?  Most of them are going to be jihadsists or black criminals, and all of them are there to freeload on the system.</p>
<p>I just read where Canada is experience more crime now than ever before in the large urban centers.  It couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer bunch of do-gooders.</p>

		<p>In the past, the function of a test was to assess how much a person knew.  </p>
<p>Today the function of tests is to assure that a certain percentage of people of color pass.  Test difficulty is adjusted until the desired political result is achieved.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Lower Education Level&rsquo; does not equal less dedicated study habits.  Lower IQ does.</p>
<p>None of which matters because an honest society does not try to raise productivity by introducing competitive alien exogroup TFRs which force the middle class of their own ethnies to breed down to compensate for drastically lowered professional class wages.</p>
<p>The reality being that if X won&rsquo;t breed with Y because Y is stupid or ugly or introducing bad social mores, then X&rsquo;s cut of the pie is going to be smaller because Y&rsquo;s will _never_ be assimilated back into their own.</p>
<p>Do you people see what the &#8216;answer&rsquo; to that question is?  That&rsquo;s right, forced miscegenation.</p>
<p>When Nature proves tougher than propaganda, the whips will come out and your kid will be _required_ to marry someone of another race.  First through tax penalties backed up by &#8216;scientific analysis&rsquo; related to hybrid vigor (and ignoring hybrid slump) making for stronger workers or some such.</p>
<p>And finally through the old tried and true public denunciation of &#8216;racism&rsquo; as the equivalent of peer pressure: &#8220;We all did it, don&rsquo;t make us feel bad by staying true to your bloodline and remaining smarter than we now are!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then it will flat out become a crime.  Not for our benefit but to protect the elites who don&rsquo;t need any more people breaching their IQ range from below.</p>
<p>And NONE of this makes sense because the capitalist system metric it is centered on will collapse long before it makes the elites the last possible penny from the last possible wage slave.</p>
<p>Indeed, at the rate we are trying to lever up the world to our social benefits level (consumerism, the basis of all profit and indenturement), it will have to because the resources will run out at about the same time as the populations of the &#8216;host countries&rsquo; refuse to participate in their own denigration for the benefit of &#8216;others&rsquo; two or three classes above and below them.</p>
<p>SOMEONE needs to take the lead and close their borders.  SOMEONE needs to say that capitalism doesn&rsquo;t work.  Democracy doesn&rsquo;t work.  Ignoring the realities of genetics driven IQ doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And that nation has to be rich and ethnically homogenous enough to survive the resulting cry of jealous outrage from other states.</p>
<p>Guess who the ONLY nation groups that this &#8216;us first, last and always&rsquo; attitude mostly falls upon?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.  The Middle East.  And Northeast Asia.</p>
<p>People whose social cruelty and religious hypocrisy we currently despise.</p>
<p>It makes _no sense_ that their evil should inherit our wind.</p>
