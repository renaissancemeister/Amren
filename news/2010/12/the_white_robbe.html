			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), December 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A white man who pleaded guilty to six robberies in Ohio used a black mask so lifelike that police initially arrested a black man for one of the crimes.</p>
<p>The mother of the wrongly accused man even thought a photo of the robbery suspect she saw on television was a photo of her son.</p>
<p>Conrad Zdzierak, 30, pleaded guilty Monday in Hamilton County Ohio to one count of aggravated robbery and five counts of robbery in a plea deal with prosecutors.</p>
<p>He faces up to 35 years in prison at his January 7 sentencing.</p>
<p>In exchange, prosecutors dismissed 12 charges and decided not to seek indictments for other crimes, prosecutor spokeswoman Julie Wilson said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Conrad apologises to everyone, is sorry for any harm he has caused and accepts responsibility for his actions,&rsquo; his lawyer Christopher McDowell said.</p>
<p>Zdzierak stole about $15,000 in the robberies of four banks, a credit union and a pharmacy that occurred in March and April  &mdash;  crimes in which witnesses reported that the robber was black and surveillance video appeared to show a black man.</p>
<p>Zdzierak&rsquo;s masked resemblance to the black man who was initially arrested was so similar that some witnesses even identified a photo of the black man as the one who robbed them, McDowell said.</p>
<p>The prosecutor&rsquo;s office would not release the name of the wrongly accused man.</p>
<p>Zdzierak was arrested at a hotel after his girlfriend called police after seeing reports of the robberies and finding two masks and money stained by dye that is used to track robbers, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported.</p>
<p>McDowell said his client purchased the masks from SPFXmasks, based in Van Nuys, California. The silicone masks &#8216;look and behave like real flesh and muscle,&rsquo; the company&rsquo;s website says.</p>
<p>Owner Rusty Slusser said Tuesday his company&rsquo;s masks are normally bought for movies, Halloween, haunted houses and stage shows, but the Ohio case was not the first time they have been used for criminal purposes.</p>
<p>&#8216;We do not condone any illegal activity with our masks,&rsquo; Slusser said.<br>

<p>He&rsquo;ll probably get life for defaming the black race.</p>
<p><i> The mother of the wrongly accused man even thought a photo of the robbery suspect she saw on television was a photo of her son.</i></p>
<p>But whites are called racist if we say they all look alike.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a chance this will be made into a media and educational event like &#8216;to kill a mockingbird&rsquo;. Anything to distract from the one million personal acts of crime or violence committed by blacks against whites in the USA each year. Not to mention the hundreds of bank robberies that take place every year in Ohio.</p>

<p>I think that during the 1930&rsquo;s in Detroit there was a group called the Black Legion. White men wearing robes, hoods, masks, gloves, posing as black men to commit crimes? A dozen or so whitey getting away with things for a while. There is precedent for this! This is the something like the man bites dog news story? </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve simply got to get one of these masks.  As a fluent ebonics speaker I could embark on a life of crime and never be caught.</p>

		<p>I hope this white boy (he should choose his girl frieds more carefully) can fight. Once those bucks smell that white booty and learn he wronged one of their own he may be dressing in drag. If he likes disguises how about a blonde wig and dressing him up as Lady Ga Ga. </p>
<p>That is a sad statement as to what our penal system has become. No pun intended. I feel sorry for this guy but to ad the racial element to this was really thoughtless. Where are you going son if you get caught? Answer: Prison and who is in prison? Blacks. </p>

		<p>For a long time, there were Immigration Controls in place which would have prevented &#8216;Conrad Zdzierak&rsquo; from being in America in the first place.</p>
<p>This story definitely falls under the heading &#8220;What They&rsquo;re Counting as White, These Days&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Clearly, this is one of those instances in which it&rsquo;s okay for media to mention the race of the criminal. </p>
<p>Too bad that isn&rsquo;t standard practice. </p>
