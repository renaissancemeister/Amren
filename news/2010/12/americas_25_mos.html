	<p>Where in America are people most likely to be murdered, raped, robbed or have their car stolen?</p>
<p>A new list, based on police reports, says that one Chicago neighborhood  &mdash;  around West Lake Street  &mdash;  is the most dangerous in America, but also notes that Atlanta is home to four of the 25 worst neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Other hot spots include parts of Las Vegas, Cleveland and Memphis, Tenn.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>NeighborhoodScout.com takes crime data from the FBI and from all 17,000 local law enforcement agencies in the U.S., and sorts it to pinpoint events to the 61,000 neighborhoods in America, based on ZIP code. {snip}<br>

		<p>Every time I read a story like this the 1970&rsquo;s disco song &#8220;Funky Town&#8221; comes to mind. It was a Pied Piper tune, performed by coal burners, that was designed to lead White girls to the hood. It always amazed me that there are so many White kids who will read statistics about violent crime in Black neighborhoods and get turned on by it.</p>

		<p>We all know that these 25 neighborhoods contain a lot of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and since liberals claim that they  love &#8216;diversity&rsquo; perhaps they wouldn&rsquo;t mind moving to these places. I&rsquo;m sure money wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue since real estate prices in these neighborhoods is no doubt cheap. So, how &#8216;bout it liberals?! Bill and Hillary? Chris Matthews? Anyone from the Kennedy clan? George Soros? Rachel Maddow? Nancy Pelosi? Harry Reid? C&rsquo;mon guys, be a sport! Dan Rather? Michael Moore? Mark Potok? Katie Couric?&hellip;</p>

		<p> The article carefully avoids identifying any neighborhood by the ethnic majority living in it. But looking over the geographic spread of the list   &mdash;   Northeast, South, urban Midwest, Southwest   &mdash;   leaves no doubt that the &#8220;bad&#8221; &#8216;hoods are mostly black, with a heavy leaven of Hispanic in Nevada.</p>
<p> Why don&rsquo;t we see more articles in the media like this? It would be a public service to know just which areas to avoid. But I suppose the NAACP would be all over such publications, shouting &#8220;Racist!&#8221; and &#8220;Racial profiling!&#8221; The powers that be in this country don&rsquo;t like to see a spade, called a spade. </p>

		<p>Atlanta, being a maj. afrovoodoo city, proves the purpose of the civil rights movement- make White Humanity as miserable as possible, and never criticized blacks in front of Whites.</p>
<p>Rep. John Lewis likes to give speeches about how mean Whites were to MLK and Emmett Till, but we never see him on local news demanding that &#8220;his&#8221; black community come together to report criminal behavior to the police, or warning the Atlanta&rsquo;s White Community to protect itself from his roaming blacks.</p>
<p>We are fast approaching our Day of Racial Reckoning, after which, thank God of Holy Whiteness, nothing will ever again be the same.   The Iron Laws of Nature can be subverted for only so long, and the Equality/Diversity racket is a violation that will not be tolerated by White Justice.</p>
<p>Transcend Diversity, Embrace Whiteness, Teach Your White Children About Their White Ancestors, Demand Michael King Fake Reverend&rsquo;s FBI File Be Opened for Public Inspection and Critique!</p>
<p>Whites Will Reclaim Our Republic!  Send the blacks back to Africa where our White God wants them to be.  Voodoo beckons, so let it have them all. </p>

		<p>I am a graduate student living near Detroit.  One thing I am shocked and appalled by is my region not being represented on this list.  I find it hard to believe that not one zip code in Detroit made in onto the top 25.  Maybe there are just looking for new places to rag on (like Las Vegas).  My guess would be that Detroit is not on there based solely on the fact that most crimes are never solved in Detroit (I think we solve about 10-11% of all murders that are REPORTED).  But that is just one of the many different and creative crimes to come out of the &#8220;D&#8221;.  Anyways, I&rsquo;m not sure if I should be happy or mad that they are trying to sweep it under the rug.</p>
<p>For all of you out there that live close or in these zip codes, be safe.  I know I will.</p>

		<p>60612 is my office zip code. I have worked here for the past 11 years, in a government office. We have (armed) security in our parking lot and at the front door of our building. The area has actually improved some from past years, the prostitution is less obvious. I have carried (legally) a loaded firearm every day here for the past 11 years. </p>

<p>It is interesting that Chicago is number one.  That is where our President began as a Community Activists.</p>
<p>Now if a guy can&rsquo;t control his own neighborhood, why would you elect him President?  </p>
<p>You might as well elect the President of Haiti President of the USA.  </p>
<p>I would like to see all the self hating white people that got Obama elected bussed into these neighborhoods and force to stay there until they publicly confessed their sin of  hatred for the white race or the residents there put them out of their misery.<br>

		<p>According the leftists, who seem to tell rank and file americans everything they hear, this is all more a reason to celebrate their cultures and get in special touch with them, and them in touch with and celebrating themselves. It&rsquo;s not a coicidence white crime and misbehavior have skyrocketed since the 1960s too?</p>

		<p>I recently went back to my old neighborhood in Queens to visit a friend whose getting his house in order so he can sell it. We went to the Home Depot and I saw a whole bunch of Mexicans in the parking lot, something I hadn&rsquo;t seen even when we left due to all the Indo-Caribbeans who stunk the place up. Now apparently even those are complaining. So wait a few years and maybe your town or neighborhood can make this list. The same pattern I saw when we left Brooklyn so many years ago. Cypress Hills 1965: mostly white, safe place to live. The same 1975: dubbed murder capital of the city for that year. The difference: White Racism, of course.</p>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.  Your information source(s) is flawed.  The have been 32 homicides in the ENTIRE STATE of Utah this year.  </p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/37sxtkk" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/37sxtkk</a></p>
<p>Compare that to the 2010 body counts of these major U.S. cities:</p>
<p>New York-476&hellip;.Chicago-416&hellip;.Philadelphia-282&hellip;.Los Angeles-257&hellip;.Baltimore-204&hellip;.New Orleans-159&hellip;..St. Louis-128&hellip;..Washington-118</p>
<p>Also, look at the cities with population 100,000-250,000 section on the link below, and you will see where SLC ranks.</p>

		<p>Salt Lake is less white than most Utah since its now about 25 percent Hispanic but still it doesn&rsquo;t make sense about the crime rate,maybe a lot of outsiders come because its the Mormon capital. Still prefer Salt Lake to the Texas cities even Austin which is more white but will probably become more Hispanic in the future as the Mexican population in Texas and California discover Austin. Also, Irvine, Mission Viejo have the lowest crime in Ca and are white/asian and MV only about 16 percent Mexican.</p>

The Mormons, like most Christians, try to live out their beliefs.  Unfortunately, the Mormons welcomed too many mexicans to SLC.  In a discussion with a vendor located in SLC in 1995, I just happened to mention that being in SLC must be great, no crime.  She responded to me, not any more, the mexican gangs have moved in.  I was shocked at this since I was planning on moving my family out of Florida to a safer state.  After that revelation, I began to research the FBI&rsquo;s Uniform Crime Statistics Report.  Studying these reports as well as other data, I determined that many of the formerly all white regions of the country were being &#8220;diversified&#8221; and the crime in those regions was taking large jumps upwards.  Even further research proved to me that this recasting of our country was intentional.  From private foundations and charities settling minorities in all white regions to the federal government conducting the same with refugees and immigrants, particularly illegal immigrants.  All of us, mainly Christians, have been taken for a ride, one that will end in the destruction of America and probably great harm and death to us and our descendants.  </p>

		<p>How can Oakland or Richmond, California not be on the list? I suppose it is something to do with &#8220;neighborhood&#8221; vs. &#8220;city.&#8221; The resulting list is misleading, then.<br>
 <br>
I didn&rsquo;t realize that Las Vegas had several awful neighborhoods. You would think with all the money that city has, measures would be taken to dissuade certain people from living there.<br>
          <br>
Why were they afraid to include the demographics? Let me guess  &mdash;  no one would publish the study if race were included because it would show that the worst neighborhoods were Black or illegal Hispanics, and showing that would be deemed racist.</p>
