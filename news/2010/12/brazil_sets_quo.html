<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-latinamerica/20101229/LT.Brazil.Black.Diplomats/">Brazil Sets Quota for Black Diplomatic Students</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Comcast News, December 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Brazil&rsquo;s government wants the people in its embassies to look a little more like the people on its streets. So the nation with a slight black majority is giving black applicants a push at the nation&rsquo;s diplomatic academy.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry says Wednesday that starting in 2011, at least 10 percent of the 300 applicants who pass an initial stage of testing for the academy must be black.</p>

		<p>Nothing new here.  Our country has long pushed for non-white males in the diplomatic corp.  Sometimes it&rsquo;s funny to see an &#8216;american&rsquo; ambassador from the &#8216;hood having a high level meeting with foreign bigwigs who look clearly annoyed and bemused.</p>

<p>Brazil is by no means a total disaster like Africa or the Caribbean keep in mind Brazil has around 100 million &#8220;white&#8221; (more or less, often less) people so just because blacks and mullatos have a majority there are enough functional citizens to keep the economy afloat and the street violence somewhat contained.  </p>
<p>Even a small white minority can keep a black country afloat as demonstrated by Rhodesia and apartheid south Africa afloat as long as you can keep the corrupt black despots out of political power.</p>

		<p>First, Brazil is not majority black. <br>
Second, Brazil is quickly gaining steam as a world power economically.<br>
I&rsquo;m not defending their quota system, but as the United States unravels culturally and financially, countries like Brazil could easily step into the vacuum created and become a hemispheric powerhouse.<br>
And white people still control Brazil completely, and that&rsquo;s not going to change anytime soon. </p>

		<p>@Anonymous, Post #1.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an easy question to answer. Just take a look at the parts of the country that have large White populations, such as Sao Paolo, and see the difference between the wealthy south of Brazil and the impoverished north and interior.</p>

		<p>&#8216;With its vast geographical size and natural resources, Brazil<br>
should be an economic powerhouse&rsquo;. It is. For example, according to the IMF, Brazil gdp using exchange rate will be over two trillion USA dollars at the end of the year,<br>
 the same size as Italy and larger than Russia,<br>
a country with  vast geographical size and natural<br>
resources. Brazil gdp will surpass Italy in 2011, according<br>
to the IMF and the Economist. The president of Brazil<br>
expects the country to be the 5th largest economy by 2016. Using purchasing power parity to measure gdp, its gdp is larger<br>
than Italy, France and the UK.</p>

		<p>It might hurt their tourist industry if people are going to the embassies to apply for a visa and they see alot of black faces.  Of course, I would pick Buenos Aires over Rio De Janiero without any hesitation but maybe some Western tourists want something more &#8220;exotic&#8221;, not that many of their countries aren&rsquo;t filled with enough of them already.</p>

		<p>RE: #1 anonymous  &mdash;  I think that Brazil may be better postured for economic powerhouse status  than we are in the US. Of course all bets are off once they get up to our speed with all of this EEOC disparate impact business.  </p>
<p>Also, it is very important to read the entire original article. 16 passers out of 200 scholarships?? And the law schools and bar exam writers here in this country think they&rsquo;ve got it tough??!!</p>

		<p>Ah, Brazil just elected a white-hating, former Marxist-Leninst Revolutionary guerrilla by the name of Dilma Rousseff.  The woman idolizes Fidel Castro, Hello, do we really need to say anything more about the future of Brazil.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been to Brazil a couple of times, and many of the &#8220;whites&#8221; there would not be considered white in the US due to a significant portion of African ancestry.</p>
