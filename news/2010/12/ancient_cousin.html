<h1>Ancient Cousin of Humans Identified by Scientists</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>London Telegraph, December 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>DNA taken from the 30,000 year old finger bone of a young girl was found to be neither from early human nor Neanderthal, and was from a previously unknown species, now called Denisovan.</p>
<p>The bone, along with a tooth fragment, was discovered in the Denisova cave in southern Siberia, and its DNA was found to be distinct from human or Neanderthal.</p>
<p>Researchers say that like Neanderthals, Denisovans interbred with early humans, and traces of their DNA can be found in modern day Melanesians  &mdash;  those from the islands around Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Scientists say they would have inhabited land across Asia, only to become extinct alongside the Neanderthals as early humans thrived.</p>
<p>The bone was found in 2008 by Russians, and examined by a team led by Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.</p>
<p>They compared the Denisovan genome sequence to the recently unravelled Neanderthal genome, as well as to modern humans.</p>
<p>Denisovans were found to be a sister group to Neanderthals, and had descended from the same ancestors who split from the ancestors of modern humans.</p>
<p>Scientists had known that Neanderthals and early humans had interbred, as there is Neanderthal DNA in all non-African humans.</p>
<p>But they found that Denisovans also interbred with humans  &mdash;  and traces of their genes are found in modern-day Melanesians, suggesting the cavemen travelled widely across Asia, reports Nature.</p>
<p>Professor Richard Green of the University of California, Santa Cruz, said: &#8220;The story now gets a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of the clean story we used to have of modern humans migrating out of Africa and replacing Neanderthals, we now see these very intertwined story lines with more players and more interactions than we knew of before.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was fortuitous that this discovery came quickly on the heels of the Neanderthal genome, because we already had the team assembled and ready to do another similar analysis.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an incredibly well-preserved sample, so it was a joy to work with data this nice.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t know all the reasons why, but it is almost miraculous how well-preserved the DNA is.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that the Denisovans were &#8220;quite different both genetically and morphologically from Neanderthals and modern humans&#8221;, with the tooth similar to those of much older human ancestors, such as homo erectus.</p>
<p>It was unclear why the species had not been discovered before  &mdash;  but Prof Green said that because both the bone and the tooth, which came from different members of the same population, resembled those of earlier humans other finds may have been overlooked.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;It could be that other samples are misclassified.</p>
<p>&#8220;But now, by analysing DNA, we can say more definitively what they are.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s getting easier technically to do this, and it&rsquo;s a great new way to extract information from fossil remains.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prof Green said the evidence now suggests that an ancestral group of early humans left Africa up to 400,000 years ago and diverged, with one branch heading to Europe and becoming the Neanderthals and a second moving east and becoming Denisovans.</p>
<p>When modern humans left Africa  &mdash;  some 80,000 years ago  &mdash;  they came into contact with first the Neanderthals before another group interbred with Denisovans, the traces of which now exist in Melanesia.</p>
<p>Prof Green said: &#8220;This study fills in some of the details, but we would like to know much more about the Denisovans and their interactions with human populations.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you have to wonder if there were other populations that remain to be discovered. Is there a fourth player in this story?&#8221;<br>

		<p>These remarkable discoveries are being made all the time. The fragmentary evidence can now be analyzed by DNA sampling and some startling conclusions drawn.</p>
<p>This group the Denisovans was new to me. Had never heard of them before.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m so proud to be of European ancestry. Those Neanderthal genes have given us an edge in intelligence, problem solving and long-term planning.  Now, if I could just do something about the hair on my back.</p>

		<p>Can some one with better knowledge tell us all,when man first walked out of Africa=those that are described as Neanderthal, those that are described as European man, now the Denisove man=did they walk out as White men leaving their Black relatives behind,or did they too walk out as Black men then collectively suddenly go white. curious.</p>

		<p>It would be interesting to know what Human Genetic Research<br>
is going on, what the findings are. I suspect that there is<br>
an inclination to suppress some research and findings that<br>
contradict Globalist Egalitarian Values (PC) and which contradict the heavily promoted &#8220;out of Africa with Eve Theory&#8221;. Its possible non PC research may occur in Asia and not in Western Universities under &#8220;PC Lockdown&#8221;.</p>

		<p>innocent bystander,</p>
<p>they probably walked out as Africans, but developed different markers as the new environment made pressure on them. For e.g., mutations happened in northern populations of Europeans and Asians towards a pale skin, but each of these groups has different mutation, although the skin color is rather similar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of Africa, with Benefits&rdquo;</p>
<p>Posted By Steve Sailer On 22 December 2010 </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s that big new science story I teased a couple of days ago. By Carl Zimmer in the New York Times:</p>
<p>An international team of scientists has identified a previously shadowy human group known as the Denisovans as cousins to Neanderthals who lived in Asia from roughly 400,000 to 50,000 years ago and interbred with the ancestors of today&rsquo;s inhabitants of New Guinea.</p>
<p>All the Denisovans have left behind are a broken finger bone and a wisdom tooth in a Siberian cave. But the scientists have succeeded in extracting the entire genome of the Denisovans from these scant remains. An analysis of this ancient DNA, published on Wednesday in Nature, reveals that the genomes of people from New Guinea contain 4.8 percent Denisovan DNA.</p>
<p>An earlier, incomplete analysis of Denisovan DNA had placed the group as more distant from both Neanderthals and humans. On the basis of the new findings, the scientists propose that the ancestors of Neanderthals and Denisovans emerged from Africa half a million years ago. The Neanderthals spread westward, settling in the Near East and Europe. The Denisovans headed east. Some 50,000 years ago, they interbred with humans expanding from Africa along the coast of South Asia, bequeathing some of their DNA to them.  &hellip;</p>
<p>Next, the researchers looked for evidence of interbreeding. Nick Patterson, a Broad Institute geneticist, compared the Denisovan genome to the complete genomes of five people, from South Africa, Nigeria, China, France and Papua New Guinea. To his astonishment, a sizable chunk of the Denisova genome resembled parts of the New Guinea DNA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The correct reaction when you get a surprising result is, &lsquo;What am I doing wrong?&rsquo; &rdquo; said Dr. Patterson. To see if the result was an error, he and his colleagues sequenced the genomes of seven more people, including another individual from New Guinea and one from the neighboring island of Bougainville. But even in the new analysis, the Denisovan DNA still turned up in the New Guinea and Bougainville genomes. &hellip;</p>
<p>Dr. Bustamante also thinks that other cases of interbreeding are yet to be discovered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of possibility out there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But the only way to get at them is to sequence more of these ancient genomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the genomes of New Guineans come almost 5% from non-modern humans, then the obvious next step is to test the genomes of Australian Aborigines, who are last in line in the original Southern, Indian Ocean shoreline route Out of Africa. However, there are a lot of regulatory barriers against testing Aborigines, perhaps out of fear that scientists will find something like this. After all, Aborigines look a little archaic, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be terribly surprising if their genes turn out to be a little archaic.</p>
<p>It was lucky that the first findings of non-modern human ancestry involved Europeans, or it would have been hard to get up the political courage to publish this.</p>

		<p>Amazing new discovery.   I remember when I was taking physical anthropology a few new discoveries happened (this was a &#8220;pleasure&#8221; course as it is a facinating subject) during the class.</p>
<p>I have always felt Neandertals and Cro-Magnon &#8220;inter breed&#8221;, and was gld I was finally proved right for my own theories.  This new discovery adds more questions to the puzzle.   </p>
<p>Who knows what this find will reveal&hellip;</p>

		<p>I know less than others contributing to this discussion  as<br>
far as the question marks hanging over a whole-hog Out of Africa<br>
theory.  However, my impression is that a larger scientific issue arises over this OoA question.  That is the issue of undue<br>
&#8220;Eureka&#8221; passions within science (passions so intimately linked to academic careerism).  It seems in current retrospective that there&rsquo;s always been so very much looming darkness over what we think we have discovered re OoA  that within the tiny sphere of knowledge, a bubble-world consistency of apparent evidence now loosens in the wake of more recent factual light??? Roger Pearson is one anthroplogist who long  tried to place some needed qeustion marks over whole-hog OoA theory.   I have so far found no indication that the multi-regional &#8220;bone&#8221; people have every anywhere entered into a public adacemic  discussion/ disputation/ with OoA adherents?   The impression is that these groups, the bone people being a small number, do not speak with each other??? Bubble world &#8220;Eureka errors&#8221; need to be punctured as soon as possible. Relevant here?  </p>

		<p>WASHINGTON (AFP) – A US study found that Neanderthals, prehistoric cousins of humans, ate grains and vegetables as well as meat, cooking them over fire in the same way homo sapiens did.</p>
<p>The new research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) challenges a prevailing theory that Neanderthals&rsquo; over reliance on meat contributed to their extinction around 30,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Researchers found grains from numerous plants, including a type of wild grass, as well as traces of roots and tubers, trapped in plaque buildup on fossilized Neanderthal teeth unearthed in northern Europe and Iraq.</p>
<p>Many of the particles &#8220;had undergone physical changes that matched experimentally-cooked starch grains, suggesting that Neanderthals controlled fire much like early modern humans,&#8221; PNAS said in a statement.</p>
<p>Stone artifacts have not provided evidence that Neanderthals used tools to grind plants, suggesting they did not practice agriculture, but the new research indicates they cooked and prepared plants for eating, it said.</p>
<p>The squat, low-browed Neanderthals lived in parts of Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East for around 170,000 years but all evidence of them disappears some 28,000 years ago, their last known refuge being Gibraltar.</p>
<p>Why they died out is a matter of debate, because they co-existed alongside modern man.</p>
<p>The latest study was carried out by the Department of Anthropology at the Smithsonian natural history museum in Washington.</p>

		<p>While I am glad to see stories about human origins that get us closer to the truth, I still find it a little odd that scientists are claiming there was another species of human about which we weren&rsquo;t previously aware of, based on a knuckle bone and a tooth.</p>
