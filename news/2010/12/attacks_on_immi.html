<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/world/europe/01greece.html?_r=1">Attacks on Immigrants on the Rise in Greece</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Niki Kitsantonis, New York Times, December 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A wave of violent attacks against immigrants by suspected right-wing extremists has put Muslims and the police on alert in rundown parts of Athens with burgeoning migrant populations.</p>
<p>Immigrants have been beaten and stabbed near central squares, and several makeshift mosques have been burned and vandalized. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tensions in neglected, crime-ridden parts of Athens with growing immigrant communities have been mounting over the past two years. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thanassis Kokkalakis, a police spokesman, said the problem was complex. He said that while &#8220;extremist elements&#8221; were believed to be behind certain attacks, there was also violence between migrants of different ethnic origins, muggings of Greeks by poverty-stricken foreigners and clashes between extreme rightists and left-wing protesters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The attacks in Greece mirror similar incidents in other European countries, including Switzerland, where a referendum last November led to a ban on the construction of minarets on mosques, and in France and Italy, where the authorities have deported Roma residents and immigrants.</p>

		<p>To understand this, Americans have to know some facts about Greek.</p>
<p>Greek was former the half of Turkey. And Cyprus was Greek. Then the Turks killed and drive off the Greeks. After that they started a war in Cyprus and divided the country. So Greeks were killed and driven off.<br>
And now the nearly same people who once killed them try to get into their country - still hating them but wanting their welfare.</p>
<p>And since Greek is in big financial problems and the invading Turks and Arabs don&rsquo;t behave much better than Mexicans in America, Greeks now want to stop this. They use their right of having their own country.</p>

		<p>When the economic pie as a whole was expanding, people were tolerant as there was plenty for all.  Live and let live.  Now that there is no growth, or worse contraction, and there is civil unrest.  People are unhappy and are not as tolerant.  <br>
The productive can no longer support the unproductive, and the social benefits to the unproductive will diminish sharply.  Neither group is happy as expectations are not being met and soon food and fuel will be at a premium.  <br>
For Greece, in the recent past a culture of public demonstrations resulted in improved payouts from the government.  But those payouts were financed with debt.  Human capital was not developed.  The economy did not grow from organic sources but rather external debt. Now the financial markets, correctly fearing non-payment, have make Greek debt very expensive-to-not-available.  <br>
The economic system by itself cannot support the governmental largesse.  All Greeks will see their standard of living decline.  The people are angry and will throw rocks.  Little can be done other than defer that day of reckoning when the debt comes due.  The Ponzi scheme has collapsed, there is no way out, only delay.  Expect civil unrest and actions along class lines.  It is the way of history.  </p>

<p>This breathtakingly dishonest. Leftist double-speak at its worst.</p>
<p>So, stabbing people is &#8220;similar&#8221; to democratically voting agsinst minarets, or lawfully deporting immigrants with a 300 â‚¬ gratuity, perfectly knowing that they will come back one week later to collect yet another &#8220;gift&#8221; from the people of France.</p>

		<p>Greece knows what Islam is really like. The Ottoman Turks<br>
once occupied the country and when not massacring Christians<br>
or carrying them off as Janissary slaves were busy blowing holes<br>
in the Acropolis. Greece isnt going to let it happen again.<br>

		<p>Over the years I have come to know several members of Australia&rsquo;s large Greek community. Many of them still alive can remember the turmoil their nation has gone through in recent times. They have had to put up with Nazis, monarchists, communists, dictators and more recently the generals. They have had to put up with poverty and contant threat from Turkey.Then there were the more or less forced population transfers of Greeks from Turkish controlled islands and the Turkish Adriatic coast right up until the 1970s. Yet through all of this Greeks have been able to retain their national identity as well as successfully intergrate wherever they have emmigrated to.</p>
<p>In view of all of the above I can fully understand Greek reluctance to have both their identity and their fragile economy threatened by an influx of third worlders. And like Australians, most Greeks that I know are not frightened to speak their mind on all of these things. Perhaps the Greeks will speak out loud enough to raise awaremess of the present EU 3rd world immigration insanity. (And if Turkey joins the EU, that is almost 100 million Muslims with automatic right of entry to Europe including Greece, its a worry)</p>

		<p>I wonder if this Niki Kitsantonis from &#8220;The New York Times&#8221; is aware that attacks on Whites in every White country in the world by these &#8220;immigrants&#8221; is on the rise and that attacks on Christians in Muslim countries is also on the rise.

		<p>Outside the anti-immigration circles there&rsquo;s one trends analyst in particular who has been correct on most ALL of his economic, social and military evaluations, and he was saying 3 years ago that a backlash of anti-immigration movements will lead the way to stop immigration throughout the West, especially Europe.</p>
<p>Looks like he&rsquo;s right once again.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The day after the protests, government officials said a stalled project to build an official mosque was back on track. Athens is the only capital of the original 15 E.U. member states to lack a state-approved mosque.&#8221;<br>
________</p>
<p>So these governments are in the business of building mosques for muslims? And then they wonder why there is anger in these countries and it ain&rsquo;t all coming from supposed &#8220;rightwing extremists&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Most Turks are ethnically whole or part Greek, as the Seljuks who invaded centuries ago were a minority and they just turkicized Anatolia over the centuries.</p>
<p>I wonder how immigrants from Africa and elsewhere even think to go to Greece instead of other Euro-zone countries.  Greece has always been poor, and the land is not exactly bursting with opportunity.</p>

		<p>I am Greek, and though I have lived abroad for the past few years I visit Athens and follow the news and discuss with my friends and relatives. I can tell you for sure this article is an inversion of reality. Greeks are afraid to walk around large parts of the city even during daytime. Athens is basically ruined. This happened in the span of 10 years, I remember that in the early 2000s there were almost no problems like this. If you go to certain areas now you have to remove all jewelery, precious items etc, otherwise you are mugged. The right-wing extremists the article talks about are practically non-existent, and the few that exist generally understand the score and are careful not to give the popular media fuel for their propaganda via pointless violence. The violence of the natives against the ILLEGAL immigrant is very sporadic, and absolutely miniscule compared to the attacks originating from the illegals against the Greeks. Just to give you an idea, of the 12 thousand prisoners in greek jails, 7 thousand are foreigners, many illegal. And no, these jailed people are not Swiss or Belgian or Polish. All third world immigrants and Albanians.</p>

		<p>It would seem that anti Muslim, White Nationalism should be an easy sell in Greece. </p>
<p>The Greeks can simply present the question:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we want to be enslaved by the Muslim Turks again&#8221;?</p>
<p>Most Greeks would say &#8220;no&#8221;.</p>
<p>(I am of course leaving out the 1% of Greek Libertarian true believers who insist that race and culture are social constructs and open borders immigration from the Turkish/Muslim world is &#8220;good for Greece&#8221; the same way these Libertarian kooks insist that open borders immigration is &#8220;good for America&#8221;)</p>

		<p>The southern european states have long been part of a human pipeline that shifted migrants north to the wealthy north european states. As long as the migrants were just passing through the authorities had no real reason to stop them and deprieve the local human smuggling cottage industry of income and themselves of bribes. </p>
<p>Now the flow is very much bigger and the northen euro states are more and more difficult to get into which means there is an overspill of migrants into the local community. If the greeks had taken action in the 70s and 80s and dissolved the smuggling networks the current situation would not have happened. But alas, as always, the short sighted perspective prevailed. </p>
<p>Southern Europe is much more warm and friendly to homeless/semihomed living than northen Europe where General Winter has resumed his annual offensives. That means there is a much bigger potential for shantytowns and similar constructs, something the greeks (and italians, and the french, and the spaniards etc) will soon discover. </p>

Yes, it&rsquo;s strange how the controlled media insists on presenting an inversion of actual reality. I remember reading how communist intellectuals wanted art to represent &ldquo;what should be&rdquo;, not unpleasant realities. In fact, it was a crime to tell the truth in the Soviet Union. Communism is a system based on the lie, Western liberal democracy (Cold War victor) has become its old enemy.  </p>

<p>Really? To my eyes Turkish and Greek people look rather different from one another. Even their builds appear different to me. Turkic people are a biracial entity. Some look mongolid while others look caucasoid and the rest somewhere in between. I suspect the seljuks were of the caucasoid variety as they traveled westward into anatolia followed by waves of mostly caucasoid-looking turks. Central Asia was originally populated by caucasoids (and still is) before the expansion and arrival of mongolid nomads. </p>

<p>Albanians are Europeans too and they&rsquo;re Greeks&rsquo; northern neighbors. Perhaps the crimes committed by these &#8216;illegals&rsquo; are of an economic and/or sociocultural nature? Biological makeup alone doesn&rsquo;t make one a criminal (not that that&rsquo;s what you were insinuating).<br>

		<p>To poster 14: Jon<br>
I&rsquo;ll have to agree with Jay. I think you might be confusing the &#8220;Turkic&#8221; people with the &#8220;Turkish&#8221; people. The Turkic race can be found from the Anatolian peninsula to the Western provinces of China, and fit your description of a &#8220;biracial entity&#8221;.<br>
As to the Turkic people from Turkey (The Turkish), you&rsquo;ll find that almost all of them look Caucasian (though not necessarily White).<br>
I do find however, that it is quite hard to tell Greeks and the more European looking Turks apart, though of course Poster 10, being Greek himself may have less trouble.<br>
Also, the Seljuks, were Caucasoid, but most likely originated in Iran, as Persian was the language in which they kept records.</p>

		<p>After what the Turks did to the Greeks in the past, its no wonder Greek people aren&rsquo;t very fond of Moslem immigrants.  Neither are the Germans, or so I&rsquo;ve heard.  My liberal German aunt has a saying, &#8220;Where the Turk treads, no grass will grow.&#8221;  And she&rsquo;s a liberal, mind you.  But seriously, the Turks occupied Greek land for centuries, turned the magnificent Hagia Sohpia, once the largest church in the world, into a mosque, massacred hundreds of thousands of Greeks and Armenians during World War I, still occupy large swaths of formerly-Greek land, and on top of all that had the audacity to invade Cyprus and greedily snatch half of it for their own selves.  Of course, violence is not the answer.  But the Greek people must wake up, and I think they will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The attacks in Greece mirror similar incidents in other European countries, including Switzerland, where a referendum last November led to a ban on the construction of minarets on mosques, and in France and Italy, where the authorities have deported Roma residents and immigrants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Poster #3 pointed out, you can&rsquo;t compare violence and murder to democratic elections and lawful deportations.  It just makes the writer of the article seem a bit stupid.</p>

<p>No, there was no confusion there in my choice of words. When I wrote &#8220;Turkish&#8221; I really meant the people of turkey. </p>
<p>&#8220;Turkic&#8221; is an umbrella term to describe the various peoples across the Euro-Asian continent with linguistic similarities.<br>
  <br>
The Greeks and Turkish (yes from Turkey) I&rsquo;ve observed in person looked rather different even though they&rsquo;re both caucasians. Of course, there is bound to be some overlap between the two groups due to historic interaction. But still the facial differences were there. </p>
<p>Perhaps Greek and Turkish people reading this could chime in.</p>

<p>ItÂ´s the border. The Turkish/Greek border is currently EuropeÂ´s weakest link. (Spain and Italy used to be in the same situation, but they have actually managed to get much better control over their borders, partly by cooperating with certain African nations)</p>
<p>Having entered Greece, itÂ´s easy for the asylum seekers/illegals to travel to other and richer European countries, and many do, especially those who intend to apply for asylum, but they will frequently be returned to Greece by force. To avoid being returned asylum seekers will frequently remove their fingerprints as to fool the system.</p>
<p>(For the momenet several European countries have stopped returning them to Greece anyway, due to some human rights concern.)</p>
<p>Like poster #12 mentioned, for those who donÂ´t qualify for asylum but will stay as illegals, Southern Europe is in general friendlier than Northern Europe, both because of warmer weather and because Southern Europe has a larger &#8220;black economy&#8221; so itÂ´s easier to work illegaly there than in the better regulated and controlled job market in Northern Europe.</p>

		<p>Not to worry. On Friday Dec 3 the Establishment BBC announced with great fanfare on the 6 O&rsquo;clock News that an EU Immigration <br>
Task Force has been set up to police the Greco-Turkish border to prevent illegal immigramts entering from Turkey to Greece. These EU Marxists/globalists &amp; the BBC are fooling no-one as to put this force in place now when for decades Greece has been flooded with illegal immigrants most passing through to other European nations is an obvious sick joke. This &#8220;Task Force&#8221; is strictly &#8220;window-dressing&#8221; by the EU authorities who are worried sick about the rise in nationalism in all European nations.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Just to give you an idea, of the 12 thousand prisoners in Greek jails, 7 thousand are foreigners, many illegal. And no, these jailed people are not Swiss or Belgian or Polish. All third world immigrants and Albanians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I personally haven&rsquo;t had much experience with Albanians, but I went to school with a lady from Serbia who had nothing positive to say about them. I&rsquo;m not sure what levels of productivity would be expected from a group of Croats, or Serbs, or Slovenes in a free society. But left to their own devices, the Albanians would create a society that is slightly more advanced than sub-Saharan Africa.  </p>
<p>According to this woman, the Albanians who lived in former Yugoslavia tended to have very large families (10 or more kids), lived in horribly overcrowded hovels, and performed poorly at school. When they could gain affirmative action reservations at the Universities, they would invariably major in physical education since just about every other subject was beyond their capacity to grasp. She told me a story of one girl from her middle school who was sold by her parents at age 12 to a 40 yo man so that the parents could obtain the money to open a candy store (some small ventures were allowed in Yugoslavia). Even though the Albanians were poor by the Serb standards (and this was under communism), when people from Albania would visit, they thought of Serbia as the land of &#8220;Milk and Honey&#8221;. </p>

<p>Entirely believable.  I&rsquo;m sure that to them, it is.</p>
<p>When I was in Morocco, some years ago, at a time when Spain was still one of the poorest countries in Europe, I was amazed to find that the Moroccans thought of Spain as a land of RICHES! <br>
 <br>
And so it was   &mdash;   by THEIR  standards.  To a North African, ANY part of Europe was rich. </p>
