<h1>Remarks About Mexico Spark Bar Brawl, Beating</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Beatriz Valenzuela, Daily Press (Victorville, Calif.), Dec. 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
<p><font color="#000000"><span style="text-decoration: none;"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">Two
men accused of beating a man even after the victim stopped fighting
back are scheduled to be arraigned after the holidays, according to
court documents.</span></span></font></p>
<p>Jose Moran, 43, of Hesperia and David Aguirre Jr., 30, of
Montebello were arrested Monday for assault with a deadly weapon
after they beat, stomped, choked and at one point tried to strike the
victim with a barstool at the Marina Lounge, all because the
attackers felt the victim made a disparaging remark about Mexico,
according to San Bernardino County Sheriff&rsquo;s Victor Valley station
officials said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At about 1:45 a.m. Monday, authorities received several 911 calls
about a fight inside the Marina Lounge located in the 13200 block of
Spring Valley Lake Parkway.</p>
<p>Deputies learned all three men became involved in a brawl after a
comment was allegedly made by the victim.</p>
<p>Moran and Aguirre reportedly pounced on the man and continued to
beat and choke him until other patrons became involved and stopped
the fight.</p>
<p>The victim was treated and soon after released.</p>

		<p>How many times in my life I have heard Mexicans make disparaging remarks about white people.  No one said anything.  I feel it is because we are tougher minded.  Our ancestors could not have created the greatest country in the world if they were politically correct softies.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s unfair of the USA to seduce Mexico&rsquo;s bravest patriots across the border with promises of $7/hr landscaping careers and free medical care.</p>
<p>It just isn&rsquo;t fair to the great nation of Mexico.</p>

		<p>These arrogant hispanics are attacking us and then wondering why more and more we don&rsquo;t have any sympathy for them.  Since they (like many blacks) hate us and wish us ill no matter what, might as we say and do the things we believe in when it comes to issues of race and politics.  If you&rsquo;re going to be persecuted no matter what, might as well make it worth your wild.</p>

		<p>I left Victorville in 1999 when the diversity factor went sour. In the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s it was a sleepy desert community that had been almost exclusively white and crime free, today it has a huge mexican/black population, the schools are out of control, and the crime is as bad as Los Angeles. <br>
  Welcome to the future.</p>

		<p>The nationalism that infects latinos is way off the charts of what we westerners are used to.  </p>
<p>The way they wave their flags, brawl for their nations&rsquo; &#8216;honor&rsquo; and wax poetic with the mere mention of their countries is something to be experienced.  It&rsquo;s difficult to just describe with words.</p>
<p>Some &#8216;white&rsquo; groups like Italians are also fanatical sometimes, and drunken british soccer fans are boorish.  However, groups like that tend not to pull guns and try and kill you for innocent remarks about their countries.</p>
<p>We all lump the latinos into one big category, but among them the rivalries are terrific in proportion.  The three groups I have seen who are the most nationalistic are Mexicans, Dominicans and Puerto Ricans.</p>
<p>What do they have to be so proud about?  Their nations are third world pits of backwardness.  But even the crips and the bloods celebrate their &#8216;hoods.&rsquo;  It&rsquo;s natural to wave a banner of adoration for one&rsquo;s own.  Some latinos just take it to an extreme.</p>

		<p>We need to ask ourselves what is the cause of Latin America&rsquo;s corruption and failure. Is it Geography or weather?  The truth is the geography and weather are much more conducive to wealth production and successful government than North America is.  It is the people who populate Hispanic Nations that cause failure.  When they hold the majority here, this nation will be exactly like Mexico and points South, corrupt failures.    </p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it richly ironic that these super-patriots who love their country so fanatically are HERE instead of THERE?</p>
<p>No matter what they say about how wonderful the old country is, they are saying the opposite with their feet. I hear their feet.</p>

<p>So, Mexicans are starting to beat up white Americans in America, for not talking nice about a country they voluntarily departed. </p>
<p>And no doubt a reporter with such a traditionally American, &#8220;Mayflower&#8221;-type name as <i>Beatriz Valenzuela</i> can be trusted to give us a fair, factual, unbiased, diligently researched and fact-checked account of any Anglo-v-Hispanic confrontation. </p>
<p>Always remember to check the reporters&rsquo; bylines, folks. Very often, the writer&rsquo;s name will tell you everything you need to know about what they write. </p>

		<p>@7 JvB,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Is it Geography or weather?<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Actually, the weather has a _lot_ to do with how whites turned out.  It&rsquo;s just that it happened when there were likely fewer than 100 million of us, total, on the planet and so there was a lot more space and a lot less social dependence -as access- to &#8216;shared&rsquo; resources.</p>
<p>Cold isolates.  Cold kills bacteria and keeps disease from becoming as prevalent or as widespread.  Cold Wet Snow makes life easier in the spring when the earth is rich and damp enough, thanks to the fall detritus, to plant two and three crops a year.  The Cold drove predators into smaller numbers and gave advantage to herd animals that could share warmth and snow-penetration, walking in each others prints.</p>
<p>The Cold also abides no fools who pretend to be grasshoppers when it is time to work _together_, like mad little ants, preparing for a bad season.  The Cold rewards those who do work hard by giving them free time and good cultural maintenance (the one thing Christianity may have been good for was maintaining histories of Greek and Roman architecture and engineering), again thanks to a season where labor was constrained and warfare impossible.  The result being technologies, production commerce, the Arts and simple Printing.  All of which required people to get along together, something The Cold mandated via stern consequences to breaking cultural precepts of hospitality and what you had to do to maintain it as civil, polite, group behavior.</p>
<p>The Cold is our friend in ways we never imagined.</p>
<p>But all that was 50,000 years ago.  Our ancestors bent their wills as our epigenetic legacy gift.</p>
<p>And with 7 billion on the planet, there is no time left to bring blacks, hispanics and other &#8216;warm climate cultures&rsquo; to our level of knowledge and understanding.  It is likely, without extreme genetic modification that their genetic inheritance will drive their behaviors to our civilizations&rsquo; if not species, endgame.  </p>
<p>With sheer exuberance of numbers and hot blooded &#8216;warmth&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Frost was wrong-</p>
<p>  Some say the world will end in fire,<br>
Some say in ice.<br>
From what I&rsquo;ve tasted of desire<br>
I hold with those who favor fire.<br>
But if it had to perish twice,<br>
I think I know enough of hate<br>
To say that for destruction ice<br>
Is also great<br>
And would suffice. </p>
<p>An extended period of true cold, and the snows that go with, while hard, would ultimately favor whites.  Reforge our social bonds. </p>
