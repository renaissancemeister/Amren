<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>China has strengthened its economic and political ties in Africa in recent years in an effort to open up new markets and secure much-needed raw materials. The leaked US diplomatic cables reveal that Africans are growing increasingly resentful of China&rsquo;s aims and methods.</p>
<p>The young worker had had enough. He was fed up with all the accidents, all the broken promises, the anger of the supervisors and, lastly, the pay raises that were pledged but which never came. So, in mid-October, Vincent Chengele, 20, and some of his fellow coal miners gathered in front of the Collum Coal Mine in southern Zambia. Before long, there were a number of miners protesting against their bosses  &mdash;  Chinese investors who had bought the mine in 2003.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, shots rang out as Chinese overseers began firing wildly into the crowd. Chengele and 10 other miners fell to the ground injured.</p>
<p>A wave of outrage went through Zambia. Even President Rupiah Banda, who usually supported Chinese investment in his country, condemned the violent response. Elijah Muchima, a minister in Southern Province where the mine is located, complained that Zambians were &#8220;being treated like animals.&#8221; He criticized how the workers were paid as day laborers rather than being given contracts, and condemned their &#8220;slave salaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the first time there had been conflict with the Chinese. The mine had already been closed on several occasions due to dangerous conditions. In 2006, some brusque Chinese foremen simply refused to allow the Zambian minister responsible for mining to enter the complex. </p>
<p>And allowing the Chinese in Zambia to have weapons would also appear to be a bad idea: According to the Tanzanian English-language daily The Citizen, a Chinese foreman fired upon striking workers at a copper mine in Zambia a few months ago. The paper reported that some people were even comparing the Chinese to &#8220;Africa&rsquo;s former colonial masters.&#8221;</p>
<p></b>Hungry for Markets and Materials</b></p>
<p>China is currently more active in Africa than any other foreign power. Chinese President Hu Jintao has already visited 20 African countries, and the Chinese premier and foreign minister have also made regular visits to the continent. Likewise, ministerial-level meetings between African and Chinese officials are frequently held  &mdash;  and are popular with the Africans because they often return home with new contracts in their pockets. In 2009 alone, Chinese companies invested roughly $56.5 billion (â‚¬41.3 billion) in Africa.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Chinese government and private Chinese companies have signed hundreds of contracts with African partners. China has extended loans worth billions and sent thousands of workers to Africa, which is now home to almost a million Chinese. They have built hundreds of hospitals and thousands of kilometers of roads, as well as government buildings, railway lines and football stadiums.</p>
<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for this aid, many African countries would be significantly worse off than they currently are. China, the manufacturing giant, needs Africa as a market for its goods. But, even more importantly, it needs Africa in order to satisfy its need for raw materials. And the Chinese have a thirst for all kinds of natural resources, including gold, wood, copper, coal, oil and coltan.</p>
<p><b>Growing Resentment</b></p>
<p>American diplomats posted in Africa keep a very close eye on the activities of the world&rsquo;s only other major power. Indeed, they send very detailed reports to Washington from almost all of the countries in Africa. But the leaked dispatches don&rsquo;t only include information about the skyrocketing growth in trade. They also discuss the growing resentment among Africans toward the Chinese. Naturally the whole discussion revolves around issues such as power on the continent, security interests and spheres of influence. And often billions of dollars are at stake.</p>
<p>For example, international observers were astonished at the end of 2007 when the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo reached a comprehensive deal worth over $9.2 billion with Beijing. The agreement guaranteed China mining rights that will help it secure 10 million tons of copper and 620,000 tons of cobalt.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Sino-Congolese agreement immediately raised concerns among both multilateral and bilateral donors regarding the loan-agreements on the Democratic Republic of Congo&rsquo;s debt sustainability,&#8221; is how one dispatch from American diplomats later described it. Congo already owed billions of dollars to the World Bank and other Western creditors, so a new contract with China would make it more difficult for them to secure payments on either the interest or the principal of their loans. </p>
<p>At a later point, William Garvelink, America&rsquo;s ambassador to Congo, wrote: &#8220;Throughout 2008 and the first half of 2009, neither the Chinese nor the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo indicated any real willingness to revise the agreement to ensure compatibility with debt sustainability.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dispatches coming out of the US Embassy in the Congolese capital Kinshasa provide rare insights into the worlds of international finance and development policy. For example, in May 2009, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), came to Kinshasa. &#8220;While the visit was ostensibly to discuss the impact of the global financial crisis on a number of African countries, in reality, however, it was used to push the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo to take the necessary political steps to engage the Chinese on renegotiating the Sino-Congolese agreement,&#8221; reads one cable.</p>
<p>Eventually, Western pressure had an effect, and Congolese President Joseph Kabila caved in. The agreement was trimmed down by about a third.</p>
<p><b>Old Friends, New Partners </b></p>
<p>Beijing has long had close relations with a number of African states. For example, Cameroon has been considered an ally since 1971, partly because of its government&rsquo;s early decision to support China&rsquo;s hard line against Taiwan. In return, the Chinese constructed a hydro-electric power station in Lagdo, built hospitals and roads, sent doctors to the country and trained Cameroonian officer cadets in China.</p>
<p>The Chinese are also extremely active in Angola. After the country&rsquo;s civil war ended in 2002, Western donors were hesitant at first and were only willing to grant loans with tough conditions attached. But Beijing jumped right in. China&rsquo;s Eximbank extended a loan worth over $4 billion and reportedly issued another one soon thereafter. At least one of the loans includes a condition requiring Angola&rsquo;s government to grant major contracts to Chinese companies.</p>
<p>The Chinese also built four new football stadiums for the Angolans  &mdash;  in Luanda, Benguela, Lubango and Cabinda  &mdash;  which hosted the games of the 2010 Africa Cup tournament in January. They have spent millions to help repair the famous Benguela railway line. And they also plan to build a new international airport in Luanda, the Angolan capital.</p>
<p><b>Partners Who Don&rsquo;t Ask Questions</b></p>
<p>The Chinese are also welcomed as partners in Africa because they don&rsquo;t ask too many questions or set stringent conditions. They do without all the demands the West likes to set as preconditions for receiving aid, such as good governance, respecting human rights and decisive anti-corruption efforts.</p>
<p>The Chinese take a different approach. No matter whether it&rsquo;s war in Darfur, repression in Zimbabwe or corruption in Nigeria  &mdash;  for the Chinese, it&rsquo;s not their problem. For example, instead of taking Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe to task for his totalitarian policies and looting of his own country, they bestowed an honorary doctorate on him in 2005 and declared him &#8220;China&rsquo;s No. 1 Friend.&#8221; Three years later, in 2008, they sent Mugabe the An Yue Jiang, a ship full of weapons and ammunition.</p>
<p>In fact, many politicians throughout Africa have grown to appreciate the fact that China doesn&rsquo;t impose conditions or ask questions. They also value how it grants lines of credit, builds parliamentary buildings and supplies arms without any hassle.</p>
<p><b>Access to Internal Documents</b></p>
<p>For example, Kenya, concerned about simmering political tension with its eastern neighbor Somalia, obtained some military hardware from China. But Beijing provided Kenya&rsquo;s National Security Intelligence Service (NSIS) with much more than just computer and telecommunications equipment. Indeed, the scope of the Chinese involvement ultimately grew so large that the worried US Embassy in Nairobi reported in a secret dispatch to Washington that: &#8220;As of September 2008, (Chinese telecommunications equipment company) ZTE was building e-Government infrastructure on the NSIS headquarters compound. The project involved a secure network for Kenyan e-Government activities.&#8221; Since then, the Americans have been forced to assume that Chinese intelligence officers have access to much of the Kenyan government&rsquo;s internal documents and communications.</p>
<p>Beijing even nurtures ties with a failed state like Somalia. For example, China was one of the first countries to lend support to the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in Mogadishu when it started work in October 2004. A year later, China would sign a number of trade agreements with Somalia&rsquo;s government. &#8220;We understand that China made additional periodic cash contributions to President Yusuf,&#8221; wrote diplomats from the US Embassy in Kenya in one cable, referring to Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, the former head of the TGF. &#8220;Our contacts told us that the support was always in cash payments and that most of it was disbursed within the TFG cabinet.&#8221; </p>
<p>According to US diplomats, the Somali ambassador to Kenya admitted that: &#8220;China is not concerned with politics, only economics, and is positioning itself for commercial advantages in post-conflict Somalia.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Failed to Create Jobs&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite the abundant help provided by the Chinese, the American cables reveal that criticism of China is growing in many African countries. For example, in many regions, the Chinese are viewed as being responsible for smuggling, poaching and overfishing. They are also accused of ignoring labor laws and of flooding the continent with counterfeit brand-name products.</p>
<p>For example, the US Embassy in Nairobi wrote that &#8220;the Kenya Wildlife Service noticed a marked increase in poaching wherever Chinese labor camps were located.&#8221; The wildlife service also apparently reported that &#8220;90 percent of the ivory smugglers detained at JKIA (Jomo Kenyatta International Airport) are Chinese nationals.&#8221; The US embassies in Cameroon, Zimbabwe and Nigeria also filed reports about Chinese ivory traders and went so far as to claim that some Chinese diplomats were involved in the smuggling efforts.</p>
<p>Similarly, Chinese investors in Angola have drawn much criticism despite all the aid they have provided. For example, one report from the US Embassy in Luanda claims that there were concerns that &#8220;Chinese engagement, financed by loans that Angola needs to repay, has failed to create jobs for Angolans, has failed to transfer technology to Angolans, and has often resulted in poor quality performance.&#8221; There were also concerns about a lack of transparency regarding funding for projects, which were handled by an office of the president.</p>
<p>Reports coming out of the US Embassy in Abuja, Nigeria, weren&rsquo;t much prettier. &#8220;International press reports claim that some Nigerian officials are concerned about the Chinese practice of importing Chinese workers who could exacerbate local resentment, particularly in the Niger Delta where there are major grievances over the lack of employment opportunities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Above all, the report added, cheap Chinese textile imports had already destroyed the domestic industry, forcing more than 65 factories to close over the last 10 years. According to the document, the sector&rsquo;s decline had affected over a million Nigerians who made their livelihood from the textile industry, whether as cotton workers, factory hands or salespeople. </p>
<p><b>&#8216;Huge Problem&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>In fact, the changes reportedly prompted the head of Nigeria&rsquo;s retail trade union to voice bitter complaints to American diplomats. &#8220;The Chinese are here and that is a huge problem,&#8221; he apparently said. &#8220;The Chinese have no respect for local laws . &nbsp; &nbsp; and they compromise a lot of things, including safety.&#8221; The man went on to complain that, while corruption is punished in China with the death penalty, Chinese people working abroad were quick to adjust to the laxer habits of their surroundings.</p>
<p>For example, within a one-week period in October 2007 alone, Tanzanian authorities in the port of Dar es Salaam seized 73 cargo containers with tropical softwoods that were bound for China. One cable from the US Embassy in Dar es Salaam bluntly states that the Tanzanian government&rsquo;s 2004 ban on the exports of logs &#8220;is widely seen as ineffective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reports from the US Embassy in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, strike a similar tone. &#8220;Officially, bilateral trade between China and Mozambique was approximately $200 million in 2006,&#8221; reads one cable. &#8220;It may have been worth much more than this  &mdash;  Chinese fishing vessels (and others) are thought to be pillaging the marine fishery off Mozambique&rsquo;s coast and Chinese businesses are believed to be heavily involved in illegally logging of Mozambican hardwoods.&#8221; Embassy officials added that they believed &#8220;Chinese assistance comes with strings attached.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Guantanamo in Niger</b></p>
<p>The Chinese are apparently equally relaxed when it comes to health and safety regulations in the workplace. In Zambia, coal miners are sent underground half-naked and barefoot. In Niger and Zambia, workers mine uranium without any protective clothing and are housed in camps near the mines, with the result that they are constantly exposed to high levels of radiation.</p>
<p>The Tuareg people living in the area near the new SOMINA mine in northern Niger have even nicknamed the workers&rsquo; encampment there &#8220;Guantanamo,&#8221; because of the harsh working conditions and the Chinese foremen. And, in Namibia, the Chinese allegedly told complaining workers that they had to &#8220;suffer now, so that future generations can enjoy.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The idea that, as a group, Chinese would ever be friendly toward blacks is simply an example of liberal magical thinking.  Only whites as a group are ever friendly to blacks.  But whites will always be blamed for whatever goes wrong.  Whites are the best thing that have ever happened to blacks.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the least bit surprising. Communist China backed Mugabe and the ZANU throughout the Rhodesian Bush war.</p>

		<p>East Asians move in where white people move out.  &#8220;&#8216;The Chinese have no respect for local laws and they compromise a lot of things, including safety.&rsquo; The man went on to complain that, while corruption is punished in China with the death penalty, Chinese people working abroad were quick to adjust to the laxer habits of their surroundings.&#8221; Exactly.  East Asians always take advantage of situations.  East Asians discover the inner workings of a system and plunder it like the Press Your Luck contestant Michael Larson who figured out the Whammy pattern.  Remember the Chinese aligned themselves with anti-Western elements in Africa decades ago to remove white people from the continent.  Like all non-white people East Asians are envious and resentful of white people.  I want to know what activities the Chinese are doing in all white-created countries from Australia to Estonia.  Don&rsquo;t think the Chinese are only doing nefarious things with Africans.  Most white people will ignore stories like this because it isn&rsquo;t dramatic and personal like an eight year old being raped.  White people have ignored countless toxic products coming from China from drywall to children&rsquo;s necklaces.  These large issues of foreign elements undermining white people should be focused more on.</p>

		<p>During Africa&rsquo;s &#8220;wars for liberation&#8221;, the African guerilla groups happily took money from the Chinese regime; who told the Africans that they, too, were a nonwhite people who suffered at the hands of Western &#8220;hegemony&#8221;.  The Africans ate it up.</p>
<p>As long as the Africans held their hands out for gifts from the Chinese, there were no problems. The Chinese asked no questions, and cared nothing for the atrocities committed by African despots. Compare that attitude to whites like Susan Sarandon, wringing her hands over Bantu women being raped by Bantu men in Darfur.</p>
<p>The Chinese have probably built more structures in sub-Sahara Africa in the few years they&rsquo;ve been there, than Africa&rsquo;s entire Bantu population combined. Yet, NOW the Africans are complaining because the Chinese business owners won&rsquo;t give Bantus jobs for free. The Chinese aren&rsquo;t stupid. Virtually all African Bantus do not speak or understand Han Chinese, and tend to be unskilled laborers; so why shouldn&rsquo;t the Chinese fill these jobs with Chinese nationals.</p>
<p>I note that the Africans complained to &#8220;dat ole white debbil&#8221; America. It seems some now don&rsquo;t like &#8220;dat yella debbil&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s also ironic that many cotton-pickers in Nigeria were forced out of their jobs when the Chinese textile merchants set up shop. Didn&rsquo;t we fight a war in America, over black cotton-pickers some 150 years ago?</p>
<p>So the Chinese are stripping Africa of their raw materials? Good! The Bantus leveled the same charge against Western colonialists. That&rsquo;s why they were being &#8220;held back&#8221;, they claimed.</p>
<p>The Bantu nations made a bargain with the &#8220;yella debbil&#8221;. Now, they must take the consequences. I hope the USA doesn&rsquo;t get involved in this Sino-Bantu situation, since China owns much of our debt. If the Bantus think their &#8220;soul brutha&#8221; Obama will come to their rescue, then they&rsquo;re delusional like they smoked jenkem or yohimbe.</p>
<p>Maybe white rock stars will join together to provide a massive &#8220;concert for Africa&#8221;, after the Chinese strip the continent of its resources. They did it before, with Ethiopia.</p>
<p>What is now happening in Bantu Africa with the Chinese, is what many posters at Amren, SAID WOULD HAPPEN. I love it! </p>

Who didn&rsquo;t see this coming?</p>
<p>Take a high achieving, industrious people and pair them with the low achieving, layabouts and what do you expect?</p>
<p>Add into the mix the fact that the Chinese have no connection to the history of African slavery and &#8216;racism&rsquo; and the Chinese can&rsquo;t be browbeaten into uplifting Africans. </p>
<p>The Chinese likely believe they&rsquo;re helping African by providing them with jobs and infrastructure. Africans only see themselves as the eternal victim.</p>

		<p>Every culture that encounters real Africans reacts the same, natural way- with disgust.</p>
<p>Read Hinton Rowan Helper&rsquo;s Africans in Africaland.  If the Chinese are harsh in Africa, my esteem for China just went up. They are race realists.  Every one of their successes only holds up our failures in stark contrast, i.e. importing Africans, African immigration, integration, Affirmative Action, Diversity, Interfaith with Voodoo, etc unto utter disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Chinese have no respect for local laws and they compromise a lot of things, including safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure the Conquistadors respected the laws of the Aztecs and Incas, and I&rsquo;m sure safety was a primary consideration when the Suez Canal was built by the British&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. East Asians always take advantage of situations. East Asians discover the inner workings of a system and plunder it like the Press Your Luck contestant Michael Larson who figured out the Whammy pattern.&#8221;</p>
<p>And White people didn&rsquo;t take &#8220;advantage of the system&#8221; when they imported opium into China to cover their trade deficit during the 19th century? They didn&rsquo;t take advantage of the naievete of African tribes by obtaining innumerable concessions and slaves for the price of a few pieecs of glass? Montezuma&rsquo;s Treasury and the Chinese Summer Palace, were these not places looted by Whites? What makes Whites so different from Asians?</p>
<p><br>
We have here an example of hypocrisy at its finest. Europeans did all these &#8220;race realist&#8221; things in the past, yet when the Chinese do it, you label them as &#8220;EVIL!&#8221; But when WHITES do similar things, I&rsquo;m sure that you (and I&rsquo;m referring to Poster 3 here) would be the first to profess that it was all &#8220;for their own good&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Personally, I like the Chinese and have had many friends from there. I don&rsquo;t much like blacks overall and have no blacks I would call friends because I know that in a black crowd, they would NOT be my friend any longer but just another black thug and me the honkie&hellip;seen it before.</p>

		<p>When China rules the world, this is how China will treat EVERYONE. The Middle Kingdom, half way between heaven and earth, China, inhabited by humans, all the rest being barbarians.</p>
<p>If you are a dark skinned person reading this and hoping for the day that whitey no longer is the boss of the planet, well, just wait and see what occurs when the Chinese begin to tell you what to do. </p>
<p>And no sass or backtalk either. Just try burning their flag and see what happens.</p>

		<p>Well, it didn&rsquo;t take very long for the Sino-African encounter, dialogue and cooperative effort to go south, did it? If they&rsquo;re already &#8220;firing wildly into crowds&#8221; and &#8220;forcing them down mine shafts half naked and shoe-less&#8221; then it won&rsquo;t be long before the natives rise up mau mau or Belgian Congo style (I wonder who will bankroll &#8216;em in this effort).<br>
     The Chinese will exploit the land, resources and people mercilessly and continuously; like vampires they&rsquo;ll leave nothing behind but a dry husk or a depleted vessel. They&rsquo;ll even take all of the wildlife and botanicals for their medieval &#8220;medicines.&#8221; Sorry Africans, you won&rsquo;t stand a chance; because the Chinese are not encumbered with delusions of equality or shared humanity. No,they know your IQs are very low, and theirs are very high, so they tower above you as Mount Everest above the swamp. Sorry, that&rsquo;s just the way it&rsquo;s gonna&rsquo; be.   </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s really a situation ripe for rampant exploitation, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Take a highly intelligent people, the Chinese, who as a people seem motivated by nothing less than as much rapacious profit-taking as possible and present them with a continent rich in natural resources owned by a less intelligent population, still struggling to enter modernity, rife with corruption and incompetence, that is utterly incapable of bargaining to the benefit of the population at large.</p>
<p>The Chinese will strip Africa bare like a cloud of locusts.</p>
<p>Well, at least Europe will be off the hook!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Chinese who migrate to western countries would necessarily treat us a great deal better once they were to get to a position to do so. In my dealings with Chinese the signs are already there. The arrogance, the looking down upon those of a perceived lower wealth status, the keeping dealings amongst themselves wherever possible, it&rsquo;s here in some form already. Just because they supposedly have high IQ&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t feature predominately in crime statistics doesn&rsquo;t mean they have the interests of Whites at heart, which one could often infer from comments even here. I can easily imagine the above taking place in a western country in 20-30 years if immigration trends continue, just with less intense bullying as whites are not so easily corralled and would probably truly hit a &#8220;wake-up&#8221; point at that time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Similarly, Chinese investors in Angola have drawn much criticism despite all the aid they have provided.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
Hey China, welcome to &#8220;the white man&rsquo;s burden&#8221;. The yellow man will soon learn the same thing the white man did in centuries past: the more you do for the black man, the more he will resent you. And that the only way to &#8220;get along&#8221; with the black man is, ironically, to have NO CONTACT with him at all. </p>
<p>The difference of course is that the yellow will feel no such &#8220;burden&#8221; and his rapacity will not be tempered by any Western-style altruism or misguided sentimentality. African workers go on strike? Chinese bosses fire them <i>en masse</i>. African miners riot? Chinese troops break out the hardware slaughter them <i>en masse</i>. </p>
<p>Eventually, this pattern will become so commonplace, so predictable, that even the locals with their average IQ of 70 will be able to figure out that their new <i>bwana</i> means business; and will tolerate NONE of their nonsense. Even the dumbest villager in the most backward village will eventually come to understand that resistance is futile. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it on here before and I&rsquo;ll probably go to my grave saying it: before the Chinese are done with Africa, the Bantus will be issuing formal apologies to the Boers and begging the British to come back. The PLA is on course to turn the entire planet into &#8220;China Inc.&#8221; and that &#8220;company&rsquo;s&#8221; dirty, dank, dangerous basement will be Africa. </p>
<p>So black man, you didn&rsquo;t want to work for the white man? Well now you&rsquo;ll be SLAVING for the yellow man. FOREVER. </p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer bunch of people. </p>

<p>I believe you&rsquo;re missing the point.</p>
<p>If whites exploited and took advantage of Africans (and the Chinese) as you say, then Africans have simply substituted one exploiting master for another. </p>
<p>Africans wanted to be free of white colonialism and whites gave them what they wanted; their freedom and independence. Now they have given the Chinese the right to exploit them. The difference here is that unlike whites, the Chinese don&rsquo;t believe they own the Africans anything in regards to correcting alleged historical injustices. The Chinese will take what they want as use the Africans as they see fit.  </p>

		<p>China is going to find out the hard way that developing Africa is very expensive, and that eventually whatever they do to bring Africa out of the iron age will be called exploitation by the Africans, after which they will be kicked out of Africa and all the things they brought will be nationalized and eventually destroyed by the Africans, who will then look for another sucker to come and help them.</p>

		<p>The simple fact is that the Chinese and most other East Asians see nothing wrong or unseemingly with making generalizations about different races.</p>
<p>They believe that we and Europeans no longer work as hard as we once did, that Latins are lazy and shiftless, and that black Africans are lazy, generally far less intelligent than other races, and prone to criminality.</p>
<p>Only whites go into the strangest intellectual contortions in try to explain the failures of blacks in the modern world.  And to be fair about it, this is a generalization to which there are many individual exceptions, but it&rsquo;s nonetheless a valid generalization.</p>

<p>Or we could go the other way.  We could step in, create nominal &#8216;no go zones&rsquo; of our own on the West African Coast (mostly miles and miles of the perfect white-sands-meet-blue-sea DESERT) with the idea of designing a sufficiently harmonious place on the planet for blacks to live that they are not necessarily all driven to come here and -some- might actually choose to go back.</p>
<p>Desalinization plants.  Automated farming.  Solar and Wind.  And enough basics that a NUMBERED (no overpop allowed, by immigration or birthrate) population could survive and learn simple trades like fishing, tourism and ranching. </p>
<p>Consider for a moment that African blacks are an object lesson in life: don&rsquo;t do too much, don&rsquo;t take too much, don&rsquo;t expect to be smart, don&rsquo;t expect to change, exploit every chance you get.  One that has endured for MILLENNIAL TIME, unaltered and surviving.  They are, representative in humans what actual animal species are in a wild environment: endurant.</p>
<p>And that could end up being a &#8216;live well but LIVE&rsquo; (if nothing else: breed young, maintain a sustainment level TFR) lesson for whites to accede to in a world where very few, even ammong our own, still have the residual intelligence margin (vs. the complexity of technology and investment) brains to succeed in any real career that nets them SES improvement.</p>
<p>If you could engineer a simple, largely incorruptible (robotic services), urban housing and services scheme for black Africans with near-moronic IQs, to live witin, much of what you learned could be equally applied to U.S. cities where whites are under similar deevolutionary pressure to fail.  Getting fatter, getting more specialized in their trivial knowledge, becoming more affable and less focussed.</p>

<p>Seem to indicate.</p>
<p>At the same time, I dare say that if Africa is to become China&rsquo;s &#8216;new frontier&rsquo;.  Much as America was for Europe.  Isn&rsquo;t it about time we got our fellow whites out of there?  No need to be caught in the middle of a race war with what little real property they have left going either up in smoke or up for bid when the dust settles.</p>

		<p>End of Illusion, yes, it&rsquo;s very different.  First, China already aligned itself with Africans in their effort to remove foreign involvement in their countries.  The Chinese should live by their words and leave Africa.  Second, as Immanuel Wallerstein wrote &#8220;In the sixteenth century, Europe was like a bucking bronco. The attempt of some groups to establish a world-economy based on a particular division of labor, to create national states in the core areas as politico-economic guarantors of this system, and to get the workers to pay not only the profits but the costs of maintaining the system was not easy. It was to Europe&rsquo;s credit that it was done, since without the thrust of the sixteenth century the modern world would not have been born and, for all its cruelties, it is better that it was born than that it had not been.&#8221;  As far as non-white people are concerned, European colonialism was far more positive than negative.  Europeans brought better health care, communications, better farming and so much more that I can&rsquo;t list them all to the rest of the world.  Non-white people like to point to the killing and slavery but don&rsquo;t want to look at all the life saving Europeans brought, it&rsquo;s no coincidence the world population exploded after European colonialization.  Third, stadiums are a Greek invention and building stadiums within newly conquered land is a Roman idea, two things the Chinese have copied to distract Africans with soccer, a European game they have grown to love, while they plunder the continent.  Fourth, the trade deficit with 16-19th century China was brought on by Chinese copying European/ American products and selling them to other Chinese so that Europeans/Americans had less to sell to China than the reverse.  The same thing goes on today where the Chinese copy and steal foreign products to sell domestically yet foreign nations buy actual Chinese products, China becomes a money pit so it&rsquo;s no wonder they have an enormous surplus.  The Chinese have always been dishonest in trade.  Fifth, opium was bought by Chinese in India and brought to China by Chinese.  Sixth, the destruction of the Summer Palace was totally justified because of the Chinese brutal killing of 20 British and Indian men.</p>

		<p>You people had better wake up and wake up fast, because China is your main threat. Your little feuds with the blacks, hispanics, and moslems will seem petty when you finally realise just how much the Chinese are starting to dominate the US economy. Chinese nationals- even now, are allowed to buy land in the US and many of them do, so remember that every time you buy something with a &#8220;Made in China&#8221; tag on it, because when you do you are essentially putting more money in Chinese hands and taking more money OUT of the US market.</p>

<p>The africans are now themselves endangered, though not as immediately as us Euros. China has a massive population and will eventually look at Africa as breeding room for their own folk.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Wrong on both counts my friend. 1) Dont kid yourself that white intervention can achieve or alter any geo-political situation. White America cant even tame a backwards state like Afghanistan (whose Taliban are not supported by a superpower as the Mujahaden before them were) and neither could the might USSR before it. Also do you honestly think black Africans will welcome whites with open arms? You obviously know nothing about African history.<br>
2) China&rsquo;s population growth like that of First world Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong and Communist North Korea is negligible. The East Asian population although large has the same growth rates as the White western world. The only people breeding en masse in China are the same people who breed en masse in white countries&hellip;.muslims and other dark skinned 3rd world hordes that have immigrated there. The type of Chinese who migrate to China are those who cannot compete in China. They therefore migrate to be amongst lessers such as the sub-saharan Aricans so they can rule over them. Their mindset is similar to Milton&rsquo;s Paradise Lost: &#8220;better to rule in Hell than serve in Heaven&#8221;.<b></b></b></p>

		<p>Poster #1 got it right.  Whites are the only people who will give blacks the time of days.  Liberals will faun all over them and conservatives will at least let them sit at the table, but no other races interact with blacks anywhere close to that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why when blacks are displaced by latinos here and there, they go and live with other blacks or in white neighborhoods.  I live in an area that is about 85% asian now.  You NEVER see a black family moving in, only out.</p>
<p>Similarly, I work in a 95% latino area.  You NEVER see any black people there, EVER.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t dispute that. The Chinese should not interfere in Africa negatively and cooperate with other nations in making Africa a better place through careful allocation of aid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Third, stadiums are a Greek invention and building stadiums within newly conquered land is a Roman idea, two things the Chinese have copied to distract Africans with soccer, a European game they have grown to love, while they plunder the continent.&#8221;</p>
<p>As stated above, I believe the Chinese should leave Africa. I should have made my view clearer in the first post. I just don&rsquo;t agree with you labelling the Chinese as evil and implying that such colonialist activities were limited to East Asians.</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as non-white people are concerned, European colonialism was far more positive than negative.&#8221;<br>
Again, I don&rsquo;t dispute this. But the source you cite also acknowledges that European colonialism was born out of greed, much like the Chinese colonialism today. It is entriely possible and likely that some good will come out of Chinese imperialism in Africa (they are building roads aren&rsquo;t they?) but not enough good to warrant a presence based on their hunger for Africa&rsquo;s resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fourth, the trade deficit with 16-19th century China was brought on by Chinese copying European/ American products and selling them to other Chinese so that Europeans/Americans had less to sell to China than the reverse.&#8221;<br>
As I understand it, the deficit was brought about by tea and porcelain exports, which are Chinese products, and not based on anay imitation as far as I know of (unlike today).</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifth, opium was bought by Chinese in India and brought to China by Chinese.&#8221;<br>
No it wasn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;s advise reading up on the activities of Lord Matheson.</p>
<p>&#8220;China becomes a money pit so it&rsquo;s no wonder they have an enormous surplus.&#8221;<br>
Is that their own fault or the fault of the West for allowing those products that generate the money to reach their markets?</p>
<p>&#8220;Sixth, the destruction of the Summer Palace was totally justified because of the Chinese brutal killing of 20 British and Indian men.&#8221;<br>
&#8220;An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind&#8221; The whole world is based on vengeance, and I believe it must stop.<br>
The British and Indian men were killed in retaliation for the opium trade and their attempts to renegotiate the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, hence the Palace is burnt down&hellip; fair enough. But I hope you will join me in wishing that China does not achieve hegemony in our lifetimes lest we live to see the ruins of Buckingham Palace and the Louvre.</p>
<p>The Chinese should not be in Africa, but neither should the Europeans have been a hundred years ago. It is unfair to label them savage or greedy, when Europeans did the same in the past. At the same time, China needs to withdraw from Africa and work with other East Asian and European nations to give Africa the better future it deserves.</p>
