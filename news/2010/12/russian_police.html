			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Simon Shuster, Time, December 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Around dusk on Dec. 11, Moscow&rsquo;s police chief, Vladimir Kolokoltsev, arrived at the scene of a race riot that his troops had failed to quell. Mobs of skinheads had savagely beaten dozens of passersby that afternoon in the streets and on the subway, leaving blood on the ground and swastikas scrawled on the walls across from the Kremlin gates. As Kolokoltsev stood there, thousands of rioters were still chanting racist slogans and throwing bottles and flares at his men. He decided it was time to negotiate. </p>
<p>For a police force not known for being shy with its truncheons, this was an unprecedented move, and it has solidified the growing belief among the Russian public that the authorities are either unable or unwilling to stop the recent wave of violence being perpetrated by the country&rsquo;s nationalists. &#8220;It was basically admitting defeat,&#8221; says Evgeny Valyaev, the shaven-headed leader of supremacist group Russky Obraz, whose members took part in Saturday&rsquo;s riots. &#8220;They shouldn&rsquo;t have provoked us. That was their mistake. So Kolokoltsev was forced to negotiate with a man in a black mask,&#8221; he told TIME in an interview Monday.</p>
<p>{snip} Of the 5,000 protesters who took part in Saturday&rsquo;s demonstration, only 65 were arrested, and all of them were released by the following day. Even though the protesters had no permission to rally, no effort was made to disperse the crowd until it turned violent. And, inexplicably, Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev went on television hours after the violence and blamed it on &#8220;a provocation from left-wing radicals,&#8221; leaving many puzzled as to where he had seen the influence of communists at a neofascist event.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><br>
{snip} In August, Viktor Lukonin, a major in the Federal Protective Service, was charged with leading an ultra-nationalist gang responsible for arson attacks and bombings in the western region of Oryol. He denies the charges. But Elena Tyuryukanova, Russia&rsquo;s leading defender of migrants&rsquo; rights, sees his case as part of a broader trend. &#8220;Xenophobic sentiment is building, the pressure is rising, and our police forces show that they either cannot control it, or do not want to,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Now we&rsquo;re faced with a situation where people are afraid to go into the streets, and at the same time, they can&rsquo;t turn to the police for help. They feel totally unprotected.&#8221; </p>
<p>And nationalists tend to feel the opposite. On Wednesday, they are set to stage another demonstration at Moscow&rsquo;s Kievsky train station, home of a huge flower market run mostly by immigrants from the Caucasus region. If the immigrants come armed, says Russky Obraz leader Valyaev, &#8220;it could look more like a war than a riot.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Monday, the leaders of Russia&rsquo;s soccer-fan associations denied their links to the radical right, and senior government officials have also claimed the two movements are not connected. But according to Valyaev, nationalists have become &#8220;completely intertwined&#8221; with the soccer movement in recent years, swelling the ranks of groups like his. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve reached the point where the leadership [of the soccer clubs] will have to accept the nationalist cause,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Or most of the fans will simply break away from those organizations and start their own.&#8221; </p>
<p>If he turns out to be right, nationalist groups will easily be able to field thousands of protesters whenever they please, and the government will have to come up with better ways of controlling their baser instincts. For now, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has not even commented on Saturday&rsquo;s violence, nor has Moscow&rsquo;s new mayor, Sergei Sobyanin. But the image of the police chief meekly chatting with a rioter in a balaclava is a sign of victory to Russia&rsquo;s neo-Nazis. It&rsquo;s little wonder they now seem high on their own impunity.<br>

		<p>Russia needs a right of return policy along with strong incentives to have children and strong disincentives to not have children.  Russia for the Russians is an idea whose time is long overdue.  Since the revolution the Russian people have had the culture and aspirations suppressed while being used to prop-up the USSR.  Now they are being used to prop-up &#8220;autonomous republics&#8221; within Russia while being taken over by those same people.  The Russians deserve the right to live among there own!<br>

		<p>There are a lot of omissions in this story.</p>
<p>1. The uprising of soccer fans was caused by the gov&rsquo;t officials release of 5 of the 6 killers of Russian football fan. The killers were from the Caucus region.</p>
<p>2. The riots were only partially &#8220;racist&#8221;. But rather more ethnic. The anger was directed against Caucasians(yes that&rsquo;s what Whites are officially called in the USA) and Asians. Against people of &#8220;non-slavic appearance&#8221; as Russian officials are in habit of saying.</p>
<p>Here, these 4 were attacked (Russian Special Police man to the right): <a href="https://kp.ru/f/3/image/71/22/1212271.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://kp.ru/f/3/image/71/22/1212271.jpg</a></p>
<p>So much for American media reports&hellip;</p>
<p>For American audience, understand, essentially it&rsquo;s like laid back blond Swedes attacking &#8220;hot blooded swarthy&#8221; Italians.</p>

<p>This is kinda funny. Sounds like it&rsquo;s the exact opposite of &#8216;riot coverage&rsquo; in the West. Left wing protesters break up &#8216;free speech&rsquo; events on campus and in high profile economic summits and the implication is always that it is the right responsible. In fact the fear of &#8216;violence&rsquo; is even used to restrict speech or activities of those on the right without, of course, admitting this violence is coming from the left. This press release is completely backwards. It does show that once the &#8216;communists&rsquo; are driven from influence our country can once again return to a semblance of what is normal. </p>

		<p>This event is incredible.  In Russia it appears that there are actually Whites who are willing to fight for their country.  Can you imagine if Whites here in the U.S. had done the same thing?  To wit:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mobs of skinheads had savagely beaten dozens of passersby that afternoon in the streets and on the subway, leaving blood on the ground and swastikas scrawled on the walls&#8221; &hellip;  He decided it was time to negotiate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Would it be considered inciting to violence to predict that a similar event or events here in the U.S. might help to awaken the White world?</p>

		<p>Why immigrants in a foreign country who are resented and not wanted by a majority of the population refuse to leave is beyond my understanding.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way in the world I would want to stay in a foreign land if I were shunned and the population there made it known they wanted the region for themselves without foreigners.</p>
<p>These non-white foreigners in the US not only don&rsquo;t care about how the native population feels, they eventually get the attitude that the land really belongs to them.</p>
<p>I really believe their mind-set is due to stupidity.  They believe as they do based on what they&rsquo;ve been scammed into believing.  </p>

		<p>The caucasus people are of full or mixed turkic origins. They tend to be pretty different from slavs in temperament as well as external appearance. They are not popular in Russia because of their high criminality.</p>

		<p>Unlike in the US and Europe, the Orthodox Church in Russia is ethnically conscious and nationalistic. &#8220;Orthodoxy or Death&#8221; T-shirts express more about Russian nationalism than distinctions between &#8220;Caucasians&#8221; and Slavs. The fault line of ethnic differences divides along a Christian-Muslim bias. Whatever their political differences, Russians do not regard Ukrainians and Georgians with the same ethnic hostility as the Muslim &#8220;-stan&#8221; regions. </p>
<p>Also, some races, particularly blacks, have no hesitation mixing with white people. Either they do detect a latent threat or they are predisposed to live in a racially competitive environment. Either way, whites are the threatened species. </p>

		<p> Yes, in some ways the Russian predicament is confusing for white Americans. Most white Americans would consider the Russian &#8220;racial&#8221; problems more ethnic or religious than racial. I personally consider our racial problems not only more serious, but more likely to reach critical mass sooner. Russians have a healthy sense of racial identity, which we lack in both the United States and most of Western Europe. </p>

		<p>Unwilling?  Of course they are.  Politicians are always afraid to go against popular sentiment, which is determined in politics by who can yell the loudest.  &#8220;Yelling&#8221; in terms of intensity starting off with things like quiet protests and or sit-ins, followed by protests that get somewhat out of hand, followed by full blown riots.</p>
<p>Which is why, aside from Russia, white people are currently fighting a losing battle when it comes to politics.  If you want your message to be heard, you have to yell it from the streets.  Sure there&rsquo;s the American 3rd Party, but how many of them have you seen running for office lately?  Exactly.</p>

<p>These people are only counted as whites by the US census. In Europe (and that includes Russia) they are considered 3rd world darkies from western asia. You americans have some kind of all inclusive defintion of white where everyone who isnt asian or black is white. </p>

		<p>#6 Q,</p>
<p>No, the forced accomodation of lower social classes has always been a part of white ethno dominance.  Going back centuries.  You get a healthy, hard working, population together and then you destroy by ethnic or class division so that they never attain the social awareness necessary to question the motives of their leadership.</p>
<p>Jews, Irish, Italians, Hungarians and Czechs.  Just the 20th century alone has been a huge exercise in Social Control 101.</p>
<p>As for &#8216;Non Slavic Appearance&rsquo; Caucasians showing up in Russian ethno state and wanting their own chunk, think how desperate the situation must be where you come from to want to live on the brittle edge of the razor in Russia.  To an American it&rsquo;s a frightful thought that -anyone- would want to live there.</p>
<p>And yet look at the boys in that picture-</p>

<p>Huddled together, not man to stand tall among them.  Herd creatures.  And since immigrants DO come from hardship and DO know they are hated, they both stand tall and act together to ensure their place in a society which doesn&rsquo;t want to admit they exist.  Until they breed their way to significance.</p>
<p>Whoever first said that racism was an act of evil has no idea the harm they have brought to the civility of man and the the ONE geneline branch of us that has consistently done the most to advance, not just our own cullture.  But that of homo sapiens itself.</p>

<p>That is correct. In Russia they are called &#8220;Blacks&#8221;. But in the 1930&rsquo;s America Italians were considered to be almost Mulattoes. Perceptions change. You have to draw a boundary somewhere. I do not believe that the poor mountain men from Caucasus belong in modern European city such as Moscow. They are quite wild. But that does not change the fact that they are Europeoid, Europid, Caucasoid, Caucasian, White race.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll state a point that might be too obvious to mention:  in the USA and much of Europe, when militant minority groups use violence to shut down conservative speakers, or to form flash mobs, riot over police actions, or whatever, university administrations frequently stand aside, and law enforcement response is often muted. So you have a similar situation in Russia today, only the state is taking the side of the majority group. </p>
<p>This must seem unreal to the multicultist elites in the West, though it is the same policy they carry out   &mdash;   with, again, militant minority groups as the beneficiaries. </p>

		<p>From the Lambeth Walk:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just worth remembering, as always, that there are two sides to every story. I remember when race riots broke out in the northern Russian town of Kondopoga in 2006.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the BBC version:</p>
<p>    Extra police have been deployed in Kondopoga after hundreds of ethnic Russians burned cars and businesses owned by traders from the Caucasus.</p>
<p>    More than 100 people have been arrested in the town, and three of them charged with murder, prosecutors say.</p>
<p>    The violence was sparked by the death of two ethnic Russians last week during a cafe fight with Chechens.</p>
<p>    Kondopoga lies about 100km (60 miles) north of Petrozavodsk - the capital of Russia&rsquo;s republic of Karelia.</p>
<p>    Reports from the town say members of far-right groups from across the country travelled to the town to join in the violence. </p>
<p>Interesting. Here&rsquo;s another view on the same events, which strangely provides more details about the mysterious deaths of the two Russians:</p>
<p>    There&rsquo;s was a brawl that left two of the Russians dead. Nothing is said about the cause of their death. Could they have a heart attack? Quite possible. Here&rsquo;s the actual chain of events. Two Russians at the restaurant &ldquo;Chaika&rdquo; had a brawl with the waiter who supposedly brought them cheap vodka in a bottle from expensive one. Russians refused to pay for it. The barman called the local Chechen &ldquo;rescue team&rdquo;.</p>
<p>    It arrived an hour later when Russians who actually started the brawl already left. About 15 Chechens armed with knives, sharpened steel bars and baseball bats rushed into the restaurant, cried, &ldquo;Allahu Akbar!&rdquo; and started thrashing indiscriminately everyone who was unlucky to be at the restaurant by that time. People were defending themselves with chairs and tables. In less than 5 minutes the Chechen &ldquo;rescue team&rdquo; killed two men and mutilated 15, eight of them were beaten within an inch of their life. Having done that Chechens left the restaurant. During the &ldquo;brawl&rdquo; two local police cars were staying right at the restaurant and later a third one came. Policemen didn&rsquo;t interfere. Later it became known that they actually were on the rescue team&rsquo;s payroll and in fact were giving protection to the bandits.</p>
<p>Apparently this mutilation included two Russians having eyes gouged out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s such a thing as mass racist violence - but there&rsquo;s also such a thing as the incidents which build up to spark it off. We only know what we&rsquo;re told - and it increasingly seems our own media are as biased, in their own way, as a known Russian mouthpiece. </p>
