<h1>Martinique Man Convicted of Making Racist Remarks</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rodolphe Lamy, Yahoo News, Dec. 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A court has found an 84-year-old businessman guilty of condoning a crime against humanity for praising slavery during a TV interview and sentenced him Wednesday to pay a fine of nearly $10,000.</p>
<p>Alain Despointes made the comments at a moment when the French Caribbean territory was convulsed by protests over high prices and low wages and by resentment that the primarily white, &#8220;beke&#8221; descendants of slaveholders control much of the local economy.</p>
<p>Despointes, one of the beke elite, also criticized mixed-race marriages during the interview aired in late January 2009 and said he wanted to &#8220;preserve his race.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is the first man in Martinique found guilty under a 2001 French law that declared slavery a crime against humanity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despointes had argued that his comments were taken out of context in the documentary on Martinique&rsquo;s bekes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Historians exaggerated the problems a bit. They talk above all about the bad aspects of slavery,&#8221; he said in the documentary. &#8220;But there were good aspects, too &hellip; There were colonizers who were very humane with their slaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despointes is a well-known businessman in Martinique whose case was followed closely. He oversees more than 500 workers as a major bottler and distributor of products including Coca Cola and Yoplait. He also is a member of the Legion of Honor, a French order whose members include military officials, entrepreneurs and renowned athletes.</p>
<p>Frantz Lebon, an attorney representing one of three civil rights groups that filed a complaint, said the conviction &#8220;is a warning to all those who want to take the same path,&#8221; though he called the penalties &#8220;timid&#8221; and &#8220;purely symbolic.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the fine, Despointes was ordered to publish a letter detailing the case and to give more than $3,000 to a local civil rights organization.</p>

There are many degrees of slavery, from bondage in chains to indentured servitude to debt slavery.</p>
<p>Some would claim that landlording and issueing loans are legalized forms of enslavement. By the widely accepted definition of slavery, this man never enslaved anyone or condoned &#8220;crimes against humanity&#8221;.</p>
<p>This man was convicted merely for expressing his views out loud.  </p>

		<p>France is supposed to allow free speech. In the <i>Déclaration des droits de l&rsquo;Homme et du Citoyen</i>  states in article 11: The free communication of thoughts and of opinions is one of the most precious rights of man: any citizen thus may speak, write, print freely, save [if it is necessary] to respond to the abuse of this liberty, in the cases determined by the law.</p>
<p>Hitler supported speech for views that he liked. So did Stalin and Mao. But freedom of speech is not about exclusively supporting views that the government approves of. Free speech is about allowing <i>everyone,</i> regardless of how controversial their views are, to voice their opinion freely.</p>
<p>There is no longer freedom of speech in France and the rest of Europe.</p>

Well, obviously, yes. And that is because Blacks are incapable of controlling any real economy, anywhere. Look at what South Africa has become!</p>

		<p>What happens if you doubt slavery even existed. I mean &#8216;slavery&rsquo;? </p>
<p>If everything else we are taught about the past turns out to be untrue why would it be any different with slavery? If everything else is a lie you&rsquo;d almost have to be stupid to believe anything we are told about the conditions of blacks in the new world as slaves or doubt if it even existed at all.</p>

		<p>Slavery is eternal, it will always be here.  Those who cannot control themselves will be controlled by others.  Race-mixing destroys human bio-diversity, and is therefore evil.  In your face, haters.</p>

		<p>Some folks sure are working hard to make sure that people fear being called &#8220;racist&#8221;.   </p>
<p>Let no one be fooled: in the newspeak, &#8220;racist&#8221; means &#8220;anyone not sufficiently anti-white&#8221;.</p>
<p>All taxpaying whites are in involuntary servitude to a billion blacks right now.  Whites are forced to work and give up the fruits of that labor to support the exploding population of blacks (both in Africa and elsewhere), even as their own numbers fall because they don&rsquo;t believe they can afford their own children. </p>
<p>This is both slavery and genocide.   </p>

		<p>If what he said is so outrageous then wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier to refute it and show him foolish for having said it? Ah, but maybe what he said wasn&rsquo;t so outrageous. Therefore they <i>had</i> to censor it instead. Censorship is the beginning of tyranny. </p>

		<p>A pathetic case. If slavery was entirely a crime against humanity with intolerable living conditions, then why did the number of slaves increase after the slave trade was abolished? I guess life was so bad that the slaves felt compelled to reproduce so their children could have a horrible life.</p>
<p>If France has declared slavery a &#8216;crime against humanity&rsquo;, then when will the French arrest the Premier of China next time he visits? Or the current leader of Mauretania? Oh that&rsquo;s right, the only slavery that counts ended over a century ago and involved long dead Whites enslaving long dead blacks.</p>
<p>Too bad for you if you&rsquo;re a slave for commiting a thought crime in North Korea or a slave held by some nomad in Mauretania</p>

		<p>That was a fairly mild comment that was not even endorsing slavery. That fine was a crime against humanity as it was an attack against free speech. </p>

		<p>I may be a racist but I am against slavery. All slavery does is allow a few men to get rich off the labor of others. </p>
<p>Anyone that was part of the slave trade didn&rsquo;t do us any favors. I would be happy if every African were still living in Africa. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this elderly gentleman was claiming that slavery was justified, I think he was just pointing out that it can often be exaggerated. There are many different forms of slavery, in many cases, slaves were treated as important members of the household who were indespensable. Other times they were barely alive. Slavery is an abomination no doubt, and one of the biggest mistakes in Western history.</p>
<p><br>
But ten thousand dollars? Dear France, it is called freedom of speech and you violated it with your fascist obsessions.  At least in America (for now) you can say what you wish without fear of being financially crippled or jailed.<br>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a form of slavery worse -far worse- than chattel slavery and that&rsquo;s enslavement of the mind.  Better to have your body subdued than your spirit, which is what happened to this hapless white man in Martinique.<p>And by the way, his point that African slavery in the New World was not necessarily &#8220;hell on earth&#8221; for the slaves has been well documented in works like &#8220;Time on the Cross&#8221; and surviving oral narratives of former slaves themselves gathered in the 1930&rsquo;s.</p></p>

		<p>What surprises me is that there are any whites living on Martinique, at all. It&rsquo;s predominantly the same people that inhabit Haiti.</p>
<p>The people of Martinique never rebuilt the capital city of St. Pierre, after it was destroyed in that volcanic eruption courtesy of Mt. Pele, on May 15, 1902.</p>

Ah, but Martinique is still part of France   &mdash;   still under French rule, French prosperity, and French protection.  A world of difference from Haiti!</p>
