			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Wynne-Jones, Telegraph (London), December 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>John Bercow has backed the creation of a team of multi-faith chaplains, which will also include representatives of the Hindu, Buddhist and Jainist religions.</p>
<p>Members of the House have expressed surprise at the move, which some have described as &#8220;an exercise in politically-correct box ticking&#8221;.</p>
<p>It could mean that religious leaders of non-Christian faiths will take part in parliamentary ceremonies, though there would need to be constitutional reform to allow them to read the daily prayers.</p>
<p>At present, the Speaker&rsquo;s Chaplain is the only person allowed to say the prayers before each day&rsquo;s sitting and the role has been filled by an Anglican cleric since the office was created in 1660.</p>
<p>The proposal to introduce a multi-faith chaplaincy was made by the current chaplain, the Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who was appointed by Mr Bercow against the wishes of the Very Rev John Hall, the Dean of Westminster.</p>
<p>Mrs Hudson-Wilkin has fought for greater recognition of ethnic minorities in the Church of England and said she was excited by the move.</p>
<p>The new chaplains will not receive a salary and their role is yet to be specified, but she said they will help to ensure everyone&rsquo;s pastoral needs are cared for.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hospitals and prisons already have this type of chaplaincy system so it&rsquo;s no big deal we&rsquo;re now doing the same,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I move around the House I discover people from all walks of life and this seems like the responsible thing to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, MPs have questioned whether there is a need to set up a multi-faith chaplaincy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I welcome the news that this is being introduced if there is a demand for it, but until now I haven&rsquo;t been aware of such a demand,&#8221; said David Amess, the Conservative MP for Southend West.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m puzzled by it as I can&rsquo;t imagine who has asked for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>While there are now eight Muslim MPs, there are not thought to be any Jains, Bahá&rsquo;ís or Zoroastrians.</p>
<p>&#8220;It smacks of an exercise in politically-correct box ticking,&#8221; said one MP.</p>
<p>Ann Widdecombe, the former minister, said: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with it if a number of staff want a visiting chaplain, but it starts to become ridiculous if you have every last religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The move has been backed by the Rt Rev Richard Chartres, Bishop of London, who has previously talked of the benefits of having a multi-faith chaplaincy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parliament is increasingly diverse in its make up, reflecting the changing face of our country,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chaplaincy service needs to evolve as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see her [Mrs Hudson-Wilkin] playing a very creative part in assembling a team of Chaplains from the nine major world religions to serve both the Speaker and those who work here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoroastrianism is one of the world&rsquo;s oldest monotheistic religions and has had a presence in Britain since 1723.</p>
<p>The first three ethnic MPs elected to the House of Commons are believed to have been followers, but there are now less than 200,000 of them worldwide.</p>
<p>Zoroastrians believe there is one God called Ahura Mazda (Wise Lord) who revealed the truth through the Prophet, Zoroaster.</p>
<p>There are around 6,000 Bahá&rsquo;ís in the UK, who believe that Bahá&rsquo;u&rsquo;lláh is the most recent in a long line of divinely inspired prophets, including Jesus, Muhammad and Buddha.</p>
<p>In contrast, there are now up to 2.4 million Muslims in Britain who are playing an increasingly active role in politics with leading figures including Baroness Warsi, the Conservative chairman, and Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice minister.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Speaker said: &#8220;It has long been established practice at the Palace of Westminster for the Speaker&rsquo;s chaplain to invite individuals from different denominations to visit on an occasional basis to be available to Members and staff.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Speaker&rsquo;s chaplain, following discussions with the Bishop of London, is looking at ways to widen the pool of visiting clergy to include individuals from different faith groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is to better reflect the range of beliefs held by Members and staff in the House.&#8221;<br>

		<p>One of the saddest and strangest things about Christianity in England is that the main attacks upon it come from the clergy themselves. They seem to think it a Christian virtue to demean Christianity and exalt other religions.</p>
<p>And then they wonder why their Churches are emptying.</p>

<p>And Khan comes from a culture background that is so full of justice? Like Pakistan and the Indian sub-continent for instance? They are so just there. </p>

Most christian denominations in western Europe and America have made it their personal objective to unify all the worlds religions under a single body as though they were kings.<br>
Even pastors in the Navy promote secularism.<br>
Why?<br>
Why do the catholics routinely change their catechisms and protect pedophiles?<br>
Why do the Evangelical churches embrace homosexuality and promote openly homosexual priests?<br>
Why are homosexuality, secularism, and sex crimes, tied togeather while the heads of most christian and non-christian religions want to unify under a single theology?<br>
There is something fishy in Denmark.</p>

<b>&#8220;Multi-Faith Chaplains to Make House of Commons More Inclusive&#8221; </b></p>
<p>Why have any at all?<br>
This is just more multyculty pandering to our new &#8220;minorities&#8221;.<br>
In the United States, a country with no state religion, faith is supposed to be a private matter.<br>
So they should KEEP it that way!</p>

<p>Another example of just how low the Church of England has fallen. Is it any wonder why no one attends church anymore? How about instead of having prayers from every wacky cult of the Orient we just abolish the chaplain position altogether.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zoroastrianism is one of the world&rsquo;s oldest monotheistic religions and has had a presence in Britain since 1723.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Really? And how LARGE a presence? Have there EVER been more a couple dozen of them in all of UK? </p>
<p>Have you ever MET a Zoroastrian? Because I never have, and I&rsquo;ve been around over half a century, and have done a fair bit of traveling and interacted with a fairly wide selection of humanity. In my life, the only time I even HEAR the word &#8220;Zoroastrian&#8221; is in one of Mozart&rsquo;s operas. </p>
<p>For the House of Commons to pander to a tiny handful of Zoroastrians is silly. For them to pander to Muslims is worse than silly, it&rsquo;s SUICIDAL. </p>
