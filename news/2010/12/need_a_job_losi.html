	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For decades, hoodoo shops appeared to be dying off. But the Internet, and troubled times, have given rituals once performed only in backwoods cabins or shabby urban shops a new life. Hoodoo practitioners and retailers say sales are booming as people from across the country turn to them for help slashing debt, preventing foreclosures or finding jobs. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hoodoo is thought to have evolved on southern plantations as an amalgam of African religions. Influences from European folk practices and Native American beliefs were mixed in. Black people across the South fashioned charms from everyday items, local herbs and animal parts to protect themselves or to hurt others. Many rituals revolved around increasing or restoring one&rsquo;s &#8220;mojo&#8221;  &mdash;  energy, power and sexual prowess.</p>
<p>While the line between hoodoo and the better-known Voodoo often blurs in popular culture, the two belief systems have different, if similar, origins. Hoodoo arose among slaves in English-speaking American colonies. Voodoo developed among slaves in French-speaking Haiti and Louisiana as its own religion, incorporating African gods and Catholicism.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, white pharmacists in black neighborhoods began marketing hoodoo items through mail order after noticing they were fielding a lot of questions from their black customers about roots, herbs and potions. Their shops fell on hard times in the 1970s, in part because many African-Americans began to view hoodoo, also known as rootwork or conjure, as backward, say scholars who study the practice. &#8220;As African-Americans came more in the mainstream and more affluent, they were embarrassed by this stuff,&#8221; says Carolyn Morrow Long, author of &#8220;Spiritual Merchants,&#8221; a book about hoodoo stores.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s hoodoo revival is again being driven primarily by white retailers, and that has some blacks criticizing the commercialization of ancient rituals for a quick profit. &#8220;Hoodoo is not just oh-help-me-bring-my-baby-back, help-me-get-my-man-back stuff,&#8221; says Katrina Hazzard-Donald, a Rutgers University sociology professor who is black and was taught hoodoo as a child. She says hoodoo stores are corrupting the spiritual belief system by selling inferior, nonsacred products and focusing on alleged quick fixes to problems. &#8220;What is so pathetic about it is they don&rsquo;t even know the origins of all this stuff,&#8221; Ms. Hazzard-Donald says of online hoodoo vendors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The backlash isn&rsquo;t stopping retailers like LuckyMojo.com. One of the largest Internet sources of hoodoo products, booklets and online courses, the site has 23,000 customers in its database and more than 3,000 people registered on a community forum, says owner Catherine Yronwode. </p>
<p>Ms. Yronwode, a 63 year-old one-time hippie who stumbled upon hoodoo when it was mentioned in old Blues lyrics, says LuckyMojo has tapped into a renewed interest in &#8220;the old ways.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I listened to your grandmother when you didn&rsquo;t,&#8221; Ms. Yronwode, who is white, says to her black customers. Her site, which she runs from her farm in northern California, offers hundreds of spells and potions, including &#8220;attraction powder&#8221; to draw a loved one, and &#8220;goofer&#8221; dust, made with dead spiders, to make an enemy sick  &mdash;  or worse. She sells packets of graveyard dirt. {snip}</p>
<p>Tammie, a 40-year-old white insurance agent in Florida, who asked that her last name not be used, says she found hoodoo last year when she suffered health and financial problems. She has spent about $500 so far on items from LuckyMojo, including candles to give her protection to oils for attracting money. Both her health and her financial situation have improved, she says.</p>

		<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t know or don&rsquo;t care how they&rsquo;re being used. It took WHITE Abolitionists, Liberals &amp; Capitalists to manipulate them into a &#8216;freedom&rsquo; that has seen the Blacks imprisoned, jobless &amp; on social assistance while their families &amp; religiosity are broken down almost completely, supplanted by an individualistic materialistic nationalism and an urban culture of poverty rooted in flaunting criminality and having children out of wedlock. Yet they still drop N-bombs &amp; sit at the back of the bus</p>

		<p>It can be difficult for white men and women to understand how blacks think, because our minds are wired so differently. This may take some effort to absorb, but the unfortunate fact is that the vast majority of blacks believe that white people get steady jobs, sufficient income, better test scores, etc. due to some sort of white-privilege magic. It doesn&rsquo;t occur to them that whites achieve success through studying hard, working long hours, planning ahead, being responsible with money, etc. Nope, it must be white man juju.</p>

		<p>I think hoodoo is covered under Obamacare. Forget about that bypass - it costs too much. Why spend $20,000 when you can spend $300 at LuckyMojo for those plaque-destroying candles.</p>
<p>When certain members of an advanced society, after 50 years and $60 billion of effort, still cannot pass even basic educational exams and find it wise, in the year 2010, to actually buy packets of graveyard dirt, I think it&rsquo;s time to re-think integration. </p>
<p>How long before Harvard starts a department of &#8220;Hoodoo Studies&#8221;? </p>

		<p>Blacks have to rely on white merchants for their Hoodoo paraphernalia? Is that really surprising? They have to rely on Arabs for their convenience stores, for Asians for their general goods, and on whites for just about everything else. Blacks seem to lack the entrepreneurial gene and always have. Sadly, the only area in which they have shown real initiative is in the drug trade. </p>

		<p> I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with the author&rsquo;s definition of Hoodoo. In my opinion, Hoodoo, based on my Southern living, is mostly &#8220;white or grey magic&#8221;, while Voodoo includes more harmful &#8220;black magic&#8221;. As far as whites running the merchandising of Hoodoo/Voodoo, this is obvious to anyone who has lived in the Deep South. Most Yankees have no idea how superstitious Southern blacks really are. I say come on down to Beulah Land with the other snow birds and see for yourself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is so pathetic about it is they don&rsquo;t even know the origins of all this stuff,&rdquo; [Rutgers University sociology professor] Ms. Hazzard-Donald says of online hoodoo vendors.</p>
<p><br>
Well, Ms. Hazzard-Donald, what I find pathetic is that a Rutgers University sociology professor would give this superstitious nonsense the time of day   &mdash;   let alone DEFEND it in public. </p>
<p>As for the racial angle   &mdash;   whites are producers and retailers, while blacks are merely passive consumers   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s merely the same as for any other product. Despite the fact that the average black grows up knowing far more about Hoodoo   &mdash;   including knowing its widespread popularity among other blacks   &mdash;   than the average white, it apparently never occurs to any of these superstitious blacks that they might be able to make some money selling the stuff to their own kind. So, as always, a lucrative (if silly) market within the ghetto goes untapped&hellip; until some enterprising non-black from outside the ghetto steps in and takes their $$$ off them. </p>
<p>Frankly, if these people are willing to hand over their legal tender for graveyard dirt   &mdash;   which can be found FREE at your local cemetary   &mdash;   I&rsquo;m kind of tempted to get into the Hoodoo biz myself. For me, the only part of Hoodoo retailing that looks even remotely challenging would be keeping a straight face while explaining your products&rsquo; &#8220;benefits&#8221; to your customers. </p>
