<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p> <span class="dropcap">L</span>ike the rest of Europe, Belgium is in
the process of transforming itself. In Brussels, the symbol of this
transformation is a neighborhood not far from a big downtown
intersection called Porte de Namur. Long ago, the neighborhood had a
Belgian name, which no one can remember. Now it is known as Matongé, a
street name in Kinshasa, in the Congo. Over the last several decades,
Africans have gradually taken over. </p>
        <p> Until the early
1990s, Matongé was a pleasant place to visit. African students   &mdash;   mostly
from the former Belgian Congo   &mdash;   gathered to socialize, and African
shops seemed as welcoming to Belgians as they were exotic. No one was
afraid of blacks. Later, Belgium, like so many other Western countries,
put out the welcome mat for refugees from the civil wars, genocides,
and tribal massacres that are tearing Africa apart. The change in
population led to changes in behavior. Matongé has become an outpost of
Africa, and the most dangerous part of Brussels. Crime has spread
throughout the city to the point that some inhabitants now jokingly
refer to their city as &#8220;Bronxelles.&#8221; </p>
        <table class="boxright">
          <tbody><tr>
            <td><img src="/ar/2005/06/BELGIA1sml.JPG" alt="Conglolese Belgians" height="288" width="216" /> </td>

          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>
About half the population of Matongé are now foreigners: Mostly
Congolese, but also Senegalese, Rwandans, Burundians, Malians, etc.
They hang about on the streets in such numbers that they no longer feel
constrained to adopt the manners and customs of the country in which
they live. Matongé has lost what remained of its Belgian soul, and is
now an overseas suburb of some African metropolis, complete with petty
hustles, violence, and a constant state of semi-anarchy. Belgians are
leaving the area, and few whites venture in as visitors. </p>
        <p>
If you visit Matongé you will find a gigantic outdoor mural. Its style
is reminiscent of the propaganda posters Communists and other dictators
used to put up to celebrate their dogmas. This bit of Belgian
propaganda celebrates friendship between peoples, and especially
between Belgians and Africans. </p>
        <p> The Galerie
d&rsquo;Ixelles, a little covered street off the main thoroughfare, has
gradually become the headquarters for African crime. Here was born an
African gang that took an American name, and for which brutality has
been its watchword. Here was born <i>Black Démolition</i>. </p>
        <p>
It was on Galerie d&rsquo;Ixelles that on June 19, 2001, the police carried
out what they called Operation Alpha, an attempt to bring a little
order to the area. For some weeks, African gangs had been fighting for
control of the drug trade, first with fists, then with knives and even
with guns. (For Belgians knifings are practically unheard of; shootings
happen only in the movies.) Two weeks earlier a colored gentleman by
the name of Pitchoun had been stabbed in a gang rivalry. The next week
violence had spilled out onto Rue Saint Josse and Rue Verbist, and the
police picked up a collection of machetes, knives, and box cutters. A
few days later, a few of Mr. Pitchoun&rsquo;s friends came across members of
the other gang; the altercation ended in yet another stabbing. The next
day there were more reprisals, when persons unknown lobbed two Molotov
cocktails into a bar called Magritte, headquarters of one of the gangs.
This sort of thing had to stop. </p>
        <p> The very day before
Operation Alpha, police noticed Africans loitering in a local park, who
fled at the sight of the authorities. A quick check of the bushes
turned up tear gas grenades, knives, and eight folding hand saws. Hand
saws? The police had not forgotten an earlier incident in which seven
members of one gang pounced on a rival in a streetcar and, before the
eyes of the dumb-founded passengers, nearly sawed off his hand. </p>
        <p>
Operation Alpha proceeded without incident but without much success:
The police issued a dozen summonses that went nowhere, and seized a few
knives and a small amount of drugs. Still, it was a sign of the times.
By 2001, Congolese criminals were beginning to make a name for
themselves. The police and even the public were beginning to notice. </p>
        <p>
A special police report published that year revealed that many gang
members had come to Belgium as children in the early 1990s, accompanied
by various &#8220;aunts&#8221; or &#8220;uncles&#8221; who were soon out of their depth in the
complexities of an industrial society. Many left school, where they
could not keep up, and since they had no one looking after them, ended
up on the streets. Many were criminals by the time they were age 12 or
13. </p>
        <table class="quoteleft">
          <tbody><tr>
            <th> As an expert on gangs explains, &#8220;For all of them, gangs are an identity, a chance to live a life that is authentically <i>black</i>.&#8221; </th>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>
The report continued: &#8220;They will steal a VW Golf in Brussels and drive
it to Holland to buy hashish. They will steal a Ford Fiesta in
Amsterdam for the drive back to Belgium, and if they find a girl
hitchhiking they will pick her up and gang rape her. They have no sense
of guilt. If you try to explain to them it is wrong to attack an
89-year-old woman they will tell you there is nothing they can do about
it if the old broad won&rsquo;t let go of her handbag and has to be knocked
down. They are predators, true predators.&#8221; </p>
        <p> The
report also quoted officers who complained of the constraints under
which they had to work because these criminals are so young: </p>
        <blockquote>
&#8220;I recall one youngster who had been involved in 18 crimes including a
holdup at Ixelles, two thefts from vehicles, a home invasion in Liège,
and a car-jacking in a discotheque parking lot between Brussels and
Anvers. It took us a year to nab him. The very next day, he was back on
the street  &hellip;&#8221; </blockquote>
        <p>
Another complaint: &#8220;There are thugs the court protects from being
photographed and put into our files, so we can&rsquo;t show their pictures to
victims or witnesses.&#8221; </p>
        <p> The report noted that
Congolese who arrived in Belgium after about the age of eight or ten
grew up with an African state of mind. Some fought in the civil and
tribal wars in Congo, Rwanda, and Angola. Some were boy soldiers.
Others were born in Belgium, but that seems to make little difference.
As Frédéric Van Leeuw, family court judge and expert on youth gangs
explains, &#8220;For all of them, gangs are an identity, a chance to live a
life that is authentically <i>black</i>.&#8221; (Mr. Van Leeuw used the
English word &#8220;black,&#8221; as do many Africans living in Europe. It is a
sign of the extent to which aggressive American expressions of
blackness influence how Africans view themselves.) </p>
        <p>
These young immigrants conformed to a kind of ethnic constant: They
quickly established social structures like those of an American black
ghetto or African slum, forming gangs in which violence is the primary
means of self-expression. They live by what appears to be instinct:
muggings, attacks on the weak and elderly, car-jackings, rape. </p>
        <p>
As Judge Van Leeuw puts it: &#8220;Groups like this are almost exclusively
African. There are similar groups of young African girls. All are
characterized by extreme violence. Individually, these young people can
show extraordinary acts of kindness. Nevertheless, they are almost all
armed with knives or even folding garden saws. Joining a group requires
some demonstration of qualifications, usually an act of violence.&#8221; </p>
        <p>
The first gangs appeared in the early 1990s and can be traced to
gatherings at which young Congolese met in the evenings to dance and
socialize. These parties quickly jumped the tracks. Fascinated by
violence and looking for ways to express themselves as racial
minorities, they looked to America. In 1991, inspired by an American
movie about New York gang wars called <i>New Jack City,</i> a Brussels gang started calling itself <i>New Jack.</i> </p>

          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> Other gang names came from more prosaic sources. <i>Les Finest</i>
came from &#8220;Finest Gordon,&#8221; a beer of high alcohol content sold in
half-liter bottles that Africans drink in great quantity. Today there
are many gangs with colorful names: <i>Kung Fu Klan,</i> <i>Black Wolves,</i> <i>Azewa,</i> <i>Black Faces,</i> and <i>Black Démolition.</i>
These are not translations   &mdash;   they are the actual names of African
gangs, and show the cachet of sounding American. Influence does not
flow the other way; no black American gang would call itself <i>Les Serpents Noirs,</i> for example. </p>
        <p> In 2001, a gang with the unlikely name of <i>Les Japonais</i>
(The Japanese) made a brief bid for power. Two of its members made a
spectacular haul when they grabbed a briefcase with more than three
million Euros from a businessman who had just made a bank withdrawal.
They pulled off the job right under a security camera, so were quickly
identified and caught. No one seems to know why they called themselves <i>Les Japonais,</i> and they were soon eclipsed. </p>
        <p>
The gangs tend to be organized around an individual strong man who
recruits members from ages 13 to 20. As in the mafia, when the head of
a gang is arrested, an underage member comes forward to take the rap,
because a minor will not see much jail time. Often the youngest gang
members are the most reckless. </p>
        <p> The true record of the havoc <i>Black Démolition</i>
and other Congolese gangs have wreaked on Belgian society lies
somewhere in the confidential records of the police. Occasionally, if
the victim is elderly or treated in a particularly horrible way, the
crime may make its way into the papers, but the names of the
perpetrators are generally left out. Obviously African names would give
the wrong impression, after all, so it takes some sleuthing for
outsiders to get a grasp of the extent of black crime. </p>
        <p>
Gang violence is by no means limited to attacks on hapless Belgians who
are at the wrong place at the wrong time, that is to say when a
Congolese decides he wants to make a few Euros without having to work
for them. Among themselves, and especially with rival gang members,
these African predators show little sentiment. Punishment of traitors
and settling of scores can lead to spectacular and bloody encounters.
Here are some of the incidents from about a six-month period that did
manage to make the papers. </p>
        <table class="quoteright">
          <tbody><tr>
            <th> Today there are many gangs with colorful names: <i>Kung Fu Klan,</i> <i>Black Wolves,</i> <i>Azewa,</i> <i>Black Faces,</i> and <i>Black Démolition.</i> </th>

        </tbody></table>
        <p> One evening in October 2001, Andy Djimbo gets off the streetcar at Berchem-Staine-Agathe and sights a few members of <i>Black Démolition.</i> This is a worry because his people   &mdash;   he is a <i>New Jack</i>   &mdash;   have already had some warm encounters with <i>Black Démolition.</i>
He makes a quick call on his cell phone to a buddy who promises to come
for him right away. He takes off down Avenue des Myrthes, but his
enemies catch up with him. They have sticks and knives, and proceed to
beat him. For extra fun, one takes out a gun and holds it to his head.
His friend shows up in a car just in time, and Mr. Djimbo makes a break
for it. He jumps into the car, which takes off like a shot, but <i>Black Démolition</i>
is not to be left empty-handed. The men chase the car all the way to
Rue Potaerdegat, and one fires three shots, hitting Mr. Djimbo in the
leg and shoulder. </p>
        <p> The <i>Black Démolition </i>contingent
  &mdash;   all 18 of them   &mdash;   hop on a passing bus in the hope of making a
getaway, but the police are already after them. A quick search turns up
chains and baseball bats. The firearm is found under the seat of
Fabrice Dimbala. It is not to be forgotten that this is Belgium, where
no one is allowed to own a handgun, and people do not spray city
streets with bullets. </p>
        <p> Just a few weeks later, on Jan. 11, 2002, there is another revenge attack, this time by <i>Les Black Wolves</i>,a juvenile gang that is a kind of subcontractor for <i>Black Démolition.</i> Some of its boys attack 16-year-old Cedric, a member of a rival gang called <i>Black Pite.</i> They stab him at Galerie d&rsquo;Ixelles, and leave him for dead in a pool of blood. </p>
        <p> The next month <i>Black Démolition</i>
pulls off a particularly rococo stunt. On a late afternoon, six of its
members show up at number 196 Avenue Dailly and go up to an apartment
on the fourth floor. They persuade 20-year-old Christophe to open the
door (he is to this day close-mouthed about why <i>Black Démolition</i>
sought his society that day), whereupon they tie him up and beat him
with an iron rod. It appears that they are seeking information. They
threaten to kill him, and finally drag him out to the balcony of the
apartment. The downstairs neighbor hears screaming and opens the
shutters. There, before his astonished eyes, is young Christophe,
hanging from a rope in mid air. </p>
        <p> That same month, the
wife of the president of Central African Republic pays a visit to
Galerie d&rsquo;Ixelles in the company of the wife of the Central African
ambassador. A <i>Black Démolition</i> stalwart takes a swing at them
with a sword. As it happens, the ladies have a body guard, who puts up
a stiff resistance, but the brouhaha brings out about 10 members of <i>Black Démolition</i> who give chase. The three Central Africans manage to take refuge in the Hotel Conrad. The police make one arrest. </p>
        <p> There is more to come at Galerie d&rsquo;Ixelles. On March 22, 2002, <i>Black Démolition</i>
rubs out one of its own members suspected of being a spy for a rival
gang. The murder weapon is a fondue fork. The police pick up one of the
killers two months later. They are already acquainted with Yannick,
also known as Erwynn, who likes to spook the police by removing his
glass eye and leering at them with an empty socket. Another killer
happens to be the swordsman who attacked the ladies, but he is not
caught until September, when he shows up in Switzerland. A third stays
on the lam until December when he, too, is rounded up in Switzerland. </p>

        <p> But <i>Black Démolition</i>
really makes a name for itself on May 16. That day, thousands of
Belgians throng Rue Neuve, the busiest shopping street in the capital.
Unbeknownst to them, <i>Black Démolition</i> and <i>New Jack</i> are fighting over who will control the drug trade in the area. Alain Ndakoze and Lutahe Okundji, both of <i>Black Démolition,</i> are killing time on Rue Neuve when they catch sight of several <i>New Jacks.</i> Mr. Ndakoze decides to set up an ambush for them, but the <i>New Jacks</i> are too quick for him. Andy Djimbo, the gentleman who just a few months before stopped two <i>Black Démolition</i>
bullets, pulls out a .32 caliber pistol and shoots Mr. Okundji in the
leg. He then empties his pistol wildly into the crowd. Susan McDonald,
a 24-year-old British tourist is hit in the leg. Panayotis D., a
21-year-old Greek living in Brussels, is seriously wounded, also in the
leg, and is rushed to the hospital. Twenty-four-year-old Bechir D.,
visiting from Schaerbeek, is grazed by a bullet, and Andres B. from
Anderlecht, age 29, is hit in the thigh. Miraculously, no one is
killed. </p>
        <p> In the panic that ensues, Mr. Ndakoze leaps
on Mr. Djimbo and takes his weapon, then hustles off with his bleeding
comrade, Mr. Okundji. The police show up promptly, however, so he
ditches the gun. The gunman is quickly taken into custody. The very
next day, Congolese are out in force on the Rue Neuve, but so are the
police. There is no more gunplay. </p>
        <p> <b>Back in the Congo</b> </p>
        <p>
One is struck by certain similarities between the behavior of African
gangs and that of the armed gangs devastating the Eastern Congo.
Particuarly in the province of Iturie, killers give themselves fancy
names, and it is the <i>Effaceurs</i> (Obliterators) who run things.
Although they pretend to give it some kind of vague political
justification, they have a habit of indiscriminate rape: men, women,
children, grandmothers, babies. Anyone who makes it though the
hair-raising reports Amnesty International sends back from the Congo
begins to wonder why the militias bother to wear trousers when they are
on maneuvers. </p>
        <p> <i>Black Démolition</i> has something
of a reputation in this line, too. On the night of November 16, 2001   &mdash;  
during the same period discussed previously   &mdash;   Augustin Pasi, Trésor
Mutamba and Philippe Nguwa Wukendi sidled up to a girl of 16 (race
unspecified) waiting for the train at the Louvain la Neuve Station.
They talked her into following them to student quarters where they put
a knife to her throat and proceeded to spend the night raping her. Mr.
Pasi is something of a serial rapist. On the night of Nov. 18, 2000, he
and three other Africans met three girls (again, race unspecified) at a
snack bar, and managed to get them into an apartment. Once inside, all
four systematiclly raped all three. This was not long after a group of
nine <i>Black Démolition</i> members talked a girl of 15 off the streets of Antwerp, and took turns raping and sodomizing her. </p>
        <table class="boxleft">

        </tbody></table>
        <p> All is fair in love and war. In February 2002, a girl who was having a drink with <i>Black Démolition</i>
suddenly lost consciousness   &mdash;   knock-out drops in her drink   &mdash;   and came
to only to find herself tied to a kitchen table in a strange apartment,
where several Africans had their way with her. </p>
        <p> Being
the girlfriend of a gang member is no protection. On the night of March
2, 2002, Fabrice Dimbala left the Gala discotheque with his 18-year-old
companion. She had had enough for the evening and wanted to go home.
This infuriated Mr. Dimbala, who decided to teach her a lesson. He
invited Magatte Kobi, David Bakupa and Bayazi Mbuyi to come along with
him to help mete out discipline, which he began by breaking one of her
teeth with a vodka bottle. They spent the rest of the evening beating
and raping her. </p>
        <p> For <i>Black Démolition,</i> 2002
was The Year of the Woman. On August 13, seven members abducted a woman
and spirited her off to an apartment in Rue Fontaine in Brussels, where
they spent the night raping her. The next morning, when the young
victim thought her tortures were over, the men bundled her into a car,
drove her to the town of Charleroi, and started on her again. The woman
did not manage to escape until three days later. This is not unusual. <i>Black Démolition</i> likes to keep women for days on end, and makes them do the cleaning when they are not otherwise occupied. </p>
        <p>
Belgian women are sadly ignorant of what they are up against. On April
19, 2003, our friend Fabrice Dimbala was out with pals in the Porte de
Hal area and decided to snatch a handbag. The young owner, hoping to
get her things back, followed them into a side street where they turned
on her, dragged her into an apartment, and raped her. </p>
        <p> It was around the same time that <i>Black Démolition</i>
began branching out from rape and street crime, and started to ply its
trade outside the capital. In December, Bely Tshimanga, Fabrice
Okitundu and Luc Gillissen went to the town of Machelen where they
visited a Pizza Hut. They helped themselves to the contents of the cash
register and quickly disappeared. By the time the employees realized
what had happened, <i>Black Démolition</i> was already on the road to Evère, where they arrived 40 minutes later and knocked over another Pizza Hut. </p>
        <p>
Later that month, four gang members cruised into the town of Nivelle in
a stolen automobile. They were broke and needed cash. About noon, armed
and hooded, they burst into an electronics store called Draime
Electronic. One gang member held a knife to the throat of the store
manager while another kicked a customer violently in the stomach. The
gang dragged the two to the back of the store and tied them up, while
they brandished weapons at the other customers. <i>Black Démolition</i>
collected wallets, cell phones, car radios, DVD readers, and 2,055
Euros from the cash registers, and roared off in the store manger&rsquo;s
Ford. </p>
        <p> Still in December, the day after Christmas,
six or seven members attacked a take-out restaurant in Waterloo. They
beat the woman behind the counter, emptied the till, and tried to make
her open the safe. She stalled for time and they panicked, leaving with
only the 650 Euros from the cash register. </p>

        </tbody></table>
        <p> The next day, December 27, <i>Black Démolition</i>
arrived at Berchem-Sainte-Agathe. Two members reached into a car at a
stop light, and stole purses from two women. An auxiliary police
officer witnessed the crime and put out an alert. The next day, police
saw the perpetrators back in Brussels in a car with French plates and
went after them. <i>Black Démolition</i> escaped after a wild,
high-speed chase through the streets of Brussels in which,
miraculously, no one was hurt. Once again, Belgians were treated to
sights heretofore seen only in American movies. On January 9, 2003, the
gang robbed a gas station in the town of Lasne, drove to Overijse and
hit another gas station. </p>
        <p> In April of 2004, <i>Black Démolition</i>
moved on to bigger things when two of its members abducted an executive
in the Brussels office of the Congolese diamond mining company, Minière
de Bakwanga. They were acting on orders of Jean-Charles Otoko, a former
Congolese foreign minister and former officer of the company. He is
suspected of having stolen $80 million from the firm, $20 million of
which he spent on weapons in Ukraine and the Czech Republic to get
around the arms embargo on the Congo. The remaining $60 million are
thought to have come to rest in private Congolese hands. The abduction
appears to have been some murky score-settling. </p>
        <p> The
petty thugs from Galerie d&rsquo;Ixelles had, it seemed, come to the
attention of highly-placed Congolese officials who seem to have
discovered kindred spirits on whom they could rely for certain delicate
operations. </p>

The police are finally putting some of these criminals behind bars. In
February 2004 they caught up with the men who went on the year-end tear
in 2002, in which they hit Pizza Huts and gas stations all over
Belgium. Sentencing standards are far different in Belgium than in the
United States: Of the seven defendants, one got seven years, but
several got off with just three. </p>
        <p> In March 23, 2004, it was Bely Tshimanga-Kazadi&rsquo;s turn. This 20-year-old <i>Black Démolition</i>
veteran, in the dock in Brussels along with a dozen confederates, was
charged with seven rapes. Six of his victims were minors; one was just
13. He was also up for a car-jacking and several holdups. When the time
came for the accused, in accordance with Belgian law, to speak for
himself, Mr. Tshimanga glared at the judge, a woman, and explained: </p>
        <blockquote>
&#8220;The police are always coming around Porte de Namur looking for blacks.
But it&rsquo;s not just blacks who like group sex. Whites and Asians do too,
and in my case it was all consensual. Group sex may seem strange to
you, Your Honor, but you&rsquo;re just too old to understand. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t
have to rape to have sex. I&rsquo;m plenty good-looking enough to find a
woman.&#8221; </blockquote>

        <p>
As the judge begins to read the sentence, Mr. Tshimanga exploded. He
shot out of his chair screaming, and threw himself at the judge. The
police were on him in an instant, but it took a ferocious struggle to
control him. Everyone in the courtroom thought peace had been restored,
but at the first opportunity, Mr. Tshimanga went on the offensive
again. This time all the other <i>Black Démolition</i> members erupted
with him, lashing out at whoever was handy. The women in the courtroom
were frozen in terror   &mdash;   they had heard what these men were capable of   &mdash;  
while the defense lawyers, who had spent enough time with their clients
to get to know them, fled for safety. The blacks started swinging
chairs and benches. Fifteen more officers rushed to the courtroom,
where there was a general melee. Order was finally restored, and <i>Black Démolition</i>
got its sentences: ten years for Bely Tshimanga and Magatte Kobi, eight
for Stefan Ngueudong, Guélor Litanda, Andry Bandazio, David Bakupa, and
Bazayi Mbuyi, seven years for Lutahe Okundji, Frederic Kani, and Yves
Mbena, six years for Prince Lusungi and Fabrice Okitundu, five years
for Frederic Kani and Kaseba Kabamba. </p>
        <p> As they are marched out of court, one of the men shouted, &#8220;We&rsquo;ll see you in hell and then you&rsquo;ll pay!&#8221; </p>
        <p> Fabrice Dimbala, who was finally sentenced in January 2005, has been part of our story from the beginning. He was the <i>Black Démolition</i>
member under whose seat on the bus was found the pistol used to blaze
away at the unfortunate Mr. Djimbo. It was he who decided to teach his
girlfriend a lesson when she wanted to go home rather than keep the
party going, and he was also one of the purse-snatchers who raped the
victim when she tried to get her property back. He was up for two gang
rapes and three attempted murders, and got 13 years in prison. His
lawyers were shocked. &#8220;A jail sentence must have some meaning and must
lead to rehabilitation, but in this case the punishment is
incomprehensible,&#8221; said one. &#8220;This is why we will undoubtedly appeal.&#8221; </p>
        <p>
Mr. Dimbala is one of these black criminals who fascinate liberal
journalists, Belgian and American alike. The young thug was apparently
a first-rate soccer player. He had already made a name for himself in a
first-division amateur league, and was a sure bet for spot on a pro
team. &#8220;Only 19 and facing 13 years in prison,&#8221; moaned the press. &#8220;What
a waste. What could have driven him to crime?&#8221; What, indeed? </p>

In May 2004, no less a personage than Nicole Maréchal, Belgian cabinet
minister for Aid to Youth, was at Galerie d&rsquo;Ixelles to hear young
Congolese speak for themselves. She heard that Congolese parents don&rsquo;t
do enough for their children, but that ultimately the fault lies with
the Belgians. There are no positive black role models in Belgium as
there are in France or the United States, and blacks are society&rsquo;s
chosen victims. &#8220;Most of us,&#8221; said one Congolese, &#8220;feel that whichever
way this country is going, it is going without us. We are the fall guys
in this country, and the government doesn&rsquo;t do for us the things it
does for other immigrant groups.&#8221; And that, the young Congolese
explained, was why they join gangs. They crave a thousand things they
cannot afford, and fall under the influence of Africans older than
themselves who are already completely alienated from Belgian society. </p>
        <p> <b>White Demolition</b> </p>
        <p> It would be a mistake, of course, to suppose that <i>Black Démolition</i>
is a problem unique to Brussels. There have been extremely violent
gangs in France for more than a decade, and they have appeared whenever
immigration from Africa reached a certain level. In Switzerland, where
the murderers of Okito Djunga took refuge, Africans are heavily
involved in the drug trade. In Quebec, increasingly active gangs of
blacks terrorize the population. Nor is the problem limited to
French-speaking countries. In London, black gangs are such a problem
that Trevor Phillips, the black head of the Commission for Racial
Equality, recently suggested that black boys be put in separate classes
(see May issue.) </p>
        <p> In the United States, of course,
the theory has always been that black gangs of super-predators were the
fruit of centuries of slavery and prejudice, but 40 years of racial
preferences have not brought notable improvement. In Europe, where
blacks have immigrated voluntarily, they find themselves in exactly the
same situation and are clamoring for the full panoply of quotas and
preferences. </p>
        <p> In Africa itself one finds even worse
gangs. Contrary to all predictions, the end of Apartheid in South
Africa has not led to peace but to an explosion of violence of all
kinds. In Congo, Liberia, Angola, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, and
Rwanda, armed gangs in a state of alleged civil war prey on civilians
as much as they fight each other. The black gangs in Belgium, with
their violence and sadism, are a kind of social constant independent of
geography or social or historical circumstances. It could have been
predicted with complete confidence that they would appear once the
African population reached a certain number. </p>
        <p> Why,
then, have Belgian politicians   &mdash;   like politicians in all European
countries   &mdash;   been unable to take the bull by the horns, to stop this
immigration, and protect their populations from predation? At least in
the case of Muslims, the events of September 11 forced even the most
deluded optimists to see that throughout Europe, these people do not
want to assimilate; they want to rule. </p>
        <p> It is perhaps
with blacks that the European elite maintains, to some degree, a
genuinely colonialist mentality. Our rulers came of age when there were
still African empires, and when Europeans still claimed their goal was
to civilize the savage. Politicians today seem to think they can go the
previous generation one better: If civilization could not be brought to
Africa, they can bring Africans to Europe and make them into good
little Belgians and Frenchmen. What we now see before our eyes   &mdash;   in the
streets, on public transport, in the crime figures   &mdash;   is proof that
Africans do not become Belgians or Frenchmen. It is when they are in
gangs that they most brutally assert their differences from us, but the
gangs themselves are only the tip of a huge iceberg of irreconcilable
differences that our elites   &mdash;   blinded by Eurocentrism   &mdash;   are determined
to ignore. </p>

        <p> Of course, our elites, just like the Communist <i>nomenklatura</i>
who insulated themselves from the realities of the worker&rsquo;s paradise,
are indifferent to the destruction of European society because they can
escape its consequences. The French Socialist politician Lionel Jospin
is a perfect example. For years, he preached multiculturalism and
promoted full-bore immigration. When he finally withdrew from politics
in 2002 after an unsuccessful run for the presidency, he did not retire
to a mixed-race neighborhood of the kind he did so much to bring about.
He doesn&rsquo;t even live on the French mainland, but on a chic little
island called Ile de Ré off the coast, in the Bay of Biscay. No
non-white neighbors for him. </p>
        <p> The Africans of <i>Black Démolition</i>
are responsible for their crimes, but they are not responsible for
having committed them in Belgium. Others   &mdash;   Belgians   &mdash;   are responsible
for that. It is the politicians, the intellectuals, and the media
personalities who are to blame. They are members of a far more
dangerous gang: <i>White Démolition</i>. </p>
        <p> <b>Déjà Vu</b> </p>
        <p>
The Belgian authorities do not seem to have noticed that what they are
going through very much resembles the 1960s and 1970s in the United
States. That was when crime rates   &mdash;   among blacks in particular   &mdash;   began
to soar, and there was no shortage of theories about how society was to
blame. Jail sentences were short because prison was for rehabilitation.
It took 20 years before Americans learned that the only thing that
rehabilitates career criminals is old age, and that the best thing to
do is simply keep them away from the rest of us. Now that most states
have stiff sentencing guidelines, we have a larger prison population,
but crime rates have been dropping for a decade. </p>
        <p> The sentences the Belgian courts have handed out to <i>Black Démolition</i>
thugs are jokes by American standards. The lawyers for Mr. Dimbala, the
soccer prodigy, were shocked when their client got 13 years for two
gang rapes and three attempted murders. An American court would
probably have given him 30 years to life. We are certainly capable of
unlearning our lessons, but Americans have had their fill of
catch-and-release. </p>
        <p> The Belgian view of crime is
typical of all-white, European societies. The country has traditionally
had violent crime rates one third to one quarter of those in the United
States. It has had the occasional sensational crime, but is not
accustomed to the casual brutality and indifference to suffering that
characterize many black criminals. It is only now discovering the
horrible things of which certain 12 and 13-year-olds are capable, and
has not yet adjusted its juvenile code. Many American states now
prosecute child-pimps and child-murderers as adults. </p>
        <p>
If Belgians do not stop the flow of immigrants, they will be forced
through the same, painful adjustment as the United States. It remains
to be seen whether they will recognize in time that <i>Black Démolition</i>
does not reflect inadequacies of Belgian society but results from the
presence of Africans in a civilization built by Europeans.<!-- #bbinclude "textend.incl" -->

		<p>I just returned from Brussels today.  How funny that this article should appear.</p>
<p>My thoughts were &#8220;What a nice Christmas scene they set up downtown near the Grand Place.&#8221; Then I saw numerous little shops and kiosks manned by blacks.  In fact, there blacks all over the city.  </p>

		<p>When people move to a new land they always bring much of their old land with them.</p>
<p>When English people arrived in what is now America they brought so much of England with them that we still call a large section of our nation New England. Germans brought the ways of Germany and the French brought the ways of France. The same with Finlanders, Swedes, Poles and Czechs. Everyone brings some of where they&rsquo;ve been to where they&rsquo;re going. That is natural and completely predictable.</p>
<p>So why is it that everyone is surprised that when you bring a bunch of uncivilized, constantly warring, low IQ murderers and rapists into their country the crime rate goes up. How hard is it to look at people in their homelands and decide if you want some of that in your back yard? </p>
<p>I truly believe that many of the people responsible for immigration policies in western nations are motivated by some kind of deviate sexual compulsion. Something like whatever it is that drives a rich White TV evangelist to go slumming for Black crack whores.</p>
<p>It has to be something like that. There is no rational reason for bringing violent, troublesome third-worlders into a civilized country, so the reason has to be something irrational, such as a weird sexual attraction.</p>

		<p>A question for European readers:  how do your people perceive the situation?  Is there shock and dismay over the level of violence? Are you prepared to defend yourselves? </p>
<p>I do not think it is much of a surprise to Americans to see this sort of violent crime activity. At the same time, in the USA we have the Second Amendment (right to bear arms) which gives the average citizen a modicum of self-defense should they so choose to exercise it.  And in more recent decades, the USA has implemented various &#8220;wars&#8221; on crime which have jailed large numbers of violent criminals (a large percentage of which are black, but that simply reflects who is committing these crimes). </p>
<p>Of course, the wars on crime have been at some cost to civil liberties.  And often innocent people are railroaded.  But these brute force methods do seem to have gotten things under some sort of control.</p>
<p>Anyway, how shocked are Europeans by the kinds of crime reported in this article?  Did you expect these crimes to happen?  Did you expect to peacefully assimilate third world immigrants?  Is there a culture shock here?</p>
<p>And are you considering rethinking your law enforcement policies? </p>
<p>I think one of the first things that needs to be done is have an international right to bear arms.  Not only to defend oneself against crime, but to defend all of one&rsquo;s rights. </p>

		<p>Poor Brussels, once a great European city, soon lost to this third world masses who will quickly transform it into a wasteland. Good-bye beautiful city hello slums and destruction of every architectural wonder within its limits.</p>
<p>These African masses will not become Europeans, because it is impossible, they will simply turn Europe into Africa, the same way our ancestors turned North America into Europe, except the latter usually implies improvement.<br>

<p>Agreed. But Brussels is far worse.  Doubtless this is the backwash from the Congo. Belgium is paying a heavy price now for all that rubber and bananas, coffee and tin, which turned out to be NOT so cheap after all!</p>
<p>In addition to the Congolese blacks, Brussels has the Moroccans and other kinds of Moslems to contend with.</p>
<p>But the lofty elites there are as out-of-touch and indifferent as those here.  When I was there last year, I stayed in what&rsquo;s called &#8220;the European District&#8221;   &mdash;   the headquarters of the European Union. Hardly a black face was to be seen anywhere!

<p>I urge you to reconsider! Be less pessimistic. The city of Paris is not so dangerous as you seem to think. (Though it&rsquo;s  admittedly more so than it used to be.) The Africans and Arabs are largely confined to the suburbs outside the city. The crime level depends on where you are. Same with rioting. The central areas, the tourist attractions, are still beautiful and safe. Let your children see them NOW, while they still can. In ten years, it may be very different.</p>
<p>Paris is a jewel and one of the repositories of Western civilization. It is still safe, beautiful, and is not to be missed. Your children will NOT see &#8220;the same thing&#8221; in any &#8220;Amerikan&#8221; city. Nor, indeed, in any other other city   &mdash;   anywhere! <br>

		<p><i>&#8220;There are no positive black role models in Belgium as there are in France or the United States, and blacks are society&rsquo;s chosen victims.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The same old canard of Black victim mentality is regularly aired here in France. So, no, there are no &#8220;positive black role models&#8221; in France.</p>
<p>Not that Blacks try very hard to extract some from their ranks.</p>
<p>I once witnessed a sort of &#8220;Black pride&#8221; march in the middle of Paris, probably heavily subsidised by the city council. There was a large group of bongo &#8220;players&#8221;, naked to the waist, wearing only grass skirts, furiously thumping on their &#8220;instruments&#8221; for hours on end.</p>
<p>In other words, a colonial and &#8220;racist&#8221; stereotype.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the &#8220;positive role models&#8221; Blacks give themselves when they have full liberty to do so.</p>

		<p>If you want to destroy sovereign European nation states by assimilating them into the EUSSR then the native populations would probably resist. If, however, you import millions on 3rd worlders from African or Islamic countries, these millions will have no loyalty to their new homelands beyond what their socialist politicians have promised them in welfare payments. </p>
<p>They will, however, have a vote and citizenship equal to any native whose family has lived there for generations. You combine this with ingratitude and hostility from the incomers towards the natives, add a dumbed down education system and distract the masses with trash TV and&hellip;Voila, the destruction of aforementioned sovereign nation states is assured.</p>

		<p>One has to wonder what sort of derangement overcomes the population of a wonderfully civilized nation such as Belgium, granting nearly open access to black Africans.</p>
<p>This is a racial group that has destroyed every vestige of civilization it&rsquo;s touched, every neighborhood, every village, every town, every city, country, state or country in which their numbers reach a critical mass, which appears to be a remarkably low concentration.  There are no exceptions to this pattern, not one.  </p>
<p>The pathetic island of Haiti is perhaps the most noteworthy example in our hemisphere.  Having slaughtered the French colonists in the early 19th Century, they&rsquo;re still stuck in a nightmarish African society, barbaric, poverty-stricken, ignorant, lacking adequate medical care, violent crime everywhere, no GDP to speak of, etc.</p>
<p>Sounds rather a lot like several neighborhoods in certain American cities, all of which live off the foolish paternalism of the majority population, which all the while continues to pretend to search for the &#8220;root causes&#8221; of black failure, criminality, immorality, and inability to adapt to the requirements of the modern world.</p>
<p>I would ask the Belgians, &#8220;Are you people out of your minds?&#8221;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no accident, but they&rsquo;re not insane. One has to understand that, historically, Communism has been very powerful and deep-rooted in Belgium. Brussels was used by such as Marx, Engels and Heine as a base from which to spread revolution in Europe. Brussels is also the headquarters of the world Socialist International. </p>
<p>Internationalism (hence racial egalitariamism) has always been a fundamental, non-negotiable,  principle of Marxism.  You can&rsquo;t be a good Marxist without being an anti-nationalist and anti-racist. </p>

for example, in hte past 10 years, my coworkers have gone from 95% white, to 50% african muslims, 25% africans, etc.<br>
