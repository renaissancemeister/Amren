<h1>Tangled: A Celebration of White Femininity</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Womanist Musings, November 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><cite>Tangled</cite> is Disney&rsquo;s version of Rapunzel. </p>
<p>{Snip}</p>
<p> I think it is no accident that Rapunzel was added to the Disney stable of princesses, right after Disney finally got around to creating their first African American princess.</p>
<p>As a Black woman, I know all to well how complicated the issue of hair can be. Looking at the above image, I found that I could not see beyond her long blond hair and blue eyes. I believe that this will also become the focal point of many girls of colour. The standard of long flowing blond hair as the epitome of femininity necessarily excludes and challenges the idea that WOC are feminine, desired, and some cases loved and therefore, while Disney is creating an image of Rapunzel that we are accustomed to, her rebirth in a modern day context is problematic, because her body represents the celebration of White femininity.</p>
<p>The world is anything but equal and this is evidenced by what bodies we choose to celebrate and what bodies we choose either to denigrate or ignore. Each day that a little White girl turns on the television, or opens a book, she can see multiple representations of White Womanhood. In of itself, Rapunzel is not problematic, but in a world in which natural Black kinky hair is seen as unkept and downright ugly, Rapunzel amounts to a slap in the face. It tells little girls of color that they will never be beautiful, because they were born without the characteristics that are normal to White womanhood.</p>
<p>The fact that <cite>Tangled</cite> is coming on the heels of the first African American princess is indeed problematic. It makes Princess Tiana seem like an impotent token, with Rapunzel appearing to reset the standard of what princess means and even more precisely what womanhood means.</p>
<p>{Snip}</p>
<p>The Disney princess series is absolutely problematic in the harmful messages that it sends young girls, but I venture to say that its treatment of race compounds the dissonance of worth and value that little Black girls live with everyday. </p>
<p>{Snip}</p>

		<p>What a pathetic article! This woman cannot get past her own &#8220;blackness&#8221; and is upset by a blonde cartoon character. White women whose hair is not the socially desired shade of blonde will often spend hundreds of dollars on bleaching with additional hundreds of dollars in corrective measures such as hot oil and special conditioners to control the damage that bleaching causes. Black women tend to complain about the money that they spend on their hair to make it straighter and therefore &#8220;whiter&#8221; looking and tend to hate on White women for having straight hair. In parts of Africa that have not had much contact with Europeans straight hair and finer features are considered more beautiful than the courser African hair and features. Ayaan Hirsi Ali&rsquo;s book about leaving Islam had several incidents mentioning this- Ayaan&rsquo;s older twin sisters had long hair that could be pulled back into buns but Ayaan had the African hair that grew outward from her head. During her school years Ayaan lived in both Saudi Arabia as well as Kenya and in both these countries- non European and non Western- she was judged for her looks. In Saudi Arabia (one of the most racist countries in the world BTW) the Africans were called &#8220;abeed&#8221; which means both black and slave- and in Kenya the Somalis tended to stay away from the blacker Kenyans- calling them &#8220;the slaves&#8221;. Long story short it is not so much European standards but universal beauty standards. </p>

<p>Whites invented television and the printing press for our exclusive use. The fact that an African would view them and be offended was never considered in their invention.</p>
<p>Africans should be more reflective on their good fortune. Without white communication tools, they&rsquo;d be drawing in the dirt with a stick.</p>

<p>But I thought we were supposed to &#8220;celebrate diversity?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Each day that a little White girl turns on the television, or opens a book, she can see multiple representations of White Womanhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>A majority of those representations include pairing them with black men.  Now the fix is to remove white women altogether because they are too beautiful?</p>
<p>&hellip;&#8221;framing them in a manner that specifically harms girls of color by celebrating Whiteness as the ultimate example of femininity must end.&#8221;</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the giveaway; Any thing that is extraordinary, such as white beauty, must be suppressed, even eliminated, because it makes more people feel bad.  This is nothing less than a call for extermination of whites.</p>
<p>This article is a good bit of evidence for the argument that Multiculturalism is a lie and that it and the word Diversity, are code words for white genocide.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, Whites are an evil, undeserving, racist race that needs to be eliminated.  Whites should not have their own songs, history, TV shows, communities, clubs and associations, houses of worship, nation, fables, myths, and fairy tails.  NO!  Everything that Whites do, must be for and about People of Color.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, there is no such thing as race.  However, all races (except Whites), must have their own songs, history, TV shows, communities, clubs and associations, houses of worship, nations, fables, myths, and fairy tails.  Do you understand now?  Good! Now Shut up, get back to work, and pay your taxes. </p>

		<p>Can the beauty of European people no longer be celebrated in the name of equality? What about the young Euro-American children who see images of &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; non-whites? Where is their encouragement? They keep talking about white people on everything as if though it is a supply that cannot be stressed, like an unending fountain of beautiful white people.</p>
<p>When we become a minority, will we be able to portray ourselves without complaint? Will it be the day when it is rare to see someone with a hair color other than black or skin lighter than &ldquo;mocha&rdquo;? </p>
<p>The problem for many black women is that they try to emulate a white woman, that is impossible so rather than trying to enjoy their own beauty, they go to damaging lengths to try to appear of European blood. Emulating other races is unnatural and it is unhealthy as it is a state that cannot be reached. Each race has its own beauty, but that beauty is often for the people of that race, this is where multi-racial societies can be problematic, as standards (and abilities) vary greatly.  More and more, it seems to me that races are simply not able to exist alongside each other in a mixed stew. </p>
<p><br>
Yes, the white race is beautiful, but if these black women ever want to function on their own, they will simply have to accept themselves as they are. <br>

		<p>Disney isn&rsquo;t a philanthropist organization.  They exist to make money.  Black does not sell.  Disney HAS become more and more just another propaganda arm for the multicult fantasy and the progressive agenda, however they do so at a loss.  In order to KEEP putting out loss generating propaganda, they have to more often than not produce something that most folks would want to buy or view.  In short, black entitlement rears it&rsquo;s head again, but when does it ever sleep, really?  And whose fault is that?  OURS.  For paying any attention to the ravings of the forever disgruntled, hands out, demanding blacks.  Long ago we should have treated each and every such rant or whine with a standard hearty belly laugh followed by a &#8220;take a hike.  Ain&rsquo;t gonna happen&#8221;.  Typical black gratitude though&hellip;.those corporations who DO try to appease blacks find they can NEVER appease blacks.  Make a black doll and it isn&rsquo;t black enough.  Make it black enough, and they are told &#8220;it&rsquo;s ugly and racist&#8221;.  Same with film and cartoon corporations.  Whatever is done, is never enough nor good enough.  It will not stop until we tell blacks to start their OWN corporations, make their OWN dolls, produce their OWN films and cartoons.  Otherwise, sit down and shut up.</p>

<p>Whether little girls make their observations at a movie theater or at the mall, they will believe what their eyes tell them. Would the author of those wasted words have been happier if Disney had made their Rapunzel-like character look like Weezy Jefferson or some other KFC Princess?</p>

		<p>Long ago, but not too far away (actually, it was SoCal in the early eighties), I heard an interview of Bananarama on ROTR. Rodney asked the lasses if they had seen the Waitresses&rsquo; (shrill feminist punk band) show, at some local venue. The girls scoffed at their sisters-in-music, likening their performance to that of fat, ugly school girls  &mdash;  all loud and feminist.</p>
<p>Same here, just add blackface, and the typical racial anger found when non-whites write about us in partisan journals.</p>

<p>Hey, I&rsquo;ve got a great idea for you: the white and black worlds can create their own heroes and heroines. That way, each society can mold its fictional characters the way it sees fit. Of course, that is not what blacks want, nor what they have ever wanted. They have always wanted to impinge themselves into white society and entertainment. </p>
<p>Not only that, but after imposing themselves on whites, they then want to call the shots and dictate exactly how and in what proportions they are represented, demanding an ever-increasing share for themselves until whites are crowded out entirely. That is why the &#8220;integration of entertainment&#8221; is ultimately doomed to failure.</p>
<p>Anything that is held up as desirable will leave some people out. The idealization of the muscular physique will leave out the scrawny, the valuing of slimness will exclude the overweight; valuing intelligence will exclude the less intelligent, preferring extroversion will leave out introverts, etc. </p>
<p><i>The Disney princess series is absolutely problematic in the harmful messages that it sends young girls, but I venture to say that its treatment of race compounds the dissonance of worth and value that little Black girls live with everyday. I believe as women, we would all be better off if the genre simply disappeared</i></p>
<p>Yes, if a genre of entertainment doesn&rsquo;t include enough blacks, it should simply be abolished. That says it all.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the movie with my 10 year old daughter. She has long brown hair. I must admit that I was very happy to see a white movie. After all, black culture is being force fed on white children. Watching TV shows and commercials I see over and over young attractive white women interacting with black men. You almost never see black women with white men. Why cant people be left to enjoy themselves without worrying about everybodies feelings. In my opinion there is nothing more attractive in this world then a blue eyed blonde. Black men should feel that way about women of color. </p>

<p>The fact is anything that white people hold dear or like about themselves is &#8220;problematic&#8221; to blacks. In their never-ending war on white self esteem, in their endless jealous rage at the fact that they are not white, anything that whites do, or say, or hold dear is &#8220;problematic&#8221; to blacks. They will never let up on this. Get used to it white people, or stand up to them, defy them, show their rage for what it is - plain old jealous envy at what they can&rsquo;t have or ever be. It&rsquo;s not their fault or ours (white peoples&rsquo; that is) it&rsquo;s just the way it is. They need to get over it!</p>

		<p>&#8220;I know all to (sic) well how complicated the issue of hair can be.&#8221;  Yes, I believe that the Cato Institute employs six full-time scholars for its study now.  As one who likes to watch the ponies run, I resent any woman who aspires to thoroughbred, equine beauty by describing herself as part of a &#8220;stable.&#8221;  Indeed, when last in Walmart, I saw many women, some African American who (sans makeup) looked a bit like mules.  (That is no insult but statement of fact, Editor.)  Women of this visage would do well to learn cooking or to bear in mind William Blake&rsquo;s assertion that the lust of the goat is the glory of God.  Methinks, the lady doth bray too much.  Men of my mature years are well aware that, except for a small number of white girls and Sophia Loren, all women are enforced by necessity to &#8220;paint the barn.&#8221;</p>

		<p>My wife is SE Asian and I am real dark, so I originally tried to find dolls that resembled our daughter&rsquo;s brunette hair. My wife said to give it up as she and the daughter preferred blond hair dolls. When I explained my reasoning, they both laughed at me and wondered where such a dumb idea came from. So, we have Disney Princess articles all over the house, but the Arabic Jasmine is only a small part, as my daughter prefers the blond ones. My daughter is outgrowing dolls, but it is funny how hard I tried to instill lily-white, up-tight, middle-class diversity values while living in SE Asia.</p>

<p>Indeed, kinky hair and behinds the size of loveseats are what should be considered a standard of &ldquo;beauty,&rdquo; right along with lips like inner tubes and brains like wet sand.</p>
<p>Enough is enough, it is reasonable to say that most black women look rather masculine and have abhorrent personalities. They are arrogant and rude, without cause; they are insecure because their &ldquo;men&rdquo; are little better than worthless gigolos; and of course, it is never their fault that even their &ldquo;men&rdquo; find them as repulsive as others do. It is always &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; not reality that makes them so &ldquo;precious,&rdquo; but yet unwanted. </p>

		<p>HAIR envy? Now I´ve seen everything.<br>
OK, I´m also guilty of finding nappy hair a serious turnoff (though not the most important in the demographics in question).<br>
- There is a reason this &#8220;epitome of femininity&#8221; evolved. Long, thick, lustry hair is a signal of health, i.e. the result of intraspecific evolution (= sexual selection). Locks are a telltale sign of domestication - there are no wild animals with locks. Nappy hair OTOH looks, well, not &#8220;unkempt&#8221; but &#8220;deformed&#8221; i.e. &#8220;sick&#8221;. I conclude, therefore, that the evolution of nappy hair must have had extraspecific (=environmental) reasons - though I am at a loss to come up with one. (Maybe - just maybe - a natural protection against getting banged on the head with hardwood objects. Customs like these are not uncommon in both Africa and the South Pacific.)</p>
<p>So, what´s a woman to do? You cannot very well legislate against it, and there is no one to sue. To paraphrase Yogi Berra, if people don´t want to come to the ballgame, you can´t stop them.</p>
<p>Get over it; take it like a man.</p>

		<p>I took my 5 year old daughter to see this and was glad I did. Every character in the movie is White.  Rapunzel was the epitome of White beauty with her hair, her blue eyes, her flawless facial features.</p>
<p>If you are tired of the relentless propaganda of Nickelodeon, but are literally wore out trying to find pro-White entertainment for your children, I would recommend buying this dvd for your daughters  Every time Dora the Explorer comes on, just pop this in the dvd player for them.  </p>

<p>You know, I say this every time blacks raise this issue. If you don&rsquo;t believe white folk are making the movies you want to see, start your own production company and make the movies you believe people want to see and you believe will make money. Goodness sake, these people are BEGGING white people to make money off them. If you don&rsquo;t like white folk ignoring you or exploiting you, make your own movies. Have these people ever heard the expression, &#8216;if you want something done right, do it yourself&rsquo;?</p>
<p>This is just another example of lazy black people wanting white people to do their work. And if by chance, the white made movie is a success, blacks complain that whites are profiting off them.</p>
<p>Damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>This is indeed a huge problem. African-American artists and animators should immediately form their own movie making studios and start producing movies featuring beautiful AA characters. There is no need to complain any further about Disney&rsquo;s racism. Just get started on creating your own movie studios. Problem solved.</p>

		<p>Wow, this &#8220;black woman&#8221; is just insane with jealousy over White women. White women are envied all over the world by every race - even by black men unfortunately - and she knows it, and it&rsquo;s eating her alive. What do you want to bet that she&rsquo;s lost some of her black men to White women? Their jealousy of us is one of the main reasons why we&rsquo;re attacked by them and our women - and men [ Chris Newson - Knoxville ] are raped by them, nobody rapes someone that repulses them.<br>
The bottom line is that these &#8220;Princess&#8221; movies are based on EUROPEAN fairy tales. As always, blacks want what&rsquo;s not theirs to have. They should make their own pricess movies. Why can&rsquo;t they just throw some rags on Latrinas head, have her dance around a fire and call it &#8220;Keepin it Reeeeaaal Wit Princess Latrina&#8221;. Of course a black version of Rapunzel would lose its appeal once Latrell yanked Latrina OUT of the window by her hair and then raped her at the bottom of the tower.  </p>

		<p>This woman is so demented and unhappy over being black that she should just do herself in.  No &#8220;girl of color&#8221; is required to see this movie.  NONE!  That she suggests showing a pretty blond girl on a movie screen is a slap in the face to blacks just shows how racists this awful, hateful woman is.</p>

		<p>I know this woman&rsquo;s blog, I read it so you don&rsquo;t have to. She&rsquo;s a fat, disabled black chick married to a white dude with two mixed-raced kids and she hates white people, talk about confused. Tangled is just your typical Disney fluff, at least it isn&rsquo;t some multi-culti junk like Avatar or that one with the Frog. If you have the stomach, check out the rest of her blog, it&rsquo;s the same junk. Black women are jealous because we are the best looking women, most black chicks are fat and ugly. This is just typical of how many of them think. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever read a report or article by a black that reported about something other than race.  They&rsquo;re consumed by it and the impression they give is that they can think of nothing else.</p>
<p>And, invariably, they all wind up whining about some perceived injustice just like this Michelle Obama who wrote her thesis complaining about being treated less than equal because she was black.  I wonder if it ever dawned on blacks like her that she was regarded as an AA gimme beneficiary by white students, because that&rsquo;s exactly what she was?</p>
<p>All the crybaby lamentations they bray about I&rsquo;m sure makes a lot of white people want to avoid them.</p>

		<p>Disney has been on a campaign to come clean and rehabilitate its image after the reign of Michael Eisner ended several years back. Hence, things like buying Pixar and coming out with nostalgic films like &#8220;Enchanted&#8221;. They realize that they can&rsquo;t alienate white people too much. The new Rapunzel is, I imagine, along these lines.</p>

<p>Rapunzel is a story of European origin why should the main character look black? Take some of your lovely old black fairy tales storybooks of African origin and publish them.  Oh I&rsquo;m sorry, I forgot that nowhere in sub-saharan Africa did any of the tribes take the time to invent a written language. </p>

		<p><i>&hellip;in a world in which natural Black kinky hair is seen as unkept and downright ugly, Rapunzel amounts to a slap in the face.</i></p>
<p>Whose standards are we talking about? Tastes vary, of course, but I and plenty of other white people see nothing &#8220;unkempt and ugly&#8221; about natural black hair; I saw some stylish black kids just the other day with medium afros and thought to myself &#8220;good look!&#8221;.<br>
 <br>
If black women think their hair is ugly it&rsquo;s not whitey&rsquo;s fault; we&rsquo;ve done nothing but encourage the whole &#8220;black is beautiful&#8221; thing since the &rsquo;60s. If anything, it&rsquo;s the &#8220;critical theorists&#8221; like this broad who, while their arguments might make them feel real smart in some sociology class and in some cases even contain a germ of an idea worth thinking about, are ultimately just screwing with the heads of the black masses, who, by the time these ideas filter down from the ivory towers of academia to MLK Boulevard, hear nothing but &#8220;black man good, white man bad&#8221;. </p>
<p>PS This reminds me of the classic Kurt Vonnegut short story &#8220;Harrison Bergeron, which starts out:</p>
<p><i>THE YEAR WAS 2081, and everybody was finally equal. They weren&rsquo;t only equal before God and the law. They were equal every which way. Nobody was smarter than anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody was stronger or quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the 211th, 212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing vigilance of agents of the United States Handicapper General.</i></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a link to the story, well worth a look:</p>

<p>I think this is something a lot white people do not grasp. Colored people to include Asians and all the various mixes will not be satisfied until all whites have been wiped off the face of the earth. Every resource we expend to enhance the life of colored people is a gift to humans who have an insatiable desire to see us obliterated. And they do not want us to go away easily. Same as it ever was.

Reading between the lines, I&rsquo;m assuming the author is a heavyset black woman with uncontrollable kinky, nappy hair and that she lost her boyfriend (or has seen too many black men with) to a thin, white women with glowing, shinning, lusciously flowing blond hair.</p>
<p>Kinky, nappy, black hair has never been seen as a mark of beauty despite all the efforts of blacks to empower blacks to love and embrace their hair.</p>
<p>This is yet another reason for separation. In a black nation with black women with kinky, nappy hair, this author might be seen as the epitome of beauty. In a white nation, she will never be seen as beautiful even by black men.<br>

Now you know how we Whites feel when we see will smith, denzel washington, the rock, et al starring in remakes of traditionally white films such as the &#8220;I am Legend&#8221; story and &#8220;The Manchurian Candidate&#8221; and &#8220;Walking Tall&#8221; and &#8220;The Karate Kid&#8221;, etc. When will we see the end of the black remake?

I won&rsquo;t even waste my time on watching them.

		<p>This is just more demonstrable evidence of what we&rsquo;ve all come to understand: Blacks are incentivized to cry foul, because they get things out of it. It&rsquo;s that simple, and whether their accusations accurately correspond to reality is utterly irrelevant.</p>
<p>One notices immediately that she cries foul, yet proposes no superior alternatives. She complains that a blonde Disney character succeeds the black one, yet proposes no superior alternative: Should every Disney character be black? Should white Disney characters be a thing of the past?</p>
<p>One should also note (and this has been pointed out) that there aren&rsquo;t any &#8220;acceptable&#8221; ways for whites to respond. Given a black character, the character (according to some arbitrary standard by some arbitrary physical features) isn&rsquo;t black enough. If whites display happy blacks, they&rsquo;re &#8220;ignoring the problems of African American communities.&#8221; If whites show problems associated with African American communities, we&rsquo;re &#8220;sadistically enjoying the suffering of others&#8221; (as was the allegation after the movie &#8220;Precious&#8221; came out).</p>
<p>At its core, this is a slow movement to find something wrong with everything white or Western, that white and Western institutions are to be done away with automatically.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, Disney is a private company. If this woman wants black movies from Disney, she&rsquo;s free to purchase stocks in the company so her voice is heard. If she wants &#8220;black children&rsquo;s movies&#8221; of any kind, she&rsquo;s free to start her own film company. But the thought that a private company (that became famous by retelling versions of European traditional fairy tales, no less) should be subject to her personal preferences is narcissistic, selfish and repulsive.</p>

The evil, stupid hyenas were a darker color than the good-guy lions and were voiced by a black (Whoopi Goldberg) and a Hispanic (Cheech Marin)!  The most villainous lion in the movie had gay mannerisms!  The movie was sexist because the lionesses had to do all the hunting!  And on and on.  Never mind the fact that hyenas really ARE darker than lions, never mind the fact that nobody held a gun to Goldberg&rsquo;s or Marin&rsquo;s heads to make them take the job, never mind the fact that blacks like James Earl Jones voiced good-guy characters, never mind the fact that the most evil character in the movie was voiced by a white English male, never mind that bisexual Elton John wrote the songs for the movie, and never mind the fact that lionesses really do the hunting in the animal kingdom.  Disney was still evil, racist, sexist, and homophobic!!!  </p>

Granted, it isn&rsquo;t black or nappy, but I was at war with it my entire life, until I started noticing the black children with heads full of stiff ponytails pointing out in all directions with huge beads wound in them.

<p>We could turn it on its head like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Every day young white girls open magazines, turn on televisions or see images depicting black women rappers, sports stars, divas and glamor ghetto chic.  They rarely see images of calm, educated, well-mannered and clean white womanhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>So what?  White people need to keep hidden for black self-esteem now?</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t go and see the movie!!!  I don&rsquo;t think the actress in &#8220;Precious&#8221; was a good role model for the females in my life, so I didn&rsquo;t take them to see that movie.</p>

		<p>Would definitely be too controversial for Disney, or even today&rsquo;s Hollywood, but could be a significant film, where a black women character has her wish granted and is magically transformed into a white blonde beauty.</p>
<p>Then it could perhaps be pointed out that we are already in the skin best suited us and/or maybe that beauty is something much easier for others to appreciate than for the princess from within.</p>

		<p>I wonder whether our preference for white beauty is something that we are culturally programmed for or if it&rsquo;s something deeper. Everyone agrees that a sunset is beautiful. It transcends culture and seems to speak to something very basic in human nature, some primordial aesthetic. I suspect that the preference for soft, flowing hair is probably likewise almost universal. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine anyone actually wanting to have nappy hair, even in a racially neutral or afrocentric society. But of course that&rsquo;s the kind of thing our cultural relativists would never admit to.</p>
