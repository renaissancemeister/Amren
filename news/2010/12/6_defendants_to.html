			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Demian Bulwa, San Francisco Chronicle, December 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A judge sent six men to trial Tuesday in connection with the alleged gang rape of a 16-year-old girl outside a Richmond High School homecoming dance after a prosecutor said the victim had been punched, kicked, sexually assaulted and urinated on &#8220;like she wasn&rsquo;t even human.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Judge Gregory Caskey released the youngest of the seven defendants in the case, 16-year-old Cody Smith of San Pablo. </p>
<p>Caskey said the lead investigator in the case had interrogated Smith in violation of his Miranda rights two days after the incident, {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The other five defendants still face up to life in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>The judge made his decision after four weeks of preliminary hearing testimony in Contra Costa County Superior Court in Martinez that was often graphic and disturbing. </p>
<p>At issue was whether the girl  &mdash;  a Richmond High student whose blood-alcohol level was found to be more than four times the state&rsquo;s legal driving limit  &mdash;  was forcibly raped or simply set upon by opportunistic men, and whether the key witnesses, most of whom allegedly took part in the attack, could be trusted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>New argument</b></p>
<p>Complicating matters was a new argument made Tuesday by the attorney for defendant John Crane Jr., 44, of Richmond, whom police connected to the alleged rape only through a cold hit in a DNA database. Because no witnesses put Crane at the scene, attorney Dustin Gordon contended, it was clear that Crane and the girl had sex hours earlier.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Dueling arguments</b></p>
<p>During closing arguments, Morales&rsquo; attorney, Ernest Castillo, echoed the views of other defense lawyers when he said the victim willingly &#8220;drank herself into a state of unconsciousness.&#8221; Castillo said the girl was beaten but was not forcibly raped, because the blows were &#8220;not used to overcome her will.&#8221; Instead, he said, the violence was gratuitous.</p>
<p>Cashman [Senior deputy district attorney Dara Cashman] sharply disagreed, saying the defendants had held the girl and beaten her.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the time someone screamed, &#8216;Let&rsquo;s do a train,&rsquo; everyone there lost their humanity,&#8221; Cashman said.</p>

		<p>What kind of a justice system releases a rapist because the arresting officer was lax?  First of all, I think Miranda belongs in the trash along with the legislators who brought it into our legal process.</p>
<p>What kind of &#8220;just&#8221; system does not demand that evidence of the guilt of a defendant be disclosed no matter which side discovers it?  Well, ours doesn&rsquo;t.  And if you think that&rsquo;s fair, you&rsquo;re part of the problem.</p>
<p>The American justice system is not about guilt, innocence, and punishment.  It is a charade and the gullible cattle never seem to question it until they are a victim of it.</p>
<p>This country disgusts me more and more each day!  I bet the cop who was delinquent in his position is still on the payroll.  And, why shouldn&rsquo;t the victim be allowed to sue this incompetent police officer for damages?<br>

		<p>So Hispanics have driven the blacks out of Richmond.  It used to be a nearly all black town.  Christopher Darden grew up there.  He was the black prosecutor who had O.J. Simpson try on the murder gloves.</p>

		<p>The one and only white defendant had all charges dropped against him.  Not because he was white.  Because he had enough sense not to violate the victim. </p>

		<p>Zipskinny.com lists Richmond, CA&rsquo;s demographics as:</p>
<p>Hispanic/Latino: 	22.6%<br>
White: 	18.2%<br>
Black: 	44.1%</p>
<p>This is another East Bay city I accelerate past on the freeway, making sure the gas tank is full, the car in good working order, the doors locked, windows up, cell phone fully charged and at hand, 911 programmed on speed dial.</p>
<p>From the <i>Comical</i> article:</p>
<p><i>At issue was whether the girl&hellip;was forcibly raped or simply set upon by opportunistic men</i></p>
<p>For God&rsquo;s Sake, what in the hell is the difference?  This precious young girl was brutalized and dehumanized in a race-based attack:</p>
<p><i>the non-White attackers punched and kicked the young girl until she stopped resisting. Then, for two-and-a-half hours, they took turns raping her, inviting their friends to join in. By the end of the attack, at least five men (possibly 10) had raped her before leaving her lying unconscious in a gravel parking lot across the street from her school, naked from the waist up.</i></p>
<p><i>The young men laughed and shot photos as they took turns assaulting the girl, police said.</i></p>
<p>And a cretinous lawyer has the nerve to defend these non-human beasts:</p>
<p>Morales&rsquo; attorney, Ernest Castillo&hellip; said the victim willingly &#8216;drank herself into a state of unconsciousness.&rsquo;  The girl was beaten but was not forcibly raped, because the blows were &#8216;not used to overcome her will.&rsquo; Instead, he said, the violence was gratuitous.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>And this story is barely a blip in the Southern part of the state where I reside, meriting only two lean paragraphs in the local paper, on a back page on the bottom of the page, no mention of the brutality of the crime nor the race or age of the victim.</p>
<p>Do you think there were any women&rsquo;s groups that came to court to offer support?</p>
<p>Will her ordeal be made into a Lifetime movie?</p>
<p>Will there be any marches and calls for justice, covered 24/7 by CNN? Demands that the principal and superintendent be fired?</p>
<p><i>She said none of the four officers who were at the homecoming dance were patrolling the school premises even though there were a dozen young men hanging out just a few feet from the gym entrance.</i> </p>
<p><i>&#8216;I looked outside of the gym and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs,&rsquo; but the security officers who are employed here did no checking. The assistant principal looked outside and actually saw those men, and did nothing about it.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>According to the media, White lives are expendable, no matter their age or the brutality of the attack.  For non-Whites this is Social Justice.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t come up with a better example.  And these attacks will increase.</p>

		<p>What is the difference between being raped and being &#8216;set upon by opportunistic men&rsquo;?</p>
<p>That being said, why was a 16 year old girl drinking, and to the point of being 4 times the legal limit? Perhaps if she&rsquo;d been sober, the incident wouldn&rsquo;t have taken place. Granted, the males are slime, but females can be slime, too, and have a responsibility in their own welfare.</p>

		<p>This case makes my blood boil.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it implied in many different places that the victim was white, but I&rsquo;ve never seen it confirmed by any newspaper, TV station, or other news source.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any proof that the victim was white?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume she was. How are we to be sure that there wasn&rsquo;t a racial component to this vicious, hateful crime? If they&rsquo;re keeping her race under wraps, how do we know they aren&rsquo;t keeping quiet race-related comments the attackers might have said? Or worst of all, how do we know that the prosecutors are asking the right questions in order to find out if there was racial motivation involved in this?</p>
<p>If the victim was in fact white, I find it very difficult to believe that the pack of feral Hispanics that raped her weren&rsquo;t aware of her being white and that the fact that she was white didn&rsquo;t factor into how horribly they treated her.</p>
<p>Last but not least, what exactly does it take for a horrible hate crime against a white kid to get reported in the national media?</p>
