<h1><a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/12/29/dem-warns-bill-clinton-back-off/#more-141181">Dem Warns Bill Clinton: Back Off</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, December 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rep. Danny Davis, a Democrat from Illinois and mayoral candidate in Chicago has a message for former President Bill Clinton: Butt out.</p>
<p>Davis, a onetime ally of Clinton&rsquo;s, issued a strongly worded statement Tuesday, in which the Chicago Democrat said he is &#8220;seriously concerned and disturbed&#8221; by the news Clinton plans to throw his weight behind ex-Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and make a campaign stop in the Windy City next month.</p>
<p>&#8220;The African American community has enjoyed a long and fruitful relationship with the Clintons, however it appears as though some of that relationship maybe fractured and perhaps even broken should former President Clinton come to town and participate overtly in efforts to thwart the legitimate political aspirations of Chicago&rsquo;s Black community,&#8221; Davis said in the statement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a recent poll, Emanuel is garnering close to 44 percent of support from likely Chicago voters while Davis is far back at 7 percent.</p>
<p>UPDATE: The Chicago Sun Times&rsquo; Lynn Sweet reports that Carol Mosely Braun, a former ambassador to New Zealand under Clinton and now a candidate for mayor in Chicago, is also calling on the former president to back off.</p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;The African American community has enjoyed a long and fruitful relationship with the Clintons&hellip;</i></p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s true.  President Hillary Rodham Clinton can confirm it.</p>
<p>Really, Bill Clinton really doesn&rsquo;t matter either way.  The only real obstacle in Rahm&rsquo;s way was the residency lawsuit.  Now that that hurdle is passed, all he has to do is hold his finger on his nose and walk a straight line, and he&rsquo;s Mayor.</p>
<p>The whole irony of this is that the country as a whole can elect a black President in 2008, but the city where that black President is from can&rsquo;t seem to be able to elect a black mayor in 2011, in spite of it having the highest number of black residents of any city in the country.</p>

		<p>Bill Clinton has been referred to as &#8220;America&rsquo;s first Black President,&#8221; because of his strong pro-Black agenda.  How was his deep and proven friendship to Blacks repaid?  When his wife ran for President, Blacks abandoned her like a stampede for someone with darker skin color.</p>
<p>Now &#8220;America&rsquo;s First Black President&#8221; is being told that he is unwelcome in Chicago.  Let this be a lesson to all politicians: Blacks and Hispanics will use you as long as it it is to their interest.  Blood (genes) is thicker than water (political ideals).  </p>

		<p>Thought I&rsquo;d check; Carol Mosely Braun is a black. Clinton sends her to New Zealand as Ambassador.  He also sent a black to replace a Slovenian-American ambassador for the post in Slovenia.  Slovenia elected its first black mayor (a naturalized African) in its history this year.  Any connection?</p>
<p>It proves that Democrats are obsessed with white national and cultural destruction.</p>

Any white person who considers blacks their friend and ally is ignorant of how blacks think and act.</p>
<p>As long as you cater to blacks, they&rsquo;ll tell you you&rsquo;re their best friend. Show any independent thinking or deviate from their agenda, and they will turn on you in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>President Clinton likely believes that blacks truly love him with all their heart and soul. They don&rsquo;t. They used him when it was convenient and now he&rsquo;s of no use to them.</p>
<p>I would love to believe that President Clinton would see the light and learn from this but that&rsquo;s a one in a billion prospect. It&rsquo;s more likely President Clinton will redouble his efforts to appeal to blacks and grovel for their love.</p>
<p>He might even try to reason with them as to why he made the choice he did (&#8216;It&rsquo;s for your own best, long-term benefit&rsquo;). They won&rsquo;t care. He&rsquo;s dead to them.</p>

		<p>If you don&rsquo;t back black, you are a racist.  Nice to see that the racial identity politics that Bill and the rest of the white Dems helped to create swinging back at them now.  That&rsquo;s what makes me laugh when liberal white democrats and their MSM mouthpieces talk about the impending collapse of the (marginally better) Republican party.  Whatever they think is going to happen to the Repubs is going to happen to the Democrats first.  </p>

		<p>What is forgotten is that, in real life experience, blacks are much more racially-conscious (and racist) than whites.  A white person is much more capable of looking at the individual; blacks see - when all is accounted for - only the race of the individual.  As many posters to AmRen state on an almost daily basis: we are the only race that doesn&rsquo;t see race first, and act accordingly.</p>

		<p>Eric, I&rsquo;m not a big fan of the Republican Party but the Democrats are always hounding them about being more inclusive of minorities when in fact the Republicans should be doing everything they can to repel them and not provide a safety valve for White liberals.  White liberals are on the verge of becoming a minority within the Democrat Party.  If the Republicans would stay focused on getting the White vote and not offer any sort of reaching out to gays and feminists they&rsquo;ll soon be submerged in a black, brown and yellow sea where the progressive agenda is marginalized and takes a back seat to ethnocentrism.  </p>

<p>Actually, this is not quite true. Before January 2008, Blacks supported Clinton over Obama by 2-1. It was only after Obama won the Iowa caucus did Blacks began to support him. In fact, may older Blacks over 50 still supported Clinton even When the annointed one was competitive with her.</p>

		<p>Many black pols stabbed the Clintons in the back when Bill was accused of racism during the last Dem presidential primary.  The Chicago race provides a way for him to get back at them, albeit in a small way.  <br>
If there weren&rsquo;t so many blacks running in this race, black voters would be able to easily coalese behind one of them and provide true opposition to Rahm.  </p>

<p>Point taken.  But I think a lot of New York City blacks are Afro-Caribbeans or mulatto-Caribbeans, and I would still be willing to think that Chicago has a higher number of domestic blacks (&#8220;African-Americans&#8221;) than NYC.</p>

		<p>It would be helpful if Danny Davis, and anyother black pols for that matter, would write out a list of what whites should do and when, so we don&rsquo;t have any of these faux pas in the future.  My guess it would look something like this:</p>
<p>1.  Black first<br>
2.  Brown Second <br>
3.  Immigrant thrid<br>
4   Women next<br>
5.  Whites last</p>

All true. But another point to be made is that Clinton also used THEM   &mdash;    just so long as as it was to HIS interest.  In fact, Slick Willy was/is a master opportunist who far outclasses any of them in deviousness and disloyalty. After selling out his own people all his life, betraying his own and pandering to others wherever it was convenient, he has no right to expect any loyalty from anyone in return.  In fact, it&rsquo;s kind of gratifying to see him get a small taste of his own medicine.<br>

		<p> Its a very sad thing watching the decline of the United States but at least some amusing events are unfolding.It does not matter if a politician like Clinton has kissed up to black voters in the past they will not let him get between a brother or sister who is running for public office. Clinton can hate his fellow white people,agree to give &#8220;African Americans&#8221; handouts and practically wear black face, not to insult but look like a brother,they will not let him form a wedge between a brotha.<br>
 I can&rsquo;t wait to see the day when Hispanics and Asians in substantial numbers begin running for public office in large U.S. cities and black people tell them to back off.The future might be dangerous and hilarious at the same time.</p>

		<p>I agree with all the posters about blacks being more racially conscious (at least more open about it) than most whites.  I also think it&rsquo;s a good idea to not accept these white liberals, especially ones who&rsquo;ve made accusing whites of being racists as part of their career.  They abandoned us, so let&rsquo;s return the favor to them.</p>
