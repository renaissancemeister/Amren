<h1>DREAM Act Failure &#8216;Biggest Disappointment&rsquo; of the Year</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News Latino, Dec. 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a press conference on Wednesday that touted the accomplishments of the so-called Lame Duck session of Congress, President Barack Obama spoke about the importance of immigration reform and reiterated that the failure to pass the DREAM Act may be his &#8220;biggest disappointment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama said that these children grow up like other kids in America, only to find themselves under a &#8220;shadow of fear&#8221; through no fault of their own. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Migration Policy Institute says that the measure would have immediately favored more than 700,000 young people, while the Department of Education estimates that more than 50,000 college-eligible undocumented immigrants graduate from U.S. high schools every year.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama and members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus agreed Tuesday that immigration reform is still an important priority for the next legislature, the White House said.</p>
<p>The lawmakers present at the Tuesday meeting were Sen. Bob Menéndez of New Jersey and Reps. Xavier Becerra of California, Nydia Velázquez of New York, Charlie González of Texas and Luís Gutiérrez of Illinois. All are Democrats. </p>

		<p>The illegals often lie about their age. And since it allows those up to 30 yrs old to get citizenship, that means practically every illegal under 40 will make a try for it. outrageous</p>

I saw the press conference. The first question came from an Hispanic reporter. The President and the reported greeted each other in Spanish.</p>

		<p>If these poor children of illegals want to get out from under the &#8220;shadow&#8221; they live under, they should hie themselves to the closest ICE agent and report themselves and their parents for deportation.  AFTER paying back the citizens of their State and community for the social services they ripped off illegally.  Then they would not have to live with guilt, and in the shadows.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out what &#8220;fear&#8221; it is that these law breakers live under. They go everywhere freely, some even go on TV declaring themselves illegal. For those with the tiniest hesitation to get themselves to the welfare department, let me assure you that nothing will be done to you. You will be cheerfully greeted, handing a bag full of food stamps, a map with the direction to the nearest place to sign up for reduced rent, a list of available jobs that Americans &#8220;won&rsquo;t do,&#8221; schools for your children, the closest hospital where you&rsquo;ll be treated at taxpayer expense for your anchor babies, and upon leaving, you&rsquo;ll be told to &#8220;come back if there is anything else Uncle Sam can do for you.&#8221; So, sleep well, you have nothing to fear in el norte.</p>

		<p>For once, I believe this President. He understood that the DREAM Act is the Trojan Horse for further immigration relaxation and dilution of the Anglo-American culture for which he has contempt.  The misguided media, let by superficial pundits posing as journalists like NBC&rsquo;s Andrea Mitchell and David Gregory, couldn&rsquo;t contain themselves after the tax cut extension.  They blurted how smart Obama is and how he has bounded back from the slaps the voters levied on his wasting regime.  But the key vote was DREAM.  The Senate, not bound by majority vote, contained enough frightened Dems from border and southern states to prevent the 60 necessary votes. </p>
<p>But remember, a majority of the Senate voted to make citizenship a joke.  The future Senate still will be organized by Reid and Schumer, but the added Republicans in that body should be able to block passage of DREAM. </p>
<p>Obama on the other hand will veto any meaningful closing of current immigration loopholes, including anchor socalled citizens, H-1 visas even though real Americans can&rsquo;t get jobs, or measures that would really crack down on employers, porous borders or irresponsible schools and colleges that encourage illegal immigrant scholarships and enrollment.</p>

		<p>America imported 490,000 Indians with fake degrees on the H-1B visa in 2008 and 2009, sending millions of american engineers to the unemployment lines</p>
<p>STOP THIS EVIL H-1B VISA</p>

		<p>And you still don&rsquo;t see the point.  The corporate rulers of this country are well ahead of the curve.  Because they set the limits of it&rsquo;s national-stresspoint boundaries to begin with.</p>
<p>We fret and stew over illegal immigration as a threat to our pathetic existence in their eyes.</p>
<p>While they include Tax Law breaks that we will never -hear- about because hey, no Congressman can be expected to actually, you know, /read/ a 1,920 page report.  Let alone be always present to listen to open floor debates or vote directly instead of by proxi.</p>
<p>Corporate rule is about rule of the wealthy over a herd whose consumption feeds their lifestyles of doing nothing useful for our society.</p>
<p>They -import- a prole population to dilute the brains and keep that untermenche in it&rsquo;s place: cowed, placid and stupid.</p>
<p>Whether DREAM comes around again or not, the smart stuff, the _dangerous_ stuff, the stuff we are now, as taxpayers, on the hook for, was in the tax bill.</p>

		<p>Here in California it&rsquo;s a little too late. Hispanics are now the majority and after a couple of generations of reproducing (w/o immigration)they will be in charge politically, socially and will really be calling the shots. </p>
<p>As for H1B visas, that above statement is fully correct. Most engineers had to find work elsewhere after the large import of Indian labor. Don&rsquo;t see that stopping anytime soon. </p>
<p>Oh, don&rsquo;t count on the Repubicans doing anything significant these next two years, they&rsquo;re chicken and really want to work with the other party. Best to accept that this is all happening, and try to tailor your lives &#8220;around&#8221; this big sociatal change that is coming. Sad to see such a great country fade away like it is. </p>
