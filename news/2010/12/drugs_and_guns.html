<h1>Drugs and Guns Are Killing New York  &mdash;  Two Thirds of Murder Victims Are Black, Drugs Involved</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edgar Sandoval, Rocco Parascandola, and Larry Mcshane, New York Daily News, December 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s late Saturday night, sometime after 3 a.m.</p>
<p>A black man with a history of drug crimes, somewhere between 25 and 40 years old, is hanging on the streets with a gun-toting pal.</p>
<p>That man is the New Yorker most likely to be murdered in 2010.</p>
<p>A Daily News review of the latest NYPD crime statistics shows drugs are a factor in at least half of city homicides  &mdash;  and two out of three victims are black.</p>
<p>Stats through Tuesday reveal 49% of all murder victims are involved with drug use and/or drug sales. The figure is 53% for murder suspects.</p>
<p>The numbers say 67% of murder victims are black, with 25% Hispanic and just 4% white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Much of the data mirrors past years, when black men were most often targeted in fatal shootings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The stats also showed 65% of killings occur outdoors; only 10% of murder suspects were women, and 77% of victims knew their killers.</p>
<p>The last figure underscores what police have maintained for years: There&rsquo;s little chance of a law-abiding New Yorker dying at the hands of a stranger.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said the department was still focused on derailing the deadly drug trade.</p>

<p>And what are the racial percentages for the <i>perpetrators</i>?  You&rsquo;d think that out of the trio of Edgar Sandoval, Rocco Parascandola, and Larry Mcshane, at least <i>one</i> of them might have been at least a little bit curious.</p>
<p>But I guess those aren&rsquo;t numbers that New Yorkers need to know, right?</p>

		<p>I live in New York&rsquo;s capital region, and even here the vast majority of murderers and victims are Blacks. On the evening news two rapes of 21 year old students (race unmentioned)were just reported. Both attackers were strangers and no race mentioned (so they are 95% likely to be Blacks or one Black). There is currently a trial in progress involving the prosecution of a Black murderer that killed a White college student during an armed robbery. </p>
<p>Just to think that these cities around here were Dutch and English and managed to absorb Irish and Italian immigrants in large numbers. Times have changed for the worse and now we have masses of unassimalated barbarians living amongst us.</p>

		<p>And the headlines will say that &#8220;New Yorkers&#8221; have a high rate of drug and gun crime. &#8220;New Yorkers&#8221;!</p>
<p>ONLY a certain specific group of &#8220;New Yorkers&#8221; have a high rate of gun and drug crime. NOT all &#8220;New Yorkers&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, since the time of Guiliani, NYC has done a very good job of policing. The murder rate prior to G was about 2,500 persons per year. Since G is around 600 per year and holding firm. Something very dramatic did occur. And shows what can be done if the WILL is present.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d be a lot more interested in hearing if these murders are contained in a given geographic area besides &#8216;East Side&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And if new ethnies are entering into those areas, causing compression.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to know how many of these supposed sales are to other poor ethnies and at what time of the month.</p>
<p>Welfare and Crack habits are a bad combination.  Whites empowering blacks to kill each other as suppliers for their own habit is a bad thing.  Find the money and the supply problem goes away.  Kill the supply and the dealer lives long enough to starve to death or go to jail for some unrelated reason.</p>
<p>If push comes to shove, try regional curfews.  Give the residents the facts and let them choose whether they want Mr. Saleem Sterling out there at 3am for no good reason but to act as a bullet magnet.  Or a trigger finger.</p>
<p>And as far as that goes, Mr. Sharpton, if you think all it takes is a stupid T-Shirt, you&rsquo;re rich and shameless, go print some up.</p>

		<p>This is no mystery; the narco-gangsta lifestyle is dangerous.  By selling drugs, these people are dealing with unpredictable, irrational, drugged-up weirdos who - due to the inability of the dealers to call police after being robbed of their drugs or cash - are tempted to attempt armed robbery.</p>
<p>The Usual Suspects will say this represents a tragedy, but what about young blacks who stay in school and learn a skilled trade?  Nobody kills them on the streets at 3:00 AM because they&rsquo;re at home sleeping since they have to go to work during the days, and while being murdered is pretty much a job-related risk for a drug dealer, nobody kills carpet installers, plumbers or janitors in these numbers.  There&rsquo;s a simple way to win this game: don&rsquo;t play.</p>

		<p>As a resident of this city, I can tell you there are whole SWATHS of it that are now no-go areas for whites.  I mean that literally.  Just being there is like being a white lamb walking through the territory of starving panthers.</p>
<p>I have had some real scares in this regard, and they literally look you up and down - and you see them reaching for their hidden gun, all the while boring their eyes into you.</p>
<p>Latinos I know all say the same thing: most blacks are violent and they don&rsquo;t want to live around them.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t blame it only on poverty, because there are plenty of poor whites who don&rsquo;t do those things.  It is a cultural pattern of violence.  </p>
<p>Even white liberals don&rsquo;t dare venture into those places unless it is in broad daylight, and even then they go into the schools and clinics in a hurry, do their good deeds, and scurry home before nightfall.</p>

		<p>I think this is a psychological head trick to try to keep white people from worrying about black or Hispanic crime.  The bromide is that &#8220;most&#8221; murder victims are the same kind of habitual ne&rsquo;er-do-wells as the people that murdered them, ergo &#8220;good white&#8221; people have nothing to worry about.  Except if you factor out the murders that are supposedly &#8220;no big deal&#8221; because they&rsquo;re by &#8220;bad people&#8221; against &#8220;bad people,&#8221; then you still have a murder rate way higher than in lily-white areas, and someone has to be the victims of those.  The St. Louis Police Chief tried this almost ten years ago, by saying that 3/4 of all STL City murders involved both victim and perp with similar criminal histories (read:  black thug on black thug).  The obvious deduction he wanted us to make is that &#8220;good whites&#8221; could never be murder victims in the City.  But since 75% of city murders were supposedly not the problem of good white people, this means that 25% of them were.  And 25% of what was the city&rsquo;s murder rate at the time was still 2.75 higher than the murder rate in adjoining St. Louis County, and way higher than any of the suburban collar counties in Missouri.</p>
<p>Of course, articles like these only tell you the racial composition of the victims, but not of the perps.  In this the season where many of us here on AR are about to celebrate the observed anniversary of the birth of a child we take as divine and immaculately conceived as an article of faith, I suppose these murders without any actual perps were also immaculately committed.  That, or we let reason carry the day with the latter question, and conclude the obvious racial taboo.</p>

		<p>The writer seems to think that it&rsquo;s somehow unfair that, &#8220;There&rsquo;s little chance of a law-abiding New Yorker dying at the hands of a stranger.&#8221; If white people committed more crimes they would be more proportionately represented among murder victims, and perhaps murderers. </p>
<p>It is clearly only entrenched racism that prevents whites from being murdered in satisfactory numbers. Whites must mix more freely with black criminals if they are ever going to redeem themselves from the wickedness of racism. </p>

		<p>Note all the emphasis on who the victims are, not who the perpetrators are.  I&rsquo;m sure that more than two thirds of the murderers are black.  Also, the guns aren&rsquo;t standing on their hind legs and killing people.  It&rsquo;s people (mostly black) killing other people, not guns killing people.  Indeed NYC makes it almost impossible for law abiding people to own guns so the criminals know their victims are highly unlikely to be able to shoot back.</p>

		<p>If you are a law abiding white person you are not likely to be murdered by a black criminal. If you live in or near a black neighborhood you face heightened vulnerability to being mugged, robbed at gun point, or raped by black criminals. Your home is vulnerable to burglary. If there are very few blacks near where you live you are much safer, even if you live with poor whites.     <br>

I used to think white flight was caused by irrational color prejudice. That was several violent black felonies ago. Racial stereotypes are over generalizations of what is really true.  </p>

<p>I think New York has figured this out. Criminals don&rsquo;t care about gun laws so they Always have them. But by not allowing honest, decent, law abiding citizens to carry concealed weapons they have put the criminal mid at ease, since they are the only ones who have a gun.

<p>I found that bit about Al Sharpton in the original article.  He states that it makes him sad that young blacks are wearing Scarface T-Shirts instead of Malcolm X T-Shirts.  Of course, since this article is about black on black crime, a Malcolm X T-shirt would be just as bad, because other blacks assassinated him, those blacks being the rivals he made when he was in thick with the Nation of Islam in the 1950s and early 1960s.  And in 1997, lest we forget, Malcolm X III (grandson) killed Mrs. Malcolm X (Betty Shabazz) by setting fire to her home while she was sleeping.</p>

Blacks tell me that whites in the lilly-white suburbs use more drugs than blacks.</p>
<p>The NRA is mostly white, &#8216;good-ol-boys&rsquo; so whites own most of the guns.</p>
<p>Since whites are the alleged biggest users of illegal drugs and they have the most guns, why aren&rsquo;t white suburban communities killing fields?</p>

Actually, I would say that (certain) types of poor whites are the best people to live around, since they are not nearly so crime prone as blacks, and not nearly so likely to engage in liberal preening as wealthy whites. My experiences with &#8220;country&#8221; folk especially, have compared favorably to my experiences with blacks and, to a lesser extent, northern whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks tell me that whites in the lilly-white suburbs use more drugs than blacks.&#8221;<br>
They never specify what type of drugs. In general, whites, if they use illegal drugs, take stuff like pot, which is unlikely to end up causing you to murder someone. By contrast, black drug use runs the gamut of illegal drugs, and some of the more creative ways of getting high (like Jankum) appear to be black inventions.<br>
And we do own most of the guns. But we keep them for self-defense, not to kill somebody for drug money or because they screwed us in a drug deal.</p>

<p>I would agree. They find a time or a place or a week or even a crime where &#8216;poor minorities&rsquo; are more likely to be a victim and make a news story out of this. Might it really be about separating &#8216;privileged&rsquo; white boys from their potential girlfriends (of course and then increasing crime)? Interesting that this is NYC. A couple of decades ago, National Lampoon Magazine had an article about a &#8216;minnesota to NY pipeline&rsquo;. White, blonde haired women were being piped in to NYC from the midwest. They were being used up faster than they could be piped in. </p>

<p>Great post, paisan! While we&rsquo;re at it, many drivers in NASCAR like to go hunting during the off-season. Why is it, we never hear of Jeff Burton or Ward Burton being arrested for shooting or threatening someone with a gun, like we do with NBA and NFL players?</p>
<p>&#8216;Quemadmoeum gladis nemeinum occidit, occidentis telum est&#8221; (&#8220;A sword is never a killer, it&rsquo;s a tool in the killer&rsquo;s hands&#8221;) <br>
                       <br>
                                                                            &mdash;   M.A. Seneca</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick and tired of people blaming guns for causing deaths; as if guns just jumped up off the table, or out of a drawer and arbitrarily shot someone.</p>
<p>White suburban communities aren&rsquo;t killing fields because they exercise greater personal responsibility than any other class of people. Bantus don&rsquo;t.<br>

		<p>In Philadelphia, it is interesting to note that on the nightly news the race of the instigator of violence or crime is not mentioned, BUT when they show the face of the alleged suspect it is 99% of the time a black male. </p>
