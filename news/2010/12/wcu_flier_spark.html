<h1>WCU Flier Sparks Controversy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Miller, Daily Local, December 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Controversial fliers announcing the formation of a White Student Union on West Chester University&rsquo;s campus were allegedly part of an effort to connect those are who against racism and are not the seeds of a racist organization, according to school officials.</p>
<p>The flier states:</p>
<p>Feeling under represented on campus?<br>
Looking for a place to share YOUR views?<br>
Uncomfortable in other &#8220;special interest&#8221; groups?<br>
Then this is the place for you!</p>
<p>The flier invites interested students to the club&rsquo;s first meeting. It also includes a photo of seven fists in the air.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There is absolutely no White Student Union here,&#8221; Sheridan [Pam Sheridan, university spokeswoman] said. &#8220;There absolutely isn&rsquo;t going to be a meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing the fliers, students and others raised concerns over the possibility of a racist organization on campus, Sheridan said. The Campus Client Intervention Team, which addresses acts of intolerance or bigotry, conducted an investigation. The examination revealed that the fliers were actually posted to promote anti-racism, Sheridan said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;People who know the students who distributed the fliers know what they represent and they don&rsquo;t represent (racism),&#8221; Sheridan said. &#8220;The poster was put together with a totally different agenda in mind and it backfired. The intent was in fact positive  &mdash;  to get people to talk about an issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is unclear how the flier authors would have handled the situation if protesters and/or students interested in the club showed up for the meeting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>West Chester University has roughly 14,000 students. About 15 percent of WCU students are minorities.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Campus Client Intervention Team sent out a campuswide e-mail explaining that the White Student Union was fictional.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Campus Climate Intervention Team remains committed to a safe, inclusive, diverse and civil environment and counts on every member to make that a reality,&#8221; the e-mail stated. &#8220;We regret deeply the discomfort that this has caused segments of our campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Briana Rollerson, a freshman and member of the Black Student Union, felt the flier was done in poor taste.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my opinion, it seems like it&rsquo;s mocking the Black Student Union,&#8221; Rollerson said.</p>
<p>Rollerson said BSU does not focus only on race, but holds events related to religion and sex, and recently celebrated Hispanic Heritage Month. She also said anyone is welcome to join BSU or attend its events.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Quinn Larson, of Downingtown, said the university should be open to allowing a group that focuses on white students&rsquo; needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&rsquo;s open to everyone, then I don&rsquo;t think it would be a problem,&#8221; Larson said.</p>
<p>Another student, who asked to remain anonymous, said the university should avoid clubs that are classified by skin color. At the same time, the student said because there is a Black Student Union it would be OK to offer a &#8220;European Student Union&#8221; that focuses on European cultural aspects, like food and art.</p>

		<p>Welcome to the wacky word of white activism. Where even the racists are really anti-racists. Are there any real racists?</p>
<p>Everyone on campus seems to have an opinion on this except the white student union. Thats because there isn&rsquo;t one. The West Chester University campus wont be &#8216;diverse&rsquo; until there is one. </p>

<p>First of all, is it just me or are people waking up? It seems more and more are getting realists and look on the facts instead of &#8220;looking into their hearts&#8221;.</p>
<p>Second: Do you really believe this was a mistake? I mean this are students and they can not be such stupid. Can it be that they just tried to make a white student union but the pressure was so high that they decided to step back?</p>
<p>I mean the poster is very clear to me. This is an important point because it shows that the younger generations who are far away from 1969 are looking with more realistic eyes on the world than others. There is hope.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s still a part of me that remembers my mother&rsquo;s indignation one spring, shortly after Father&rsquo;s Day had followed Mother&rsquo;s Day, when I as a little kid asked her why there was no &#8220;Children&rsquo;s Day&#8221;. She retorted testily that EVERY day is children&rsquo;s day, and that we snotty-nosed spoiled brats hardly need a special day of our own.</p>
<p>Rightly or wrongly, I think there&rsquo;s some of that mentality toward a &#8220;White Student Union&#8221; and anything else that specifically advocates for white people. It&rsquo;s part of why I really don&rsquo;t mind Black History Month, or specific recognition for groups like the Navajo code talkeres of WWII. It reminds us that not all cowboys, Marines, fighter pilots and such were white, when normally we&rsquo;d just picture in our minds a white person doing such things.</p>
<p>A slight semantic shift to &#8220;European&#8221; Student Union would be interesting, though. Especially in these changing times.</p>

		<p>I certainly  remember the Black Student Union at my high school. They treated the whole school to performance that could be accurately defined as a hate rally, after a white liberal teacher told us to go to it.  All they did was complain, whine, threaten, and blame all of their problems on Whitey.  White Student Union?  Unthinkable. </p>

<p>Some of these large universities have dozens or more of these organisations, except none for whites. Same goes for universities where white students are a minority. It might be the same way overseas, too. They all boast of how they&rsquo;re doing everything they can to bringing diversity to campus against all odds.  </p>

		<p>Rollerson said BSU does not focus only on race,-</p>
<p>Then why call it the BLACK Student Union?  Notice she said &#8220;only&#8221;, so they DO focus on race, but not ONLY on race. Why not call it the Everybody Student Union then?</p>
<p>My personal opinion - this was used to &#8216;weed out&rsquo; those last few racially aware White &#8216;racists&rsquo; hold outs that still have pride in their race and use it to run them off the campus.  </p>

		<p>As a student at WCU I have had the pleasure of watching the last few days unfold. It started when a professor of Sociology decided that instead of just lecturing the whole period that they would do a group project against racism, this was the one group&rsquo;s project. It was never supposed to get out and even though the professor told them not to post the fliers the students decided to go through with it anyway.<br>
The whole episode would not have even been noticed had it not been for Mr. Larry Dowdy the &#8220;Executive Deputy to the President, Co-Chair of the Campus Climate Intervention Team&#8221; sending an E-mail stating the safe, inclusive, diverse, and civil environment of our campus. Besides the Black Student Union we also have the Latin American Student Association, Asian American Organization, and my personal favorite Black Men United. We are very inclusive you see.<br>
When I went around asking students around the campus their opinion on the situation they have generally been in favor of allowing such an organization. Where we go from here time will only tell.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Campus Climate Intervention Team&#8221; aka PC Nazi&rsquo;s strapped on their jackboots and roamed the campus looking for culprits and making sure there weren&rsquo;t any truth to the rumours about a so-called &#8220;White Student Union&#8221; meeting. Meanwhile, the very real campus &#8220;Black Students Union&#8221; gave out a sigh of relief and bragged how &#8220;hispanic heritage&#8221; month is celebrated on campus. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s this exact &#8220;campus climate&#8221; that partly drove me to drop out of the university I attended a little over a year ago. Just wait until I go back though because I&rsquo;m going to be so armed with even more knowledge that I&rsquo;ll give those kids a real education on &#8220;diversity.&#8221; No fear, no backing down because of succumbing to social pressure at all next time around. They won&rsquo;t soon forget what I&rsquo;ll argue.</p>

<p>there is an interesting loophole in the &#8220;law&#8221; (actually mass psychosis) according to which whites must face their existence in deference to blacks and browns:</p>
<p>we are currently still allowed to be proud of being Irish or Italian, Latvian or Swedish, Basque or Czech, just not European or European-American.</p>
<p>it would be interesting to see whether a Danish American student Union, or even a Scandinavian American student Union, would be banned by the authorities in the same way.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you just love how dishonest and deceptive and hypocritical blacks, hispanics, and the self-hating whites that support them are?  They can&rsquo;t just be honest and say &#8220;We are having a rally against white-oriented groups.&#8221;  No, no.  They have to promote a group with the complete opposite ideology of which they believe in.  </p>

		<p>Maybe an Anglo Student Union, or a Euro-American Student Union might work.  But the problem is that such a group would be constantly having to throw itself on the alter of white guilt and say it&rsquo;s not racist.  They would also probably have to admit non-whites to show diversity and inclusiveness.  Then what would be the point?</p>
<p>I think whites should apply to be members of non-white student groups and push their racism back in their faces.</p>

<p>This comment underscores the liberal, anti-white majority mindset.  All whites should &#8220;mind&#8221; since these make believe celebrations are meant to paint a false picture of our civilization, and to impart within the majority mind the idea that non-whites are, to a significant degree, responsible for both the creation and maintenance of Western civilization.  </p>
<p>It is a fraud idea from the beginning. Contributions (I mean real, significant contributions) from non-white minorities have always been minuscule.  Indeed, these non-white peoples should thank whites for the opportunity to enjoy the fruits of civilization, which they parasitically appropriate for themselves, but offer back nothing substantive in return.  Instead, they have learned to exploit the white race&rsquo;s fatal flaw: Christian guilt.</p>

I don&rsquo;t like the minority groups or stupid &#8220;holidays&#8221; like MLK day because I feel as though someone is trying to force me to recognize these people whether I agree or not. Black History month is nothing more than an excuse to try to brainwash our children (and general public) into believing blacks have made important contributions to society. I don&rsquo;t care about black history at all&hellip;not one little bit. </p>
<p>And as for the Indians&hellip;the Navajo in particular as a previous poster mentioned.  I have zero respect for them as well. When I was working as an engineer for the government (fresh from college - I didn&rsquo;t know any better), I inspected many Navajo reservations. The Navajo are so corrupt they make the US government look like saints.  Americans may not realize that their tax dollars pay for all the infrastructure on Indian reservations. The Navajo are no different than a subsidized housing complex full of black people. Their hands are out demanding money we &#8220;owe&#8221; them without participating in the required due diligence audit process the American tax payers deserve. I could tell many stories about the great &#8220;Windtalker&#8221; Navajo Indians&hellip;..none of which would make very good movies. </p>

		<p>A typical tale about racism in this society. Even the thought that whites could do what all other races do is &#8220;racist.&#8221; Yet the reality that blacks and others organize around race every day is considered civil rights. </p>
<p>This is what I don&rsquo;t get about white flag wavers and patriots. This West Chester incident IS America. Whites will always be blamed and scapegoated for the problems of others   &mdash;   especially blacks. It is getting worse not better. So why any white person would &#8220;pledge allegiance&#8221; to such a  sick and twisted country is beyond me.</p>

		<p>The Black Student Union recently celebrated Religion and Sex. Of course they do. </p>
<p>Blacks go to Church so they can scream, I mean, sing, and dance, play music as loud as they want, and just whine about the Whites.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when they get around to hearing the Word of the Gospels. Oh well, there is only so much you can do in an hour Service.</p>
<p>So, the Blacks have a Student Union named for their skin color, and we all know that La Raza, or its affiliate, is also on Campus, there, too. La Raza means &#8220;The Race&#8221; in Spanish. How inclusive. If your brown, that is. </p>
<p>But, Whites are deprived the right to form their own Student Union, without it morphing into some &#8220;Racist&#8221; group. </p>
<p>I understand that &#8220;Students for Western Civilization&#8221; get the same stuff shoveled their way, too. What utter nonsense. The White idiots doing the complaining should sit in on a meeting, or actually read some printed material, before they shoot off their big mouths, over which they know nothing about.  </p>

		<p>Discourse is the mother of invention in this case. What is obvious is that someone pointed out that white students may feel alienated and alone. Either this is a case of a very perceptive black hoax and they are reading the minds of white youth everywhere or someone white thought that it was time for some tit to go along with the tat. </p>
<p>Either way folks are talking and thinking. What would be wrong with whites meeting off campus since many have off campus apartments anyway. Whites dislike the constant racial intimidation of blacks when forced to live in dorms with them so they seek refuge in outside apartments where college influence is less prevalent. </p>
<p>Of course the Duke Lacrosse players had their own house and that didn&rsquo;t stop them from being denounced by the Duke 88. As usual that was another big lie perpetuated by the left. </p>

<p>Of course universities are going to paint any organization like a white student union as racists. What &#8220;white issues&#8221; are members going to talk about? Other student unions exist to get benefits for their own race at the expense of whites. Organized whites are naturally going to speak out against these policies. To the typical University faculty member protesting affirmative action, social justice, and the like is de facto racism. Blacks, feminists, and other leftists, are the same way. Since they whole heartedly believe &#8220;The System&#8221; was built to benefit another group by disadvantaging them, any attempts to fight their programs and return to the status quo are racist or sexist. To the college administrator then, denouncing a white student union is the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Someone needs to confront this racist and point-blank ask her WHY White students cannot have their own student union, as do blacks, hispanics and Asians.  Better, this racist policy and racist spokeswoman needs to written up in the alumni paper and disseminated to every donor.</p>
<p>I looked up West Chester &#8220;University&#8221;  (University meaning &#8220;an educational institution designed for instruction, examination, or both&#8221;, which West Chester is not) on FIRE&rsquo;s website, whose mission statement is:</p>
<p><i> to defend and sustain individual rights at America&rsquo;s colleges and universities. These rights include freedom of speech, legal equality, due process, religious liberty, and sanctity of conscience</i></p>
<p>West Chester University was given a Red Light for a speech code penalizing speech &#8216;such as a nasty remark about a person&rsquo;s race or religion.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Red Light defined as:</p>
<p><i>An institution that has at least one policy that both clearly and substantially restricts freedom of speech.</i></p>
<p>You can easily check FIRE&rsquo;s rating of your college or university on their site (red, yellow or green light) and if it has been given a Red Light, join FIRE&rsquo;s new campaign, Give Half:</p>
<p><i>Through the Give Half for Liberty campaign, you can donate half of what you usually would donate to a college or university to FIRE instead, so that we can help restore that school to the true &#8216;marketplace of ideas&rsquo; it was meant to be.</i></p>
<p>Here is a list of colleges/universities that have been affected by FIRE&rsquo;s Give Half campaign:</p>

My impression is that while few whites are &ldquo;proud to be white,&rdquo; deep down most of us are frustrated separatists. If an all-white school existed &amp; was a genuine option, the waiting list to get in would be miles long. Same with all-white neighborhoods, shops, workplaces. They don&rsquo;t exsit, but if they did&hellip; oh my, what our people wouldn&rsquo;t do to get in.</b></p>
<p>Am I wrong on this&hellip;?<br>
</p>
<p>Nope, not at all, though I would say on a subconscious level most whites prefer to be around other whites than other races of people.  This doesn&rsquo;t mean we hate them, but we don&rsquo;t want to see our women procreating with non-whites, nor do we want our lands becoming racially mixed.  It&rsquo;s just not natural and healthy.  However, we are getting really annoyed with blacks and hispanics who call us racists and hate on us, meanwhile they are using their voting power to take away our rights, liberties, and money.  This ending of white guilt and collective impatience with blacks intimidation will evenutally lead to being pro-white.</p>

<p><br>
And why not! This racist makes it sounds as if being White and assembling is a capital crime and worthy of public condemnation! How dare they deny Whites the same opportunities and privileges extended to hispanics, asians, and blacks. </p>
<p>Is their a MEChA and La Raza chapter on campus? We already know there&rsquo;s a black student union, but heaven forbid a White student union wants to assemble and address issues affecting our race!</p>
<p>This is outright discrimination!<br>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a deeper message here and it is a simple one that we Whites seem to have forgotten:  We need to organize as Whites and we need to do it at all levels of society.  We need to stop hiding who and what we are.  We needn&rsquo;t be overly strident about it; but one of our positives as a people is that we can organize.</p>
<p>And, the anti-Whites know it.  That&rsquo;s one of the reasons that they try to keep every group that we&rsquo;re involved in looking like the Star Wars Bar.</p>

Uh,No you won`t&hellip; Not that I don`t want you to. Not that I`m not on your side. None of that. But because you will find that as a &#8220;returning student&#8221; you will be segregated on an entirely different campus, attending school at an entirely different time. In my own case it was a high school three miles from the campus that my University had rented, even though their own halls were empty at that hour. In our orientation, it was even explained to us that we were being &#8220;isolated&#8221; because our opinions that we had formed as adults, were not in line with what the school wanted the new 18 year olds to be inculcated with. It was explained to us that they were being groomed as a new &#8220;global&#8221; generation, which I found later was ust code speak for anti-White.<br>
 They even didn`t want us coming on to the campus to buy our books. We had an &#8220;approved&#8221; bookstore to shop at. When I violated this policy out of convience, rather than conviction I was immediately accosted by a teacher who recognized me for the adult eduaction program. Which started for anyone, I believe who was over 23 when returning to campus. Good Luck and I hope this helps you in some way&hellip;</p>

<p><i>I could tell many stories about the great &ldquo;Windtalker&rdquo; Navajo Indians&hellip;..none of which would make very good movies. </i></p>
<p>I encourage you to post some of your dealings with the Navajo here just so your anecdotal experiences may become part of the historical record. When I was pretty young (just out of college myself) I was part of a summer effort to help buil and renovate government housing for the Indians at the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation.  Dozens of volunteers (all white) from all over the country and indeed, even the world, came to the Dakotas to help these desperately poor people whom the government &#8216;forgot&rsquo; winterize the homes.  The first morning we were told to leave our backpacks and luggage in the school gym while we toured the reservation by bus, but to be sure we took our wallets, purses, cameras, and other valuables.  It was explained to us that although the gym doors would be locked, nothing in there was &#8216;safe&rsquo; from the Indian teens who would most likely gain entrance into the gym from the ceiling and would be able to rifle through our possessions and steal from us.  They did.  Things went downhill from that point on-an experience none of us will ever forget!  Although the Native American &#8216;officials&rsquo; in the Dakotas seemed to be somewhat responsible (despite their inability to keep appointments or work a full day for their salaries) I wasn&rsquo;t privy to their ability to &#8216;steal&rsquo; from the government &#8216;at will.&rsquo;  (I suspected it though.) If you have some examples of official malfeasance on the part of responsible adults, or even some thoughts as the truly dysfunctional nature of Native American culture in general   &mdash;   please share your experiences as time permits and wherever appropriate.<br>

		<p>As long as whites are a majority on a campus, they will feel no need to form a club to promote their interests.  (Sort of why there&rsquo;s no &#8216;white&rsquo; American movement in the country right now.  Most whites think they are still the majority.)</p>
<p>For all our complaining about the lack of commitment of white youth, though, the proof is in the pudding.  They may be crazy liberals who preach diversity and white guilt, but at the end of the day they pretty much only hang around other whites, with an odd gay black friend or asian &#8216;honorary white&rsquo; there.  (I see this all the time: white twenty-somethings in all white settings, even in this mostly non-white urban area.)</p>
<p>The fact is, these young white liberals lead lives apart from non-whites, no matter what they say, and for the same reasons we all know here: different cultural groups do not and cannot mix easily.  Group values are not mutable and fluid.  Human psychology is rigid when it comes to group identity and cohesion.  This is an evolutionary survival mechanism: fear the other.</p>
<p>In the same way that blacks cry about wanting endless &#8216;good&rsquo; examples of other blacks to emulate, or asians want to have cultural clubs to express their &#8216;heritage&rsquo; or latinos ache for endless &#8216;connections&rsquo; with their home countries, whites naturally flock together by cultural pattern.</p>
<p>The young liberal whites don&rsquo;t realize this, and go on being hypocrites - calling for diversity but not even practicing it themselves - but they&rsquo;re young.  Most young people are stupid until they get enough experience to begin to see the world for what it is.  Then they become people like us, at least most do, as continued housing patterns and rising private school enrollment in even liberal areas attest to.</p>
<p>An excellent example of this hidden white solidarity is in the Survivor TV show.  Every time they have blacks on the show, the young liberal whites build an invisible wall against them due to their loudness, crudeness and bold ways.  </p>
<p>If you get the chance, watch a few episodes, particularly of this season (Survivor Nicaragua) and it practically jumps off the screen at you.  </p>
<p>Our young whites are clueless in general, but despite what they say and call for, most prefer the company of other whites and these are the Tea Party voters of 20 years from now.</p>

		<p>Most Whites, while actively pursuing alternate versions of desired &#8220;change,&#8221; passively acknowledge the legitimacy of existing, de facto governments, currencies and media. Let no honest person shrug off the CSA&rsquo;s never surrendered government, Appomattox notwithstanding. Those occupation forces did not dare put President Jefferson Davis on trial for treason; he lived out his days in quiet dignity, as did Robert E. Lee. &#8220;You lost, get over it,&#8221; they tell us Whites. &#8220;Then why,&#8221; we reply, &#8220;are you trying to convince us, IF what you say is a de jure fact?&#8221; The Confederacy is still fighting today, at this later time and in its present form. The First Freedom, simply an honest monthly tabloid, brings you that news on where and how the continuing struggle for justice is happening now, and it&rsquo;s FREE at www.firstfreedom.net/1.pdf . You owe yourself this much &#8220;change.&#8221; Turn off that stupid television for about thirty days, peruse the current issue of TFF, rethink the word nation and the unfinished business now at hand for most of our Western nations.</p>

		<p>As an Indian (dot, not feather), I have nothing against the white student union. I belong to the Indian Student Union and I feel white should have the same rights as I do. I am very ashamed to share the name &#8220;Indian&#8221; with the native tribes of the U.S. We are far smarter and better behaved than them. I am very sorry for what happened to the posters who were victimized by the Navajos. Please trust that our kind of Indian is hard working and intelligent and nothing like our native namesakes.</p>
