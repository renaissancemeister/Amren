<h1><a href="https://www.cireport.ca/2010/12/thor-trailer-released-as-multicultural.html">Shocking Multi-Kulti Thor Trailer Released</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Canadian Immigration Report, December 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The first trailer for Thor was recently released, and true to reports a few months ago, will prominently feature an African as Heimdall. Ironically &#8220;the whitest of the gods&#8221; in Norse mythology, a minor furor erupted when the role was given to Afro-British actor Idris Elba, immediately setting comment boards aflame and prompting the creation of a Facebook page.</p>
<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="WhiteGod.jpg" src="/news/2010/12/13/WhiteGod.jpg" width="627" height="356" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></span><div style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Norse god Heimdall, as imagined by Hollywood.</strong></div></p>
<p>Although the film is undoubtedly based on the popular Marvel comic book series, Northern European mythology has enjoyed an important revival in recent years and this multiethnic take on the kingdom of Asgard has left many fans aghast. While it is true that modern iterations of Norse mythology have taken liberties such as painting Thor&rsquo;s traditional red beard a more appealing blond, a good number of fans of the series appreciate having a foot firmly planted in the established tradition of the mythical tales. Reinventing a multiracial Norse canon is deeply insulting to an already wounded and dying European culture</p>
<p>As it has been established that race has no bearing in a storytelling context, would the public accept this as the next version of Roots?</p>
<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="roots.png" src="/news/2010/12/13/roots.png" width="291" height="400" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></span></p>

		<p> The people in Hollywood seem to be trying to insult, demean and denigrate every white person in the world in any form, fashion, way or manner possible.<br>
 This is inexcusable on so many different planes it makes a thinking person with any knowledge of Norse mythology want to throw up in disgust.</p>

		<p>So the &#8220;whitest of all gods&#8221; in European mythology is played by a black person.  Okay.  But what kind of reaction would ensue if a Hollywood production involving the &#8220;blackest of all gods&#8221; in African mythology was played by a white person?</p>

		<p>It is truly amazing that ink is wasted on this trivial nonsense when it is a historical fact that various white cultures were literally ethnically cleansed from their urban neighborhoods during the last several generations using rape, murder, and worse by non-whites as a sort of biological weapon, to get them to move into generic &#8220;white&#8221; neighborhoods in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Whites have LITERALLY been stripped of our culture in the US, and that fact sanitized from the history books with little to no resistance and almost no remembrance of who we are, where we came from, our history, our culture, our past.</p>
<p>Instead, we complain about a comic book.  Hey, here&rsquo;s an idea.  Don&rsquo;t like it?  Don&rsquo;t watch the movie.  Instead, spend time googling the situation I just described and gathering various out of print books that used to be published on this.  Spread that knowledge to others.</p>

		<p>Multi-cult is the ultimate expression of white supremacism. In essence what the perveyors of diversity are saying is that every other ethnic group on Earth has the right to lay exclusive claim to its own history and culture but not Europeans. The West is too important to be claimed by any one group. It is universal, and allowing white Europeans to feel as though it belongs to them would be aggressive and highly demoralizing to other peoples.</p>

		<p>They did the same thing with that movie &#8220;300&#8221;, about Thermopylae, a couple of years back.  Thermopylae is one of the greatest historical events, because it typifies, bravery, manhood, duty, and sacrifice for one&rsquo;s people.  Hollywood turned it into a multicultural, transsexual abomination.   </p>

		<p> Political correctness and multi-culturalism conquers all! Yes, of course, Northern Europe in Norse mythology days, which didn&rsquo;t have a black living within a thousand miles, must have an African as one of the chief gods (the &#8220;Whitest god&#8221; at that, God save the mark!) It reminds me of the film version of &#8220;Much Ado About Nothing&#8221; from a few years ago which had Denzel Washington as a 16th Century Italian nobleman. Bet there were just oodles of them, don&rsquo;t you think?!</p>
<p> Here&rsquo;s hoping the film reviewed, more or less, in this posting, gets the derision and ridicule it deserves. But given the brainwashed mindset of so many of nowadays&rsquo; White young people who will make up its main audience, I doubt that it will.</p>

		<p>I find this a direct racial insult as I am of Nordic descent.  The Norse Gods were NOT black.  As far as I&rsquo;m concerned this is nothing short of a hate crime against my people and heritage, and I won&rsquo;t be going to see this travesty.</p>

		<p>This is incredibly insulting to the Germanic peoples who descend from the Norse. The Norse gods were NOT African, Asian, etc they were white as snow and as Germanic as it got. I refuse to watch this movie to see my ancestors&rsquo; beliefs and culture butchered before my eyes. Our heritage is insulted and this will only confuse already confused young Euro-Americans. Our history is continuously &ldquo;corrected&rdquo; to include everyone. If I see one more historical film where they have blacks or Asians in medieval or ancient Europe, I am going to flip. Would they have Angelina Jolie play Amaterasu?How about Will Smith play Buddha? Eh? I&rsquo;m sure that would make sense. Heimdall belong to no one but Europeans, Africans had nothing to do with him.</p>
<p><br>
Our culture and people are dying, what is left is being destroyed, disfigured, and stolen from us. It is exhausting to have to explain to other whites how incorrect things are; it has even come to the point where many don&rsquo;t even know they are European. We may not be a minority in blood yet, but for everything else that matters, we are a total minority and fading quickly.<br>

		<p>If Marvel must have blacks somewhere, to the point of turning Heimdall and Nick Fury black, why not make a Black Panther or Power Man movie? </p>
<p>Well, I was a major Marvel Comics fan back when I was a kid, and I like most of their recent movies, so I guess I&rsquo;ll check out Thor anyway. </p>
<p>If there is enough negative reaction about black Heimdall, Marvel has an escape route. Since Heimdall is a god, he can always change his appearance, can&rsquo;t he? </p>

		<p>Making the lead character a black would be perfectly fine with me if it was a black-produced movie aimed at blacks. It&rsquo;s the absconding of white characters and traditions and turning them black is what is so damnably offensive! Make your own movies and characters and then you can have them any color you want, but don&rsquo;t take over my people&rsquo;s legends and traditions!</p>
<p>I hope this film meets with the failure it deserves.</p>

		<p>If you do not like a black playing Heimdall, then do not go see it.  In todays toxic pc climate, if your friends say they want to go see it, simply say you heard it wasn&rsquo;t very good.  The only way to keep stuff from like this happening over and over again is for everybody involved to lose money.</p>

<p>Interesting idea, and quite true.  It fits into the current set of articles on Amren, particularly the one about how a blonde haried, blue eyed cartoon is an insult to women of color because it celebrates white female beauty.  There is something in primitive people that makes them not just envious of beauty in another, but must possess it, and failing that destroy it.  All the blonde wigs and expensive braiding will not ever bring a black woman to the level of an average girl-next-door white female.  So they must be suppressed and ultimately destroyed.</p>
<p>This also fits into the post here by 1  &mdash;  Anonymous wrote at 6:56 PM;  What you are not realizing is how popular this series has been in Britain.  Media has been one of the relentless tools of the very genocide you describe.  Every attack, no matter how trivial it might seem to someone not involved, matters. </p>
<p>Media is the main tool, the artillery, if you will, that precedes laws and social attitudes that are the cause of this remarkable, legally veted process of white genocide.  From the white girls pledged to have &#8220;Obama babies&#8221; to the Feminists who preached while genocide through the rejection of white husbands (like Obama&rsquo;s mother), a steady campaign of unrelenting propaganda aimed at wearing down the will of whites to see themselves as white goes on.  Over the weekend I caught parts, enough, of a satellite tv movie called &#8220;The Color of Love.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s all about a blonde white woman who fights to keep her black baby from the now married black man who knocked her up.  She is taken through all the phases, along with her parents and all the other white people in the film.  But the end result is a bunch of white people helping to raise, sharing in the wonderful work of raising a black baby with a black family, a truly well engineered piece of propaganda, except when you wonder why this white woman wasn&rsquo;t using birth control since she was a &#8220;sexually active single woman.&#8221;  Never mind the plot difficulties, the message is that it is wonderful to have black babies because it brings everyone together.  Your anti-racist feel good movie for this Christmas season.</p>
<p>Next, a panel of NAACP executives ask,&#8221;Why are there no black snowmen at Christmas?</p>

		<p>I am not surprised.  Marvel creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby (secret identities Stan Lieber and Jerome Kirbowitz) were always leftist and leaned toward political correctness.  DC comics was also founded by leftist Jews.  From the top down, they all made sure their employees did not stray far from their views, just like newspaper editors and publishers.  </p>
<p>Marvel in particular led the way for race integration in comics, introducing a large number of black heroes, even if they were mostly sidekicks.  Stan Lee once remarked in the 1970&rsquo;s that the wide appeal of Spiderman was due to his being completely hidden behind the costume, so his race could be anything.  Obviously, bridging the race divide has been on Lee&rsquo;s mind for a long time.  </p>
<p>In a TV interview I saw just a few years ago, Lee stated about Marvel Comics, &#8220;we were fighting the Nazis before anyone else [in the US] was.&#8221;  Indeed, Marvel heroes like Captain America were smashing Germans (and their evil leader, The Red Skull) almost a decade before USA entered WWII.  His distaste for whiteness (and that of other leftist Jews in the media) may stem in part from that early struggle against white racial consciousness.</p>
<p>I was an avid comics collector for 30 years until, in about 1995, I suddenly realized who had been writing my beloved comics and what their cultural/political bias was.  I think it was an interracial kiss covering an entire page of a Spiderman book that became the final straw for me.  I haven&rsquo;t bought a comic book since and have (mostly) boycotted the Marvel movies.  Marvel is as left as left gets.</p>

		<p>The idea behind this movie is to separate White people from their identity.  A few years ago I believe it was Denzel Washington starring in a Broadway play in NYC about Caesar with Washington playing a Roman and at almost the same time the movie &#8220;The Honeymooners&#8221; was released.  The Honeymooners starred all White people and among them were Jackie Gleason, Art Carney, Audrey Meadows and Joyce Randolph.  When these types of movies are made, the purpose behind it is to relieve us of our racial identity so that 50 or 100 or 150 years hence we are completely deracinated as a people and therefore destroyed.</p>

		<p>Hollywood has been going down the tubes fast. I agree with Anonymous (10) about the &ldquo;300&rdquo; movie. Another totally botched remake was &ldquo;Clash of the Titans&rdquo; (2010) and was an insult to Ray Harryhausen. Remember the remake of the The Honeymooners (2005), the cast was ALL black. Really! Some things just aren&rsquo;t interchangeable, and that idea was totally ridicules. Also remember the remake of &ldquo;Flight of the Phoenix&rdquo; (2004)? They replaced the (1964) co-pilot  which was a reclusive alcoholic that had low self esteem with a mouthy aggressive black man. Really! When was the last time that you have seen a black pilot? Answer- you haven&rsquo;t, because they cant make the grade and you cant affirmative action ANYBODY into a pilots position because there is too much riding on it. I have found that the majority of new movies are aimed at the 16-25 age group that know nothing about the originals or what real motion picture making is all about.</p>

		<p>  I seems like there is a concentrated effort to remake European and American History in black face. If trends continue, I predict that one day Hollywood&rsquo;s classic movies may be remade to be more diverse with popular black and Latino actors digitized to replace: Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Myrna Loy, Burt Lancaster, Norma Shearer, Joan Fontaine, et al   &mdash;   sort of like Woody Allen in &ldquo;Zelig&rdquo;. </p>

		<p>Like most people here, I grew up reading Marvel Comic books. </p>
<p>Today, after this insult to European Mythology, my children will no longer be allowed to read their Comics, or watch anything related to Marvel Comics. </p>
<p>Maybe the next insult to our unique Mythology will be the Greco-Roman gods such as Zeus-Jupiter, Posiden-Neptune, and Hermes-Mercury will be Black, or Oriental.</p>
<p>Should I expect to see the &#8220;Lucky Charms&#8221; Leprechaun, or the &#8220;Fighting Irish&#8221; mascot as a &#8220;Brotha&#8221;, too? How disgusting.</p>
<p>There is one major reason Blacks, among the rest of these non-Whites, push themselves onto our Culture, because they   recognize it as being Superior to all others. </p>
<p>If that is not so, then why did the little brown troll want so desperately to be cast as a &#8220;Hobbit&#8221; in the new &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; movie? </p>
<p>Now, to all White Nationalists with Artistic talent, here is your cue to create your own Comic books, to compete with these sell-outs, and make a good dollar while doing it. </p>
<p>What could be better for talented White Artists, than to preserve their Mythologies, and unique European cultures, while making a good living? </p>

		<p>I am not surprised. Marvel creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby (secret identities Stan Lieber and Jerome Kirbowitz) were always leftist and leaned toward political correctness. DC comics was also founded by leftist Jews. From the top down, they all made sure their employees did not stray far from their views, just like newspaper editors and publishers. </p>
<p>Yes Stan and Jack were jewish but you have to admit King Kirby could draw the best aryans. What Stan and Jack did in the 60&rsquo;s would be considered super conservative today.</p>

		<p>Content #33 and Sardonicus #34: Here are shining examples why I own a great collection of Classic Movies freaturing all the greatest White American Actors such as John Wayne, and Jimmy Stewart, Gary Cooper, James Cagney, among so many others.</p>
<p>My kids have never seen the garbage that is pushed on the rest of America&rsquo;s White children. No, they get to watch the original &#8220;Honeymooners&#8221;, and love every episode. </p>
<p>If we need to mix it up, we can always watch the Classic, &#8220;This is the Army&#8221; starring Ronald Reagan, and Alan Hale, Sr. We all love the part of the Movie, during the &#8220;Soldiers&rsquo; Show&#8221; where White Servicemen wear Black-face, and oversized bow ties, and straw hats, while dancing the soft shoe in front of a giant Banjo. </p>
<p>This is a great tool for re-educating White youth to what should be quite obvious. So, use it. </p>

		<p>Giving money to Hollywood is insane for any white person.  If it wasn&rsquo;t on for free at a Hotel, we&rsquo;d buy movies at rummage sales for churches or the Health Food Co-op (that way we KNEW not a cent went to Hollywood, and there was no chance of boosting their sales figures).  Now, while we can, we watch movies on Youtube.  Once that window closes, we&rsquo;ll go back to dollar DVDs from rummage sales.</p>
<p>And has anyone noticed how movies from as late as the Nineties seem to be from another world? &hellip;.a world where there is no mandatory requirement for deep-voiced black heroes (with white girls clinging to them) and repulsive blond villains? </p>

		<p>I for one refuse to watch movies that cast non-whites where they do not belong, such as characters in Greek, Roman, Slavic or any other European people&rsquo;s mythology. Casting non-whites in these roles is an insult, I and anyone else who has Ukrainian and Russian ancestry would take great offense at a black man being cast as the Cossack leader Taras Bulba for example. What this amounts to is an in our faces attack on our identity. When our rights, freedoms, lives and identities are attacked, all we have left is violence, revolution and brutal wars ahead for us. We must boycott these movies, and I rarely go to theaters anymore. I buy older movies on DVD, movies that do not mock me, my heritage and my identity.</p>

		<p>If you want a good film about Nordic mythology, watch Ofelas. Set 1000 years ago in Lapland, it&rsquo;s a coming of age story about heroism, revenge and self-sacrifice for one&rsquo;s people. No CGI or big named actors. Just a compelling tale amidst the stunning beauty of a pristine landscape and a clear blue sky.</p>

		<p>The new movie <i>Unstoppable</i> is based on the CSX 8888 incident, the runaway train stopped by White men, not anyone resembling Denzel Washington, nor a train master resembling Rosario Dawson.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a photo of the real train master, Jon Hosfeld, see if you can spot any resemblance to Rosario Dawson.  I couldn&rsquo;t:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2er6k4z" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2er6k4z</a></p>
<p><i>CSX trainmaster, Jon Hosfeld, was able to run alongside at a road crossing just south of Kenton, pull himself aboard Engine 8888, and stop it.</i></p>
<p>Another movie multi-culted by Hollyweird, White history assigned to non-Whites who do not have the brains to stop a run a way train, let alone design and build one.</p>

		<p>I am of Germanic and Norse descent.  This movie is insulting to me.  I will, sadly, have to boycott it.  I love mythology, but I know I will not be able to maintain the fantasy with an out-of-place actor in a white-origin story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick of seeing black characters in movies all the time now out of all historical or realistic context.  Here are some examples:</p>
<p>2012 has a lead black scientist, black president, and black female sympathy character.  The white man shown there is a bumbling fool who barely saves his family.  Only Africa survives the disaster.</p>
<p>The Patriot has black soldiers in uniform on both the american and british sides, mixed in with the whites like they were considered equals.</p>
<p>Percy Jackson and the Lightening thief has a black satyr and persephone is black.</p>
<p>The Day After Tomorrow has a black president and only Africa and Latin America survive the disaster and white people need them to exist.</p>
<p>Movies like the Book of Eli or all those Will Smith movies have an improbable black hero.  The list goes on and on and it gets worse with TV shows.  </p>
<p>I sure hope they don&rsquo;t make black hobbits in the new Tolkein move!</p>

		<p>A few years ago, Fox had a (mercifully) short-lived series, called &#8220;Roar&#8221; (I believe that was the name), set in Ireland in the Middle Ages. It was one of those sword-and-sorcery shows.</p>
<p>What I found amusing was they had black actors in some of the parts. I wondered how they could show Bantus in medieval Ireland, since no blacks existed in Ireland in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>On a sidebar, I remember Roger Ebert raging against the movie &#8220;Conan the Brabarian&#8221;, not because he thought it was a bad movie, but he was upset because Conan cut off Thulsa Doom&rsquo;s head (portrayed by James Earl Jones), and kicked it down the stairs of the temple.</p>
<p>Roger Ebert is married to a black woman, so he has to play the race card.</p>

		<p>Although I am no fan of the pagan Norwegian gods, the fact that people think they can portray a Scandinavian god as a BLACK MAN simply disgusts me.  Actually, it confuses me.  I know its a fiction movie, but it still has to be at least nominally believable.</p>
<p>&#8220;They did the same thing with that movie &ldquo;300&rdquo;, about Thermopylae, a couple of years back. Thermopylae is one of the greatest historical events, because it typifies, bravery, manhood, duty, and sacrifice for one&rsquo;s people.

<p>I saw &#8220;300&#8221; a few times, and I don&rsquo;t remember any pro-multiculturalist garbage.  In fact, the movie portrayed 300 white Greeks fighting heroically to the death AGAINST hundreds of thousands of dark-skinned Persians, and their homosexual, makeup-wearing Emperor Xerxes.  Quite the opposite of the &#8220;multicultural, transsexual abomination&#8221; you mention.</p>
