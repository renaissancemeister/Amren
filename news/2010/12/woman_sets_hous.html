<h1>Woman Sets House on Fire After Being Locked Out, Police Say</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WTAE-TV (Pittsburgh), November 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A woman has been charged with arson after Pittsburgh police said she set a house that she owns on fire after locking herself out.</p>
<p>Firefighters {snip} were able to prevent the fire from spreading to adjacent row houses.</p>
<p>Police said they arrived at the scene and were told by fire officials that Lorean Simmons, 57, of Verona, told responding officers that she had started the fire.</p>
<p>Simmons indicated that she ignited the awning so the fire bureau would respond and open her door, but then called 911 after the fire started because she did not want the whole house to burn, police said.</p>

		<p>Does Lorean have a job? Would people pay her money for legal work? How does she get to own a house?</p>
<p>That aside, here is proof that IQ is but one of many measures of intelligence, and that attracting attention to obtain help from two public service agencies is almost as good as remembering one&rsquo;s keys. If she ever appears in court, a quick IQ test will absolve her from punishment, again showing that low IQ is no handicap. </p>

		<p>My parents&rsquo; first house they bought was in Verona, PA.  It used to be so nice, most of Pittsburgh was (a fair amount still is).  My dad used to tell me about being able to walk the streets (except the Hill District) at 4am without being bothered (and this was in the mid 80&rsquo;s).  Now, although it is still mostly nice, it is getting worse.  They are settling Kurds and Somalis there now.  You know we can never get enough of them.  </p>
<p>Pittsburgh was (and still might be) our last bastion of a white metropolis on the east side of the U.S.  And unlike Portland or Seattle it was/is not full of looney lefties who think you are a nazi if less than 25% of the men you slept with wasn&rsquo;t black.  I have a friend that moved there (Seattle) and this is what some beautiful blonde haired, blue eyed women have told her.  I used to want to move to Portland or Seattle for the whiteness.  Any suggestions from my fellow Amreners?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s as I&rsquo;ve written many times:  A group average I.Q. reported as 85 is obviously inflated.  That&rsquo;s way too high.</p>
<p>What does she do when she needs a car wash after everything is closed?  Let me guess.  She drives off the end of a pier.</p>

		<p>This is the logic of a four year old child who has yet to understand the workings of daily life. Her facial expression reveals the IQ of a tomato plant behind it. I would wager that this dullard is clueless as to why she is being arrested&hellip;&#8221;Wha? Iss mah house!&#8221;</p>

<p>If she were very attractive, you might be unwittingly selling her. She&rsquo;s not, though. She looks quite unattractive physically, too. </p>

		<p>Another sterling example of high IQ distribution in this race. Where I live, we have a timed gate operated by pass card to let in people and cars.  Naturally some brilliant rocket scientist tried to tailgate right behind me one night (despite explicit sign posted in English which warn people against doing this), got the front of his car smashed up-and tried to blame me the f  &mdash;  - white b  &mdash;    &mdash;   for it. If BREATHING wasn&rsquo;t an automatic process, some of these people wouldn&rsquo;t do it!</p>

		<p>I urge all posters on AMREN to look at post #5 here, read it over thoughtfully.  Ruminate on it.  And let the import of that astute observation really sink in.  </p>
<p>As I cruise around this major east coast urban area, populated as it is 95% by non-whites of all types, I look at all the architecture, homes and other public spaces, all built by whites (and inhabited by them) up until about 50 years ago, and I wonder about a world that has now passed away&hellip;America, land of the free and home of the &hellip;?</p>
<p>Who would have thought the 80s were the last decade of a truly prosperous and dedicated America?  Now our nation has been given away for 40 years, piece by piece - death by a thousand cuts.  Does anyone here seriously think that in 20-30 years there will be any difference between our situation here, and that of the whites in South Africa?</p>
