<h1>Domestic Violence Laws Compound Immigrants&rsquo; Culture Shock</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sandra Tan, Buffalo News, December 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A refugee from Somalia was accused of trying to sell her 16-year-old daughter into marriage against her will.</p>
<p>Social Services took another Somali couple&rsquo;s six children because the father belt-whipped his 8-year-old son and tied him up for misbehaving in school.</p>
<p>A Yemeni husband beat his wife and threw her down the stairs for talking back to him in front of the family.</p>
<p>&#8220;How else can I teach her how to behave?&#8221; the bewildered man asked in court.</p>
<p>These and other cases like them are raising the concerns of judges, lawyers and human services providers in Buffalo.</p>
<p>Erie County Family Court judges say they have seen a startling rise in the number of domestic abuse and juvenile delinquency cases involving immigrant, refugee and Muslim families who want help but fear police intervention.</p>
<p>In the immigrants&rsquo; native countries, these incidents would be considered common social and cultural practices. But in their new home, they are classified as abuse and felony assault.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t come from another city; we come from another planet,&#8221; aid Burma refugee Law Eh Soe. &#8220;In Burma, you can hit your your wife or kid, but here, it&rsquo;s a crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many foreign abusers hold victims hostage by threatening their immigration status in this country, said Shea Post, the victim services outreach coordinator for the International Institute resettlement agency. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Soe added that services such as counseling are culturally unrecognizable to foreigners from conflict-ridden countries who liken extensive personal questioning to interrogation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The problem is serious enough that a special community and courts collaborative was formed 10 months ago to improve services to this newer population. The group recently hosted a daylong workshop in Buffalo for Family Court judges, lawyers and social service workers.</p>

		<p>Blatant Lies-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Another lawyer, Wallace Wiens of Neighborhood Legal Services, recounted an incident where an African refugee&rsquo;s disabled daughter wound up pregnant by another local male refugee, and questions of consent arose.</p>
<p>The grandmother, who was seeking custody, did not comprehend that lack of consent would be considered a crime in this country. She was pressured by male elders to let the matter drop and allow the father to have the child, Wiens said.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>They differentiated between cultural standards and the actual teachings of the Islamic faith, which condemns family violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Domestic violence is not acceptable in Islam, or really any faith tradition,&#8221; Arman said.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Islam has specific methods deemed appropriate for beating one&rsquo;s wife-</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/5ecx47" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/5ecx47</a></p>
<p>And the &#8216;Blessed&rsquo; Aisha, Who At _9_ was consumated into a marriage arranged for her at SIX-</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/26h3ghu" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/26h3ghu</a></p>
<p>Seems to make it clear that conceiving a child with a child is &#8216;perfectly alright&rsquo; by the Prophet&rsquo;s own actions.</p>
<p>How can it be that a faith which is supposedly so strongly moral stands by while these standards of &#8216;aculturated&rsquo; behavior continue?  Hasn&rsquo;t Islam been active in Africa since at least the 1200s when they began _slave trading_ there?</p>
<p>Could it be that &#8216;the faith&rsquo;, like the culture, is dedicated to exploitation and predation of the weak as lawful?</p>
<p>WHY do we need to immigrate people to our lands whose &#8216;cultural isolation&rsquo; is guaranteedd because 90+% of them are not attractive and lack the SES to ever be interbred with the rest of us?</p>
<p>Where does the law say that because someone can&rsquo;t run their own country we have to adopt their 70IQ mentality which &#8216;doesn&rsquo;t understand&rsquo; that tossing your family members down a flight of stairs is wrong?</p>
<p>Idiots foisting their enablement industry interests off on the rest of us.</p>

		<p>This story reminds me of how my Slovenian friends described the way Bosnians (Muslims), treated their women; &#8220;Beat her when she&rsquo;s bad, and beat her when she is good, just to make sure that she isn&rsquo;t bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>All these Western women converting to Islam have no idea what living in a real Islamic culture is like.  </p>

		<p>The solution to the problem isn&rsquo;t workshops.  The solution to the problem is to DEPORT them, and tell them to tell their tribes at home to STAY THERE.  These people are nothing like us culturally, ethically, morally, or mentally.  They never WILL be.  They contribute NOTHING to our society.  They are a net loss.  There is NO POINT to allowing them to come here.  Except, of course, the liberals and progressives are more than willing to destroy America as long as they can import enough votes to stay in power forever.  In their view, better to rule over a third world country as one of the elites than to serve as a representative in what was the richest, most free, most vibrant HOMOGENEOUS Christian country in the world.  We Whites are too fickle for them.  Eventually they go a bridge too far, and we vote them out of power.   If only, if only they could import enough guaranteed votes looking for handouts, the liberals can then stay in power through meaningless elections, and do their will without worrying about the next election.  We are nearly there folks.  If we don&rsquo;t turn this around NOW, we are lost in this generation and forever.</p>

		<p>Silly white liberals don&rsquo;t think about the cultural backwardness of these new immigrant groups they have foisted on America.  If these &#8220;new Americans&#8221; abusive cultures clash with that of our own there is no doubt which culture the left would favor.

		<p>&ldquo;Social Services took another Somali couple&rsquo;s six children because the father belt-whipped his 8-year-old son and tied him up for misbehaving in school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, that is just not done here anymore, and perhaps Mr. Somali should have thought about this before he moved here. In a country where blacks have endless &ldquo;rights&rdquo; when legitimately convicted for murder and rape, it is not unusual that the Somali should be in jail for this. It is &ldquo;equality,&rdquo; and &ldquo;enrichment,&rdquo; coming together under the banner of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Funny how that banner always hangs over a prison of one kind, or another!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p><i>However, social service and legal advocates say immigrants and refugees face&hellip; cultural differences, post-traumatic stress, generational power struggles, language barriers, immigrant community pressure and family isolation   &mdash;   child neglect, abuse, family violence and juvenile delinquency are rampant.</i></p>
<p>Family Court Judge Lisa Bloch Rodwin asks:</p>
<p><i>How do we bridge the gap between behaviors which are accepted between spouses in other cultures, but which are not acceptable or legal here?</i></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the simple solution:  Put an immediate stop to the importation of 3rd World refugees into the United States and repatriate those who were wrongly brought here to struggle in an &#8216;incompatible&rsquo; culture.</p>
<p>And, for you lucky folks in Buffalo, (such as our own sbuffalonative), there&rsquo;s this:</p>
<p>Refugee resettlement agencies receive MORE money per refugee by participating in the Preferred Communities Program which &#8216;settles&rsquo; special populations, defined as refugees who are:</p>
<p><i>youth and young adults without parents or permanent guardians who have spent an unusually long period under refugee camp conditions; refugees experiencing social or psychological conditions including emotional trauma resulting from war; refugees who are HIV+; or other populations with physical disabilities or medical conditions</i></p>
<p>Preferred refugee communities include:  Albany, <b>Buffalo</b>, and Syracuse.</p>
<p>America cannot afford more refugees or immigrants.  Unemployment is at an all-time high and rising.  The US is trillions is debt; states and cities are broke.  Millions of legal, illegal immigrants and refugees are on welfare, draining the economy.  Americans don&rsquo;t have the money to support incompatible Third World hoards who want to come here and live off of Free White Money.</p>
<p>Refugee agencies should be disbanded and criminalized.</p>

Allowing the female to consume his body is a behavior that contributes to the male mantis&rsquo; genetic survival. The male will die soon in the winter, and his body tissue will be used to enhance the female&rsquo;s egg production. This increases the quantity and quality of his offspring. </p>
<p>Thus the male mantis is not a victim of female malice; unlike the males of some other species.</p>

		<p>My prediction as to what will happen is this: Since it would clog the courts and eat up an excessive amount of police &amp; social services to deal with this type of domestic violence the following will occur. The police and social agencies will realize that they cannot make these people behave to our standards. Since they cannot deport them back to whatever 3rd world dump they come from, they will turn on middle class Americans. There will be unofficial &#8220;discipline quotas&#8221; and the police and social agencies will really start cracking down on white &#8220;domestic violence&#8221;. Let&rsquo;s say you have a 3 yo child and are shopping at the local mall. He starts to run into traffic and you trip him. Instead of becoming a hood ornament, this child now has some small road rash. However, this was documented on one of those big brother cameras that are ubiquitous. The next day, two policemen and three bureaucrats from a social services agency show up on your doorstep. The end result is a threat of fines, possible court time and even a hint of your children being taken away. At a minimum, you have to attend &#8220;parenting&#8221; classes, even though you have never had any contact with law enforcement outside of a speeding ticket. </p>
<p>Repeat after me: ENOCH WAS RIGHT! </p>

Once again they put the onus on US to accomodate THEM. In fact the whole article is one big pity-fest for these &#8216;refugees&rsquo;.

		<p>Our leaders are so afraid of offending someone, anyone, with commentary that is not complimentary to some group.  Why is it that we find it politically incorrect to criticize multicultural wife beating, honor killing, ghetto don&rsquo;t snitch, latina teen pregnancy, lack of concern about education or social morals?  Clearly there are behavior that are anti-social and unacceptable to a healthy society.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Social Services took another Somali couple&rsquo;s six children because the father belt-whipped his 8-year-old son and tied him up for misbehaving in school.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
The part about having six children I can believe   &mdash;   and also of course the stuff about being totally clueless about Western customs and norms   &mdash;   but the rest of the above smells fishy to me: </p>
<p>You mean to tell me we took in a bunch of Africans that actually resembles a nuclear family complete with a FATHER WHO LIVES WITH THEM? </p>
<p>And that African father actually TAKES AN INTEREST in the behavior and schooling of his children? </p>
<p>And you say the guy even owns a BELT? </p>
<p>Based on what I&rsquo;ve seen of Somali &#8220;refugees&#8221;   &mdash;   who, being both African AND Muslim renders them the most worthless and incompatible of ALL immigrants   &mdash;   I find all of these stories about married, live-at-home fathers who not only know their children&rsquo;s names but even make an effort to discipline them, well, it&rsquo;s all pretty credibility-stretching. </p>

		<p>Its worse than that Mr Campbell- the typical &#8220;domestic violence&#8221; incident starts when a husband and wife have a minor arguement, she will not let it die and continues to yell at him and when she tries to block the door he shoves her out of the way. The next day at work she mentions the incident to a feminist coworker who would hardly let a man touch her. The feminist tells her that she is being &#8220;abused&#8221; and that she should get a restraining order and take her kids away so that they do not see &#8220;abuse&#8221; if she doesnt do this then she is some sort of &#8220;enabler&#8221; and the &#8220;abuse&#8221; will &#8220;escalate&#8221;. Scared, the wife pulls the kids out of school and moves them out of the house into a women&rsquo;s shelter until she can get her own place and files for a restraining order. The poor husband comes home to an empty house and is forbidden from trying to talk to his wife or kids. He has to go to &#8220;domestic violence counseling&#8221; where he is told that he has to become the feminist ideal man or he will lose his family forever. The real victims of domestic violence will rarely escape after the first incident of abuse, she will rationalize that somehow she deserved to have her eyes blackened, teeth knocked out or face slapped and stay around after he apologizes. These refugee women will never get help since they are used to this and will continue to take it. This is one reason that Muslims and other third world people do not need to be here. </p>

		<p>Not all moslems are wife beaters, though some are.  </p>
<p>The REAL problem that is never addressed is latino culture.  Moslem immigration is small potatoes compared to the 30-40 million latinos here, and there are HUGE cultural differences.</p>
<p>Latino machismo culture is very abusive to women.  (Recently women from Guatemala petitioned for the right to immigrate to the U.S. because domestic violence is so common there.)</p>
<p>I know a lot of latinos too.  The young men slap their girls around IN PUBLIC and think nothing of it.  (I&rsquo;ve seen it on several occassions.  No one says anything, not even the girl.)</p>
<p>Asians are well known for getting drunk and beating their wives - heck, they chop up their wives with cleavers.  (There have been several high profile cases around like that here where I live.)</p>
<p>Readers here usually save their most vitriolic responses for the moslems, but the things we dislike are common to most third worlders, regardless of religion.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;The REAL problem that is never addressed is latino culture. Moslem immigration is small potatoes compared to the 30-40 million latinos here, and there are HUGE cultural differences.<br>
Latino machismo culture is very abusive to women.  The young men slap their girls around IN PUBLIC and think nothing of it.&#8221;</i><br>

<p>There is a great deal  of affinity between so-called &#8220;Latino&#8221; culture and Arabic/Moslem culture.  Spain inherited A LOT of social attitudes from the Arabs/Moors, and those attitudes still linger on strongly in Hispanic culture, despite the formal re-imposition of Christianity (which was really just a veneer over an Islamic base).</p>

		<p>Not all moslems are wife beaters, though some are.<br>
The REAL problem that is never addressed is latino culture. </p>
<p>This is ignorant and not in line with reality.  Because in point of fact, ALL muslims are wife beaters.  The religion demands it.  Since the religion is totalitarian and threatens death, torture and worse for disobedience, muslim men do as they are told&hellip;.period.  And what they are told is to beat their wives.  They are not allowed a choice in the matter&hellip;..something that has not been talked about much.</p>
<p>Latinos&hellip;..do not exist.  Terms like hispanic, latino, etc. are racist words liberals came up with to divide and conquer.  There is no solidarity among these spanish speaking groups and certainly no shared cultural identity.  I will go so far as to say that a state of open warfare and ethnic cleansing exists in many of these countries.  Spanish speaking peoples are white, black or indian.  Spanish speaking people from different countries that are white, are similar, and identify themselves as white, right along with other whites in the US and Canada.  Just like french canadians are, for the most part, white, but speak a different language, so do white south of the border.</p>
<p>Spanish speaking blacks act much as you would expect any other blacks to.  The specific &#8220;latinos&#8221; you are alluding to here are indians&hellip;.mestizos.  America&rsquo;s &#8220;hispanic&#8221; immigration problem consists of nearly 100% mestizos, by the way.  Liberals want Americans to identify this specific genetic group as &#8220;hispanic&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s part of a divide and conquer strategy.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fall for it.</p>

		<p>I can for see a future where the courts will say it&rsquo;s okay for these people to beat their wive&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s part of their culture.<br>
Thinks it&rsquo;s impossible? Just wait.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In the immigrants&rsquo; native countries, these incidents would be considered common social and cultural practices. But in their new home, they are classified as abuse and felony assault.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A refugee from Somalia was accused of trying to sell her 16-year-old daughter into marriage against her will.</p>
<p>Social Services took another Somali couple&rsquo;s six children because the father belt-whipped his 8-year-old son and tied him up for misbehaving in school.</p>
<p>A Yemeni husband beat his wife and threw her down the stairs for talking back to him in front of the family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Come on guys, hasn&rsquo;t anyone ever taught you that all cultures are equal? Who are we RACIST WHITE PEOPLE to judge these foreigners with our overly WESTERN, EUROPEAN VALUES? </p>

		<p>I was assured by a woman Mexican friend that wife beating is very widespread in Mexico. It had certainly occurred in the two Mexican families I got to know well.</p>
<p>Some of you may recall that early Mexican TV show with Groucho Marcos, &#8220;You Beat Your Wife&#8221; :)</p>
