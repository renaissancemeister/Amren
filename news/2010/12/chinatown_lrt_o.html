<h1>Chinatown LRT Opponents Say Proposed Route is Bad Feng Shui</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jana G. Pruden, Edmonton Journal, Dec. 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some members of Edmonton&rsquo;s Chinese community oppose the proposed LRT route through Chinatown, saying it threatens the community&rsquo;s cultural importance and is bad Feng Shui. </p>
<p>&#8220;It creates a sense of barrier, stopping energy from going to Chinatown,&#8221; said Stephen Chan, a Feng Shui practitioner. </p>
<p>Feng Shui is the ancient Chinese practice of achieving harmony and balance through environmental and esthetic design. </p>
<p>Chan said the proposed route, which sees the LRT running along 102nd Avenue through the China Gate, will put Edmonton&rsquo;s &#8220;Dragon Vein&#8221; into turmoil, and could throw the entire city&rsquo;s positive energy into a negative cycle. Chan said he knows some people do not believe in Feng Shui, but he asks people to be open-minded about the wisdom contained in the ancient practice. </p>
<p>He said the current plan is &#8220;really bad&#8221; Feng Shui. </p>
<p>Chan will be among several delegations from the Chinese community appearing Wednesday in city council chambers to present their concerns to the transportation and public works committee. Chan said the Chinese community has been &#8220;shaken&#8221; by the proposed downtown LRT connector route. Some fear it could threaten the Chinatown area. </p>
<p>In addition to having trains running above ground at the China Gate, the route has a tunnel entrance in front of the Chinese Multicultural Centre. </p>
<p>Chinese Benevolent Association spokesman Allan Kwan said he is worried about what the LRT would mean for those people living and working in the area. </p>
<p>He said he is also afraid of the repercussions of losing parts of 102nd Avenue in Chinatown, an important gathering place on occasions such as Chinese New Year and Canada Day, and both culturally and historically significant. </p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what is the future viability of Chinatown with this proposed expansion.&#8221; </p>
<p>Stephen Tsang, who joined a task force objecting to the LRT plan, says there are ways to make the LRT work in the Chinatown area, but the current plan doesn&rsquo;t fit. &#8220;I am for the LRT, I just don&rsquo;t think the route is right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.&#8221; </p>
<p>Tsang said the proposed route would make it harder for seniors living in the area, and would seriously restrict vehicle and pedestrian traffic. He hopes council will consider moving the tunnel entrance away from the Chinese Multicultural Centre, or choose a different route. </p>
<p>Like Tsang, Kwan said he hopes council will give serious consideration to the community&rsquo;s concerns. </p>
<p>&#8220;We want the city to slow down, to allow some time to work out some of these issues.&#8221; </p>
<p>Adam Laughlin, director of facility and capital planning, declined Tuesday to be interviewed about the issue because he was too busy preparing for Wednesday&rsquo;s meeting. <br>

		<p>I was once in a building in Toronto that contained condos used by many persons of Chinese descent. I am accustomed to not seeing a 13th floor in buildings (which I do not like, as I was born on the 13th), but in this building&rsquo;s elevator, there was no 13th floor button, 14th floor button, or 4th floor button. The number 4 was &#8216;bad feng shui&rsquo;, I was told, hence had been removed. And that was ridiculous. I told the person I was with that if someone lived on the 15th floor, he/she was really on the 12th floor.</p>

I`d have to say although I don`t know the mechanics or laws of Feng Shui, I believe in it. Or something like it.  Call it &#8220;flow&#8221; or &#8220;ergonomic design&#8221; or whatever fits. But I`ve walked up to, around and run past enough Downtown underpasses to know a &#8220;bad feeling&#8221; when my gut tells me.</p>

		<p>There are over a million Chinese in Canada, thanks to 30 years of greed-driven immigration policies which allowed them in.</p>
<p>They are mostly from the mainland (not Taiwan), and are fiercely nationalistic. The Chinese have added Canada to their collection of trophy colonies, which include Malaysia and Singapore (a more complete listing of &#8216;Overseas Chinese&rsquo; may be found on Wiki). </p>
<p>The Chinese government refers to the estimated 40 million strong diaspora as &#8216;Overseas Chinese&rsquo;, meaning they expect to always regard them as their loyal nationals.</p>

		<p>Straight lines funnel &#8220;sha&#8221; or kill energy. Detrimental to your health. So believe the Chinese. </p>
<p>Feng Shui [feng schway] was actually an impediment to the modernization of China. Railroads to the Chinese, with straight line are a &#8220;kill&#8221; force. The &#8220;strange&#8221; or &#8220;odd&#8221; appearance westerners perceive in Chinese architecture actually has a sound basis in an ancient belief system. </p>

		<p>While the gardens I have visited which have been arranged according to feng shui were quite beautiful, it is needless to say that I don&rsquo;t believe that it has the power to affect one&rsquo;s fortune. If Feng Shui is the best resason against the tunnel, then it should go ahead.</p>
<p>To Poster 1- Matt<br>
Then the Chinese in Canada must be more superstitious than the ones in China! All buildings bar two I visited while I was there had all floors numbered correctly; the number omitted in those cases was of course; Four.</p>
<p>To Poster 3- Anonymous<br>
Canada is not a Chinese colony, and neither is Malaysia. To suggest so would be rather irrational. The Chinese are in no position to influence things their way in Canada, and in Malaysia, their economic sway is mitigated by the quotas that work against their favour in everyday life. Not all Chinese are nationalistic either. The majority of the 3.6 million Singaporeans (or around 8% of Overseas Chinese) came to Singapore in the dying years of the Chinese Empire. To say that they secretly pledge allegiance to a nominally Communist run State borders on ridiculous. Recent immigrants however, are increasingly nationalistic, so I agree in part with your point; but their children as far as I can tell are not.</p>

		<p>The solution here is very simple. Tell the Chinese that Canada doesn&rsquo;t follow the superstitions of third-world minorities. If we did everything that the Chinese thought we ought to do (or for that matter East Indians, Africans, etc..) we&rsquo;d soon come to resemble their countries, you know, the one&rsquo;s they left!</p>
<p>The Chinese and above mentioned minorities are never, ever Canadian. The only people who pander to them are the usual multi-culti lovers, aka the media and politicians. Almost everyone else in Canada simply looks upon them as exotic ethnics to be avoided where possible. Go to any mall, public meeting place or venue, and watch the ethnic make-up. Mixed racial groups are the vast exception, rather than the rule, even after 22 years of forced government multiculturalism.</p>
<p>We are Canadians, and we know who we are, and we know who isn&rsquo;t. The Chinese, born here or not, are not Canadians. So take your hyphen and you know what you can do with it.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas</p>

		<p>#7 - End to Illusion - RE your first point, in Mainland China they do not take it as seriously as far as I&rsquo;m aware (or the government may discourage it) but in Taiwan and Hong Kong they are VERY superstitious. In Taiwan I have very often seen the fourth floor left off the floor buttons in an elevator, and the extent to which HK residents take Feng Shui seriously is well-known. A friend of mine works in a building where on her floor, one office room is left empty because it is considered to have bad Feng Shui (two or three employees who worked in it lost their jobs which just added to the superstition). Mainlanders one encounters overseas are a little less superstitious in my experience. They still share some of the same superstitions but not to such a degree - perhaps one of the few good things Mao managed to achieve by stamping it out just a little bit (one of the goals of the Cultural Revolution, I believe). As is it&rsquo;s just unnecessary, outdated cultural baggage, in my opinion.</p>

 <b>&#8220;Chan said he knows some people do not believe in Feng Shui, but he asks people to be open-minded about the wisdom contained in the ancient practice. &#8220;</b></p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t believe in this superstition either! I&rsquo;m one of those people.    I wonder what the Chinese government thinks?   Probably they&rsquo;re no more sympathetic than I am.  Maybe even less so.  China is presently making great strides,  and they cannot accommodate these outdated, medieval notions and make progress too.</p>
<p>I just saw on the BBC a few nights ago  an impressive  a program about new high speed trains in China.  (They already have the fastest train in the world, and are building an even  faster one!)    In just the next two years, they are planning to build another FOURTEEN new high-speed lines!   (We don&rsquo;t have a single one.)  And by 2020,  they will have more high-speed mileage than  <i> all the rest of the world combined! </i></p>
<p>These figures are absolutely stunning!   And I cannot believe the Chinese government (in China)  would allow such superstitions to get in the way of progress. Only in the West, do we, in the folly of supporting multi-culturalism, pay heed to every tiny, silly complaint for fear of offending someonem  or their &#8220;culture&#8221;.   The Chinese government would have no truck with it! <br>

<p>You cannot have trains going 300 or 400 mph, without straight lines.  Sorry, Feng Shui cultists!   It just wouldn&rsquo;t work. Leave your  superrstitions behind and come into the 21st century!</p>

<p>if feng shui were able to affect one&rsquo;s fortune, then how come the West (and Japan) have done so well, without it?   That should settle the question right there.</p>
