			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Melanie Eversley, The Grio, Dec. 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African-American residents of central Alabama are organizing to protest the six-month jail sentence that a white former state trooper has just begun for one of the seminal killings of the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
<p>A candlelight vigil open to people from across the country and other possible events are in the works, residents said this week.</p>
<p>The motivation for all this organizing is the fact that James Bonard Fowler, 77, began serving a half-year sentence on Dec. 1 in Geneva, Ala., for the Feb. 18, 1965, fatal shooting of Jimmie Lee Jackson, a 26-year-old African-American church deacon, father and Vietnam veteran. </p>
<p>Jackson was taking part in a peaceful civil rights protest in his hometown of Marion, Ala., when Fowler shot him in the stomach. Jackson died eight days later in the hospital, his death prompting the Selma to Montgomery marches, which ultimately led to passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p>
<p>In November, decades after Jackson&rsquo;s death, Fowler was indicted and allowed to plead guilty to a lesser misdemeanor charge of second-degree manslaughter.</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo; daughter, Cordelia Billingsley, said she is not happy with the outcome. </p>
<p>&#8220;Justice hasn&rsquo;t been served,&#8221; she said in a telephone interview from her home in Marion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Residents have picked the Feb. 26 the anniversary of Jackson&rsquo;s death to march to the jail in Geneva, Ala., where Fowler is being held, and hold a candlelight vigil, Brown said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, we&rsquo;re extremely concerned because Jimmie Lee Jackson&rsquo;s death was so impactful,&#8221; Toure said. &#8220;It led to &#8216;Bloody Sunday,&rsquo; which led to the Voting Rights Act that ultimately led to the election of the first African-American president this century.&#8221;</p>
<p>On that night in February 1965, Jimmie Lee Jackson had joined 400 others to protest the jailing of a local activist. The night turned violent, as authorities used nightsticks and cattle prods on the crowd. Lee&rsquo;s grandfather, Cager Lee, 82, was beaten and hospitalized with open scalp wounds and bruises.</p>
<p>Jackson and his mother retreated to the inside of a café with other protesters. Troopers followed and two of them began beating Jackson&rsquo;s mother. When Jackson moved to block the troopers, he was shot in the stomach. Jackson ran out of the café and made it a half block when the troopers caught up with him and beat him. Eight days later, he died at a hospital in Selma.</p>
<p>At his funeral, Martin Luther King talked of visiting him. &#8220;I never will forget as I stood by his bedside a few days ago &hellip; how radiantly he still responded, how he mentioned the freedom movement and how he talked about the faith that he still had in his God,&#8221; King would say during the eulogy at a packed Zion United Methodist Church in Marion. &#8220;Like every self-respecting negro, Jimmie Jackson wanted to be free.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yeah, just like all striking workers were angels, who wish no harm on their companies in their absence as workers on strike hoping to bring the factory to the bargaining table giving in to their demands - innocent angels with hungry children to feed - and those darn brute Pinkerton guards would go off company property searching for innocent striking workers to beat up and victimize&hellip; </p>
<p>The world is truly backwards and it seems there is nothing that can turn it right.  </p>

<p>Say, would these be the same &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; who are always telling us that we need to put the past behind us and Let The Healing Begin?</p>
<p>I guess black hagiography means never having to stop saying you&rsquo;re sorry.<br>

Before I take sides on this, I would like to know who started the violence. At the time I would have blamed the whites. After four more years of black ghetto riots, I would have wanted to learn details of the event. <br>
 <br>
45 years and several violent black felonies later I no longer see blacks as unoffensive victims of irrational color prejudice. </p>

		<p>Would the aftermath of this have been MLK&rsquo;s decision it was a better idea to have peaceful protests, than mob protests?  And of course, MLK&rsquo;s protest marches were ALWAYS peaceful, right?  Must be so, because the government schools teach that it is so.<br>

<p>AND Vietnam veteran?? Earlier than Feb 65&rsquo;? To my knowledge, the only U.S. military personnel in Vietnam at that time (64&rsquo; and earlier) were Marine, Army Special Forces and CIA advisors and ALSO to my knowledge, there were no blacks in those units and VERY FEW were to be seen even after that in those same units. Of course, as usual, I could be wrong but that was/is my personal observation OF those units.</p>

		<p>My father was caught up in one of those &#8220;peaceful protests&#8221; in Memphis. It ended up with the national guard enforcing a curfew. But back to my father. He pulled up to a red light and got caught between two vehicles. That&rsquo;s when several blacks tried to pull him out Reginald Denny style. He managed to fire off a couple of shots and they scattered. I certainly don&rsquo;t see incidents like that every day. But I&rsquo;ve seen enough over the years to be skeptical.</p>

		<p>Saw a great bumper sticker the other day: &#8216;I Don&rsquo;t Believe The Controlled Media.&rsquo; Gave the driver a thumbs-up.</p>
<p>A few months ago, the neighborhood branch of the controlled media said that a local Tea Party protest was violent and that the protesters were screaming the N-word. I knew the article was all lies as soon as I read the first sentence - because I had been at the protest myself, and I knew that there had been no violence or throwing around of racial slurs of any kind.</p>
<p>Now, when I read this controlled media article that claims that saintly, angelic, can-do-no-wrong, peaceful black protesters were violently attacked by DA EEEEEVVVILLLL RAYCISS WHITE MAN&hellip;is it any wonder that I DON&rsquo;T BELIEVE THEM?!</p>

		<p>If this man did indeed maliciously murder someone (and the evidence certainly looks like he did), then he should be incarcerated. Period.</p>
<p>His age and race should be irrelevant.<br>

		<p>I live in Alabama &amp; I have read many stories about this in the local media. The march was anything but peaceful &amp; the police &amp; troopers were attacked with bricks &amp; bottles by an angry mob. Trooper Fowler has always maintained that Jackson was shot when he tried to take away his gun &amp; the shooting was unintentional. I noticed this important detail was somehow left off the original story. He took the six month plea deal because he knew his fate could be much worse with a black DA &amp; mostly black jury.    </p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but note the same strange inconsistency.  Prior to the big buildup which began with the deployment of the 173rd Airborne Brigade in May &#8216;65 and the Marines shortly thereafter the only Americans in SVN were MACV advisors and SF types.  It appears highly unlikely that this guy would had been in Vietnam in the advisory period, though, depending on his MOS, I suppose it&rsquo;s possible.  What&rsquo;s even less likely for the time was for military types, blacks or whites, to have either sympathy or involvement with the civil rights movement. </p>

		<p>These Bantus are outraged because a white man was given six months for killing a Bantu. They&rsquo;re foaming at the mouth because it was a white-on-black situation.</p>
<p>Yet, if a Bantu kills another Bantu, they&rsquo;re silent. Or else, they&rsquo;ll blame the gun. Or they&rsquo;ll blame the criminal justice system for sentencing a Bantu to jail.</p>
