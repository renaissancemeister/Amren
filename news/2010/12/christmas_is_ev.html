			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), Dec. 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fanatics from a banned Islamic hate group have launched a nationwide poster campaign denouncing Christmas as evil.</p>
<p>Organisers plan to put up thousands of placards around the UK claiming the season of goodwill is responsible for rape, teenage pregnancies, abortion, promiscuity, crime and paedophilia.</p>
<p>They hope the campaign will help &#8216;destroy Christmas&rsquo; in this country and lead to Britons converting to Islam instead.</p>
<p>Labour MP and anti racist campaigner Jim Fitzpatrick branded the posters &#8216;extremely offensive&rsquo; and demanded they were immediately ripped down.</p>
<p>The placards, which have already appeared in parts of London, feature an apparently festive scene with an image of the Star of Bethlehem over a Christmas tree.</p>
<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Image.jpg" src="/news/2010/12/24/Image.jpg" width="468" height="594" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></span></p>
<p>But under a banner announcing &#8216;the evils of Christmas&rsquo; it features a message mocking the song the 12 Days of Christmas.</p>
<p>It reads: &#8216;On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me an STD (sexually transmitted disease).</p>
<p>&#8216;On the second day debt, on the third rape, the fourth teenage pregnancies and then there was abortion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>According to the posters, Christmas is also to responsible for paganism, domestic violence, homelessness, vandalism, alcohol and drugs.</p>
<p>Another offence of Christmas, it proclaims, is &#8216;claiming God has a son&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The bottom of the poster declares: &#8216;In Islam we are protected from all of these evils. We have marriage, family, honour, dignity, security, rights for man, woman and child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The campaign&rsquo;s organiser is 27-year-old Abu Rumaysah, who once called for Sharia Law in Britain at a press conference held by hate preacher leader Anjem Choudary, the leader of militant group Islam4UK.</p>
<p>Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson banned Islam4UK group earlier this year, making it a criminal offence to be a member, after it threatened to protest at Wootton Bassett, the town where Britain honours its war dead.</p>
<p>Mr Rumaysah told the Mail that he was unconcerned about offending Christians.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;Christmas is a lie and as Muslims it is our duty to attack it.</p>
<p>&#8216;But our main attack is on the fruits of Christmas, things like alcohol abuse and promiscuity that increase during Christmas and all the other evils these lead to such as abortion, domestic violence and crime.</p>
<p>&#8216;We hope that out campaign will make people realise that Islam is the only way to avoid this and convert.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Rumaysah, who said his campaign was not linked to any group, boasted that the posters would be put up in cities around the country, including London, Birmingham and Cardiff.</p>
<p>The campaign was highlighted by volunteers from a charity which distributes food and presents to pensioners and the lonely at Christmas.</p>
<p>Sister Christine Frost, founder of the East London Neighbours in Poplar charity, said: &#8216;The more posters I saw, the more angry I got.</p>
<p>&#8216;Someone is stirring hatred which leaves the road open to revenge attacks or petrol bombs through letter-boxes.</p>
<p>&#8216;I told the Mayor we are all scared.</p>
<p>&#8216;If we said such things about Muslims, we&rsquo;d all be hanging from lamp-posts.</p>
<p>&#8216;The posters appear to be professionally printed&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Poplar and Limehouse MP Mr Fitzpatrick said: &#8216;These posters are extremely offensive and have upset a lot of people - that&rsquo;s why we jumped on it and asked the council to remove them.</p>
<p>&#8216;Sister Christine is rooted in the community and doesn&rsquo;t take offence lightly.</p>
<p>&#8216;But these hate posters really upset her. Christmas is close to her belief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Met Police spokesman said they had received complaints and were investigating.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;We are investigating allegations of religious hate crime in Tower Hamlets following complaints about posters displayed in and around the Mile End area.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman said the posters had &#8216;upset and antagonised many residents&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;The messages on these posters are offensive and do not reflect the views of the Council or the vast majority of residents.&rsquo;<br>

<p>So the <i>Daily Mail</i> went to an &#8220;anti racist Labour MP&#8221; to get an official quote, did they?  How about the BNP?  Didn&rsquo;t anyone at the <i>Daily Mail</i> think to ask them what <i>they thought?</i></p>
<p>I suspect that the <i>Mail</i> was deathly afraid the BNP would have a <i>lot</i> to say.  Something along the lines of &#8220;I told you so.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Between atheists and Muslims attacking Christmas- no other holiday gets this sort of hatred. Many people who are totally secular will celebrate Christmas and the worlds most expensive Christmas tree is in the Islamic country of Dubai. This seems like another case of tyranny of the minority- one parent in a class will complain about Christmas carols and the Christmas program is cancelled. One employee in a company of several hundred will say something about a Christmas tree and all decorations are gone. Whatever happened to &#8220;majority rule&#8221;? My guess is that if the holiday is considered &#8220;White&#8221; or &#8220;European&#8221; then it is fair game for abuse. My guess is that if a White parent complained about a Kwanzaa or Ramadan program they would be considered racist haters. </p>

		<p>Those nutty Muslisms should thank Allah that they live in a civilized Western country that allows them to say stupid stuff like this. If you spoke a critical word in an Islamic country, they&rsquo;s pull your tongue out of your head or stone you to death&hellip;</p>

They might get a few disaffected people who dislike Christmas for any number of reasons but I don&rsquo;t see them winning over the majority.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Another offense of Christmas, it proclaims, is &lsquo;claiming God has a son&rsquo;.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read from other Muslims is that they accept that Jesus was the Son of God (a prophet, not a Messiahs) but they consider Him less than Adam because Adam was a wholly created by God whereas Jesus is half man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s remarkable that these people can continually and openly attack the west and yet their motives and goals are rarely challenged or acknowledged as the threat they are. I suppose it fits into the modern paradigm that the reason they hate us is because we don&rsquo;t give them enough love and understanding; we are guilty of being unChristian.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;A Met Police spokesman said they had received complaints and were investigating.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Minorities have the right of free speech. We do not. The investigation will amount to talking to muslim leaders and accepting the excuse that these people are fanatics on the fringe and of no real concern. However, just to be safe, Christmas will be banned so as not to offend anyone or foment hostilities.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t you just love how these muslims attack Christmas for EVERYTHING they and their own Prophet do/did?  Amazing.  Will THIS now be enough to convince Europeans and European Americans that Islam does NOT belong in any western nation?  That they are NOT a &#8220;religion of peace&#8221;?  That their goal IS to Islamisize every nation they are allowed in to, or conduct violent jihad within that country, or both?  Time to deport them all from every Western nation, allow none of them to attend our schools and universities, and grant no visas to them for ANY purpose.  And most especially, round up and deport all the BLACK muslims in every country.  And please don&rsquo;t tell me muslims abhor alcohol.  YOU never saw them in droves coming in to Bahrain from Saudi sitting in the bars getting plastered.  I have.</p>

		<p>On our side of the ledger, we have STDs, debt, rape, teenage pregnancies, raves, claiming God has a son, blasphemy, exploitation, promiscuity, night clubs, crime, pedophilia, paganism, domestic violence, homelessness, violence, vandalism, alcohol and drugs.</p>
<p>On their side of the ledger?  9/11.</p>
<p>We win.</p>
<p>BTW, the part that makes me most angry is that it&rsquo;s (supposedly) mostly Labour Party officials and &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; activists getting mad.  They&rsquo;re a big part of the reason why all these two-faced taqquiya-spouting Muslims are in England to begin with.  It&rsquo;s SITYS time for the BNP.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know.  I kind of like it. When did Christianity become too good to criticize?  I was watching A Christmas Carol the other night, and it was shocking how much the social darwinists of yesteryear resemble the &#8220;Christians&#8221; of today.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s something deeply unnatural about people who are guests in a foreign land behaving so belligerently, rudely, and disrespectfully towards their hosts. Never mind having a bit of gratitude. </p>
<p>What makes modern liberalism so nauseating is the way that creating a sense of entitlement has encouraged these bizarre and inhuman ways of behaving. To treat the owner of a home or the collective owners of a country the way that Muslim &#8220;migrants&#8221; in Europe treat their host countries would be hard to imagine under most circumstances. How do liberals justify making excuses for these people to behave in ways that even they would never allow their own children to behave?</p>

		<p>As I write this, Christmas has just been celebrated here in Australia, both by (most of) the Nation and individual families including my own.</p>
<p>I think the true spirit of Christmas has been observed at every level of society, from political &amp; Church leaders saying encouraging words, right down to our little grandchildren saying &#8220;happy Christmas&#8221; to us.</p>
<p>We have even had the State Governor of South Australia pleading for an end to the PC madness which is trying to curtail Christmas celebrations!</p>
<p>What has not been obvious are all the evils described on that obnoxious UK Islamic Anti-Christmas poster.</p>
<p>We must STOP letting the Islamic Invaders tell us how to run our countries here in the West.</p>
<p>I will finish by saying a Very Happy Christmas to other Amren supporters while I am still allowed to say it!</p>

		<p>Of course, there is one very simple answer:<br>
These muslims are all free to emigrate (and take their considerable skills, talents and wealth with them), leave christian England behind them and go to live amongst the umma and be be uncontaminated by the kuffar and their &#8216;vile&rsquo; practices.<br>
 And also the climate in England is well and truly horrible, what with all this freezing weather.<br>
 If Pakistan or Bangladesh are too impoverished for their liking the surely their muslim brothers in Dubai and Saudi Arabia (flush with cash with oil at $90+ a barrel), would be pleased with the economic boost all these trained and qualified personnel can give them.<br>
 Such a great bargain on both sides, a win-win situation! - Just why hasn&rsquo;t the scenario materialised?<br>
  - But I forget, in Saudi the Pakistani is usually that &#8216;funny little man&rsquo; who parks the car and opens the gate.</p>

		<p>Anon11, the point is not that Christianity is &#8220;too good&#8221; to criticize, but that Whites (the British) have to put up with criticism that basically amounts to threats in their own land. Non whites do not allow this sort of foolery in their own countries, because they don&rsquo;t have the disease of &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Also, the false bravado on the part of the Labour spokesman is too little, too late. It&rsquo;s people like them who have put Whites in this situation in the first place.</p>

		<p>have we already given up?<br>
Surrendered?<br>
Bowed down to our new master?</p>
<p>We built America on Christian values, whatever that really means.<br>
We have no problem with any other religion being practiced here.<br>
They may practice a different religion or accept one of ours, it is their free choice to make.<br>
But Now it seems as if The Radicals tell us and everyone else what they will and won&rsquo;t do?<br>
It seems as if Americans have sunk into a pit of fear?<br>
The insult our beliefs BUT we must accommodate Any and All of theirs or they threaten to KILL us, apparently that is okay UNLESS you practice a religion that is not their choice?<br>
If an American touches a Qu&rsquo;ran in a way they don&rsquo;t like they threaten our lives and our families. We seem to accept that as we sit in front of the TV watching Dancing With The Stars?<br>
They spit on our Holy Books and we do Nothing.<br>
And so the World Goes On..<br>
What is America&rsquo;s future? Have we turned into Little Girlie Men who bow down to &#8220;Obama Bin Lyin&#8221; with little or no complaint. I want anyone out there to try to get any government job and not provide proper identification (including A Real birth certificate. I can tell you this your interview will end quite rapidly.

		<p>To poster 11,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about criticizing Christianity. It&rsquo;s that Muslims in England can feel free to bash Christianity, but if a christian made a similar poster about Ramadan or Muhummad, there would be much weeping and gnashing of teeth. I think insulting Islam in England is a felony.</p>

		<p>&#8220;When did Christianity become too good to criticize&#8221;? Never - I&rsquo;m an agnostic and I criticize it myself on occasion, most often because the whole &#8220;God made us all the same&#8221; line 90% of them like to repeat leads very easily to an anti-white path. But the point people are trying to make is that Islam is so screwed up that it has no standing to criticize anyone, except other Muslims.</p>
<p>And of course, despite our differences, I&rsquo;d much rather live next to Christians than Muslims. Christians don&rsquo;t cut off heads, stone women, or riot over cartoons.</p>

		<p>The cruel irony is that the statements made about Islam as far as respect for women and such are western phenomenon. That is the openess, freedom and respect that women enjoy comes from Western ideals not Islamic principals. </p>
<p>What they have done is a sort of pseudo judo that is they have taken Chrisitanity and made it appear as if it is the enemy. When really the enemy is liberalisim and the rejection of Christian values. What is on trial here is the tolerance for anything not only in the Christian world but also in the festering pimple of Islam threatening to burst forth and spread it&rsquo;s infection among weak British Christians. </p>

adhere to Sharia&hellip;ARE NOT &#8220;RADICALS&#8221;..they are simply<br>
doing what Islam commands. Any muslim that really<br>
does what the Koran commands..will be &#8220;radical&#8221;.<br>
Got it? This is why our &#8220;tolerance&#8221; is literally killing us.<br>
We need to get &#8220;intolerant&#8221; and fast.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not all that big on Christianity.  I see it as Marx and others did: an opiating means to chain society to the concept of horrific sacrifice and struggle in this life for the promise of an unknown paradise beyond.</p>
<p>All at the word and deed of a suicide whom, if he ever lived when they say he did, is not evolutionarily (no Adam, no 6,000 year human existence) responsible for alleviating our &#8216;original sin&rsquo;.  Something that no omnipotent god would have ever &#8216;designed into&rsquo; something by mistake to begin with.</p>
<p>That said, let&rsquo;s look at the reality of Islam:</p>
<p>Shiia in Bahrain worry about ethnic marginalization and replacement and comments on torture by the Bahrainian leadership against it&rsquo;s own kind.</p>
<p>This is &#8216;the law which protects Muslims&rsquo; in the Middle East.</p>

<p>While this is a sorry place and time to mention this in light of the just passed Holiday it is intended to celebrate (yes, even an atheist can appreciate the kindness and warmth of the season), the fact of the matter is that ALL of the Middle East and much of Asia only yells about our bad habits because they know we are ignorant about their&rsquo;s which are not so firmly closeted as we assume.</p>
<p>In this, I find it suspicious that the rising consciousness of a defense of Christianity, not as a moral system but as a commercialized, consumerist, excuse to &#8216;celebrate&rsquo;; is being encouraged by acknowledging it&rsquo;s many detractors.</p>
<p>Too many times, Christian beliefs have led to the very kinds of zealous do-gooderism that precedes or derives from White Guilt.  And the resultant outpouring of libations to ameliorate that guilt amounts to passive self-victimization by an entire race in a world where no others are so afflicted.</p>
<p>If you need it as a crutch, it is still better if religion is not institutionalized because, historically, there have been waaaaay too many strange bedfellows instances of corruption for convenience, by both parties of the church insistent upon giving to Caesar that which is yours.  And the secular rule, which recognizes morality only as it is preached by one franchise ownership of spirituality.</p>

		<p>Ayaan Hirsi Ali, of Somalian origin, arrived in the Netherlands in 1992.  She would eventually become a member of Parliament.  Ali has much to teach the West about the nature of Islam.  From a review of Hirsi Ali&rsquo;s INFIDEL, MY LIFE by Steven Farron in American Renaissance:  </p>
<p>Then came the September 11 attack on the Twin Towers. Her immediate reaction was to think, &ldquo;Oh Allah, please let it not be Muslims who did this.&rdquo; That night, Dutch television showed Muslim children in the Netherlands rejoicing at the attack. Miss Ali was working at a think-tank of the Labor Party, which had a plurality in the Dutch parliament. The next morning, &ldquo;I found myself walking to the office with Ruud Koole, the chairman of the Labor Party. &hellip; He said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s so weird, isn&rsquo;t it, all these people saying that this has to do with Islam?&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help myself. &hellip; I blurted out, &lsquo;But it is about Islam [her italics] . &hellip; This is Islam.&rsquo; Ruud said &hellip; &lsquo;[T]hese people &hellip; are a lunatic fringe. We have extremist Christians, too . &hellip; Most Muslims do not believe these things. To say so is to disparage a faith &hellip; which is civilized and peaceful.&rsquo; I walked into my office thinking, &lsquo;I have to wake these people up.&rsquo;&hellip; It was not a lunatic fringe who felt this way about America and the West. I knew that the vast majority of Muslims would see the attacks as justified . &hellip; This was not just Islam, this was the core of Islam&rdquo; (pp. 268-9).</p>

The cruel irony is that the statements made about Islam as far as respect for women and such are western [phenomena]. That is the openess, freedom and respect that women enjoy comes from Western ideals not Islamic principals. </p>
<p>What they have done is a sort of pseudo-judo that is they have taken Chrisitanity and made it appear as if it is the enemy. When really the enemy is liberalisim and the rejection of Christian values.<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, but as you say, &#8220;the freedom and respect that women enjoy [in the western world] come from Western ideals&#8221;. But giving credit where it&rsquo;s due,  those ideals come not from EITHER Christianity or Islam. These are ancient European social traditions, long pre-dating Christianity. The freedom and equality of women (although never absolute) was already much greater than elsewhere in the world (perhaps excepting some American Indian tribes). Christianity, in fact, somewhat subdued women down to a Mediterranean or Semitic standard (though never so extreme as Islam).  </p>
<p>Even the Roman historians observed and wrote about the remarkable freedom that women enjoyed  among the ancient Britons and Germans. It was not Christianity which gave them this freedom and status. It was already European   &mdash;   especially Celtic and Germanic   &mdash;    tradition.</p>
<p>Ascribing this unique feature to Christianity is crediting it to the wrong source. At any rate, hardly any other women in the world enjoy such a degree of freedom today as women in the west. That some of them would be willing to give up this unique historical advantage, and voluntarily (!), in the name of tolerance for the &#8220;Other&#8221; is appalling. </p>
