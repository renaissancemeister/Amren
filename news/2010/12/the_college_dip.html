			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Weissberg, American Thinker, December 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For more than a half-century, government has tried to close racial gaps in educational attainment. Sad to say, those gaps have proven intractable. Nevertheless, the impulse remains as heartfelt as ever (perhaps due to its financially lucrative character), but the emphasis is now shifting from actual learning to equality of graduation rates. President Obama has spoken of adding 5 million graduates to the workforce by 2020, and credential-mania is now all the rage. This shift is a disaster in the making; imparting knowledge is commendable, but just handing out diplomas is harmful deception. A cynic might aver that the shift from knowledge to graduation rates is a tacit admission that the gap-closing quest is futile.</p>
<p>Consider a recent Washington Post story, &#8220;Md&rsquo;s Towson University conquers &#8216;graduation gap.&rsquo;&#8221; The story explains how Towson is now among the tiny few that have equalized graduation across blacks, whites, and Hispanics. The article&rsquo;s tone was clearly celebratory. Meanwhile, a report prepared by The Education Trust (cited in the Post story) that examines the topic more broadly insisted that equal graduation rates &#8220;would be a very big step in putting our country on a path to a better and more equitable future.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tip-off to this educational chicanery is the silence regarding actual learning, as if the physical piece of paper signified educational competency. There is nothing about what these graduates majored in, their class rank and future academic success in graduate schools, professional certification exams scores, or future employment. Having the piece of paper is, apparently, the great accomplishment.</p>
<p>{snip} So let me offer what might be called &#8220;A Guide to Schools Desperate to Increase Minority Graduation Rates.&#8221;</p>
<p>First, offer special, unadvertised &#8220;minority only&#8221; courses. Thanks to today&rsquo;s charitable standard grading curve, nearly all enrollees will now receive As and Bs to eradicate Ds and Fs elsewhere. {snip} At the University of Illinois-Urbana, where I taught for 28 years, such &#8220;minority only&#8221; courses paralleled multiple introductory courses in varied fields and superficially appeared to be bona fide courses. {snip} In a pinch, universities are free to award full academic credit to de facto remedial courses targeting unprepared minority students.</p>
<p>Second, supply generous official rescues to wipe-out failures, and even absolve students of blatant cheating (often rampant thanks to the internet) in interventions totally invisible to those who suspect bogus statistics. Some schools now even allow failing grades to be expunged after the final exam. {snip} I know of another school where written permission from the school&rsquo;s president was required before a black student could be failed. In a sense, many minority students are often treated as if they were members of an endangered species.</p>
<p>Third, accept no-questions-asked transfer credit regardless of the source. {snip}</p>
<p>Fourth, steer academically troubled students to certain courses, especially those taught by ideologically sympathetic instructors who virtually guarantee top grades, or at least courses where nobody fails. Such offerings are certainly known to counselors, but even ordinary courses now have inflated grades, so failure requires gross incompetence {snip} Or, if a hard-nosed grader teaches a required course, either pressure him or her to relax the curve or just put a more generous grader in charge. Ironically, relying on student evaluation to promote &#8220;good teaching&#8221; encourages easy grading and, as a side benefit, helps boost minority graduation rates.</p>
<p>Fifth, develop entire majors or at least individual courses whose tacit justification is to supply easy grades to struggling minority students. These constitute the familiar grievance-flavored group identity curriculum  &mdash;  Black Studies, African-American Studies, Chicano Studies, and the like {snip}.</p>
<p>Finally, surround minority students with a coterie of role models, mentors, and counselors to guide them through their rocky path toward the diploma. Further add individual tutors, centers to help with paper-writing, and more general classes on how to succeed in college. {snip}</p>
<p>With all of these tools available, it is no wonder that some energetic schools have successfully improved black graduation rates. But whether these concocted diplomas mean much is another story. My own sense is that these graduates have been hoodwinked by self-serving college officials. That today&rsquo;s college degrees, regardless of the recipient&rsquo;s race, are increasingly &#8220;manufactured&#8221; versus reflecting real learning is strongly suggested by a recent Bureau of Labor Statistics report. Specifically, contemporary &#8220;college graduates&#8221; are increasingly employed in positions once occupied by high school graduates. For example, in 1992, 17.6% of all college graduates were in positions classified as &#8220;noncollege level jobs.&#8221; By 2008, this percentage had doubled to 35.2%. In 1992, some 119,000 waiters and waitresses had college degrees; by 2008, this number had soared to 318,000. No doubt, unprepared black students who owe their diplomas to intense institutional effort and deception have fared even worse in today&rsquo;s difficult job market. In a sense, America&rsquo;s long quest for both educational equality and excellence is being satisfied by a combination of gullibility, linguistic trickery, and craven opportunism</p>
<p>Ill-prepared black students are the real losers in this deception, and one can only speculate why their liberal &#8220;friends&#8221; tolerate the dishonesty. Many would have been better-advised to enroll in a trade school and acquire a well-paid, marketable skill. {snip}</p>
<p>Some exceptions aside, granting ever more college diplomas only signifies the power of today&rsquo;s universities to counterfeit genuine accomplishment. Particularly worrisome is that many of these graduates have been trained for dependency. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>This fuse has been burning for a long time.  When the money for this extravagance finally runs out, the wailing and gnashing of teeth is going to be something to witness. The ruling class may be able to afford to keep this up for a while longer, but at some point the wheels will come off.</p>

		<p>Listen, why do you think there has been such a national campaign against older, experienced teachers in high schools?  (Anyone over the age of about 30 or 35 is considered to be crusty, out-of-touch and racist.)</p>
<p>The Right Wing wants to bust unions and pay peanut wages to temp workers - this is how they roll, and that&rsquo;s why they support illegal immigrant labor.</p>
<p>The Left Wing has tried every new fad possible in the last 60 or more years and nothing they&rsquo;ve tried gets little NaQuan and Shamikelle learning.  So now they go to ground zero and blame the entire profession.</p>
<p>So what do both sides do?  Join hands and villify the teachers as raciss&rsquo; and &#8216;bad&rsquo; and work to change the entire teaching corp by getting rid of all people over 30-35 years old.  Sort of like what they did on Logan&rsquo;s Run.</p>
<p>When they bring in the 22 year old Teach for America kids, they have 1) no qualms about inflating grades for &#8216;social justice&rsquo; and 2) they spend all their time teaching about the same &#8216;social justice&rsquo; gobbeldy-gook because THEY HAVE NEXT TO NO CONTENT KNOWLEDGE.  (&#8220;Oh, look at the pretty posterboard of cut-and-pasted text!  Great job Latrina!&#8221;)</p>
<p>The high schools, especially history and English classes, are full of social justice lessons where whitey is presented as the big bad man who holds non-whites down everywhere.  </p>
<p>Sad thing, it&rsquo;s white teachers, mostly female, who are doing this to the rest of us - painting all whites and all white civilization as uniquely bad, while all non-whites are good, kind and noble of spirit.</p>
<p>Many of us older teachers (30+) who still remember America as it once was, have seen the writing on the wall.  Those who grade according to real, old-fashioned standards get canned in a heartbeat.  The rest of us suck it up, give out A+&rsquo;s for 2nd grade work (I&rsquo;m not joking) and send our kids to private schools.</p>
<p>The colleges will change too.  My entire college career consisted of the old-fashioned, bust your chops professors.  (Thankfully)  But my last two &#8216;instructors&rsquo; were young liberals who (I am not kidding) had us sitting in &#8216;friendship circles&rsquo; talking about how we &#8216;felt&rsquo; about Africa and African society.  </p>
<p>Our educational system is dying, like everything else.  Can&rsquo;t do much about it save for protect yourself and your family.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t &#8220;whites only&#8221; as discriminatory as &#8220;minority only&#8221;?  <br>
And what if the minorities happen to be white as they are in four states (Hawaii, which is the only state that has never had a white majority, New Mexico, California, and Texas.<br>
I have an idea, how about objective, non-discriminatory entry and graduation tests?</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;the emphasis is now shifting from actual learning to equality of graduation rates.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s where the emphasis <i>always</i> was.  Equality of <i>opportunity</i> was what the elites <i>told</i> us they wanted; equality of <i>outcome</i> was the real goal from the beginning.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;many minority students are often treated as if they were members of an endangered species.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>No, more like members of a privileged and precious resource.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;My own sense is that these graduates have been hoodwinked by self-serving college officials.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Mine is that it&rsquo;s White America that&rsquo;s being hoodwinked.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Ill-prepared black students are the real losers in this deception&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>No, <i>White people</i> are the real losers in this deception. </p>
<p>It seems to me that Robert Weissberg is one of those dainty Respectable Conservatives who think it&rsquo;s okay to denounce anti-White discrimination, but only if you wash away your sins by claiming that it&rsquo;s somehow bad for blacks.  </p>
<p>Sorry, Robert, but I&rsquo;m White, and I only care about what&rsquo;s good or bad for <i>Whites</i>.  When you&rsquo;re able to turn that ideological corner, then we can talk again.<br>

		<p>Diploma fraud?</p>
<p>That hasn&rsquo;t changed a whole lot in the last 25 years.  Blacks have always been awarded certification though they can&rsquo;t do even average course work.  It has gotten a bit worse recently, however.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton, giving some moronic excuse, explained that blacks in his class didn&rsquo;t get it right, but he corrected their papers and passed them anyway.</p>
<p>Another professor stated that, &#8220;We are expected to pass a certain number of blacks.  If we do not, we are called upon to answer for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is just another indication of an empire in decline.  In just a few years it will all reach critical mass, and, ironically, it will be due&hellip;.basically&hellip;.to the PC crowd&rsquo;s insistance on expanding the sub-prime market for minorities.</p>
<p>It will all begin with an economic depression, coming to a neighborhood near you&hellip;&hellip;.and soon.</p>

		<p>An important driver of the everybody-go-to-college mania is a little known 1971 Supreme Court decision, Griggs vs. Duke Power. Griggs essentially bars employers from testing job applicants   &mdash;  - because of the &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; on minorities.</p>
<p>After Griggs, employers still had a need for competent employees, so they raised education requirements.  They began to require college degrees so as to roughly screen for trainable applicants for jobs requiring some cognitive ability.</p>
<p>Here is the history of Griggs   &mdash;  - from &#8220;THE BIG TEST: The Secret History of the American Meritocracy&rdquo; BY Nicholas Lemann (1999):</p>
<p><br>
1963 MOTOROLA CASE: </p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1963 a young black man in Chicago applied for a job at a Motorola television factory and was turned down on the basis of his score on an IQ test the company had given him.  He filed a complaint with the Illinois Fair Employment Practices Commission, which ordered Motorola to hire him.&rdquo;  pp. 156-157</p>
<p>1971: GRIGGS V. DUKE POWER</p>
<p>&ldquo;For several years the issue of racial inequality in whatever was being handed out on the basis of standardized test scores had been bubbling up to the level of consideration by the Supreme Court.  The most important early case was Griggs v. Duke Power, in 1971, a replay of the old Motorola case in Illinois.  A group of black employees challenged the use of intelligence tests by the Duke Power Company, because even if the test hadn&rsquo;t been designed to exclude blacks, it had that effect.  The Supreme Court came down unanimously on the pro-black, anti-testing side, ruling that a business could not use standardized tests in hiring or promotion unless the tests measured specific skill at a task, not general intelligence, and could be proved to be a &lsquo;business necessity.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
p. 204</p>
<p>1989: WARD&rsquo;S COVE v. ANTONIO</p>
<p>&ldquo;In two cases decided in 1989, City of Richmond v. J. A. Crosson Co. And Wards Cove Packing v. Antonio, the Court seemed to be signaling that it had reservations about affirmative action: in the first it struck down a requirement that 30 percent of the money spent on construction contracts by the Richmond municipal government be reserved for minority-owned firms; in the second it pulled back from the old Griggs v. Duke Power decision by saying that henceforth minority employees would have to prove that hiring standards were discriminatory in order to win lawsuits, rather than employers having to prove that they were not discriminatory.&rdquo;  p. 279</p>
<p><br>
1991: GRIGGS STANDARD, WATERED DOWN BY WARDS COVE DECISION, RESTORED BY CONGRESS</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1990&hellip;.Congress, pushed hard by civil-rights organizations and liberal and minority representatives, passed a bill that would overturn the Wards Cove decision and restore the Griggs standard in employment: there could be no use of tests that had a disparate racial impact unless the employer could prove that they were a business necessity.  Bush vetoed the bill.  In 1991, Congress passed the same bill again and this time Bush signed it into law.&rdquo; <br>
P. 279</p>

		<p>Part of what ails whites is the fact that we think we can only really compete with each other and if you believe history, it may even be true.  When this meritocritous option is denied us, as &#8216;the glory of the game&rsquo; in pushing the absolute limits of our abilities, we lose focus and purpose and let ourselves be pushed aside by the underqualified and unjustly enabled.</p>
<p>The obvious key to changing this then becomes finding a way to let whites who are not so encumbered by AA leave whites who are behind in such a dramatic fashion that inspires jealousy and a desire for change (while we still have hope of majority-population doing so, which is to say not more than 15 years).</p>
<p>I cannot see how that is possible without Secession because unlike lower education, colleges and universities all require public AA certification to get matching federal funding and can be sued for failures which are deemed racial in origin, filling the coffers of the very hate organizations whose Inquisition is now a private &#8216;charity&rsquo; for minority agendas.</p>
<p>So the next question becomes how we legitimize withdrawal from the Union, and the obvious answer is: California.  ENCOURAGING them to form a separate Aztlan nation state.  Or perhaps not a complete withdrawal but certainly a separate administration &#8216;until debt status X is achieved&rsquo; (similar to what EU members and noteably Germany had to go through after the Wall fell).  Creating such penalties and debt service schedules as seemingly forces them to declare independence to get out from under Bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Once the first State goes, others will follow and if it&rsquo;s not a white-nationalist area that leads the pack, all the better.</p>
<p>The other alternative is to create the white equivalent of the UNCF and simply take the hits in lawsuits and funding losses which result while emphasizing high quality through **private certification processes** whose merit seems to be more universally maintained and frankly contemporaneously applicable to the rapidly changing hard science and engineering of the technical/IT markets.</p>
<p>I will never forgive Greenspan for acting against national interests in insisting that we had too many high level professionals asking too much money for science and engineering posts.  That, as much as AA, has opened up the flood gates which has ensured a racial entrance to filling slots left by retiring Boomers and Gen-X.</p>
<p>So perhaps we also need to end the system of H-1B as corporate entitlement to low wage (minimum qualification) engineering.</p>
<p>This is a beatable problem.  It&rsquo;s just not beatable &#8216;within the system&rsquo;.  So we have to break it.</p>

		<p>This is happening more often than one who suspect. To compound the crime, minority applicants are heavily recruited for public sector positions where their true incompetence is oftentimes exposed. In the meantime, public service efficiency and the public treasury suffer accordingly.</p>
<p>I received a call from an acquaintance who accepted a public sector job after years in private industry employment. He described a black professional who had a four foot stack of paper covering every available inch of his desk in the same office.  How much work does this individual actually perform for the taxpayers?</p>

		<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me at all.  After these students are given a &#8220;college&#8221; diploma most go on to work for either the Federal or state government in very well paying jobs where they have little or no real responsibilities.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Some exceptions aside, granting ever more college diplomas only signifies the power of today&rsquo;s universities to counterfeit genuine accomplishment. Particularly worrisome is that many of these graduates have been trained for dependency.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t worry too much about the dependency part,,,they will also be granted an exceptional living through affirmative action  &mdash;  or maybe even become superintendent of one of the school districts mentioned in the article and go through their lives appointing whites to the real jobs beneath them- where the real responsibility lies while taking credit for the overall sucess of the district. (I am very aware of the inner workings of the mentioned university and surrounding school districts)</p>
<p>For those of you who are unfamiliar with what really happens behind closed school doors  &mdash;  -especially in Baltimore and surrounding counties please read the 11 steps for minority sucess that follows below.</p>
<p>First  &mdash;  The football coach threatens you if need to fail a failing student. (That never phased me)<br>
Second- The basketball coach tries the same thing.<br>
Third  &mdash;  After trying to contact the grandmother of the student 12 times to let them know their kid is failing  &mdash;  you eventually give up.<br>
Fourth  &mdash;  the principal gets annoyed that you have included him in the loop with respect to the failing student (now he is somewhat responsibe as well)<br>
Fifth  &mdash;  the parent finally emerges on June 10th and accuses you and the school of &#8220;Racism&#8221; when they get the 12th letter with respect to the failure of their son or daughter.<br>
Sixth-the 28 year old white liberal lawyer with an earring in each year explains to the principal that the parents (after 12 years of DAQUAN being enrolled in public school) didnt understand that report cards are printed 4 times for each school year and they never received them.<br>
An amazing thing has happened since I graduated high school 18 yrs ago  &mdash;  -remember when you had to get your report card signed?? Not anymore. Yes, they tell the kids to get them signed,,,but they never enforce the policy  &mdash;  -thats the trick. So when the parent says &#8220;I never SEEENNNTT no report card&#8221;  &mdash;  -that becomes the golden excuse.<br>
Seventh  &mdash;  -while the lawyer for the black kid is cooking up his case  &mdash;  the principal accuses you of not grading properly  &mdash;  not making enough attempts to notify the parent (always a grandparent)<br>
Eighth- the lawyer returns again  &mdash;  -the principal gets the runs.<br>
Ninth  &mdash;  the black kid passes.<br>
Tenth-They are accepted into Towson University.<br>
Eleventh-They are handed a college degree.<br>
You know the rest.<br>
Thanks, Merry Christmas</p>

		<p>I first became aware of the phenomenon of the magical significance that blacks give to diplomas and degrees while reading AR a number of a years ago.  The story was from South Africa, and it stated that many blacks thought a medical degree was a magic totem which gave a physician the ability to cure diseases.  Ergo, they could cure diseases, too, if only they had a diploma.  </p>
<p>After having read that, I paid closer attention to the way blacks I encounter think of diplomas.  If I&rsquo;ve heard words along the lines of &#8220;baby you get that high schoo&rsquo; diploma and then you&rsquo;ll be able to do anything you want, &#8216;long as you got that sheepskin,&#8221; once, I&rsquo;ve heard them several dozen times, and again will be too soon.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the surprise?  This was coming next, phony degrees after phony admission standards due to affirmative action.  This is how the current affirmative action president got into those elite schools and Harvard Law Review.  You didn&rsquo;t think he did it on his own standing?  Same story with his wife.</p>

		<p>I wholeheartedly congratulate Towson State and other such institutions of &#8220;higher learning&#8221; for raising the diploma mill concept to a much higher level than was previously thought possible.  Yes, even though a college degree is rapidly taking on the value of yesterday&rsquo;s newspaper, there&rsquo;s no good reason why under-achieving minorities should not have one of these joke diplomas for their very own. Although they probably can&rsquo;t find their way to the nearest restroom, let alone the classroom, the important thing is getting that diploma, worthless as it may be.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I first became aware of the magical significance blacks give to diplomas and degrees while reading AR. The story was from South Africa, and it stated that many blacks thought a medical degree was a magic totem which gave a physician the ability to cure diseases. Ergo, they could cure diseases, too, if only they had a diploma.&#8221;   &mdash;  - QD<br>

<p>Yes, and  similarly if you wear a suit, carry a briefcase, and hang a magic diploma on the wall, those will guarantee that you will start making big money. The checks will soon start flowing in. (But it has to be a genuine diploma! Fakes won&rsquo;t work.) </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the White Man&rsquo;s secret that he doesn&rsquo;t want others to find out. Those greedy whites try to keep everything to themselves, always trying to shut out the Black Man from getting his fair share.</p>

		<p>The really amusing part is the educational establishment denouncing &#8220;diploma mills&#8221; that pray on poor minorities.Paying a couple of thou&rsquo; to learn to draw blood and get a job in a hospital as a blood drawer is somehow demeaning, but it&rsquo;s empowering to have a worthless degree and no marketable job skills. Also,I see  the day coming were businesses require having taken math classes in college, regardless of degree, as away to screening for qualified employees. That will work until the inevitable law suits and grade inflation take hold.</p>

<p>If you wanted a heart transplant or brain surgery who would you trust? If you fly from NY to LA who do you want in the cockpit? No brainers. </p>
<p>It is still difficult to figure out all the bragging about the WW2 black pilots who never got shot down once yet there are NO black pilots since in Korea Nam Gulf Iraq Afghan. None in WW1 either.</p>
<p>This is puzzling and should make you wonder if the Tuskeegee pilots were real or not just typical revisionism in spite of the b&w; photos.</p>
<p>We saw Rosa Parks in the front seat of the bus in Montgomery with the well dressed business man with a coat and tie sitting behind her and are supposed to believe that was taken on the spot when she bravely defied the city? <br>
Since when did businessmen ever ride buses and not own their own cars? How did the photographer just happen to be on the scene with his large clunky camera in the 50s?</p>
<p>Who in the media took that pic?</p>

		<p>If you ever trouble yourself to read the ghostwritten drivel that elevated Barack Obama to national prominence, it is hilarious to see how much time that he spent bemoaning the fact that he and Michelle were EXPECTED to repay their student loans.</p>
<p>They both felt entitled to attend prestigious universities as a gift! </p>
<p>Both of these highly recruited diversity hires were complete washouts in private sector law firms. They did not hit the gravy train until they ditched their private employment positions and fastened onto taxpayer supported government employment (oh, yes, Michelle actually earned more in her do nothing jobs than her intellectual genius husband).</p>

		<p>At least in Canada, East Asian kids must work our little butts off if we want to earn our undergraduate degree.  The race factor does not quite come in play in Canada, once students enter the university, because there is no way to know the students&rsquo; races when there are 20000+ papers, assignments and exams to mark.  </p>

		<p>I always think of ol&rsquo; Dexter Manly everytime a see an article like this. We went to Oklahoma State University for 4 years on a scholarship. We has been banned from the NFL for life for failing the drug test (cocaine) 4 TIMES!! He announced afterwards that he can&rsquo;t read or write. How strange a scholarship to a college but the man is illiterate!!</p>

		<p>19 Anon:  The part that most interests me is that Michelle Obama, who had been making in the $100k range for her do-nothing job at the University of Chicago Hospital, (actually, she did do something   &mdash;   Divert the uninsured to the city&rsquo;s &#8220;community clinics&#8221;), saw her salary triple into the $300k range after Barack Obama won election to the U.S. Senate.  That should have steamed the feminists, that this supposed strong woman can only get a raise on account of a man winning an election.  Of course, whatever it is she did wasn&rsquo;t valuable enough for the UofC Med to replace her at any salary when she resigned to work on her husband&rsquo;s Presidential candidacy.  That job was still un-filled (if it even existed on paper) as of a month after the Inauguration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame, because UofC used to have a somewhat conservative reputation.  John Lott was tenured there for a very long time, until they ran him out on a rail, thankfully Jared Taylor&rsquo;s state taxes is paying his salary now.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sad to say that I&rsquo;ve seen this happening even to hard sciences classes. I took a physics class a few years back that they had gotten rid of the requirement to know calculus to be able to pass it.  The school identifies the courses that were easy passes with the codes &#8220;X&#8221; &#8220;XB&#8221; and &#8220;WA&#8221;. The X used to signify experimental focus, but some of the graduate schools wouldn&rsquo;t accept the credits from classes marked X, and XB anymore so they had to switch to a new code. </p>
<p>There still isn&rsquo;t a way to pass a calculus, or a trigonometry course without a lot of work, but if they can do it for physics, I&rsquo;m sure they can do it for chemistry. In 10 years the school I did much of my undergrad work at will be a liability to list on a resume, rather than an asset because of it. </p>

		<p>I wonder at what I.Q. level would it be appropriate to refuse admission to college and suggest trade school or some kind of training that does not require intelligence.  80? 85? 90?  I really would like to know.  Inasmuch as very few blacks have an I.Q. over 100, it would seem logical that there should be very few blacks in colleges.</p>

		<p>I signed up for some classes at the local community college and scheduled an appointment to see an advisor.  I live in an area that is 99 percent White and my advisor just happened to be a black woman.  The woman could not figure out how to give me credit for prior credits from other colleges and that is supposed to be her job!  Right after I walked into her office she was complaining about not being able to figure out how to print the end of term grades so I could sniff right off the bat she was incompetent.  After about 10 minutes of struggling through my piles of unofficial transcripts she finally called in somebody from the admissions office to help her with it.  She was actually nervous about getting in trouble if she made a mistake on them and she was half joking about getting fired and me being responsible for taking the food out of her baby&rsquo;s mouth!  This is a woman with a supposed college education who can&rsquo;t even do the rudimentary tasks that her job demands.  Instead of being a college advisor this woman needs to be in a job turning down beds at the Motel 6.</p>

<p>That is true of A LOT of people who should not be in college today. Making beds is honest work that needs to be done. All honest work should be considered honorable work. Not everyone is suited for college. But today it&rsquo;s considered a civil right. The basic idea behind this notion is that college will lift them up; but the reality, in fact, is that they will pull college down.</p>
<p>I would like to address the unfortunate attitude expressed by Roger Lee towards the skilled trades&hellip;. <i>&#8220;at what I.Q. level would it be appropriate to refuse admission to college and suggest trade school or some kind of training that does not require intelligence.&#8221;</i> </p>
<p>Anyone who has done any carpenter or cabinetry work, or metal work, etc. (which I have, just as an amateur) would know that these require a lot of measuring, knowledge of math, and calculation.  These are NOT jobs for idiots. Good work required intelligence.  What we need is more people of intelligence doing useful work, and not sitting at desks shuffling useless papers, ordering other people about just because they have an AA degree in black studies, voodoo, or whatever.   We need to give more prestige to the manual trades, and less to the desk jobs.</p>
<p>And why is college  placed on such a pedestal?  Because policy is made, and personnel departments run,  by people who went to college. It enhances their own importance. Naturally, they are going to laud what serves themselves.</p>
