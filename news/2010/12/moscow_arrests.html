<h1>Moscow Arrests 1,000 in Bid to Stave Off Ethnic Riots</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Benoit Finck, AFP, Dec. 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Moscow police arrested more than 1,000 youths Wednesday in a massive security sweep aimed at staving off another ethnic riot erupting following the deadly shooting of a football fan by a Muslim suspect.</p>
<p>AFP reporters at the central Moscow Kievsky train station   &mdash;   the site at which the big clash was reportedly being scheduled through the Internet   &mdash;   saw dozens of young men and girls as young as 13 being led away in handcuffs by helmeted riot police.</p>
<p>The youth chanted &#8220;Russia for Russians!&#8221; and raised the right arms in Nazi salutes as arrests continued throughout the expansive central Moscow square into the night hours.</p>
<p>Police said the city-wide operation involved 3,000 officers and resulted in the arrest of more than 1,000 people and seizure of everything from stun guns to knives and other small arms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin huddled with his most senior security officers in a bid to organise a response to the sudden security crisis as small fights flared across the city centre despite the overwhelming presence of the police.</p>
<p>Similar incidents were also reported in Russia&rsquo;s second city of Saint Petersburg as organised members of the far right descended on a major square that stands in the heart of the city amid modern shops and busy metro stations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gangs of Muslims were reported to be planning a counter-rally at Kievsky and a major Russian nationalist movement called on its supporters to come armed to the site.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust only yourself and those close to you,&#8221; a Twitter feed used by Russia&rsquo;s far right instructed its followers as the hour of the big street battle approached.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not panic and remove your women, children and the elderly from the streets,&#8221; the message added. &#8220;Victory is ours!&#8221;</p>
<p>Saturday&rsquo;s racism-tinged demonstration and ensuing tensions have exposed the many problems confronting Russia one week after it was awarded the right to host the 2018 World Cup.</p>
<p>Russian President Dmitry Medvedev warned that such riots threatened &#8220;the stability of the state.&#8221;</p>

<p>Do these Russian youths know that they would have been classed as an untermansch under Hitler, which would have meant a ticket to the concentration camp? If they want someone to rally around at least choose someone more intellectual and less evil. Galton, de Gobineau and Stoddard are miles ahead of Hitler.</p>

<p>Wahooooooo a target rich environment. I&rsquo;m sure that arresting so many White Russians will do much to quell the anti muslim feelings in White Russia. I am also just as sure that muslims staging a &#8220;counter rally&#8221; (which ALWAYS turn violent) will do much to soften anti muslim feeling in the white Christian/Russian communities. We should follow this closely, coming soon to our own streets.</p>

		<p>Well duh Mr. President. Did it ever occur to you that violent Muslim tribalistic invaders running around stabbing Russians to death might also threaten the stability of the state? What about admitting hordes of people who are hostile aliens to the Russian people? Russia should be for Russians, and anyone else who tows the line by living under the rule of law, not murdering, raping or robbing people because of their viewing Russians as infidels that exist only as targets and opportunities. How about expelling those who threaten the security of Russia and it&rsquo;s people?</p>

		<p>Certainly, this would be the state of the U.S. if our economy weren&rsquo;t so prosperous.  It seems the Russian state hasn&rsquo;t had the money and resources to properly reform their culture like ours has.  I&rsquo;ve also heard that Russia was able to reject multiculturalism to some degree since it was viewed as a western phenomenon.<br>
Good god, how can a country change so quickly?  What was manifesting in America prior to the 60s?  Because, it seems, directly afterward, the multiculturalism sickness invaded government, academia, the workplaces, unions, etc&hellip; so quickly and effectively.<br>
Maybe we can learn from the Russians.  Though we have a lot more to risk with demonstrating publicly, maybe there are other ways to encourage and display the cracks in society that have formed from all the anti white actions of the government.  I don&rsquo;t know, just pondering.</p>

		<p>The Western media has misrepresented these riots.</p>
<p>People are not being attacked because of racial differences. The friction comes from Muslims simply being unassimiliable with non-Muslims. Note Armenians have also been on the receiving end of ethnic violence â€“ but most people here would consider them to be white.</p>
<p>Many of those from the Caucasus look pretty much European.<br>
Whereas Moscow Mayor Sobyanin (former deputy prime minister), is at least half asiatic:</p>

<p>Just look at this picture which is one of the pictures of the year of the Unicef. It is made in a prison in Africa. The small guy stole some shoes, at least the other say so. Just ask yourself when you look for some seconds at this picture:<br>
Are we really the same?<br>

		<p>I believe that we are rapidly approaching what H.A.Covington described as &#8220;The Awakening,&#8221; whereby the white folk emerge from their drugged sleep en masse. I suspect that the Slavs and Latins will be first to wake up (angry) with Northern Europe being last. The elites will lash out viciously, but the die is cast.   </p>

		<p>History has taught us, that attempting to physically opress massive unrest only causes more.<br>
White Russians are angry and they are not as open as their Western counterparts. They want their Russia to be Russian, not Muslim, not African, and not multicultural. Russia is notoriously more conservative than the Western world, so things are bound to go differently there than they would here. However, if things continue, the only thing remaining of Western civilization may exist only in Russia. <br>
I can only see things getting worse and this can also be seen as a likely glimpse into our own future. <br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not the Nazi salute, it&rsquo;s the Roman salute. The Roman salute has been used for over 2000 years. In fact the American &#8216;Pledge of Allegiance&rsquo; used the Roman Salute until December 22, 1942, except it was known as the &#8216;Bellamy salute&rsquo;. It was replaced by Roosevelt with the hand-over-heart gesture.</p>
<p>The fact that the Nazi&rsquo;s used it for 12 years should not overshadow over 2000 years of tradition.</p>

   &mdash;   End to Illusion</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they don&rsquo;t know it, and I don&rsquo;t know it either.<br>
At any rate, the word you meant is &#8220;Untermensch&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure what to think of these rabidly nationalistic  Russian youth.   As J.Campbell said (above): &#8220;The Western media have misrepresented these riots. People are not being attacked because of racial differences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Russians are not racially or color conscious in the way that Americans are.  They have had no experience with color (meaning the dark races, not Asiatics). They are, however, very nationalistic.  Especially the youth. Their wars have been against other whites.  They are suspicious and sometimes downright hostile towards foreigners.  </p>
<p>Russia is a strange country, unlike any other. Although I am pro-Russian and sympathetic to Russian aspirations, when I was in Russia, there were times when I felt unconfortable. The cut of my clothes alone drew attention. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what they thought.  I did not like the stares. When they say they are against foreigners, one suspects they mean ALL foreigners. Posters (as above) who think Russians are going to preserve &#8220;Western civilization&#8221; are mistaken. Many of them are no friends of the West and want nothing to do with us.  Some see the West as the corrupting enemy. </p>
<p>I wish them well, but I would want a clarification of their views. And if I were there, I would stay carefully away from these demonstrations. After all, a foreigner is a foreigner.</p>

		<p>End to Illusion #1: That&rsquo;s not quite true. Russians made up an etire Regiment of Volunteer Soldiers that fought Stalin&rsquo;s Red Army.</p>
<p>The 30th Waffen Grenadier-division der SS was a Russian Division, whose ethnic SS shield, on the left side of their helmet, was the Russian Orthodox Christian Cross. </p>
<p>Cossacks also made up Waffen SS Divisions, as I have photographs in a book that show Cossack Machine Gun Units, with the Death&rsquo;s Head sybol on their caps, in German supplied uniforms, holding MG-42 weapons. </p>
<p>After the mass starvation that Stalin forced upon the Ukrainian people, in the 1930s, and the torment that the Communists had the Baltic States of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia endure, there were no shortage of Recurits for the Waffen SS in these Countries, as well.</p>
<p>Also, the Soviet Union invaded Finland in a Winter War offensive, in 1939, in an attempt to seize more land for itself. The Finns, armed by Germany, fought bravely against the goliath Soviet Army, blooding its nose, but eventually losing to the Soviets. They also joined &#8220;Operation Barbarosa&#8221; against the Soviets, in June, 1941.</p>
<p>People forget that the War was against World Communism, whose home base was the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>World Communism won World War II.   </p>

		<p>Russia is a strange country, unlike any other. <br>
____</p>
<p>From my point of view, Russia is not necessarily a European country (wholly). Non-Slavic people in Russia are not immigrants, they&rsquo;ve been indigenous to the soil long before Russian expansion. </p>
<p>The Caucasus region (where the word &#8216;Caucasian race&rsquo; comes from, thanks to Blumenbach) was and isn&rsquo;t a part of Russian empire. However it was invaded by Russians and the population was annihilated or forcibly removed to Siberia and Turkey.</p>
<p>If Russia is for Russians only, they must pack their troops and leave the region. The same is true for Central Asia (e.g. Kazakhstan) where Russians make a sizable part of the population and control everything.</p>

		<p>ghw 2 million Russian fought on the German side. They way Russian history reads is that there have been Germanics/Nordics in Russia amongst the Slavs since the beginning of time, as it was put to me, &#8220;Just as the Fox was amongst the Wolves in the forest, just so that the Nordics were amongst the Slavs.&#8221; </p>
<p>When one is in Russia it is easy to tell the difference between the Slavs and the Nordics, even though each may have blonde hair and blue eyes. </p>
<p>The reason why the National Soclialist disrespected the Slavs is because they let others rule them. </p>
<p>In 2007 all over Moscow there was graffitti &#8220;Hitler was right&#8221;. Russians are waking up to the crimes of Stalin and to communism. </p>
<p>J Campbell and you are very wrong. This is a racial conflict. Russians are very aware of color differences. The derogatory term &#8220;Chuka&#8221;, in Russian just defines all people that are dark. </p>
<p>You judge only by skin color, the Russian judges by origin, genetics and skin color. Until the early 1990&rsquo;s it was Russian law to have exact ethnicity in one&rsquo;s passport. To misrepresent was punishable by jail time. </p>

		<p>Preston Wigginton: I have no quibble with anything you have said. The facts you cite are correct and I agree.  I don&rsquo;t think you, J. Campbell, and I are on opposite sides of thie discussion.</p>
<p>And, once again, I agree with Deniz, who knows his history and ethnology. I might also point out that Russia invaded the Caucasus in the 1860&rsquo;s, displacing many peoples (i.e. the Circassians). So now, like vengeful karma, the Caucasus is invading Russia.  This is remarkably similar to the situation of the United States which seized Mexican territory in 1846 and got involved in the Caribbean (Cuba and Puerto Rico) in 1898.   We are now all experiencing the &#8220;backwash of empire&#8221;. The former colonial peoples are now colonizing us. </p>
<p>In Russia&rsquo;s case, though, the history goes back much further. The peoples of the Crimea (not quite the Caucasus) had for a centuries preyed upon Slavs for slaves and enslaved great numbers of Russians.  Kaffa was a great slave market.  So the Russians were settling an old score. I suspect the Russians don&rsquo;t make much distinction between Caucasians and Crimeans, just as Americans don&rsquo;t distinguish between Mexicans and Guatemalans.</p>
<p> <i>&#8220;In 1382 the Golden Horde sacked Moscow, burning the city and carrying off thousands of inhabitants as slaves. For years the Khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan routinely made raids on Russian principalities for slaves and plunder.  Russian chronicles record about 40 raids of Kazan Khans on the Russian territories in the first half of the 16th century.  In 1521, the forces of the Crimean Khan and his Kazan allies attacked Moscow and captured thousands of slaves.  About 30 major Tatar raids were recorded into Muscovite territories between 1558-1596.   In 1571, the Crimean Tatars attacked and sacked Moscow, burning everything but the Kremlin and taking thousands of captives as slaves. &#8221; </i> [Wiki]</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Slave raiding into Muscovy reached crisis proportions after 1475, when the Ottomans took over  the Black Sea slave trade from the Genoese and the Crimeans began slave raiding as a major industry, especially between 1514 and 1654.<br>
  <br>
In the 1570s, close to 20,000 slaves a year were being sold in Kaffa, ten times the number that had passed through there in the 1540s.    In 1589, taxes were collected on the sale of 4,000 imported slaves a year and the Poles may have had losses at an even higher rate throughout the entire seventeenth century.  In the 1700&rsquo;s,  Catherine the Great spoke of annual losses of 20,000. <br>
  <br>
It was not the Turks &hellip;but their vassals, the Crimean Tatars [whom  the Russians feared].  Russian fear of these Moslem descendants of the Mongols was deep-rooted. Year after year, Tatar horsemen rode north out of their Crimean strongholds across the Ukrainian steppe and swooped down on Cossack settlements or Russian towns to ravage and plunder. In 1662, Tatars captured the town of Putivl and carried off all the 20,000 inhabitants into slavery. <br>
  <br>
By the end of the seventeenth century, Russian slaves thronged Ottoman slave markets. Russian men were seen chained to the oars of galleys in every harbor in the eastern Mediterranean; young Russian boys made a welcome gift from the Crimean Khan to the Sultan. So numerous, in fact, were the Russian slaves in the East that it was asked mockingly whether any inhabitants still remained in Russia.<br>
  <br>
There seemed no way to stop these devastating Tatar raids. The frontier was too broad, the Russian defenses too scanty. The Tsar was reduced to paying an annual sum to the Khan, protection money which the Khan called a tribute,  and the Russians preferred to describe as a gift. But this  &#8220;gift&#8221; did not stop the raids.<br>
  <br>
In the spring of 1688, the Tatar Khan launching a campaign of his own, ravaged the Ukraine, threatening the cities of Poltava and Kiev and advancing almost to the Carpathians. When he retired to the Crimea in the autumn, 60,000 prisoners stumbled behind his horsemen.</i><br>
