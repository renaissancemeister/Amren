<h1><a href="https://www.wtop.com/?sid=2188517&amp;nid=149">Bramlett Gets PGA Tour Card and Cheer From Woods</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Antonio Gonzalez, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), December 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On the final hole of the final round of the final stage of the PGA Tour&rsquo;s qualifying school Monday, Joseph Bramlett delivered a putt that had him roaring, pumping his fist and high-fiving his caddie in celebration.</p>
<p>Sort of how Tiger Woods does it.</p>
<p>The former Stanford standouts now have even more in common.</p>
<p>Bramlett earned a PGA Tour card, joining Woods as the only players on tour of black descent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bramlett shot a 4-under 68 on the Crooked Cat Course at Orange County National, rallying from 33rd at the start of the day to make the cutoff for a tour card by two strokes. He finished 11 under at the grueling, six-round final stage of qualifying school to tie for 16th.</p>
<p>The top 25 scores and ties earned PGA Tour cards for 2011. The next 50 received cards on the Nationwide Tour.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re popping the champagne, baby,&#8221; Bramlett&rsquo;s father, Marlo, said by phone from San Jose, Calif. &#8220;Unfortunately, he doesn&rsquo;t drink. So we&rsquo;ll give him a bunch of water bottles when he gets back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Woods wrote on Twitter: &#8220;Congrats to Joe Bramlett for making it through Q School&#8221; and &#8220;Amazing feat considering he sat out a whole year with wrist injury. Can&rsquo;t wait to play with him next season.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bramlett grew up outside San Jose in a multiracial family  &mdash;  his father is black, his mother is white  &mdash;  and endured the odd stares at junior events when his parents followed him on the course. He plastered posters of Woods on his bedroom wall after the 1997 Masters, and he later competed in the Junior World Championship in San Diego with a team sponsored by the Tiger Woods Foundation.</p>
<p>When he was 14, he became the youngest player to qualify for the U.S. Amateur in 1992. He was All-America his freshman year at Stanford, when he helped lead the Cardinal to an NCAA title. Bramlett flew straight home to California to try to qualify for the U.S. Open, losing out in a playoff.</p>

		<p>Definitely look at the original article to see how &#8220;black&#8221; is Mr. Bramlett.  Then again, Tiger Woods isn&rsquo;t all that black, either.  Yet, their minority racial composition seems to define them both.</p>

		<p>The media says, because black people are not rich enough to learn swimming there are no black swimmers.</p>
<p>But it seams they are rich enough to golf.</p>

		<p>all over black America this will be the new life goal..<br>
membership in the PGA. Forget studying, forget real effort<br>
..this is where doing essentially nothing can really pay of big.<br>
Millions of blacks will drop out of high school to pursue this<br>
dream..and never give one second of thought that of 10 that make<br>
it..999,990 will be left with  no skills, no education, a set of golf clubs to hock on EBay and a lifetime to spend  unemployed or in jail.</p>

		<p>I guess since Tiger Woods tarnished his image beyond fixing they had to bring in another black to be a positive role model to all the thugs.  No doubt it will end the same, arrogance, greed, and a penchant for dating/marrying only whites girls.  Sounds like every other black athlete.</p>
<p>I must thank these types though.  Because of all of the &#8220;Affletes&#8221;  I no longer watch the only sport I used to like (NFL).  Most of my friends are starting to lose interest in all sports, too (aside from Hockey).</p>
<p>If even 20% of the white population did this, pro sports would be gone and blacks wouldn&rsquo;t be cutting class to shoot hoops and may have to depend on some other way to make a living.</p>

		<p>Fascinating, how only two of black-descent are on tour and yet to hear the old black players talk, you would believe they had so many magnificent players (beyond number), but were prohibited due to discrimination.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t they originate their own bpga, or bnfl, instead of conscription thru government edict?</p>
<p>It goes on and on.</p>
