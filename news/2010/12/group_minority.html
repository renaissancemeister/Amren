<h1><a href="https://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7832643">Group: Minority CPS Students Were Flunked Unfairly</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WLS-TV (Chicago), Dec. 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A parents group says thousands of Chicago Public School students have been unfairly flunked. </p>
<p>Parents United for Responsible Education or PURE has filed a complaint with the U.S. Education Department&rsquo;s Office for Civil Rights. They say the policy of flunking 3rd, 6th and 8th grade students based on standardized test scores has disproportionately harmed Black and Latino students. </p>
<p>&#8220;No school system should carry on policies that have been proven to increase and even speed up the student dropout rate. Especially at a time when the nation has committed itself to addressing this crisis,&#8221; said </p>
<p>CPS says it would be a disservice to promote a student who was not academically prepared. </p>

		<p>Yes, it is unfair.  If they can find their way to where the test is being given, then they should be passed.  </p>

		<p>Point A: Considering that black and latino students are the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of students in the Chicago school system, it would stand to reason that they would be a majority of those affected.  (When they are minorities they cry for special treatment, when they become the majority, they still cry for special treatment.  You can&rsquo;t win.)</p>
<p>Point B: Those tests are meaningless anyway.  Not because tests are a bad indicator of knowledge, but because even those black and latino students who DO pass the tests come into high school still with a third grade (or lower, and I&rsquo;m not joking) ability level in all subjects.  (So I believe that all blacks and latinos should be exempted from any and all state tests anywhere at all times.  Only give them to whites, and maybe asians because they&rsquo;re the only groups who will have the intelligence to do big boy jobs.)</p>

		<p>This story reminds me of the day at the Quickie Mart when I knew my world and me in it were headed toward extinction. The old guy in line in front of me made some stale joke about the sausage dogs and &#8220;Ate two Brute&#8221;. The clerk looked up and muttered &#8220;Uh, Whazzzit?!?&#8221; The customer goes, &#8220;That`s from Skakespeare`s Julius Ceasar! You mean you`ve never heard of Julius Ceasar?!?&#8221;  The clerk shot back in mid-morning exasperation, &#8220;Mister, I`ve never heard of Shakespeare!!&#8221; <br>
  The customer steals a quick glance over his shoulder to see if I`m following this and I tell him, &#8220;Quickie Mart, Dude!! Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not academically prepared?&#8221;  Nonsense.  They pass them in high school throughout the country every year for just showing up for class for four years, even though they can&rsquo;t read their diplomas or they read at only an 8th grade level.  </p>
<p>They might as well pass these retards. They do it in college in order to meet black quotas, knowing that the AA blacks there do not have a grasp of the subjects they&rsquo;re certified in.</p>
<p>But, can&rsquo;t you imagine how dumbed down these tests are to get any blacks to pass?  The ones who flunked have to really be in the 50 to 60 I.Q. range.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s perfectly obvious that until we can start talking about the obvious taboo, that public education systems in big cities will forever be in a Catch-22 between raising standards to yield quality graduates as the &#8220;rock&#8221; and the black and Hispanic failure/dropout rate as the &#8220;hard place.&#8221;  Therefore, every other news story will have &#8220;rock&#8221; as a theme, while the opposite ones, like this story, will be about the &#8220;hard place.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Interesting how blacks and hispanics are always playing into our hands if we look at what they&rsquo;re saying closely. In this case, we can agree and demand different tests for them. Or, that they be given passing scores just because of their ethnicity or skin color, always emphasizing separateness, but as if it was their idea (which actually it is). At some point, we could even reasonbly think in terms of resegregation, for their benefit of course. As if it would be best for them to be taught by their own people. Actually, there were some pretty good black schools during the Jim Crow era (Not well known). I don&rsquo;t know if that would occur now though, in that blacks have sunk a long way from those times.</p>

		<p>Racial discrimination is only unjust if it is on the basis of race alone. If it is on the basis of what correlates with race, such as academic performance, mental aptitude test scores, behavior in school, or felony convictions, it is appropriate.  </p>

		<p>Any sensible educator knows that Family and Home are the foundation of any student&rsquo;s academic career. The State (that is, the Schools) probably cannot fix what the Family and Home break. </p>
<p>I have taught for decades. When I hear parents screaming AFTER their students have failed, I hear dysfunctional family. The last time I was upbraided by a parent over her failing student, the parent was one who made a living as a stripper. She was irate with me and the school, yet she considered her lifestyle unrelated to her 14-year old&rsquo;s failing the seventh grade &hellip; again. May I mention that she was a Latin American &#8220;immigrant&#8221;? </p>
<p>Today, I teach college. The &#8220;race thing&#8221; may be even worse there. The &#8220;victim status&#8221; and &#8220;reparations&#8221; issues are so deeply entrenched in the popular culture that I am constantly reflecting on &#8220;The Emperor Wears No Clothes&#8221;, the H.C. Andersen tale. The emperor is naked, but the people are told not to point out the obvious. The tale ends with a phony procession in which the people applaud the emperor&rsquo;s clothes, as our brainwashed Lefties applaud Obama&rsquo;s Nobel Prize. I think of Orwell&rsquo;s &#8220;1984&#8221; a lot too. Here, the emperor is Big Brother, but the thought control is the same. </p>
<p>Parents, if your kids are failing reading, I have a question: did you read to them when they were babes in your arms? If your kid is failing math, did you play with numbers with them? Did you teach them to tell time, how to count money? Did you illustrate with your own life what it means to be responsible, disciplined and diligent? Of course not. And it must be Whitey&rsquo;s fault.</p>

Interesting how blacks and hispanics are always playing into our hands if we look at what they&rsquo;re saying closely. In this case, we can agree and demand different tests for them. Or, that they be given passing scores just because of their ethnicity or skin color, always emphasizing separateness, but as if it was their idea (which actually it is).<br>
&gt;&gt; </p>
<p>You can see but you can&rsquo;t say it and by the time it becomes possible to acknowledge the obvious, the basic infrastructure of society will be torn to shreds.</p>
<p>In this it should also be admitted that, no matter how smart you really are, if your social intelligence is low, so too is your likelihood of seeing through the illusions.</p>
<p>Social Policies are set, based upon populist appearance of truth.  Thus &#8216;sudden skyrocketing increases in black success, why we must open up all jobs to them!&rsquo; would only accelerate the downwards trend.</p>
<p>As usual, good ideas like segregation must come based on white initiative and planning.  Look for the moment when the national government is too weak or delusional to stop the separation and have a prepared 1-2-3 process to achieve it, with all necessary resources on the right side of the line to sustain new independence from what you have won free of.</p>

		<p>Yes, expecting people to work hard and follow the rules and meet certain standards is racist and hateful.  If not hiring felons is code speech for not hiring blacks and hispanics, then I think &#8216;raising taxes&rsquo; or trying to disarm the public is code speech against whites.</p>
